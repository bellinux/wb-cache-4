40|$|Pain {{is one of}} {{the first}} {{symptoms}} that alert you to the various diseases. It affects and reduces the quality of patient?s life and their physical, mental and emotional abilities. It depends on man how feels <b>the</b> <b>pain,</b> how succumbs to it or how much affects him. But <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> cannot be clearly quantified. The medical staffs often underestimate patient´s intensity, character and process of pain. As a result, the patients are more reserved in relation to the medical staffs. Unfortunately, there is an increase of dissatisfaction which is in conflict with the progress of their treatment. And there should be the nurses for contact with patients when they want it. Especially the nurses are the mediator between the patient and the doctor; thereby they perform the important roles in the health care centres. On the other hand, the patient care is very difficult. Therefore it was important to determine the quantity of nurse´s work in <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> management institutions, particularly <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> management clinics, an affect their psyche, an attitude to patients, their view of <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> management institutions, including information about <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> management clinics processing, the methods and the provided care. There were determined six aims: to find out the most common diagnosis and methods of <b>pain</b> treatment in <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> management institutions, as well as how nurses perceive the patients and care for their mental status in <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> management clinics, <b>the</b> daily routines which the nurses recommend to the patients and finally find out information about <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> management institutions in the Czech Republic. Based on the aims there were determined six research questions. Firstly, what is the most common diagnosis in <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> management clinic? Secondly, what are the most common methods for pain treatment? Thirdly, how are successful <b>the</b> methods of <b>pain</b> treatment by nurses? Fourth, how nurses perceive <b>the</b> patients of <b>pain</b> treatment clinics? Fifthly, how nurses care for patient´s mental status in <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> treatment clinic? Sixthly, what daily routine nurses recommend to <b>the</b> patients with <b>pain</b> treatment? <b>The</b> results showed that patients have often <b>the</b> chronic back <b>pain</b> in <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> management clinics in Pardubice region. In addition, there are the post-traumatic conditions, <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> associated with shingles, <b>the</b> post-operative <b>pain,</b> <b>the</b> joint <b>pain</b> and <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> associated with cancer...|$|R
5|$|Michigan, led by {{the young}} and hot-headed Mason, responded {{with the passage of}} <b>the</b> <b>Pains</b> and Penalties Act just six days after Lucas County was formed; the act made it a {{criminal}} offense for Ohioans to carry out governmental actions in the Strip, under penalty of a fine up to $1,000, up to five years imprisonment at hard labor, or both. Acting as commander-in-chief of the territory, Mason appointed Brigadier-General Joseph W. Brown of the Third U.S. Brigade to head the state militia, with the instructions to be ready to act against Ohio trespassers. Lucas obtained legislative approval for a militia of his own, and he soon sent forces to the Strip area. The Toledo War had begun.|$|E
5|$|Charles XI {{had complained}} of stomach pains since 1694. In {{the summer of}} 1696, he asked his doctors for an opinion on the pain as it had {{continuously}} become worse, {{but they had no}} viable cure or treatment for it. He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, <b>the</b> <b>pains</b> became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where the doctors discovered he had a large, hard lump in his stomach. At this point there was little the doctors could do except alleviate the King's pain as best they could. Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, in his forty-first year. An autopsy showed that the King had developed cancer and that it had spread through his entire abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|The 160 hidden panels do {{not form}} a {{continuous}} story, but each panel provides one complete illustration {{of cause and}} effect. There are depictions of blameworthy activities, from gossip to murder, with their corresponding punishments. There are also praiseworthy activities, that include charity and pilgrimage to sanctuaries, and their subsequent rewards. <b>The</b> <b>pains</b> of hell and the pleasure of heaven are also illustrated. There are scenes of daily life, complete with the full panorama of samsara (the endless cycle of birth and death). The encasement base of the Borobudur temple was dissembled to reveal the hidden foot, and the reliefs were photographed by Casijan Chepas in 1890. It is these photographs that are displayed in Borobudur Museum (Karmawibhangga Museum), located just several hundred meters north of the temple. During the restoration, the foot encasement was reinstalled, covering the Karmawibhangga reliefs. Today, only {{the southeast corner of}} the hidden foot is revealed and visible for visitors.|$|E

50|$|It {{is unclear}} {{as to how}} much <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> matrix is {{involved}} in pain empathy.

Some have argued that only the affective components of <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> matrix, <b>the</b> anterior insula and the anterior cingulate cortex, are activated when it comes to pain empathy.|$|R
30|$|The Spigelian hernia is {{suggested}} {{to be the}} cause of <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> since <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> symptoms, both <b>the</b> spontaneous <b>pain</b> and <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> during palpation of the wall had disappeared immediately after surgery. The small endometriotic cysts in the ovaries, and the superficial endometriosis were not painful during clinical exam before surgery and are unlikely to have caused <b>the</b> severe <b>pain</b> symptoms limiting physical activity nor <b>the</b> local <b>pain</b> in <b>the</b> wall. This also applies to the appendix. The fibrosis around the ischial spine may have given some Alcock-like symptoms, but does not explain <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> symptoms. It remains unclear why this Spigelian hernia caused such severe pain, since no bowel or omentum entrapment, or local inflammation was found.|$|R
5|$|The King {{sought a}} divorce, but his advisors {{suggested}} that any divorce proceedings might involve {{the publication of}} details relating to the King's own adulterous relationships. Therefore, he requested and ensured the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>Pains</b> and Penalties Bill, under which Parliament could have imposed legal penalties without a trial {{in a court of}} law. The bill would have annulled the marriage and stripped Caroline of the title of Queen. The bill proved extremely unpopular with the public, and was withdrawn from Parliament. George IV decided, nonetheless, to exclude his wife from his coronation at Westminster Abbey, on 19 July 1821. Caroline fell ill that day and died on 7 August; during her final illness she often stated that she thought she had been poisoned.|$|E
5|$|Regarding Hall's fate, the {{official}} investigation that followed ruled {{the cause of}} death was apoplexy (an early term for stroke). Some of Hall's symptoms— partial paralysis, slurred speech, delirium— certainly fit that diagnosis. Indeed, <b>the</b> <b>pains</b> that Hall complained about down one side of his body, which he attributed to many years' huddling in an igloo, may have been due to a previous minor stroke. However, in 1968, Hall's biographer Chauncey C. Loomis, a professor at Dartmouth College, made an expedition to Greenland to exhume Hall's body. Because of the permafrost, Hall's body, flag shroud, clothing and coffin were remarkably well-preserved. Tests on tissue samples of bone, fingernails and hair showed that Hall had received large doses of arsenic in the last two weeks of his life. Arsenic poisoning appears consistent with the symptoms party members reported: stomach pains, vomiting, stupor, and mania. Arsenic can have a sweet taste, and Hall had complained that the coffee had tasted too sweet, and had burned his stomach. It also appears that at least three of the crew, Budington, Meyer, and Bessels, expressed relief at Hall's death and said that the expedition would be better off without him. In his book The Arctic Grail, Pierre Berton suggests that it is possible that Hall accidentally dosed himself with the poison, as arsenic was common in medical kits of the time. But it is considered more probable that he was murdered by one of the other members of the expedition, possibly Bessels, who was in nearly constant attendance of Hall. No charges were ever filed.|$|E

5|$|The chief complaint, and {{the onset}} of the complaint, are usually {{important}} in the diagnosis of toothache. For example, the key distinction between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is given in the history, such as pain following a stimulus in the former, and lingering pain following a stimulus and spontaneous <b>pain</b> in <b>the</b> latter. History is also important in recent filling or other dental treatment, and trauma to the teeth. Based on the most common causes of toothache (dentin hypersensitivity, periodontitis, and pulpitis), the key indicators become localization of <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> (whether <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> is perceived as originating in a specific tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity of <b>the</b> <b>pain,</b> and factors that make <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> worse.The various qualities of the toothache, such as the effect of biting and chewing on <b>the</b> <b>pain,</b> <b>the</b> effect of thermal stimuli, and the effect of <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> on sleep, are verbally established by the clinician, usually in a systematic fashion, such as using <b>the</b> Socrates <b>pain</b> assessment method (see table).|$|R

She struggles over her father's relationship with Leesha, whom she likes at first. When Lauren is 12, her uncle Peter takes her for her haircut and she returns home with her long straight hair cut into a hipper, shoulder-length cut. Her boyfriend Victor turns out to be the son of her mother's boyfriend, David McClaren, which causes Lauren to feel awkward and disgusted. When Amy becomes pregnant with David's child, Lauren reveals what a total blow to her social life this will be and is furious. She later becomes accepting and supporting of her mother after she miscarries. Toward the end of the series, Lauren begins to hang out with a group of friends who embrace the straight edge culture, which puts her at odds with her mother.|$|E

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of June, Caroline had travelled north from Italy, and was at St Omer near Calais. Acting {{on the advice of}} Alderman Matthew Wood and her lady-in-waiting Lady Anne Hamilton, she rejected the government's offer. She bid farewell to Pergami, and embarked for England. When she arrived on 5 June, riots broke out in support of her. Caroline was a figurehead for the growing Radical movement that demanded political reform and opposed the unpopular king. Nevertheless, the King still adamantly desired a divorce, and the following day, he submitted the evidence gathered by the Milan commission to Parliament in two green bags. On 15 June, the Guards in the King's Mews mutinied. The mutiny was contained, but the government was fearful of further unrest. Examination of the bags of evidence was delayed as Parliament debated the form of the investigation, but eventually, on 27 June, they were opened and examined in secret by 15 peers. The peers considered the contents scandalous, and a week later, after their report to the House, the government introduced a bill in Parliament, <b>the</b> <b>Pains</b> and Penalties Bill 1820, to strip Caroline of the title of queen and dissolve her marriage. It was claimed that Caroline had committed adultery with a low-born man: Bartolomeo Pergami. Various witnesses, such as Theodore Majocchi, were called during the reading of the bill, which was effectively a public trial of the Queen. The trial caused a sensation, as details of Caroline's familiarity with Pergami were revealed. Witnesses said the couple had slept in the same room, kissed, and been seen together in a state of undress. The bill passed the House of Lords, but was not submitted to the House of Commons as there was little prospect that the Commons would pass it. To her friends, Caroline joked that she had indeed committed adultery once—with the husband of Mrs. Fitzherbert, the King.|$|E
