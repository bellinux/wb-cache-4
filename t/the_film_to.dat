40|$|Abstract- Thin mono-layer {{polypropylene}} (PP) <b>films</b> {{were produced}} <b>to</b> study {{the effects of}} processing parameters. Main difference in the crystalline structure of <b>the</b> PP <b>films</b> is considered <b>to</b> be caused by the orientation of the crystal blocks. As <b>the</b> temperature increases, <b>film</b> thickness decreases. Screw motor speed (SMS) increase results in increase of film thickness. Increase of winding speed (WS) causes <b>the</b> <b>films</b> <b>to</b> be stretched, making them thinner. As the temperature increases, tear strength of <b>the</b> <b>films</b> increases in MD but decreases in CD. Tear strength increases in CD with increasing SMS. As WS increases, tear strength in MD decreases. As the temperature increases, tensile strength increases in MD. When SMS increases, molecular orientation increases in MD causing tensile strength of <b>the</b> <b>films</b> <b>to</b> increase. Tensile strength decreases with increasing SMS in CD.
