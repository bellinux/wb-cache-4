5|$|The {{northern}} <b>transept</b> {{is named}} for Henry Gurdon Marquand, the benefactor of the Marquand Chapel, which {{burned to the ground}} in 1920 and which the present chapel was built to replace. An American flag flown by the USS Princeton hangs from the transept's north wall. The southern <b>transept</b> {{is named for}} Chester Alwyn Braman, the first donor to the University Chapel Fund. A staircase leads from the Braman <b>Transept</b> to the Bright Pulpit.|$|E
5|$|The south <b>transept</b> also {{contains}} three large murals: the Holy child praying, St. Thérèse of Lisieux (patroness of missions), and the Nativity. The {{north and south}} arms of the <b>transept</b> each contain two altars.|$|E

5|$|The south <b>transept</b> had {{historically}} {{served as}} the mausoleum for the Cavendish family, who resided at nearby Latimer. During Scott's renovations of the 1860s the <b>transept</b> was opened up {{to the church and}} remodelled, and only one Cavendish tomb survives today, that of John Cavendish, son of William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire, who had died in 1617 aged 11. Sculpted by John Bolt the Elder of London, the tomb features ornately carved strapwork above a sarcophagus, flanked by black coupled columns supporting small obelisks, and topped by a double-curved roof. The south <b>transept</b> also holds the 1726 pyramid-shaped tomb of Lady Mary Whichcote, wife of Sir Francis Whichcote who at that time owned Chesham Leicester; Mary Whichcote's elaborate funeral bankrupted Sir Francis, leading to his sale of Chesham Leicester to the Skottowe family.|$|E
5|$|The south <b>transept,</b> {{formerly}} the parish church of StOswald contains a piscina and sedilia {{in the south}} wall. On the east wall are four chapels, each with a reredos, two of which were designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, one by Kempe and the other by his successor, W.E.Tower. The south window is dated 1887 and was made by Heaton, Butler and Bayne to a design by R.C.Hussey. Other stained glass in the <b>transept</b> is by Clayton and Bell, by C.E.Kempe and by Powell.|$|E

5|$|Bregowine died in 764 and was {{originally}} {{buried in the}} baptistry in Canterbury, but his remains were moved to the choir of Canterbury Cathedral in 1123. This followed an attempt in around 1121 to remove his remains to another monastery, which came to nothing. The remains were placed by the altar of St Gregory in the south <b>transept,</b> after having been briefly placed in the north <b>transept.</b> Bregowine was later considered a saint, with a feast day of 26August, although Florence of Worcester, a 12th-century writer, recorded his death date as 24August. Other sources record the death date as 25August. His life was later written by Eadmer in the 12thcentury.|$|E

5|$|Chester Cathedral has an east-west axis, {{common to}} many cathedrals, with the chancel {{at the eastern}} end, and the façade to the west. The plan is cruciform, with a central tower (as is usual in English monastic churches), but is asymmetrical, having a small <b>transept</b> {{on the north side}} {{remaining}} from an earlier building, and an unusually large south <b>transept.</b> As the plan shows, the asymmetry extends to the west front, where the north tower remains from the Norman building, and the south tower is of the early 16thcentury. At the eastern end, the symmetrical arrangement of the aisles was lost when the end of the south aisle was demolished and rebuilt in an apsidal shape. The nave, choir and south <b>transept</b> have wide aisles on either side, and are lit by clerestory windows and large multi-light windows {{in each of the three}} cliff-like ends. To the north of the cathedral are monastic buildings, including the cloister, refectory and a rectangular chapter house. The façade of the building is abutted on the north by later buildings.|$|E

5|$|From about 1192 to 1230, Adam Lock, the {{earliest}} architect at Wells for whom a name is known, continued the <b>transept</b> and nave {{in the same}} manner as his predecessor. Lock was also the builder of the north porch, to his own design.|$|E
5|$|St Edern's Church, Bodedern (sometimes {{referred}} to as St Ederyn's Church) is a medieval parish church {{in the village of}} Bodedern, in Anglesey, north Wales. Although St Edern established a church in the area in the 6th century, the oldest parts of the present building date from the 14th century. Subsequent alterations include the addition of some windows in the 15th century, and a chancel, <b>transept</b> and porch in the 19th century, when the nave walls were largely rebuilt. Stained glass was also inserted into the windows of the chancel and <b>transept.</b>|$|E
5|$|The east {{window in}} the chancel is {{in the shape of}} a pointed arch and dates from the 15th century; it has three lights topped with cinquefoils and a hood mould. On the north side of the nave there is a {{rectangular}} window from 1865. The 16th-century south <b>transept</b> has windows in the south and east walls: the south window has three lights topped with trefoils in a 16th-century arch, and the east window is small and rectangular, using some dressings from the 14th century. The wide opening between the <b>transept</b> and the rest of the church is spanned with a large wooden beam.|$|E
5000|$|In 1875, {{the church}} was {{enlarged}} and reordered to designs by Sir Arthur Blomfield, who added a chancel at the east end and north and south <b>transepts</b> and [...] "fiercely normanized" [...] the interior. Internally Blomfield's chancel and <b>transepts</b> are Romanesque Revival, but externally they conform with Hakewill's neoclassical style.|$|R

5|$|The north <b>transept</b> {{contains}} {{three large}} murals featuring Jesus Christ: Jesus washing St. Peter's feet, the Sacred Heart, and the Pietà. The north <b>transept</b> also contains the tombs of two bishops. One {{is of the}} first Vicar Apostolic of the Vicariate Apostolic of Qingdao, Bishop Georg Weig, SVD who supervised {{the construction of the}} cathedral. Bishop Weig's tombstone shows obvious signs of defacement, being chipped around the edges, and with broken stonework at its base. The other tomb contains part of the ashes of Bishop of Qingdao Paul Han Xirang, OFM, the rest having been buried in his hometown, Han Village, Yucheng County, Shandong Province.|$|E
5|$|The north <b>transept,</b> {{which had}} {{previously}} {{served as a}} vestry from which the Poor Law was administered, was used to house the church's William Hill & Son organ, which had been installed in 1852 in the now-removed western gallery; the south <b>transept,</b> which up to that date had {{been used as a}} mausoleum for the Cavendish family and was completely walled {{off from the rest of}} the church and accessible only via its own door from the churchyard, was opened up to the church. In 1890 Cambridge Chimes were added to the tower clock, in commemoration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria.|$|E
5|$|The south transept's {{southern}} wall {{is nearly}} complete, displaying the fine workmanship {{of the first}} phase. It shows the Gothic pointed arch style in the windows that first appeared in France in the mid-12th century and was apparent in England around 1170, but hardly appeared in Scotland until the early 13th century. It also shows the round early Norman window design that continued {{to be used in}} Scotland during the entire Gothic period (Fig. 6). The windows and the quoins are of finely cut ashlar sandstone. A doorway in the south-west portion of the wall has large mouldings and has a pointed oval window placed above it. Adjacent to the doorway are two lancet-arched windows that are topped at the clerestory level with three round-headed windows. The north <b>transept</b> has much less of its structure preserved, but much of what does remain, taken together with a study by John Slezer in 1693, shows that it was similar to the south <b>transept,</b> except that the north <b>transept</b> had no external door and featured a stone turret containing a staircase.|$|E

5|$|William Wailes {{produced}} a {{design for the}} seven-light east window following a competition launched in 1846; however, delays in raising the money caused delays in its installation. Controversy over the design meant that it was replaced with the current depiction of the Crucifixion by Clayton and Bell in 1904. The tree design {{in the window of}} the south <b>transept</b> was also by Wailes and was installed in 1854. In the north <b>transept</b> is a memorial window to Samuel Lucas who died in 1853, designed and installed by the St Helens Crown Glass Company which later became Pilkington. Another Wailes design depicting the Offering of the Wise Men was installed in the Lady Chapel, alongside one designed by Arthur O'Connor. The windows in the choir aisles are by Clayton and Bell who also designed the memorial to Edward Colston which is in the north wall of the north <b>transept.</b>|$|E
5|$|A lean-to {{structure}} {{at the end}} of {{the north}} <b>transept</b> houses the heating system. There is a new western end to this building, constructed 2014, and the eastern end (which includes the entrance) can only be entered via the north door to the choir vestry.|$|E
