25|$|In {{general as}} {{we see in the}} graph below, high gas prices are {{typically}} associated to low storage periods. Usually when prices are high during the early months of the refill season (April–October), many users of storage adopt a wait and see attitude. They limit their gas intake in anticipation that the prices will drop before the heating season begins (November–March). However, when that decrease does not occur, they are forced to buy natural gas at high prices. This is particularly true for Local Distribution and other operators who rely on storage to meet the seasonal demand for their customers. On the other hand, other storage users, who use storage as a marketing tool (hedging or speculating) will hold off storing a lot of gas when <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>are</b> high.|$|E

500|$|Multiple reviewers {{have called}} the Sci-Fi Dine-In more notable for being an {{attraction}} than a food destination. One reviewer from The Guardian compares the Sci-Fi Dine-In to Epcot's Coral Reef Restaurant, writing that both restaurants [...] "are great settings" [...] where [...] "eating is awful". Sehlinger and Testa consider the prices too high, and the food too simple, although they praise the Reuben sandwich and the ribs. Schultz writes that the food is simple {{and that some of}} the beers are decent. The book DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Walt Disney World Resort & Orlando also states that the food is more expensive than it is worth. Ed Bumgardner of the Winston-Salem Journal shared this opinion as well, specifically singling out the restaurant's roast beef sandwich as a ripoff, despite calling it delicious. Peggy Katalinich of the Tampa Bay Times writes that, although the food is mediocre, [...] "Who cares? Food is besides the point". She goes on to argue that <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>are</b> low, particularly for sandwiches. In Frommer's Walt Disney World and Orlando 2012, Laura Lea Miller expresses disappointment that the menu no longer contains the playful item names it once did. She writes positively of the atmosphere, but considers the food mediocre. In the book Walt Disney World Resort: Also Includes Seaworld and Central Florida, Corey Sandler writes that the Sci-Fi Dine-In is [...] "a must-see eatery... for adults and adventurous kids" [...] and that [...] "the food is appropriate for a drive-in theater—very ordinary, but that's not really the reason you came".|$|E

2500|$|Generic {{drugs are}} usually sold for {{significantly}} lower prices than their branded equivalents and at lower profit margins. [...] One {{reason for this}} is that competition increases among producers when a drug is no longer protected by patents. [...] Generic companies incur fewer costs in creating generic drugs—only the cost of manufacturing, without the costs of drug discovery and drug development—and are therefore able to maintain profitability at a lower price. [...] <b>The</b> <b>prices</b> <b>are</b> often low enough for users in less-prosperous countries to afford them. For example, Thailand has imported millions of doses of a generic version of the blood-thinning drug Plavix (used to help prevent heart attacks) from India, the leading manufacturer of generic drugs, at a cost of 3 US cents per dose.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{for people}} in a drought living {{a long way from}} and with limited access to markets, {{delivering}} food may be the most appropriate way to help. Fred Cuny stated that [...] "the chances of saving lives at the outset of a relief operation are greatly reduced when food is imported. By the time it arrives in the country and gets to people, many will have died." [...] U.S. law, which requires buying food at home rather than where the hungry live, is inefficient because approximately half of what is spent goes for transport. Cuny further pointed out [...] "studies of every recent famine have shown that food was available in-country — though not always in the immediate food deficit area" [...] and [...] "even though by local standards <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>are</b> too high for the poor to purchase it, it would usually be cheaper for a donor to buy the hoarded food at the inflated price than to import it from abroad." ...|$|E

From March to November a steamer from Jamaica arrives every ten days, and from November to March every two weeks. In the winter time, when the weather is very cold, the Boston Fruit Company have a heating room which is kept at a temperature of about sixty degrees, and in this room may be put 10,000 bunches of bananas.
