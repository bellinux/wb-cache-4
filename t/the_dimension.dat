He sought and found the cursed sword Soul Edge, only to be pulled into <b>the</b> <b>dimension</b> that the sword's spirit inhabits. Escaping <b>the</b> <b>dimension</b> with his body {{drastically}} mutated, his memories and sanity initially lost, he now wields various forms of energy as weapons, while searching for fragments of the shattered Soul Edge that soothe the pain caused by his separation from the dimension's energies.|$|E
5|$|As {{introduced}} in Soulcalibur II, Necrid is a warrior who fought and defeated a former wielder of the cursed sword Soul Edge, and was pulled into <b>the</b> <b>dimension</b> where the sword's spirit, Inferno, inhabited. Instead of battling Inferno, he fled, and became trapped in <b>the</b> <b>dimension</b> for years. Warped {{physically and mentally}} by <b>the</b> <b>dimension</b> as a result, he escaped during the closing events of Soulcalibur, but quickly found that, without the dimension's energies, he experienced intense pain and would eventually die. Attacking travelers he perceived as enemies, he happened upon a fragment of Soul Edge and felt his pain dampened. Pursuing other fragments of the sword, he encountered Talim, who was also seeking them, and helped defeat the resurrected Inferno. His memories and sanity restored by the battle, Necrid closed {{the entrance to the}} void, trapping himself within.|$|E
