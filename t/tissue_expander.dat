25|$|In a breast-reconstruction procedure, {{within a}} {{multi-stage}} reconstruction-mammoplasty, a <b>tissue</b> <b>expander</b> (a temporary breast-implant device) is emplaced {{and used to}} prepare (shape and enlarge) the recipient site (implant-pocket) to receive and accommodate the breast implant prosthesis. In a non-implant breast-augmentation procedure, some fat-graft injection approaches feature tissue-engineering, which is the pre-operative, external expansion of the tissues of the recipient site to receive the grafts of adipocyte tissue drawn from the woman's body. Non-surgical approaches to breast augmentation can consist either of an externally applied vacuum-device that will expand the tissues of the recipient site. Moreover, in most instances of fat-graft breast augmentation the increase is of medium volumeusually one brassière cup-size or lesswhich usually is the physiologic limit allowed by the metabolism of the woman's body.|$|E

40|$|Eight {{cases in}} which soft <b>tissue</b> <b>expanders</b> {{have been used as}} an adjunct to {{reconstruction}} in the hand are reported. Cases involved reconstruction after skin grafting for burns and crush injuries as well as skin resurfacing in the management of the painful hand. Patient tolerance was excellent and the final result was significantly aided by the use of this technique. The technical details of expansion as well as complications are discussed. Temporary <b>tissue</b> <b>expanders</b> are being used with increasing frequency {{in all parts of the}} body. There has been little documentation, however, of their use in the upper limb (Mackinnon, 1985 a; Morgan, 1985).

40|$|Skin grafts can be {{obtained}} from several sources, both human and animal. Skin grafts can include all or a portion of the skin, including the epidermis and dermis. 1 More recently, the use of skin substitutes, dermal fillers and <b>tissue</b> <b>expanders</b> has increased surgeons’ and dermatologists’ ability to cover skin defects resulting from burns, traumatic injury, chronic wounds or excision of cancerous lesions. 2 The major sources of skin grafts are autografts, homografts and xenografts.

50|$|An {{adjunct to}} the {{utilization}} of local and locoregional flaps is the option of <b>tissue</b> <b>expanders.</b> They effectively increase the net skin surface area and provide skin that has the same texture, colour, and hair bearing qualities as the recipient site.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tissue</b> <b>Expander</b> - Breast {{implants}} This is {{the most}} common technique used worldwide. The surgeon inserts a <b>tissue</b> <b>expander,</b> a temporary silastic implant, beneath a pocket under the pectoralis major muscle of the chest wall. The pectoral muscles may be released along its inferior edge to allow a larger, more supple pocket for the expander at the expense of thinner lower pole soft tissue coverage. The use of acellular human or animal dermal grafts have been described as an onlay patch to increase coverage of the implant when the pectoral muscle is released, which purports to improve both functional and aesthtic outcomes of implant-expander breast reconstruction.|$|E
50|$|Tissue {{expansion}} {{is a common}} technique used for breast reconstruction. This essentially involves expansion of the breast skin and muscle using a temporary <b>tissue</b> <b>expander.</b> Three to four weeks after the mastectomy, a saline solution will be injected into the expander to gradually fill it. This process {{is supported by a}} tiny valve mechanism located inside the expander and it will continue until its size is slightly larger than the other breast. Typically it can take several weeks to months to complete the process. This <b>tissue</b> <b>expander</b> is removed after a few months and microvascular flap reconstruction or the insertion of a permanent breast implant is done at the time. Chemotherapy or radiation is sometimes recommended by the medical/radiation oncologist following mastectomy. These treatments delay the tissue expansion process by approximately four to eight weeks. Tissue expanders have silicone outer shells and either an internal valve or external port to allow for saline fluid injections.|$|E

30|$|Notably, {{some kind}} of breast <b>tissue</b> <b>expanders</b> should be {{considered}} a contraindication to MRI because of the magnetic marker of the filling valve: expander manufacturers list possible consequences such as overheating, possible expander displacement, and possible reduction of magnetisation of the marker [11].|$|R
50|$|Satisfactory {{hairline}} lowering is {{a balance}} between patient expectations and anatomical limitations. Scalp laxity is a primary determinant of extent of hairline advancement.

40|$|Purposes. The present paper reports {{clinical}} {{cases where}} nummular eczema {{developed during the}} course of breast reconstruction by means of implantation and evaluates the occurrence patterns and ratios of this complication. Methods. 1662 patients undergoing breast reconstruction were reviewed. Patients who developed nummular eczema during the treatment were selected, and a survey was conducted on these patients regarding three items: (1) the stage of the treatment at which nummular eczema developed; (2) time required for the lesion to heal; (3) location of the lesion on the reconstructed breast(s). Furthermore, histopathological examination was conducted to elucidate the etiology of the lesion. Results. 48 patients (2. 89 %) developed nummular eczema. The timing of onset varied among these patients, with lesions developing after the placement of <b>tissue</b> <b>expanders</b> for 22 patients (45. 8 %); after the <b>tissue</b> <b>expanders</b> were replaced with silicone implants for 12 patients (25 %); and after nipple-areola complex reconstruction for 14 patients (29. 2 %). Nummular eczema developed both in periwound regions (20 cases: 41. 7 %) and in nonperiwound regions (32 cases: 66. 7 %). Histopathological examination showed epidermal acanthosis, psoriasiform patterns, and reduction of sebaceous glands. Conclusions. Surgeons should recognize that nummular eczema is a potential complication of breast reconstruction with <b>tissue</b> <b>expanders</b> and silicone implants...|$|R
5000|$|Typically done in {{the same}} {{procedure}} of a mastectomy, a <b>tissue</b> <b>expander</b> {{is placed in the}} sub-pectoral pocket more colloquially considered to be under the chest tissue. Over the course of a few months saline solution is injected into a tube inside of the expander, which allows for the expansion of the tissue until the tissue is stretched to the appropriate size. Following operations provide for the removal of the expander, placement of a permanent implant and areolar reconstruction.|$|E
50|$|However, breast MRI {{has long}} been {{regarded}} to have disadvantages. For example, although it is 27-36% more sensitive, it has been claimed to be less specific than mammography. As a result, MRI studies may have more false positives (up to 30%), which may have undesirable financial and psychological costs. It is also a relatively expensive procedure, and one which requires the intravenous injection of gadolinium, which has been implicated in a rare reaction called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Although NSF is extremely uncommon, patients {{with a history of}} renal disease {{may not be able to}} undergo breast MRI. Further, an MRI may not be used for screening patients with a pacemaker or breast reconstruction patients with a <b>tissue</b> <b>expander</b> due to the presence of metal.|$|E
50|$|The defect {{created at}} the donor site is usually {{positioned}} at the central/lateral forehead. The defect can be closed by pulling the different {{sides of the}} wound together in vertical and horizontal direction. If there is a resulting defect after closure it is situated high in the forehead and it closes by secondary healing. In {{spite of the fact}} that, as a result, the eyebrow could be distorted, this is usually avoided. As a result of a large initial defect, the flap has to be larger and the bigger the forehead defect will be. When there is a large resultant forehead defect it logically lies closer to the eyebrow. That is why there is a significant risk of superior eyebrow malposition, especially if a horizontal or oblique oriented forehead flap is used. Then the solution is to close the remaining defect with a skin graft. However a skin graft is esthetically inferior and will always look like a shiny, irregularly pigmented, mismatched piece of skin. Alternatively, secondary placement of a <b>tissue</b> <b>expander</b> in the forehead can be used to correct the eyebrow malposition and to excise the skin graft and primarily close the forehead defect.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Soft tissue {{limitations}} are encountered in implant dentistry, {{due to the}} loss of alveolar bone. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the outcome of soft tissue preparation using Osmed® self-inflating soft <b>tissue</b> <b>expanders</b> with different in situ times in two implantation techniques. Material and methods: Osmed® self-inflating soft <b>tissue</b> <b>expanders</b> were implanted in goats using a tunnel approach and a flap approach. The animals were sacrificed after 1 h (controls) and 40 days (treated). A tattoo technique for stereographic measurements was used to look for soft tissue surface gain. Histological and histomorphometric analyses were performed to quantify and compare the changes in soft tissue volume and bone volume after 1 h and 40 days of implantation. Results: After 40 days, the expansion was visible and none of the goats had shown any inflammation. The space between the soft tissue and the bone was filled by the completely expanded expander and surrounding connective tissue. Between the test groups and the control groups, there was no histological difference in the structure of the soft tissue. Conclusions: All the <b>tissue</b> <b>expanders</b> expanded to their maximum size (2. 8 times) and were a reliable product for creating a space between soft tissue and bone. The overlying soft tissue remained in excellent shape. There was no difference in the soft tissue volume and the bone volume between the tunnel and the flap approach after 40 days...|$|R

5000|$|Direct to Implant ("One-Step") Breast Reconstruction Post-mastectomy {{reconstruction}} with {{a direct}} to implant, or [...] "one-step" [...] approach {{allows for a}} single-stage reconstruction of the breast mound in select patients. This approach is best suited for patients with good preservation of the breast skin after mastectomy. A permanent implant is inserted immediately following the mastectomy, forgoing the initial placement of a <b>tissue</b> <b>expander</b> and subsequent expansion process. At {{the time of the}} initial post mastectomy reconstruction operation, the implant is positioned on the chest wall behind the pectoralis major muscle. Today, {{with the use of a}} dermal matrix (such as AlloDerm®), the surgeon can frequently use a permanent implant of the desired definitive volume during the initial surgery, provided the amount and quality of the breast skin remaining after mastectomy can accommodate the volume. The patient will have the definitive breast volume and approximate shape after the first operation. Depending on the quality of the result after allowing the initial reconstruction to settle and heal for a few months, a second stage reconstruction creating a more refined breast shape may still be desirable. This is an outpatient procedure that involves minor refinements in contour and symmetry potentially without exchanging the implant. The initial implant placement, and possible second stage, each take about one hour in the operating room.|$|E

40|$|Plastic {{surgeons}} {{are frequently}} faced with difficult and challenging soft tissue defects {{in all areas}} of the body. To reconstruct these defects, there are many operative approaches available to the reconstructive surgeon including skin grafts, local flaps, regional flaps, and free-tissue transfer. Despite these many options, occasionally the best alternative for reconstruction of a wound is tissue expansion, where skin of similar quality, texture, and color can be used to close a soft tissue defect. Unfortunately, there are significant problems related to <b>tissue</b> <b>expander</b> reconstruction including a complication rate as high as 50 %. As a result, <b>tissue</b> <b>expander</b> reconstruction has not achieved the widespread popularity commensurate with its potential clinical utility. To reduce the complication rate related to open <b>tissue</b> <b>expander</b> placement, and consequently to improve its clinical utility, we have employed endoscopic techniques for the placement of tissue expanders. Endoscopic approaches are currently being used in many areas of surgery and have resulted in substantial benefits. Endoscopic placement of tissue expanders has the benefit of reducing operative time, major complication rate, time to full expansion, and length of hospital stay.

40|$|AbstractGiant omphaloceles often {{present with}} a loss of {{abdominal}} domain. An intact sac may permit simple daily dressings to promote epithelialization for a delayed operative closure; a ruptured sac presents challenges.

We present a case of a ruptured omphalocele sac in which non-operative management was not possible – silo placement and reduction was unsuccessful {{due to a lack of}} abdominal domain. We used an acellular human dermal matrix (Alloderm, Life Cell, Branchburg, NJ), sutured to the patient's fascia to provide coverage of the omphalocele contents. There was insufficient skin to cover the majority of the graft. <b>Tissue</b> <b>expanders</b> had to be removed due to infection. With regular dressing changes, the tissue underneath the graft granulated and epithelialized and the graft lifted off. Skin grafting was not required.

40|$|Use of <b>tissue</b> <b>expander</b> in {{the recent}} decade has {{revolutionized}} the plastic surgery. The tissue expansion technique is advantageous in body reconstruction because it {{makes it possible to}} resurface the defects resulting from excision of burn scars with neighboring skin similar in color and texture and superior to skin grafts or distant flaps.

Findings of prior studies regarding risk factors associated with complications in <b>tissue</b> <b>expander</b> may not hold for Asian populations, since most of these studies involved Caucasian patients. In this study, we surveyed risk factors in the Taiwanese population, providing additional evidence about the important differences and discuss the implications for clinical practice. MethodsPatients who underwent immediate, two-stage, <b>tissue</b> <b>expander</b> breast reconstruction from December 2008 to August 2014 in the National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan were included. Follow-up observations of all patients were conducted until December 2014. Complications occurring during the <b>tissue</b> <b>expander</b> stage were evaluated. Multivariate regression modeling was used to identify risk factors for complications. ResultsA total of 246 consecutive, immediate, smooth round <b>tissue</b> <b>expander</b> placements were performed for breast reconstruction. The most common complication was skin necrosis (4. 9 %), followed by wound dehiscence (4. 1 %). In the multivariate model, body mass index (BMI)  ≥  24  kg/m 2 was the only risk factor that reached statistical significance (odds ratio: 2. 41, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 17 – 4. 96). ConclusionWe provided evidence that racial disparities {{have an impact on}} the risk factors for complications associated with <b>tissue</b> <b>expander</b> breast reconstruction. BMI≥ 24  kg/m 2 was the only risk factor significantly associated with complications.

40|$|Breast {{reconstruction}} is {{an option}} for women undergoing modified radical mastectomy due to a diagnosis of breast cancer. In certain patients, breast reconstruction is performed by insertion of a temporary <b>tissue</b> <b>expander</b> prior to the placement of permanent breast implants. Some of these patients, following mastectomy, may require chest wall irradiation to prevent loco regional relapse. The compatibility of radiation and tissue expanders placed in the chest wall is of major concern to the radiation oncologist. Clinically undetectable changes can occur in the <b>tissue</b> <b>expander</b> {{during the course of}} radiation therapy. This can lead to radiation treatment set-up changes, variation in tissue expansion resulting in unwanted cosmesis, and deviation from the prescribed radiation dose leading to over and/or under dosing of tumor burden. At Howard University hospital, a CT scan was utilized to evaluate the status of the temporary <b>tissue</b> <b>expander</b> during radiation treatment to enable us to prevent radiation treatment related complications resulting from dosimetric discrepancies. CT images of the <b>tissue</b> <b>expander</b> were obtained through the course of treatment. To avoid a 'geographic miss' the amount of fluid injected into the <b>tissue</b> <b>expander</b> was kept constant following patient's satisfaction with the size of the breast mound. The CT scans allowed better visualization of the prosthesis and its relation to the surrounding tumor bed. This technique ensured that anatomical changes occurring during radiation treatment, if any, were minimized. Repeated dosimetry evaluations showed no changes to the prescribed dose distribution. A CT of the reconstructed breast provides an important quality control. Further studies with greater number of patients are required for confirming this impact on radiation treatment...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Tissue</b> <b>expanders</b> {{have become}} {{established}} instruments for scalp reconstruction.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 21 patients who had undergone treatment for scalp lesions using <b>tissue</b> <b>expanders</b> without any complications and measured 2 variables: the volume of the expanders per area of the excised lesions and the hypothetical stretched functional skin width relative to the width of the excised lesions. We also sought to evaluate the relationship between these 2 variables and the need for revision surgery during the postoperative course. Results: The need for revision surgery was statistically higher in patients with a volume of 7 [*]ml/cm 2 lesion or less and width of functional skin of less than 2. 5 [*]cm/cm lesion (P < 0. 05). For scar repairs, the required size and volume of the expanders tended to be larger than those required for any other lesions. Conclusions: Expanders that generate functional skin at least more than 2. 5 times the width of the lesion and have a volume more than 7 [*]ml/cm 2 lesion are necessary to cover scalp lesions without complications...|$|R
