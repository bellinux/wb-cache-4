5|$|In {{the final}} stages of {{end-of-life}} care, midazolam is routinely used at low doses via subcutaneous injection to help with agitation, myoclonus, restlessness or anxiety in the last hours or days of life. At higher doses during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> of life, midazolam is considered a first line agent in palliative continuous deep sedation therapy when it is necessary to alleviate intolerable suffering not responsive to other treatments, but the need for this is rare.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} week of August 1914, the German Foreign Office and members of the {{military}} suggested attempting to use the pan-Islamic movement to destabilise the British Empire and begin an Indian revolution. The argument was reinforced by Germanophile explorer Sven Hedin in Berlin two weeks later. General Staff memoranda in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> of August confirmed the perceived feasibility of the plan, predicting that an invasion by Afghanistan could cause a revolution in India.|$|E

He had been married to one woman since the 1880s and to the other since the 1890s. He was posthumously elected to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989.|$|E
40|$|Background: To analyse the {{prevalence}} of seizures and use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the end-of-life (EOL) phase of patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) and to identify patient characteristics associated with the occurrence of seizures in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life. Methods: Patients were recruited from a cohort of adults with HGG diagnosed in 2005 and 2006 in three tertiary referral centres for patients with brain tumour. Physicians involved in the EOL care of patients who had HGG and had died were asked to fill in a questionnaire regarding seizures and antiepileptic treatment in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 3 months and in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life. Data on seizures and use of AEDs before the EOL phase were obtained from medical correspondence and hospital medical charts. Results: Out of 155 patients who had died, data for 92 patients were eligible for analysis. Twenty-nine percent of these 92 patients had seizures during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life; 33 % of patients {{had a history of}} seizures and 22 % did not. Besides a history of status epilepticus (p= 0. 047), we identified no other significant risk factors for developing seizures in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life. Seventy percent of all patients used AEDs before <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life. In 35 % of patients in whom AEDs were tapered, seizures occurred in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that seizures are a common symptom in patients with HGG during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life and emphasise the importance of adequate AED treatment throughout the EOL phase...|$|R

5|$|On 21 March 1918, the 1st Battalion was in front-line {{trenches}} near St. Quentin {{when the}} German Army launched Operation Michael, the opening attack in their Spring Offensive. The battalion was virtually wiped out, losing 19 officers and 662 {{men in the}} attack itself and the withdrawal which followed.

5|$|The {{attack on}} Yokosuka {{was an air}} raid {{conducted}} by the United States Navy on 18July 1945 during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> of the Pacific War.

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> of World War II, {{warships}} of the United States Navy, the British Royal Navy, and the Royal New Zealand Navy bombarded {{industrial and}} military facilities in Japan. Most of these bombardments involved battleships and cruisers which caused heavy damage {{to several of}} the factories targeted, as well as nearby civilian areas. A major goal of the attacks was to provoke the Japanese military into committing some of its reserve force of aircraft into battle. However, the Japanese {{did not attempt to}} attack the Allied bombardment forces, and none of the involved warships suffered any damage.|$|E

5|$|Fox soon regretted its decision, and re-opened {{negotiations}} with Monroe later in June; a settlement {{about a new}} contract, including re-commencing Something's Got to Give and a starring role in the black comedy What a Way to Go! (1964), was reached later that summer. To repair her public image, Monroe engaged in several publicity ventures, including interviews for Life and Cosmopolitan and her first photo shoot for Vogue. For Vogue, she and photographer Bert Stern collaborated for two series of photographs, one a standard fashion editorial and another of her posing nude, which were both later published posthumously with the title The Last Sitting. In <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> of her life, she was also planning on starring in a biopic of Jean Harlow.|$|E
5|$|Hindenburg was {{commissioned}} {{late in the}} war {{and as a result}} had a brief service career. The ship took part in a handful of short fleet operations as the flagship of the IScouting Group in 1917–18, though saw no major action. The proposed final sortie of the fleet in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> of the war came to nothing when the crews of the capital ships mutinied. Hindenburg was subsequently interned {{with the rest of the}} German battlecruisers at Scapa Flow in November 1918. Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered the ships be scuttled on 21 June 1919. Hindenburg was the last of the ships to sink. She was raised in 1930 and broken up for scrap over the following two years.|$|E
5|$|In February 1999, Payton {{announced}} that he had a rare autoimmune liver disease known as primary sclerosing cholangitis, which may have led to his cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). He spent his final months as an advocate for organ transplants, appearing in many commercials to encourage others to donate organs, although by the time his first appeal was recorded, his illness was already too far advanced for transplantation to have been a viable option. In April of that year, Payton made a final public appearance at a Chicago Cubs game with Mike Ditka, where he threw the game's ceremonial first pitch. Author Don Yaeger worked with him during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> of his life to create his autobiography, Never Die Easy.|$|E

5|$|Schubert {{had been}} {{struggling}} with syphilis since 1822–23, and suffered from weakness, headaches and dizziness. However, {{he seems to have}} led a relatively normal life until September 1828, when new symptoms such as effusions of blood appeared. At this stage he moved from the Vienna home of his friend Franz von Schober to his brother Ferdinand's house in the suburbs, following the advice of his doctor; unfortunately, this may have actually worsened his condition. However, up until <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> of his life in November 1828, he continued to compose an extraordinary amount of music, including such masterpieces as the three last sonatas.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days later}} Edwards likely killed Günter Steinhausen, {{a friend of}} Marseille. The next day, 7 September 1942, another close friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt was posted missing in action. These {{personal}} losses weighed heavily on Marseille's mind along with his family tragedy. It was noted he barely spoke and became more morose in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> of his life. The strain of combat also induced consistent sleepwalking at night and other symptoms that {{could be construed as}} posttraumatic stress disorder. Marseille never remembered these events.|$|E
5|$|While U.S. {{support for}} China {{was a reason}} for the war, the U.S. Army did not deploy major ground forces there, {{although}} U.S. air and service units played a vital role. After being driven out of Burma in 1942, a provisional regiment of the U.S. Army (Merrill's Marauders) participated in the reconquest of Northern Burma in 1944, and two regiments took part in the Central Burma Campaign the following year before moving on into China. In response to U.S. Army Air Forces operations from China, the Japanese drove the Americans and Chinese from eastern China. Only in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> of the war did the tide turn in favor of the Allies in China.|$|E

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> {{of the war}} the {{remnants}} of the 366th Independent Infantry Battalion were pursued by Australian Army patrols, air attacks and groups of local Dayaks organised by the Australian Services Reconnaissance Department. These attacks led to the disintegration of the unit. Major General Akashi led {{the remnants}} of the forces stationed at Brunei {{as well as a number}} of Japanese civilians to the inland town of Tenom; this trek took 40 days and involved traversing mountainous and trackless terrain. However, the forces involved suffered heavy casualties, with 50 percent of the 367th Battalion's soldiers being killed between 10 June and the end of the war. The 369th and 370th Independent Infantry Battalions did not see combat, and remained largely intact at the end of the war. Following the Japanese surrender, the survivors of the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade were concentrated in locations selected by the Australian forces.|$|E
5|$|Henry was {{probably}} born in England in 1068, {{in either the}} summer or <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> of the year, possibly {{in the town of}} Selby in Yorkshire. His father was William the Conqueror, the Duke of Normandy, who had invaded England in 1066 to become the King of England, establishing lands stretching into Wales. The invasion had created an Anglo-Norman elite, many with estates spread across both sides of the English Channel. These Anglo-Norman barons typically had close links to the kingdom of France, which was then a loose collection of counties and smaller polities, under only the minimal control of the king. Henry's mother, Matilda of Flanders, was the granddaughter of Robert II of France, and she probably named Henry after her uncle, King Henry I of France.|$|E
5|$|In March 1944, when Hungary {{realised}} {{that it was}} on {{the losing}} side in the war and began to negotiate with the Allies, Germany took control of the country, including the annexed territories, during Operation Margarethe I. This was followed by the collection and transport of the remaining Jews in the occupied territories to extermination camps, resulting in the deaths of 85 per cent of the Jews in the occupied territories. Prior to their withdrawal from the Balkans {{in the face of the}} advance of the Soviet Red Army, the Germans evacuated 60,000–70,000 Volksdeutsche from Bačka and Baranja to Austria. Bačka and Baranja were restored to Yugoslav control when the Germans were pushed out of the region by the Red Army in late 1944. Međimurje and Prekmurje remained occupied until <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> of the war.|$|E
