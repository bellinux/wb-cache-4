A characteristic feature of the said invention is that a quick-setting adhesive is applied {{to the base of the}} component to fix the component in position until soldering is carried out...|$|E
40|$|In {{commercial}} and industrial activities, {{there is often a}} need for reducing or controlling heat and mass transfer between outside environment and indoor compartments with controlled atmosphere, warranting, simultaneously, an easy circulation of people and equipments. In practical terms, the confinement of a given space can be achieved with aerodynamic barriers (air curtains) constituted by one or more air jets. In the present paper, the loss of efficiency of a vertical downward air curtain due to the seesaw permanent movement of a person is analyzed. Results show a systematic loss of the sealing efficiency (10 to 20 %) of the air curtain device when the doorway is periodically crossed by a computer controlled manikin “Roberta” relatively to the results obtained without this <b>traversing</b> <b>movement...</b>|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{improvement}} of central traversing system on rotor spinning machines, where rectilinear motion with variable stroke is used. A new system of traversing rod with implemented set of magnetic-mechanical energy accumulators is described. Mathematical model of this system is analysed in the MSC. Software Adams/View and verified by an experimental measurement on a real-length testing rig. Analysis results prove the enhancement of devised traversing system, where the overall dynamic force is reduced considerably. At the same time, the precision of the <b>traversing</b> <b>movement</b> over the machine length is increased. This enables to increase machine operating speed while satisfying both the maximal tensile strength of the traversing rod and also output bobbin size standards. The usage of the developed mathematical model for determination of the optimal number and distribution of accumulators over the traversing rod of optional parameters is proved. The potential of the devised system for high-performance rotor spinning machines with longer traversing rod is also discussed...|$|E
50|$|The {{omission}} {{of a regular}} tank turret made for simpler and more cost-effective production, enabling greater numbers to be built. However {{the lack of a}} <b>traverse</b> <b>movement</b> in the gun meant the entire vehicle had to be turned left or right to acquire targets. Thus the StuG was more successful in defensive roles such as ambush, rather than as an offensive vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The chassis {{selected}} was {{a modified}} Type 97 Chi-Ha chassis. On to this platform, a Type 38 150 mm howitzer {{which was based}} on a design by the German arms-manufacturer Krupp was mounted, but dated from 1905 and had been withdrawn from service as being obsolete in 1942. The gun was capable of firing a 36 kilogram shell 6,000 meters. The gun crew was protected by a gun shield with armor thickness of 25 mm to the front, but was unprotected to the sides and rear, which made the design extremely vulnerable to close combat. Other issues with the design was that the gun had a <b>traverse</b> <b>movement</b> of only 3 degrees, and had a slow rate of fire due to its breech loader.|$|R

The components of motion of a star consist of the radial velocity toward or away from the Sun, and the <b>traverse</b> angular <b>movement,</b> which is called its proper motion.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{establish}} the potential of producing various hard metal industrial thick components using the High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) thermal spray process, rather than by sintering or casting techniques currently used. It is innovative in that generally research work earned out on this process focuses on coating technologies. In order to spray-form thick tungsten carbide cobalt (WC-Co) components, certain problems have to be overcome. More specifically these problems include minimizing residual stresses (which cause shape distortion in the components), therefore maintaining {{the integrity of the}} deposit on a microstructural scale. Residual stress arises during deposition and, in the present research, was reduced by limiting the rise and fluctuation of the deposition temperature. This was achieved by the utilization of a carbon dioxide cooling system and automated <b>traverse</b> <b>movement</b> of the spray gun, which together enabled continuous deposition at a steady temperature of 500 °C, reducing the residual stress by 58...|$|R
50|$|It was a {{conventional}} design, albeit with some unique characteristics. The carriage was {{mounted on a}} double-crank, curved axle which made it lower to the ground, reducing visibility and improving stability. The curved axle allowed the weapon to <b>traverse</b> without <b>movement</b> of the wheels, although traverse was still limited {{by the need to}} prevent the recoiling barrel from hitting the carriage. In addition the spade was pivot-mounted allowing the weapon to traverse without disturbing the spade. This movement of the carriage without moving the wheels or spade produced a very accurate weapon.|$|R
40|$|Currently {{there exists}} no {{generally}} accepted reference technique {{to measure the}} ventilation rate through naturally ventilated (NV) vents. This {{has an impact on}} the reliability of airflow rate control techniques and emission rate measurements in NV animal houses. As an attempt to address this issue a NV test facility was built to develop new airflow rate measurement techniques for both side wall and ridge vents. Three set-ups were used that differed in vent configuration, i. e. one cross ventilated set-up and two ridge ventilated set-ups with different vent sizes. The airflow through the side vents was measured with a technique based on an automatic <b>traverse</b> <b>movement</b> of a 3 D ultrasonic anemometer. In the ridge, 7 static 2 D ultrasonic anemometers were installed. The methods were validated by applying the air mass conservation principle, i. e. the inflow rates must equal the outflow rates. The calculated in - and outflow rates agreed within (5 +/- 8) %, (8 +/- 5) % and (- 9 +/- 7) % for the three different set-ups respectively, over a large range of wind incidence angles. It was found that the side vent configuration was of large importance for the distribution of the airflow rates through the vents. The ridge proved to be a constant outlet, whilst side vents could change from outlet to inlet depending on the wind incidence angle. The range of wind incidence angles in which this transition occurred could be clearly visualized...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a novel {{longitudinal}} {{tooth flank}} crowning method is proposed by setting the crossed angle between the hob cutter and work gear as a linear function of hob’s <b>traverse</b> feed <b>movement</b> in the gear hobbing process. However, this method makes twisted tooth flanks on the hobbed work gear. Therefore, a variable pressure angle hob cutter {{is applied to}} obtain an anti-twist tooth flank of hobbed work gear. A computer simulation example is performed to verify {{the superiority of the}} proposed novel hobbing method by comparing topographies of the crowned work gear surfaces hobbed by a standard hob cutter and a variable pressure angle hob cutter...|$|R
40|$|Gases {{produced}} in animal houses, such as NH 3 and CO 2, {{are not only}} harmful to the animals and farmers, but can also have negative effects on the environment. An optimum has to be found between maintaining a suitable indoor climate and preventing excessive emissions. For indoor climate control and especially emission measurements a reliable estimate of the airflow rate is essential. However, for naturally ventilated animal houses, no generally accepted reference technique exists to measure the airflow rate. Most existing techniques fail {{to account for the}} heterogeneous airflow patterns caused by the constantly changing external conditions of wind speed and direction. A new measuring method was developed through a stepwise approach starting from steady state measurements in wind tunnels up to measurements in a real size naturally ventilated test facility. This method, based on the automated <b>traverse</b> <b>movement</b> of a 3 D ultrasonic anemometer across a rectangular vent, delivered detailed velocity profiles from which the airflow rate could be calculated. It was proven that the method accounts for both the temporal and spatial variability of the velocity profiles which are characteristic of naturally ventilated openings. The relative measurement error between the total building inflow and outflow rates remained within the range of ± 20 %. Due to the extensiveness of the experiments under a large range of wind incidence angles and speeds, a unique reference testing platform was created. The in depth knowledge of the velocity profiles and the associated in- and outflow rates through each vent, create possibilities for the development, the calibration and the validation of new and existing airflow rate measurement techniques for natural ventilation...|$|R

A spraying distance of 200 mm and a powder feed rate of 38 gmm 1 exhibited the lowest stress within the deposit using the automated system. The minimization of the residual stress increased the maximum deposit thickness achieved from 0 6 mm to 1 2 mm. Higher deposit thicknesses were achieved when the deposition area was reduced. These findings were simulated by the finite element analysis technique The present research describes the successful production of 9 mm thick spray-formed WC-Co components (12 mm m diameter) Associative work in this thesis includes the fabricating of larger more complex shaped components, tensile specimens. The tensile specimens were used to measure the stiffness of the deposit (substrate free) and a Young’s modulus of 189 GPa was measured Post-heat treatment and measurement of Vicker’s hardness and porosity were also investigated. Finally, the economic feasibility of producing WC-Co cylindrical components using spray-forming is briefly discussed...|$|R
30|$|Also, as Fig.  5 depicts, {{welding with}} higher {{traverse}} speed reduces the tensile strength. This {{could be because}} of the fact that in higher <b>traverse</b> speed, faster <b>movement</b> of tool leads to poor mixing of the material. In other words, welding with smaller traverse speed allows the two sheets to get enough time for mixing and homogenization. Therefore, weld line deflection and deformation in samples with higher traverse speed lead to poor material mixing and consequently weak tensile strength.|$|R

60|$|The wary and calculating merchants {{accustomed}} {{to supply the}} army shrank from engaging at their own risk in so hazardous an undertaking. The queen therefore hired fourteen thousand beasts of burden, and ordered all the wheat and barley to be brought up in Andalusia and in the domains of the knights of Santiago and Calatrava. She entrusted the administration of these supplies to able and confidential persons. Some were employed to collect the grain; others {{to take it to}} the mills; others to superintend the grinding and delivery; and others to convey it to the camp. To every two hundred animals a muleteer was allotted to take charge of them on the route. Thus great lines of convoys were in constant <b>movement,</b> <b>traversing</b> to and fro, guarded by large bodies of troops to defend them from hovering parties of the Moors. Not a single day's intermission was allowed, for the army depended upon the constant arrival of the supplies for daily food. The grain when brought into the camp was deposited in an immense granary, and sold to the army at a fixed price, which was never either raised or lowered.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. -We used mark-recapture {{techniques}} {{to examine the}} effects of four types of road crossings on fish movement during spring base flows and summer low flows in small streams of the Ouachita Mountains, west-central Arkansas. We assessed movement for 21 fish species in seven families through culvert, slab, open-box, and ford crossings and through natural reaches. We detected no seasonal or directional bias in fish movement through any crossing type or the natural reaches. Overall fish movement was an order of magnitude lower through culverts than through other crossings or natural reaches, except no movement was detected through the slab crossing. In contrast, open-box and ford crossings showed little difference from natural reaches in overall movement of fishes. Numbers of species that <b>traversed</b> crossings and <b>movement</b> within three of four dominant fish families (Centrarchidae, Cyprinidae, and Fundulidae) also were reduced at culverts relative to ford and open-box crossings and natural reaches. In spring, retention of fishes was consistently highest in stream segments upstream of crossings and lowest in downstream segments for all crossing types, a response attributed to scouring associated with spring spates. Water velocity at crossings was inversely related to fish movement; culvert crossings consistently had the highest velocities and open-box crossings had the lowest. A key requirement for improvin...|$|R
40|$|Layout of the {{existing}} machines using cell system has been applied since 2005 and the machine operators have known the weaknesses, so {{it is necessary to}} improve the layout of the machines. This study was conducted to improve the machines layout cartridge case production by using Systematic Layout Planning and Blocplan with quantitative and qualitative considerations. The qualitative considerations are working ergonomies, while the quantitative considerations are the distance of product routing between one process with the next process and backtracking from product flow between workstations with another. A qualitative assessmen tends to be based on subjective considerations of each department facitity. Blocplan was the simple and practical method used in the settlement of this problem. Blocplan changed the layout by calculating the minimum total distance <b>traversed</b> in the <b>movement</b> of the materials between workstations. The application of Systematic Layout Planning methods and Blocplan in improving the layout and shortening production time in Hall OP decrease of product displacement distance is 26. 77 meters (13. 50 %) i. e. : before the improvement was 198. 36 meters, after improvement is 171. 59 meters.
