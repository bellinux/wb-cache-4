5|$|Mary Bignall-Rand– Gold {{medalist}} {{and world}} record breaker in <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>jump</b> at the 1964 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|For the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, two new multi-event {{disciplines}} were included, the pentathlon and the decathlon. A pentathlon, {{based on}} the ancient Greek event, had been introduced at the 1906 Intercalated Games. The 1912 version consisted of <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>jump,</b> javelin throw, 200-meter dash, discus throw and 1500-meter run.|$|E
5|$|His {{schedule}} in the Olympics was busy. Along with the decathlon and pentathlon, he competed in <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>jump</b> and high jump. The first competition was the pentathlon. He won {{four of the}} five events and placed third in the javelin, an event he had not competed in before 1912. Although the pentathlon was primarily decided on place points, points were also earned for the marks achieved in the individual events. He won the gold medal. That same day, he qualified for the high jump final in which he placed fourth, and also took seventh place in <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>jump.</b> Even more remarkably, because someone had stolen his shoes just before he was due to compete, he found some discarded ones in a rubbish bin and won his medals wearing them.|$|E
5000|$|... 20 February. This event debuted {{at these}} championships. Van {{is the first}} American woman to medal at the world championships. Sagen and Grassler tied for <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> <b>jump</b> in <b>the</b> first round while Van had <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> <b>jump</b> in <b>the</b> second round.|$|R

5|$|During high school, Munnerlyn {{was also}} a {{standout}} track & field sprinter. He competed in the 100-meter dash and long jump at the 2004 Junior Olympics. In 2006, he earned a second-place finish in <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>jump</b> event at the AHSAA State T Meet, recording a career-best leap of 6.85 meters (22ft, 4.75 in). He clocked personal-best times of 10.53 seconds in the 100-meter dash and 22.39 seconds in the 200-meter dash as a senior.|$|E
5|$|Hester {{was also}} a {{standout}} track athlete. While at Suncoast, he received All-America accolades, and he ranked second nationally in <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>jump</b> as a junior. He also captured the 2004 Big EAST Indoor long jump title {{as a member of}} the University of Miami track and field team, with a leap of 7.37 meters. He also competed in the 60 meters and 100 meters, posting personal bests of 6.77 seconds and 10.62, 10.42W seconds, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Buffalo {{track and}} field program has had several successes {{throughout}} its history. The Buffaloes won the state championship in 1945 and 1946, but in more recent years results have been variable. In 2003, Eric Babb won <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>jump</b> state title {{for the first time}} in the school's history. The track & field program finished runner-up in the 2006 state championship, falling to Lawrence High School by 1/2 of a point. Garden City has also produced several notable athletes, including 1995 Kansas Track and Field Gatorade Athlete of the Year, high-jumper Jason Archibald.|$|E
50|$|In the jumping events, Iris Pruysen of the Netherlands won <b>the</b> T44 <b>long</b> <b>jump,</b> her country's {{first in}} Lyon, Nikol Rodomakina (Russia) {{recorded}} a personal best to win <b>the</b> T46 <b>long</b> <b>jump</b> and another gold {{went to the}} Ukraine as Dmytro Prudinkov took <b>the</b> T20 <b>long</b> <b>jump</b> title.|$|R

5|$|Ward was the Michigan High School Athlete of the Year, {{after setting}} a {{national}} prep {{record in the}} high jump. At the University of Michigan, he was a collegiate champion in the high jump, <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>jump,</b> the 100-yard dash, and the 440-yard dash, and {{finished second in the}} voting for the Associated Press Big Ten Athlete of the Year award in 1933. In track and field he was a three-time All-American and eight-time Big Ten champion.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} the stadium {{combines}} a number of elements {{for use in the}} jumping and throwing events. <b>The</b> <b>long</b> <b>jump</b> and triple jump areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board—typically a small strip of wood with a plasticine marker attached—which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The pole vault area is also a 40-metre running track and has an indentation in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto cushioned landing mats. The high jump is a stripped down version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it.|$|E
5|$|The {{sport of}} {{track and field}} {{has its roots in}} human prehistory. Track and field-style events are among the oldest of all {{sporting}} competitions, as running, jumping and throwing are natural and universal forms of human physical expression. The first recorded examples of organized track and field events at a sports festival are the Ancient Olympic Games. At the first Games in 776 BC in Olympia, Greece, only one event was contested: the stadion footrace. The scope of the Games expanded in later years to include further running competitions, but the introduction of the Ancient Olympic pentathlon marked a step towards track and field as it is recognized today—it comprised a five-event competition of <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>jump,</b> javelin throw, discus throw, stadion footrace, and wrestling.|$|E
50|$|Schlierenzauer had <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> <b>jump</b> of <b>the</b> {{competition}} with his 231.0 m final round jump.|$|R

5|$|Blount {{was born}} December 5, 1986, in Madison, Florida, to Gary and Barbara Blount. He has one brother and one sister. Blount is the great-nephew of avant-garde jazz {{musician}} Sun Ra (born Herman Blount). He attended Taylor County High School {{in the small}} town of Perry, Florida, where he was a two-sport star in both football and track & field. In high school football, he was a four-year starter and three-time 1,000-yard rusher. He first reached the milestone as a sophomore and equaled the feat the following season despite playing with a thigh bruise for most of the year. He accorded second-team All-state player honors as a prep senior. In track & field, Blount competed in events such as the 100-meter dash (11.34 s), <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>jump</b> (22-1 or 6.75m), and the shot put (53-2 or 16.22m). He was also a member of the 4 × 100 m squad.|$|E
5|$|The FSU men's Track & Field {{team won}} the Atlantic Coast Conference {{championship}} four times running, in addition to winning the NCAA National Championship three consecutive years. In 2006 Head Coach Bob Braman and Associate Head Coach Harlis Meaders helped lead individual champions in the 200 m (Walter Dix), the triple jump (Raqeef Curry), and the shot put (Garrett Johnson). Individual runners-up were Walter Dix in the 100 m, Ricardo Chambers in the 400 m, and Tom Lancashire in the 1500 m. Others scoring points in the National Championship were Michael Ray Garvin in the 200 m (8th), Andrew Lemoncello in the 3000 m steeplechase (4th), Raqeef Curry in <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>jump</b> (6th), and Garrett Johnson in the discus (5th). In 2007, FSU won its second straight men's Track & Field NCAA National Championship when Dix became {{the first person to}} hold the individual title in the 100 m, 200 m, and 400 m at the same time.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>long</b> <b>jump</b> {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} track and field events, having its roots as one of the events within the ancient Greek pentathlon contest. The athletes would take a short run up and jump into an area of dug up earth, with the winner being the one who jumped farthest. Small weights (Halteres) were held in each hand during the jump then swung back and dropped near the end to gain extra {{momentum}} and distance. The modern long jump, standardised in England and the United States around 1860, bears resemblance to the ancient event although no weights are used. Athletes sprint along a length of track that leads to a jumping board and a sandpit. The athletes must jump before a marked line and their achieved distance is measured from the nearest point of sand disturbed by the athlete's body.|$|E
50|$|Noriaki Kasai, {{who failed}} {{to qualify for the}} first round, {{finished}} third after making <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> <b>jump</b> in <b>the</b> competition.|$|R
50|$|Schlierenzauer had <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> <b>jumps</b> in both rounds, {{with the}} second round leap of 142 metres just 1.5 metres short of the hill record.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>longest</b> <b>jump</b> Knievel {{made over}} cars was 129 feet over 19 cars in 1971 and was {{featured}} in the movie Evel Knievel starring George Hamilton. [...] <b>The</b> <b>longest</b> <b>jump</b> over buses was first attempted with Knievel crashing at Wembley Stadium in 1975 {{in an attempt to}} jump 120 feet over 13 buses. Five months later, Knievel jumped the XR-750 over 14 buses for his personal record, and world record for almost 25 years, of 133 feet at Kings Island.|$|R
5|$|The {{son of a}} {{track and}} field coach, Walter Dix competed at {{athletics}} meetings from a young age, specialising in sprinting and <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>jump.</b> His speed also translated well to the football field, and he often played the sport at school. Dix was an accomplished high school runner: in his final year at Coral Springs High School in 2004 he recorded 10.28seconds in the 100 meters, then third all-time on the Florida high school record list behind only Houston McTear and Curtis Johnson, and broke the 200 meters Florida high school record with 20.62seconds. Aside from J-Mee Samuels' 10.28seconds in the 100m, these were the two fastest marks by a high school athlete that year. Both these times were within the Olympic standard for the events. He competed at the US Olympic Trials in the 200m, but did not progress beyond the heats stage.|$|E
5|$|Once {{he began}} to play football, as a junior, he {{achieved}} instant success as a running back, running 65 {{yards for a touchdown}} on his first high school carry. At , he was not especially large, but his speed and strength {{made him one of the}} team's featured players. John J. Jefferson High School was integrated with neighboring Columbia High School that year; Payton and his teammates were upset that their head coach, Charles L. Boston, had become an assistant and Payton boycotted some of the spring practices in protest, but returned during the fall season. He then earned statewide honors as a member of Mississippi's all-state team, leading Columbia to an unexpected 8–2 season. His performance helped ease the local tensions surrounding desegregation. Tommy Davis, Columbia’s football coach, claimed that he could always count on Payton when the team needed to score. Payton’s statistics proved that was no exaggeration: he scored in every game during his junior and senior years. He was named to the all-conference team two years in a row. Payton also led the Little Dixie Conference in scoring his senior year and made the all-state team. In addition to excelling at football, Payton averaged 18 points a game for Columbia’s basketball team, leaped three-quarters of an inch short of 23 feet in <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>jump,</b> played baseball, and continued to drum in the school band.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} Egyptians, {{all of whom}} qualified {{through the}} B standard, competed in field events. Omar Ahmed El Ghazaly, in the discus, was the most experienced of the quartet, with senior international medals going back to bronze at the 2002 African Championships in Athletics, in addition to past Olympic appearances in 2004 and 2008. In London he finished 26th among 41 participants with a best throw of 60.26 meters. Ihab Abdelrahman, in the javelin throw, had missed the 2008 Summer Olympics, despite having been a silver medalist at the 2007 Pan Arab Games, but had won the event at the 2010 African Championships and the 2011 Pan Arab Games. In London he placed 28th out of 44 competitors with a best throw of 77.35 meters. Mostafa Al-Gamel, in the hammer throw, was the gold medalist from the 2011 All-African Games and a silver medalist from the 2008 African Championships and the 2011 Pan Arab Games. In London he was 27th among 41 participants with a best throw of 71.36 meters. Mohamed Fathalla Difallah, who had come in fourth at the 2011 All-Africa Games, was 37th out of 41 competitors in the qualifying round of <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>jump</b> in London, with a distance of 7.08 meters, and did not advance to the final.|$|E
