25|$|In December 1967, Cetera arrived {{early for}} a show to watch a band called <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Thing.</b> Impressed by their use of a horn section {{combined}} with rock and roll, Cetera left The Exceptions to join <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Thing</b> within two weeks. <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Thing,</b> which soon changed their name to The Chicago Transit Authority (and eventually shortened it to Chicago) released their self-titled debut album The Chicago Transit Authority on Columbia Records in 1969. Cetera shared lead vocal on three of the eleven songs on the album, with his tenor voice complementing the baritone voices of the two other lead singers in the group, keyboardist Robert Lamm and guitarist Terry Kath.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Kath {{joined a}} cover band called the Missing Links, taking Parazaider and Seraphine with him, and started playing clubs and ballrooms in Chicago {{on a regular}} basis. Parazaider's friend at De Paul University, trumpeter Lee Loughnane, also sat in with the band from time to time. Kath's compatriot, James William Guercio (who later became Chicago's producer) was lead guitarist {{in one of two}} road bands {{performing}} on The Dick Clark Show with the Missing Links. Kath received an offer from Guercio to play bass for the Illinois Speed Press and move to Los Angeles, but declined as he considered the guitar his main instrument and wanted to sing lead. He stayed with Parazaider, Seraphine, and Loughnane instead, who quickly recruited trombonist James Pankow from De Paul and vocalist/keyboardist Robert Lamm. Kath sang the lower range of lead vocals in the group in a style reminiscent of Ray Charles. The group practiced at Parazaider's parents' basement and changed its name to <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Thing.</b> With the addition of singer and bassist Peter Cetera of The Exceptions, they moved to Los Angeles and signed with Columbia Records, renaming the band Chicago Transit Authority. In mid-1969, the name was shortened to Chicago.|$|E

They've just changed {{something}} important in their lives forever." [...] When asked if O'Malley was becoming more assertive, Knight said: [...] Knight also commented that the character does not appreciate himself and his positive traits. On the topic of O'Malley performing open heart surgery in an elevator, Knight said: [...] "It's a slow change but he's starting to realize, 'The way I have been doing things is not working.' <b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>thing</b> about the open-heart surgery in the elevator was he was forced into it. He needs to be kind of kicked in the (butt) to do these things." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1958 he {{was second}} {{in the league in}} both wins (17) and ERA (2.68); his seventh two-hitter, a 1–0 win on June 21 against the Baltimore Orioles in which the White Sox scored only an unearned run in the first inning, was {{followed}} by the greatest game of his career. On June 27 against the Senators, he retired the first 26 batters before pinch hitter Ed Fitz Gerald lined Pierce's first pitch down the first base line for an opposite-field double that landed about a foot from the foul line. Pierce then struck out Albie Pearson on three pitches to end the game; only twice did he go to a three-ball count. The lone hit marred what would have been a remarkable accomplishment; not only had no left-hander pitched a perfect game since Lee Richmond in 1880, but only one AL left-hander (Mel Parnell in 1956) pitched even a no-hitter between 1931 and 1962. Although disappointed by the near miss, Pierce praised his teammates for their defensive work, saying, [...] "Give Luis plenty of credit. And Sherm really mixed 'em up beautifully. <b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>thing</b> is that we won." [...] At a Capitol lunch with several White Sox players during the following year's pennant race, Vice President Richard Nixon told Pierce that he had watched the game on television, saying, [...] "I'm a Washington fan, but that was one night I was rooting for the White Sox." [...] In a 1982 interview, Pierce said, [...] "The book on Fitz Gerald was that he was a fastball hitter on the first ball and liked it inside where he could pull it. So we threw him a curve away and he hit into right for a solid hit. I didn't feel that badly about it, really. It didn't mean that much at the moment. But now ... well, now I wish I had got it. It would have been nice." [...] His streak of 33 consecutive scoreless innings was ended with an unearned run in the seventh inning on July 1.|$|E

Lord's was my home ground there for Middlesex and I played at The Oval as well and Edgbaston. It couldn't have really worked out any better. <b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>thing</b> was just going over there to experience the whole different culture really, the weather, the wickets and the bowlers as well." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cecil {{believes}} that game design involves a different creative process {{as compared to}} traditional writing. As a writer of a linear story, [...] "all they do is to write the script," [...] he said. [...] "In game design, the writer should think about the gameplay and background story first before developing any of the characters. However, the constraints of an interactive medium {{is no excuse for}} a poorly constructed story, <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>thing</b> {{is that we have a}} different medium. We have to accept that we have not only huge advantages in the interactive medium but also big constraints. And these constraints often lead to some really shitty stories. And that’s why so many games have bad stories." ...|$|E
2500|$|While gaining {{some success}} as a cover band, the group began working on {{original}} songs. In June 1968, at manager James William Guercio's request, <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Thing</b> moved to Los Angeles, California, and signed with Columbia Records. The band {{changed its name to}} [...] "Chicago Transit Authority". It was while performing on a regular basis at the Whisky a Go Go nightclub in West Hollywood that the band got exposure to more famous musical artists of the time. Subsequently, they were the opening act for Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. As related to group biographer, William James Ruhlmann, by Walt Parazaider, Jimi Hendrix once told Parazaider, Jeez, your horn players are like one set of lungs and your guitar player is better than me.|$|E

2500|$|Kath used several guitars in {{his early}} career, but several were stolen while on the road. His first main {{instrument}} that he used when Chicago were still <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Thing</b> was a Register guitar that cost $80. When the band started becoming successful, he traded up to a Fender Stratocaster. He also used a Gibson SG, as pictured on Chicago Transit Authoritys inner sleeve, {{and was one of}} the few well-known guitarists to make regular use of the 1969 Les Paul [...] "Professional" [...] model, which sported a pair of unconventional low-impedance pickups with a special impedance-matching transformer for use with a standard high impedance-input amplifier. Kath tended to favor light strings, though for the top E string, he used one from a tenor guitar.|$|E

It was composed of three tracks, including the Steve Perry song [...] "Foolish Heart", [...] "Breathe Again" [...] and [...] "Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)", recorded in a home studio with only a guitar for accompaniment. Her brother King brought her demo to different recording labels. Ricky Ilacad, who was managing director of Warner Music Philippines at that time, heard the demo and immediately wanted to sign her up even without seeing or hearing her in person. Two months after her father died of a heart attack in the U.S., she signed her first recording contract with Warner.|$|E

Well, he had failed, was his secret decision. Perhaps the editors were right. He had felt <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>thing,</b> but he had failed to transmute it.
