5|$|The Mariners traded Pineda to the New York Yankees with José Campos, for Jesús Montero and Héctor Noesí on January 13, 2012. The Yankees {{needed a}} top-tier {{starting}} pitcher to pair with CC Sabathia, and the Mariners felt <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> part with Pineda {{because of their}} depth of top-tier pitching prospects, including Danny Hultzen, James Paxton, and Taijuan Walker.|$|E
5|$|The size of Chnodomar's cavalry is unknown, but was {{probably}} {{a small proportion of}} the total, as the Alamanni's heavily forested land was not suited to large-scale cavalry operations. Most of the Alamanni horsemen were noblemen and their retainers, as only <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> keep a warhorse. Chnodomar's cavalry is unlikely to have exceeded 1,750 horse in total, assuming that the cavalry element was similar to the 7% cavalry element in the early Roman citizen legion, as the latter was also recruited exclusively from the wealthiest classes.|$|E
5|$|In this period, it {{was common}} for {{aspiring}} Australian artists to seek further training in Europe, particularly London and Paris. Henry Rix arranged to take his family there {{in conjunction with a}} trip he was making to study British education reforms, purchasing first-class tickets to travel in 1906. But Henry, who had been overworked and ill, died suddenly, and for a time it appeared the trip might not happen. Denied a widow's pension (Henry had been 58: too young for his wife to be eligible), the family had to reorganise their affairs and work out if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> get to Europe. Finally, by combining an inheritance, rental income from their home, and money raised through the sale of works by both mother and daughter, they were able to trade the first class tickets for second class berths, and they set sail for England early in 1907.|$|E

5|$|With the {{breakthrough}} of third wave ska into the American mainstream by late 1996, the Daddies seemed poised for commercial success, landing {{a spot on}} a well-publicized national tour with popular ska bands Reel Big Fish and Let's Go Bowling. Although the band were mainly playing ska shows at the time, they soon began drawing a sizable following for their swing material when the coincident success of the film Swingers and its featured band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy started drawing public and media attention towards the formerly underground swing revival movement. When fans regularly began approaching the band's merchandise table asking which of their albums contained the most swing, the Daddies realized they lacked an album fully representing their swing side, prompting the band's manager to convince them to compile all of their swing songs onto one CD until <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> make a new album, using their available finances to record several bonus tracks for inclusion. The result, , became an unexpectedly popular item as the band went on tour, reportedly selling as many as 4,000 copies a week through their Northwest distributors.|$|E
25|$|Far more {{numerous}} were Chinese immigrant workers, known as sangley, as many Chinese historically had been traders.

25|$|Robert King High {{was born}} in 1924 in Flat Creek, Tennessee, where {{his father was a}} {{carpenter}} and farmer. With the coming of the Great Depression, the High family moved to the city of Chattanooga. High began working early, delivering newspapers at the age of five, and buying a lawn mower on credit at age ten; he paid for it by mowing lawns and delivering groceries and milk. He later worked as a soda jerk. He organized a band; the members played in their ROTC uniforms until <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> buy tuxedos.|$|E

25|$|Miller and Lux {{were not}} any newer to the San Joaquin Valley {{than had been}} Haggin, but were the driving {{influence}} on valley agribusiness {{until well into the}} early 20th century. The corporation had begun acquiring land in the valley in 1858, eventually holding sway over an enormous swath reaching from the Kern River in the south to the Chowchilla River in the north. Much of the land that Miller and Lux acquired was swamp and marsh, which was considered virtually worthless. However, with their huge capital, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> drain thousands of acres of it, beginning an enormous environmental change that eventually resulted in the loss of over 95 percent of the wetlands adjoining the San Joaquin River and Tulare Basin.|$|E
25|$|After {{a failed}} attempt with Jeff Green {{to qualify for}} the 1999 Daytona 500, Moore was {{approached}} by a California family, Robert, Sue, and Randy Fenley, who were operating a successful NASCAR West Coast team and wanted to expand into Cup. Moore sold the operation to them but remained on board as a consultant. They attempted their first race at that year's Brickyard 400 as the No. 62 with Big Daddy's BBQ Sauce as sponsor. Jeff Davis and Lance Hooper shared the driving duties, but they did not qualify for the race. Nevertheless, the team began preparing for 2000. Late in the year, the team announced they would hire Derrike Cope would drive the No. 15 until the end of 2001. Although no sponsor was named, the team assured Cope that there was enough financial stability for him to run for the entirety of his contract. Cope qualified at Lowe's Motor Speedway for the team in 1999, finishing 35th. Things looked promising for 2000, as Cope had a strong Speedweeks. However, the team soon started to skip races because of financial difficulties. Things went from bad to worse as Moore left the team. Soon afterwards, Cope quit the team in disgust because he felt that he was lied to when he was told the organization was financially secure. Ted Musgrave drove at Talladega and finished 35th. After that, the team moved to North Carolina and hoped to run the ARCA series until <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> compete in NASCAR again. That never came to be and the team soon shut down and sold its equipment. Moore's old shop in Spartanburg was purchased recently by Converse College as a storage facility.|$|E
500|$|Eddy {{continued}} {{to revise the}} book until her death in 1910. In 1902 she added a chapter, [...] "Fruitage," [...] recounting healing testimonies from the Christian Science Journal and Christian Science Sentinel. There were over 400 editions (the final ran to 18 chapters and 600 pages), seven of them major revisions, according to Gottschalk, and members were encouraged to buy them all. Other income derived {{from the sale of}} rings and brooches, pictures of Eddy, and in 1889 the Mary Baker Eddy souvenir spoon; Eddy asked every Christian Scientist to buy at least one, or a dozen if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to.</b> When the copyright on Science and Health expired in 1971, the church persuaded Congress to extend it to 2046. The bill was supported by two of President Richard Nixon's aides, Christian Scientists H. R. Haldeman [...] and John Ehrlichman. The law was overturned as unconstitutional in 1987, after a challenge by United Christian Scientists, an independent group. By 2001 Science and Health had sold over nine million copies.|$|E

2500|$|Elvis Presley {{had long}} harbored {{a love for}} gospel and Jake Hess in particular. The group {{recorded}} with Elvis in sessions from May 1966 to June 1971. This included his last two Grammy Award-producing albums: How Great Thou Art (which won a Grammy for the title song and featured a duet with Hess on the classic Statesmen song [...] "If the Lord Wasn't Walking By My Side") and He Touched Me (which used many of the songs that The Imperials had recorded on their own albums and, again, won a Grammy for the title song). In 1969, Elvis hired the group to perform in concert with him after the Jordanaires had turned down Elvis' invitation to play Las Vegas and tour because, as studio singers, they did not feel <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> be away from Nashville that much. At {{the same time the}} Imperials appeared with Jimmy Dean, live and on his television show. In November 1971, because of scheduling conflicts, they decided to stop performing with Elvis. The following year the group quit performing in concert with Jimmy Dean.|$|E
