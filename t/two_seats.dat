5|$|The {{amount of}} {{municipal}} seats was expanded to 13 during the Palestinian municipal elections in 2005. A local group, the Bani Na'im Martyrs list, won the most seats: five. The Al-Aqsa list won three seats, Independent lists also won three and the Hamas-backed Reform and Change list won the remaining <b>two</b> <b>seats.</b> Gender-wise, females won <b>two</b> <b>seats</b> and males eleven. Issa Hassan al-Khdour, {{member of the}} Bani Na'im Martyrs, had the most votes (3,281), and thus became {{the head of the}} municipality.

5|$|Ohio statewide {{offices are}} {{regularly}} contested {{every four years}} in the midterm election years. 2008 is Class 2 senatorial election year, and Ohio is a state with class 1 and class 3 senators. Thus, the Attorney General race was the only non-presidential race in the 2008 election aside from contests for <b>two</b> <b>seats</b> on the Ohio Supreme Court. Cordray defeated Republican Mike Crites, 57%-38%.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneously, the African Group {{started to}} demand two {{permanent}} seats for themselves, {{on the basis}} of historical injustices and because much of the Council's agenda is concentrated in that continent. Those <b>two</b> <b>seats</b> would be permanent African seats, that would rotate between African countries chosen by the African group.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{instigator}} for {{the creation}} of the LM in 1972 had been based around the lack of electoral reform. The electoral system had been expected to continue to return rural LCL members in the Legislative Council, yet at the 1973 state election Labor had, through the mass registration of new voters for the council vote, managed to gain <b>two</b> <b>seats,</b> giving a 14–6 split in the council. As half the council was elected at each election, Labor only had to retain their vote to gain an additional <b>two</b> <b>seats</b> at the 1975 state election, and a minor rise in it would see additional council seats fall to them. It was increasingly plausible that Labor would be able to gain a majority in the Legislative Council within a decade and then carry through their goal of abolishing it, and push through any electoral legislation it so wished.|$|E

5|$|The {{race was}} never close, and the Nixon/Agnew ticket won 49 states and over 60 {{percent of the}} vote in gaining re-election. Trying to {{position}} himself as the frontrunner for 1976, Agnew campaigned widely for Republican candidates, something Nixon would not do. Despite Agnew's efforts, Democrats easily held both houses of Congress, gaining <b>two</b> <b>seats</b> in the Senate, though the Republicans gained twelve in the House.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 273 {{disputes}} were {{brought before the}} Constitutional Court, the last of which were decided on 21 June. Of these cases, 38 decisions affected the final allocation of seats in the People's Representative Council and provincial and regental legislatures. The Democratic Party lost <b>two</b> <b>seats,</b> one to the National Mandate Party and Prosperous Peace Party each. The Pioneers' Party gained one seat from the United Democratic Nationhood Party. Meanwhile, the only seat allocated to the Freedom Bull National Party by the General Election Commission was reassigned to the Reform Star Party.|$|E
5|$|By 1972, Diefenbaker {{had grown}} disillusioned with Trudeau, and campaigned wholeheartedly for the Tories in that year's election. Diefenbaker was reelected comfortably {{in his home}} riding, and the Progressive Conservatives came within <b>two</b> <b>seats</b> of {{matching}} the Liberal total. Diefenbaker was relieved both that Trudeau had been humbled and that Stanfield had been denied power. Trudeau regained his majority two years later in an election that saw Diefenbaker, by then the only living former Prime Minister, have his personal majority grow to 11,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|Crittenden {{was drawn}} back into public service by the Old Court – New Court controversy. When {{legislation}} aimed at providing {{relief to the}} state's debtors was struck down by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, supporters of the legislation in the General Assembly passed a bill abolishing the Court and creating a new court, which they stocked with sympathetic justices. Opponents of the legislation held that the Assembly's action was unconstitutional, and for a time, both courts claimed authority as the court of last resort in the state. Though he had {{served as president of}} the New Court-backed Bank of the Commonwealth since its formation in 1820, Crittenden publicly identified himself with the Old Court supporters in April 1825. In the legislative election of 1825, friends called on Crittenden to seek election to the state House of Representatives. Many believed that he was the only Old Court supporter that commanded enough respect to win one of the <b>two</b> <b>seats</b> allotted to Franklin County, a bastion of the New Court. When Crittenden consented to run, New Court supporters nominated the state's Attorney General Solomon P. Sharp and Lewis Sanders, a prominent lawyer. Crittenden and Sharp were elected to the <b>two</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 1809 {{election}} for Hampshire County's <b>two</b> <b>seats</b> in the Virginia House of Delegates, White ran against fellow Federalist Alexander King, and Democratic-Republicans William Donaldson and Jonathan Pugh. King {{received the most}} votes at 312, and White came in second with 288 votes, thus qualifying him for a seat. White ran for reelection in 1811 against Alexander King, William Armstrong, and Jonathan Pugh. White and King received the two highest vote totals, with White receiving 313 votes. White was reelected to his seat in 1812, with 336 votes.|$|E
5|$|Finding the {{financial}} demands of his Maidstone seat too much, Disraeli secured a Tory nomination for Shrewsbury, winning {{one of the}} constituency's <b>two</b> <b>seats</b> at the 1841 general election, despite serious opposition, and heavy debts which opponents seized on. The election was a massive defeat for the Whigs across the country, and Peel became Prime Minister. Disraeli hoped, unrealistically, for ministerial office. Though disappointed at being left on the back benches, he continued his support for Peel in 1842 and 1843, seeking to establish himself as an expert on foreign affairs and international trade.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Boeing {{introduced}} overhead crew rests as {{an option}} on the 777. Located above the main cabin and connected via staircases, the forward flight crew rest contains <b>two</b> <b>seats</b> and two bunks, while the aft cabin crew rest features multiple bunks. The Signature Interior has since been adapted for other Boeing wide-body and narrow-body aircraft, including 737NG, 747-400, 757-300, and newer 767 models, including all 767-400ER models. The 747-8 and 767-400ER have also adopted the larger, more rounded windows of the original 777.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} {{election}} campaign in 1984, BSP fielded Mayawati for the Lok Sabha (Lower House) seat of Kairana in the Muzaffarnagar district, for Bijnor in 1985, and for Haridwar in 1987. In 1989 she was elected as the representative for Bijnor, with 183,189 votes, winning by 8,879 votes. Although BSP {{did not win}} control of the house, the electoral experience led to considerable activity for Mayawati {{over the next five}} years, as she worked with Mahsood Ahmed and other organisers. The party won three seats in the 1989 national election and <b>two</b> <b>seats</b> 1991.|$|E
5|$|In the 2005 civic election, he {{was again}} elected, though his Richmond First party only won {{three of the}} eight seats.

With not even his own party members {{supporting}} him for the Metro Vancouver seat and finding himself being alone {{in a number of}} issues, such as supporting the SkyTrain line being elevated, opposing the tree preservation bylaw, and wanting to hire more police officers, Howard left the Richmond First party in February 2006 to be an independent.|$|E
