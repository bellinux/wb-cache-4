50|$|Depending on the situation, {{polyelectrolytes}} {{can function}} as either flocculants or deflocculants. In order to stabilize emulsion, deflocculant polyelectrolytes are required. When repulsive forces between particles overcome the intermolecular forces in solution and the loose flocculated aggregates separate, deflocculation occurs. As {{opposed to the}} loose and easily separated sediments formed in flocculation, sediments formed in deflocculation are tightly packed and difficult to redisperse.The repelling forces in a deflocculation increase the zeta potential, which in turn reduces the viscosity of the suspension. Because of this reduction in viscosity, deflocculants are {{sometimes referred to as}} “thinning agents”. These <b>thinning</b> <b>agents</b> are usually alkaline and raise the pH of the suspension, preventing flocculation.

30|$|Fundamentally, CO 2 -EOR {{operates}} {{in a simple}} manner. Given the right conditions, CO 2 mixes with crude oil (or mixture crude + gas) behaving like a <b>thinning</b> <b>agent.</b> The oil viscosity is, thereby, reduced and flushed out from oil reservoir by the means of water (Donaldson et al. 1989). In typical oil reservoir, {{it is common to}} find water that coexists with trapped crudes in the form of brine (or connate water). Brine, which consists mainly of sodium chloride (NaCl), has a concentration reported much higher to than of typical seawater. Often, it ranges from 1 to 30 wt% NaCl (Tarek 2007). During gas injection, the gas comes in contact with reservoir fluid(s) distributing immiscible fluids into distinct thermodynamic phases including gas rich, hydrocarbon rich, and water rich. Because of the complex chemical composition of the crude oil, the phase distribution computation is reported laborious. Thus, it is acceptable to model crude oil as a single component. Rather to singularize crude oil as a pseudo-component, this work has computed thermodynamic phase composition using crude oil modeled from its actual chemical composition.|$|E

Simultaneously, the microstructure of polyurethane concrete and their adhesive situation bewteen waste cement blocks were observed through scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results show that the flexural strength of the specimen for two hours can reach to 6. 67 MPa, and the compressive strength can reach to 9. 15 MPa, which can achieve the rapid pavement repair on highway in two hours, and it is superior to the related Chinese Standard.

40|$|Benzyladenine (BA) is a {{well known}} {{synthetic}} cytokinin broadly used as a <b>thinning</b> <b>agent</b> in apple orchards.

The results confirm the bimodal action of BA through ethylene, acting first on shoot growth and then, most likely indirectly, promoting fruitlet abscission. Based on a 24 hours-resolution time-course, a very fast action of BA was observed within 24 h from the treatment. A parallel antagonist effect was exerted by AVG within 24 - 48 h.

40|$|Elstar’, {{the main}} apple {{cultivar}} {{grown in the}} Netherlands, requires adequate thinning to reach marketable fruit sizes and to achieve regular yields by preventing alternate bearing. At the moment, chemical thinning of ‘Elstar’ is the only economically feasible way of thinning. Thinning by hand is labour intensive and thus too expensive. Furthermore, hand thinning is usually carried out after June-drop, by which time only increases in fruit size are achieved and no reduction in alternate bearing. Up to 2004, carbaryl was the only effective fruit-thinning chemical Dutch growers had at their disposal. However, carbaryl is no longer officially registered for thinning apples. Thus, another agent for thinning ‘Elstar’ and other apple cultivars is urgently needed. This paper reports on two trials made with the <b>thinning</b> <b>agent</b> MaxCel containing 6 -benzyladenine (BA) as the active ingredient. Generally, MaxCel applied at 10 - 12 mm fruit diameter thinned well, yielded bigger fruits and improved return bloom. However, thinning efficacy of MaxCel was negligible for weak growing trees or branches and increased with the vigour of the tree or branch.

Many of these cardiac patients are also on anithrombotic therapy like warfarin. Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) is the main adverse event of this treatment. Aims: The main {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze the relationship of dual anti-Plt therapy and the risk of LGIB. Methods: Patients' electronic charts were reviewed to include a total of 19 variables, which included age, sex, ethnicity, daily use aspirin of any dose, daily use of clopidogrel, use of nonsteroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at least twice in the last week prior to admission and the daily use of anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin), and were obtained from history and physical examination reports, lab transcripts and procedural reports. Settings/Design: A retrospective cohort study of the records of 3436 patients admitted to our hospital from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2011, was evaluated. All the patients included were admitted through the emergency department with complaints of or relating to LGIB. The primary outcome studied was severe LGIB as defined by the requirement of at least two units of packed red blood cells and/or a decrease in the hematocrit of 20 % or more or recurrent bleeding after 24 h of clinical stability with additional transfusions required. Other outcomes included surgical intervention. Statistical Methods/Analysis: Univariate analysis using t-test on continuous variables and Chi-square test on categorical variables were done before carrying out logistic regression analysis. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to measures of association between the variables and LGIB. Logistic regression analysis was not carried for surgical intervention and death because none of the variables was significant from univariate tests. Results: A total of 511 patients were found to have true LGIB. Among these subjects, 61 were shown to be on dual or multiple antithrombotic therapies. Further exploration revealed that while the use of multiple blood <b>thinning</b> <b>agents</b> may, in fact, pose a significant risk to overall LGIB, it did not significantly increase the risk for severe bleeding as outlined above.
