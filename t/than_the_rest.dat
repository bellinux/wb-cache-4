30|$|For depolarization-activated channels, V 1 / 2 is more {{positive}} <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> ∆ΨM; for hyperpolarization-activated channels, V 1 / 2 is more negative <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> ∆ΨM. Because of the linear relationship between ∆G 0 and V 1 / 2, any cellular factors that modulate ∆G 0 will affect V 1 / 2 too. For example, cAMP binding to the cytosolic {{domain of the}} hyperpolarization-activated HCN channel shifts V 1 / 2 to {{more positive}} values, thus easier to open the channel (Stieber et al. 2003).|$|R

5|$|An angular {{unconformity}} truncates progressively older (lower) {{parts of the}} underlying Pahrump Group starting {{in the southern part}} of the area and moving north. At its northernmost extent, the unconformity in fact removed all of the Pahrump, and the Noonday rests directly on the Proterozoic Complex. An ancient period of erosion removed that part of the Pahrump due to its being higher (and thus more exposed) <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the formation.|$|E

50|$|The {{process of}} repolarization causes an {{overshoot}} in {{the potential of}} the cell. Potassium ions continue {{to move out of the}} axon so much so that <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential is exceeded and the new cell potential becomes more negative <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential. <b>The</b> <b>resting</b> potential is ultimately re-established by the closing of all voltage-gated ion channels and the activity of the sodium potassium ion pump.|$|R
50|$|Repolarization {{typically}} {{results from}} the movement of positively charged K+ ions out of the cell. The repolarization phase of an action potential initially results in hyperpolarization, attainment of a membrane potential, termed the afterhyperpolarization, that is more negative <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential. Repolarization usually takes several milliseconds.|$|R

5|$|Eye {{irritation}} can {{be avoided}} by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water. Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the bulb. Refrigerating the onions before use reduces the enzyme reaction rate and using a fan can blow the gas away from the eyes. The more often one chops onions, the less one experiences eye irritation.|$|E

50|$|The {{potassium}} channels {{exhibit a}} delayed {{reaction to the}} membrane repolarisation, and, even after <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential is achieved, some potassium continues to flow out, resulting in an intracellular fluid that is more negative <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential, and during which no action potential can begin (undershoot phase/refractory period). This undershoot phase ensures that the action potential propagates down the axon and not back up it.|$|R

5|$|In {{southern}} India, they moult their feathers from June to October. The wing moult {{begins in}} July {{with the first}} primary and proceeds towards the tenth.

The secondary moult is not orderly, the 8th and 7th being dropped earlier <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest.</b> The tail feathers are moulted centrifugally. Seasonal colour changes in the testicular tissues are caused by variation in melanin synthesis, with the dark pigmentation being lost during the breeding season.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The sucrose {{response}} in mouse taste cells {{has been investigated}} further using intracellular recording and dye marking techniques. Only responses recorded from taste buds with fluorescent cells, as observed in subsequent histological preparations, were used in this study. Taste cells could be classified into two types, H-cells and D-cells, according to their sucrose responses. The response to sucrose in which a depolarization was accompanied {{by an increase in}} membrane resistance had a more negative reversal potential <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> membrane potential (H-cell). The response to sucrose in which a depolarization was not accompanied by a membrane resistance change had a more positive reversal potential <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential (D-cell). It suggests that the H-cell response is due to a decrease of GK and/or G Q, membrane conductances to potassium and chloride, respectively, and the D-cell response is due to an increase in GN l...|$|R
