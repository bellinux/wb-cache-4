40|$|While {{advanced}} {{high strength}} steels (AHSS) have numerous advantages for the automotive industry, {{they can be}} susceptible to interfacial fracture when spot-welded. In this study, the susceptibility of interfacial fracture <b>to</b> <b>spot-weld</b> microstructure and hardness is examined, {{as well as the}} corresponding relationships between fatigue, overload performance, and interfacial fracture for a TRIP (transformation induced plasticity) steel. Simple post-weld heat-treatments were used to alter the weld microstructure. The effect on interfacial fracture of diluting the weld pool by welding the TRIP material to non-TRIP steel was examined, along with the effect of altering the base material microstructure. Results show that weld hardness is not a good indicator of either the susceptibility to interfacial fracture, or the strength of the joint, and that interfacial fracture does not necessarily lead to a decrease in strength compared to conventional weld-failure mechanisms, i. e. button pullout. It was also found that while interfacial fracture does affect low cycle to failure behavior, there was no effect on high cycle fatigue. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Self-piercing {{riveting}} as {{an alternative}} joining method <b>to</b> <b>spot-welding</b> has attracted considerable interest from the automotive industry and has been widely used in aluminium intensive vehicles. Pressing and stamping are important processes in automotive production and result in additional straining on the vehicle body sheet material. It is therefore important to have knowledge {{of the effect of}} sheet pre-straining {{on the quality of the}} self-piercing riveted joints and on the mechanical behaviour of the riveted aluminium alloy sheets. This paper reports the influence of sheet pre-straining on the static and fatigue behaviour of self-piercing riveted aluminium alloy sheet. Wrought aluminium alloy sheet, NG 5754 with a nominal thickness value of 2 mm was used to obtain pre-strained NG 5754 sheets with pre-straining levels of 3 %, 5 % and 10 %. Pairs of pre-strained NG 5754 sheets were joined to create single-riveted lap joints which subsequently underwent lap-shear and fatigue testing. Microscopic inspection showed that the joint quality was satisfactory despite the increasing sheet straining levels. The results showed that by increasing the pre-straining level up to 10 %, the shear and fatigue strength also increased. The rate of increase of the static and fatigue strength differed as the pre-straining levels varied. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Joining of {{components}} with structural adhesives is currently {{one of the}} most widespread techniques for advanced structures (e. g., aerospace or aeronautical). Adhesive bonding does not involve drilling operations and it distributes the load over a larger area than mechanical joints. However, peak stresses tend to develop near the overlap edges because of differential straining of the adherends and load asymmetry. As a result, premature failures can be expected, especially for brittle adhesives. Moreover, bonded joints are very sensitive to the surface treatment of the material, service temperature, humidity and ageing. To surpass these limitations, the combination of adhesive bonding with spot-welding is a choice to be considered, adding a few advantages like superior static strength and stiffness, higher peeling and fatigue strength and easier fabrication, as fixtures during the adhesive curing are not needed. The experimental and numerical study presented here evaluates hybrid spot-welded/bonded single-lap joints in comparison with the purely spot-welded and bonded equivalents. A parametric study on the overlap length (LO) allowed achieving different strength advantages, up to 58 % compared <b>to</b> <b>spot-welded</b> joints and 24 % over bonded joints.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of alternative materials {{and in particular}} aluminium alloys, for vehicle body applications has impelled {{the development of new}} joining techniques. Traditional joining methods such as spot-welding and arc-welding are being challenged. Self-piercing riveting has attracted considerable interest by the automotive industry and has been used as an alternative <b>to</b> <b>spot-welding</b> in vehicle body assembly. However, self-piercing riveting is a relatively new joining method and as such it is not well understood. The aim of this project was therefore to develop an understanding of the mechanical behaviour of self-piercing riveted joints. The effects of paint-baking, shelf-life, pre-straining and surface condition of the sheet material on the joint quality and behaviour were therefore examined. Aluminium alloy sheet materials, 5754 and AA 6111, were used in this investigation. The project began with a metallographic inspection of cross-sections of samples that were joined under different conditions in order to examine the effect of process variables on the joint quality. This part of the investigation led to the identification of suitable setting parameters that produced joints which, by metallographic inspection, were of good quality. It was also observed that some process variables, such as sheet thickness combination, rivet and die design and setting force, affected the joint quality and therefore needed to be taken into consideration in the choice of the processing parameters. Subsequent work focused on mechanical testing. Lap shear, T-peel, pull-out and fatigue tests were carried out in order to examine the mechanical behaviour and to analyse the failure mechanisms of the joints. The work showed that the strength, the thickness and the surface condition of the riveted sheets affected the strength and the failure mechanisms of the joints. The joint strength was also observed to be dependent on the rivet and anvil design as well as the setting force. In addition, the joint strength and behaviour differed as the specimen geometry thus emphasising the need for a test standard for self-piercing riveted joints. Paint baking led to a marginal and insignificant reduction in the static strength, whilst resulting in a reduction in the fatigue strength of the joints as a consequence of recovery of the 5754 alloy and the removal of the wax-based surface lubricant.

40|$|The {{design of}} vehicle front {{structures}} for crashworthiness is nowadays commonly {{based on a}} series of rigid subsystems that constitute a nearly undeformable survival cell for the passengers, and deformable subsystems able to efficiently dissipate the vehicle kinetic energy. During frontal crash, which {{is by far the most}} dangerous impact situation, the front rails represent the main deformable components aimed to dissipate the kinetic energy of the vehicle, therefore their behaviour is crucial to obtain good vehicle performance, with stable and controlled energy dissipation. The design of the front rail, usually consisting of a thin-walled prismatic column, requires definition of the geometry, that is, of the shape and dimensions of the cross section, of the thickness of the material, and of the material itself.

40|$|In the {{automobile}} industry, current demands on reduced emissions with maintained or even increased crash worthiness, forces {{the industry to}} seek weight-reducing designs. The possibility to use lightweight materials is obviously attractive. At joints, these lightweight materials have {{to be connected to}} high-strength or low-cost materials. In this context adhesive joining can provide a flexible solution. The method adds little weight to the structure, it allows for material combinations that are not possible to weld, and it provides increased stiffness to the structure as compared <b>to</b> the conventional <b>spot-welding</b> procedure. Moreover, electrolytic isolation of the multi-material joints is achieved. In this thesis, experimental methods are developed to determine the complete stress-deformation relation for an adhesive layer loaded in shear. Generally, the stress distribution is non-uniform in the test geometries used. Evaluation of experiments is performed using an inverse method. The idea is to measure the energy release rate {{as a function of the}} crack tip deformation. The stress-deformation relation is obtained by a subsequent differentiation. The method is shown to be capable of capturing the complete stress-deformation relation under stable loading conditions. A method to accurately determine the energy release rate is needed for the inverse method to be successful. A closed form expression for the energy release rate of the end-notch flexure adhesive joint specimen (ENF) is derived in this thesis. An approximate formula containing measurable quantities is also given. It is shown that both the applied load and the crack tip deformation are needed to determine the instantaneous value of the energy release rate of the ENF-specimen. Experimental results show that the influence of the crack tip deformation can be substantial. An alternative specimen is also analysed theoretically. An initial theoretical study on mixed mode fracture of adhesive layers is also given in this thesis. A detailed comparison is made of the mode-mixity obtained using two different, frequently used mechanical models; the beam/adhesive layer model, and the continuum model, i. e. a model neglecting the presence of the adhesive layer. It is tempting to assume that the two methods would produce similar results for the case of a thin adhesive layer. However, this is only the case for geometries which are materially and geometrically symmetric with respect to the adhesive layer. For asymmetric joints, on the other hand, the two models are found to predict fundamentally different values of the mode-mixity. Moreover, the mode-mixity of the beam/adhesive layer model is found to depend highly on the relative stiffness of the adherends and the adhesive layer. This dependency is found to be quantified through two parameters...|$|R
40|$|Pressure locked {{gratings}} {{have many}} uses, both {{on land and}} at sea. This is mainly due to {{the high degree of}} flexibility in dimensions and load bearing capacity. Despite the many uses in our surroundings, the term pressure locked grating is unknown to many. This term refers {{to the way in which}} the most important connection in pressure locked gratings is manufactured. Pressure locked gratings are galvanized and/or coated to prevent corrosion, galvanization is almost always used. This thesis is primarily focused on the behavior of galvanized pressure locked gratings. A pressure locked grating is made up of three type of bars: load bearing bars, cross bars and support bars. The connections between the load bearing bars and the cross bars are realized by pressing the cross bar into premade notch in the load bearing bar. The bars will deform plastically, which results in a connection based only on friction. This connection is called a pressure locked connection. The load bearing bars serve primarily for load transfer in one direction. The pressure locked connection weakens the load bearing bars. The cross bars redistribute a local load over the load bearing bars outside of the loading area and reduce the buckling length of the individual load bearing bar. The support bars are <b>spot-welded</b> <b>to</b> both the load bearing and cross bars. Pressure locked gratings are calculated according to RAL-GZ- 638, a standard published by the Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung e. V. In this standard, pressure locked gratings are calculated on the basis of linear elasticity theory. A calculation according to the EN 1993 - 1 - 1 is not possible because it is not suited for pressure locked gratings. The main objective of this thesis is to determine if a calculation based on the plasticity theory is possible for pressure locked gratings. Through the application of this theory the design strength can be greatly increased, which has a large economic potential. This research is divided up into four parts that are stated below. 9 ̆ 5 Analytical study 9 ̆ 5 Experimental study 9 ̆ 5 FEM validation 9 ̆ 5 Parametric study The vast diversity in size and properties and the complex functioning of the pressure locked connection make pressure locked gratings a difficult product to research. The pressure locked connection also has a big influence on the strength and stiffness. In this galvanizing has a big influence. The analytical study shows that pressure locked gratings fail through: local lateral torsional buckling of one of the load bearing bars, global lateral torsional buckling for the entire pressure locked grating or by a mechanism due to a plastic hinge in de load bearing bars. To research the behavior, numerical models were developed in the FEM-package ABAQUS. To determine the accuracy of these models, experiments were carried out on a number of pressure locked grating geometries. The results of the tests were compared with FEM simulations which made it possible to validate the FEM-models. The validation has taken place on the basis of four test series. Three test series focused on failure mechanisms, namely: collapse due to a mechanism as a result of plastic hinges in the load bearing bars, test series 1 A, collapse due to local lateral torsional buckling, test series 2 A and collapse due to global lateral torsional buckling of the entire pressure locked grating, test series 2 B. The last test series, test series 1 B, is aimed at examining the structural behavior of a common used pressure locked grating. After this validation it is possible to make FEM-models for a large number of different geometries. The behavior of these geometries can then be analyzed. The validation shows that failure mode and failure load are correctly determined by the FEM models. There is however a notable difference between the stiffness of the FEM-model and the stiffness of the test specimens. This difference is likely the result of the influence of the pressure locked connection between the load bearing and cross bars. The research shows that all aforementioned failure modes play a role depending on the dimensions of load bearing bars and cross bars. For relatively thick-set load bearing bars pressure locked gratings fail due to a mechanism as the result of plastic hinges in the load bearing bars. For slender load bearing bars pressure locked gratings fail as a result of instabilities. With the aid of FEM models, it is possible to estimate the extent in which the plastic capacity is present in actually produced pressure locked gratings. This analysis shows that in 72...|$|R
