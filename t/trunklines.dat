5|$|The roadways in Marquette County {{fall into}} one of three general classifications: state <b>trunklines,</b> county roads or city streets. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{maintains}} two categories of <b>trunklines</b> that run through the county: US highways and regular state <b>trunklines.</b> There have been 13 state trunkline highway designations used in Marquette County, six of which have been transferred to the jurisdiction of a city or redesignated with another number. <b>Trunklines</b> that are not Interstate or US highways bear a M-route designation with the diamond marker.|$|E
5|$|Although M-n {{outside of}} Michigan could conceivably refer to other state, provincial, local, or {{national}} highways, local usage {{in those areas}} does not mimic the Michigan usage in most cases. In countries like the United Kingdom, M refers to motorways, analogous to freeways in the United States, whereas M-numbered designations in Michigan simply indicate state <b>trunklines</b> in general and may exist on any type of highway. M-numbered <b>trunklines</b> are designated along a variety of roads, including eight-lane freeways in urban areas, four-lane rural freeways and expressways, principal arterial highways, and two-lane highways in remote rural areas. The system also includes M-185 on Mackinac Island, a non-motorized road restricted to bicycles, horse-drawn carriages and pedestrians.|$|E
5|$|Highways in {{the state}} {{maintained}} by MDOT range from two-lane rural highways up to 12-lane freeways. In addition to the Interstates, other <b>trunklines</b> are built to freeway standards. Sections of US10, US23, US31, US127 and US131 have been upgraded to freeway standards. All or part of several state <b>trunklines</b> are also freeways. In the Metro Detroit area, M-5, M-8 (Davison Freeway), M-10 (Lodge Freeway), M-14, M-39 (Southfield Freeway), M-53 (Van Dyke Freeway), and M-59 have such sections. In {{the rest of the}} state, M-6 near Grand Rapids, Conn. M-13 near Bay City, M-47 near Midland, M-60 near Jackson, and Bus. US131 near Kalamazoo are also freeways, for all or part of their respective lengths. Sections of US12, M-20, M-37, M-46, M-55, M-66 and US223 have been routed to run concurrently with other freeways as well.|$|E
5|$|When M-218 {{was first}} {{introduced}} into the State <b>Trunkline</b> System by 1936, it served as a connector between M-58 in Pontiac and US 16 in West Novi. In 1938, the route was extended into Pontiac where it terminated at US 10. The <b>trunkline</b> continued to serve in this capacity until it {{was removed from the}} <b>trunkline</b> system in 1963.|$|R
50|$|In 1913, {{the state}} of Michigan {{authorized}} the construction of <b>trunkline</b> roads through the state. A main <b>trunkline</b> route through Baraga County was designated, extending from Michigamme to Chassell. By 1915, the <b>trunkline</b> had been completed, and the Baraga County Road Commission spent {{the remainder of the}} decade slowly improving the route, regrading segments and replacing some bridges.|$|R

5|$|All public roadways in Michigan {{that are}} not state <b>trunklines</b> or city streets are {{maintained}} by the county road commission, including streets in communities that {{are a part of}} a township. Marquette County signs primary county roads with a marker bearing a three-digit number. Other roads are assigned double- or triple-letter designations in addition to any names assigned to the roadways by a city or township.|$|E
5|$|When M-35 was {{routed through}} {{downtown}} Negaunee, it joined Bus. M-28 northward {{from the east}} fork of Silver Street on to US41/M-28. This routing was moved to bypass the city in 1964 when iron ore mining activity destabilized {{a portion of the}} M-35 routing southeast of town. From this point on, Bus. M-28 has not shared its routing with any other state <b>trunklines.</b>|$|E
5|$|After heading east {{past the}} {{junction}} with I-69, the highway turns southeast as it heads through rural fields toward Eaton Rapids. Once {{it reaches the}} city, M-50 converges with M-99, and the two intersect M-188 {{on the south side}} of the Grand River. The two highways run south out of the city. Immediately prior to entering Jackson County, the two <b>trunklines</b> diverge with M-99 heading off to the southwest and M-50 to the southeast.|$|E
50|$|In 1913, {{the state}} of Michigan passed the State <b>trunkline</b> Act, which {{authorized}} {{the creation of a}} series of <b>trunkline</b> highways throughout Michigan. One such line was a north-south route through the western counties of Michigan's Upper Peninsula (Keweenaw, Houghton, Ontonagon, and Gogebic counties), tying the northern tip of the Keweenaw Peninsula to the UP's main east-west <b>trunkline.</b> The planned <b>trunkline</b> crossed both the Pike and Snake rivers near Chassell along {{the eastern side of the}} Keweenaw. The Michigan State Highway Department designed two 38 ft steel stringer bridges, designated <b>trunkline</b> bridges number 8 and 9, to cross the two rivers. The contract to build the two bridges was awarded to the Houghton-based Smith-Byers-Sparks Company in 1913, and the company completed construction of the bridges the next year.|$|R
5|$|Connector 104 is an {{unsigned}} <b>trunkline</b> in Ferrysburg {{that runs}} north along Pine Street and west along 3rd Street to connect exit104B on US31 to M-104. According to MDOT, 14,231vehicles used the <b>trunkline</b> on average each day.|$|R
5|$|OLD M-155 {{begins in}} front of the former state {{hospital}} on High Hillcrest Drive and runs north and northwesterly through a field and out of the property. The road passes some houses in the area as it curves onto Country Farm Road next to Sanatorium Lake, turning northward. From there, the <b>trunkline</b> follows Country Farm Road to Norton Road through Marion Township. The <b>trunkline</b> follows Norton Road east over the South Branch of the Shiawassee River and then northeasterly past a residential subdivision. OLD M-155 then turns due east on Mason Road, running along the Marion–Howell township line before crossing into the city of Howell next to I-96. There is no interchange for the unsigned <b>trunkline</b> as it crosses over the freeway. The <b>trunkline</b> runs through more residential subdivisions before it turns northward onto Michigan Avenue. After , the <b>trunkline</b> terminates at the intersection with BL I-96 (Grand River Avenue) in downtown Howell.|$|R
5|$|North of the line, {{the highway}} follows West Side Saginaw Road through fields {{in a less}} {{urbanized}} area. West of University Center and the campus of Delta College, M-84 crosses over I-75/US23 at exit160 and proceeds through several curves into Bay City. At the intersection with Euclid Avenue on the city line, M-13 merges in {{from the north and}} the two highways run concurrently along Salzburg Avenue. Since this segment of highway is both northbound M-84 and southbound M-13 along eastbound Salzburg Avenue, the two <b>trunklines</b> form a wrong-way concurrency.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Forest Service and Federal Highway Administration {{designate}} Federal Forest Highways providing {{access to}} the handful of National Forests in the state. In addition, Michigan participates in the Great Lakes Circle Tour program, signing tours along the state-maintained highway closest to Michigan's Great Lakes shorelines. The Michigan Heritage Route System was created in 1993 to highlight <b>trunklines</b> with historic, recreational or scenic qualities; the name was changed to Pure Michigan Byway on December 30, 2014.|$|E
5|$|The letter M in {{the state}} highway numbers is an {{integral}} part of the designation and included on the diamond-shaped reassurance markers posted alongside the highways. The state's highways are referred to using an M-n syntax as opposed to Route n or Highway n, which are common elsewhere. This usage dates from 1919, when Michigan's state <b>trunklines</b> were first signed along the roadways, and continues to this day in official and unofficial contexts. Michigan is one of only two states following this syntax, the other one being Kansas.|$|E

500|$|M-3 is a north–south state <b>trunkline</b> {{highway in}} the Detroit {{metropolitan}} {{area of the}} US state of Michigan. For most of its length, the <b>trunkline</b> is known as Gratiot Avenue ( [...] , [...] ). The <b>trunkline</b> starts in Downtown Detroit and runs through the city in a northeasterly direction along one of Detroit's five major avenues. The highway passes several historic landmarks and through a historic district. It also connects residential neighborhoods on the city's east side with suburbs in Macomb County and downtown.|$|R
50|$|Wastewater {{enters into}} Plant No. 2 via five trunklines: Miller-Holder, Bushard, Coast, Districts 5 and 6, and Interplant. The District 5 and 6 <b>trunkline</b> {{connects to the}} Coast <b>trunkline</b> at a vortex {{structure}} within the plant. Once inside Plant No. 2, the flow is measured.|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{some other}} states, {{there are no}} formal rules prohibiting the usage of the same route number under {{different}} systems. Motorists using Michigan's highways may encounter I-75 and M-75, as well as both US8 and M-8. Many of the state's US Highways were assigned numbers duplicating those of state <b>trunklines</b> when the US Highway System was created in 1926. The introduction of the Interstate Highway System in the late 1950s further complicated the situation, as each mainline Interstate designation has an unrelated M-n trunkline counterpart elsewhere in the state.|$|E
5|$|While {{the highway}} itself is largely {{unchanged}} since 1919, the connections with other <b>trunklines</b> have changed. The intersection {{south of the}} community of Chatham where M-67 has ended since designation has remained unchanged. The other highways running through the intersection have changed twice. The first highway to connect with M-67 was M-25. M-25 was replaced by M-28 in 1926. The second change came in 1941 when the routings of M-28 and M-94 were exchanged between Harvey and Munising.|$|E
5|$|After meeting M-43, the two <b>trunklines</b> run {{concurrently}} {{for about}} a mile (1.6km) before M-50 breaks off to the southwest near Woodbury. From there, the road continues in its southeasterly path along Clinton Trail through the northeast part of Eaton County as it runs through fields to Charlotte. Just prior to entering the city, the road bends {{to the south and}} near the middle of town it has a junction with M-79 and Business Loop I-69 (BL I-69). After this intersection, M-50 continues south concurrent with the business loop for a several blocks before turning eastward. On the eastern end of town, it has an interchange with I-69 at exit60.|$|E
5|$|M-203 is a north–south state <b>trunkline</b> {{highway in}} the Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. It connects McLain State Park with US41 on each end in Hancock and Calumet. The <b>trunkline</b> has existed since {{commissioning}} in 1933 except {{a period of}} time when it was temporarily decommissioned.|$|R

5|$|M-33 was {{designated}} by 1919 along {{a section of}} the current highway between Mio and Atlanta. The highway also included roadway segments south of Mio that are now parts of other <b>trunklines.</b> The portion south of Mio was rerouted in the mid-1920s, transferring sections to M-72 in the process. The state started extending M-33 in both directions in 1930s. The current highway segment between Onaway and Cheboygan was the former route of US Highway 23 (US23) until 1940 when the latter highway was realigned onto an alignment that runs along Lake Huron. Several minor changes have been made to M-33's routing since the 1950s to straighten out curves or finish paving the highway.|$|E
5|$|The {{first state}} highway along the general route of M-54 was M-10, {{one of the}} {{original}} state <b>trunklines</b> signed in 1919. Later, it was redesignated as part of US Highway10 (US10) in the 1920s. After a series of realignments in the 1940s and 1960s, the roadway was given the M-54 designation in 1962. A segment of Saginaw Road through Flint was redesignated a business route in the 1940s that became Business M-54 (Bus. M-54) as well in 1962. That business loop was decommissioned in 1974. Previously, two other highways in Michigan bore the M-54 designation: a roadway that is now part of M-37 and one that is Bus. US2 in Ironwood.|$|E
5|$|When the {{original}} state <b>trunklines</b> were designated, an M-11 ran {{the length of}} the Lake Michigan shoreline from the Indiana state line to Mackinaw City. That highway was replaced in 1926 by two of the then-newly created US Highways. A second highway was given the M-11 designation at that time in the Saline area. This highway was removed from the highway system and the designation decommissioned in 1954. The current M-11 was designated in 1961 along a set of roads in the Grand Rapids area that includes portions of a former route of US Highway 16 (US16) in Michigan.|$|E
500|$|M-247 is a north–south state <b>trunkline</b> {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan, {{connecting}} M-13 to the Bay City Recreation Area, entirely within Bangor Township. As a state <b>trunkline,</b> M-247 runs north from M-13 {{before turning to}} access the park, a distance of [...] The highway carries just over 6,000vehicles a day on average. The roadway {{has been part of}} the state <b>trunkline</b> highway system since the 1920s, and from 1961 until 1998, it was the highest non-Interstate highway in the state. Before it was given the M-247 designation, the roadway has been a part of M-111 and M-47.|$|R
5000|$|The County Road C117-Pike River Bridge is in {{excellent}} condition, and is essentially unaltered from {{when it was}} built. The bridge {{was one of the}} first <b>trunkline</b> bridges built that used the Michigan State Highway Department's steel stringer configuration. Of the 22 total <b>trunkline</b> bridges the department listed in its 1913-14 biennial report, almost half were stringer bridges, and of these Pike River Bridge is the only one to remain undemolished and unaltered. This bridge is thus significant as an early unaltered example of this important bridge structural type used in the Upper Peninsula's <b>trunkline</b> system.|$|R
50|$|By 1915, the <b>trunkline</b> highway {{had been}} nearly completed. In the 1920s, the route was {{incorporated}} into what is now US 41. In 1934, the nearby Snake River bride was replaced; US 41 was later rerouted near the Pike River, leaving the original <b>trunkline</b> bridge to service local traffic on the redesignated county road 117.|$|R
5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was first signed in 1919, M-31 {{was one of}} the {{original}} <b>trunklines,</b> originally running northward from Port Huron to Harbor Beach and then westward to Saginaw. When the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926, M-31 was decommissioned in favor of alternate numbers. From Port Huron north to Harbor Beach, M-29 was extended as a replacement. The segment west to Bay Port was renumbered M-83 while from Bad Axe west it was also additionally part of M-29 to Unionville. The remainder was numbered M-84 from Unionville to Reese, and M-81 from Reese to Saginaw.|$|E

When the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926, M-31 was decommissioned in favor of alternate numbers. The roadway between Bay Port and Harbor Beach was assigned the M-83 designation; Between Bay Port and Bad Axe, the highway was also a part of the contemporary M-29. By 1933, the M-29 designation was removed when that highway was realigned to follow the Saginaw Bay shoreline and later became parts of an extended US Highway 25 and a new M-25.|$|E
5|$|A {{rerouting}} of <b>trunklines</b> in 1941 lead to {{the creation}} of a Business US12 (BUS US12). M-96 ran concurrently with BUS US12 and M-37 was truncated to end at M-96. US12 was rerouted between Galesburg and Kalamazoo in 1954, and M-96 was extended along the former US12 routing to end in Kalamazoo. M-96 was rerouted in downtown Battle Creek to one-way streets in 1958, and BUS US12/M-96 was extended by the end of the decade when the I-94/US12 freeway was completed in the area. BUS US12 was redesignated as Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) in 1960 and M-96 was shortened to end at BL I-94/M-78 running on Capital Avenue. M-37 was reextended in 1961 in Battle Creek to a concurrent routing with M-96 in 1961.|$|E
