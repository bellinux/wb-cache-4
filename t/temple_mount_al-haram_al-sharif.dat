50|$|In 2009, Kedar and Oleg Grabar (of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study) edited {{a book on}} {{the past}} and the present of Jerusalem's <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> / <b>al-Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif,</b> whose {{possession}} has become of the thorniest issues impeding an Israeli-Palestinian rapprochement. The initiative was unprecedented, inasmuch as it succeeded in securing the sponsorship of an Israeli, a Palestinian and a Dominican institute of higher learning, all located in Jerusalem; the authors of the book's chapters were Israeli, Palestinian, European and American scholars.|$|R
25|$|Al-Aqsa Intifada {{refers to}} the Al-Aqsa Mosque, {{the place where the}} intifada started. It is the name of a mosque, {{constructed}} in the 8th century CE at <b>Al-Haram</b> <b>Al-Sharif,</b> also known as the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> in the Old City of Jerusalem, a location considered the holiest site in Judaism and third holiest in Islam.|$|R
50|$|According to The Guardian, {{many analysts}} regard {{the issue of}} access to what is known to Muslims as <b>al-Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif</b> or the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> as key to the recent {{increase}} in tension. A campaign by some fundamentalist Jews and their supporters, {{with the backing of}} some members of the Israeli cabinet, demanding greater rights for Jewish worship at the site has raised the suspicion, despite repeated Israeli denials, that Israel intends to change the 'precarious status quo' at the site.|$|R

The Resolution did not condemn or mention reported Israeli deaths, although it did deplore what it described as [...] "many other casualties." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Second Intifada {{started in}} September 2000, when Ariel Sharon made {{a visit to}} the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount,</b> also known as <b>Al-Haram</b> <b>Al-Sharif,</b> an area sacred to both Jews and Muslims. This visit was seen by Palestinians as highly provocative; and Palestinian demonstrators, {{throwing}} stones at police, were dispersed by the Israeli army, using tear gas and rubber bullets. On 28 September, Sharon, a Likud party candidate for Israeli Prime Minister, entered the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount,</b> accompanied by over 1,000 security guards. He stated on that day, [...] "the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> is in our hands and will remain in our hands. It is the holiest site in Judaism and it is the right of every Jew to visit the Temple Mount." [...] A riot broke out among Palestinians at the site, resulting in clashes between Israeli forces and the protesting crowd. Some believe it started a day later on Friday 29 September a day of prayers, when an Israeli police and military presence was introduced and there were major clashes and deaths.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount,</b> {{referred}} to in Arabic as <b>al-Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif,</b> had become emblematic of the Palestinian struggle against Zionist forces before {{the creation of the}} State of Israel in 1948. In the following two decades the Haram al-Sharif, as the last vestige of Arab sovereignty in historic Palestine, was heralded as a national symbol of Palestinians. Though venerated as a sacred space for centuries, the Haram al-Sharif was elevated in significance during the twentieth century, becoming central to Palestinian nationalist thought. This evolution was catalyzed by two Muslim councils responsible for administering the Haram al-Sharif as a religious sacred space: the Palestinian Supreme Muslim Council from 1921 - 1948, and the Jordanian Supreme Awqaf Council from 1951 - 1967...|$|R
5000|$|Opinions about {{underlying}} causes of the stabbings vary. The Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs attributes the stabbings to [...] "incitement" [...] by both radical Islamists and Palestinian government leaders, and, in particular, untruths being circulated about Israeli actions and false assertions that Israel intends to change the Status quo on the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount.</b> [...] According to The Guardian, many analysts regard the issue of access to what is known to Muslims as <b>al-Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif,</b> or the Noble Sanctuary, and to Jews as the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount,</b> as key to the recent increase in tension in Jerusalem. A campaign by some fundamentalist Jews and their supporters, {{with the backing of}} some members of the Israeli cabinet, demanding greater rights for Jewish worship at the site has raised the suspicion, despite repeated Israeli denials, that Israel intends to change the 'precarious status quo' for the site. Writing in The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg points to [...] "Muslim supersessionism", the refusal of many Muslims to acknowledge that the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> is also holy to other faiths, and a parallel unwillingness to recognize that [...] "Jews are a people who are indigenous to the land" [...] of Israel.|$|R
5|$|For centuries, al-Masjid al-Aqsa {{referred}} {{not only}} to the mosque, but to the entire sacred sanctuary, while al-Jami' al-Aqsa referred to the specific site of the mosque. This changed during the period of Ottoman rule (c. early 16th century to 1917) when the sanctuary complex {{came to be known as}} <b>al-Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Byzantine Jerusalem was conquered by the Arab {{armies of}} Umar ibn al-Khattab in 638 CE. Among Muslims of Islam's {{earliest}} era it {{was referred to}} as Madinat bayt al-Maqdis ("City of the Temple") which was restricted to the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount.</b> The rest of the city [...] "... was called Iliya, reflecting the Roman name given the city following the destruction of70 CE: Aelia Capitolina". Later the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> became known as <b>al-Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif,</b> [...] "The Noble Sanctuary", while the city around it became known as Bayt al-Maqdis, and later still, al-Quds al-Sharif [...] "The Holy, Noble". The Islamization of Jerusalem began in the first year A.H. (623 CE), when Muslims were instructed to face the city while performing their daily prostrations and, according to Muslim religious tradition, Muhammad's night journey and ascension to heaven took place. After 13 years, the direction of prayer was changed to Mecca. In 638 CE the Islamic Caliphate extended its dominion to Jerusalem. With the Arab conquest, Jews were allowed back into the city. The Rashidun caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab signed a treaty with Christian Patriarch of Jerusalem Sophronius, assuring him that Jerusalem's Christian holy places and population would be protected under Muslim rule. Christian-Arab tradition records that, when led to pray at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, one of the holiest sites for Christians, the caliph Umar refused to pray in the church so that Muslims would not request conversion of the church to a mosque. He prayed outside the church, where the Mosque of Umar (Omar) stands to this day, opposite the entrance to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. According to the Gaullic bishop Arculf, who lived in Jerusalem from 679 to 688, the Mosque of Umar was a rectangular wooden structure built over ruins which could accommodate 3,000 worshipers.|$|R

25|$|I {{knew that}} the end of September was the last period (of time) before the explosion, but when Sharon reached the al-Aqsa Mosque, this was the most {{appropriate}} moment for the outbreak of the intifada.... The night prior to Sharon's visit, I participated in a panel on a local television station and I seized the opportunity to call on the public to go to the al-Aqsa Mosque in the morning, for it was not possible that Sharon would reach <b>al-Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif</b> just so, and walk away peacefully. I finished and went to al-Aqsa in the morning.... We tried to create clashes without success because of the differences of opinion that emerged with others in the al-Aqsa compound at the time.... After Sharon left, I remained for two hours in the presence of other people, we discussed the manner of response and how it was possible to react in all the cities (bilad) and not just in Jerusalem. We contacted all (the Palestinian) factions.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount,</b> {{along with}} the entire Old City of Jerusalem, was {{captured}} from Jordan by Israel in 1967 during the Six-Day War, allowing Jews once again to pray at the holy site. Jordan had occupied East Jerusalem and the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> immediately following Israel's declaration of independence on May 14, 1948. Israel officially unified East Jerusalem, including the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount,</b> {{with the rest of}} Jerusalem in 1980 under the Jerusalem Law, though United Nations Security Council Resolution 478 declared the Jerusalem Law to be in violation of international law.

Since Mamluk and Ottoman times the term <b>al-Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif</b> (The Noble Sanctuary) has often been used as an alternative designation for the Masjid al-Aqsa compound. One needs to clearly distinguish between the term the "Masj id al-Aqsa" when used to refer generally to the entire compound and when used to refer narrowly to the roofed congregational mosque building in the south part of the compound. In this guide the "Masjid al-Aqsa" always refers to the entire compound and the "al-Aqsa Mosque building" refers to the south roofed congregational mosque...|$|R
25|$|In 1867, a {{team from}} the Royal Engineers, led by Lieutenant Charles Warren and financed by the Palestine Exploration Fund (P.E.F.), {{discovered}} a series of underground tunnels near the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount.</b> Warren secretly excavated some tunnels near the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> walls {{and was the first}} one to document their lower courses.

5000|$|<b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> entry {{restrictions}} are restrictions on entering the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem, {{which is a}} holy place for Muslims, Jews and Christians.

5000|$|The name [...] "Huldah gates" [...] {{is taken}} from the {{description}} of the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> in the Mishnah (Tractate of Midot 1:3). Accepted opinion amongst scholars is that the Mishna's description refers to the sanctified area of the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> in the Hasmonean period. Therefore, calling the gates found in the current southern wall [...] "Huldah" [...] would be an anachronism, as the base of that wall is part of Herod's post-Hasmonean extension of the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Western Wall {{served as}} the {{retaining}} wall {{of the first and}} second Temple. According to tradition, its sanctity is two-fold – it is the closest spot on earth to the location of the first and second Temples that Jews are allowed to access. Tradition holds that there are areas of the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> that are forbidden for any Jew in a state of ritual impurity to traverse. Since {{we do not have a}} Temple now, we cannot expunge ritual impurity, thus should a Jew walk atop the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount,</b> he or she may be defiling certain sacred areas. In addition to the proximity to the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount,</b> tradition holds that the Western Wall was built by donations made by the poor of Israel and that such self-sacrifice confers a special protection to the site. The <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> is now occupied by the Al Aksa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock. In Islamic tradition, Mohammed ascended to heaven from the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount.</b>|$|R
