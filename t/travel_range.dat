40|$|International audienceTypical {{adaptive}} optics (AO) applications require continual measurement and correction of aberrated light and form closed-loop control systems. One {{of the key}} components in microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based AO systems is the parallel-plate microactuator. Being electrostatically actuated, this type of devices is inherently instable beyond the pull-in position when they are controlled by a constant voltage. Therefore extending the stable <b>travelling</b> <b>range</b> of such devices forms {{one of the central}} topics in the control of MEMS. In addition, though certain control schemes, such as charge control and capacitive feedback, can extend the <b>travelling</b> <b>range</b> to the full gap, the transient behavior of actuators is dominated by their mechanical dynamics. Thus, the performance may be poor if the natural damping of the devices is too low or too high. This paper presents an alternative for the control of parallel-plate electrostatic actuators, which is based on an essential property of nonlinear systems, namely differential flatness, and combines the techniques of trajectory planning and robust nonlinear control. It is, therefore, capable of stabilizing the system at any point in the gap while ensuring desired performances. The proposed control scheme is applied to an AO system and simulation results demonstrate its advantage over constant voltage contro...|$|R

50|$|The problem {{most often}} cited by western analysts is {{the design of}} the main fuel tank. Due to the low profile of the vehicle, the {{designers}} have had to place the fuel tank between the two rows of outward-facing seats, meaning that the infantrymen sit very close to the bulk of the vehicle's fuel storage; extra fuel is carried in the hollow armored rear doors. Therefore, a hit by an armor-piercing incendiary round would set the fuel contained there (especially, if kerosene is used instead of diesel), on fire. The burning fuel would move into the crew compartment, resulting in the death or injury to the infantrymen (if they are unable to leave the vehicle via the roof hatches), and a possible explosion. However, the rear door tanks are almost always empty when the BMP goes into combat, as they are only meant to increase the road <b>travel</b> <b>range</b> of the vehicle. In intense war areas where the BMP sees action often, and it is relatively near to its base of operations, instructions highly recommend detaching the rear door tanks from the fuel system, filling them with sand as additional protection for the troop compartment, and adding fuel to the internal main fuel tank from other sources when the need arises. This was not practiced by some BMP-1s crews during a number of local conflicts, e.g., in Chechnya, which resulted in frequent attempts by the enemy to hit the rear doors of the BMP-1s. The inner fuel tank is more vulnerable than that of many modern IFVs - the thin side armor means that penetration is likely to occur to the inner fuel tank as well.|$|E
