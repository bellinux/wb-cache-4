60|$|But in {{her great}} {{features}} France {{is the same}} as ever. An oppressive air of solitude seems to hover over these rich and extended plains, while we are sensible that, whatever is the motive of the desolation, it cannot be sterility. The towns are small, and have a poor appearance, and more frequently exhibit signs of decayed splendour than of thriving and increasing prosperity. The château, the abode of the gentleman, and the villa, the retreat of the thriving négociant, are rarely seen till you come to Beaumont. At this place, which well deserves its name of the fair mount, the prospect improves greatly, and country-seats are seen in abundance; also woods, sometimes deep and extensive, at other times scattered in groves and single trees. Amidst these the oak seldom or never is found; England, lady of the ocean, seems to claim it exclusively as her own. Neither are there any quantity of firs. Poplars in abundance give a formal air to the landscape. The forests chiefly consist of beeches, with some birches, and the roads are bordered by elms cruelly cropped, pollarded, and switched. The demand for firewood occasions these mutilations. If I could waft by a wish the <b>thinnings</b> of Abbotsford here, it would make a little fortune of itself. But then to switch and mutilate my trees!--not for a thousand francs. Ay, but sour grapes, quoth the fox.|$|E

50|$|As {{the trees}} became {{established}} and were approximately 20 feet high all side shoots {{up to six}} feet were removed. This process called brashing ensured easy access, less risk of fire and the first six feet of the tree had a reduced knotty core. The next stage after brashing was pre-thinning this process was carried out after 15 to 16 years. It involved the removal of diseased trees. Larger trees known as wolves were also removed as they suppressed their smaller and straighter more valuable neighbours. Thinning began when the trees were 18 to 20 years old, coinciding with the start of World War 2. At {{this time there was}} much debate about how the work would be carried out. It was decided that racks or access ways 18 to 20 feet in width would be cut and then dividing the compartments into blocks covering 5 acres. Next, two rows of trees were removed to create a rack some 10 feet wide. The <b>thinnings</b> were graded and the straighter poles used as pit props in the coal industry. Other <b>thinnings</b> had a wide range of uses including fencing posts, pea poles in gardens and into netting stakes for the local rabbit warrens. Curved or irregular shaped cuttings was sold as firewood. In 1946, a central processing depot was established at Brandon to process poles into pit-props destined for the East Midlands coalfields. Large amounts of waste material was generated and this attracted a secondary industry of charcoal burning. As the forest matured the quantity of the <b>thinnings</b> increased with the disposal of them continued to be a problem. By 1950, demand from the National Coal Board for the timber decreased and the commission had to find new outlets, these included many of the smaller poles being cut up and converted into wallboard and some 60 tons of pine transported each week to a wood wool factory in Manchester. Large numbers of <b>thinnings</b> were taken to the Commission's own creosote plant at Santon Downham which was established in 1958 before closing in 1970. As the forest matured the size of the material being removed increased and clear felling of mature areas began with felled timber being sold directly to timber merchants. By the mid 1960s chainsaws had been introduced and by the early 1980s specially adapted tractors and trailers known as forwarders came into widespread operation. With the arrival of the harvester in 1991 full mechanization had reached the forest. Some 2500 trees were being extracted each day producing 180,000 cubic metres of timber annually by 1997. Much of this is sold to local saw mills and used in the building industry with the remainder producing fence posts, pallets and pit props.|$|E
50|$|The {{area was}} mainly {{agriculture}} until the railroads brought lumbermen, {{who set up}} sawmills to convert the trees that blanketed the state into lumber to satisfy a worldwide demand for longleaf virgin pine. Three decades later the forest acres were barren and a great many sawmills, including Gandy and Peason moved out. Reforestation was innovated in the early 1940s and pulp and paper mills bought the <b>thinnings.</b> The payoff was the development of Southern Pine plywood {{and the opening of}} Vancouver Plywood, Inc., the first plywood mill in the state, in Florien.|$|E
50|$|Thinning is an {{operation}} that artiﬁcially reduces the number of trees growing in a stand {{with the aim of}} hastening the development of the remainder. The goal of thinning is to control the amount and distribution of available growing space. By altering stand density, foresters can influence the growth, quality, and health of residual trees. It also provides an opportunity to capture mortality and cull the commercially less desirable, usually smaller and malformed, trees. Unlike regeneration treatments, <b>thinnings</b> are not intended to establish a new tree crop or create permanent canopy openings.|$|E

5000|$|... 4. Wildcrafting is the {{harvesting}} of naturally growing NTFPs. It is {{not considered}} a forest farming practice {{since there is no}} human involvement in the plant’s establishment and maintenance. However, wildcrafters often take steps to protect NTFPs with future harvests in mind. It becomes agroforestry once forest <b>thinnings,</b> or other inputs, are applied to sustain or maintain plant populations that might otherwise succumb to successional changes in the forest. The most important difference between forest farming and wildcrafting is that forest farming intentionally produces NTFPS, whereas wildcrafting seeks and gathers from naturally growing NTFPs.|$|E
50|$|During the 1930s and 1940s {{upgrading}} {{and expansion}} of the Jimna sawmill continued. In 1935 when an electric planing machine was installed, a generator {{was used as the}} power source. It was also utilised to supply homes and streetlights with power. The planer was closed in 1942 to concentrate on timber for the war effort. In 1943 a hardwood mill was started. When the pine mill burned down in 1947 it was immediately re-built with much more modern machinery. <b>Thinnings</b> from the Forestry Department's hoop pine plantations were first milled at Jimna in 1947 or 1948. The Forestry Department maintained a presence in the area thereafter. Upgrading of machinery and power sources continued into the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|Root {{vegetables}} are typically, but not always, sown from seed, rather than transplanted from plugs, {{where they are}} to mature and then be thinned. The thinning action is highly beneficial in itself as it provides soil aeration at depth without disturbing adjacent roots systems. The initial concentration of seedlings also dilutes damage from pests and provided some food for the gardener or the compost {{in the form of}} <b>thinnings.</b> Beetroot, carrots and the root brassica family- swede, turnip- will simply not reach their full potential with any check to early root growth. In addition, these seeds are typically inexpensive, and the seedlings are delicate; hence there is little value to the gardener in buying or growing them as plugs.|$|E
50|$|Shelterwood cutting {{refers to}} the {{progression}} of forest cuttings leading {{to the establishment of}} a new generation of seedlings of a particular species or group of species without planting. This silvicultural system is normally implemented in forests that are considered mature, often after several <b>thinnings.</b> The desired species are usually long-lived and their seedlings would naturally tend to start under partial shade. The shelterwood system gives enough light for the desired species to establish without giving enough light for the weeds that are adapted to full sun. Once the desired species is established, subsequent cuttings give the new seedlings more light and the growing space is fully passed to the new generation.|$|E

30|$|This {{study is}} also {{the first one in}} which advance {{regeneration}} was taken into account in the optimization of even-aged stand management. Considering advance regeneration in the analysis has a major impact on the results. It was shown that simplifying assumptions in simulation and optimization may lead to biased conclusions about optimal forest management. It seems that the optimal management of a conifer plantation involves using repeated high <b>thinnings</b> and relying on advance regeneration instead of clear-felling and planting. The maximum number of <b>thinnings</b> tested in this study was five, but most probably the NPV would continue increasing with increasing number of <b>thinnings,</b> implying that it would be optimal to switch to continuous cover management. However, the effect of additional <b>thinnings</b> on NPV would be very small since net incomes discounted from distant future would have only a negligible effect on the total NPV.|$|E

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that changes in leaf area index (LAI[*]m 2 [*]m− 2) and mean stand diameter following thinning are due to thinning type and residual density. The ratios of pre- to postthinning diameter and LAI {{were used to assess}} structural changes between replicated crown, dominant, and low thinning treatments to 33 % and 50 % residual density in even-aged Picea rubens and Abies balsamea stands with and without a precommercial thinning history in Maine, USA. Diameter ratios varied predictably by thinning type: low <b>thinnings</b> were 0. 7 but 1. 0. LAI change was affected by type and intensity of thinning. On average, 33 % density reduction removed 50 % of LAI. Overall reduction of LAI was generally greatest in dominant <b>thinnings</b> (54 %), intermediate in crown <b>thinnings</b> (46 %), and lowest in low <b>thinnings</b> (35 %). Upon closer examination by crown classes, the postthinning distribution of LAI between upper and lower crown classes varied by thinning history, thinning method, and amount of density reduction...|$|E
30|$|Several {{growth and}} yield {{simulators}} {{are driven by}} a model that predicts dominant height {{as a function of}} stand age and site index (e.g., Shater et al. 2011; Guzmán et al. 2012). Use of the dominant height model assumes that dominant height is not reduced in thinning. Therefore, high <b>thinnings</b> are ruled out also from simulations and optimizations (e.g., Palahí and Pukkala 2003; Pasalodos-Tato et al. 2009). Because of this, it is not known whether the solutions of the optimization problems really indicate the optimal stand management. Several studies suggest that high <b>thinnings</b> may be better than low <b>thinnings</b> when economic profitability is maximized (e.g., Haight et al. 1985; Haight and Monserud 1990; Hyytiäinen et al. 2005).|$|E

Secondly, the demands for wood from <b>thinnings</b> and from final felling were specified separately, and EFISCEN simulated the felling of the required wood volume, if it is available.|$|E
