5|$|Arsenal {{were not}} to win the League or the FA Cup for another 18 years. The '53 Champions squad was old, and the club failed to attract strong enough replacements. Although Arsenal were {{competitive}} during <b>these</b> <b>years,</b> their fortunes had waned; the club {{spent most of the}} 1950s and 1960s in midleague mediocrity.

Muni came 2nd in the vote; however, the Academy does not recognize Davis or Muni as nominees in <b>these</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} seven years, 1870–1877, only two works of the painter's were exhibited. These were two water-colours, shown at the Dudley Gallery in 1873, one of them being the {{beautiful}} Love among the Ruins, destroyed twenty years later by a cleaner who supposed {{it to be an}} oil painting, but afterwards reproduced in oils by the painter. This silent period was, however, one of unremitting production. Hitherto Burne-Jones had worked almost entirely in water-colours. He now began a number of large pictures in oils, working at them in turn, and having always several on hand. The first Briar Rose series, Laus Veneris, the Golden Stairs, the Pygmalion series, and The Mirror of Venus are among the works planned and completed, or carried far towards completion, during <b>these</b> <b>years.</b> <b>These</b> <b>years</b> also mark the beginnings of Burne-Jones's partnership with the fine-art photographer Frederick Hollyer, whose reproductions of paintings and—especially—drawings would expose a wider audience to Burne-Jones's works in the coming decades.|$|E

5|$|During <b>these</b> <b>years,</b> Harrison {{exhibited}} {{a number of}} personality quirks that became legendary. One was his habit of calling in subordinates to dine {{with him in the}} executive dining room by sending them a blue chip that had the meal's conversational topic written on it. Usually the topics were intellectual rather than related to the running of the railroad. Another oddity was his refusal to use his railroad pass, which entitled him to free travel. Instead, he personally paid for his commute between his home and the railroad's offices.|$|E
5|$|From the {{renovation}} in 1980 until 1985 the non-profit 5th Avenue Theatre successfully operated as {{a venue for}} touring Broadway shows. As the United States went through an economic downturn from 1985 to 1989 there was a shortage of touring shows for venues like the 5th. Consequently, many of the country's Broadway houses went unused for extended periods of time. However, the 5th remained open during <b>these</b> <b>years</b> with a reduced staff and was used for community events and local promoters.|$|E
