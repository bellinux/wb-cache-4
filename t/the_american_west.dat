5|$|Horses {{have been}} present in <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>West</b> since the 1500s, when they arrived with Spanish explorers. Many escaped, were {{released}} by the Spanish or stolen by Native Americans. Their descendents crossed with horses who escaped from or were released by other European settlers, including draft breeds brought by farmers and wagoneers and lighter riding horses brought by the United States Cavalry. Horses of French descent also moved {{across the border from}} Canada to contribute to the herds. The mixture of these breeds created the Mustang present in the western portion of the US today. By the early 1970s, it was assumed that due to crossbreeding, the original Spanish stock had been eliminated from feral herds. In 1971, the Wild and Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act was passed, giving the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) the authority to manage the feral horse populations in <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>West.</b>|$|E

5|$|Because the Columbia was at {{the same}} {{latitude}} as {{the headwaters of the}} Missouri River, there was some speculation that Gray and Vancouver had discovered the long-sought Northwest Passage.

When the American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark charted the vast, unmapped lands of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>West</b> in their overland expedition (1803–05), they found no passage between the rivers. After crossing the Rocky Mountains, Lewis and Clark built dugout canoes and paddled down the Snake River, reaching the Columbia near the present-day Tri-Cities, Washington. They explored a few miles upriver, as far as Bateman Island, before heading down the Columbia, concluding their journey at the river's mouth and establishing Fort Clatsop, a short-lived establishment that was occupied for less than three months.|$|E
