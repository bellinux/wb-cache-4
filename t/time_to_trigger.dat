40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this paper}} is to present the impact of {{different}} SHO parameters on UMTS network performance in indoor environment. The measurement results of the impact of the most important SHO parameters, i. e., the thresholds for add and drop events and their <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>trigger</b> values are presented on UMTS indoor network performance in terms of average downlink SIR target, downlink transmit power, SHO probability, and observed BER values. Due to indoor propagation channel, which causes smaller delay spread and hence less multipath diversity, a UMTS signal becomes inherently “narrowband”. Therefore, the gain of SHO against fast and slow fading would be crucial. Moreover, the characteristics of indoor radio channel enforce to apply different SHO parameter settings than for outdoor network. In the frame of this paper, the analysis is based on the downlink as it is seen more crucial from SHO point of view due to additional link required for SHOs. The measurement results indicate that relatively large thresholds for add and drop events simultaneously with a long <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>trigger</b> for drop event are the most suitable for UMTS indoor environment due to the lack of multipath diversity, and to combat fast and deep fluctuations of the indoor radio channel...|$|E
