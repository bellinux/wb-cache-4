5|$|Legally, the ACLU {{consists}} of two separate but closely affiliated nonprofit organizations: the American Civil Liberties Union, a 501(c)(4) social welfare group, and the ACLU Foundation, a 501(c)(3) public charity. Both organizations engage in civil rights litigation, advocacy, and education, but only donations to the 501(c)(3) foundation are <b>tax</b> <b>deductible,</b> and only the 501(c)(4) group can engage in unlimited political lobbying. The two organizations share office space and employees.|$|E
5|$|Crucial to the {{attractiveness}} to investors of all MIS schemes is their taxation treatment. The Australian government had {{for many years}} been encouraging agricultural and forestry investment schemes by allowing investors to claim up-front tax deductions {{of the costs of}} investment. Investors paid Great Southern a fee to lease plantation woodlots. Great Southern managed the woodlot, and the investor could deduct the cost of the lease from the income they declared that year for tax assessment purposes. The <b>tax</b> <b>deductible</b> status of the investment was widely regarded as the main attraction of MIS schemes to investors.|$|E

Clinton himself was prohibited by law from personally soliciting donations {{for the center}}, but he did host private events relating to the library. There were no other legal restrictions on donations, and the Clinton Foundation was able to accept unlimited private donations, {{all of which were}} <b>tax</b> <b>deductible.</b> Approximately $10 million of contributions came from Saudi Arabia. However, the Clinton Foundation declined to release a full donor list, similar to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library (although the foundation later agreed to disclose the top 150 donors to the House Government Reform Committee). Donations exceeding $1 million were also given from various other foreign governments (such as Kuwait and Taiwan), as well as foreign individuals. Various American organizations also contributed millions of dollars to the foundation.|$|E

25|$|A tax {{called the}} undistributed profits tax was enacted in 1936. This time {{the primary purpose}} was revenue, since Congress had enacted the Adjusted Compensation Payment Act, calling for {{payments}} of $2billion to World War I veterans. The bill established the persisting principle that retained corporate earnings could be taxed. Paid dividends were <b>tax</b> <b>deductible</b> by corporations. Its proponents intended the bill to replace all other corporation taxes—believing this would stimulate corporations to distribute earnings and thus put more cash and spending {{power in the hands}} of individuals. In the end, Congress watered down the bill, setting the tax rates at 7 to 27% and largely exempting small enterprises. Facing widespread and fierce criticism, the tax deduction of paid dividends was repealed in 1938.|$|E

Voris admitted he had been ignorant of the need to file annual reports and was following Michigan’s processes to return to good standing, and would pay the fines (five dollars per year of failing to report). Voris pointed out that while he had failed in regard to the state paperwork, the paperwork for St. Michael's Media to be a 501c organization was with the Internal Revenue Service (part of the federal government) and which had always been up-to-date – assuring viewers that donations had always been <b>tax</b> <b>deductible.</b>|$|E

500|$|Kiep {{served as}} federal {{treasurer}} of the CDU from 1971 to 1992. During his tenure, the party was involved in several financial scandals. Shortly after taking over, Kiep brought in economist Uwe Lüthje as general agent and public accountant Horst Weyrauch as a financial consultant. Together, the three started an elaborate system aimed at accumulating funding for the party. The Staatsbürgerliche Vereinigung 1954 e.V. (...) was used by major companies to donate money to the CDU anonymously, while the donations were fully <b>tax</b> <b>deductible</b> due to the Vereinigung being considered non-profit. Just in the election year 1972, 30 million Deutsche Mark {{are said to have}} been accumulated in this fashion. Over the course of its existence, the Vereinigung gave 214 million Deutsche Marks to political parties between 1969 and 1980. The procedure was made public during the uncovering of the Flick affair in the early 1980s. Kiep was ultimately accused of having amassed 18.5 million Deutsche Marks in illegal donations for the CDU, evading nine million Deutsche Marks in taxes. For his role, he was sentenced to a payment of 675,000 Deutsche Marks in 1991, but the verdict was revoked a year later by the Federal Court of Justice.|$|E

Also the reserves of two banks were significant. Other variables like loan and advances was negatively related to net earnings contrary to a prior expectation but one bank’s loan and advances was statistically significant. Lastly, bad and doubtful debt has the negative expected sign with two banks being statistically significant. Overall the fit of the model was good.
