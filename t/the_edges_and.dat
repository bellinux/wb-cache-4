5|$|The {{filaments}} exhibit random {{orientations and}} are often wavy, which has been interpreted as evidence that they were soft and pliable in life. Microscopic examination shows that individual filaments appear dark along <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> light internally, suggesting that they were hollow, like modern feathers. Compared to modern mammals the filaments were quite coarse, with each individual strand much larger and thicker than the corresponding hairs of similarly sized mammals.|$|E
5|$|The north {{transept}} contains {{three large}} murals featuring Jesus Christ: Jesus washing St. Peter's feet, the Sacred Heart, and the Pietà. The north transept also contains the tombs of two bishops. One {{is of the}} first Vicar Apostolic of the Vicariate Apostolic of Qingdao, Bishop Georg Weig, SVD who supervised {{the construction of the}} cathedral. Bishop Weig's tombstone shows obvious signs of defacement, being chipped around <b>the</b> <b>edges,</b> <b>and</b> with broken stonework at its base. The other tomb contains part of the ashes of Bishop of Qingdao Paul Han Xirang, OFM, the rest having been buried in his hometown, Han Village, Yucheng County, Shandong Province.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the estate}} had been managed as a coppiced woodland, giving Robinson the {{opportunity}} to plant drifts of scilla, cyclamen, and narcissus between the coppiced hazels and chestnuts. On <b>the</b> <b>edges,</b> <b>and</b> in the cleared spaces in the woods, Robinson established plantings of Japanese anemone, lily, acanthus, and pampas grass, along with shrubs such as fothergilla, stewartia, and nyssa. Closer to the house he had some flower beds; throughout he planted red valerian, which he allowed to spread naturally around paving and staircases. Robinson planted thousands of daffodils annually, including 100,000 narcissi planted along one of the lakes in 1897. Over the years he added hundreds of trees, some of them from American friends John Singer Sargent and Frederick Law Olmsted. Other features included an oval-shaped walled kitchen garden, a heather garden, and a water garden {{with one of the}} largest collections of water lilies in Europe.|$|E

5|$|The head {{is small}} and streamlined, adding to the agility of the cheetah. Saharan cheetah have narrow canine faces. Small, short, and rounded, the ears are marked by black patches on the back; <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> base of the ears are tawny. The high-set eyes have round pupils. The whiskers, shorter and fewer in number than those of other felids, are fine and inconspicuous. The {{pronounced}} tear streaks are unique to the cheetah. These streaks originate {{from the corner of}} the eyes and run down the nose to the mouth. Their role is obscurethey may be serving as a shield for the eyes against the sun's glare, a helpful feature as the cheetah hunts mainly during the day; another purpose could be to define facial expressions.|$|E
5|$|Over the Stock Exchange floor, Pflueger {{mounted a}} ceiling {{composed}} of interconnected sheet metal strips above {{which he used}} indirect lighting to soften <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> reduce shadows made by traders on the floor below. The result was so effective that Pflueger used it on a much larger scale above the audience seating at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, where it extended from and formed a continuity with the incised art on the proscenium. In Oakland, Pflueger flanked the stage with structures {{that appeared to be}} pillars supporting the proscenium but were instead layered, curved sheets of thin metal behind which lighting instruments cast light indirectly to give the columns a suffused glow. In 1931, he used the same concept to frame the stage at the Bal Tabarin (now Bimbo's 365 Club), and to bring a changing palette of color to the ceiling above the dance floor. Pflueger filed for and, in 1934, received two architectural lighting design patents, one for his ceiling grid with indirect lighting and one for the thin metal panels hiding lighting instruments. He used the patented ceiling grid once more in the Patent Leather Bar, in 1939.|$|E

25|$|The multiwell {{plates are}} {{manufactured}} to allow researchers {{to create and}} manipulate different types of assays (i.e., bioassays, immunoassays, etc.) within each multiwell plate.

Artifacts are due to the different environments found within the different wells on the plate, especially near <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> center of the wells. Such effects are known as well effects, edge effects, and plate effects. Thus, emphasizing the necessity to position assay designs in the correct manner both within, and between, each plate.|$|E

A track ran south from the fort, just west of the frontier wire and the border, to Sidi Omar, Fort Maddalena and Giarabub. The fort changed hands several times during the Western Desert Campaign (1940–1943) of the Second World War.|$|E

40|$|Based on micromagnetic {{simulations}} {{and model}} calculations, we demonstrate that degenerate well and barrier magnon modes can exist concurrently {{in a single}} magnetic waveguide magnetized perpendicularly to the long axis in a broad frequency band, corresponding to copropagating <b>edge</b> <b>and</b> centre spin waves, respectively. The dispersion relations of these magnon modes clearly show that <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>and</b> centre modes possess much different wave characteristics. By tailoring the antenna size, <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> mode can be selectively activated. If the antenna is sufficiently narrow, both <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>and</b> centre modes are excited with considerable efficiency and propagate along the waveguide. By roughening the lateral boundary of the waveguide, {{the characteristics of the}} relevant channel can be easily engineered. Moreover, the coupling of <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>and</b> centre modes can be conveniently controlled by scaling the width of the waveguide. For a wide waveguide with a narrow antenna, <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>and</b> centre modes travel relatively independently in spatially-separate channels, whereas for a narrow strip, these modes strongly superpose in space. These discoveries might find potential applications in emerging magnonic devices...|$|R
25|$|The {{symmetry}} {{groups of}} the Platonic solids are a special class of three-dimensional point groups known as polyhedral groups. The high degree of symmetry of the Platonic solids can be interpreted {{in a number of}} ways. Most importantly, the vertices of each solid are all equivalent under the action of the symmetry group, as are <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> faces. One says the action of the symmetry group is transitive on the vertices, edges, and faces. In fact, this is another way of defining regularity of a polyhedron: a polyhedron is regular if and only if it is vertex-uniform, edge-uniform, and face-uniform.|$|E
25|$|Hasse {{diagrams}} can visually {{represent the}} elements and relations of a partial ordering. These are graph drawings where the vertices are {{the elements of}} the poset and the ordering relation is indicated by both <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> the relative positioning of the vertices. Orders are drawn bottom-up: if an element x is smaller than (precedes) y then there exists a path from x to y that is directed upwards. It is often necessary for the edges connecting elements to cross each other, but elements must never be located within an edge. An instructive exercise is to draw the Hasse diagram for the set of natural numbers that are smaller than or equal to 13, ordered by | (the divides relation).|$|E
25|$|A {{common and}} {{somewhat}} naive {{definition of a}} polyhedron {{is that it is}} a solid whose boundary can be covered by finitely many planes or that it is a solid formed as the union of finitely many convex polyhedra. Natural refinements of this definition require the solid to be bounded, to have a connected interior, and possibly also to have a connected boundary. The faces of such a polyhedron can be defined as the connected components of the parts of the boundary within each of the planes that cover it, and <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> vertices as the line segments and points where the two faces meet. However, the polyhedra defined in this way do not include the self-crossing star polyhedra, their faces may not form simple polygons, and some edges may belong to more than two faces.|$|E
