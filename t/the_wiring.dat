40|$|AbstractThe {{high-speed}} and medium-speed wire {{electrical discharge machines}} {{which are}} originally developed in China are playing {{an important role in}} mold making. However, <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode wear is a universal problem in the machining process because <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode is used repeatedly. Considering the relative motion between <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode and <b>the</b> workpiece, the heat transfer model of wire electrode under moving heat source was established, and the temperature field of wire electrode was simulated in single pulse discharge by FEM. The results indicated that the size of the melted zone along <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode axial direction increased remarkably while the depth size, the width size and the volume of the melted zone reduced apparently when <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> running speed increased. It can be concluded that the high relative speed between <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode and <b>the</b> workpiece is beneficial to reduce <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode wear in radial direction. Furthermore, when <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> running speed is higher than a certain value, the discharge column will slide over <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode surface before <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> material reaches its melting point, thus the melting and ablation of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode material does not happen, which can almost realize no wire electrode wear...|$|R

5|$|This {{weak point}} in <b>the</b> <b>wiring</b> also ran near a {{junction}} in an ethylene glycol/water cooling line {{that had been}} prone to leaks. The electrolysis of ethylene glycol solution with the silver anode was discovered at MSC on May 29, 1967 to be a hazard capable of causing a violent exothermic reaction, igniting the ethylene glycol mixture in the CM's pure oxygen atmosphere. Experiments at the Illinois Institute of Technology confirmed the hazard existed for silver-plated wires, but not for copper-only or nickel-plated copper. In July, ASPO directed both North American and Grumman to ensure no silver or silver-coated electrical contacts existed {{in the vicinity of}} possible glycol spills in the Apollo spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{equipped}} with a main engine controller (MEC), an integrated computer which controls all of the engine's functions (through the use of valves) and monitors its performance. Built by Honeywell Aerospace, each MEC originally comprised two redundant Honeywell HDC-601 computers, later upgraded to a system composed of two doubly redundant Motorola 68000 (M68000) processors (for a total of four M68000s per controller). Having the controller installed on the engine itself greatly simplifies <b>the</b> <b>wiring</b> between the engine and the launch vehicle, because all the sensors and actuators are connected directly to only the controller, each MEC then being connected to the orbiter's general purpose computers (GPCs) or the SLS's avionics suite via its own engine interface unit (EIU). Using a dedicated system also simplifies the software and thus improves its reliability.|$|E
5|$|One of the cruiser's early {{commanding}} officers, Royal Navy Captain J.W.A. Waller, {{believed that}} the ship's single director control tower was a weak point in the design. The director control tower was the highest compartment on the ship, from where personnel would determine the range and optimum firing angle for a gun salvo, then transmit this information to the gun turrets: the actual firing could be controlled from the tower or the turret. Waller {{believed that the}} centralised system could be destroyed with a single hit, or <b>the</b> <b>wiring</b> linking the compartment to the turrets could be severed, forcing the four turrets to rely on independent control. Although Waller suggested that a second tower be installed aft to provide redundancy, it was deferred indefinitely as subsequent commanding officers did not share his concerns, and combat experiences of other Leander-class cruisers showed that the system was more robust than expected.|$|E

50|$|For example, if two <b>wires</b> {{carrying}} <b>the</b> same {{alternating current}} lie parallel to one another, {{as would be}} found in a coil used in an inductor or transformer, the magnetic field of one wire will induce longitudinal eddy currents in <b>the</b> adjacent <b>wire,</b> that flow in long loops along <b>the</b> <b>wire,</b> in <b>the</b> same direction as the main current on the side of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> facing away from <b>the</b> other <b>wire,</b> and back in the opposite direction on the side of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> facing <b>the</b> other <b>wire.</b> Thus <b>the</b> eddy current will reinforce the main current on the side facing away from <b>the</b> first <b>wire,</b> and oppose <b>the</b> main current on the side facing <b>the</b> first <b>wire.</b> <b>The</b> net effect is to redistribute the current in the cross section of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> into a thin strip on the side facing away from <b>the</b> other <b>wire.</b> Since <b>the</b> current is concentrated into a smaller area of <b>the</b> <b>wire,</b> <b>the</b> resistance is increased.|$|R

5|$|When {{conceived}} {{in the nineteenth}} century, the electric fire engine was proposed to replace the steam fire engine in use at the time.

This would require underground or overhead wiring similar to that used for electric light, trolleys, and other power users of the time. It was thought that <b>the</b> <b>wiring</b> could supply electricity to various outlet posts at strategic places throughout a city or fire protected district. These outlets would supply the necessary current to the fire-engine's electric motor. The vehicle itself was to be hauled by horses and would consist of a carriage wagon with an electric motor-powered water pump permanently mounted atop. There would be cables from the motor that would connect to the outlet post to obtain the required supply of electrical current.|$|E
5|$|Both the Zygalski-sheet {{method and}} each bomba worked {{for only a}} single {{scrambler}} rotor order, so six sets of Zygalski sheets and six bomby were produced. However, the Germans introduced two new rotors on 15 December 1938, giving a choice of three out of five to assemble in the machines on a given day. This {{increased the number of}} possible rotor orders from 6 to 60. The Biuro could then only read the small minority of messages that used neither of the two new rotors. They did not have the resources to produce 54 more bomby or 54 sets of Zygalski sheets. Fortunately, however, the fact that the SD network was still using the old method of the same indicator setting for all messages, allowed Rejewski to re-use his previous method of working out <b>the</b> <b>wiring</b> within these rotors. This information was essential for the production of a full set Zygalski sheets which allowed resumption of large-scale decryption in January 1940. On 1 January 1939, the Germans made military Enigma even more difficult to break by increasing the number of plugboard connections from between five and eight, to between seven and ten.|$|E

50|$|A {{hot wire}} {{mass airflow sensor}} determines the mass of air flowing into the engine’s air intake system. The theory of {{operation}} of <b>the</b> hot <b>wire</b> mass airflow sensor {{is similar to that}} of <b>the</b> hot <b>wire</b> anemometer (which determines air velocity). This is achieved by heating a <b>wire</b> suspended in <b>the</b> engine’s air stream, like a toaster wire, with either a constant voltage over <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> or a constant current through <b>the</b> <b>wire.</b> <b>The</b> <b>wire's</b> electrical resistance increases as <b>the</b> <b>wire’s</b> temperature increases, which varies the electrical current flowing through the circuit, according to Ohm's law. When air flows past <b>the</b> <b>wire,</b> <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> cools, decreasing its resistance, which in turn allows more current to flow through the circuit, since the supply voltage is a constant. As more current flows, <b>the</b> <b>wire’s</b> temperature increases until the resistance reaches equilibrium again. The current increase or decrease is proportional to the mass of air flowing past <b>the</b> <b>wire.</b> <b>The</b> integrated electronic circuit converts the proportional measurement into a calibrated signal which is sent to the ECU.|$|R
50|$|In many {{electric}} circuits, {{the length}} of <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> connecting <b>the</b> components can {{for the most part}} be ignored.

40|$|It {{was shown}} that the {{accuracy}} of results for wires moved laterally from mesh edges can be greatly improved by taking account {{of the behavior of}} the field in the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>wire.</b> Also, <b>the</b> distance to the end of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> can be adjusted within a cell by using a general second-order difference form for the derivative. Making <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> location completely independent of the mesh would require the additional ability to tilt <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> with respect to the edges. This seems to be a considerably more difficult problem than moving <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> laterally, since <b>the</b> component of the mesh field parallel to <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> gets mixed with the larger radial electric field due to charge on <b>the</b> <b>wire.</b> Simply averaging <b>the</b> mesh fields did not seem to work well, except in the case where <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> was tilted in one coordinate plane, and the mesh fields above and below the plane of <b>the</b> <b>wire,</b> on edges orthogonal to <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> normal, could be averaged.

50|$|These {{unpredictable}} circumstances may {{be prevented}} or counteracted {{at the beginning}} of the winding by forcing <b>the</b> <b>wire,</b> meaning, every single winding of the first layer on the inner coil diameter, into a predefined position. <b>The</b> <b>wire</b> places itself into a prefabricated groove geometry of the coil body and <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> guide does not need to follow it exactly but only approximately. Since <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> always loses in cross-sectional area due to <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> drawing to be used and the necessary deflections (mechanical stresses under tensile load) during winding, the distance between the grooves is designed only for <b>the</b> max. possible <b>wire</b> diameter. Effects of bends and tolerances of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> and <b>the</b> coil body as well as changing surface qualities can be avoided that way. Especially wire bends that develop due to wire deflections caused by, e.g., pulleys, wire eyelets or even <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> guiding nozzle itself within <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> feeder of a winding machine can lead to deformations that remain on the winding of a coil. Applying grooves to the winding basis supports the layer-accurate position of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> during <b>the</b> winding process. This behavior isparticularly beneficial for the winding processes where a plastic deformation of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> is unavoidable immediately before the depositing of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> onto <b>the</b> winding basis. This behavior can be observed especially in the needle winding technology. Due to physical reasons, it is unavoidable that <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> leaves <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> guiding nozzle at an angle of approx. 90°. Therefore, mechanical tensions remain inside <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> that are visible in the form of a bent winding on the winding basis. As a result, the following windings or also the following layers can change in their desired position.|$|R
