In one documented example, on CBS/CNet News reported, on March 7, 2011, [...] on a Wall Street Journal analysis revealing the practice of Facebook and other websites of tracking users' browsing activity, linked to their identity, far beyond users' visits and activity within the Facebook site itself. The report stated: [...] "Here's how it works. You go to Facebook, you log in, you spend some time there, and then ... you move on without logging out. Let's say the next site you go to is New York Times. Those buttons, without you clicking on them, have just reported back to Facebook and Twitter <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> there and also your identity within those accounts. Let's say you moved on to something like a site about depression. This one also has a tweet button, a Google widget, and those, too, can report back {{who you are and}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> there." [...] The WSJ analysis was researched by Brian Kennish, founder of Disconnect, Inc.|$|E
2500|$|Marcus took {{a four-day}} public holiday at Alsium, a resort {{town on the}} Etrurian coast. He was too anxious to relax. Writing to Fronto, he {{declared}} {{that he would not}} speak about his holiday. Fronto replied ironically: [...] "What? Do I not know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> to Alsium with the intention of devoting yourself to games, joking and complete leisure for four whole days?" [...] He encouraged Marcus to rest, calling on the example of his predecessors (Pius had enjoyed exercise in the palaestra, fishing, and comedy), {{going so far as to}} write up a fable about the gods' division of the day between morning and evening—Marcus had apparently been spending most of his evenings on judicial matters instead of at leisure. Marcus could not take Fronto's advice. [...] "I have duties hanging over me that can hardly be begged off," [...] he wrote back. Marcus put on Fronto's voice to chastise himself: [...] "'Much good has my advice done you', you will say!" [...] He had rested, and would rest often, but [...] "—this devotion to duty! Who knows better than you how demanding it is!" ...|$|E
