5|$|While Homer {{longs for}} his wife, Moe comes by the Simpsons' house to declare his {{interest}} in Marge, who turns him down. When Homer comes into the house with flowers he picked for Marge, Moe sees him and jumps out the window. Standing before her in rags, Homer professes his total and utter dependency on Marge, and she tells him <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a good thing, but Homer then makes his winning argument: he loves her, he needs her to love him, and {{can not afford to}} ever lose her trust again or he will end up dead. Marge is won over and allows Homer to return to the house. The family is glad that he has returned, although Moe is less than thrilled.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2006, England {{international}} Rio Ferdinand caused controversy {{by calling}} BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles a 'faggot' live on air, {{just days after}} team-mate Paul Scholes was also in trouble for an alleged homophobic remark about him being gay with a funny hair do. Moyles jokingly asked Ferdinand: [...] "If you had to, who would you rather go out with – Smudger [...] or Scholesy ?". Ferdinand replied: [...] "That is not my bag <b>that,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> my game, talking about going out with geezers" [...] and when Moyles suggested he would always prefer Smith, Ferdinand declared: [...] "You’re a faggot." [...] He quickly apologised {{for what he had}} said, stating [...] "I'm not homophobic".|$|E
2500|$|Resh Lakish {{taught that}} great is repentance, for because of it, Heaven {{accounts}} premeditated sins as errors, as [...] says, “Return, O Israel, to the Lord, your God, for you have stumbled in your iniquity.” “Iniquity” refers to premeditated sins, and yet Hosea calls them “stumbling,” implying that Heaven considers those who repent of intentional sins {{as if they}} acted accidentally. [...] But the Gemara said <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> all, for Resh Lakish also said that repentance {{is so great that}} with it, Heaven accounts premeditated sins as though they were merits, as [...] says, “And when the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.” The Gemara reconciled the two positions, clarifying that in the sight of Heaven, repentance derived from love transforms intentional sins to merits, while repentance out of fear transforms intentional sins to unwitting transgressions.|$|E

50|$|After {{playing with}} the Paraguayan {{national}} team, Jorge was spotted by scouts of Maccabi Haifa. He joined the squad along with Dante López but the two had trouble acclimating to life in Israel. Britez was expected {{to take on a}} defensive midfield role but Haifa officials later found out <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> his natural position. He ended up finishing his only season in Israel and moving on to play club football in Portugal.|$|R
2500|$|In an interview, Dappy {{described}} the song as being [...] "up-tempo, fast, party music" [...] {{as well as}} being [...] "Up-to-date and about Facebook and stuff." [...] The song lyrics follow a theme of infatuation and disappointment with each member describing their own personal experience of how they met someone they thought was 'The one' and how the person left before {{they were able to get}} the phone number. References by Dappy include how he searched on Facebook for the woman he never got a phone number from. Tulisa's story includes how she wore a [...] "LBD" [...] and [...] "Bang bang shoes" [...] when leaving her date for a moment to go to the ladies bathroom at a club and on return discovering he left her without his phone number. Despite the lyric in the song referring to searching for someone you are in love with on Facebook, in an interview with Hollyoaks, Dappy said <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> something he does: If I want to get in touch with someone, I'll just ring them, man. A lot of girls might be trying to find me on Facebook, but they won't. They'll find a fake one.|$|E

50|$|A {{franchise}} {{cost was}} set at $500,000. The Brooklyn Bolts was {{a joint venture between}} the league and Jeff Wilpon, owner of the New York Mets and Brooklyn Cyclones. The Blacktips and Omaha Mammoths were league owned and operated. The Brawlers were initially reported as being independently owned but no owner was ever identified and the league later admitted <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> true. For 2015, the franchise was to be operated by the Mahoning Valley Scrappers minor league baseball team. The Hudson Valley franchise was to be held by the Hudson Valley Renegades.|$|R

25|$|After {{the death}} of her father in 1969, Rosemary was {{occasionally}} taken to visit relatives in Florida and Washington, D.C., and to her childhood home on Cape Cod. By <b>that</b> time, Rosemary had learned to walk again but did so with a limp. She never regained the ability to speak clearly and her arm was palsied. Her condition is sometimes credited as the inspiration for Eunice Kennedy Shriver to later found the Special Olympics, although Shriver told The New York Times in 1995 <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> exactly the case.

2500|$|Cameos of note include Ivana Trump (who famously {{stated in}} the film, [...] "Don't get mad, get everything."), Gloria Steinem, and Kathie Lee Gifford as themselves, as well as author Olivia Goldsmith, {{director}} Hugh Wilson as a commercial director, and Heather Locklear as the younger lover of James Naughton's character Gil. Additionally, Jon Stewart was hired to play the lover of Goldie Hawn's character Elise; however, he never actually {{made it to the}} film. [...] "I played her boyfriend and apparently they felt <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> inherently part of the storyline and so she broke up with me before the movie started," [...] he joked on Larry King Live in 2006.|$|R

He says, 'That which is made manifest is light.' On this the best commentators and scholars agree.
