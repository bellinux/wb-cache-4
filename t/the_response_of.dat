5|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the m-type section was that at frequencies past the pole of attenuation, <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>of</b> the filter started to increase again, reaching a peak {{somewhere in the}} stop-band and then falling again.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel strategy for <b>the</b> <b>response</b> enhancement <b>of</b> olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) -based biosensors by monitoring <b>the</b> enhancive <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> OSNs to odorants. An OSNs-based biosensor was developed {{on the basis}} of the light addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS), in which rat OSNs were cultured on the surface of LAPS chip and served as sensing elements. LY 294002, the specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K), was used to enhance <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> OSNs to odorants. <b>The</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> OSNs to odorants with and without the treatment of LY 294002 were recorded by LAPS. The results show that the enhancive effect of LY 294002 was recorded efficiently by LAPS and <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> this OSNs-LAPS hybrid biosensor were enhanced by LY 294002 by about 1. 5 -fold. We conclude that this method can enhance <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> OSNs-LAPS hybrid biosensors, which may provide a novel strategy for the bioelectrical signal monitor of OSNs in biosensors. It is also suggested that this strategy may be applicable to other kinds of OSNs-based biosensors for cellular activity detection, such as microelectrode array (MEA) and field effect transistor (FET) ...|$|R

Formulas are derived for computing (1) the probability that the difference between the proportion of returnees who respond in a specified direction and the proportion of the total sample responding in that direction will be equal to or greater than an acceptable value, and (2) the minimum proportion of returns required to be fairly confident that <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> returnees are representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total sample. SURVEY researchers are often faced with the problem of a low proportion of returns and whether the returnees are representative of the total sample (Madge, 1965). Even after one or two follow-ups, a sizable proportion of the sample may still fail to respond. To determine if <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> returnees differ significantly from those of non-returnees, it is recommended that in well-supported surveys a random sample of the non-returnees be interviewed in person or by telephone.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare <b>the</b> written <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> skilled and less skilled readers to either an {{original}} or an adapted story, and <b>the</b> written <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> less skilled readers to either an original or an adapted short story. Data were compared relative to three areas: (1) statistical analysis of frequency of clausal units, and categorization of clausal units according to recall, inference, and supplementation; (2) statistical analysis of selected elements of the short story, specifically, setting, characterization, plot, and theme; and (3) descriptive analysis <b>of</b> frequent <b>responses</b> within each subcategory. Ninth grade students designated as skilled and less skilled readers by scores on the California Achievement Test formed two distinct sample populations. Subjects were randomly assigned to read either an original short story or an adaptation of the same story and write all they could recall, including selected elements of the short story, namely, setting, characterization, plot, and theme. Findings indicated that in terms of frequency of clausal units and categorization <b>of</b> clausal units, <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> skilled readers to the original story contained significantly more clausal units and inference statements than <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> less skilled readers. <b>The</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> less skilled readers to the adapted story contained significantly more clausal units and inference statements than <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> less skilled readers to the original story.
