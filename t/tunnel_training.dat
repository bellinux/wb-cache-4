25|$|During Advanced Skills Training Combat Controllers (along with PJs and SOWT) attend {{two more}} {{advanced}} courses. Army Military Free Fall Parachutist School at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona for five weeks. The course instructs free fall parachuting procedures. It also provides wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>training,</b> in-air instruction focusing on student stability, aerial maneuvers, air sense, parachute opening procedures and parachute canopy control. They also attend Air Force Combat Diver School which is hosted at the Navy Diving and Salvage Training Center, Naval Support Activity Panama City, Florida. Combat Diver School is six weeks long. After completion of Combat Diver School trainees become combat divers, {{learning to use}} scuba and closed circuit diving equipment to covertly infiltrate denied areas. The course provides training to depths of 130feet, stressing development of maximum underwater mobility under various operating conditions. A class of CCTs and PJs at the Air Force Combat Diver School was covered by Discovery Channel's program Surviving the Cut during season two, which originally aired 25 July 2011.|$|E

40|$|The Citybanan {{commuter}} <b>train</b> <b>tunnel</b> will {{comprise a}} 6 km long, double-track <b>train</b> <b>tunnel</b> to be constructed in rock under Stockholm City. In this paper, {{analysis of the}} intersections between the planned <b>train</b> <b>tunnel</b> and so-called "energy tunnels" is described. The objective of this analysis was twofold: (i) to predict deformations and stability of the energy tunnels caused by excavation of the <b>train</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and (ii) to determine required rock reinforcement for the <b>train</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Analysis was conducted primarily using the three-dimensional finite difference program FLAC 3 [). The analysis results showed that only minor deformations can be expected in the energy tunnels due to the excavation of the <b>train</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and that the overall stability of the tunnels was satisfactory. Furthermore, the results {{could be used to}} confirm a proposed rock reinforcement scheme for the <b>train</b> <b>tunnels,</b> thus securing the stability of the load-bearing structure for the rock tunnel.
