25|$|The term <b>throughput,</b> {{essentially}} {{the same thing as}} digital bandwidth consumption, denotes the achieved average useful bit rate in a computer network over a logical or physical communication link or through a network node, typically measured at a reference point above the datalink layer. This implies that the <b>throughput</b> often excludes data link layer protocol overhead. The <b>throughput</b> is affected by the traffic load from the data source in question, as well as from other sources sharing the same network resources. See also measuring network <b>throughput.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{resolution}} of EUV lithography {{for the future}} faces challenges in maintaining <b>throughput,</b> i.e., how many wafers are processed by an EUV tool per day. These challenges arise from smaller fields, additional mirrors, and shot noise. In order to maintain <b>throughput,</b> the power at intermediate focus (IF) must be continually increased.|$|E

25|$|Finished goods {{inventories}} remain balance-sheet assets, but labor-efficiency ratios {{no longer}} evaluate managers and workers.

25|$|A {{belt filter}} press {{is also known}} for its high {{capacity}} <b>throughput,</b> as {{it is designed to}} handle excess capacity. It has low initial costs and low energy running costs, however, if <b>throughput</b> is less than 4 million gallons per day, the belt filter press may be less cost efficient than liquid transport, hiring a processing facility, or utilizing non-mechanical dewatering methods such as drying beds or reed beds.|$|E
25|$|Time {{to access}} {{data can be}} {{improved}} by increasing rotational speed (thus reducing latency) or by reducing the time spent seeking. Increasing areal density increases <b>throughput</b> by increasing data rate and by {{increasing the amount of}} data under a set of heads, thereby potentially reducing seek activity for a given amount of data. The time to access data has not kept up with <b>throughput</b> increases, which themselves have not kept up with growth in bit density and storage capacity.|$|E
30|$|For fixed-rate CSMA systems, {{unfairness}} in {{the long-term}} average <b>throughputs</b> of transmitters has been investigated. Starvation of an intermediate node in a multi-hop system topology was first noted in[6]. A fundamental cause of the long-term unfairness of CSMA was shown to be the self-organization of transmission patterns[7]. Unfairness in a large CSMA system caused by the unfair advantage of border nodes at high access rates was analyzed in[8]. To eliminate border effects, channel access rates which equalize <b>throughputs</b> are proposed for linear networks and 2 × N grids[9, 10]. Determination of channel access rates which achieves target <b>throughputs</b> is investigated in[11].|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the relative <b>throughputs</b> of the 3. 9 -m Anglo-Australian Telescope's 2 dF/HERMES (High Efficiency and Resolution Multi-Element Spectrograph) system, based upon spectra acquired during {{the first two years of}} the Galactic Archaeology with HERMES survey. Averaged spectral fluxes of stars were compared to their photometry to determine the relative <b>throughputs</b> of fibres for a range of fibre position and atmospheric conditions. We find that overall the <b>throughputs</b> of the 771 usable fibres have been stable over the first two years of its operation. About 2. 5 per cent of fibres have <b>throughputs</b> much lower than the average. There are also a number of yet unexplained variations between the HERMES bandpasses, and mechanically and optically linked fibre groups known as retractors or slitlets related to regions of the focal plane. These findings do not impact the science that HERMES will produce. 13 page(s...|$|R
30|$|Conflict graph {{topology}} is {{an important}} factor affecting the short-term fair capacity. The grid topology is inherently unfair at high <b>throughputs.</b> When the Wi-Fi transmitters form a grid conflict graph the network may become severely unfair at high <b>throughputs.</b> However, in random conflict graphs, such behavior is not observed so that randomly placed transmitters are unlikely to experience this degradation in short-term fairness.|$|R

25|$|A {{functional}} model must thus achieve two aims {{in order}} to be of use. It must furnish a <b>throughput</b> description mechanics capable of completely defining the first and last <b>throughput</b> states, and perhaps some of the intervening states. It must also offer some means by which any input, correctly described in terms of this mechanics, can be used to generate an output which is an equally correct description of the output which the actual system would have given for the input concerned. It may also be noted that there are two other things which a functional model may do, but which are not necessary to all functional models. Thus such a system may, but need not, describe the system throughputs other than at the input and output, and it may also contain a description of the operation which each element carries out on the <b>throughput,</b> but once again this is not.|$|E
