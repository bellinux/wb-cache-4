Also, distance from sea, total nest depth, total eggs (clutch size), number of unhatched eggs were measured. In total, 284 eggs from 44 nests were measured. There were significant differences among the stages in term of egg diameter and egg weight. However; there are no significant differences among the stages in term of egg circumference. The egg diameter and egg weight were positively correlated with distance from the sea. Total nest depth {{was positively correlated with}} egg circumference and egg weight. The nests further from the sea and deeper from the surface have large egg size. If larger females produce large eggs, large females are attempting to nesting further from the sea and deeper from the surface. The morphometric characters of female turtles not measure in this study. Similar research can be done including female measurements in the future. These results would be useful for conservation workers or nest site managers...|$|E

We analysed eggs of western pond turtles (Clemmys marmorata) from Fern Ridge Reservoir in western Oregon (USA) for 20 organochlorine (OC) pesticides or metabolites, 42 congener-specific polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and 16 trace elements or metals. These eggs represent the first of this species analysed. The OC pesticides and PCB residue concentrations in the western pond <b>turtle</b> <b>eggs</b> were generally low and similar to those found in <b>eggs</b> of snapping <b>turtles</b> (Chelydra serpentina) from a remote site in Ontario, Canada. Western pond <b>turtle</b> <b>eggs</b> also contained mercury and chromium, which are metals of special concern. Although few reptilian eggs have been analysed for metals, the 44. 9 micro g/g dry weight chromium in a western pond <b>turtle</b> <b>egg</b> in this study may be the highest reported in a reptilian egg. We found no significant difference in contaminant concentrations in eggs from nests in Oregon, where all <b>turtle</b> <b>eggs</b> failed to hatch compared to those where some eggs hatched. During this initial project, however, we were unable to assess fully the role of OCs, PCBs and other contaminants in the western pond turtle decline. Factors other than contaminants may be involved.

Management of sea turtles including green <b>turtle</b> <b>eggs</b> is very important in maintaining its sustainability, because the eggs are a crucial part of population recruitment. One of the properties of the turtle is "homing orientation". This means that many eggs are hatched, many hatchlings are produced and then returned to the sea, and will thus improve the attendance rates of sea turtles nesting in the beach. According to data and information of the manager at the Pangumbahan Beach, the number of green <b>turtle</b> <b>eggs</b> collected during the 8 -year period of 2001 - 2008 was about 626, 115 eggs.
