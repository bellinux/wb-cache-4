5|$|Maria {{quickly learned}} of her husband's true character. She <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> him by {{cultivating}} {{a greater appreciation}} for literature and the arts, but he became increasingly dissolute: he whored, gambled, and bankrupted the couple. Maria soon became pregnant after unwanted sexual encounters with her husband. As Maria's uncle is leaving for the continent, he warns Maria of the consequences should she leave her husband. This is the first that separation or divorce {{are discussed in the}} novel and Maria seems to take his words as inspiration rather than the warning they are meant to be. After Venables attempts to pay one of his friends to seduce Maria (a man referred to only as 'Mr. S') so that he can leave her for being an adulteress, Maria tries to leave him. She initially escapes and manages to live in several different locations, often with other women who have also been wronged by their husbands, but he always finds her. When she tries to leave England with her newborn child and the fortune her now deceased uncle has left them, her husband seizes the child and imprisons Maria in the asylum. At this point the completed manuscript breaks off.|$|E
25|$|After these setbacks, Manser {{finally found}} Penan nomadic tribes near the {{headwaters}} of the Limbang river at Long Seridan in May 1984. Initially, the Penan people <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> him. After a while, the Penans accepted him as one of their family members.|$|E
25|$|The Americans were {{supportive}} of Kỳ and his {{prosecution of the}} war against the communists, and they opposed Thi, regarding him as not being firm enough against communism. Thi did, however, have the support of Marine Lieutenant General Lewis Walt, who commanded American forces in I Corps and was the senior adviser to Thi's ARVN forces. This caused problems during the dispute. The dismissal caused widespread demonstrations in the northern provinces. Civil unrest grew, as civil servants, disaffected military personnel, and the working under-class joined the anti-government demonstrations led by the Buddhists. At first, Kỳ <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> the demonstrations and wait for them to peter out, but the problem escalated and riots broke out in some places.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{thanks to}} the {{importance}} of the French market to the Dutch, {{and the fact that the}} Dutch had less possibilities of imposing counter-pressure than they had in their conflicts with the English, the Dutch government at first <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> the hostile policies of Colbert. Its inaction was also caused by differences of opinion about how best to proceed within the States Party. Amsterdam, and especially the Amsterdam diplomat Coenraad van Beuningen, argued in favor of firm economic counter-measures against the French economic policies, paired with the forming of a defensive alliance with Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. De Witt, however, preferred avoiding such foreign entanglements, and a conciliatory approach in the economic sphere. As their economic interests were severely damaged by the French protectionism, the industrial cities of Leiden and Haarlem, however, teamed up with Amsterdam to support a more belligerent diplomacy. After the Rotterdam regents were promised compensation for the damage to their wine trade, to get their assent, the States of Holland decided in 1671 on severe retaliatory measures against French imports, in effect banning French wine, vinegar, paper, and sail-canvas. The stage was now set for war.|$|E
500|$|Laurent Gbagbo gained {{recognition}} {{as one of}} the principal instigators of the student demonstrations during the protests against Houphouët-Boigny's government on 9 February 1982, which led to the closing of the universities and other educational institutions. Shortly thereafter, his wife and he formed what would become the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI). Gbagbo went into exile in France later that year, where he promoted the FPI and its political platforms. Although the FPI was ideologically similar to the Unified Socialist Party, the French socialist government <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> Gbagbo's party to please Houphouët-Boigny. After a lengthy appeal process, Gbagbo obtained status as a political refugee in France in 1985. However, the French government attempted to pressure him into returning to Côte d'Ivoire, as Houphouët-Boigny had begun to worry about Gbagbo's developing a network of contacts, and believed [...] "his stirring opponent would be less of a threat in Abidjan than in Paris".|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the film refers to a video game character, [...] "The Chumscrubber", who helps his friends {{to survive in a}} {{superficial}} world by keeping things authentic, and is portrayed as a post-apocalyptic hero, carrying his severed head in his hand as he fights the forces of evil. The Chumscrubber's world was intended to be a reflection of the Hillside community, shown by the repetition of characters' lines in the video game; a voice in the game yells [...] "Kill him! Stab him! Get him again!", the exact line said by Billy to Lee {{at the end of the}} film, urging him to stab Charlie Bratley. Producer Bonnie Curtis described the character as [...] "this sub-human monster the kids feel they are becoming". Posin commented that [...] "the Chumscrubber is everything that that community has suppressed or denied or <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore,</b> and [...] the idea that the collective denial of the community as a whole finally gives birth to a character that will not be ignored".|$|E

500|$|The {{track is}} {{followed}} by a long sample of a London Underground train arriving at and leaving a tube station, with its recorded warning to passengers, [...] "Mind the gap...". [...] "Don't Take Five (Take What You Want)" [...] follows, featuring The JAMs' associates Chike (rapper) and DJ Cesare (scratches). Built around The Dave Brubeck Quartet's [...] "Take Five" [...] and Fred Wesley's [...] "Same Beat", the lyrics are mostly unconventional, with the majority of the song containing references to food: [...] "I was pushing my trolley from detergent to cheese when I first saw the man with antler ears. I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> but his gaze held my eyes when he told me the truth about the basket of lies". Sounds considered the message of the song (if any) to be a modern version of Robin Hood: [...] "This is piracy in action, with the venerable music industry figure, King Boy D, setting himself up as the Robin Hood of rap as he steals from the rich vaults of recording history".|$|E
2500|$|In November 1987, Moore {{was struck}} down with {{bacterial}} pneumonia. He initially <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> the illness and attended a cabinet meeting {{before he had}} recovered. During the meeting he became unconscious. He was subsequently admitted to the Parkside Hospital in Wimbledon. The {{fact that this was}} a private clinic owned by a German healthcare company (reportedly charging patients up to £2,000 per day) attracted bad publicity. Union leader Rodney Bickerstaffe stated [...] "How can a social services secretary claim to care about the National Health Service when he does not even trust his own health care to an NHS hospital?".|$|E
2500|$|At that point, Kapodistrias, {{the foreign}} {{minister}} of Russia, was ordered by Alexander I to send Ypsilantis a letter upbraiding him for misusing the mandate received from the Tsar; Kapodistrias announced to Ypsilantis that his name had been struck off the army list and that he was commanded to lay down arms. Ypsilantis <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> the letter, but Vladimirescu took this as the end of his commitment to the Eteria. A conflict erupted inside his camp and Vladimirescu was tried and put to death by the Eteria on 26May [...] The loss of their Romanian allies, followed by an Ottoman intervention on Wallachian soil, sealed defeat for the Greek exiles and culminated in the disastrous Battle of Dragashani and the destruction of the Sacred Band on 7June [...]|$|E

2500|$|The {{dismissal}} caused widespread {{demonstrations in}} the northern provinces. Initially, the pro-Buddhist demonstrations in I Corps and Saigon were mild and orderly. However, the unrest steadily grew, as civil servants, disaffected military personnel, and the working under-class, in part upset with the economic problems, joined the anti-government demonstrations. At first, Prime Minister Kỳ <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> the demonstrations and {{wait for them to}} peter out, and to do not fight the dissidents, so as to [...] "not to provide any martyrs". Thi was immensely popular in the Buddhist stronghold of Huế. A general strike had incapacitated 90% of Da Nang, the largest city in central Vietnam and the second biggest in the entire country. In Saigon, 10,000 attended a Buddhist rally to call for elections and civilian rule and the monks used Thi's dismissal to focus attention on the junta's rule.|$|E
2500|$|The {{disease may}} have been {{inspired}} by tuberculosis (or consumption, as it was known then), since Poe's wife Virginia was suffering from the disease at the time the story was written. Like the character Prince Prospero, Poe <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> the fatality of the disease. Poe's mother Eliza, brother William, and foster mother Frances had also died of tuberculosis. Alternatively, the Red Death may refer to cholera; Poe would have witnessed an epidemic of cholera in Baltimore, Maryland in 1831. Others have suggested the pandemic is actually Bubonic plague or the Black death, emphasized by the climax of the story featuring the [...] "Red" [...] Death in the [...] "black" [...] room. One writer likens the description to that of a viral hemorrhagic fever or necrotizing fasciitis. It has also been suggested that the Red Death is not a disease or sickness at all but a weakness (like [...] "original sin") that is shared by all of humankind inherently.|$|E
2500|$|Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles was not {{correctly}} translated. Instead of stating [...] "...Germany accepts {{responsibility of}} Germany and her allies causing all the loss and damage...", the German Government's edition reads, [...] "Germany admits it, that Germany and her allies, as {{authors of the}} war, are responsible for all losses and damages...". This resulted in a prevailing belief of humiliation among Germans; the article {{was seen as an}} injustice and there was a view that Germany had signed [...] "away her honor". Despite the public outrage, German government officials were aware [...] "that Germany's position on this matter was not nearly so favorable as the imperial government had led the German public to believe during the war". Politicians seeking international sympathy would continue to use the article for its propaganda value, persuading many who had not read the treaties that the article implied full war guilt. German revisionist historians who later <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> the validity of the clause found a ready audience among revisionist writers in France, Britain, and the USA. The objective of both the politicians and historians was to prove that Germany was not solely guilty for causing the war; if that guilt could be disproved the legal requirement to pay reparations would disappear.|$|E

50|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{partners}} that offer social support can also offer social undermining.
