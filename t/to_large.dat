40|$|AbstractPortion {{sizes of}} many foods have {{increased}} in recent times. In three studies we examined the effect that repeated visual exposure <b>to</b> <b>larger</b> versus smaller food portion sizes has on perceptions {{of what constitutes a}} normal-sized food portion and measures of portion size selection. In studies 1 and 2 participants were visually exposed <b>to</b> images of <b>large</b> or small portions of spaghetti bolognese, before making evaluations about an image of an intermediate sized portion of the same food. In study 3 participants were exposed <b>to</b> images of <b>large</b> or small portions of a snack food before selecting a portion size of snack food to consume. Across the three studies, visual exposure <b>to</b> <b>larger</b> as opposed <b>to</b> smaller portion sizes resulted in participants considering a normal portion of food <b>to</b> be <b>larger</b> than a reference intermediate sized portion. In studies 1 and 2 visual exposure <b>to</b> <b>larger</b> portion sizes also increased the size of self-reported ideal meal size. In study 3 visual exposure <b>to</b> <b>larger</b> portion sizes of a snack food did not affect how much of that food participants subsequently served themselves and ate. Visual exposure <b>to</b> <b>larger</b> portion sizes may adjust visual perceptions of what constitutes a ‘normal’ sized portion. However, we did not find evidence that visual exposure <b>to</b> <b>larger</b> portions altered snack food intake...|$|R
