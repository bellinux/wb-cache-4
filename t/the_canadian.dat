60|$|It {{needed some}} hard work before <b>the</b> <b>Canadians,</b> who fought bravely, could be cleared {{out from the}} thickets. The French troops did not rally from their {{disorder}} till they had crossed the Saint Charles. <b>The</b> <b>Canadians</b> retired in better order.|$|R
5000|$|Despite Kildare's strict {{orders for}} {{his men to}} shoot Italian deserters on sight, <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> take kindly {{to a pair of}} buffoonish Italian deserters, more notable for their culinary skills than {{military}} prowess. Impetuously, Kildare orders <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> to execute <b>the</b> Italians. <b>The</b> <b>Canadians</b> are caught between the obligation to follow orders and the sense that executing the two Italians in cold blood is ethically unjustifiable - not to mention it being a violation of the Geneva Convention. The brutal execution of the two Italians forces <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> to confront <b>the</b> ethics of warfare, now that [...] "the enemy" [...] is no longer a distant and faceless target. Major Bunny Bazin, the most battle-hardened and philosophical of <b>the</b> <b>Canadians,</b> voices <b>the</b> novel's central theme when he states that [...] "execution is... the ultimate degradation of man." [...] Here the term [...] "execution" [...] works both literally (the killing of the Italians as a brutal act) and as a metaphor (war as a form of mass execution).|$|R

A unique system of cadency is used for daughters inheriting arms, and a special symbol for United Empire Loyalists.|$|E
5|$|During {{much of the}} war, the 2nd Canadian Regiment {{was known}} as Congress's Own Regiment, and Livingston's command {{continued}} {{to be known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Canadian</b> Regiment. Greatly depleted by its five years of service, Livingston's regiment was disbanded in the reorganization of the Continental Army on January 1, 1781. Its Canadian elements were assigned to Hazen's command, which was then redesignated as <b>the</b> <b>Canadian</b> Regiment.|$|E
50|$|A {{few weeks}} later, on May 5, <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> managed {{to capture the}} village.

50|$|The next morning, the Germans {{launch an}} attack on <b>the</b> <b>Canadians,</b> but fail. <b>The</b> <b>Canadians</b> push to <b>the</b> airfield, and secure it after {{clearing}} the hangars. As Cutting radios the Royal Scots, he and Major Blackmore find that Hill 112 is under attack.|$|R
50|$|German {{documents}} captured {{after the}} war showed that Operation Penknife was successful in concealing <b>the</b> movement of <b>Canadian</b> troops from Italy to Belgium. Until late March, German intelligence maps showed <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> to be at various places in Italy. On March 17, when all Canadians were either in Belgium or northern France, the Germans still believed <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> were in <b>the</b> Ancona area, although {{the exact location of}} <b>the</b> 1st <b>Canadian</b> Armoured Brigade was unknown. Only in mid-April did the German maps show <b>the</b> absence of <b>Canadian</b> troops.|$|R

Following the game, members of <b>the</b> <b>Canadian</b> team accused the Americans of stomping on a Canadian flag in their dressing room, although an investigation later proved the rumour false. The Swedish team won the bronze medal over Finland, the nation's first in women's ice hockey.|$|E
