40|$|Between 1987 and 1996 <b>Chinese</b> <b>exports</b> {{increased}} {{by an average}} of 14 % each year. During this decade, export growth became a crucial determinant of overall economic growth. However, {{as a consequence of the}} East Asian financial crises, <b>Chinese</b> <b>export</b> growth slowed, threatening the successful implementation of plans to restructure the domestic Chinese economy. This paper traces the reasons for the rapid growth and subsequent slowing of <b>Chinese</b> <b>exports,</b> and asks whether the strategy provides a solid basis for the long term development of the Chinese economy. In particular, the paper focuses on the role and significance of the processing trade in boosting <b>Chinese</b> <b>exports.</b> The high proportion of imported components in processed exports questions whether China is really benefiting as much from export growth as aggregate trade figures seem to suggest...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} an {{empirical}} {{analysis of the}} organization of <b>Chinese</b> <b>exports,</b> their comparative advantage, and technological structure, using the statistical data of Chinese foreign trade in recent years. The result demonstrates that labor-intensive products form the largest ratio of <b>Chinese</b> <b>exports</b> and also those that have the comparative advantage. The proportion of skill- and technology-intensive products is growing larger compared with the gross amount of general <b>Chinese</b> <b>exports</b> and among products with comparative advantage. However, compared with the average level in the world, the technology contained in <b>Chinese</b> <b>exports</b> is lower, and the growth of exports is mainly one of quantitative expansion. This article posits that the implementation of the strategy of sustainable development of foreign trade guided by competitive advantage is the necessary path for promoting the international competitive capacity of Chinese foreign trade products and obtaining more comparative interests. ...|$|R

This alteration in the export sector induces changes within the manufacturing industries, especially a decline in employment. The analysis using more aggregated, regional level data, shows that the industry sector as whole declines resulting, amongst others, in an increased unemployment rate.

Strongly increasing <b>Chinese</b> <b>exports</b> did not have a noticeable impact on the pace of restructuring in the Netherlands. Nor did this development lead to higher unemployment or did it cause a marked widening of Dutch income differentials. Concerning competition on world markets, <b>Chinese</b> <b>export</b> products are more complements than substitutes for Dutch <b>export</b> products. The <b>Chinese</b> economy is expected to continue its rapid expansion. Over the next five years, <b>Chinese</b> <b>exports</b> are likely to double.

The results of luxury export trade can still be seen through current patterns of consumption, {{the growth of the}} United States economy, and revived interest in Chinese designs still evident in European and American homes. During research conducted during the summer of 2014, the conservation treatment of a <b>Chinese</b> <b>export</b> lacquerware shawl box, 1964. 0084 D, from the Winterthur Museum and Country Estate collection, was performed. The shawl box was chosen as it exemplified the monumental impact <b>Chinese</b> <b>export</b> had on developing trading ports across America, specifically focusing on Salem, Massachusetts. The shawl box was analyzed through the techniques of pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS), ultraviolet light (UV) auto-fluorescence, and chemical staining in order to accurately assess the current condition of the object and develop an appropriate conservation treatment plan. After learning one lacquerware conservation technique through the shawl box treatment, I aimed to develop an alternative methodology that would eliminate some material issue concerns that arose during the shawl box treatment and facilitate the treatment of larger losses. This thesis aims to develop a mold and cast system which completely eliminates the use of water while reducing the amount of time an object is handled during the conservation treatment of varnished <b>Chinese</b> <b>export</b> lacquerware pieces.

40|$|This paper compares European and <b>Chinese</b> <b>exports</b> in the {{clothing}} sector {{since the end}} of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement in 2005. Using detailed product-level data from UN Comtrade, we document the pattern of export prices and quantities observed for both countries, considering both exports to the rest of the world and to a particular destination market. We find that within narrowly defined product categories, European varieties typically sell for a higher price than Chinese varieties. But this price gap is narrowing. Despite rising prices, Chinese varieties are increasingly selling more than European varieties, suggesting that quality differences are narrowing. While European “core” products in clothing are stable over time, <b>Chinese</b> <b>exports</b> show strong product dynamics with exit and entry of new “core” products every year and “core” products changing rapidly. Both China and the EU export in every product category, resulting in a perfect product overlap with no products being exported by only one of the two. To make sure that our findings are not driven by a different product mix or a different destination country mix of EU versus <b>Chinese</b> <b>exports,</b> we compare EU and <b>Chinese</b> <b>exports</b> of clothing to the US and limit the comparison to HS 6 product categories that are exported by both countries to the US. Again we obtain similar results as those obtained by comparing EU and <b>Chinese</b> <b>exports</b> to the rest of the world. Also, our evidence is suggestive of China exporting its high quality goods, while the EU exporting its most efficiently produced goods. ...|$|R
