I also regress on other Portuguese time series in order to control for the effect of inequality series. Applying cointegration techniques and testing the causality direction, I conclude that there is a statistical validation that, as the distribution becomes more unequal, <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> of <b>the</b> transferred grants decrease.

5|$|Early in {{its life}} as a {{tropical}} cyclone, Ewiniar affected Yap and Palau, which fall under the warning jurisdiction of the National Weather Service office in Tiyan, Guam. Ewiniar caused coastal flooding in Yap of up to 5feet (1.5m), especially near the port and around the Colonia Bay area. Ewiniar also caused an island-wide power outage in Yap, although according to an NWS post-storm report, damage was minimised on Yap due to steadier structures after Super Typhoon Sudal of 2004 tore through the islands. Damage was also reported to agriculture due to salt spray. <b>The</b> <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of damage caused {{was estimated to be}} just over $100 thousand (2006USD).|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium has a {{high rate}} of nuclear fission that results in a low {{critical}} mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This mass is 9.89 kilograms for a bare sphere of 254Es isotope, and can be lowered to 2.9 by adding a 30 centimeter thick steel neutron reflector, or even to 2.26 kilograms with a 20cm thick reflector made of water. However, even this small critical mass greatly exceeds <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of einsteinium isolated thus far, especially of the rare 254Es isotope.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme rates {{depend on}} {{solution}} conditions and substrate concentration. To find {{the maximum speed}} of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen. This {{is shown in the}} saturation curve on the right. Saturation happens because, as substrate concentration increases, {{more and more of the}} free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound ES complex. At the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of the enzyme, all the enzyme active sites are bound to substrate, and the amount of ES complex is the same as <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of enzyme.|$|E
