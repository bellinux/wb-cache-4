No wounds were found on any skull elements, in contrast to tyrannosaurids where sometimes gruesome facial bites were common.

5|$|A popular {{approach}} {{to improve performance}} {{is to create a}} memory pool-based allocator. Instead of allocating memory every <b>time</b> <b>an</b> item is inserted or removed from a container, a large block of memory (the memory pool) is allocated beforehand, possibly at the startup of the program. The custom allocator will serve individual allocation requests by simply returning a pointer to memory from the pool. Actual deallocation of memory can be deferred until the lifetime of the memory pool ends. An example of memory pool-based allocators {{can be found in the}} Boost C++ Libraries.|$|E

5|$|Candaules was {{completed}} and {{exhibited at the}} Royal Academy in 1830. Etty felt that the moral lesson of the story was that women were not male chattels, and that if men—even their husbands—violated a woman's rights she was within her rights to punish them. However, he made little effort to explain what was, at the <b>time,</b> <b>an</b> unusual view, instead allowing viewers to form their own judgement of the piece. Thus, unusually for a painting of the time, Candaules appears morally highly ambiguous, inviting the viewer to sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules, the murderous Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges.|$|E

When the results of these treatments were compared with those obtained previously with tetracycline 250 mg. four <b>times</b> <b>a</b> day for 4 days and allowance was made for the time at which the latter results have been assessed, it was concluded that neither the treatment used in the double-blind trial nor Deteclo 300 mg. three <b>times</b> <b>a</b> day for 3 weeks offered any advantage over the customary treatment with tetracycline 250 mg, four <b>times</b> <b>a</b> day for 4 days...|$|R
