The game included 11 lead changes and 16 ties.

5|$|Following the Nevada kickoff, Turner handed off to Scott, {{who picked}} up two yards. After an {{incomplete}} pass, Turner connected with Torrey Smith on a 26-yard toss for a third-down conversion. Scott then rushed for three {{yards to the}} Nevada 49-yard line, and carried it again down the middle, this time breaking free for a 49-yard touchdown run. On the following Nevada series, Kaepernick mounted a 38-yard drive to the Maryland 34-yard line, but failed to convert on fourth and12. On the next series, Da'Rel Scott was handed the ball four times in succession to pick up first downs with rushes of 11, 23, 30yards and a touchdown on a two-yard run. The score and extra point gave Maryland a two-touchdown lead, 42–28. Nevada's offense returned to the field with 7:44remaining {{in the game and}} used almost three minutes in a 37-yard drive that culminated in an interception by Maryland safety Jeff Allen on the Maryland 38-yard line. After no gain on a rush by running back Morgan Green, Maryland attempted an end-around. Turner was stepped on, and the handoff was botched. The intended recipient, Heyward-Bey, dropped the ball but managed to recover it for a loss of six yards. After Nevada called a time out, Green rushed for a five-yard gain. Nevada expended its last remaining <b>time</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> stop the clock with 4:06left. Maryland punted it away on fourth down with 11yards to go.|$|E

The Promo 45RPM Single/Radio Edit was shortened to 4:45, vividly editing the piano intro and going into a quick fade-out, just before the closing choruses. The B-side of the Radio Edit Promo was the 5:35 version, as was the B-side of the DJ-Only 12" [...] Single.|$|R

500|$|Michigan's defense {{played a}} strong game, and its line was {{described}} as [...] "a veritable stone wall." [...] Throughout the game, both teams played a kicking game, punting on second or third down and hoping for a break.

[...] The referee would then charge <b>time</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> himself so the centers could wipe off the ball before punting.

Two days and they were done – including the mix. It's quite standard for a young punk band to do that," [...] said engineer Jeff Forrest. Despite this, the liner notes for the cassette claim it was recorded in twelve hours, while the later remaster of Buddha contend it was recorded [...] "over three rainy nights."

Ann Powers of Blender called [...] "Do Somethin'" [...] "a decent bit of crunk where she raps in a cutesy-poo drawl that suggests she could have nabbed the Dukes of Hazzard sexpot role from Jessica Simpson".

Pete Hines, Vice President of PR and Marketing for Bethesda, and Todd Howard, Executive Producer for the game, gave an update about the delay on the weekend of November 6, 2005. They planned to give updates every subsequent weekend until the game's release. A commentator from Joystiq complained of the vagueness of the updates: [...] "they don't get any more specific than to say, 'There is work that {{still needs to be}} done'. In fact, they say this three times just to make sure we know how hard they are working....While it's nice to see the development team taking <b>time</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> update the fans, if the announcements continue to be as vague as this one, I'd rather just see them spend the extra time on the actual game." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 3, Brad Stevens and the Butler Bulldogs faced {{off with}} Michigan State in the {{national}} semi-finals. Michigan State took an early 14–7 lead, and Matt Howard got in early foul trouble, sitting most the first half. Stevens kept the team focused with a [...] "next man up" [...] attitude and the game was tied at 28 at halftime. The second half was dominated by tight defense for both sides. With 2:45 {{to go in the}} game, the score was 47–44 Butler. Michigan State called a <b>time</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> set up a play. Stevens correctly anticipated the play call and had Ronald Nored, the team's best defender, switch onto Korie Lucious off a screen. Nored stole the ball and Shawn Vanzant got fouled on the resulting run out, hitting 1 of 2. Trailing 50–49 with under 30 seconds remaining, Michigan State came up empty and was forced to foul. Nored hit both foul shots, giving Butler a 52–49 lead. After a Michigan State time out, Stevens had his team foul Lucious with 2 seconds remaining to prevent a potentially game tying 3-pointer. After making the first, Lucious intentionally missed the second free throw. Hayward came down with the rebound to seal the victory. Butler became the first team since the shot clock was adopted for the 1985–86 season to hold five straight tournament opponents under 60 points.|$|E
