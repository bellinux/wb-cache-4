On February 21, Duquesne again returned home for a nationally-televised game against the Dayton Flyers. Senior Jason Duty was honored in a pre-game ceremony, and the game's attendance of 5,144was only 214short of the A.J. Palumbo Center's capacity. A late layup drive by Damian Saunders put the Dukes up by one, and they went on to win 73–71.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{proteasome}} normally produces {{very short}} peptide fragments, {{in some cases}} these products are themselves biologically active and functional molecules. Certain transcription factors regulating the expression of specific genes, including one component of the mammalian complex NF-κB, are synthesized as inactive precursors whose ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation converts <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> active form. Such activity requires the proteasome to cleave the substrate protein internally, rather than processively degrading it from one terminus. It {{has been suggested that}} long loops on these proteins' surfaces serve as the proteasomal substrates and enter the central cavity, while the majority of the protein remains outside. Similar effects have been observed in yeast proteins; this mechanism of selective degradation is known as regulated ubiquitin/proteasome dependent processing (RUP).|$|E

5|$|At the camp, Theo and Kee meet a Romanian woman, Marichka, who {{provides}} {{a room where}} Kee gives birth to a baby girl. The next day, Syd finds them in their room, and informs Theo and Kee that war has broken out between the British Army and the refugees, including the Fishes. Having learned {{that they have a}} bounty on their heads, Syd attempts to capture them, but Marichka and Theo fight him off and escape. Amidst the fighting, the Fishes capture Kee and the baby. Theo tracks <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> apartment under heavy fire where he confronts Luke, who is then killed by a tank shell, and escorts Kee and the baby out. Awed by the baby, the combatants temporarily stop fighting; staring at the screaming baby, they allow the group to leave. Marichka leads Theo, Kee, and the baby to a boat in a sewer, and Theo rows away whilst Marichka stays behind.|$|E

There, Halsey contacts the team and shows them a massive Forerunner structure buried beneath the surface. Halsey downloads Cortana and gives her to the soldier Noble 6, instructing the team to bring the AI to the UNSC ship Pillar of Autumn. While most of Noble Team's six soldiers were killed, Noble 6 hands Cortana over to Captain Keyes and elects to stay behind and protect the ship while it makes its escape.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} week of the war, Johnson's {{squadron}} flew patrols over Berlin and Kiel as German resistance crumbled. During a flight over central Germany looking for jet fighters, Johnson's squadron attacked Luftwaffe airfields. On one sortie, his unit strafed and destroyed 11 Bf 109s that were preparing to take off. On another sortie, an enemy transport was sighted, but took evasive action and retreated back to German held territory but Johnson's pilots shot it down. On another occasion, Johnson intercepted a flight of four Fw 190s. The German fighters, however, waggled their wings to signal non-hostile intent and Johnson's unit escorted <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> RAF airfield.|$|E

5|$|In 1895 he {{designed}} a funerary chapel for the Güell {{family at the}} abbey of Montserrat, but {{little is known about}} this work, which was never built. That year, construction finally began on the Bodegas Güell, the 1882 project for a hunting lodge and some wineries at La Cuadra de Garraf (Sitges), property of Eusebi Güell. Constructed between 1895 and 1897 under the direction of Francesc Berenguer, Gaudí's aide, the wineries have a triangular end facade, a very steep stone roof, a group of chimneys and two bridges that join <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> older building. It has three floors: the bottom one for a garage, an apartment and a chapel with catenary arches, with the altar in the centre. It was completed with a porter's lodge, notable for the iron gate {{in the shape of a}} fishing net.|$|E

In the following two years, Friedgen became the only ACC head coach to have led his team to win ten games {{in each of his}} first three seasons. In his ten-year tenure, Friedgen led the Terrapins to seven bowl appearances. Most recently, Maryland concluded the 2010 season with a 9-4 record, a win in the Military Bowl, and a top 25 national ranking.|$|E
5|$|Intergem {{rocked the}} gem trade by {{marketing}} the Yogo as the world's only guaranteed untreated sapphire. By 1982, {{the practice of}} routinely heat treating gems had become {{a major issue in}} the industry. At the time, 95percent of all the world's sapphires were being heated to enhance their natural color. Thai traders had even purchased large quantities of naturally colorless Sri Lankan sapphires, known as geuda, and heated <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> artificial blue. A problem with the practice was that heated gems often fade over time, though trained gemologists can detect a heated gem with 95percent accuracy. Intergem's marketing of guaranteed untreated Yogos set them against many in the gem industry. In 1985 there was a movement in Pennsylvania to require disclosure that a gem had been treated. Intergem's strategy resulted in large numbers of gem professionals visiting Yogo Gulch.|$|E

5|$|Large three-toed {{footprints}} {{are known}} in Early Cretaceous rocks of England, particularly Wealden beds on the Isle of Wight, and these trace fossils were originally difficult to interpret. Some authors associated them with dinosaurs early on. In 1846, E. Tagert {{went so far}} as to assign <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> ichnogenus he named Iguanodon, and Samuel Beckles noted in 1854 that they looked like bird tracks, but might have come from dinosaurs. The identity of the trackmakers was greatly clarified upon the discovery in 1857 of the hind leg of a young Iguanodon, with distinctly three-toed feet, showing that such dinosaurs could have made the tracks. Despite the lack of direct evidence, these tracks are often attributed to Iguanodon. A trackway in England shows what may be an Iguanodon moving on all fours, but the foot prints are poor, making a direct connection difficult. Tracks assigned to the ichnogenus Iguanodon are known from locations including places in Europe where the body fossil Iguanodon is known, to Spitsbergen, Svalbard, Norway.|$|E
5|$|On 5 November, TPD was {{formally}} liquidated at a creditors' meeting. It was revealed, to {{the anger of}} the creditors, that Sinclair had taken out a £5 million debenture to cover the money that he had put into the company. Ordinary creditors faced little prospect of recovering the £1 million left outstanding. Primary Contact, the marketing agency used by Sinclair to promote the C5, was left with the biggest unpaid bill, of nearly £500,000. The last of the unsold C5s were bought for £75 each by Ellar (Surplus Goods) Ltd of Liverpool, which planned to sell 1,000 of <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> Egyptian businessman for use on a university campus while another 1,500 were intended to be sold in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Stein {{continued}} {{to manage the}} Columbia Mets in 1990, leading <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> 83–60 record. The Mets had {{the best record in}} the South Atlantic League that season. In 1991, Stein was hired to be the manager of the Bend Bucks of the Northwest League. The non-affiliated Bucks had a record of 30–46 with Stein as the manager. He was hired to be the manager of the Clinton Giants in 1992. Clinton was the Class-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants at the time. Stein led Clinton to a 59–79 record that year. After considering taking a year off of baseball in 1994, Stein eventually accepted the managerial position with the independent league Tyler WildCatters.|$|E

5|$|The Crusaders {{defeated}} the Sharks 36-8 in the qualifier round. For the semi-final the Crusaders {{had to cross}} the Indian Ocean to Cape Town to play the Stormers. Despite travelling 11,000km the Crusaders {{defeated the}} Stormers 29-10 in a convincing display. The Crusaders faced the Reds in the Final and yet more travel. The Crusaders and Reds were matched evenly at 13-13 after exchanging a try apiece and two penalty's. However, Will Genia scored a crucial try for the Reds in the 68th minute to help <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> 18–13 win. The Crusaders lost the final to the Queensland Reds at the Suncorp Stadium. Despite not winning the title in 2011, the trials the Crusaders overcame to even make the final, made this season one of the Crusaders finest.|$|E
5|$|To learn whether errors {{actually}} {{existed in}} Lilienthal's data tables, the brothers used a bicycle {{for a new}} type of experiment. They made a model-size airfoil and a counter-acting flat plate, both according to dimensions Lilienthal had specified, and attached <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> extra bicycle wheel, which they mounted horizontally in front of the handlebars. Pedaling strenuously on a local street to create airflow over the apparatus, they observed that the third wheel rotated against the airfoil instead of remaining motionless as Lilienthal's formula predicted. The experiment confirmed their suspicion that either the standard Smeaton coefficient or Lilienthal's coefficients of lift and drag–or all of them–were in error.|$|E
