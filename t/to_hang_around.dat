5|$|One night {{towards the}} end of 1942, Gröning and his comrades in their SS barracks on the {{outskirts}} of Birkenau were awakened by an alarm. They were told that a number of Jews who were being taken to the gas chambers had escaped and hidden in the woods. They were ordered to take pistols and search the woods. When his group arrived at the extermination area of the camp they saw a farmhouse, in front of which were SS men and the bodies of seven or eight prisoners who had been caught and shot. The SS men told Gröning and his comrades that they could go home but they decided <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>around</b> {{in the shadows of the}} woods.|$|E

25|$|While {{attending}} Yale University, Cavett {{played in}} and directed dramas {{on the campus}} radio station, WYBC, and appeared in Yale Drama productions. In his senior year, he changed his major from English to drama. He also took advantage of any opportunity to meet stars, routinely going to shows in New York <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>around</b> stage doors or venture backstage. He would {{go so far as}} to carry a copy of Variety or an appropriate piece of company stationery in order to look inconspicuous while sneaking backstage or into a TV studio. Cavett took many odd jobs ranging from store detective to label typist for a Wall Street firm, and as a copyboy at Time Magazine.|$|E
25|$|An informal, {{heuristic}} {{meaning of}} the principle is the following: A state that only exists {{for a short time}} cannot have a definite energy. To have a definite energy, the frequency of the state must be defined accurately, and this requires the state <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>around</b> for many cycles, the reciprocal of the required accuracy. For example, in spectroscopy, excited states have a finite lifetime. By the time–energy uncertainty principle, {{they do not have a}} definite energy, and, each time they decay, the energy they release is slightly different. The average energy of the outgoing photon has a peak at the theoretical energy of the state, but the distribution has a finite width called the natural linewidth. Fast-decaying states have a broad linewidth, while slow decaying states have a narrow linewidth.|$|E
25|$|In 1515, Raphael was {{commissioned}} by Pope Leo X to design a series of ten tapestries <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>around</b> the lower tier of the walls. The tapestries depict events from the Life of St. Peter and the Life of St. Paul, {{the founders of the}} Christian Church in Rome, as described in the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. Work began in mid-1515. Due to their large size, manufacture of the hangings was carried out in Brussels, and took four years under the hands of the weavers in the shop of Pieter van Aelst. Raphael's tapestries were looted during the Sack of Rome in 1527 and were either burnt for their precious metal content or were scattered around Europe. In the late 20th century, a set was reassembled from several further sets that had been made after the first set, and displayed again in the Sistine Chapel in 1983. The tapestries continue in use at occasional ceremonies of particular importance. The full-size preparatory cartoons for seven of the ten tapestries are known as the Raphael Cartoons and are in London.|$|E

[...] "Everybody else would be working and I'd be drawing pictures of Tony Esposito and Jimmy Rutherford," [...] he recalled.

George, India, and Shirley Marte also wrote love songs ("Dejate Amar" [...] and [...] "No Me Conviene") for the album and added India's cover of George Benson's song [...] "I Just Want <b>to</b> <b>Hang</b> <b>Around</b> You" [...] as a counterbalance, in case the feminist songs did not prove popular. When describing the production, India said that [...] "This is me, my flavor in a tropical way, and showing what I can do with my voice."

500|$|Peggy Gallagher {{acquired}} a legal notice of separation {{from her husband}} in 1976. Six years later, she finally left him, taking the three boys with her. As teenagers, the Gallagher brothers (especially Noel) were regular truants, often getting into trouble with the police. When his mother took a job working in the school canteen, Gallagher ensured that he stopped by to visit her during lunch before skipping {{the rest of the}} day.

Gallagher was particularly inspired by the debut of The Smiths on Top of the Pops in 1983, performing their single [...] "This Charming Man".

Hughes started the series with a century (106) in the first Test in Perth and finished the series having scored 193 runs overall. The other touring side that summer were the West Indies, widely considered {{the best team in}} the world at that time and supported by a potent fast bowling attack. The first Test in the series was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Both teams were critical of the pitch prepared at the MCG for the Test. [...] Australia were quickly reduced to 26/4 before Hughes started his effort to recover the Australian innings. Hughes decided to attack the West Indian bowling.

[...] When the ninth wicket fell, Hughes had made 71 and it appeared a century was out of reach. Hughes' remaining batting partner, Alderman, was a poor batsman; it had taken him nine matches to make his first first-class run. Alderman, despite telling Hughes that he didn't give himself much chance, managed to stay with Hughes long enough for Hughes to reach 100 runs. Hughes' innings was widely praised. West Indian Andy Roberts said [...] "He took up the challenge and it paid off for him. It was a great innings. You don't find one batsman playing that sort of innings on more than one occasion.
