5|$|Bach used {{material}} from the chorales in his own composition, for example deriving the first horn motif {{from the beginning of}} the chorale tune of the first chorale. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> that he had chosen the structure before he began the composition.|$|E
5|$|Classic {{learning}} {{theories and}} the modern dual-coding theory support the introduction of interesting, tangential details to learning content. There is evidence that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and is better remembered because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material.|$|E
5|$|Energy {{from the}} Sun should have {{converted}} {{all traces of}} methane in Titan's atmosphere into more complex hydrocarbons within 50 million years—a short time compared {{to the age of}} the Solar System. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> that methane must be replenished by a reservoir on or within Titan itself. The ultimate origin of the methane in its atmosphere may be its interior, released via eruptions from cryovolcanoes.|$|E

5|$|Harvey {{also noted}} that the fatwa covered a wide range of Islamic {{religious}} duties, while usually a responsum fatwa only addresses a specific enquiry on a difficult point of detail. The fatwa also went into specific practical challenges faced by Muslims in Spain, such as the pressure to curse Muhammad, eat pork, drink wine, and intermarry with the Christians. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> that the author had some knowledge of what life under Christian rule was like.|$|E
5|$|In addition, isotopic {{analysis}} of exposed terrestrial rocks has demonstrated the cosmogenic (cosmic ray) production of 21Ne. This isotope {{is generated by}} spallation reactions on magnesium, sodium, silicon, and aluminium. By analyzing all three isotopes, the cosmogenic component can be resolved from magmatic neon and nucleogenic neon. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> that neon will be a useful tool in determining cosmic exposure ages of surface rocks and meteorites.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the colony, the land between Iron Cove and the Cooks River was known as the Kangaroo Ground. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> that the land was open terrain favoured by kangaroos, that they were common in the area and may have formed a {{significant}} part of the Aboriginal diet.|$|E

5|$|It has {{recently}} been determined that the echolocation vocalizations {{do not agree with}} evolutionary relationship between swiftlet species as suggested by DNA sequence comparison. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> that as in bats, echolocation sounds, once present, adapt rapidly and independently to the particular species' acoustic environment.|$|E
5|$|It is {{now clear}} that the common {{ancestor}} of the bony fishes (Osteichthyes) had a primitive air-breathing lung—later evolved into a swim bladder in most actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes). <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> that crossopterygians evolved in warm shallow waters, using their simple lung when the oxygen level in the water became too low.|$|E
5|$|Most {{aftershocks}} {{occurred at}} significantly greater depths than the mainshock and {{are dominated by}} strike-slip focal mechanisms. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> that the mainshock triggered later movement on {{a complex set of}} right and left lateral strike-slip faults within the basement, together accommodating north-south shortening beneath the Hormuz salt layer.|$|E

5|$|Pterobranchs {{may be a}} {{sub-group}} of enteropneusts ("acorn worms"). <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> {{that the}} ancestral deuterostome {{looks more like a}} mobile worm-like enteropneust than a sessile colonial pterobranch. The fact that lophophorates and pterobranchs both use tentacles for feeding is probably not a synapomorphy of lophophorates and deuterostomes, but evolved independently as convergent adaptations to a sessile lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Pushkar Lake's history {{dates back}} to the 4th century BC. Numismatics, in the form of punched Greek and Kushan coins date the lake back to this time. The {{inscriptions}} found at Sanchi attest to the lake's existence to the 2nd Century BC. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> that Pushkar was a pilgrimage centre even if it did not lie on the trade route.|$|E
5|$|The K'iche' conquest {{appears to}} have taken place around AD1000, some four centuries earlier than had been {{supposed}} using calculations based on the indigenous accounts. After the initial arrival of the K'iche' activity continued at the site without pause, and the local styles were simply replaced by styles associated with the conquerors. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> that the original inhabitants abandoned the city they had occupied for almost two millennia.|$|E

5|$|The {{level of}} {{substance}} abuse increases with PMS, mostly with addictive substances such as nicotine, tobacco and cocaine. One theory behind <b>this</b> <b>suggests</b> this higher level {{of substance abuse}} is due to decreased self-control {{as a result of}} the higher metabolic demands during the luteal phase.|$|E
5|$|The various {{formations}} of Siletzia {{are characterized}} as marine tholeiitic pillow basalts and volcanic breccia, often interbedded with sedimentary layers of continental origin, lying on oceanic crust. These are usually capped by {{a layer of}} alkalic volcanics deposited subaerially. All <b>this</b> <b>suggests</b> these formations were initially deposited in an oceanic environment, possibly as seamounts or an island arc.|$|E
5|$|The {{youngest}} of the flows on Axial Seamount are aligned along the two rift zones, followed by flows inside the summit caldera; the oldest appear to originate from directly around the caldera, {{where most of the}} basalt is completely covered in accumulated sediment. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> a bilateral growth pattern, a trend also found in Hawaiian volcanics and other well-known seamounts, for instance Jasper Seamount.|$|E

5|$|A 2011 genetic {{study showed}} that two {{examined}} specimens of the Columbian mammoth were grouped within a subclade of woolly mammoths. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> that the two populations interbred and produced fertile offspring. A North American type formerly referred to as M. jeffersonii may be a hybrid between the two species. A 2015 study suggested that the animals in the range where M. columbi and M. primigenius overlapped formed a metapopulation of hybrids with varying morphology. It also suggested that Eurasian M. primigenius had a similar relationship with M. trogontherii, in areas where their range overlapped.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they lack}} a fovea, some diurnal lemurs have a cone-rich, {{although}} less clustered, area centralis. This area centralis {{has a high}} rod-to-cone cell ratio in many diurnal species studied thus far, whereas diurnal anthropoids have no rod cells in their fovea. Once again, <b>this</b> <b>suggests</b> lower visual acuity in lemurs than in anthropoids. Furthermore, the rod-to-cone cell ratio can be variable even among diurnal species. For instance, Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) and the indri (Indri indri) {{have only a few}} large cones scattered along their predominantly rod-dominated retina. The eyes of the ring-tailed lemur contain one cone to five rods. Nocturnal lemurs such as mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs, on the other hand, have retinas made up entirely of rod cells.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{has also}} revealed two distinct lineages within this species, one occupying the western Atlantic {{and the other}} occupying the eastern Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. <b>This</b> <b>suggests</b> that Indo-Pacific blacktip sharks are descended {{from those in the}} eastern Atlantic, while the western Atlantic sharks became isolated by the widening Atlantic Ocean {{on one side and the}} formation of the Isthmus of Panama on the other. Blacktip sharks from these two regions differ in morphology, coloration, and life history characteristics, and the eastern Atlantic lineage may merit species status. Fossil teeth belonging to this species have been found in Early Miocene (2316 Ma) deposits in Delaware and Florida.|$|E
