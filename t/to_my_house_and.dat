25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

The pair had worked on several other series before The X-Files, and had also contributed the episodes [...] "Conduit", [...] "Ghost in the Machine", [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] and [...] "Lazarus" [...] to the series so far. Series creator Chris Carter recalls being asked to collaborate on the episode, saying [...] "Howard came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house,</b> <b>and</b> said, 'Help me out,' so we went to my living room and put up this bulletin board and {{in a matter of hours}} we came up with this story". Originally the script had called for more overt religious imagery, though censors at Fox objected to depictions of faith healer Samuel being beaten to death whilst in a cruciform pose, leading to scenes being cut.|$|E

Lofton co-wrote the song [...] "What If" [...] on Ruben Studdard's 2006 album Soulful. In 2008, Lofton qualified for the American Century Celebrity Golf Classic.

He {{is reported to have}} said: [...] "It's very easy to sit here, in this room, and say 'racism is horrible'. But ask me the same thing if a Jamaican family moved next door with six children and they play reggae and rock music all day. Or if an estate agent comes <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> tells me that because a Jamaican family has moved next door the value of my property has fallen through the floor.

2500|$|In 1869, Dr. Dio Lewis {{gave the}} lecture in Dover {{that he gave}} three years later in Hillsboro, Ohio, where it {{inspired}} the woman's temperance crusade {{and led to the}} organization of the W. C. T. U. In Dover, a committee of women was appointed, meetings held and saloons visited. Burlingame was a member of this committee, presided at the great mass meetings held, and was offered the leadership of the movement, which she declined. “In June, 1873,” said Burlingame, “Mrs. M. M. H. Hills came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> told me I had been elected president of the Free Baptist W.M.S., just organized at the New Hampshire Yearly Meeting. I at once decided that if president in name, I would be in fact. It had been the custom for women's societies in the denomination to ask a minister to preside, read reports and conduct all public business. I arranged at the first meeting after my election for the women to do their own work. I well remember the first time I presided at the Anniversaries in 1873 at Farmington, N. H." [...] The prominent men, Dr. O. B. Cheney, Rev. Ebenezer Knowlton, who had formerly conducted the exercises for the women, sat in the front pew, ready to grasp the helm should anything go wrong. Ascending the steps to the platform, Burlingame was too abashed to stand behind the pulpit, so she stood beside it. Other officers sustained their parts well. At the close of the exercises Rev. Knowlton came and congratulated her and said, [...] "The brethren will have to look out for their laurels after this.” ...|$|E

50|$|A {{guard of}} rebel {{soldiers}} in 1864 threatened <b>to</b> burn <b>my</b> <b>house,</b> <b>and</b> the rebel soldiers so often threatened <b>to</b> take <b>my</b> life that I cannot particularize. They were always after {{me because of}} my Union sentiments.|$|R
