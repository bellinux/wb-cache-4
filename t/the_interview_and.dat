5|$|Commander George Eyre {{took over}} command of Speedy in February1794. Speedy {{supported}} the siege and capture of Bastia, after which Eyre {{was ordered to}} join Diadem off Nice. While making his way there on 9June, he ran into a French fleet under Rear-Admiral Pierre Martin, which had sailed from Toulon several days earlier. Eyre attempted to escape, but the wind and sea favoured the larger vessels, and Speedy was chased down and captured. Eyre was brought aboard Admiral Martin's flagship {{and was told that}} the National Convention had recently ordered that no quarter should be given to the English or Hanoverians, and that had Martin's ship been first alongside, he would have sunk Speedy. The sudden appearance of a British fleet curtailed <b>the</b> <b>interview,</b> <b>and</b> the French hurried back to Gourjean roadstead outside Toulon, taking Speedy and the captured British crew with them.|$|E

25|$|Redundant Components: Certain components, such as <b>the</b> <b>Interviewing</b> <b>and</b> Advising skill {{assessment}}, {{have been}} criticised as being redundant. <b>The</b> <b>Interviewing</b> <b>and</b> Advising skill assessment creates a highly artificial {{scenario in which}} a trainee solicitor <b>interviews</b> a client <b>and</b> then proceeds to render impromptu legal advice. This is highly unlikely to occur in practice, if at all, but remains a compulsory component of the course due to antiquated SRA requirements.|$|R

5|$|The Survivor Series in November 2003 also {{marked the}} first time Lesnar met Goldberg from the Raw brand. After Lesnar claimed in a {{backstage}} interview that he could beat anybody in the world, Goldberg interrupted <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> <b>and</b> introduced himself to Lesnar, shaking hands with him before leaving with a staredown. Lesnar followed this rivalry with a feud involving Hardcore Holly. In the storyline, Holly wanted revenge on Lesnar for legitimately injuring his neck during a previous match between the two in 2002 which left Holly in need of neck surgery and out of action for a year. At the Royal Rumble on January 25, 2004, Lesnar defeated Holly to retain the WWE Championship. Later in the Royal Rumble match, Lesnar attacked Goldberg and attacked him with an F-5, enabling Kurt Angle to eliminate him.|$|E

Also significant was the researchers’ analysis process, as a researcher with experience in industrial plants held <b>the</b> <b>interviews</b> <b>and</b> visitations.

40|$|Pre-employment {{integrity}} {{testing is}} very widely used. Almost all such testing uses expensive paper-and-pencil forms developed and marketed by proprietary companies. Very {{little research has}} investigated whether pre-employment interviews would be useful for integrity screening. This study investigated two alternate forms of a structured integrity interview. These two forms were compared {{to each other and}} to a paper-and-pencil integrity test. ^ The study employed Rasch model and classical test theory analyses of <b>the</b> <b>interviews,</b> properties, demonstrating that Rasch model analysis provides useful information to guide interview scale revision. In addition, this study compared <b>the</b> <b>interviews</b> <b>and</b> written test to measures of conscientiousness, social desirability, applicant cognitive strategies, perceived fairness, and unobtrusive measures of theft. The study concluded that <b>the</b> <b>interviews</b> <b>and</b> written test reflect a common factor, conscientiousness. In addition, the study noted important differences among the measures in their relationship to social desirability, perceived fairness, attempts to second-guess the purpose of <b>the</b> <b>interviews,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> theft of information. Finally, the study noted limitations to the generalizability of its findings and suggested areas for future research into integrity interview development. ...|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>interview</b> <b>and</b> {{the book}} caused critics to {{accuse him of}} {{hypocrisy}} for having hidden this part of his past, while simultaneously being a strong voice for ethics and morality in the public debate. The book itself was also praised for its depictions of the German postwar generation and the social and moral development of a nation burdened simultaneously by destruction and {{a deep sense of}} guilt. Throughout the memoir Grass plays with the frailty of memory, for which the layers of the onion are a metaphor. Grass second-guesses his own memories, throws his own autobiographical statements into doubt and questions whether the person inhabiting his past was really him. This struggle with memory comes to represent the struggle of the German people during the same period with Germany's Nazi past.|$|E

25|$|In early 1994 Kelvin MacKenzie, {{former editor}} of The Sun newspaper, was {{appointed}} managing director of BSkyB, Sky News's parent company at the time.

The most ferocious battle occurred when Mackenzie wanted Sky News to run an interview with Lady Bienvenida Buck. Frykberg refused to air <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> <b>and</b> resigned shortly afterwards. The interview was broadcast on Sky One.
