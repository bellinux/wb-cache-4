5|$|Due in part {{to these}} {{personal}} trials, he made no momentous contributions to Congress beyond his reliable positions representing Virginia's interests, with a consistent Jeffersonian Republican voting record. He did serve {{as chairman of the}} Committee on Expenditures in the Department of War. There are notable disparities between Tucker's more statist voting record and the nationalism predominant in his writings during this period and later. In his essay On Instructions to Representatives, he provides an explanation in political theory—an inevitable obligation to <b>think</b> <b>one</b> way and yet vote another, in compliance with constituent preferences.|$|E
5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of the greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, {{they tend to be}} totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That to me is the basic issue.|$|E

25|$|Some smaller {{tools were}} made from large flakes that had been struck from stone cores. These flake tools and the {{distinctive}} waste flakes produced in Acheulean tool manufacture suggest a more considered technique, one that required the toolmaker to <b>think</b> <b>one</b> or two steps ahead during work that necessitated a clear sequence of steps to create perhaps several tools in one sitting.|$|E
25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of the things about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic {{within the framework of the}} drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
500|$|Hoping to {{capitalize}} on the parody's success, Yankovic attempted to get a record contract. He and Schwartz quickly began duplicating the original [...] "Another One Rides the Bus" [...] recording on cassettes, and the two then sent them to anyone who might be interested in the spoof.

500|$|During the {{pre-production}} for the episode, {{the cast}} and crew realized that the Halloween conceit would allow the various cast members to wear costumes, rather than their [...] "usual, realistically plain suits". B. J. Novak called the dress-up experience [...] "fun", noting that [...] "seeing the most serious of our plotlines play out alongside such silly and bizarre visuals was, I <b>think,</b> <b>one</b> of the most inspired ideas of the episode's writer, Greg Daniels." [...] The idea for Pam to be dressed as a cat was inspired by several unused stories, created by Gene Stupnitsky, in which [...] "Pam Beesley must disguise herself as a cat". The plot lines were vetoed by the shows writers, but Stupnitsky successfully petitioned to allow Pam to wear a cat costume.|$|E

Although the songs share common themes, Radiohead did not consider OK Computer a concept album and {{said they had no}} intention to link the songs with an underlying narrative; Jonny Greenwood said [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> album title and one computer voice do not make a concept album. That's a bit of a red herring." [...] However, the band intended the album to be heard as a whole, and spent two weeks creating the track list. O'Brien said: [...] "The context of each song is really important... It's not a concept album but there is a continuity there." ...|$|E

500|$|The Battersea Power Station Community Group <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of {{the main}} reasons for the power station's {{worldwide}} recognition is that it appeared on the cover of Pink Floyd's 1977 album Animals, on which it was photographed with the group's inflatable pink pig floating above it. The photographs were taken in early December 1976 and the inflatable pig was made by the German company Ballon Fabrik and Australian artist Jeffrey Shaw. The inflatable pig was tethered to one of the power station's southern chimneys, but broke loose from its moorings and, to the astonishment of pilots in approaching planes, drifted into the flight path of Heathrow Airport. Police helicopters tracked its course, until it landed in Kent. Video footage of the photoshoot was used in the promotional video for the song [...] "Pigs on the Wing". The album was officially launched at an event at the power station.|$|E
500|$|Although Scott had {{accepted}} the job Demme had rejected, he said: [...] "My first question was: 'What about Jonathan?' and they said: 'The original team said it's too violent.' I said, 'Okay. I'll do it.'" [...] Scott did, himself, have some uncertainty with the source material. In particular, he had difficulties with {{the ending of the}} novel, in which Lecter and Starling become lovers: [...] "I couldn't take that quantum leap emotionally on behalf of Starling. Certainly, on behalf of Hannibal—I'm sure that's been {{in the back of his}} mind for a number of years. But for Starling, no. I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of the attractions about Starling to Hannibal is what a straight arrow she is." [...] He also [...] "didn't buy the book from the opera scene onwards, which became like a vampire movie." [...] He asked Harris if he was [...] "married to his ending". Harris said he was not, so Scott changed it.|$|E
500|$|Author Gary Tillery draws {{parallels}} between Harrison's approach to [...] " [...] {{through the motions}} of living in the material world" [...] and the way someone in the 21st century might play a virtual reality game. Tillery writes that [...] "what we see and experience during the game is actually an illusion" [...] – or maya in the Hindu belief to which Harrison subscribed – and that [...] "hat does matter in the great scheme of things is to wake up from the dreamlike state we mistake for reality." [...] Speaking at a 1974 press conference, in reply to whether there was a [...] "paradox" [...] between his spiritualism and the lifestyle of a musician, Harrison conceded: [...] "It is difficult... You can go to the Himalayas and miss it completely and [...] be stuck in the middle of New York and be very spiritual... I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> by one we all free ourselves from the chains that we have chained ourselves to, whatever we're chained to." ...|$|E

500|$|Leigh's death {{received}} {{widespread and}} ongoing coverage {{in both the}} Sydney and Newcastle media, possibly due to a fascination with her reduplicated name. Between 1989 and 1994, The Newcastle Herald ran at least 39 stories on Leigh, 23 of them featured on the front page. At least ten articles on the case were published in The Sydney Morning Herald during the same period. Both the extended media coverage and the theatrical plays and film the murder inspired have led to it being termed a [...] "celebrity crime", and to Leigh being {{referred to as a}} [...] "celebrity victim". In 1996 Psychologist Roger Peters attributed the media fascination to the sense of community in Stockton, and due to the crimes being committed by people not considered to be typical criminals, [...] stating [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of the main things is that people can identify with people involved. Had it of been a criminal from outside who stalked her and killed I think it would be long forgotten." ...|$|E
500|$|Miller was {{recommended}} for Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers by Blakey members Terence Blanchard and Donald Harrison, {{and he joined}} the drummer's band in 1983. Initially, he struggled {{to fit in with}} Blakey dominating the rhythm section, but Miller stated that, over his period with the band, [...] "My playing just generally matured. I don't <b>think</b> <b>one</b> single characteristic changed, but the experience certainly boosted my confidence". At times during concert performances he was allotted a solo piano spot, which Miller used to play medleys. His presence in the Jazz Messengers cemented his reputation within jazz. His recording career as a leader began in 1985, with Keys to the City, the first of Miller's several recordings for Landmark Records, which continued with Work! the following year. Jon Pareles' review of a solo concert in 1986 noted that Miller's playing showed the influence of Powell on some numbers and Kelly on others, but that, overall, he was developing [...] "his own, authoritative style".|$|E
500|$|Not surprisingly, Quentin Tarantino {{has lately}} {{become the focus}} {{for this sort of}} {{criticism}} (about the relationship between the movies and acts of violence). The fact that Django Unchained arrived in theaters right {{around the time of the}} Sandy Hook massacre didn't help. Yet he has refused to give an inch in discussing the link between movie violence and real life. Obviously I don't <b>think</b> <b>one</b> has to do with the other. Movies are about make-believe. It's about imagination. Part of the thing is trying to create a realistic experience, but we are faking it. Is it possible that anyone in our cynical world credits a self-serving sophistry like this? Of course an industry under fire will claim that its hands are clean, just as the NRA has done – and of course a favorite son, be it Tarantino or LaPierre, can be counted on to make the claim louder than anyone else. But do they really believe that imaginative expression is without consequence? ...|$|E
