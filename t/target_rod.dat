Both nondestructive and destructive post-irradiation examination on all eleven rods was planned under the Tritium Target Development Program. Funding for the program was reduced in 1991 resulting in the early removal of the program experiments before reaching their irradiation goals. Post-irradiation examination was only performed on one of the irradiated rods at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory before the program was terminated in 1992. On December 6, 1995, the Secretary of Energy announced the pursuit of the Commercial Light-Water Reactor option for producing tritium establishing the Tritium Target Qualification Program at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. This program decided to pursue nondestructive and destructive post-irradiation examination of the ten remaining rods from the previous program. The ten rods comprise three experiments.

In several decades of research, the link between the increase in photoreceptor cGMP levels and the extremely rapid cell death gave rise to a number of hypotheses. Here, we provide clear evidence that the presence of cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG) channels in the outer segment membrane is the key to rod photoreceptor loss. In Cngb 1 (-/-) × rd 1 double mutants devoid of regular CNG channels, cGMP levels are still pathologically high, but rod photoreceptor viability and outer segment morphology are greatly improved. Importantly, cone photoreceptors, the basis for high-resolution daylight and colour vision, survived and remained functional for extended periods of time. These findings strongly support the hypothesis of deleterious calcium (Ca(2 +)) -influx as the cause of rapid rod cell death and highlight the importance of CNG channels in this process.

A 2 mm rms beam spot with power deposition of over 18 KW presents challenging material and engineering solutions to this project. Given that the amount of heat transferred by radiation alone from the target to the horn is quite small, the primary mechanism is heat removal by forced convection in the annular space between the target and the horn. The key elements are the operating temperature of the target, the temperature of the cooling fluid and the heat generation rate in the volume of the target that needs to be removed. These working parameters establish the mass flow rate and velocity of the coolant necessary to remove the generated heat. Several cooling options were explored using a carbon-carbon target and aluminum horn. Detailed analysis, trade studies and simulations were performed for cooling the horn and target with gaseous helium as well as water. flowing in the annular space, the bulk of the heat generated in the conductor by the electric current is to be removed by the spraying of water through a set of optimally positioned jets.

40|$|Quantitative {{measurements}} in PET imaging {{have recently}} become more widespread {{as a way}} to diagnose and stage many types of malignant cancer. Currently patients need to have follow-up scans performed on the same PET system due to technical factors. Multi-clinic studies using quantitative PET measurements are also confounded by these technological factors. This work aims to evaluate the use of commonly available phantoms to cross-calibrate processing parameters to equalize small lesion quantitation. The method was verified using an abdomen phantom with small hot sphere inserts, as well as a smaller phantom with small hot sphere inserts. Methods: A GE Discovery 690 and STE were used. Both time-of-flight (TOF) and non-TOF images were used from the D 690. Jaszczak phantoms with hot rod and cold rod inserts were scanned on both systems consecutively for 20 minutes. Images were reconstructed with a range of iterations and post-smoothed (PS) with 2 - 10 mm of smoothing. Automated analysis of the images used the CT images to find rods and then calculate a rod to background ratio for each rod sector, PET image variant, and scanner. A <b>target</b> <b>rod</b> contrast could then be chosen and parameters determined for both systems separately to equalize rod contrast. Iteration-based resolution control and PS were both evaluated. To verify, an abdomen phantom was filled with a low background activity and ten 10 -mm diameter spheres filled with FDG and CT contrast. In order to evaluate any size dependence, six 10 -mm diameter spheres filled with FDG and CT contrast were placed inside a Jaszczak container filled with low background activity. An automatic CT-based analysis of the spheres was performed, obtaining mean and maximum values across the spheres. Results: Small sphere quantitation differed substantially for similar processing between systems. However, sphere quantitation matched well when cross-calibrating the DSTE and non-TOF D 690 Jaszczak phantom images by independently limiting iterations. Doing the same process with post-smoothing yielded similar results, with high iteration PS performing slightly better than PS at iterations used clinically at Duke for twenty-minute scans. Equalizing TOF images from the D 690 with DSTE images with spheres placed in an abdomen phantom resulted in relatively poor correlation, but correlated well with spheres placed inside the Jaszczak phantom. Shorter scan durations behaved similarly to the twenty-minute scans. Conclusions: Both Jaszczak phantoms worked well for cross-calibrating processing parameters to equalize quantitation in small lesions for non-TOF imaging. Iterations and PS could both be used to control resolution. It appears the best method is to use PS to fine-tune the resolution. The size dependence of TOF, and PET in general, seems to be an issue.

Figure 1 shows the graphite <b>target</b> <b>rod</b> supported by graphite spokes, which are mounted to a water-cooled stainless steel support tube. The target is radiatively cooled to the water-cooled surface of the support tube. Based on nuclear analysis results (Ref. 2), the time-averaged power deposition in the target is 35 kW. If this power is deposited uniformly along the axial length of the target, the volumetric power deposition in the target is about 250 MW/m{sup 3 }. The target surface temperature required to radiate the deposited power to a water-cooled tube {{is estimated to be}} about 1850 C, and the temperature {{at the center of the}} target is about 75 C hotter. The sublimation erosion rate (e), estimated assuming that the graphite is submersed in a perfect vacuum environment, can be derived from kinetic theory and is given by: e = p{sub sat} (m/ 2 {pi} kT) {sup 1 / 2 } where p{sub sat} is the saturation pressure, m is the molecular weight, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature. The saturation pressure given in Ref. 3 can be approximated by: p{sub sat} = exp(-A/T + B) where A = 9. 47 x 10 {sup 3 }, B = 24. 2, and the units of p{sub sat} and T are atmospheres and K, respectively. Using these equations, the saturation pressure and sublimation erosion rate are plotted in Fig. 2 as a function of temperature. The surface recession rate shown with units of mm/s in Fig. 2 assumes one-sided erosion. At the average power deposition value of 250 MW/m{sup 3 }, the surface temperature is 1850 C resulting in a sublimation erosion rate of only 2. 2 mm/day. However, if the actual power deposition were peaked by a factor of two in the axial direction, then the surface temperature would be 2260 C and the surface recession rate would be 2. 8 mm/day, which is clearly unacceptable. To establish the viability of a graphite target at the reference power levels and perhaps extend the power handling performance of radiatively cooled graphite targets, a helium cover gas at nominally one atmosphere pressure was proposed as a means to greatly reduce the net erosion rate. The mean free path for a graphite atom in a helium environment at a pressure of one atmosphere is less than 0. 1 mm, which means that graphite that is sublimated from the target surface will travel on average less than 0. 1 mm before it interacts with the helium. Given this small mean-free-path, it can be expected that a large fraction of the graphite that is sublimated will find its way back to the graphite surface and re-condense on the target, thereby greatly reducing the net erosion rate. The primary purposes for performing the tests described in this report are to (1) verify that we can reproduce the sublimation erosion rate expected for high vacuum conditions and (2) establish the reduction in net sublimation of graphite as a function of the gas (He) pressure in a chamber that roughly simulates the stainless steel support tube discussed above. Thus far, the first objective has been accomplished, but more work is required to accomplish the second. The experimental apparatus is described in Section 2 of this report and results obtained thus far are presented in Section 3 of this report...|$|E
40|$|OAK-B 135 This {{project was}} {{undertaken}} to enhance our understanding {{and control of}} the response of ductile materials to extreme loading conditions such as those involved in impact loading. The project was designed with a focus on the role of friction in high rate deformation and shock studies. The work involves collaboration of the tribology group in Materials Science and Engineering at OSU and two groups at LANL, an impact loading group in the dynamic experimentation division and a computer simulation group in the applied physics division. The two teams are investigating the same materials pairs: Cu/Cu, Al/stainless steel (SS) and Ta/Al. The LANL team is providing impacted specimens for characterization at OS U. The LANL team has designed and built a rotating barrel gas gun apparatus that allows measurement of frictional force at an impacted interface over time scales of 0 to 50 {micro}s. Impact pressures are 0 - 150 MPa and sliding speeds can be up to 50 m/s. The stainless steel barrel can rotate at rates from 0 - 5000 rpm. An impactor rod is driven at up to 12 m/s against a <b>target</b> <b>rod</b> of the specimen material. Initial tests have been with OFHC Cu/Cu annealed to relax strains from the machining process. The grains are equiaxed and have 40 {micro}m grain size. In the velocity range 0 - 6 m/s, the friction force increases with velocity for time scales of order 25 {micro}s. The LANL team has also performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of sliding for Cu/Cu and Al/Ta using embedded atom potentials as well as simpler systems using Lennard-Jones potentials (also used at OSU). The results show extensive plastic deformation and, in some cases, the formation of nanocrystals at the sliding interface. The dependence of friction force on sliding velocity, v, shows two regimes: a low speed regime in which friction force rises with v and a high speed regime in which it decreases. The experimental work at OSU has focused on three tasks: (1) designing and building an improved system for sliding tests at intermediate velocities, (2) developing appropriate pre-testing surface preparation and (3) developing post-test characterization techniques. The new pin/disk wear testing system can achieve sliding speeds up to 1 m/s in a range of environments and contact times as small as 0. 1 s. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was done on cross-sections of the as-machined annular OFHC copper samples. This revealed substructures consistent with extensive subsurface. These features would complicate our efforts to study the changes produced by impact with sliding. The samples should have a minimal amount of subsurface deformation prior to testing, so the deformation due to sliding will not be obscured. Therefore, a study was conducted to find a test specimen preparation method that would minimize subsurface deformation. Three machining methods were analyzed: lathe turning, fly-cutting, and electrical discharge machining (EDM). Post-machining annealing at 275 C for one hour in a vacuum furnace was also performed to remove deformation remaining from the machining processes. Microhardness was measured {{as a function of the}} distance from the machined surface. This was a simple way to determine the extent of subsurface deformation. The results show that annealed fly-cut samples are best for our purposes. Similar tests on pure aluminum samples suggest that annealing of fly-cut samples at 200 C for an hour is sufficient to remove subsurface deformation. The material tested at OSU was characterized using optical microscopy, SEM and TEM. Wear tracks and wear debris were analyzed using SEM and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). TEM samples were prepared using different techniques including dimpling, jet-polishing and chemical polishing. Innovative techniques involving a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) have also been explored. MD modeling at OSU has focused on simple amorphous materials. The results suggest that the flow of material close to the sliding interface is characterized by the formation of eddies, intimate mixing and ''diffusion-like'' growth of the mixed layer. When the sliding speed is sufficiently high, the strain rate allows vorticity to develop. A comparison of eddy sizes with nanocrystal sizes in actual tribomaterial suggests that vorticity is directly responsible for the formation of such nanocrystal material. It is suggested that the flow of material near the interface is similar to turbulent flow in fluids. The resulting eddies affects frictional energy dissipation and mechanical mixing. A mixing-layer model of turbulent flow is qualitatively consistent with velocity profiles and friction behavior revealed by MD simulations...|$|E

Davis and McCosker again made solid starts, scoring 26 and 46 respectively, but it was Kim Hughes (51), and Doug Walters (52 not out) that took the game away from Gloucestershire. Hughes fell as the <b>target</b> approached, but <b>Rod</b> Marsh came in with only four runs required for victory, and over eight overs still spare. Only Robinson out for 10, really disappointed, as Australia won comfortably by 6 wickets.|$|R
50|$|The typical {{depiction}} of the tactic is of a satellite containing a magazine of tungsten rods and a directional thrust system. When a strike is ordered, the satellite would brake one of the rods out of its orbit and into a suborbital trajectory that intersects the <b>target.</b> As the <b>rod</b> approaches periapsis and the target due to gravity, it picks up immense speed until it begins decelerating in the atmosphere and reaches terminal velocity shortly before impact. The rods would typically be shaped to minimize air resistance and maximize terminal velocity. In science fiction, the weapon is often depicted as being launched from a spaceship, instead of a satellite.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the rapid rise time of x-ray emission from targets heated by an ultrashort-pulse high-intensity optical laser was conducted {{for use as a}} pump for inner-shell photo-ionized x-ray lasing. Results of x-ray rise times from instantaneously heated Au <b>rod</b> <b>targets</b> show little benefit for using optical pulse widths less than 30 fs. Gain calculations for inner-shell photo-ionized lasing show that large gains can be obtained for pulse widths between 30 and 100 fs. Calculated spectra, using the hydrodynamic/atomic kinetics code LASNEX, from a 1 J, 65 fs FWHM pulse optical laser incident on a structured Au target gave a gain of 1 1. 5 cm{sup {minus} 1 } in C at 45 {angstrom}...|$|R
40|$|AIMS—Nasal {{tolerance}} induction with autoantigens {{can effectively}} protect against {{a variety of}} experimental models of autoimmune disease. The aims {{of this study were}} to characterise the dosage and kinetics of inhibition of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) via intranasal administration of the uveitogenic antigen interphotoreceptor retinal binding protein (IRBP) in the murine model of IRBP induced EAU.  METHODS—B 10 RIII mice were tolerised by intranasal administration of IRBP either with a long term multiple low dose or a short term/high dosing regimen before subcutaneous immunisation with IRBP in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). On day 15  post-immunisation, mice were killed and eyes were removed for histological examination and quantification of inflammatory cell infiltration and degree of <b>target</b> organ (<b>rod</b> outer segment, ROS) destruction.  RESULTS—Nasal administration of multiple low doses of IRBP (1  µg or 3  µg IRBP per mouse per day for 10  days) significantly protected mice from IRBP induced EAU. Short term/high dose regimens were only effective when given either as a single or, at most, as two consecutive doses (40  µg per dose). Multiple doses in the range of 45 - 120 µg over 3  days afforded no protection.  CONCLUSIONS—These results indicate that both dose and frequency of intranasal antigen administration are pivotal to tolerance induction and subsequent suppression of T cell mediated autoimmune disease. ...|$|R
