40|$|Theme: This Paper {{looks at}} the UK’s {{domestic}} intelligence system’s response to 9 / 11 and offers some preliminary comments on {{the implications of the}} 7 / 7 attacks in London. Summary: This paper discusses intelligence and domestic counter-terrorism in the UK, post 9 / 11, with an emphasis on intelligence-led counter-terrorism. It also offers a <b>tentative,</b> initial <b>analysis</b> of the implications of the 7 July London bombings, where there is a presumption of a lack of prior intelligence. Analysis: Introduction The significance of intelligence in counter-terrorism stems from three main drivers: (1) its role in pre-emption and disruption of terrorist activity; (2) its role in post-incident investigations; and (3) its contribution to preventive/protective security measures. This discussion will focus mainly on intelligence and domestic counter-terrorism in the UK, post 9 / 11, where the emphasis is on intelligence-led counter-terrorism. The paper also offers a <b>tentative,</b> initial <b>analysis</b> of the implications of the London bombings of 7 July 2005 where there is a presumption of a lack of prior intelligence. The paper will not consider the intense UK debate about intelligence and the evidence for an Iraqi WMD programme, as that has limited relevance to a discussion on intelligence relating to terrorist suspects or facilities within UK national territory because these can be subjected to direct surveillance and investigative actions...|$|R

The strata observed in the shelf deposits of the Doushantuo Formation are organised in three stacked facies successions. These shallowingupward facies successions may be correlatable with other Ediacaran sections worldwide. © 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Small and {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) are often credited with innovative entrepreneurial practices and conceiving new market opportunities. Government has reinforced these positive economic externalities through policy programmes and designated support structures. Venture capital organisations often galvanise innovative knowledge by entrenching and sustaining nascent businesses through value-creating funding behaviours. In this way, {{the venture capital}} industry financially supports entrepreneurial activity for economic growth and governs and nurtures {{the growth of the}} SMEs. These show that the venture capital industry embraces value-creating opportunities on the basis of rational partnerships with enterprises that have limited track records and less formal control mechanisms.   The <b>tentative</b> factor <b>analysis</b> findings suggest an integrated framework for the venture capital industry from the significant intercorrelations among the variables.

40|$|Abstract. Biomass burning has {{important}} impacts on atmospheric chemistry and climate. Fires in tropical forests and savannas release {{large quantities of}} trace gases and particulate matter. Com-bustion of biofuels for cooking and heating constitutes a less spectacular but similarly widespread biomass burning activity. To provide {{the groundwork for a}} quantification of this source, we de-termined in rural Zimbabwe the emissions of CO 2, CO, and NO from more than 100 domestic fires fueled by wood, agricultural residues, and dung. The results indicate that, compared to open savanna fires, emissions from domestic fires are shifted towards products of incomplete combustion. A <b>tentative</b> global <b>analysis</b> shows that the source strength of domestic biomass burning is on the order of 1500 Tg CO 2 –C yr− 1, 140 Tg CO–C yr− 1, and 2. 5 Tg NO–N yr− 1.

40|$|The {{results of}} using data envelopment {{analysis}} (DEA) to assess the relative efficiency of 45 Canadian universities are reported. Outcomes are obtained from nine different specifications of inputs and outputs. The relative efficiencies are quite consistent across the alternative specifications. A subset of universities - including universities from each of three categories (comprehensive with medical school, comprehensive without medical school, and primarily undergraduate) - are regularly found efficient and a subset quite inefficient but, overall and for most universities, the efficiency scores are relatively high. Simulation of the recent 20 -percent cut in provincial grants to the Alberta universities illustrates how potential efficiency improvements (as implied and measured by this methodology) might be realized but it also illustrates certain limitations. Regression analysis is used {{in an effort to}} identify further determinants of efficiency. While there are limitations to the methodology and the available (especially output) measures which makes the specific efficiency outcomes <b>tentative,</b> this <b>analysis</b> provides insight to university productivity in Canada and its analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|Conceptual metaphor theory (CMT) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prolific}} frameworks in the study of emotion concepts. Following the seminal work of Lakoff and Johnson (1980) and subsequent work by Kövecses (1986, 1990) and Kövecses and Lakoff (1987), an impressive number of studies in cognitive linguistics and psycholinguistics have sought to document and confirm the claim that conceptual metaphor (CM) structures affective concepts. I attempt a brief overview of CMT claims about and CMT-inspired research on emotion concepts. I continue by presenting a study based on data collected in six languages, to assess the role of CM in the structuring of emotion concepts.

40|$|Background: Active {{and passive}} {{immunotherapy}} in both amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients {{have resulted in}} remarkable reductions in amyloid plaque accumulation, although the degree of amyloid regression has been highly variable. Nine individuals with a clinical diagnosis of AD dementia were actively immunized with the Ab peptide 1 - 42 (AN- 1792) and subjected to detailed postmortem biochemical analyses. These patients were compared to 6 non-immunized AD cases and 5 non-demented control (NDC) cases. Results: All patients were assessed {{for the presence of}} AD pathology including amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and vascular amyloidosis. This effort revealed that two immunotherapy recipients had dementia as a consequence of diseases other than AD. Direct neuropathological examination consistently demonstrated small to extensive areas in which amyloid plaques apparently were disrupted. Characterization of Ab species remnants by ELISA suggested that total Ab levels may have been reduced, although because the amounts of Ab peptides among treated individuals were extremely variable, those data must be regarded as <b>tentative.</b> Chromatographic <b>analysis</b> and Western blots revealed abundant dimeric Ab peptides.

40|$|Abstract: Problem Statement: In {{many cases}} {{it would be}} helpful to include already {{existing}} data with the GIS for interpretation of remote sensing data. Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) is a technology for image analysis which addresses exactly those problems hampering a successful bridging of Remote Sensing and GIS. In order to provide potential strategies to meet the proposed objective, a <b>tentative</b> SWOT <b>Analysis</b> is undertaken to identify current Strengths, Weakness, Opportunities and Threats that OBIA faces. Approach: Two different areas had been chosen for testing. The results of pixel based and polygon-based classification has been compared. Results: The classified image derived from polygon based classification is closer to human visual Interpretation. Finally, it is understood that using the e-cognition technique, the weaknesses and threats that OBIA originally suffered are minimized to a great extent. Conclusions: Pixel based classification uses the pure spectral information only. Beyond the pure spectral information, OBIA uses local context information also. This often essential information can be used together with form and texture features of image objects to improve classification significantly. Key words: Object based image analysis, hierarchical network of image objects, semantic networks, image segmentatio...|$|R

40|$|In 2008, it {{was widely}} {{announced}} that the missing memristor, a basic two-terminal electrical circuit element, had finally been discovered. The memristor is the fourth and last such circuit element and thus completes circuit theory. Predicted already in 1971, the eventual discovery of something seemingly so basic needed almost 40 years. However, this discovery is doubted. The predicted memristor has no material memory {{and is based on}} magnetic flux, but the discovered devices constitute analogue memory storage that do not involve magnetism. The person who originally proposed the memristor did not reject the discovery but instead changed his mind about what a memristor is. We briefly introduce the history and then carefully memristance and the memristor as such. We discuss its status as a model rather than a device. We discuss the discovered devices, their stability, and how stability relates to the consistency of the theoretical entities. A thought experiment assumes a world without magnetism. Inductors cannot exist there, but memory resistors could still be constructed. On the same grounds as the memristor was historically predicted, an "inductor" could then be predicted. Likely, somebody would also 'discover' one. A <b>tentative</b> sociological <b>analysis</b> compares to the flawed detection of gravitational waves but comes to very different conclusions.

40|$|The {{imperfect}} subjunctive form –ra {{found in}} the variety of Spanish spoken between the Eo and Navia rivers in Asturias, has not only the modal value observed in Standard Peninsular Spanish (Ojalá lloviera ‘I wish it rained’), {{but it may also}} carry temporal values such as pluperfect (Cuando llegué yo, Ana ya saliera ‘by the time I arrived, Ana had already left’) and simple past ((Las flores) me las regalara mi abuela ‘(the flowers) my grandmother gave them to me’). This paper offers a (<b>tentative)</b> formal <b>analysis</b> of the licensing conditions of –ra in affirmative contexts in this variety, using the nanosyntactic apparatus (Starke 2005). The hypothesis based on features is presented in combination with Ojea’s (2005) work on asertiveness and mood selection: two main factors, one syntactic (subordination) and one semantic (level of assertiveness), are examined to identify the number and order of features, as well as their semantic value (modal, pluperfect, and deictic). Evidence from spontaneous speech as well as data from an online survey completed by 45 Eonavians conform the empirical basis of the study. The analysis predicts that the difference between Standard and Eonavian Spanish follows from the number of features that –ra lexicalizes in each variety, as illustrated in concrete example...|$|R
40|$|U. S. {{universities}} and academic medical centers long {{have been important}} performers {{of research in the}} life sciences, but their role as a source of patented intellectual property in this field has changed significantly in the late 20 th and early 21 st centuries. The expanded presence of formal intellectual property rights within the academic biomedical research enterprise has occasioned numerous expressions of concern from scholars, policymakers, and participants. One widely expressed fear involves the effects of patenting on the conduct of the scientific research enterprise. There is also considerable concern over the possible role of Materials Transfer Agreements (MTAs) in raising research “transaction costs”. On the other hand, others suggest that the contractual structure provided by MTAs may reduce transaction costs and facilitate exchange. This paper undertakes a preliminary analysis of the role of MTAs in the biomedical research enterprise at the University of Michigan, a significant patenter and licensor of biomedical intellectual property. We examine the relationship among invention disclosures, patenting, licensing, and {{the presence or absence of}} an MTA. Although data limitations make any conclusions <b>tentative,</b> our <b>analysis</b> suggests that the increased assertion of property rights by universities through MTAs does not appear to impede the commercialization of university research through patenting and licensing.
