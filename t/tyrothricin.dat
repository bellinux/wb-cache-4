50|$|In 1939, the American {{microbiologist}} René Dubos {{discovered the}} soil microbe Bacillus brevis. He observed {{the ability of}} the microbe to decompose the capsule of pneumococcus bacterium, rendering it harmless. From the soil microbe B. brevis, he isolated <b>tyrothricin,</b> which had a high toxicity to a large range of bacteria. <b>Tyrothricin</b> was later found to be a mixture of the peptides gramicidin and tyrocidine. These were observed to have toxic effects in red blood cells and reproductive cells in humans, however, if applied externally as an ointment tyrocidine could also be used as a potent antimicrobial agent.Dubos's discovery helped revive interest in research on penicillin.|$|E

He completed a thesis he described as [...] "replicating American work" [...] {{on the effectiveness of}} the antibiotic against local infections, and became a medical doctor in 1947. Though attracted to research as a career, he was discouraged by his own perceived ignorance after attending a microbiology congress that summer. Instead he took a position at the Cabanel Center, where he had done his thesis research; his new work entailed the manufacture of antibiotic, <b>tyrothricin.</b> Later, the center was contracted to convert gunpowder factories for penicillin production (though this proved impossible).|$|E

50|$|Florey {{credited}} Rene Dubos with pioneering {{the approach}} of deliberately and systematically searching for antibacterial compounds, which had led {{to the discovery of}} gramicidin and had revived Florey's research in penicillin. In 1939, coinciding with the start of World War II, Dubos had reported the discovery of the first naturally derived antibiotic, <b>tyrothricin,</b> a compound of 20% gramicidin and 80% tyrocidine, from B. brevis. It {{was one of the first}} commercially manufactured antibiotics and was very effective in treating wounds and ulcers during World War II. Gramicidin, however, could not be used systemically because of toxicity. Tyrocidine also proved too toxic for systemic usage. Research results obtained during that period were not shared between the Axis and the Allied powers during World War II and limited access during the Cold War.|$|E
50|$|Dubos {{was born}} in Saint-Brice-sous-Forêt, France, on February 20, 1901, {{and grew up in}} Hénonville, another small Île-de-France farming village north of Paris. His parents {{operated}} butcher shops in each of these villages. He attended high school and the National Institute of Agronomy in Paris, and he received a Ph.D. from Rutgers University in 1927. Dubos began his career in microbiology in 1927, when he joined Oswald Avery's laboratory at The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. Avery was looking for a microbe that could break down the polysaccharide capsule of a deadly strain of bacterial pneumonia {{in the same way that}} soil bacteria digested decaying organic matter in the woods. Dubos identified a bacterium that secreted an enzyme that broke down polysaccharide. In 1939, with the help of Rockefeller Institute biochemist Rollin Hotchkiss, Dubos isolated the antibacterial agents <b>tyrothricin</b> and gramicidin from the bacterium Bacillus brevis that killed or inhibited Gram-positive bacteria and tested their bacterial, chemical, and clinical properties. These antibiotics remain in limited use today. In 1942, before antibiotics were in general use, Dubos warned that bacterial resistance should be expected.|$|E

40|$|Part II of thesis by Brancato, Noyes, and Swift. Part I of thesis by Swift. Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{antibacterial}} {{effect of}} saliva {{has been known}} for many years. Still the exact nature of the antagonistic action of saliva upon bacteria is as yet unsettled. Most workers agree, however, that the salivary bacterial inhibitory action is brought about in at least six ways: The first antibacterial effect is changes in pH, which affect the growth of oral organisms. Furthermore, this change in pH is dependent on diet and on the type of organisms in the oral cavity. The second is the mechanical factors involved, for saliva not only flushes bacteria from the mouth, but dilutes the number of organisms as well. The third is the antibacterial action of the cellular components in saliva. The leukocytes in saliva have a phagocytic action, and the non-phagocytic epithelial cells slough off in sheets, carrying with them thousands of organisms which have lodged in the partially turned edges of the necrotic cells. The fourth antibacterial action is ascribed to the presence of immune bodies in the saliva which lyse or agglutinate the oral bacteria. The fifth is the presence of oral bacteria which are antagonistic to new invaders. And the sixth is the presence of enzymes that lyse some oral bacteria or alter their cell membranes thereby inhibiting further growth. In recent years a great deal of investigation has been made to ascribe the enzymatic effect as the chief antibacterial agent in saliva; however, contradictory work has been done to try to attribute the chief antibacterial action of salivary cocci. Indeed the antibacterial effect of saliva is not always present, for the bacteriostatic effect of saliva is variable from day to day and from individual to individual. The only way of reducing the number of oral bacteria is to add to the saliva an antibiotic. <b>Tyrothricin</b> was used. In an attempt to delineate the range of concentration of <b>tyrothricin</b> per ml. effective against the New York 5 strain of Streptococcus pryogenes in saliva, this experiment was carried out. It was molded after the unpublished work of Belding concerning the effect of <b>tyrothricin</b> on the Oxford Strain of Staphylococcus aureus in saliva. The required inoculum of approximately one million organisms per ml was obtained by growing cultures of the streptococci under uniform conditions and setting up a table of the absorbances and viable cell counts, from which dilution factors for further cultures could be estimated. Controls were set up for determining possible inhibition of <b>tyrothricin</b> and/or test organisms by the various diluting fluids including saliva. Final concentrations per ml of 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 µg of <b>tyrothricin</b> integrated with saliva and an approximated number of streptococci were plated out after 30 and 60 minutes exposure periods and were counted after 24 and 48 hours of incubation at 37 °C. Whereas 1 µg per ml of <b>tyrothricin</b> reduced markedly the number of streptococci suspended in water during a 30 minute exposure period and 10 µg per ml, under similar conditions, caused complete inhibition, 10 µg per ml of the antibiotic was ineffective against this test organism suspended in saliva during a 30 minute exposure period but caused about an 80 per cent reduction in viable organisms during 60 minutes exposure. The length of the exposure period necessary for effective inhibition varied inversely with the concentration of <b>tyrothricin</b> per ml, 100 µg per ml causing a 98 per cent reduction of viable organisms during an exposure period of 1 minute. For the 30 minute exposure period, the quantity of <b>tyrothricin</b> effective against this strain of streptococci mixed in saliva would fall in the 10 µg - 25 µg per ml range and for shorter exposure periods, the concentration per ml would have to be greater. Cultures completely negative during 24 hours incubation at 37 °C, showed a typical growth during 48 hours. This is considered indicative of the bacteriostatic action of <b>tyrothricin</b> which, prolonged, resulted in the death of large numbers of the streptococci. The results which were obtained in these experiments serve chiefly to point out the way for further work and to form a basis for the general conclusions listed below: 1. The action of <b>tyrothricin</b> on bacteria is inhibited by saliva to a large degree. 2. The minimal amounts of <b>tyrothricin</b> necessary to produce complete inhibition of growth of Streptococcus pyogenes in saliva is between 25 and 50 µg per ml acting for 30 minutes. 3. There is an effective reduction of Streptococcus pyogenes in saliva by concentrations of <b>tyrothricin</b> between 10 and 25 µg per ml acting for 30 minutes. 4. <b>Tyrothricin</b> acts immediately upon contact with Streptococcus pyogenes. 5. The action of <b>tyrothricin</b> on Streptococcus pyogenes in saliva is apparently bacteriostatic and not of a permanent nature as manifested by growth of atypical colonies during 48 hours incubation. 6. <b>Tyrothricin</b> above a concentration of 50 µg per ml had a definite reducing effect on the bacterial population of this saliva. 7. Saliva also has a bactericidal or bacteriostatic (or both) action against Streptococcus pyogenes...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tyrothricin,</b> {{discovered}} by Dubos, is an anti-biotic product of Bacillus brevis. Its antibacterial action against {{a wide variety}} of Gram-positive or-ganisms can be demonstrated by both in vitro and in vivo tests. As a therapeutic agent, it has been restricted to topical use because of its inherent toxicity on parenteral administration. <b>Tyrothricin</b> is composed of two fractions, gram-icidin and tyrocidine. Except in relatively large amounts tyrocidine has little or no activity against most of the Gram-positive bacteria. On the other hand, gramicidin in very minute amounts exerts a marked antibacterial activity against many of these organisms, and is therefore largely respon-sible for the major activity of <b>tyrothricin.</b> As <b>tyrothricin</b> is used in the form of ointments, emulsions, troches, etc. for topical therapy, and as there is some controversy in the literature concern-ing the effect of serum on the bacteriostatic effi-cacy of this antibiotic, it seemed desirable to in-vestigate the extent of its reduced activity, if any, in the presence of serum. Dubos (1) stated that the effect of gramicidin is inhibited "only to a small extent by serum, tissue exudates or peptones. " Rammelkamp (2), however, noted that serum, exudates and feces markedly inhibit the activity of <b>tyrothricin,</b> and that approximately 100 times the amount of this antibiotic was required to ex-ert an anti-streptococcal activity in their presence. Hotchkiss (3) reported that gramicidin is mildly inhibited by the presence of serum, but that tyro-cidine possesses little activity in its presence. Henderson (4) noted that gramicidin, in contrast to tyrocidine, is not affected by soluble proteins, such as serum albumin, "in any concentration," in fact "its activity seems enhanced by serum al-bumin, " a statement he attributes to Dubos...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Synthetic media {{containing}} ammonium succinate as {{the sole}} source of nitrogen permit Bacillus brevis to grow and form <b>tyrothricin</b> in aerated sub-merged culture. The yield of the antibiotic is almost doubled by adding a complex of B-vitamins to the medium, the effect being due specifically {{to the presence of}} biotin. Urea can be used as an alternative but less satisfactory source of nitrogen, but ammonium succinate cannot be replaced by ammonium salts of a number of other organic acids. The process can be operated successfully on a large scale. Normally, B. brevis will grow, but will not produce <b>tyrothricin,</b> in submerged culture in the presence of complex nitrogen sources. An exception to this has been observed, but metabolic investigations show distinct differences in the behaviour of the organism (in submerged culture) in synthetic and in peptone media. An outline of previous work on the submerged-culture formation of <b>tyrothricin</b> has been given in the preceding paper (Appleby, Knowles, Pearson & White, 1947). It was then decided to aim at developing a synthetic medium containing ingredients which would provide BaciElus brevis with nitrogen sources capable of supporting the production of <b>tyrothricin</b> in submerged culture, and which would be available in such quantity and at such cost as would permit of the use of the method on a large scale. This aim was realized...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{extracts}} from Bacillus brevis (A. T. C.

When this material was separated by paper and silica-gel thin-layer chromatography and paper electrophoresis 14 C {{was located in}} those regions that also contained gramicidin and tyrocidine. From {{a study of the}} properties of the system responsible for the incorporation it was deduced that non-tyrothricin materials were present. It was shown that the methods normally used to characterize <b>tyrothricin</b> do not adequately distinguish between <b>tyrothricin</b> and non-tyrothricin materials. However, a method for separating these materials was devised. This involved elution with ethanol from columns of acid alumina followed by gel filtration on Sephadex LH- 20 with dimethylformamide–water solvent. The behaviour of gramicidin and tyrocidine on the Sephadex LH- 20 column was examined, and it was concluded that the separation was not caused simply by gel filtration of unassociated molecules.

40|$|The {{particulate}} NADH oxidase {{activity of}} Bacillus brevis is inhibited by tyro-cidine and the kinetics of inhibition {{indicate that the}} NADH dehydrogenase region is the primary site of action. A decrease in NADH oxidase activity of electron transport particles and of NADH oxidase activity of whole organisms occurs in batch culture in the later stages of growth when production of <b>tyrothricin</b> increases.

40|$|Introduction. Acne vulgaris {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} skin disorders in adolescents but also affects a substantial number of adults, mainly females. In comparison to established topical acne therapies, <b>tyrothricin</b> 0. 1 % was investigated as an alternative topical therapeutic option. Further, the reliability and validity of the parameter fluorescence quantity as well as the fluorescences of coproporphyrin III and protoporphyrin IX for quantifying acne severity and identifying acne lesions were investigated. Finally, the validity of the Dermatology Life Quality Index in adult females with acne tarda was examined. Methods. An exploratory, randomized clinical study and a cohort study were performed. Clinical acne symptoms were evaluated systematically. Optical parameters for identifying acne severity (quantification and identification of follicular fluorescences) were used. Reliability was measured using intraclass correlation. Sensitivity or respectively responsiveness were measured using effect sizes. Construct validity was analyzed by means of bivariate and multivariate correlations. Results. Acne lesions reduced under <b>tyrothricin</b> (- 14. 2; 95 % Confidence Interval: - 21. 1 to - 7. 3). Compared to the results of the combination of clindamycin + benzoyl peroxide (- 28. 4; 95 % Confidence Interval: - 39. 9 to - 6. 9) and benzoyl peroxide 5 % (- 26. 9; 95 % Confidence Interval: - 39. 6 to - 14. 2), the combination product had the best efficacy. <b>Tyrothricin</b> had the least side effects. An association between the number of lesions and fluorescence quantity could be shown in the investigated skin areas. Strongest associations were seen between fluorescence quantity and inflammatory lesions. In 14 out of 48 cases, r was ≥ 0. 3. The sensitivity of the parameter fluorescence quantity was moderate (Effect Size: 0. 14 to 0. 77). Coproporphyrin III could be related to non-inflammatory lesions (r = 0. 69 to 0. 83). With a mean effect size of 0. 64 in quality of life measurement in adult female acne tarda patients, it was demonstrated that the Dermatology Life Quality Index could display the influence of acne severity on the quality of life. Discussion. <b>Tyrothricin</b> did not show comparable effects to the established comparator products. Nevertheless, based on its good tolerability, lesion reduction and the absence of resistances, it is a potential therapy option. The parameter fluorescence quantity could be used in facial regions with high acne manifestation. It could be shown that coproporphyrin III has a strong correlation with non-inflammatory lesions. This forms the basis of a differentiated and early detection of acne activity through optical methods. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the Dermatology Life Quality Index is a valid parameter for investigating the quality of life in female acne tarda patients...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTyrothricin, {{a complex}} mixture of {{antibiotic}} peptides from Bacillus brevis, {{was reported in}} 1944 to have antimalarial activity rivalling that of quinine in chickens infected with Plasmodium gallinaceum. We have isolated the major components of <b>tyrothricin,</b> cyclic decapeptides collectively known as the tyrocidines, and tested them against the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum using standard in vitro assays. Although the tyrocidines differ from each other by conservative amino acid substitutions in only three positions, their observed 50 % parasite inhibitory concentrations (IC 50) spanned three orders of magnitude (0. 58 to 360  nM). Activity correlated strictly with increased apparent hydrophobicity and reduced total side-chain surface area {{and the presence of}} ornithine and phenylalanine in key positions. In contrast, mammalian cell toxicity and haemolytic activities of the respective peptides were considerably less variable (2. 6 to 28  μM). Gramicidin S, a structurally analogous antimicrobial peptide, was less active (IC 50 = 1. 3  μM) and selective than the tyrocidines. It exerted its parasite inhibition by rapid and selective lysis of infected erythrocytes as judged by fluorescence and light microscopy. The tyrocidines, however, did not cause an overt lysis of infected erythrocytes, but an inhibition of parasite development and life-cycle progression...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} fifteen years three discoveries were made which have had a marked {{influence}} on the course of bacterial chemotherapy and related fields. The first discovery made by Fleming (1) in 1929 was the forerunner of the work on penicillin by Chain, Florey et al (2); the second made by Domagk (3) in 1935 Jed to the synthesis of numerous sulfonamides; and the third, made by Dubos in 1939 (4), stimulated intensive search for chemotherapeutic agents among the microbial population of the water and soil. All approaches proved highly suc-cessful, as evidenced by the appearance of a number of useful chemotherapeutic agents, such as sulfanilamide, sulfadiazine, <b>tyrothricin</b> and penicillin. The majority of the preparations introduced to date appear to be mainly effective in infections produced by gram-positive bacteria, although a few gram-negative species, such as the gonococcus arid meningococcus are extremely sen-sitive to the sulfonamides (5, 6), as well as to certain antibiotic agents (7, 8). Reports also suggest that while a few sulfonamides (9, 10) appear to be useful in the treatment of bacillary dysentery, the occurrence of toxic effects, such a...|$|E
40|$|To {{find out}} the {{incidence}} of contact hypersensitivity due to various antibacterial agents, patch tests were performed with these medications in 101 patients suspected to havek developed contact dermatitis due to some such agent. Positive patch tests were obtained with nitrofurazone, (furacin) in 56 cases, neomycin in 28 cases penicillin in 12 cases, <b>tyrothricin</b> (tyroderm), gentamicin (genticyn), framycitin (soframycin) and oxytetracycline (terramycin) in 13 cases each, triple sulfa, and mercurochrome in 9 cases each and acriflavine in 4 cases. Two cases showed patch tests with brilliant green, but none with gentian violet. Twenty eight patients were negative with all drugs tested. Many patients showed positive patch tests {{with more than one}} antibacterial agent. Neomycin 20 % in petrolatum gave more frequent positive patch tests compared to the commericial 0. 35 % neomycin ointment or 20 % aqueous neomycin, but {{there was no significant difference}} between the commercial 0. 2 % nitrofurazone ointment, 2 % nitrofurazone in petrolatum of 22 controls, 6 patients showed positive patch tests with the commercial neomycin ointment as well as 20 % neomycin in petrolatum, 1 patient with 0. 2 % nitrofurazone ointment and 5 patients with 200 % nitrofurzone in petrolatum...|$|E
