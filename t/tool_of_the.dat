5|$|By the Roman Period of Egypt, the {{traditional}} Egyptian reed pen {{had been replaced}} by the chief writing <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greco-Roman world: a shorter, thicker reed pen with a cut nib. Likewise, the original Egyptian pigments were discarded in favor of Greek lead-based inks. The adoption of Greco-Roman writing tools influenced Egyptian handwriting, as hieratic signs became more spaced, had rounder flourishes, and greater angular precision.|$|E
5|$|Essad Pasha Toptani, as {{minister}} {{of war and}} interior, was against a peaceful solution of the problem. He opposed the International Commission of Control which believed that the problem could be solved by diplomatic means. The Prince and his cabinet accepted Essad Pasha's proposals for a military solution. Several thousand Italian rifles and Austrian machine and mountain guns were purchased and distributed to the (predominantly Muslim) population of central Albania. They believed that the new regime was a <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> (Christian) Great Powers and the landowners that owned half of the arable land. On the basis of those beliefs they revolted.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Kartodikromo {{published}} Rasa Merdika (A Sense of Independence), which {{dealt with}} {{a young man who}} goes against his priyayi father, a <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch colonial government, and tries to find personal independence. Another novel, Cermin Buah Keroyalan (Mirror of the Fruit of Royalty), and stage play, Kromo Bergerak (Kromo is Moving), were published not long after.|$|E

5|$|Born on 9 January 1910 in Damascus to {{a middle}} class Greek Orthodox Christian family, his father, Joseph, working as a grain merchant. Aflaq was first educated in the westernized schools of the French Mandate of Syria. In 1929, he left Syria to study {{philosophy}} abroad at the Sorbonne in Paris. During his stay Aflaq {{was influenced by the}} works of Henri Bergson, and met his longtime collaborator Salah al-Din al-Bitar, a fellow Syrian nationalist. Aflaq founded an Arab Student Union at the Sorbonne, and discovered the writings of Karl Marx. He returned to Syria in 1932, and became active in communist politics, but left the movement when the government of Léon Blum, supported by the French Communist Party (FCP), continued France's old politics towards its colonies. Aflaq, and others, had believed that the FCP followed pro-independence policies towards the French colonies. It had not helped that the Syrian–Lebanese Communist Party (SLCP) supported the FCP's decision. From then on Aflaq saw the communist movement as a <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union. He was impressed by the organisation and ideology of Antun Saadeh's Syrian Social Nationalist Party.|$|E
5|$|Fighting soon erupted between {{elements}} of the Pathet Lao and the Royal Lao Army. Although tentative negotiations resumed between the factions, matters took {{a turn for the}} worse when neutralist Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma was arrested during a right-wing coup attempt. U.S. Ambassador Leonard Unger then notified the generals that the U.S. government would continue to support Souvanna. This turn of events had a profound effect on Laotian politics: First, it affirmed American support for Souvannah, only a few years after the U.S. had denounced him as a <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leftists; It also caused the neutralists to shift political allies from the left to the right; Finally, in May 1964, Souvannah announced the political union of the rightists and neutralists against the left.|$|E
5|$|When Strabo was {{assigned}} to the governorship of Egypt in AD 15, Sejanus became the sole commander of the Praetorians and instigated reforms that helped shape the guard into a powerful <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> principate. In AD 20 the scattered encampments inside the city were centralized into a single garrison just outside Rome and the number of cohorts was increased from nine to twelve, one of which now held the daily guard at the palace. The practice of joint leadership between two prefects was abandoned, and Sejanus himself appointed the centurions and tribunes. With these changes in effect, Sejanus now commanded the complete loyalty of a force of around 12,000 soldiers, all of which were at his immediate disposal. The facade of Augustus was no longer maintained, and Tiberius openly displayed the strength of the guard at parades.|$|E

25|$|Reacting {{to highly}} exaggerated {{fears that the}} Armenians were a <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russians, the Young Turks {{forcibly}} evacuated the Armenians from eastern Anatolia, regardless of the 600,000 or more lives lost in the Armenian Genocide. The Young Turks lost control as the war ended and fled into exile.|$|E
25|$|Diệm {{has been}} a {{controversial}} historical figure in historiography on Vietnam War scholarship. Some historians portrayed him as a <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. policymakers, some considered him an avatar of Vietnamese tradition. Nevertheless, some recent studies have portrayed Diệm from a more Vietnamese-centred perspective as a competent leader with his own vision on nation building and modernisation of South Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|After Pitt's {{resignation}} in February 1801, Fox had undertaken {{a partial}} return to politics. Having opposed the Addington ministry (though he approved of its negotiation of the Peace of Amiens) as a Pitt-style <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King, Fox gravitated towards the Grenvillite faction, which shared {{his support for}} Catholic emancipation and composed the only parliamentary alternative to a coalition with the Pittites.|$|E

25|$|The pro-Ottoman peasants {{believed}} that the new regime of the Principality of Albania was a <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six Christian Great Powers and the landowners that owned half of the arable land. Revolt was led by Muslim leaders Haxhi Qamili, Arif Hiqmeti, Musa Qazimi and Mustafa Ndroqi. This group of discontented Muslim clerics gathered around Essad Pasha Toptani who proclaimed himself the savior of Albania and Islam.|$|E
25|$|Miller (2006) {{explains}} {{that a significant}} amount of the house churches or unregistered congregations and meeting points of the Protestant spectrum, that refuse to join the Three-Self Church—China Christian Council, belong to the Chinese Independent Churches. Congregations of the Little Flock or the True Jesus Church tend to be uncooperative towards the Three-Self Church as to their principle it represents not only a <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government but also a different Christian tradition.|$|E
25|$|Administrative Collegia (ministries) were {{established}} in St. Petersburg, to replace the old governmental departments. In 1722 Peter promulgated his famous Table of ranks. As {{part of the government}} reform, the Orthodox Church was partially incorporated into the country's administrative structure, in effect making it a <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state. Peter abolished the patriarchate and replaced it with a collective body, the Holy Synod, led by a lay government official. Peter continued and intensified his predecessors' requirement of state service for all nobles.|$|E

25|$|After {{coming to}} power, Deng Xiaoping may have overemphasized Zhou Enlai's {{achievements}} to distance the Communist Party from Mao's Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution, {{both of which}} had seriously weakened the Party's prestige. Deng observed that Mao's disastrous policies could no longer represent the Party's finest hour, but that the legacy and character of Zhou Enlai could. Furthermore, Deng received credit for enacting successful economic policies that Zhou initially proposed. By actively associating itself with an already popular Zhou Enlai, Zhou's legacy {{may have been used}} (and possibly distorted) as a political <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Party after his death.|$|E
25|$|During {{the sixteenth}} century the Attorney General was used to pass {{messages}} between the House of Lords and House of Commons, although he was viewed suspiciously by the Commons and seen as a <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lords and the King. In 1673 the Attorney General began {{to take up a}} seat in the House of Commons, and since then it has been convention to ensure that all Attorneys General are members of the House of Commons or House of Lords, although there is no requirement that they be so. During the constitutional struggle centred on the Royal Declaration of Indulgence in 1672 and 1673 the Attorney General officially became the Crown's representative in legal matters.|$|E
25|$|Tan Malaka argued {{strongly}} that communism and Islam were compatible, and that, in Indonesia, revolution should be built upon both. Thus, {{he was a}} strong supporter of the PKI's continued alliance with Sarekat Islam (SI), and was troubled when, while he was in exile, the PKI broke away from SI. On an international scale, Tan Malaka also saw Islam as holding the potential for unifying the working classes in vast parts of North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia against imperialism and capitalism. This position put him in opposition to many European Communists and the leadership of Comintern, who saw religious belief as a hindrance to a proletarian revolution and a <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ruling class.|$|E

25|$|In 1927, Deming was {{introduced}} to Walter A. Shewhart of the Bell Telephone Laboratories by C.H. Kunsman of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Deming found great inspiration {{in the work of}} Shewhart, the originator of the concepts of statistical control of processes and the related technical <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control chart, as Deming began to move toward the application of statistical methods to industrial production and management. Shewhart's idea of common and special causes of variation led directly to Deming's theory of management. Deming saw that these ideas could be applied not only to manufacturing processes, but also to the processes by which enterprises are led and managed. This key insight made possible his enormous influence on the economics of the industrialized world after 1950.|$|E
25|$|Jon Birgerson was succeeded as {{archbishop}} by Eystein (Beatus Augustinus, 1158–88), previously royal {{secretary and}} treasurer, {{a man of}} brilliant intellect, strong will and deep piety. Such a man was then needed to defend the liberty of the Catholic Church against the encroachments of King Sverre, who wished to make the Church a mere <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temporal power. The archbishop was compelled to flee from Norway to England until {{he was able to}} return, and a sort of reconciliation took place later between him and the king. But on Eystein's death Sverre renewed his attacks, and Archbishop Eric had to leave the country and take refuge with Archbishop Absalon of Lund. At last, when Sverre attacked the papal legate, Pope Innocent III laid the king and his partisans under interdict.|$|E
25|$|The P.A.B.C. {{initiative}} (Public Art Building Communities), {{has allowed}} me to make a bridge between the community, the Restaurant Mama Ayesha’s, the arts and all the people who have made this mural a reality.

I hope that this mural will become a teaching <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> History of the Presidents for schools, children and the public in general. This is a gift to the City of Washington DC to celebrate this historical moment in American History and will remain open to the public to see for generations to come. This is fulfilling the idea that mural art is available for the public and for the masses.|$|E
