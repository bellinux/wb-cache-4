5|$|Brown {{opened his}} {{campaign}} with {{a speech at}} Bowling Green on August26, 1899. He answered many allegations {{that had been made}} about him, including claims <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> secretly been seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination all along, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ambitions of succeeding Senator William Joseph Deboe, and that following the nominating convention, he had agreed to speak on behalf of the Goebel ticket.

Outgoing Senator Blackburn also charged that Brown was bolting the party again, just as he had in supporting Stephen Douglas over John C. Breckinridge for president in 1860. Brown replied by quoting an article by William Jennings Bryan's Omaha World-Herald that asserted the right of an individual to vote against the nominee of his party if the individual deemed the nominee unfit.|$|E
