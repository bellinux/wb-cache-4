30|$|The authors {{conducted}} microtremor {{observations in}} the damaged area and evaluated <b>the</b> <b>predominant</b> period of <b>the</b> ground surface (Noguchi and Kagawa 2014) based on horizontal to vertical (H/V) spectral ratios.

40|$|In case of {{irregular}} dispersive media, {{a proper}} analysis of higher modes existing in a dispersion plot becomes essential for predicting the {{shear wave velocity}} profile of ground {{on the basis of}} surface wave tests. In such cases, an establishment of <b>the</b> <b>predominant</b> mode becomes quite important. In the current investigation for Rayleigh wave propagation, <b>the</b> <b>predominant</b> modes have been evaluated by maximizing the normalized vertical displacements along the free surface. Eigenvectors computed from the dynamic stiffness matrix (DSM) approach are analyzed to find <b>the</b> <b>predominant</b> mode. <b>The</b> results obtained are then compared with those reported in the literature. By varying the displacement amplitude ratios of <b>the</b> <b>predominant</b> mode to <b>the</b> other modes, dispersion plots have also been generated from the multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) method. The establishment of <b>the</b> <b>predominant</b> mode becomes especially significant, where usually only two to six sensors are employed and <b>the</b> governing (<b>predominant)</b> modal dispersion curve is usually observed rather than several multiple modes, which can be otherwise identified by using around 24 to 48 sensors...|$|R
