5|$|The {{formation}} of the Rüstungsstab allowed Speer, for the first time, to consolidate key arms manufacturing projects for the three branches of the Wehrmacht {{under the authority of}} his ministry, further marginalising the Reich Ministry of Aviation. Several departments, including the once powerful <b>Technical</b> <b>Office,</b> were disbanded or transferred to the new task force.

Of course, here the architect is privileged; behind his forms, however, one cannot fail {{to grasp the}} human, spiritual and social aspirations of a people. This is partially true of all architects, because their work is always involved in a collective context; but for none, or perhaps only for very few others, is it evident in the same degree. In fact, Sharon {{could have been a}} driving force in the old-new land's adventure, even without being a leader and an architect; or could have been simply a key-figure in the profession, as he was after the 1948 War of Independence in Ben Gurion's <b>technical</b> <b>office,</b> and later as president of the Association of Engineers and Architects; or, again, he could have been strictly an artist in his own right. The inner meaning of his architecture derives from these pendular alternatives, from the joyful refusal to select one of them, reducing the range of his vital tentacles." ...|$|E

Gerhard Berger won the last 2 races of the [...] season, followed by a lucky victory for Berger at the Italian Grand Prix in September 1988 in a season of total domination by McLaren, whose Honda powered MP4/4 had been designed by former colleague Steve Nichols, with some help from Barnard's replacement in the team, long time Brabham designer Gordon Murray.
