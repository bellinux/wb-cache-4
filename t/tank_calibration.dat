40|$|A {{fundamental}} component of any accountability system for nuclear materials is a <b>tank</b> <b>calibration</b> equation that relates {{the height of}} liquid in a tank to its volume. Tank volume calibration equations are typically determined from pairs of height and volume measurements taken {{in a series of}} calibration runs. After raw calibration data are standardized to a fixed set of reference conditions, the calibration equation is typically fit by dividing the data into several segments [...] corresponding to regions in the tank [...] and independently fitting the data for each segment. The estimates obtained for individual segments must then be combined to obtain an estimate of the entire calibration function. This process is tedious and time-consuming. Moreover, uncertainty estimates may be misleading because it is difficult to properly model run-to-tun variability and between-segment correlation. In this paper, they describe a model whose parameters can be estimated simultaneously for all segments of the calibration data, thereby eliminating the need for segment-by-segment estimation. The essence of the proposed model is to define a suitable polynomial to fit to each segment and then extend its definition to the domain of the entire calibration function, so that it (the entire calibration function) can be expressed as the sum of these extended polynomials. The model provides defensible estimates of between-run variability and yields a proper treatment of between-segments correlations. A portable software package, called TANCS, has been developed to facilitate the acquisition, standardization, and analysis of <b>tank</b> <b>calibration</b> data. The TANCS package was used for the calculations in an example presented to illustrate the unified modeling approach described in this paper. With TANCS, a trial calibration function can be estimated and evaluated in a matter of minutes...|$|E
40|$|There {{is limited}} {{experimental}} data describing the mixing processes and coherent velocity structures {{near the surface}} of the ocean. These play an important part in the interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean and thus affect the climate of the earth. A robust, low cost thermistor based sensor suitable for use in the detection and quantification of velocity structures has been designed and developed. The flow sensor, a thermal anemometer, consists of a self-heated thermistor that is maintained at constant temperature using a feedback control circuit. The thermistor is exposed to the moving fluid and the heat transfer from it {{is a function of the}} velocity of the fluid. The sensor has been interfaced with a PC to facilitate data acquisition. A tow <b>tank</b> <b>calibration</b> and testing facility also interfaced to a PC was developed. The sensor is compensated for changes in ambient fluid temperature, which is a major problem for all thermal anemometers that operate in water. The calibration relation that is normally used for thermistor anemometers has been improved upon and gives better results than any found in the literature. In order to provide electrical isolation from the water the sensor was protected with an insulating coating. The effect of coating thickness and the type of coating used on sensor performance was investigated. It was found that a polymer coating resulted in a sensor that did not show any appreciable drift due to sensor contamination over a number of months. This is a significant improvement over glass coated hot film sensors, which are widely used for velocity measurements in water and previously developed thermistor based sensors. The effect of various control circuit parameters on the frequency response of the sensor was determined and these parameters were tuned to give maximum frequency response A procedure for easily replacing broken/damaged sensors in the field was also developed...|$|E

40|$|Direct link: [URL] audienceIn PA 12 tube extrusion, {{calibration}} or sizing {{is the key}} step of {{the process}} that affects subsequent mechanical properties. The extruded tube is pulled through a cylindrical calibrator under vacuum. A water flow rate is applied at the inner side of the calibrator, creating a lubricant water layer at the polymer outer surface. The {{scope of this article}} is to show how this lubrication influences the elongation at break of tubes through drawing kinematics of the polymer. Lubricant water layer thickness measurements and on-line video recording have been employed to monitor the lubrication dependence of the velocity profiles from the extruder die to the end of calibrator. Velocities were measured through three independent innovative methods and thirty-two calibration conditions have been carried out to validate our work. Three main calibration parameters were found to determine the water layer thickness: the level of vacuum applied in the <b>calibration</b> <b>tank,</b> the water flow rate at the calibrator entrance, and the line speed. The influence of each parameter on lubrication level was found out. Simultaneously, the draw ratio in the <b>calibration</b> <b>tank</b> was deduced from velocity profiles. This parameter was found to affect tensile properties and to depend strongly on the level of lubrication during calibration. We showed quantitatively that using the water layer thickness leads to a diminution of the draw ratio in the <b>calibration</b> <b>tank</b> and an increase of the elongation at break. This implies that we are now able to optimize tensile properties by fitting the main calibration parameters to improve lubrication and restrict draw ratio in the <b>calibration</b> <b>tank...</b>|$|R

40|$|Sampling the {{collected}} suspension in a storage tank {{is a common}} procedure to obtain soil loss data. A calibration curve of the tank has {{to be used to}} obtain actual concentration values from those measured by sampling. However, literature suggests that using a <b>tank</b> <b>calibration</b> curve was not a common procedure in the past. For the clay soil of the Sparacia (Italy) experimental station, this investigation aimed to establish a link between the relative performances of the USLE-M and USLE-MM models, usable to predict plot soil loss at the event temporal scale, and soil loss measurement errors. Using all available soil loss data, lower soil loss prediction errors were obtained with the USLE-MM (exponent of the erosivity term, b 1 > 1) than the USLE-M (b 1 = 1). A systematic error of the soil loss data is unexpected for the Sparacia soil because the calibration curve does not depend on the water level in the tank. In any case, this type of error does not have any effect on the b 1 exponent. Instead, this exponent decreases as the level of underestimation increases for increasing soil loss values. This type of error can occur at Sparacia if it is assumed that a soil loss measurement can be obtained by a bottle sampler dipped close {{to the bottom of the}} tank after mixing the suspension and assuming that the measured concentration coincides with the actual one. In this case, the risk is to obtain a lower b 1 value than the actual one. In conclusion, additional investigations on the factors determining errors in soil loss data collected by a sampling procedure are advisable because these errors can have a noticeable effect on the calibrated empirical models for soil loss prediction...|$|E
40|$|Whilst {{growing demand}} for energy in Nepal and neighbouring- countries, {{investments}} in hydro- power projects appears continuously, both by local and multinational companies. As a consequence of this, Turbine Testing Lab was founded in 2011 at Kathmandu University in Nepal. The laboratory is rapidly developing, and is currently implementing a Francis turbine test rig. A long- term goal for the laboratory, is to execute model tests according to IEC 60193, which is the standard used in model tests of hydraulic runners. When determining the hydraulic efficiency of a runner, a central parameter is the discharge measurement. According to IEC, any secondary device {{used to measure the}} discharge shall be calibrated in sit&# 249; against one of the following primary methods: the weighing method, volumetric method or the moving- screen method. The aim of this work has been to develop and design a primary method for calibration of the flowmeter at TTL. Based on an evaluation of the mentioned primary methods, as well as economy, accuracy and correspondence with technical staff, a volumetric method is chosen as calibration principle. The principle of the method is based on collecting water into a tank with a known geometry, and by execution of level- and time measurements calculating the discharge. The calibration rig consists of a flowmeter, inlet nozzle, deflector mechanism, emergency weir, calibration tank, level measurement, time measurement, drainage system, emergency weir, and an upgraded pipe run at the measuring section of the flowmeter. It is developed a LabView program, for logging and processing the voltage output from the flowmeter. The other measurements executed is registered manually in a separate calibration sheet for data processing. An evaluation of the accuracy in the calibration method is conducted, which may be used to determine the total uncertainty when the calibration facility is installed. Provided design and installation according to ISO 8316, the accuracy in discharge measurement with the volumetric method lies within ± 0, 1 - 0, 2 %. The major uncertainty contribution in the method lies in the determination of the volume collected, and the corresponding <b>tank</b> <b>calibration.</b> It is proposed to reduce the diameter of the flowmeter from original size of 400 mm to 250 mm. Reduction in diameter and upgraded pipe run will increase accuracy of the flow measurement, a result of improved flow pattern at the measuring section. When the primary calibration rig is installed at TTL, this will be a large step towards an IEC- approved laboratory in Nepal, which open doors against an international market. </p...|$|E

The selected study area is Bedup Basin, Sarawak, Malaysia, a rural catchment in humid region. A new global optimization method named as particle swarm optimization (PSO) was proposed, and compared with shuffle complex evolution and genetic algorithm techniques for calibrating the tank models’ parameters automatically. PSO is also hybrid with neural network to form particle swarm optimization feedforward neural network (PSONN) to overcome the slow convergence rate and trapping at local minima problems. PSONN performance is then compared with multilayer perceptron and recurrent networks, that used backpropagation algorithm. Models performances are measured using coefficient of correlation (R) and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (E 2). Generally, artificial neural networks performance is slightly better than tank model.

The calibration of the continuous isotopic methane analyzers {{used in this}} study required both a linear calibration and a mole fraction correction, and a correction for cross-interference from ethane. In this paper, we describe laboratory and field calibration of the analyzers for tower-based applications, and characterize their performance in the field for the period January–December 2016. Prior to deployment, each analyzer was calibrated using high methane mole fraction air bottles with various isotopic ratios, from biogenic to thermogenic source values, diluted in zero air. Furthermore, at each tower location, three field <b>calibration</b> <b>tanks</b> were employed, from ambient to high mole fractions, with various isotopic ratios. By testing multiple calibration schemes, we determined an optimized field calibration method. A method to correct for cross interference from ethane is also described. Using an independent field tank for evaluation, the standard deviation of 4 -hour means of the isotopic ratio of methane difference from the known value was found to be 0. 26  ‰ δ 13 CH 4. Following improvements in the field <b>calibration</b> <b>tank</b> sampling scheme, the standard deviation of 4 -hour means was 0. 11  ‰, well within the target compatibility of 0. 2  ‰. Round robin style testing using tanks with near ambient isotopic ratios indicated mean errors of − 0. 14 to 0. 03  ‰ for each of the analyzers. Flask to in-situ comparisons showed mean differences over the year of 0. 02 and 0. 08  ‰, for the East and South towers, respectively. Regional sources in this region were difficult to differentiate from strong perturbations in the background. During the afternoon hours, the median enhancements of isotopic ratio measured at three of the towers, compared to the background tower, were − 0. 15 to 0. 12  ‰ with standard deviations of the 10 -min isotopic ratio enhancements of 0. 8  ‰. In terms of source attribution, analyzer compatibility of 0. 2  ‰ δ 13 CH 4 affords the ability to distinguish a 50  ppb CH 4 peak from a biogenic source from one originating from a thermogenic source.

The salt loop contained two receiver panels, components such as flanges and a check valve, vortex shedding and ultrasonic flow meters, and an impedance pressure transducer. Tests were conducted on procedures for filling and thawing a panel, and assessing components and instrumentation in a molten salt environment. Four categories of experiments were conducted: (1) cold filling procedures, (2) freeze/thaw procedures, (3) component tests, and (4) instrumentation tests. Cold-panel and -piping fill experiments are described, in which the panels and piping were preheated to temperatures below the salt freezing point prior to initiating flow, to determine the feasibility of cold filling the receiver and piping. The transient thermal response was measured, and heat transfer coefficients and transient stresses were calculated from the data. Freeze/thaw experiments were conducted with the panels, in which the salt was intentionally allowed to freeze in the receiver tubes, then thawed with heliostat beams. Slow thermal cycling tests were conducted to measure both how well various designs of flanges (e. g., tapered flanges or clamp type flanges) hold a seal under thermal conditions typical of nightly shut down, and the practicality of using these flanges on high maintenance components. In addition, the flanges were thermally shocked to simulate cold starting the system. Instrumentation such as vortex shedding and ultrasonic flow meters were tested alongside each other, and compared with flow measurements from <b>calibration</b> <b>tanks</b> in the flow loop...|$|R
40|$|Direct link: [URL] audienceIn {{polyamide}} 12 (PA 12) tube extrusion, calibration {{is crucial}} for the major final properties such as elongation at break or burst pressure. In external calibration, the extruded tube is pulled through a cylindrical calibrator located in a water tank under vacuum. A water flow rate is applied at the calibrator inner side, creating a lubricating water layer at the polymer outer surface. A combination of a quenching and a mechanical drawing was highlighted during calibration by on-line measurements. A subsequent high molecular orientation in the outer tube layers was also featured by X-Ray diffraction and birefringence evaluation in light microscopy. Besides, influence of lubrication level in the sizing-sleeve was investigated by {{an estimate of the}} lubricating water layer and a characterization of the tube final surface state in different calibration conditions. Firstly, we quantitatively showed that rising the water layer thickness leads to a diminution of the draw ratio in the <b>calibration</b> <b>tank,</b> DrCAL (ratio between line velocity and velocity at the calibrator entrance). Excellent correlation has been found between tube superficial orientation and DrCAL: a reduced elongation of the polymer in the calibrator leads to a lower level of superficial orientation. Secondly, two kinds of surface defects were detected on the tubes by light microscopy and microtopography. At last, several correlations were featured with mechanical properties. Elongation at break was found to strongly depend on the molecular orientation resulting from calibration. Moreover, origin of rupture was investigated during tensile testing in light microscopy. We emphasized that surface defects alignments perpendicular to the extrusion initiate the rupture by creating a significant crack via coalescence of initial defects. Thus, microstructure, surface state and tensile properties can be controlled by fitting the calibration parameters to improve lubrication and reduce the draw ratio in calibrator...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{chambers}} for {{measurement of}} soil CO 2 efflux were compared against known CO 2 fluxes ranging from 0. 32 to 10. 01 molCO 2 m− 2 s− 1 and {{generated by a}} specially developed <b>calibration</b> <b>tank.</b> Chambers were tested on fine and coarse homogeneous quartz sand with particle sizes of 0. 05 – 0. 2 and 0. 6 mm, respectively. The effect of soil moisture on chamber measurementswas tested by wetting the fine quartz sand to about 25 %volumetricwater content. Non-steady-state through-flow chambers either underestimated or overestimated fluxes from− 21 to+ 33 % {{depending on the type}} of chamber and the method of mixing air within the chamber’s headspace. However, when results of all systems tested were averaged, fluxes were within 4 % of references. Non-steady-state on-through-flow chambers underestimated or overestimated fluxes from – 35 to + 6 %. On average, the underestimation was about 13 – 14 % on fine sand and 4 % on coarse sand. When the length of the measurement period was increased, the underestimation increased due to the rising concentration within the chamber headspace, which reduced the diffusion gradient within the soil. Steady-state through-flow chambers worked almost equally well in all sand types used in this study. They overestimated the fluxes on average by 2 – 4 %. Overall, the reliability of the chambers was not related to the measurement principle per se. Even the same chambers, with different collar designs, showed highly variable results. The mixing of air within the chamber can be a major source of error. Excessive turbulence inside the chamber can cause mass flow of CO 2 from the soil into the chamber. The chamber headspace concentration also affects the flux by altering the concentration gradient between the soil and the chamber...|$|R
40|$|The MiniBooNE {{experiment}} [1] {{is motivated}} by the LSND observation, [2] which has been interpreted as {nu}{sub {mu}} {yields} {nu}{sub e} oscillations, and by the atmospheric neutrino deficit, [3, 4, 5] which may be ascribed to {nu}{sub {mu}} oscillations into another type of neutrino. MiniBooNE is a single-detector experiment designed to: obtain {approx} 1000 {nu}{sub {mu}} {yields} {nu}{sub e} events if the LSND signal is due to {nu}{sub {mu}} {yields} {nu}{sub e} oscillations, establishing the oscillation signal at the > 5 {sigma} level as shown in Fig. 1. 1; extend the search for {nu}{sub {mu}} {yields} {nu}{sub e} oscillations significantly beyond what has been studied previously if no signal is observed; search for {nu}{sub {mu}} disappearance to address the atmospheric neutrino deficit with a signal that is a suppression of the rate of {nu}{sub {mu}}C {yields} {mu}N events from the expected 600, 000 per year; measure the oscillation parameters as shown in Fig. 1. 2 if oscillations are observed; and test CP conservation in the lepton sector if oscillations are observed by running with separate {nu}{sub {mu}} and {bar {nu}}{sub {mu}} beams. The detector will consist of a spherical tank 6. 1 m (20 feet) in radius, as shown in Fig. 1. 3, that stands in a 45 -foot diameter cylindrical vault. An inner tank structure at 5. 75 m radius will support 1280 8 -inch phototubes (10 % coverage) pointed inward and optically isolated from the outer region of the tank. The tank will be filled with 807 t of mineral oil, resulting in a 445 t fiducial volume. The outer tank volume {{will serve as a}} veto shield for identifying particles both entering and leaving the detector with 240 phototubes mounted on the tank wall. Above the detector tank will be an electronics enclosure that houses the fast electronics and data acquisition system and a utilities enclosure that houses the plumbing, overflow <b>tank,</b> and <b>calibration</b> laser. The detector will be located {approx} 550 m from the Booster neutrino source. The neutrino beam, produced using 8 GeV protons from the Booster at FNAL, will consist of a target within a focusing system, followed by a {approx} 50 m long pion decay volume. The low energy, high intensity and 1 {micro}s time-structure of a neutrino beam produced from the Booster beam are ideal for this experiment. We assume that the Booster can reliably deliver protons for a typical run which is two-thirds of a calendar year. The sensitivities discussed above assume the experiment receives 5 x 10 {sup 20 } protons per year. This Booster experiment is compatible with the Fermilab collider and MI programs. The Booster must run at 7. 5 Hz to accommodate the MiniBooNE and collider programs simultaneously. The current schedule calls for data-taking to begin by the end of calendar year 2001...|$|R
40|$|Calibration {{can greatly}} {{increase}} {{the utility of}} collecting seafloor backscattering strength with multibeam echo sounders (MBES). A calibration procedure to determine high resolution, three dimensional transmit and receive beam patterns of a Reson SeaBat 7125 MBES was performed using the fresh water <b>calibration</b> <b>tank</b> at the University of New Hampshire. The measurements employed an omni-directional Reson TC 4034 projector/hydrophone as a reference transducer at an acoustic distance of 13 m. The multibeam sonar system was configured for 256 beams equi-angle mode and operating frequency of 396 kHz. The transmit beam pattern was computed for across-track angular range between +/– 90 o in 0. 1 o increments and along-track angular range between +/– 2. 55 o in 0. 09 o increments. Receive directional characteristics were measured for the across-track range of +/– 120 o in 0. 1 o increments with along-track angular range of +/– 1. 23 o in 0. 18 o increments. With these measurements, a three-dimensional plot of the transmit beam pattern was computed for {{the entire range of}} angles, although for the receive beam pattern it was only determined for the 0 o along-track angle. The reduced angular coverage of the receive beam pattern was due to discrepancies in the off-axis results that are thought to be related to receiver saturation. Measurements for the transmit beam pattern show a – 3 dB beamwidth of 0. 99 o for across-track angle of 0 o with side lobes below – 17 dB. The results show an unexplained curvature in the transmit beam pattern that would have gone un-noticed during a two dimensional beam pattern measurement. An interference effect causing ripples and attenuation of the transmit beam pattern was also observed. This effect is thought to be caused by a second 200 kHz projector mounted parallel to the 396 kHz projector. This interference occurs at an across-track angular region between + 30 o and + 75 o with gradual decrease in amplitude of about 3 dB. The receive beam pattern measurements show a – 3 dB beamwidth of approximately 0. 62 o for the most inner beams (beams 128 and 129) and of approximately 1. 40 o for the most outer beams (beams 1 and 256) at along-track angular position of 0 o with side-lobes below – 26 dB for the most inner beams and below – 17 dB for the most outer beams...|$|R
