60|$|When {{we reached}} the shore the Indian {{appeared}} from out the woods on the opposite side, but {{on account of the}} roar of the water it was difficult to communicate with him. He kept along the shore westward to his canoe, while we stopped at the angle where the stream turned southward around the precipice. I said to my companion <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> along the shore and keep the Indian in sight. We started to do so, being close together, the Indian behind us having launched his canoe again, but I saw the latter beckoning to me, and I called to my companion, who had just disappeared behind large rocks at the point of the precipice on his way down the stream, that I was going to help the Indian.|$|E

At the time, the editors commented that [...] "When we started we never dreamed we would still be around in the New Millenium. But, our philosophy was <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> doing {{it as long as}} it was fun and it still is. We hope you like the full colour cover." ...|$|E
60|$|Because {{of knowing}} <b>that</b> <b>that</b> which <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> private {{was a secret}} no longer, I grew disheartened, and instead of agreeing to Archie's {{proposition}} that {{the remainder of the}} day be spent in gaining yet more recruits, I turned my face homeward once more, agreeing crustily to meet those who had promised to become Minute Boys at the old ship-yard that evening.|$|R
500|$|This {{ambiguity}} over terminology {{has made}} historical {{analysis of the}} use of [...] "keeps" [...] problematic. While the term remains in common academic use, some academics prefer to use the term donjon, and most modern historians warn against using the term [...] "keep" [...] simplistically. The fortifications <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> today call <b>keeps</b> certainly did not necessarily form part of a unified medieval style, nor were they all used in a similar fashion during the period.|$|R
30|$|Patients were {{recruited}} through {{three types of}} clinician referrals: (1) the intake coordinator who registered patients {{in the waiting room}} could introduce the study before patients met with clinicians, (2) clinicians participating in the study could recruit their patients, and (3) clinicians not participating in the study could also recruit patients. For inclusion, patients had to receive mental health services at the hospital, provide written informed consent after an explanation of study procedures, and self-identify as a racial or ethnic minority. The exclusion criteria for patients were active suicidality, homicidality, intoxication, or a cognition-impairing condition such as dementia, mental retardation, or florid psychosis. As with clinician enrollment, our recruitment strategy may have introduced biases if participating clinicians enrolled patients whom they believed would support clinician and hospital policies on cultural competence, especially if the numbers of patients recruited by participating clinicians exceeded patients recruited by non-participating clinicians. To prevent potential repercussions from hospital administrators who could become upset that clinicians were not recruiting patients, we assured the hospital’s IRB <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> not <b>keep</b> track of which intake coordinators or clinicians recruited patients.|$|R
6000|$|... 6. If <b>we</b> <b>would</b> live in peace, let us {{remember}} our relations to God--as {{children to a}} father, and {{to each other as}} brethren. Will not the thoughts <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have one Father quiet us, and the thoughts <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are brethren unite us? It was this that made Abraham propose terms of peace to Lot (Gen 13): 'Let there be no strife,' saith he, 'between us, for we are brethren.' And we read of Moses, in Acts 7:26, using this argument to reconcile those that strove together, and to set them at one again: 'Sirs,' saith he, 'ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?' A deep sense of this relation, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are brethren, <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> us from dividing.|$|R
60|$|When I was {{a youngster}} {{and lived in}} the country, {{there were three of}} us boys who used to go very {{frequently}} to a small village about a mile from our homes. To reach this village it was necessary to cross a narrow river, and there was a toll-bridge for that purpose. The toll for every foot-passenger who went over this bridge was one cent. Now, this does not seem like a very high charge, but, at <b>that</b> time, <b>we</b> very often thought <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> much rather <b>keep</b> our pennies to spend in the village than to pay them to the old man who took toll on the bridge. But it was often necessary for us to cross the river, and to do so, and save our money at the same time, we used to adopt a very hazardous expedient.|$|R
40|$|Consider the {{following}} problem: given a metric space, some of whose points are "clients", open {{a set of}} at most $k$ facilities to minimize the average distance from the clients to these facilities. This is just the well-studied $k$-median problem, for which many approximation algorithms and hardness results are known. Note that the objective function encourages opening facilities in areas where there are many clients, and given a solution, it is often possible {{to get a good}} idea of where the clients are located. However, this poses {{the following}} quandary: what if the identity of the clients is sensitive information <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> like to <b>keep</b> private? Is it even possible to design good algorithms for this problem that preserve the privacy of the clients? In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of algorithms for discrete optimization problems in the framework of differential privacy (which formalizes the idea of protecting the privacy of individual input elements). <b>We</b> show <b>that</b> many such problems indeed have good approximation algorithms that preserve differential privacy; this is even in cases where it is impossible to preserve cryptographic definitions of privacy while computing any non-trivial approximation to even the_value_ of an optimal solution, let alone the entire solution. Apart from the $k$-median problem, we study the problems of vertex and set cover, min-cut, facility location, Steiner tree, and the recently introduced submodular maximization problem, "Combinatorial Public Projects" (CPP).

5000|$|At {{the time}} of his speaking, Fryer was on the faculty of Temple University in Philadelphia, but did not have the {{security}} of tenure, so was in real danger of losing his position if he had been identified [...] - [...] he had already lost a residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was later forced to leave a position on the staff of Friends Hospital because of his flamboyance; ironically the administrator who told him [...] "If you were gay and not flamboyant, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> you. If you were flamboyant and not gay <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> you.

60|$|When {{it became}} dark, <b>we</b> saw <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{could not leave}} that night. Even if a wagon did come, {{it would not be}} safe to drive over the fields in the darkness.

60|$|This last {{reason he}} made so plain to us <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{began to be}} {{sensible}} of it ourselves, so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> agreed to lay that thought aside, and proceed in our first course, westwards towards the sea; but, {{as if we had}} been loth to depart, we continued, by way of refreshing ourselves, to loiter two days upon this river, in which time our black prince, who delighted much in wandering up and down, came one evening and brought us several little bits of something, he knew not what, but he found it felt heavy and looked well, and showed it to me as what he thought was some rarity. I took not much notice of it to him, but stepping out and calling the gunner to me I showed it to him, and told him what I thought, viz., that it was certainly gold. He agreed with me in that, and also in what followed, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> take the black prince out with us the next day, and make him show us where he found it; that if there was any quantity to be found <b>we</b> <b>would</b> tell our company of it, but if there was but little <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> counsel, and have it to ourselves.|$|R
60|$|As for the place, neither they nor {{we could}} make any guess at {{what part of the}} country they should make the sea; but, as for us, we {{resolved}} to make the port St. Julian our first place to put in at, which is in the latitude of 50° 5' and that then, as wind and weather <b>would</b> permit, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> the coast as near as we could, till we came to Punta de St. Helena, where <b>we</b> <b>would</b> ride for some time, and, if possible, till we heard of them.|$|R
60|$|Being now, as I have said, a {{considerable}} number of us, and in condition to defend ourselves, the first thing we did was to give every one his hand <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> not separate from one another upon any occasion whatsoever, but <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> live and die together; <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> kill no food, but <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> distribute it in public; and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> be in all things guided by the majority, and not insist upon our own resolutions in anything if the majority were against it; <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> appoint a captain among us to be our governor or leader during pleasure; that while he was in office <b>we</b> <b>would</b> obey him without reserve, on pain of death; and that every one should take turn, but the captain was not to act in any particular thing without advice of the rest, and by the majority.|$|R

At the same time I was ready to make an offer of four rolls of Egyptian cloth. He rejected the offer with scorn, and after a long conversation let me know pretty plainly that he intended to take all our goods and animals, and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> might think ourselves fortunate in being allowed to pursue our way on foot.

Back up the canyon from the lip of the hole all marks were likewise removed. Then, at twilight, came John Carlson, who demanded Wickson's shoes.|$|R
