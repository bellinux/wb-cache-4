40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the level of terrestrial radioactivity on Phuket Island, which used to be the richest tin province in Thailand. We measured 124 survey points of terrestrial gamma dose rate at one meter above the surface of local soil along roads in the environs of Phuket Island. Another 31 survey points were examined inside an old ore-dressing plant. The terrestrial gamma dose rate of the Island (excluding the abandoned area of the old dressing plant) ranges from 20 to 900 nGy h- 1, while the geometric mean Island value was 190 nGy h- 1. Soil samples were also collected from selected areas having high gamma dose rates to analyze for activity concentrations of 226 Ra, 232 Th and 40 K. Based on these soil activities, the calculated terrestrial gamma dose rate found to range between 25 and 520 nGy h- 1. The corresponding annual effective doses varied between 0. 03 and 0. 6 mSv y- 1. The results of the terrestrial gamma dose rate obtained from direct measurement in the old <b>tin</b> dressing <b>plant</b> ranged from 110 - 17, 170 nGy h- 1 with a mean value of 1410 nGy h- 1.
