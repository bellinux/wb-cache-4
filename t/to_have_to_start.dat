He went 3-2 with a 3.30 ERA in 46 innings, which earned him the team's Rookie of the Year Award. Trombley played with many {{well-known}} players in 1993, including Kirby Puckett, Rick Aguilera and Dave Winfield. Early in his career, Trombley contributed to Indians designated hitter Eddie Murray's 3000th hit on June 30, 1995. He was sent to AAA for a short time, which drove him to start using a split finger fastball. In 1996, Trombley was recalled from AAA Salt Lake City to the Twins in 1996, and {{would be one of}} the most prominent relief pitchers in the league. He finished in the top six in appearances from 1998 through 2000. In 1999, when he was a free agent, Trombley posted 24 saves, which led to him signing a three-year deal with the Baltimore Orioles for $7.75 million.

[...] Eric Diep of XXL gave the album an XL, saying [...] "Matching his lyrical abilities with polished production and radio-ready hooks, The Gifted sees Wale inching towards hip-hop’s upper echelon, while still exhibiting the hunger of a young MC on the rise. “Born to lose, built to win,” he claims on “Heaven’s Afternoon.” Started from that bottom, but now he’s got it." [...] Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine gave the album three out of five stars, saying [...] "When he plays to his strengths on The Gifted, the results are impressive, but more mass-market tracks leave him sounding unoriginal and anonymous." [...] Miles Raymer of Pitchfork Media gave the album a 5.1 out of ten, saying [...] "What seems to be the main purpose of the record is to elevate Wale beyond the level of Rick Ross’ reliable second-stringer, a guy who’s capable of dropping the occasional strip club anthem in between a steady string of unremarkable features on pop songs. “Clappers” proves that when he embraces that job he’s actually really good at it.
