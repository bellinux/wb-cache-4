50|$|Because of its {{isolated}} and specialized habitat, E. camurum {{is of particular}} ecological concern. Anthropogenic effects {{are thought to be}} the cause of most population decline, as increased human development has been detrimental to both habitat and breeding. Additionally, E. camurum has been linked to spawning of the endangered <b>tan</b> <b>riffleshell</b> (Epioblasma florentina walkeri). Studies have shown the riffelshell larvae attach to E. camurum during maturation.|$|E
