5|$|The {{only major}} {{measurement}} {{that could not}} be made automatically or before the mission was the determination of the windspeed and direction. These change over time, and also due to changes in location, altitude, or wind shear. This demanded an accurate determination of <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general area of the target, and would normally be highly inaccurate if dialled in at the mission start. Taking this measurement while nearing the target was an important procedure on the CSBS; its manual included several methods of determining <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of the Mk. XIV, the manual described only one method of determining the wind, equivalent to the most complex of the procedures from the CSBS model.|$|E

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Scottsdale, Arizona, Stone began acting as a child, in a theater {{production}} of <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Willows in 2000. As a teenager, she relocated to Los Angeles with her mother, and made her television debut in VH1's In Search of the New Partridge Family (2004), a reality show that produced only an unsold pilot. After small television roles, she won a Young Hollywood Award for her film debut in Superbad (2007), and received positive media attention {{for her role in}} Zombieland (2009). The 2010 teen comedy Easy A was Stone's first starring role and earned her nominations for the BAFTA Rising Star Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. This breakthrough was followed with further success in the romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love and the drama The Help (both 2011).|$|E
5|$|Stone {{was drawn}} to acting {{from the age of}} four; she wanted a career in sketch comedy initially, but shifted her focus toward musical theater, and took voice lessons for several years. Her acting debut, at the age of 11, came in a stage {{production}} of <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Willows, playing the part of Otter. The actress was homeschooled for two years, during which time she appeared in sixteen productions at Phoenix's Valley Youth Theatre—including The Princess and the Pea, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat—and performed with the theater's improvisational comedy troupe. Around this time, she traveled to Los Angeles and auditioned unsuccessfully for a role in Nickelodeon's All That. Her parents later sent her for private acting lessons with a local acting coach, who had worked at the William Morris Agency in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is {{the debut}} studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, {{and the only}} one made under {{founding}} member Syd Barrett's leadership. The album, named after the title of chapter seven of Kenneth Grahame's <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Willows and featuring a kaleidoscopic cover photo of the band taken by Vic Singh, was recorded from February to May 1967 and released on 5 August 1967.

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} April 1947, Hordern {{accepted}} the small part of Captain Hoyle in Richard Llewellyn's comic drama film Noose. Two other roles occurred that year: as Maxim de Winter in a television adaption of Daphne du Maurier's novel Rebecca, followed by {{the part of a}} detective in Good-Time Girl, alongside Dennis Price and Jean Kent. The following year he took part in three plays: Peter Ustinov's The Indifferent Shepherd, which appeared at the newly opened Q Theatre in Brentford, West London; Ibsen's Ghosts; and an adaptation of <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Willows at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon in which he portrayed the part of the blustery, eccentric Mr Toad.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the twentieth}} century, access to Padstow's harbour was via a narrow channel between the Doom Bar and the cliffs at Stepper Point, a {{difficult}} passage for sailing ships to navigate especially in north-westerly gales when the cliffs would {{cut off the}} wind. Many ships were wrecked on the Doom Bar, despite the installation of mooring rings and capstans on the cliffs and quarrying away part of Stepper Point to improve <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early twentieth century the main channel {{moved away from the}} cliffs, and continued dredging has made it much safer for boats, but deaths have occurred on the bar as recently as 1997.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00 on 12 November Amazone and Elisa sailed from Le Havre {{to unite}} {{with the force}} at Cherbourg, hoping to evade the {{blockade}} in the darkness. They successfully passed the patrolling Diana and Niobe but were spotted sailing northwest at 00:30 by the British ships which gave chase, Niobe turning inshore {{in an attempt to}} cut off the French line of advance. With <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northeast, the French frigates were unable to pass Cape Barfleur under pursuit, and Rosseau instead turned his squadron towards the Iles Saint-Marcouf at 04:00, using superior local knowledge to bypass the pursuing British ships. The heavily fortified islands had been under British control during the French Revolutionary Wars, but reverted to the French at the Peace of Amiens in 1802. Diana and Niobe attempted to intercept the French frigates before they came under the shelter of the guns, but were only able to fire two long-distance broadsides at the trailing Elisa.|$|E

5|$|Born in 1933 in Anderson, Indiana, Phyllis Reynolds Naylor {{was raised}} in Indiana and Illinois in the 1930s during the Great Depression. During her {{childhood}} she was hardly given any toys. Instead, with her parents reading to her every night, books formed {{a major part of}} her early years—"the happiest part". Her parents read a variety of literature to her, including Bible stories, <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Willows, and Mark Twain's novels, until she was 14. After she became a parent, she read to her children in the mornings because of their evening activities. At 16, Naylor wrote a short story for a church magazine, and in her early thirties she published her first book. She has published over 100 books. When she wrote and published Shiloh, her 65th novel, she was living in Bethesda, Maryland with her husband Rex, a speech pathologist whom she married in May 1960. She has two adult sons and four grandchildren.|$|E

40|$|We {{point out}} that a high number density of stars <b>in</b> <b>the</b> core of a dense star cluster such as the central stellar cluster at the Galactic center, where many stars possess strong stellar <b>winds,</b> should result <b>in</b> {{collisions}} of those <b>winds.</b> <b>The</b> <b>wind</b> collisions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dense stellar core at the Galactic center would result in production of strong X-ray flares with the rate of ∼ 10 − 4 (Nw/ 10 3) 2 yr − 1 and duration of ∼ 1 week, where Nw {{is the number of}} <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> producing stars <b>in</b> <b>the</b> core. Presence of a massive black hole would enhance the stellar density around it and would make collisions of <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> core substantially more frequent. Collisions of <b>the</b> stellar <b>winds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cluster have also a number of interesting observable implications, including generation of γ-rays by particles accelerated by the shocks from <b>the</b> colliding <b>winds.</b> These processes are also expected to be relevant to compact regions of intense star formation elsewhere...|$|R
