In October 2008, Gambira's lawyer, Aung <b>Thein,</b> resigned from his case, saying that the military government would not allow him the materials to prepare an adequate defence. On one occasion, Gambira refused to appear in court himself, stating that the trial of a forcibly disrobed monk was disrespectful to Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|On July31, President of Myanmar <b>Thein</b> Sein {{declared}} disaster {{areas for}} Chin and Rakhine states and for Sagaing and Magway regions. On August4, the government issued {{an appeal to}} the international community for assistance. In response, the government of Australia provided A$3million, and the United States Agency for International Development sent US$600,000. Neighboring Bangladesh donated $800,000 worth of medicine, water kits, and other supplies. Assistance from other countries included $775,000 from the United Kingdom, $142,202 from nearby Thailand, $100,000 from the Singapore Red Cross, and $300,000 from China.|$|E

25|$|On February 1 as the {{quadripartite meeting}} was taking place, the NLD {{publicly}} announced that <b>Thein</b> Lwin, its central committee member {{and the chairman}} of National Network for Education Reform, did not represent the party or its policies. It further mentioned in the statement that the NLD could take legal action against <b>Thein</b> Lwin for violating party rules regarding asking permission to participate in organizations independent of the party. Han Tha Myint, a central committee member of the NLD, also stated that Aung San Suu Kyi, the chairman of the NLD, did not support <b>Thein</b> Lwin as his actions could be construed as representative of the party’s stance on the issue. The ACDE promptly responded to that statement the next day by accusing the NLD for attempting to undermine the student protests at such a critical moment.|$|E
25|$|On February 9, the NLD {{released}} {{a statement saying that}} <b>Thein</b> Lwin, a member of NNER, was suspended from his position in the party’s central executive committee indefinitely. Another statement released by the NLD also announced the suspension of its Central Education Committee chaired by <b>Thein</b> Lwin. Aung San Su Kyi, the leader of the NLD, also said that it was a conflict of interest for a party member to be involved in an organization independent of the party. <b>Thein</b> Lwin responded by saying that he believed “student demands are righteous”. The statement came out as <b>Thein</b> Lwin along with other education advocates and student representatives attended the third quadripartite meeting with Deputy Minister of Education and reached an agreement to resume further talks on February 11 at Yangon Region Parliamentary building. At the same time, the students marching from Mandalay were approaching Pyay in Bago Region and were about a mile away from a barricade set up by 200 riot police and 100 Swan Arr Shin members. About 300 residents from nearby towns accompanied the students to protect them due to rumors of a possible crackdown. Meanwhile, the students marching from Tanintharyi Region arrived in Mawlamyine, the capital of Mon State the day before and held several demonstrations joined by the locals (<b>thein</b> lwin suspended). The third group leaving from Ayeyarwady Region reportedly arrived in Maubin, about 100 miles away from Yangon. In Dedaye, in the northwest of Maubin and about 56 miles from Yangon, around 400 riot police were deployed. The student protesters called for negotiations with the police in case of a potential confrontation and the police informed that they were there to provide security not to stop the protests. Moreover, the fourth group of around 300 students left Pakokku, following the path that the group from Mandalay took several weeks ago.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} march began, President <b>Thein</b> Sein, {{announced}} in a state-run newspaper on Jan 21 that the parliament should reconsider {{some parts of}} the National Education Law and said that amendments would lead to stability and allow the students to resume their studies.|$|E

25|$|Myanmar's {{government}} {{has been accused of}} crimes against the Muslim Rohingya minority that are alleged to amount to genocide. It has been alleged that Rohingya are the primary targets of hate crimes and discrimination amounting to genocide fueled by extremist nationalist Buddhist monks and <b>Thein</b> Sein's government. Muslim groups have claimed that they were subjected to genocide, torture, arbitrary detention, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.|$|E
25|$|The group {{continued}} touring to widely receptive {{audiences in}} some Asian countries, {{notably in the}} Philippines {{where they have a}} loyal fan base, throughout 2008. That year, they co-headlined the first rock concert ever performed at the Angkor Wat Temple. In late 2008, they participated in an MTV EXIT concert in Bangkok done to raise awareness on human trafficking. The band played along with Burmese pop star Phyu Phyu Kyaw <b>Thein</b> and various Thai-based celebrities.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, The National League for Democracy, {{the main}} {{opposition}} party led by Aung San Su Kyi, was rather {{silent on the}} issue. In fact, the party distanced itself from the student protests stating explicitly {{that they would not}} follow National Network for Education Reform and did not endorse its criticism of the law (behind the student protests). Moreover, Phyo Min <b>Thein,</b> one the NLD’s Pyithu Hluttaw Representatives, said that the current law was “practical” given the political constraints.|$|E
25|$|A puppet {{government}} {{was set up}} during the occupation by the Japanese on 1 August 1943. Soe had gone underground in the Irrawaddy Delta to organize armed resistance soon after the invasion, and Than Tun as Minister of Land and Agriculture was able to pass on intelligence to Soe. Other communist leaders Thakins <b>Thein</b> Pe and Tin Shwe made contact in July 1942 with the exiled colonial government in Simla, India. In January 1944 at a secret meeting near Dedaye in the Delta, the CPB successfully held its First Congress chaired by Soe.|$|E
25|$|Rohingya NGOs {{have accused}} the Burmese {{army and police}} of {{playing a role in}} {{targeting}} Rohingya through mass arrests and arbitrary violence though an in-depth research by the International Crisis Group reported that members of both communities were grateful for the protection provided by the military. While the government response was praised by the United States and European Union, NGOs were more critical, citing discrimination of Rohingyas by the previous military government. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and several human rights groups rejected the President <b>Thein</b> Sein's proposal to resettle the Rohingya abroad.|$|E
25|$|On February 3, {{in front}} of Ministry of Education {{headquarter}} in Naypyidaw, the students announced {{that they would be}} resuming their nationwide protests. Earlier that day, the government declared that the second quadripartite meeting was postponed after refusing to allow extra attendees who came along with the students to the meeting. During the meeting, Aung Min read out a letter, which he claimed to have just received from the president. The letter suggested that the meeting should be postponed and the government representatives decided to follow the president’s advice after a discussion. That early afternoon, the Ministry of Information released photos of government delegates standing in an empty room with a caption saying that the students did not show up to the meeting. Later that day, the government announced that the meeting would be postponed until February 12. The student leaders, meanwhile, declared that they have students ready to continue marching to Yangon from different parts of the country, including Mandalay in the north, Pathein in the southwest and Dawei in the south. On the same day, Aung San Su Kyi confirmed her opinions on the current protests, asking <b>Thein</b> Lwin to resign from his position in the central executive committee if he wanted to pursue his work with NNER. Initially silent on the topic, U <b>Thein</b> Lwin said in a press conference on February 3 that he would accept NLD's decision.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, several {{makers have}} begun to market compact B/C trombones that are {{especially}} well suited for young children learning to play the trombone who cannot reach the outer slide positions of full-length instruments. The fundamental note of the unenhanced length is C, but the short valved attachment that puts the instrument in B is open when the trigger is not depressed. While such instruments have no seventh slide position, C and B natural may be comfortably accessed on {{the first and second}} positions by using the trigger. A similar design ("Preacher model") was marketed by C.G. Conn in the 1920s, also under the Wurlitzer label. Currently, B/C trombones are available from many manufacturers, including German makers Günter Frost, <b>Thein</b> and Helmut Voigt, as well as the Yamaha Corporation.|$|E
25|$|Thant {{had three}} brothers: Khant, Thaung, and Tin Maung. He {{was married to}} Daw <b>Thein</b> Tin. Thant had two sons, but lost both; Maung Bo died in infancy, and Tin Maung Thant fell from a bus {{during a visit to}} Yangon. Tin Maung Thant's funeral procession, which was {{attended}} by dignitaries, was grander than that of the state funeral of Commodore Than Pe, a member of the 17-man Revolutionary Council and minister of health and education. Thant was survived by a daughter, an adopted son, five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren (three girls and two boys). His only grandson, Thant Myint-U, is a historian and a former senior official in the UN's Department of Political Affairs and the author of The River of Lost Footsteps, in part a biography of Thant.|$|E
25|$|While {{working in}} Rangoon, Burma (Myanmar), K. R. Narayanan met Ma Tint Tint, whom he later married in Delhi on 8 June 1951. Ma Tint Tint {{was active in}} the YWCA and on hearing that Narayanan was a student of Laski, {{approached}} him to speak on political freedom before her circle of acquaintances. Their marriage needed a special dispensation from Nehru as per Indian law, because Narayanan was in the IFS and she was a foreigner. Ma Tint Tint adopted the Indian name Usha and became an Indian citizen. Usha Narayanan (1923–2008) worked on several social welfare programs for women and children in India and completed her Masters in Social Work from Delhi School of Social Work. She also translated and published several Burmese short stories; a collection of translated stories by <b>Thein</b> Pe Myint, titled Sweet and Sour, appeared in 1998. She is the second woman of foreign origin to have become the First Lady. They have two daughters, Chitra Narayanan (Indian ambassador to Switzerland and The Holy See) and Amrita.|$|E
25|$|On 26 June 1954, Douglas DC-3 was hijacked {{by members}} of the Karen National Defense Organization (KNDO, later the Karen National Liberation Army). After the killing of Saw Ba U Gyi in 1950, the first {{president}} of the Karen National Union (KNU), the group sought to regain both a political initiative and financial leverage. Three KNDO members - Major Saw Kyaw Aye, Captain <b>Thein</b> Kyaw and Captain A Nyein - planned to hijack a plane, and use it to smuggle illegal weapons. They successfully hijacked the plane, and forced its British pilot Captain A.E. Hare to land on a deserted beach, after other group members had failed to build a suitable temporary runway in Karen. Finding 700,000 Burmese kyat in metal chests in the cargo, cash being transported between bank branches, they confiscated this and then let the plane take off. Censorship banned reporting of the story for over 50 years, but in April 2014 it was the subject of the book The World's First Hijacking, and is being developed into a Hollywood-produced film under the same title.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the student}} leaders of the {{uprising}} became lifelong activists and human rights leaders. Many of the same activists played a role 19 years later during the 2007 Saffron Revolution. The 88 Generation Students Group, named for the events of 8 August 1988, organised {{one of the first}} protests that eventually culminated in the Saffron Revolution. They were arrested, however, prior to large-scale demonstrations and given lengthy prison sentences of up to 65 years. Included in these arrests are prominent figures such as Min Ko Naing, Mya Aye, Htay Kywe, Mie Mie, Ko Ko Gyi, Pyone Cho, Min Zeyar, Ant Bwe Kyaw, and Nilar <b>Thein.</b> Though not an 88 Generation Students Group member, a solo protester Ohn Than also joined the demonstration. All of them were released in a general amnesty in 2012. They continue to work as politicians and human rights activists in Myanmar. They also campaigned for the National League for Democracy in the 2015 Elections. Pyone Cho, one of the main leaders of the 88 Generation, was elected to the House of Representatives in the 2015 Election.|$|E
25|$|In {{the play}} Thaka Ala, {{published}} {{just before the}} 1962 coup, U Nu paints an extremely ugly picture of corruption both amongst the high-ranking politicians in power {{at the time as}} well as among the communist leaders who were gaining ascendancy. This is a play in the vernacular, a genre that hardly exists in Burmese literature. A translation into English was published in instalments in the Guardian newspaper. The play was critical of the current state of politics in Burma at the time (around 1960) and in this critical stance it resembles <b>Thein</b> Pe Myint's The Modern Monk (Tet Hpongyi in Burmese). Like The Modern Monk, it deals with scandalous sexual liaisons not much in keeping with traditional modes of Burmese behaviour.One of the greatest female writers of the Post-colonial period is Journalgyaw Ma Ma Lay. Khin Myo Chit was another important writer, who wrote, among her works, The 13-Carat Diamond (1955), which was translated into many languages. The journalist Ludu U Hla was the author of numerous volumes of ethnic minority folklore, novels about inmates in U Nu-era jails, and biographies of people working in different occupations. The Prime Minister U Nu himself wrote several politically oriented plays and novels.|$|E

Gambira stated {{in an interview that}} his imprisonment had left him with depression, frequent headaches, and failing memory; however, he said he had difficulty finding a doctor willing to treat him, for fear that it would draw government reprisals. He attempted to leave the country for treatment, but could not get the necessary paperwork. Gambira told reporters that his organisation would continue to boycott the government despite the amnesty: [...] "The government has transformed its external appearance into a civilian one but their efforts to implement democracy are still rather weak, while many cases of human rights violations continue".|$|E

2500|$|Myanmar National Education Law (...) , {{enacted on}} 30 September 2014, is {{designed}} to reform the country’s outdated education system.

2500|$|In February 1946 Thakin Soe {{denounced the}} leadership, {{accusing them of}} Browderism, the form of {{revisionism}} espoused by Earl Browder, leader of the American Communist Party, who proposed that armed struggle {{would no longer be}} necessary, as world fascism and imperialism had been weakened, making constitutional methods a real option to achieve [...] "national liberation". <b>Thein</b> Pe, who had replaced Soe as secretary general, was the leader responsible for the policy paper on strategy entitled Toward Better Mutual Understanding and Greater Cooperation written in India and adopted at the party's Second Congress at Bagaya Road, Rangoon in July 1945. Soe broke away from the CPB to form a splinter group called the Red Flag Communist Party. The majority remained with Thakins Than Tun and <b>Thein</b> Pe and continued to co-operate with the AFPFL; the main party became known as the White Flag communists although the title has never been officially accepted. During negotiations the British noticed that Than Tun was the thinker behind Aung San as he referred to his brother-in-law repeatedly for his opinion. Also dubbed 'Thein-Than Communists' in the popular press, in the end they failed to achieve 'Leftist Unity' with Aung San and the Socialists led by U Nu and Kyaw Nyein within the AFPFL.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 January 2013, {{immediately}} {{prior to}} an international donors conference in Myanmar, President <b>Thein</b> Sein announced a unilateral ceasefire in the war between {{the army and the}} KIO. The ceasefire was said to take effect the following day, on 19 January, but light fighting was also reported the following day and a full-scale government assault was reportedly launched on 20 January and included [...] "sustained mortar and artillery fire" [...] followed by [...] "hundreds of Burmese troops" [...] storming a KIA base on the outskirt's of rebel-held town of Laiza.|$|E
2500|$|The {{government}} of <b>Thein</b> Sein {{was reported to}} be under pressure from [...] "political and business circles" [...] who believed the [...] "escalating conflict would undermine Myanmar’s emergence from decades of diplomatic isolation" [...] and had passed a resolution in parliament calling on Min Aung Hlaing, the military’s commander-in-chief, to scale down the war. Min Aung Hlaing responded by stating that the military would only carry out attacks only in [...] "self-defense"—the rationale it has consistently given since December 2011 for prosecuting a war against the KIA and the rationale it gave for allowing airstrikes on rebel positions starting on 26 December 2012.|$|E
2500|$|On February 22, at a {{press conference}} in Yangon, the {{students}} accused the government for violating the agreements as the government submitted the Ministry of Education’s version of the amendment bill alongside with the one agreed upon at the quadripartite meetings. Earlier that week on February 17, the Ministry of Education presented two proposed bills, claiming that the ministry crafted one of them. The bill that the Ministry of Education proposed, according to <b>Thein</b> Lwin, the chairman of NNER, was the one presented at first at the quadripartite meeting but agreed to be discarded by the government. The competing drafts in the parliament might delay the process and could take up to a month according to Phyo Min <b>Thein,</b> a member of parliament representing the NLD. [...] Despite concerns from the students, the two proposed bills seemed to have some features in common. They both stated that schools and universities will be independent from the National Education Commission; that the school system would cater to students with disabilities; that the students would have the right to choose subjects they want to study except for those mandatory to pass the matriculation; that students and teachers would have the right to form unions and if necessary with financial help from university administration; that schools would be able to choose which language to teach; and that the government would increase the funding to 20% of the national budget in five years.|$|E
2500|$|In 1932 {{he managed}} {{to take over the}} {{publication}} of the Kyipwayay (Progress/Growth) magazine after a false start by the chairman U <b>Thein.</b> He had wanted to be a writer and publisher and grabbed the opportunity. The magazine was a success with most of the day's famous writers on board and with an editorial remit of educating young people in self-improvement, health and moral discipline in the struggle for independence and for building a new united Burma. Regular columns such as Maha Swe's Nei Thu Yein's Fearless Doctrine and Theippan Maung Wa's Letter from Maung Than Gyaung attracted a large readership. The Kyipwayay became the vehicle for a new style and content in Burmese literature known as Hkit san (Testing the Age), a movement started most notably by Theippan Maung Wa, Nwe Soe, Zawgyi, Min Thu Wun,Maung Thuta, Maung Htin and Mya Kaytu. He also wrote articles assuming the pen names Kyipwayay Maung Hla and Maung Kan Kaung. A devout Buddhist and [...] non-violent reformist at heart, he made friends with and his home became a favourite haunt of many politicians such as [...] Aung San, Thakin Than Tun, Thakin Zin and Thakin Ba Koe as well as writers such as Maha Swe, Dagon Taya, Zawana, P Moe Nin, Thukha, Maung Htin and Dr Maung Hpyuu, journalists such as Thuriya U <b>Thein</b> Maung, cartoonists U Ba Galay, U Hein Soon and U Ba Gyan, artist U Ohn Lwin and weightlifters Ka-ya bala U Shein, U Zaw Weik and U Ne Win. The Thuriya (Sun) newspaper was where he had started as a budding writer and where he appeared to have learnt the rudiments of journalism and publishing.

Some of the pagodas are still to be seen, and in later ages the Burmese would point to them as proof of their claim to rule those countries still. Following {{in the footsteps of}} Dhammazedi, he supervised mass ordinations at the Kalyani <b>Thein</b> at Pegu in his orthodox Theravada Buddhism in the name of purifying the religion. He prohibited all human and animal sacrifices throughout the kingdom. The ban also extended to the foreign settlers’ animal sacrifices such as the Eid al-Adha.|$|E
