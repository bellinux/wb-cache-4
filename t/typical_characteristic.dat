Approximately 21m wide by 72m long, it included lawns, gardens with Australian plants, {{and a large}} pond with fountain jets to cool the surrounding air. Langer envisioned the forecourt as an important public space for visitors to Spring Hill and to the building.|$|E
25|$|The AV Group {{also had}} its {{workshop}} in Capua. Of particular importance is the Whiteface-Frignano Painter, {{one of the}} first in this group. His <b>typical</b> <b>characteristic</b> is the use of additional white paint to depict the faces of women. This group favoured domestic scenes, women and warriors. Multiple figures are rare, usually there is only one figure each on the front and back of the vase, sometimes only the head. Garments are usually drawn casually.|$|E
25|$|Nanofluidic {{circuitry}} is a nanotechnology {{aiming for}} control of fluids in nanometer scale. Due {{to the effect of}} an electrical double layer within the fluid channel, the behavior of nanofluid is observed to be significantly different compared with its microfluidic counterparts. Its <b>typical</b> <b>characteristic</b> dimensions fall within the range of 1–100nm. At least one dimension of the structure is in nanoscopic scale. Phenomena of fluids in nano-scale structure are discovered to be of different properties in electrochemistry and fluid dynamics.|$|E

25|$|The most <b>typical</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the castros is its {{defensive}} system. The inhabitants {{had chosen}} to start living in the hill {{as a way of}} protection against attacks and lootings by rival tribes. The Cividade was erected at 152 metres height (about 500 feet), allowing an excellent position to monitor the entire region. One of the sides, the north, was blocked by São Félix Hill, where a smaller castro was built, the Castro de Laundos from the 2nd century B.C., that served as a surveillance post.|$|E
25|$|The most <b>typical</b> <b>characteristic</b> is its {{defensive}} system. The inhabitants {{had chosen}} to start living in the hill {{as a way of}} protection against attacks and looting by rival tribes. The migrations of Turduli and Celtici proceeding from the South of the Iberian Peninsula heading North were the reason for the improvement of the defensive systems of the castros around 500 BC. Cividade de Terroso {{is one of the most}} heavily defensive castros, given that the acropolis was surrounded by three rings of walls. The defensive perimeter seems to include a ditch of about 1 metre (3 feet 3inches) of depth and width in base of the hill and a surveillance post in São Félix Hill.|$|E
25|$|Sauternes are {{characterized}} by the balance of sweetness with the zest of acidity. Some common flavor notes include apricots, honey, peaches but with a nutty note, which is a <b>typical</b> <b>characteristic</b> of noble semillon itself (cf. Australian noble (late-harvest) semillon). The finish can resonate on the palate for several minutes. Sauternes are some of longest-lived wines, with premium examples from exceptional vintages properly kept having the potential to age well even beyond 100 years. Sauternes typically starts out with a golden, yellow color that becomes progressively darker as it ages. Some wine experts, like Ed McCarthy and Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan, believe that only once the wine reaches the color of an old copper coin has it started to develop its more complex and mature flavors.|$|E

500|$|Also in the 2010s, a metal style called [...] "djent" [...] {{developed}} as a spinoff of standard progressive metal. Djent music uses rhythmic and technical complexity, heavily distorted, palm-muted guitar chords, syncopated riffs and polyrhythms alongside virtuoso soloing. Another <b>typical</b> <b>characteristic</b> {{is the use of}} extended range seven, eight, and nine-string guitars. Djent bands include Periphery, TesseracT and Textures.|$|E
2500|$|In relationships, many OA members attested {{trying to}} control their own lives and those of others. Paradoxically, an OA member's {{experience}} of themselves was also characterized by strong feelings of personal failure, dependence, despair, stress, nervousness, low self-esteem, powerlessness, lack of control, self-pity, frustration and loneliness. As part of these feelings, the self was perceived as being both a victim of circumstances and a victim of the attitude of others. Many members viewed this lack of self-esteem as deriving from their external appearance. Harsh self-criticism is a <b>typical</b> <b>characteristic,</b> accompanied by feelings of [...] "I don't deserve it" [...] and [...] "I'm worth less than others." [...] Such feelings were found to have a dominant influence on relationships with others.|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} of Chalcidian vases began suddenly around 560 BC. To date, no precursors have been identified. After 50 years, around 510 BC, {{it was already}} over. About 600 vases have survived, and 15 painters or painter groups have been so far identified. These vases are characterized by high quality pottery work. The glossy slip which covers them is usually pitch-black after firing. The clay has an orange color. Red and white opaque colores were generously used in the painting, as was scoring to produce interior details. The index form is the neck amphora, accounting {{for a quarter of}} all known vases, but there are also eye cups, oenochoes and hydria; other vessel types being less common. Lekanis and cups in the Etruscan style are exceptions. The vases are economical and stringent in construction. The [...] "Chalcidian cup foot" [...] is a <b>typical</b> <b>characteristic.</b> It is sometimes copied in black-figure Attic vases, less often in red-figured vases.|$|E

2500|$|Religious {{architecture}} {{was very}} prestigious; churches {{were among the}} most decorated and solid edifices in the country. Throughout the 13th and 14th centuries, basilicas were replaced with cruciform, domed churches with one or three naves. The church's exteriors [...] had rich, decorative ornamentation with alternating belts of stone and brickwork. They were further decorated with green, yellow, and brown ceramic pieces. This [...] feature is seen in several churches in Messembria, including the Church of St John Aliturgetos and the 14th century Church of Christ Pantocrator—which had rows of blind arches, four-leaved floral motifs, triangular ornaments, circular turquoise ceramics, and brick swastika friezes running along the external walls. Every church in Tsarevets—over 20—and many of the 17 churches in Trapezitsa were decorated with similar techniques. A rectangular belfry above the narthex is a <b>typical</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the architecture of the Tarnovo Artistic School. Some churches, such as Holy Mother of God in Asen's Fortress built during the Byzantine rule, were reconstructed with belfries.|$|E
2500|$|Trabzon has {{a climate}} {{typical of the}} Black Sea region with {{plentiful}} precipitation. Under the Köppen climate classification, it has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa) Summers are warm and humid, and the average maximum temperature is around [...] in August. Winters are cool and damp, and the lowest average minimum temperature is around [...] in January. Trabzon's summers are warmer than oceanic classifications, but the narrow fluctuations in temperature renders a significant influence from the sea. As with other major cities on the Black Sea coast of Turkey, Trabzon is situated right on the waterfront, thus allowing for the additional 1-2 degrees Celsius enough to surpass the threshold to be classified as subtropical. In comparison, only 1 or 2 percent of the province is classified as subtropical, the majority being oceanic (Köppen: Cfb) followed by humid continental climate (Köppen: Dfb), due to the immediate elevation increase starting from the coast, a <b>typical</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the Black Sea coast of Turkey. Trabzon's weather station also sees tendencies of a mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa), but with only one month below 40mm rainfall in summer it just fails to qualify.|$|E
