25|$|To {{get access}} to the show courts, fans will {{normally}} have to queue overnight. This is done by fans {{from all over the}} world and, although considered vagrancy, is part of the Wimbledon experience in itself. The All-England Club allows overnight queuing and provides toilet and water facilities for campers. Early in the morning when the line moves towards the Grounds, stewards walk along the line and hand out wristbands that are colour-coded to the specific court. The wrist band (and payment) is exchanged at the ticket office for the ticket when the grounds open. General admission to the grounds gives access to the outer courts and is possible without queuing overnight. Tickets returned by people leaving early go on sale at 2:30pm and <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>goes</b> to charity. Queuing for the show courts ends after the quarter finals have been completed.|$|E
25|$|Multimillion-dollar {{investments}} {{beginning in}} the 1990s by the World Bank have reclaimed desert and turned the Ica Valley in Peru, one of the driest places on earth, into the largest supplier of asparagus in the world. However, the constant irrigation has caused a rapid drop in the water table, in some places as much as eight meters per year, {{one of the fastest}} rates of aquifer depletion in the world. The wells of small farmers and local people are beginning to run dry and the water supply for the main city in the valley is under threat. As a cash crop, asparagus has provided jobs for local people, but most of <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>goes</b> to the buyers, mainly the British. A 2010 report concluded that the industry is not sustainable and accuses investors, including the World Bank, of failing to take proper responsibility for the effect of their decisions on the water resources of poorer countries. Diverting water from the headwaters of the Ica River to asparagus fields has also led to a water shortage in the mountain region of Huancavelica, where indigenous communities make a marginal living herding.|$|E

2500|$|Movie {{production}} incentives are tax benefits offered on a state-by-state basis throughout the United States to encourage in-state film production. [...] These incentives came {{about in the}} 1990s {{in response to the}} flight of movie productions to other countries such as Canada. [...] Since then, states have offered increasingly competitive incentives to lure productions away from other states. [...] The structure, type, and size of the incentives vary from state to state. [...] Many include tax credits and exemptions, and other incentive packages include cash grants, fee-free locations, or other perks. [...] Proponents of these programs point to increased economic activity and job creation as justification for the credits. [...] Others argue that the cost of the incentives outweighs the benefits and say that <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>goes</b> primarily to out-of-state talent rather than in-state cast and crew members.|$|E
2500|$|A major hit for Blethyn {{came with}} Joe Wright's Pride & Prejudice, a 2005 {{adaptation}} of the same-titled novel by Jane Austen. Starring alongside Keira Knightley and Donald Sutherland, Blethyn played Mrs. Bennet, a fluttery mother of five sisters who desperately schemes to marry her daughters off to men of means. During promotion of the film, she noted of her portrayal of the character: [...] "I've always thought she had a real problem and shouldn't be made fun of. She's pushy with a reason. As soon as Mr. Bennet dies, all <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>goes</b> down the male line; she has to save her daughters from penury." [...] With both a worldwide gross of over US$121 million and several Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations, the film became a critical and commercial success, spawning Blethyn another BAFTA Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century a new room in the pub was established: the saloon. Beer establishments {{had always}} {{provided}} entertainment of some sort—singing, gaming or sport. Balls Pond Road in Islington was named after an establishment run by a Mr Ball that had a duck pond at the rear, where drinkers could, for a fee, go out and take a potshot at the ducks. More common, however, was a card room or a billiard room. The saloon was a room where for an admission fee or a higher price of drinks, singing, dancing, drama or comedy was performed and drinks would be served at the table. From this came the popular music hall form of entertainment—a show consisting of a variety of acts. A most famous London saloon was the Grecian Saloon in The Eagle, City Road, which is still famous because of a nursery rhyme: [...] "Up and down the City Road / In and out The Eagle / That's the way <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>goes</b> / Pop goes the weasel." [...] This meant that the customer had spent all his money at The Eagle, and needed to pawn his [...] "weasel" [...] to get some more. The meaning of the [...] "weasel" [...] is unclear but the two most likely definitions are: a flat iron used for finishing clothing; or rhyming slang for a coat (weasel and stoat).|$|E
