5|$|A {{follow-up}} to , Battle for Naboo is a fast-paced, arcade-style action game. Each of the game's 15levels introduces mission objectives {{that must be}} completed to progress to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level.</b> Enemy aircraft are primarily composed of Trade Federation Droid starfighters and air mines. Ground defenses are more varied and include battle and destroyer droids, laser and missile turrets, Armored Assault Tanks (AATs), Multi-troop transports (MTTs), gunboats and Single trooper aerial platform (STAPs).|$|E
5|$|As {{the plant}} grows, it will sprout leaves; these both {{increase}} {{the growth rate}} and increase its vulnerability to the insects.

So his requirements to get to Paris are, like, beyond platinum editions; they're, like, beyond ultra-platinum editions; they're like diamond editions. So we love Snoop and we wish he had been here, but I think shooting him in L.A. will be good because we'll have more time, more control. He probably would have gotten really mobbed in the streets here anyway.|$|E

5|$|Jedi Knight is {{primarily}} a first-person shooter, although it does offer {{the choice of a}} third-person view. The game consists of twenty-one levels with objectives which the player must complete before being able to continue to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level.</b> There are weapons available in each level and after level three, the player has the use of a lightsaber, along with the Force. In addition to being an effective weapon, the lightsaber is also a useful tool for the player, providing light in dark areas, deflecting incoming blaster fire and cutting through some obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Once a room is {{cleared of}} monsters, {{it will remain}} clear, {{allowing}} the player to re-trace {{their way through the}} level, though once they move onto <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level,</b> they cannot return. Along the way, the player can collect money to buy power-ups from shopkeepers, keys to unlock special treasure rooms, and new weapons and power-ups to strengthen their chances against the enemies. The player's health is tracked by a number of hearts; if the character loses all their hearts, the game ends in permadeath and the player must start over from a freshly-generated dungeon. Each floor of the dungeon includes a boss which the player must defeat before continuing to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level.</b> On the sixth of eight floors, the player fights Isaac's mother; after defeating her, Isaac crawls into her womb. Later levels are significantly harder, culminating in a fight against the heart of Isaac's mother on the eighth floor. An optional ninth floor, Sheol contains the boss Satan. Winning the game with certain characters or by certain conditions unlocks new power-ups that might appear in the dungeon or the ability to use one of the other characters. The game tracks the various power-ups that the player has found over time which can be reviewed from the game's menus.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{hierarchical}} architecture ia described for a robot integrated iato a real-time eensory interactive factory control system. In this architecture, high level goals are decomposed through a eucceaeion of levels, each producing strings o? simpler commands to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> lower <b>level.</b> <b>The</b> bottom level generates the drive 8 ignals to the robot actuators. Each control level ia a separate process {{with a limited}} scope of responeibility. Each performs the generic control function of sampling its input and generating appropriate outputs. The input is charactericed by three types of data- a cdmmand from <b>the</b> <b>next</b> higher <b>level,</b> procesaed senaory data, and statue feedback from <b>the</b> <b>next</b> lower <b>level.</b> <b>The</b> outputs are of three types-a command to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> lower <b>level.</b> a request for eensory information to the processing module at the same level, and a status feedback to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> higher <b>level.</b> This paper describes this generic control structure and its implementation in a real-time sensory-interactive control system for a manufacturing facility...|$|R
5|$|The {{basic number}} system {{consists}} of a dot to represent one, and a bar to represent five. By the Postclassic period a shell symbol represented zero; during the Classic period other glyphs were used. The Maya could write any number from 0 to 19 {{using a combination of}} these symbols. The precise value of a numeral was determined by its position; as a numeral shifted upwards, its basic value multiplied by twenty. In this way, the lowest symbol would represent units, the next symbol up would represent multiples of twenty, and the symbol above that would represent multiples of 400, and so on. For example, the number 884 would be written with four dots on the lowest level, four dots on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level</b> up, and two dots on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level</b> after that, to give 4x1, plus 4x20, plus 2x400. Using this system, the Maya were able to record huge numbers. Simple addition could be performed by summing the dots and bars in two columns to give the result in a third column.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} Private Vasili Koslov of the 13th Guards Rifle Division, initially {{involved in}} the defense of Moscow from the advancing German forces. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>level</b> involves the destruction of a German stronghold in Stalingrad during September 1942. The next objective involves battling for strongholds throughout Stalingrad throughout December 1942, including re-connecting cut telephone wires and re-capturing the rail-yard and train-station. The final mission takes place during the final Soviet offensive in Stalingrad in January 1943, which involves the re-capture and defense of city blocks and Stalingrad city hall.|$|E

5|$|Whack Ball is {{comparable}} to Breakout: the player controls a large ball with the Menacer to push a smaller on-screen ball into color-changing bricks that line the wall. One all of the bricks change color, the player moves to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level.</b> Some bricks are power-ups that change the larger ball's size or add extra small balls into play. Players who hit flashing bricks are punished. Inadvertently guiding the ball {{through a hole in}} the wall ends the game.|$|E
5|$|A level ends {{when all}} of the point-scoring objects are gone - either lost down the drain, cleaned by sponges/brushes, eaten by roaches, or absorbed by the bubble. At this point, if the bubble is large enough to have a {{complete}} face, the player moves on to the next level; otherwise, one life is lost and the level must be replayed. In addition, whenever the bubble has a face, the drain flashes green, giving the player a chance to enter it and skip <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level.</b> Entering the drain while the bubble is too small costs one life.|$|E
5|$|According to Kohlberg, someone {{progressing}} to {{a higher}} stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level.</b> Realizing {{the limitations of the}} current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.|$|E

5|$|Applewhite {{began to}} {{emphasize}} a strict hierarchy, teaching that his students needed his guidance, as {{he needed the}} guidance of <b>the</b> <b>Next</b> <b>Level.</b> Zeller notes that this naturally ensured {{that there would be}} no possibility of the group's continuing if Applewhite were to die. A relationship with Applewhite was said to be the only way to salvation; he encouraged his followers to see him as Christ. Zeller states that the group's previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite's role as a mediator. Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings, but, in the 1980s, the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority.|$|E
5|$|As {{with its}} predecessor, {{gameplay}} is centred around Nights {{flying through the}} dreams of the two children.

The team took steps to ensure that the game stayed faithful to the original, while incorporating a variety of new mechanics and features. The game's setting was designed to resemble England, especially parts of London.|$|E

Players may re-attempt unlocked levels as many times as they wish in order to complete them successfully or to earn additional points to get more stars.|$|E
5|$|Gasketball is a part-basketball, part-puzzler shot-matching sports {{video game}} where players flick {{basketballs}} through 2D physics puzzles (with flippers, portals, circular saw blades, and gravity switches) into a basketball hoop. Some puzzles include banking the basketball shot off multiple surfaces {{before making the}} basket. In the HORSE-style games, the player must match the exact setup of the opponent's shot, such as hitting the floor before entering the hoop. In the campaign, players get more points for making the shot without retrying, and have five attempts to make the hoop before moving to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level</b> shamefully.
