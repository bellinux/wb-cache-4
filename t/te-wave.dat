5000|$|The {{figure on}} the right {{presents}} a structure {{referred to as a}} series node. It describes a block of space dimensions , [...] and [...] that consists of four ports. [...] and [...] are the distributed inductance and capacitance of the transmission lines. It is possible to show that a series node is equivalent to a <b>TE-wave,</b> more precisely the mesh current I, the x-direction voltages (ports 1 and 3) and the y-direction voltages (ports 2 and 4) {{may be related to the}} field components , [...] and [...] If the voltages on the ports are considered, , and the polarity from the above figure holds, then the following is valid ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{specific}} features of <b>TE-wave</b> propagation in a structure fabricated by periodic alternating ferrite and semiconductor layers are investigated. Dispersion characteristics of eigenwaves are calculated. The transmission spectra of an electromagnetic wave oblique incident from the uniform medium onto the multilayer periodic ferrite-semiconductor structure is considered. The features of transmission spectra {{of the structure}} with periodicity breakdown are studied. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{designed}} two type binary 2 D subwavelength (wavelength was λ = 10 mm) focus diffractive {{photonic crystal}} lens and calculated the diffraction of plane <b>TE-wave</b> by use FDTD-method (our program in C++). It {{has been shown}} that diffractive photonic crystal lens designs have not an unique solution. Diameter lens was in 5 times more than her width and full width half maximum diameter of focal spot was 0. 48 λ. 1...|$|E
