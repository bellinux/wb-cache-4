5000|$|Pouches hold {{fine cut}} or snuff <b>tobacco</b> <b>in</b> a small, teabag-like pouch.

Dipping <b>tobacco</b> <b>in</b> pouches resemble snus [...] "portions", but the difference between these two products lies in the way the tobacco is processed. Dipping tobacco (including pouched products) undergoes fermentation, whereas <b>tobacco</b> <b>in</b> snus is pasteurized. In addition to regular sized pouches, smaller sized pouches, known as Bandits, are also available in the Skoal brand, Grizzly brand, and Copenhagen brand.|$|R
