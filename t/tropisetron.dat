Therefore, it is of particular interest to investigate the effects of <b>tropisetron</b> on the cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia. Methods A randomised, placebo-controlled trial of <b>tropisetron</b> in patients with schizophrenia was performed.

40|$|Because the {{mechanism}} underlying the analgesic action of acetaminophen remains unclear, we investigated the possible interaction of acetaminophen with central serotonergic pathways. The effects of acetaminophen, <b>tropisetron,</b> {{the combination of}} both drugs, and saline on pain perception and central sensitization in healthy volunteers were compared. Sixteen healthy volunteers were included in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Intracutaneous electrical stimulation (46. 1 ± 19. 1 mA) induced acute pain (numeric rating scale, 6 of 10) and stable areas of hyperalgesia and allodynia. Pain intensities and areas of hyperalgesia and allodynia were regularly assessed before, during, and after a 15 -min infusion of acetaminophen, <b>tropisetron,</b> the combination of both drugs, and saline. Acetaminophen concentrations were measured to rule out any pharmacokinetic interaction. Both acetaminophen and <b>tropisetron</b> led to decreased pain ratings as compared to saline.

Adolescence is a critical period during the development of brain, where exposure to chronic stress during this time is highly associated with the development of depression. In this study, we showed that 4 weeks of juvenile social isolation stress (SIS) provoked depressive-like behaviors in male mice, which was associated with disruption of mitochondrial function and nitric oxide overproduction in the cortical areas. In this study, <b>tropisetron</b> (5 mg/kg) reversed the negative behavioral effects of SIS in male mice.

40|$|Introduction: There is a {{pressing}} need for research {{leading to the}} development of new effective drugs with lower side effects and more efficacy for treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties of 5 -Hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) - 3 receptor antagonists have been shown in in vivo and in vitro studies. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of <b>tropisetron,</b> a 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist, on an immune-based animal model of IBD. Methods: In the present study, the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) model of colitis in the rat was used. Two hours after induction of colitis in rats, <b>tropisetron</b> (2 mg/kg), dexamethasone (1 mg/kg), meta-chlorophenylbiguanide (mCPBG, 5 mg/kg), a 5 -HT 3 receptor agonist, or <b>tropisetron</b> + mCPBG were intraperitoneally (i. p.) administrated for 6 days. Animals were then sacrificed; macroscopic, histological, biochemical (myeloperoxidase [MPO]) assessments and ELISA test (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin- 6 and interleukin- 1 beta) were performed on distal colon samples. Results: <b>Tropisetron</b> or dexamethasone treatment significantly reduced macroscopic and microscopic colonic damages. In addition, a significant reduction in MPO activity and colonic levels of inflammatory cytokines was seen. The beneficial effects of <b>tropisetron</b> were antagonized by concurrent administration of mCPBG.

40|$|Antidepressant-like {{effects of}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine subtype 3 (5 -HT 3) antagonists {{including}} <b>tropisetron</b> and ondansetron have been previously {{demonstrated in the}} literature. It was reported that stimulation of 5 -HT 3 receptors activate the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-cGMP) pathway, which is involved in regulation of behavioral and emotional functions. In our study, treating animals with <b>tropisetron</b> (5, 10, and 30 mg/kg) and ondansetron (0. 01 and 0. 1 µg/kg) significantly decreased the immobility time in forced swimming test (FST) and tail-suspension test (TST). Co-administration of subeffective doses of <b>tropisetron</b> (1 mg/kg) and ondansetron (0. 001 µg/kg) with subeffective dose of l-NAME (10 mg/kg, nonselective NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor) and 7 -nitroindazole (25 mg/kg, neural NOS inhibitor) exerted antidepressant-like effect in FST and TST, while aminoguanidine (50 mg/kg, inducible NOS inhibitor) did not enhance the antidepressant-like effect of 5 -HT 3 antagonists. Besides, l-arginine (750 mg/kg, NO precursor) and sildenafil (5 mg/kg, phosphodiesterase inhibitor) suppressed the anti-immobility effect of 5 -HT 3 antagonists. None of the treatments altered the locomotor behavior of mice in open-field test. Also, hippocampal (but not cortical) nitrite level was significantly lower in <b>tropisetron</b> and ondansetron-treated mice compared with saline-injected mice. Also, co-administration of 7 -nitroindazole with <b>tropisetron</b> or ondansetron caused {{a significant decrease in}} hippocampal nitrite levels.

We report on the efficiency of granisetron and <b>tropisetron,</b> with that of placebo on the prevention of PONV in patients undergoing total thyroidectomy. Methods: One hundred twenty-seven patients were divided into three groups and randomized to receive intravenously, prior to induction of anesthesia, <b>tropisetron</b> 5 mg, or granisetron 3 mg, or normal saline. All patients received additionally 0. 625 mg droperidol. All episodes of postoperative PONV during the first 24 h after surgery were evaluated.

Twenty hours after APAP intoxication, sera alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, hepatic myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and liver histopathological changes were examined. The MAP kinases were also detected by western blotting. Results. Our results showed that <b>tropisetron</b> pretreatment significantly attenuated the acute elevations of the liver enzyme ALT level, hepatic MPO activity, and hepatocytes necrosis in a dose-dependent manner (0. 3 – 10 [*]mg/kg) in APAP-induced hepatotoxicity mice. <b>Tropisetron</b> (1 and 3 [*]mg/kg) suppressed APAP-induced hepatic lipid peroxidation expression and alleviated GSH and SOD depletion. Administration of <b>tropisetron</b> also attenuated the phosphorylation of c-Jun-NH 2 -terminal protein kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) caused by APAP. Conclusion. Our data demonstrated that tropisetron’s hepatoprotective effect was in part correlated with the antioxidant, which were mediated via JNK and ERK pathways on acetaminophen-induced liver injury in mice...|$|E
40|$|Ulcerative colitis (UC) {{involves}} chronic {{inflammation of}} the large intestine. Several agents are used to treat UC, but adverse side effects are remaining problems. We examined the effect of <b>tropisetron</b> as {{a new type of}} drug for UC using a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) -induced model of colitis in mice. We developed a DSS-induced model of colitis and calculated the Disease Activity Index and colon length. We measured myeloperoxidase activity and determined the protein level and mRNA level of cytokines in the colon. DSS-induced colitis was ameliorated by administration of <b>tropisetron</b> and PNU 282987. Pre-administration of methyllycaconitine diminished the suppressive effect of <b>tropisetron</b> upon DSS-induced colitis. These findings suggested that α 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α 7 nAChRs) were related to the suppressive effect of <b>tropisetron</b> on DSS-induced colitis. Additionally, stimulation of α 7 nAChRs decreased the colon level of interleukin- 6 and interferon-γ upon DSS administration. Furthermore, stimulation of α 7 nAChRs decreased macrophage infiltration, with expression of α 7 nAChR increased by DSS administration. These results suggest that the underlying mechanism of this suppressive effect on DSS-induced colitis is via stimulation of α 7 nAChRs and involves suppression of expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. <b>Tropisetron</b> could be a new type of therapeutic agent for UC...|$|E
