40|$|Aim: To {{propose a}} {{hypothesis}} of causal association between central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) and oral contraceptive pills (OCP) Case Summary: A case report-A 22 yr old, female presented with sudden painless {{loss of vision}} in OS [Right Eye] for 1 day. VA [Visual Activity] in OS was PL PR [Perception of Light and Projection of Rays] Faulty with RAPD [Relative Afferent Papillary Defect] with normal for fifteen minutes, given five hundred mg of acetazolamide orally stat, 0. 4 ml of anterior chamber paracentesis done, 5400 IU LMW [Low Molecular Weight] heparin given SC[Subcutaneous] with carbogen inhalation. Retrospectively she was on oral contraceptives (Mala D) for 1 month. She was not hypertensive or diabetic with normal blood, coagulation profile & carotid Doppler. She was evaluated by an intern to find the cause of coagulation disorder and {{was found to be}} normal. On first day FFA [Fundus Florescien Angiography] showed no blockage with normal cilioretinal artery perfusion established. Visual fields after one week showed central <b>tubular</b> <b>vision</b> and OCT [Ocular Coherent Tomography] showed normal fovea. After 2 weeks vision was 20 / 80 with persistent RAPD papilla macular bundle being perfused. Key words...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{demonstrate}} the flexibility, adaptability, {{and efficacy of}} endoscopic endonasal removal of the inferior half of the middle turbinate in a cadaveric study and in surgery {{for the treatment of}} different sphenoid sinus and skull base lesions. Methods: Anatomic Cadaveric Study: Five adult cadaveric heads were studied. Six nostrils of 3 cadavers were studied endoscopically after {{the lower half of the}} middle turbinate was removed. Two adult cadaveric heads underwent bilateral paraseptal sagittal sectioning and were studied after the lower half of the middle turbinate was removed. Sixty-five patients with different sphenoid sinus and skull base-related lesions were treated through this surgical approach. Results: This approach increased surgical exposure, decreased <b>tubular</b> <b>vision,</b> and offered wider anatomic panoramic orientation with 0 -degree and angled endoscopes. In the surgical group, there were no major intra- or postoperative complications. The approach improved exposure, accessibility to the lesion, and permitted good hemostasis, tumor resection, and repair of the skull base defect. Conclusion: The current approach provides a wide surgical field without increasing morbidity. It avoids unnecessary trauma to the other nostril as occurs in a binostril approach. The harvested piece of turbinate tissue is an excellent source of donor material for successful reconstruction of the sellar floor without inducing side effects or complications...|$|E
