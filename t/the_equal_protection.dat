5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause {{served as}} the basis for the {{decision}} in Bush v. Gore (2000), in which the Court ruled that no constitutionally valid recount of Florida's votes in the 2000 presidential election could be held within the needed deadline; the decision effectively secured Bush's victory in the disputed election. In League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry (2006), the Court ruled that House Majority Leader Tom DeLay's Texas redistricting plan intentionally diluted the votes of Latinos and thus violated <b>the</b> <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause {{requires}} {{each state}} to provide equal {{protection under the}} law to all people, including all non-citizens, within its jurisdiction. This clause has been the basis for many decisions rejecting irrational or unnecessary discrimination against people belonging to various groups.|$|E
50|$|A major racial {{issue in}} this case is the concern {{surrounding}} pretext stops. It is believed by profiling a potential suspect gets rid of the need for wrongdoing, violating <b>the</b> <b>Equal</b> <b>Protections</b> Clause. In 1999, United States v. Armstrong shed further light on this issue. It showed that all arrests for crack cocaine in Washington D.C. were African Americans.|$|R

It agreed [...] "with the plaintiffs that the proper comparison is between same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples, {{whether or not they}} are married." [...] It then held that [...] "the benefits programs are facially discriminatory". While it noted a [...] "sliding-scale analysis for <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> challenges in Alaska", it declined to rule on whether a higher standard of review was needed for sexual orientation classifications, as [...] "the benefits programs cannot survive minimum scrutiny" ...|$|R

5|$|Reed v. Reed (1971), which {{struck down}} an Idaho probate law favoring men, {{was the first}} {{decision}} in which the Court ruled that arbitrary gender discrimination violated <b>the</b> <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause. In Craig v. Boren (1976), the Court ruled that statutory or administrative sex classifications had {{to be subjected to}} an intermediate standard of judicial review. Reed and Craig later served as precedents to strike down a number of state laws discriminating by gender.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978) {{that affirmative action}} {{in the form of}} racial quotas in public {{university}} admissions was a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; however, race could be used as one of several factors without violating of <b>the</b> <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause or Title VI. In Gratz v. Bollinger (2003) and Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), the Court considered two race-conscious admissions systems at the University of Michigan. The university claimed that its goal in its admissions systems was to achieve racial diversity. In Gratz, the Court struck down a points-based undergraduate admissions system that added points for minority status, finding that its rigidity violated <b>the</b> <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause; in Grutter, the Court upheld a race-conscious admissions process for the university's law school that used race as one of many factors to determine admission. In Fisher v. University of Texas (2013), the Court ruled that before race {{can be used in a}} public university's admission policy, there must be no workable race-neutral alternative. In Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (2014), the Court upheld the constitutionality of a state constitutional prohibition on the state or local use of affirmative action.|$|E
5|$|This dictum, which {{established}} that corporations enjoyed personhood under <b>the</b> <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause, was repeatedly reaffirmed by later courts. It remained the predominant view throughout the twentieth century, {{though it was}} challenged in dissents by justices such as Hugo Black and William O. Douglas. Between 1890 and 1910, Fourteenth Amendment cases involving corporations vastly outnumbered those involving the rights of blacks, 288 to 19.|$|E

5|$|While a {{defendant}} {{is entitled to}} a fair cross section in the venire, the defendant is not guaranteed a fair cross section in the actual grand jury or petit jury. Yet, <b>the</b> <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> clause does regulate the use of peremptory challenges {{in the selection of}} the petit jury from the venire. In the landmark case of Batson v. Kentucky (1986), the Supreme Court reversed a criminal conviction because of the prosecutor's racially motivated use of peremptory challenges.|$|E
5|$|After the South Carolina Supreme Court {{declined}} to rehear the case, the Capobiancos filed a petition with the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari. Seven entities filed amici curiae briefs with the Supreme Court {{in support of}} hearing the case. This included amici briefs by two former Solicitors General of the United States, Paul Clement {{on behalf of the}} guardian ad litem, and Greg Garre on behalf of the birth mother, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause requires applying strict scrutiny to ICWA’s race-based placement preferences. The American Academy of Adoption Attorneys, the National Council for Adoption, the California State Association of Counties and the Center for Adoption Policy were also among those that submitted briefs.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} argued that this results in the {{different}} treatment of persons in like situations, and thus violates Article 12(1). Although a rational connection exists between the classification adopted and the legislative object, the effect of an under-inclusive classification is to accord different treatment to persons similarly placed. However, the courts have often justified under-inclusiveness on the ground that the legislature is free to recognize degrees of harm, to confine its restrictions to cases where the need is felt to be the greatest, and to advance its policies step by step. Despite this, resort to legislative wisdom to justify under-inclusiveness, if used indiscriminately, may result in the watering down of <b>the</b> <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> guarantee provided by Article 12(1).|$|E

5|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{concurrence}} which {{stated that}} Congress {{was very careful}} to base the changes to the statute on inherent tribal powers and not on a delegation of authority. Kennedy states that {{is all that is}} needed to decide the case, but that the Court went further than was necessary when it decided that Congress had the power under the constitution to authorize tribes to prosecute non-member Indians. Finally, Kennedy was concerned that the court did not address the question of <b>the</b> <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause. He would have reversed the Eighth Circuit without going into the additional detail.|$|E
5|$|On , 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court {{ruled in}} the {{landmark}} case of Obergefell v. Hodges, , holding {{that the fundamental}} right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and <b>the</b> <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Fourteen counties in three Southern states continued to deny marriage licenses for same-sex marriage. The Alabama Supreme Court allowed the probate judges of ten counties in Alabama to deny such marriage licenses, the clerk of one Texas county chose to resign rather than issue such licenses, and the clerks of two counties in Kentucky were not issuing licenses due to paperwork delays. Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear ordered all Kentucky county clerks to begin issuing same-sex marriage licenses immediately.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Melvin {{refused to}} {{transfer}} the case of Taylor Strauder, a black man, to a federal court following his indictment by an all-white Ohio County grand jury {{for the murder of}} his wife. Strauder and his lawyers argued that he would not receive equal treatment in the West Virginia courts due to its all-white jury law and cited the Civil Rights Act of 1866 for a transfer to a federal court. Following Melvin's ruling, Strauder's murder trial proceeded in the Ohio County court in May 1873, and he was inevitably convicted by an all-white jury. Strauder appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia and finally to the Supreme Court of the United States, where his case Strauder v. West Virginia 100 U.S. 303 (1879) was decided on March1, 1880. The Supreme Court held that categorical exclusion of blacks from juries {{for no other reason than}} their race violated <b>the</b> <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause, and Strauder's conviction was overturned due to the Ohio County court's violation of United States constitutional criminal procedure.|$|E

5|$|When the {{election}} returns were tallied on November 7, Bush had won 29 states, including Florida. The {{closeness of the}} Florida outcome led to a recount. The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 9, in the controversial Bush v. Gore ruling, the Court reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision that had ordered a third count, and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on {{the argument that the}} use of different standards among Florida's counties violated <b>the</b> <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast. Although he had received 543,895 fewer individual nationwide votes than Gore, Bush won {{the election}}, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266 (Gore's statewide victories had electoral votes tallying 267; however, one of Gore's pledged electors abstained, rendering the official tally at 266). Bush {{was the first person to}} win an American presidential election with fewer popular votes than another candidate since Benjamin Harrison in 1888.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} Supreme Court {{decisions}} developed the state action constraint on <b>the</b> <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause. The state action theory weakened {{the effect of}} <b>the</b> <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause against state governments, in that the clause was held not to apply to unequal protection of the laws caused in part by complete lack of state action in specific cases, even if state actions in other instances form an overall pattern of segregation and other discrimination.

50|$|In the Katzenbach v. Morgan case, {{decided in}} 1966, the Supreme Court {{concluded}} that Congress can forbid {{practices that are}} not themselves unconstitutional, if the law is aimed at preventing or remedying constitutional violations. On that basis, the Court upheld a provision of the Voting Rights Act that prevented states from using English language literacy tests as qualifications for voting. The Court decided that the law was a valid exercise of Congress's enforcement power under <b>the</b> <b>Equal</b> <b>Protections</b> Clause of Fourteenth Amendment, because it was aimed at remedying state-sponsored discrimination, despite an earlier court finding that a literacy test was not {{in and of itself}} a violation of the 14th Amendment.|$|R
5000|$|Constitutional <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> {{analysis}} applies {{not only}} to challenges against the federal government, but also {{to state and local}} governments. Although <b>the</b> Fourteenth Amendment's <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> Clause applies only to state and local governments, the United States Supreme Court has implied an <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> limitation on <b>the</b> federal government through a process known as [...] "reverse incorporation." [...] As the Fourteenth Amendment applies directly to the states, the incorporation process was unnecessary to hold this restriction against state and local governments. <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection</b> analysis also applies to both legislative and executive action regardless if the action is of a substantive or procedural nature. Judicially crafted (common law) rules are also valid only if they conform to <b>the</b> requirements of <b>Equal</b> <b>Protection.</b> See, e.g., Reed v. Campbell, 476 U.S. 852 (1986).|$|R
