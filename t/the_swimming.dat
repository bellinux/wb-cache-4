5|$|To attract mates, some teleosts produce sounds, {{either by}} stridulation or by {{vibrating}} <b>the</b> <b>swim</b> bladder. In <b>the</b> Sciaenidae, the muscles that attached to <b>the</b> <b>swim</b> blabber {{cause it to}} oscillate rapidly, creating drumming sounds. Marine catfishes, sea horses and grunts stridulate by rubbing together skeletal parts, teeth or spines. In these fish, <b>the</b> <b>swim</b> bladder may act as a resonator. Stridulation sounds are predominantly from 1000–4000 Hz, though sounds modified by <b>the</b> <b>swim</b> bladder have frequencies lower than 1000Hz.|$|R

5|$|Before its {{purchase}} by the Amon Carter Museum of American Art, <b>The</b> <b>Swimming</b> Hole {{appears to}} have undergone seven different conservatory treatments. It may have been restored prior to its inclusion in Eakins' memorial exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1917. A photograph from that time reveals cracks in the glazes and a drip mark, possibly caused by the splash of a caustic liquid. After the painting was acquired by the Fort Worth Art Association, it was often lent out for exhibitions and was damaged as a result. In 1937 it was relined by a private gallery in New York City and the drip was painted out. In 1944 it was relined and restored and in 1947 it was restored again, both times by a private New York dealer. The Brooklyn Museum performed two minor restorations in 1954 and 1957. Although it continued to travel frequently, <b>The</b> <b>Swimming</b> Hole received no comprehensive treatment until 1993.|$|E
5|$|Eakins {{made several}} on-site oil {{sketches}} and photographic studies before painting <b>The</b> <b>Swimming</b> Hole. It is unknown whether the photographs were taken before the oil sketches were produced {{or vice versa}} (or, indeed, whether they were created on the same day).|$|E

50|$|To {{produce the}} croaking sound, special muscles vibrate against <b>the</b> <b>swim</b> bladder. These muscles are called sonic muscle fibres, and run {{horizontally}} along the fish's body {{on both sides}} around <b>the</b> <b>swim</b> bladder, connected to a central tendon that surrounds <b>the</b> <b>swim</b> bladder ventrally. These sonic muscle fibres are repeatedly contracted against <b>the</b> <b>swim</b> bladder to produce the croaking sound that gives drum and croaker their common name, effectively using <b>the</b> <b>swim</b> bladder as a resonating chamber. <b>The</b> sciaenids' large <b>swim</b> bladder is more expansive and branched than other species, which aids in the croaking. In some species the sonic muscle fibres are only present in males. These muscles strengthen during the mating season and are allowed to atrophy {{the rest of the}} time, deactivating the croaking mechanism. In other species, most notably the Atlantic croaker, the croaking mechanism is present in both sexes and remains active year-round. These species are thought to use croaking for communication, such as announcing hazards and location when in turbid water.|$|R

5000|$|In physostomous swim bladders, a {{connection}} is retained between <b>the</b> <b>swim</b> bladder and <b>the</b> gut, the pneumatic duct, allowing {{the fish to}} fill up <b>the</b> <b>swim</b> bladder by [...] "gulping" [...] air. Excess gas can be removed in a similar manner.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} how morphological {{differences in}} the auditory periphery of teleost fishes may relate to hearing capabilities. Two species of western Atlantic sciaenids were examined: weakfish (Cynoscion regalis, Block and Schneider) and spot (Leiostomus xanthurus, Lacepede). These species differ in the anatomical relationship between <b>the</b> <b>swim</b> bladder and <b>the</b> inner ear. In weakfish, <b>the</b> <b>swim</b> bladder has a pair of anterior horns that terminate close to the ear, {{while there are no}} extensions of <b>the</b> <b>swim</b> bladder in spot. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>swim</b> bladder in spot terminates at a greater distance from the ear when compared to weakfish. With the use of the auditory brainstem response technique, Cynoscion regalis were found to detect frequencies up to 2000 Hz, while Leiostomus xanthurus detected up to 700 Hz. There were, however, no significant interspecific differences in auditory sensitivity for stimuli between 200 and 700 Hz. These data support the hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>swim</b> bladder can potentially expand the frequency range of detection...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{case report}} {{describes}} an experienced open-water ultra-endurance athlete swimming in water of 9. 9 °C for 6 h and 2 min. Methods Before <b>the</b> <b>swim,</b> anthropometric {{characteristics such as}} body mass, body height, skinfold thicknesses, and body fat were determined. During and after <b>the</b> <b>swim,</b> body core (rectum) and body surface (forearm and calf) temperatures were continuously recorded. Results The swimmer (53 years old, 110. 5 kg body mass, 1. 76 m body height, 34. 9 % body fat, and a body mass index of 35. 7 kg/m 2) achieved a total distance of 15 km while swimming at a mean speed of 2. 48 km/h, equal to 0. 69 m/s, in water of 9. 9 °C. Body core temperature was at 37. 8 °C before <b>the</b> <b>swim,</b> increased {{to a maximum of}} 38. 1 °C after approximately 20 min of swimming, and then decreased continuously to 36. 3 °C upon finishing <b>the</b> <b>swim.</b> <b>The</b> lowest body core temperature was 36. 0 °C between 35 and 60 min after finishing <b>the</b> <b>swim.</b> Sixty minutes after <b>the</b> <b>swim,</b> <b>the</b> body core temperature continuously rose to 36. 5 °C where it remained. At the forearm, the temperature dropped to 19. 6 °C after approximately 36 min of swimming and decreased to 19. 4 °C by the end of <b>the</b> <b>swim.</b> <b>The</b> lowest temperature at the forearm was 17. 6 °C measured at approximately 47 min before <b>the</b> athlete stopped <b>swimming.</b> At <b>the</b> calf, the temperature dropped to 13. 0 °C after approximately 24 min of swimming and decreased to 11. 9 °C at the end of <b>the</b> <b>swim.</b> <b>The</b> lowest temperature measured at the calf was 11. 1 °C approximately 108 min after the start. In both the forearm and the calf, the skin temperature continuously increased after <b>the</b> <b>swim.</b> Conclusions This case report shows that (1) it is possible to swim for 6 h in water of 9. 9 °C and that (2) the athlete did not suffer from hypothermia under these circumstances. The high body mass index, high body fat, previous experience, and specific preparation of the swimmer are the most probable explanations for these findings...|$|R
