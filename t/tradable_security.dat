40|$|There {{is little}} {{economic}} theory that supports designing compensation packages {{to include a}} market-traded component. Any contract based on <b>tradable</b> <b>securities</b> can potentially be replicated with non-tradable securities {{that would give the}} employer tighter control on the incentives and trading activities of the employee. Indeed, it seems paradoxical to compensate employees with <b>tradable</b> <b>securities</b> only to impose restrictions that prohibit them from taking advantage of the tradability feature. This thesis provides insights into the role and economic consequences of disclosures aimed at reducing the ability of employees to gain from insider trading. To analyze the impact of compensating employees with <b>tradable</b> <b>securities</b> I use a principal-agent framework where insider trading is captured by the notion of contract renegotiation. In the first analytical piece I show that in certain situations allowing the agent to trade anonymously on his private information increases production and, more importantly, is socially desirable compared to the case where the agent's trades are required to be publicly disclosed. The intuition for this result is that the bid-ask spread imposed by the market maker makes it costly for the agent to sell his shares and get full insurance if he shirks. The consequence of the positive incentive effects for the agent makes the overall economy better off. In the second version of my model I attempt to capture the SEC notion of insider trading where a manager has material non-public information prior to trading his equity claims. In this piece I allow the agent to collect private information prior to his trading. I identify three information structures and compare the production in the economy where the agent gathers private information prior to trading, to a scenario where private information acquisition is prohibited. I show that {{it is not at all}} clear-cut that private information collection by employees is always detrimental to the firm. Rather, situations may arise where private information collection and insider trading by employees results in higher production in the economy and can be socially desirable. Hence the thesis attempts to provide some potential economic reasons for employees to be compensated with <b>tradable</b> <b>securities...</b>|$|R

40|$|Between {{the start}} of the {{financial}} crisis {{in the third quarter of}} 2007 and the third quarter of 2008, Austrian household sector losses arising from investment in <b>tradable</b> <b>securities</b> amounted to approximately EUR 24 billion. This study uses micro and macro data to examine the possible consequences of this loss of wealth on the consumption behavior of households. Micro data for Austria indicate that owing to unequal distribution, it is primarily the wealthier households that have been directly affected by the crisis. However, all households may be impacted by the consequences of the financial crisis via confidence effects, irrespective of whether they hold securities or not. Estimates based on macro data show that the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth of Austrian households is 0. 05 and thus within the international average. Results of Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB) simulations using a macroeconometric model indicate that a decrease in wealth has a relatively minor effect on private consumption and economic growth in Austria. Moreover, this effect only occurs with a substantial lag. Due to the historic singularity of the current financial crisis, however, above all the indirect confidence effects could be more intense than estimated. wealth effects, financial wealth, marginal propensity to consume out of wealth, saving behavior, financial crisis...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} model in which {{financial}} intermediaries hold liquidity {{to protect themselves from}} shocks. Depending on parameter values, banks may choose to hold {{too much or too little}} liquidity on aggregate compared with the socially optimal amount. The model endogenously generates a situation of cash hoarding, leading to the associated market freezes or underinsurance against liquidity choice. The model therefore provides a unified framework for thinking, on the one hand, about policy measures that can reduce hoarding of cash by banks and, on the other hand, about liquidity requirements of the type imposed by the new Basel III regulation. In our model, banks hold tradable and nontradable assets. Nontradable assets are subject to a liquidity shock, and an injection of cash is required for the asset to mature if it is hit by the shock. Banks have access to an interbank market on which they obtain cash against their <b>tradable</b> <b>securities.</b> The quantity of cash obtained on this market is determined endogenously by the market value of the tradable assets and is subject to cash-in-the-market pricing.

40|$|As {{the stock}} market is {{volatile}} and often short-term, there is a high demand for safe investments outside {{the stock market}} and institutional investors like pension funds, insurance companies and asset managers are increasingly searching for low-risk investments that can deliver safe returns.   Alternative investments, like real estate, are a popular way to invest institutional capital. However, debates whether pension savers {{should have the right to}} transfer their pension capital without restrictions and discussions about the suitability of institutional investors to own real estate directly has made liquidity a more important aspect when investing institutional capital.   Forecasts and expectations suggest that a large part of Sweden’s public real estate portfolio, such as schools, hospitals and nursing homes, will be sold or produced privately as new builds in the future. Earlier studies have also shown that this type of real estate, with long leases and reliable tenants, is suitable for securitization, that is to say for issuing <b>tradable</b> <b>securities</b> such as bonds based on the cash flows from such assets.   The high demand for institutional capital to find safe and liquid investments and the large future divestment of public properties create opportunities for financial innovation.   This thesis aims to research if there are arbitrage opportunities to exploit due to differences between the real estate market and the capital market in the pricing of public real estate.

40|$|The main {{contribution}} of the Di Giovanni and Levchenko paper is the development and estimation of a mean- variance measure of riskiness for the export sectors. This measure is potentially useful {{for the analysis of}} the trade- off between sectoral specialization, according to comparative advantage, and sectoral output volatility. Research in the comparative advantage- risk trade- off goes back four decades ago. Brainard and Cooper (1968), Kemp and Liviatan (1973), and Turnovsky (1974), introduced technological uncertainty into the deterministic Ricardian and Heckscher- Ohlin models of international trade. They quickly found that some of the main propositions of comparative advantage break down in the presence of uncertainty. As it turned out, the absence of tradable means for international risk sharing is the reason. A risk- averse representative consumer diversifies the economy’s factor allocation across sectors instead of a portfolio of <b>tradable</b> <b>securities.</b> Trade in financial assets permits a separation of factor allocation across sectors, which is done by stock market maximizing firms (from risk- averse households) choosing the portfolio of risksharing assets. In my early research with Elhanan Helpman (Helpman and Razin 1978), this is indeed how we resolve the nonspecialization puzzle, and the apparent breakdown of major international trade theorems under uncertainty. But Di Giovanni and Levchenko (2011, in this volume) model the comparative advantage- risk trade- off by assuming the existence of international trade in goods, but no international trade in risk- sharing assets. They derive a U- shaped relationship between the export’s industry concentration and comparative advantage measures. The U- shaped relationship is the focus of their empirical analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} elderly people has been {{steadily}} rising in Sweden {{for a long time}} and as a proportion of the population, the increase has been even greater. The population structure in the country means that in the not too distant future, there will be a sharp rise in demand for care and elderly accommodation. A tighter credit market as a consequence of new rules and regulations with a stricter capital and liquidity requirements combined with market turbulence, has made financing property developement more difficult and more expensive which has resulted in many companies using alternative sources of finance. DEmand for safe investments with low risk is high as the market is volatile and banks, pension funds, fund management and life insurance companies are looking for investments outside the stock market that can deliver a safe return in the longer term. There has also been a debate about whether institutional investors as the AP pension funds really should own properties directly. As properties for care and elderly accommodation are definable assets with predictable payment flows, long leases and often a local authority as tenant that would not risk cancelling payments, these would be highly appropriate for securitisation, i. e. to issue bonds or other <b>tradable</b> <b>securities</b> based on the cash flows from the assets. In other words, the securitisation of rent flows would offer the opportunity to create an attractive investment product of the type being demanded, well suited to institutional investor requirements, while at the same time, it can provide an attractive financing opportunity to meet the need for more care and elderly accommodation...|$|R

Their contribution lies in providing time-series evidence on a hypothesis that is very popular - but had not been substantiated - among supporters of fully funded pension systems in which funds invest large shares of their portfolios in <b>tradable</b> <b>securities</b> (equities, bonds). The literature is not clear on its assumption regarding causality between contractual savings, and capital market development. A one-way or two-way relationship is assumed, usually inter-changeably; the authors address the questions of which leads empirically. They present the evidence, including descriptive statistics, and the results of Granger causality tests, for OECD countries, and such countries as Chile, Malaysia, Singapore, South Africa, and Thailand. They do not present a theoretical framework, but do explain how the growth of the contractual savings sector, is thought to promote financial development. The authors find evidence in the data that causality between institutions, and markets either does not exist, or, if it exists, runs predominantly from institutions to markets. To a lesser extent, there is simultaneous causality between institutions, and markets. Furthermore, there is limited evidence that causality runsonly from markets to institutions (the only exception seems to be for non-life insurance in developing countries). Results seem to support the idea that the development of institutional investors, is likely to promote the growth of market capitalization, more than that of value traded. In developing countries, {{there seems to be no}} causality from pension funds to growth in value traded, while there is causality from life, and non-life insurance.

Their contribution lies in providing cross-country, and time-series on a hypothesis that is very popular - but had not been substantiated - among supporters of funded pension systems, and insurance in which reserves are largely invested in <b>tradable</b> <b>securities</b> (equities and bonds). The authors presenta three-assets model (money, quasi money, and shares) to study the effects of the development of contractual savings (pension funds and life insurance companies) and non-life insurance companies on assets market equilibrium, and on stock market development. They use an unbalanced panel of 21 OECD, and 5 developing countries, and an error components two-stage least squares (EC 2 SLS) estimator, including a test for endogeneity of these institutional investors. The results support the hypothesis that contractual savings, and non-life insurance companies can be treated as exogenous to the development of stock markets; that contractual savings and non-life insurance companies, as well as their portfolio policies, promote stock market development as measured by stock market capitalization, and value traded as a share of GDP. The results show that stock market capitalization is positively correlated with the return on stocks, the assets of contractual savings and non-life insurance companies, the shares of stocks in the portfolios of contractual savings and non-life insurance companies, and the value traded stocks. Stock market capitalization is negatively correlated with the real interest rate, the real return on money (measured by the inverse of inflation), and stock market volatility. Stock market value traded is positively correlated with the shares of stocks in the portfolios of contractual savings and non-life insurance companies, and the real return on money. It is negatively correlated with the real interest rate. The authors conclude that insurance and contractual savings are powerful instruments for developing stock markets, providing depth and liquidity. Higher liquidity, in turn, further promotes market capitalization. Economic Theory&Research,Insurance&Risk Mitigation,Contractual Savings,Financial Intermediation,Banks&Banking Reform...|$|R
5000|$|The VOC {{played a}} crucial role in the rise of {{corporate}}-led globalization, corporate governance, corporate identity, corporate social responsibility, corporate finance, modern entrepreneurship, and financial capitalism. During its golden age, the company made some fundamental institutional innovations in economic and financial history. These financially revolutionary innovations allowed a single company (like the VOC) to mobilize financial resources from a large number of investors and create ventures at a scale that had previously only been possible for monarchs. In the words of Canadian historian and sinologist Timothy Brook, [...] "the Dutch East India Company—the VOC, as it is known—is to corporate capitalism what Benjamin Franklin's kite is to electronics: the beginning of something momentous that could not have been predicted at the time." [...] The birth of the VOC is often considered to be the official beginning of the corporate globalization era with the rise of modern corporations as a powerful socio-politico-economic system that significantly affect humans lives in every corner of the world today. As the world's first publicly traded company and first listed company (the first company to be ever listed on an official stock exchange), the VOC was the first company to issue stock and bonds to the general public. Considered by many experts to be the world's first truly (modern) multinational corporation, the VOC was also the first permanently organized limited-liability joint-stock company, with a permanent capital base. The VOC shareholders were the pioneers in laying the basis for modern corporate governance and corporate finance. The VOC is often considered as the precursor of modern corporations, if not the first truly modern corporation. It was the VOC that invented the idea of investing in the company rather than in a specific venture governed by the company. With its pioneering features such as corporate identity (first globally-recognized corporate logo), entrepreneurial spirit, legal personhood, transnational (multinational) operational structure, high and stable profitability, permanent capital (fixed capital stock), freely transferable shares and <b>tradable</b> <b>securities,</b> separation of ownership and management, and limited liability for both shareholders and managers, the VOC is generally considered a major institutional breakthrough and the model for the large-scale business enterprises that now dominate the global economy.|$|R
