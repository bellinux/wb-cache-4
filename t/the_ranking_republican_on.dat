5|$|In March, Congressman Darrell Issa, <b>the</b> <b>ranking</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent {{a letter}} to White House Counsel Robert Bauer stating if Sestak's claim was true, the Obama {{administration}} may have violated a federal statue that makes it illegal for a government employee to use his authority to interfere with a Senate election. Interest in the alleged job offer reignited after Sestak defeated Specter in the primary on May 18. Seven Republicans from the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder seeking a review of the legal implications of the offer. Around this time, Sestak continued to maintain that a job offer was made, but he downplayed the importance of the incident and defended Obama's integrity. On May 28, the White House formally responded to the allegations and acknowledged White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel enlisted former President Bill Clinton to offer Sestak a seat on a presidential advisory board or another executive board if Sestak dropped his candidacy. If Sestak accepted, he would have been allowed to remain in the House while serving in the unpaid position.|$|E

25|$|Though Hillary Clinton was {{ultimately}} confirmed on January 21 by a 95–2 vote, with David Vitter (R-Louisiana) and Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) in dissent, Senate Republicans slowed the process due to objections over the charitable activities of Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton. John Cornyn (R-Texas) held up proceedings {{for a day}} to discuss this matter. Richard Lugar (R-Indiana), <b>the</b> <b>ranking</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> the Foreign Relations Committee, {{expressed an interest in}} President Bill Clinton's foundation reject foreign contributions to avoid possible conflict of interest.

2500|$|There were Republican {{state legislators}} who {{supported}} other cuts of the bonding bill, including Doug Magnus, <b>the</b> <b>ranking</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> the House Transportation Finance Division, who praised Pawlenty's [...] "fiscal responsibility." [...] Critics, including Chris Coleman, Mayor of Saint Paul, called Pawlenty's veto [...] "political gamesmanship," [...] seeing the move as retribution for the Legislature's successful override of Pawlenty's veto of a transportation bonding bill. They noted cuts overwhelmingly targeted Democratic districts, and Democratic stronghold Saint Paul most heavily.|$|E

2500|$|Sessions {{also served}} as <b>the</b> <b>ranking</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> the Judiciary Committee during the {{nomination}} process for Elena Kagan, President Obama's nominee to succeed retired Justice John Paul Stevens. Sessions based his opposition on the nominee's lack of experience, her background as a political operative (Kagan had said that she worked in the Clinton White House not as a lawyer but as a policy adviser), and her record on guns, abortion, and gay rights. Sessions pointed out that Kagan [...] "has a very thin record legally, never tried a case, never argued before a jury, only had her first appearance in the appellate courts a year ago".|$|E

2500|$|Smith did {{not expect}} a {{challenge}} for the chair when Congress convened in 2005. However, Steve Buyer, <b>the</b> fourth <b>ranking</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> committee, asked {{for an interview with}} the Republican Steering Committee, and on January 5, 2005 it voted to make him chairman. That decision was ratified by the <b>Republican</b> Conference <b>on</b> January 6, and Smith was removed from the committee altogether. Smith stated at the time, [...] "I don't look at power as something to hold. I see the power of the gavel as a strategic opportunity to do good, to use it in every way to help veterans", he said in his speech to the Conference. New Jersey Republicans expressed dismay, and New Jersey Democrats and the leaders of just about every veterans group expressed outrage. Richard B. Fuller, the national legislative director for the Paralyzed Veterans of America, said, [...] "The Republicans needed a chairman who would consistently say no to veterans' groups and say yes to the Republican leadership. That meant get rid of Chris Smith." ...|$|R
2500|$|Through his {{testimony}} before Congress on {{issues ranging from}} the Patriot Act to U.S. Attorney firings, he commonly admitted ignorance. The response to Gonzales's testimony by those Senators serving on both the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees was one of disbelief. Russ Feingold, {{who is a member}} of both the Judiciary and Intelligence committees, said, [...] "I believe your testimony is misleading at best," [...] which Sheldon Whitehouse—also a member of both committees—concurred with, saying, [...] "I have exactly the same perception." [...] Chuck Schumer said Gonzales was [...] "not being straightforward" [...] with the committee. [...] Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said, [...] "I just don't trust you," [...] and urged Gonzales to carefully review {{his testimony}}. [...] <b>The</b> <b>ranking</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> the Judiciary Committee, Arlen Specter, said to Gonzales, [...] "Your credibility has been breached to the point of being actionable." [...] Leahy and Specter's comments were interpreted as warnings that Gonzales might have been perjuring himself. [...] After the meeting, Intelligence Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller said Gonzales was being [...] "untruthful." [...] Rockefeller's sentiments were echoed by Jane Harman, a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee, who accused Gonzales of [...] "selectively declassifying information to defend his own conduct." ...|$|E

2500|$|Political {{pressure}} from the Northeast to make the game more widely viewable preceded the decision to simulcast the game on CBS and NBC. Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania senator who was <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>ranking</b> member <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Senate Judiciary Committee, and Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Committee's head, wrote the league a letter threatening to reconsider the antitrust exemption currently enjoyed by the NFL under United States law.

5000|$|Senator Baucus, {{chairman}} of the Senate Finance Committee, received over $3 million from the health and insurance industries from 2003 to 2008, {{more than any other}} member of Congress. <b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Ranking</b> Member <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, received more than $2 million since 2003. Commentator Jack Cafferty and representatives from the Physicians for a National Health Program and Campaign Money Watch have argued that this lobbying creates a conflict of interest for the Senators. Baucus disputes the allegations, referring to a 2007 meeting reported on by The Wall Street Journal in which he told medical lobbyists [...] "you should worry about me coming after you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Obama {{reacted to}} the initial news saying {{that he would like}} to see a [...] "rigorous" [...] {{investigation}} and that [...] "if it turns out that some of the allegations that have been made in the press are confirmed, then of course I'll be angry. We are representing the people of the United States, and when we travel to another country, I expect us to observe the highest standards." [...] Obama later praised Secret Service agents as [...] "incredible"; on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, he said [...] "they protect me, they protect our girls. A couple of knuckleheads shouldn’t detract from what they do. What they were thinking, I don’t know. That's why they’re not there anymore." [...] Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said: [...] "We let the boss down because nobody's talking about what went on in Colombia other than this incident. I can speak for myself and my fellow chiefs, we're embarrassed by what occurred in Colombia." [...] He added that the head of the Southern Command General Douglas Fraser had started an investigation of the issue; he expressed his [...] "disappointment by the entire incident and that this behaviour is not in keeping with the professional standards expected of members of the United States military." [...] The chairman of the joint-chiefs-of-staff, General Martin Dempsey, also added that Obama had been let down as a result of this distraction. Senator Susan Collins, <b>the</b> highest <b>ranking</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee added: [...] "I am having a call this evening with the director of the Secret Service, because I find this to be so appalling. I can't help but think what if the women involved had been spies, what if they had been members of a drug cartel, what if they had planted equipment or eavesdropping devices?" [...] She also said that Sullivan had told her that [...] "the most important quality for a Secret Service officer is character. If the facts prove to be as reported on this, this is an incredible lack of character and breach of security, and potentially extremely serious." [...] White House spokesman Jay Carney added that [...] "Sullivan acted quickly in response to this incident, and he's overseeing an investigation as we speak. This incident needs to be investigated, and it is being investigated. We need to see what the investigation reveals. We’re not going to speculate about the conclusions it might reach." [...] On 25 April, United States Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano testified in a Senate hearing on the activities of the Homeland Security Department which oversees the Secret Service. Napolitano stated during her hearing that the Secret Service's Office of Professional Responsibility had received no complaints of misconduct similar to what happened in Cartagena over the past two-and-a-half years, expressed her confidence in Secret Service director Mark J. Sullivan, called the allegations against the implicated agents [...] "inexcusable" [...] and promised a thorough investigation by saying: [...] "We will leave no stone unturned." [...] Cartagena's residents were at first amused about the controversy, but the attitude later changed when it was perceived that the controversy cast a shadow on Colombia's image as a prosperous and peaceful country.|$|R
