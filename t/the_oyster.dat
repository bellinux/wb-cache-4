5|$|July 3, 1994- Tropical Storm Alberto makes {{landfall}} near Destin, dropping moderate rainfall {{across the}} state including over 20inches (500mm) along the Florida Panhandle. Heavy rainfall throughout the area results in extensive flooding, with the Apalachicola and Chipola Rivers exceeding a 100-year flood event. 300,000 chickens and 90% of <b>the</b> <b>oyster</b> crop in Apalachicola Bay perish. Damage in Florida totals $80million (1994USD, $116million 2008USD)).|$|E
5|$|The main {{industries}} on Mersea are farming, {{fishing and}} servicing the leisure boating and yachting industry. Oysters have been harvested {{off the island}} since Roman times, and are shipped worldwide.

5|$|All trips {{made with}} a SmarTrip card, with the {{exception}} of bus transfers and passes, are charged as individual one-way fares. WMATA offers discounted rail and bus passes to customers who make several trips in one day, or many trips, or many short trips, in a seven-day period or calendar month; however, SmarTrip users must manually load each transit pass onto their SmarTrip cards or sign up for an autoload of the pass in advance. This is in contrast to <b>the</b> <b>Oyster</b> card system on the London Underground, for example, where fares are automatically capped to ensure that customers never pay more than the cost of a one-day pass each day.|$|E
5|$|Both Neotrypaea californiensis and the {{mud shrimp}} Upogebia pugettensis live in mudflats and sandy {{substrates}} in the intertidal zone of estuaries in western North America. N.californiensis is found from Mutiny Bay, Alaska to Punta Abreojos, Mulegé, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Its habitat {{is also used}} for the aquaculture of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. Since the bioturbation carried out by N.californiensis and U. pugettensis reduces the productivity of <b>the</b> <b>oyster</b> beds, they are considered pests. Their effects may, however, have knock-on effects across the entire ecosystem, and may buffer it from the hazards of nutrient enrichment and increase primary and secondary productivity by {{increasing the amount of}} dissolved inorganic nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|The crime gained {{national}} notoriety for the particularly brutal way {{in which}} Pryce was murdered, only metres from his own home, and had only his Oyster card and mobile phone taken from him, but no money (the case being widely reported {{as an example of}} steaming). The murderers were later tracked down when the police examined CCTV footage of where <b>the</b> <b>Oyster</b> card was used after the murder. The crime caused a political uproar and condemnation of railway station security. The Tom ap Rhys Pryce Memorial Trust was set up after the murder, and a school was built in his honour.|$|E

5|$|When Kate {{struck the}} Florida Panhandle, {{it became the}} first {{hurricane}} to make landfall in that location since Hurricane Eloise in 1975. Storm surge and flooding rains destroyed much of <b>the</b> <b>oyster</b> industry, causing many people {{to lose their jobs}} in the weeks after the storm. Gusts over 100mph (160km/h) contributed to downed trees and building damage, while the combination of wind and rain led to downed power poles. Across the remainder of the southeast United States, several inches of rainfall led to flash flooding, damage to roadways, and major tree damage. Overall, Kate resulted in 15fatalities and $700million in damage.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, the island {{became part of the}} front line for invasion and was heavily fortified. Along with other coastal resorts, the island drew in evacuees from London, though as the war progressed, these were moved to safer settlements further inland. 2000 troops were stationed on the island to guard against invasion. A battery of 4.7 inch guns was installed along the beach along with a Battery Observation post and a number of searchlights and pillboxes. Several of these installations survived and can still be seen along the south coast of the island, one of which has been converted into a cafe. After the war, the island suffered from severe winter weather in 1947 which destroyed much of <b>the</b> <b>oyster</b> fishery, and from the flooding of 1953, where numerous beach huts were swept out to sea.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, Mersea Fort was in ruins. The fishery {{rules were}} {{reinforced}} by fresh legislation in 1758, which created {{a court of}} conservancy to oversea <b>the</b> <b>oyster</b> stocks. Officially, this court was supposed {{to sit at the}} fort, but rather than using the now dilapidated earthworks, it began to meet in Colchester's Moot Hall. Instead, a ceremony began to take place each year at the Mersea Stone, near to the fort, involving local dignitaries and extensive eating and drinking. The fort was recommissioned during the Napoleonic Wars {{at the start of the}} 19th century, and a new gun battery was constructed overlooking the sea, equipped with six 24-pounder (10.9kg) guns. After this the fort was abandoned once again. A sea wall was built along the coast early in the century, cutting through the south-east side of the fort. The legislation on oysters was reformed by Parliament in 1870, which disbanded the previous court structure and severed the historic link with Mersea Fort. A defensive pill-box was constructed at the castle during the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|In 1552 {{the fort}} was decommissioned, but was {{subsequently}} recommissioned by Mary I. In {{addition to the}} fort's military role, it hosted a court to oversee the oysterfields along the East Mersea coast, which were particularly lucrative but at risk of overfishing. In 1566, Colchester introduced new rules to govern <b>the</b> <b>oyster</b> trade, which were enforced by an admiralty court, held when necessary in Mersea Fort; the location was chosen so as to demonstrate the town's authority {{all the way up}} to the top of the estuary. A survey in 1586 showed the fort had been abandoned by the military once again: the defences were in a poor state, the guns' barrels were clogged with dirt and the site had been occupied by an elderly woman. It was brought back into use in 1588 and 1631 to defend against first the Spanish Armada and then the Dunkirker privateers.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 in the United States, {{a serious}} {{outbreak}} of oyster-vectored disease {{was caused by}} Vibrio vulnificus. Although the number of victims was low, the mortality rate was high at 50%. About 10 cases have occurred annually since then and further {{research needs to be}} done to establish the epidemiology of the infections. The cases peak in mid-summer and autumn with no cases being reported in mid winter so there may be a link between the temperature at which the oysters are held between harvesting and consumption. In 1978, an oyster-associated gastrointestinal infection affecting more than 2,000 people occurred in Australia. The causative agent was found to be the Norwalk virus and the epidemic caused major economic difficulties to <b>the</b> <b>oyster</b> farming industry in the country. In 1988, an outbreak of hepatitis A associated with the consumption of inadequately cooked clams (Anadara subcrenata) took place in the Shanghai area of China. An estimated 290,000 people were infected and there were 47 deaths.|$|E
5|$|In the English Civil War, the Parliamentary Army built a {{blockhouse}} at East Mersea in 1648, {{with the}} aim of blockading the River Colne during the Siege of Colchester. Some ruins of this blockhouse remain and are known as the Block House Stone, which is legally protected by English Heritage as a scheduled monument. Fishing grew in importance on the island during this time, with numerous fish weirs being installed. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Dutch and French settlers arrived on the island. Some locals supplemented their income from <b>the</b> <b>oyster</b> trade by smuggling, which remained popular until the mid-19th century. Smugglers favoured the Peldon Rose, immediately north of the Strood, where they would store contraband in the pond alongside the inn. In the early 19th century, the increased demand for oysters despite a limited supply from the Strood and Pyefleet Channel led traders to get oysters from other places and pass them off as native to the island.|$|E

5|$|As {{proposed}} in their election manifesto, in February 2003 Livingstone's administration introduced a congestion charge covering 8 square miles in central London, charging motorists £5 {{a day for}} driving through the area. It was introduced {{in an attempt to}} deter traffic and reduce congestion; Livingstone himself took the London Underground to work, and tried to inspire more Londoners to use public transport rather than cars. The policy was highly controversial, and strongly opposed by businesses, resident groups, the roads lobby, and the Labour government; many commentators recognised that if opposition resulted in the policy being abandoned then it could lead to the end of Livingstone's political career. That year, the Political Studies Association named Livingstone 'Politician of the Year' due to his implementation of the 'bold and imaginative' scheme. The scheme resulted in a marked reduction on traffic in central London, resulting in improved bus services, and by 2007, TfL could claim that the charge had reduced congestion by 20%. To further encourage the use of public transport, in June 2003, <b>the</b> <b>Oyster</b> card system was introduced, while bus and Underground journeys were made free for people aged 11 to 18.|$|E
5|$|Many species produce {{metabolites}} {{that are}} {{major sources of}} pharmacologically active drugs. Particularly important are the antibiotics, including the penicillins, a structurally related group of β-lactam antibiotics that are synthesized from small peptides. Although naturally occurring penicillins such as penicillin G (produced by Penicillium chrysogenum) have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, {{a wide range of}} other penicillins can be produced by chemical modification of the natural penicillins. Modern penicillins are semisynthetic compounds, obtained initially from fermentation cultures, but then structurally altered for specific desirable properties. Other antibiotics produced by fungi include: ciclosporin, commonly used as an immunosuppressant during transplant surgery; and fusidic acid, used to help control infection from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, and others began in the early 20th century and continues to date. In nature, antibiotics of fungal or bacterial origin appear to play a dual role: at high concentrations they act as chemical defense against competition with other microorganisms in species-rich environments, such as the rhizosphere, and at low concentrations as quorum-sensing molecules for intra- or interspecies signaling. Other drugs produced by fungi include griseofulvin isolated from Penicillium griseofulvum, used to treat fungal infections, and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Examples of statins found in fungi include mevastatin from Penicillium citrinum and lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus and <b>the</b> <b>oyster</b> mushroom.|$|E
