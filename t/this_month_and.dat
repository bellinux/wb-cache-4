25|$|The date {{of their}} arrival, October 1, 1608, is a {{commemorative}} holiday for Polish-Americans. Polish American Heritage Month {{is based on}} <b>this</b> <b>month,</b> <b>and</b> October 1 is commemorated annually in Polonia organizations. 2008 was considered the 400-year anniversary of Polish settlement in the United States, and 2019 is looked upon as the 400th celebration of the Jamestown strike, considered a fight for civil liberties, more specifically, their voting rights, and equal recognition regardless of ethnicity.|$|E
500|$|In September 1940 29 Squadron {{began to}} convert to the Bristol Beaufighter, a rugged and heavily armed {{twin-engine}} aircraft equipped with airborne interception radar {{in the shape of}} AI Mk. IV radar sets, just as the Luftwaffe began its campaign against British industrial cities—known as [...] "The Blitz". By 29 November Squadron had become an all-Beaufighter unit. Braham {{was among the first to}} fly the Beaufighter and did so in September. He would, however, spend nearly the entire month hospitalised after a serious car accident. He flew his first wartime operation in a Beaufighter on 17 November 1940. Squadron Leader Guy Gibson led the mission. Braham flew nine operations in <b>this</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> enhanced his skills by completing a blind-flying course which taught pilots to fly in low-visibility conditions. For his service he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 17 January 1941.|$|E
500|$|In 1954, Charles Patterson {{defended the}} poem and claimed, [...] "The meaningfulness {{and range of}} the poem, along with its {{controlled}} execution and powerfully suggestive imagery, entitle it to a high place among Keats's great odes. It lacks the even finish and extreme perfection of To Autumn but is much superior in these qualities to the Ode to a Nightingale despite the magic passages in the latter and the similarities of over-all structure. In fact, the Ode on a Grecian Urn may deserve to rank first in the group if viewed in something approaching its true complexity and human wisdom." [...] Walter Jackson Bate argued in 1962 that [...] "the Grecian Urn possesses a quiet and constrained composure hardly equaled by the other odes of <b>this</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> perhaps even unsurpassed by the ode To Autumn of the following September... there is a severe repose about the Ode on a Grecian Urn; it is both 'interwoven' and 'complete'; and within its tensely braced stanzas is a potential energy momentarily stilled and imprisoned." [...] In 1964, literary critic David Perkins claimed in his essay [...] "The Ode on a Nightingale" [...] that {{the symbol of the}} urn [...] "may possibly not satisfy as the principal concern of poetry... but is rather an element in the poetry and drama of human reactions".|$|E

2500|$|There is nice {{story behind}} the name [...] "Purushottama Maasa". Each of the 12 months in the Hindu {{calendar}} was assigned to 12 different gods. But the 13th extra month was not assigned to any god. Adhik Maas felt sad and approached Lord Vishnu and said that no god was assigned to him (Adhik Maas) {{and for that reason}} he was called Mal Maas (Unclean Month). Adhik Maas further prayed to Lord Vishnu: 'I am filled with anxiety and I have therefore come to seek your refuge and help.. Lord Vishnu listened to him and gave his name to <b>this</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> communicated that this is the special or best month.|$|E
2500|$|As per tradition, November saw {{the entry}} into the FA Cup of the League One and Two teams. [...] The first two rounds were played during <b>this</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> Torquay found {{themselves}} involved in both after first easing past Conference side Mansfield Town and then seeing off Walsall of League One. [...] The two 1-0 victories ensured the Gulls participation in the Third Round {{for the fifth time}} in six seasons. [...] The Third Round draw saw Torquay receive a home fixture against another League One side Carlisle United. [...] While possibly not the money-spinning draw that either team was hoping for, it was at least a game which, on recent form, gave the Gulls a very realistic chance of progressing to the FA Cup Fourth Round.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 March, however, Regenvanu was reshuffled to the Ministry of Justice and Social Affairs. Prime Minister Kilman {{had just}} sacked Justice Minister Yoan Simon, who had [...] "reportedly backed the opposition’s {{plans for a}} motion of no confidence" [...] in him, and needed to shore up his {{coalition}} government by bringing in a new party. Kilman offered a Cabinet position to the Republican Party, who demanded the Lands Ministry. Consequently, Alfred Carlot replaced Regenvanu as Minister for Lands, while Regenvanu {{was appointed to the}} vacant position of Minister for Justice. Ben Bohane, of the Pacific Institute of Public Policy, remarked that Regenvanu seemed to have been [...] "sacrificed to allow the [...] to come in as a coalition partner for the government. The government's numbers are very shaky. Parliament is set to resume some time at the end of <b>this</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> again there is ongoing talk of a vote of no confidence." [...] Radio New Zealand International, describing Regenvanu as a reformer during his three weeks as Minister for Lands, noted: [...] "Reliable sources from the office of the opposition say Mr Kilman {{had no choice but to}} make the reshuffle to stay in power." [...] Radio Australia noted that he had been [...] "transferred due to political pressure", as the government tried to maintain a viable parliamentary majority. It added that Regenvanu was [...] "not happy about leaving before finishing significant changes to the laws on land ownership". Carlot said he would continue Regenvanu's reforms aimed at rooting out and prevent corrupt practices.|$|E
