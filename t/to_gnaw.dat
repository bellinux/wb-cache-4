5|$|Most rodents {{are small}} animals with robust bodies, short limbs, and long tails. They use their sharp incisors <b>to</b> <b>gnaw</b> food, {{excavate}} burrows, and defend themselves. Most eat seeds or other plant material, but some have more varied diets. They {{tend to be}} social animals and many species live in societies with complex ways of communicating with each other. Mating among rodents can vary from monogamy, to polygyny, to promiscuity. Many have litters of underdeveloped, altricial young, while others are precocial (relatively well developed) at birth.|$|E
5|$|When {{you were}} hungry, {{you began to}} cry, because you could not speak. You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, you began <b>to</b> <b>gnaw</b> a crust of bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E

He said:I watched young dogs when I was young. They were given bones <b>to</b> <b>gnaw</b> to strengthen their teeth. Those of you whose teeth have fallen out did not chew on bones. This is my advice...|$|E

50|$|China farms about 10,000 Asiatic {{black bears}} for bile production—an {{industry}} worth roughly $1.6 billion per year. The bears are permanently kept in cages, and bile is extracted from cuts in their stomachs. In Jan. 2013, Animals Asia Foundation rescued six bile bears, which had broken and rotted teeth due <b>to</b> <b>gnawing</b> at their cages.|$|R
25|$|As rodents, mice must gnaw to {{keep their}} incisors from growing too long. Overgrown teeth can cause {{occlusion}} (blockage) of the mouth, which in extreme cases can lead to starvation. Hard foodstuffs, small pieces of wood or specially prepared blocks can suit this purpose, although some mice can grind their teeth together ("bruxing") to keep them short. In rare cases a mouse {{may not be able}} <b>to</b> <b>gnaw</b> effectively, either from malformed incisors or jaws, and so its teeth must be trimmed by a veterinarian.|$|E
500|$|According to Rudolf Simek, [...] "the {{squirrel}} {{probably only}} represents an embellishing detail to the mythological {{picture of the}} world-ash in Grímnismál. Hilda Ellis Davidson, describing the world tree, states the squirrel is said <b>to</b> <b>gnaw</b> at it—furthering a continual destruction and re-growth cycle, and posits the tree symbolizes ever-changing existence. John Lindow points out that Yggdrasil is described as rotting {{on one side and}} as being chewed on by four harts and Níðhöggr, and that, according to the account in Gylfaginning, it also bears verbal hostility in the fauna it supports. Lindow adds that [...] "in the sagas, a person who helps stir up or keep feuds alive by ferrying words of malice between the participants is seldom one of high status, which may explain the assignment of this role in the mythology to a relatively insignificant animal".|$|E
500|$|Mileena is {{physically}} identical to Kitana, the most glaring exception being her half-Tarkata face with large and exposed fang-like teeth (which got noticeably downsized for Deception and Armageddon). Boon described Mileena as [...] "Anti-Kitana" [...] {{and said that}} her large [...] "sharp, nasty teeth" [...] have been not originally planned and were only drawn for her infamous Fatality [...] "Man-Eater" [...] (featured in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, too), in which she sucks up the entire body of her victims and then regurgitates their clean bones. After Mortal Kombat II, her teeth were almost never used again during gameplay until Mortal Kombat 2011 (in a leap attack to bite an opponent in the neck and in one Fatality <b>to</b> <b>gnaw</b> on the killed enemy's severed head), with a sole exception of one Fatality in Deception in which she uses them to tear off the opponent's head. Mileena's skin color appears to be at times mildly darker than Kitana's, but is always lighter than Jade's. After the two were given more varying appearances in Mortal Kombat Gold (hairstyle for Kitana-derived characters is loose in Mortal Kombat II and pinned back in Ultimate MK3), Mileena's hair is usually much shorter than Kitana's and is most often worn gathered in a ponytail. One element of Mileena's anatomy that has often changed is her eyes. As her supposed twin sister, Mileena shared Kitana's eyes in Mortal Kombat II; her eyes then became [...] "undead" [...] style all-white (similar to the eyes of Scorpion and Noob Saibot) in Ultimate MK3. In Deception, Armageddon and Shaolin Monks, Mileena's eyes return to normal, but with yellow pupils (Kitana's eyes are brown). In Mortal Kombat 2011, however, she has Baraka-like yellow eyes with slit pupils (her eyes are also sometimes seen as glowing whole), except of her alternate Ultimate MK3 style costume (available through pre-order bonuses and later in a DLC package) in which she has human eyes once again. In Mortal Kombat X, her facial appearance has undergone drastic changes on her facial appearance based on those from Mortal Kombat Legacy live-action series, such as having a human-like mouth, yet still retain most of her Tarkatan mouth, as seen on both of her cheeks.|$|E

40|$|General Motors and the A C. Rochester Company, a {{subsidiary}} of General Motors (GM), {{has found that the}} robber diaphragms on automatic speed control mechanisms (servos) were gnawed by unknown rodents. House mice (Mus musculus), Peromyscus spp., and eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) were used <b>to</b> test <b>gnawing</b> behavior on 4 kinds of diaphragms. Diaphragms with or without a rodent proof cure formula, which are used by GM, did not influence the gnawing of all test rodent species. Diaphragms with a lubricant (Paricin) were more attractive <b>to</b> <b>gnawing</b> by house mice than diaphragms without a lubricant. Five objects with different texture were used <b>to</b> detect <b>gnawing</b> preference of house mice and 3 objects were used on Peromyscus. The textures of diaphragms and nylon discs were not significantly preferred by house mice compared to the textures of corks and wood blocks. Rubber stoppers were gnawed less than wood blocks and corks by house mice and Peromyscus, but the differences were not significant. Results indicate that the presence of a rigid and protective edge on the diaphragms was a critical factor in attracting rodent <b>gnawing.</b> <b>To</b> test this possibility, diaphragms on servos supported by aluminum piston heads with 3 different beveled edges were presented to captive Peromyscus. The amount of gnawing was not significantly different among the diaphragms supported by the different piston heads. Once the gnawing was initiated, continued <b>gnawing</b> was thought <b>to</b> be dependent on the texture of objects...|$|R
50|$|Olympic marmots eat meadow flora such as {{avalanche}} and glacier lilies, heather blossoms, subalpine lupine, mountain buckwheat, harebells, sedges, and mosses. They prefer green, tender, {{flowering plants}} over {{other sources of}} food, but roots are {{a large part of}} their diets in the early spring when other plants have not yet appeared. During May and June, they may resort <b>to</b> <b>gnawing</b> on trees for food. They also occasionally eat fruits and insects. Their water requirements are met from the juice in the vegetation they eat and dew on the plants' surfaces.|$|R
2500|$|A common {{misunderstanding}} when {{purchasing a}} home for pet gerbils is they can live in housing designed for hamsters and mice. This is not correct, as {{they need to be}} able to dig tunnel systems, rather than have them created for them. The commonly plastic structure of hamster and mouse cages is inappropriate for gerbils due to their ability <b>to</b> <b>gnaw</b> through it very quickly. Plastic can cause serious health issues for the animal if ingested, therefore many owners refrain from having any plastic in the tank and rely entirely on wooden toys. Information from gerbil societies from throughout the globe is conflicting with regards to tank sizing. However, a common minimum given appears to be [...] per gerbil.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 April 1819, Brawne and her widowed mother {{moved into}} {{the other half of}} Dilke's Wentworth Place, and Keats and Brawne were able to see each other every day. Keats began to lend Brawne books, such as Dante's Inferno, and they would read together. He gave her the love sonnet [...] "Bright Star" [...] (perhaps revised for her) as a declaration. It was a work in {{progress}} which he continued at until the last months of his life, and the poem came to be associated with their relationship. [...] "All his desires were concentrated on Fanny". From this point there is no further documented mention of Isabella Jones. Sometime before the end of June, he arrived at some sort of understanding with Brawne, far from a formal engagement as he still had too little to offer, with no prospects and financial stricture. Keats endured great conflict knowing his expectations as a struggling poet in increasingly hard straits would preclude marriage to Brawne. Their love remained unconsummated; jealousy for his 'star' began <b>to</b> <b>gnaw</b> at him. Darkness, disease and depression surrounded him, reflected in poems such as [...] "The Eve of St. Agnes" [...] and [...] "La Belle Dame sans Merci" [...] where love and death both stalk. [...] "I have two luxuries to brood over in my walks;" [...] he wrote to her, [...] "...your loveliness, and the hour of my death".|$|E

50|$|Chicken wire, or poultry netting, is a mesh of wire {{commonly}} used to fence poultry livestock, such as chickens, in a run or coop. It is made of thin, flexible galvanized steel wire, with hexagonal gaps. Available in 1 inch (about 2.5 cm) diameter, 2 inch (about 5 cm) and 1/2 inch (about 1.3 cm), chicken wire is available in various wire gauges usually 19 gauge (about 1 mm wire) to 22 gauge (about 0.7 mm wire). Chicken wire is occasionally used to build inexpensive cages for small animals (or to protect plants and property from animals) though the thinness and zinc content of galvanized wire may be inappropriate for animals prone <b>to</b> <b>gnawing</b> and will not keep out predators.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} castorids {{belong to}} the genus Agnotocastor, known from the late Eocene and Oligocene of North America and Asia. Other early castorids included genera such as Steneofiber, from the Oligocene and Miocene of Europe, the earliest member of the subfamily Castorinae, which contains castorids closely related to living beavers. Their teeth were not well suited <b>to</b> <b>gnawing</b> wood, suggesting this habit evolved at a later point, but they do appear adapted to semiaquatic living. Later, such early species evolved into forms such as Palaeocastor from the Miocene of Nebraska. Palaeocastor was {{about the size of}} a muskrat, and dug corkscrew-shaped burrows up to 2.5 m deep. Giant forms evolved in the Pleistocene, including Trogontherium in Europe, and Castoroides in North America. The latter animal was as large as a black bear, yet had a brain only marginally larger than that of modern beavers. Its shape suggests it would have been a good swimmer, and it probably lived in swampy habitats.|$|R
