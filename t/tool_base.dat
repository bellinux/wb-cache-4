50|$|Scrapers are {{typically}} formed by chipping {{the end of}} a flake of stone in order to create one sharp side and to keep the rest of the sides dull to facilitate grasping it. Most scrapers are either circle or blade-like in shape. The working edges of scrapers tend to be convex, and many have trimmed and dulled lateral edges to facilitate hafting. One important variety of scraper is the thumbnail scraper, a scraper shaped much like its namesake. This scraper type is common at Paleo-Indian sites in North America. Scrapers {{are one of the most}} varied lithic tools found at archaeological sites. Due to the vast array of scrapers there are many typologies that scrapers can fall under, including tool size, tool shape, <b>tool</b> <b>base,</b> the number of working edges, edge angle, edge shape, and many more.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Coating is an {{effective}} method to solve the contradiction between the wear resistance and the toughness for tool materials and the coated tool can yield satisfied cutting performances. Now the coated high-speed steel (HSS) drill is widely used in drilling of stainless steel. This paper studied the tool life of the TiN, the TiAlN and the TiCN coated special drills in drilling austenitic stainless steel 1 Cr 18 Ni 9 Ti through contrastive experiments. The tool life of the TiN coated drill was only 81. 5 % of TiCN, and 66 % of TiAlN because of its low oxidization resistance and hardness. The wearing features of TiAlN and TiCN coating were also studied by experiments and the different wear mechanisms were revealed. Finally the comparison of cutting performance was given between TiAlN and TiCN coated drills and recommendation of coating selection for drilling austenitic stainless steel was also presented. TiCN coating is suitable for HSS cutting <b>tool</b> <b>base,</b> which is often used for drilling austenitic stainless steel at low speed. TiAlN coating is appropriate for tungsten carbide cutting <b>tool</b> <b>base,</b> which is used for drilling austenitic stainless steel at high speed. The special designed drill with optimal geometrical structure plus appropriate coating can yield long tool life and high material removal rate in high-efficient drilling austenitic stainless steel...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of studying the structural parameters and mechanical properties of multi-element coatings based on-TiZrN, TiZrAlN, TiZrCrN, and TiNbAlN. The phase composition, the structural parameters, and the mechanical properties of such coatings are shown to depend on the design of cathode evaporators and the machine layout at the moment of application. Compared to TiN coating, multi-element coatings have higher residual compressive stress, smaller CSR, higher microdeformations of the crystal lattice, better mechanical properties, yet weaker adhesion to the <b>tool</b> <b>base.</b> Based on studying their structural parameters and mechanical properties, we have designed double-layer coatings.

Highly developed countries, {{on the other}} hand, rapidly advance in developing affordable, numerically controlled and robotically supported material- and energy-efficient methods for building on demand.

40|$|For {{measuring}} software quality, {{majority of}} approaches focus on metric calculation based on code, which comes very {{late in the}} software development life cycle. The proposed approach presents a forward as well as reverse engineering approach that will detect software design patterns in UML model for forward engineering and from Java source code {{as a part of}} reverse engineering. Our approach uses structural, behavioral and semantic analysis. We introduce behavioral and semantic analysis that removes false positives from our structural analysis results. We are interested in assessing the quality of the software design by checking whether it conforms to design pattern and calculating package software metrics. Based on these two parameters the quality of the software system can be analyzed. We provide a tool that implements our approach.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the process {{integration}} project of the National Center for Photovoltaics (NCPV) is to develop an infrastructure that will allow researchers to gain new knowledge that is difficult [...] if not impossible [...] to obtain with existing equipment. This difficulty is due, in part, {{to the state of}} our existing tool set, which lacks sufficient in-situ or real-time measurement capabilities, or lacks access to analytical tools where the sample remains in a controlled environment between deposition and processing or measurement. This new infrastructure will provide flexible and robust integration of deposition, processing (etching, annealing, etc.), and characterization tools via a standardized transfer interface such that samples move between tools in a controlled ambient. This concept will also require the cooperation of experts from various material technologies and characterization disciplines to work directly with each other to obtain answers to key scientific and technological questions.

40|$|Abstract: End users {{activities}} {{in social media}} lead to regular changes in the overall privacy impact because they continually encounter or meddle in all forms of private data associations. Users are exposed to regular changes in risk level {{as a result of}} regular updates. To keep an overview over risk exposure, privacy risk assessments, in theory, should be re-done upon every update in a user’s network. End users could reduce their risk assessment burden if they could rely on an appropriate risk assessment tool providing information on risk levels as a result of changes in associations. We have several information technology (IT) security risk assessment tools available for such purpose. However, we cannot rely on such tools for legal privacy risk assessment because of their classic security focus. The security-focused risk assessment tools are based on the knowledge of security experts, and have strong focus on tangible assets and system security. Using such security risk assessment tools to assess legal privacy risk may impair communication and understanding, and may increase uncertainty in the risk estimation because such tools lack the domain knowledge. A risk assessment <b>tool</b> <b>base</b> on the legal privacy principles can reduce uncertainty in the risk estimation and enhance the risk assessment communication.
