5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Peasant</b> Wedding (1567) and <b>The</b> <b>Peasant</b> Dance (1569) {{are also}} by Bruegel which {{share the same}} wedding theme and {{elements}} and were painted {{in the same period}} in Bruegel's later years. They are considered to be a trilogy of works by Bruegel. In all three of the paintings, there are pipers playing the pijpzak (bagpipes), they also exude pride and vanity, for example in <b>The</b> <b>Peasant</b> Dance the man seated next to the pijpzak player is wearing a peacock feather in his hat.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} view remained ambivalent at best, though. A scene {{devoted to}} <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> war of 1653 in a theatre production for the Swiss sexacentennial celebrations in 1891, for instance, was {{cut on the}} demands of the organizers. The first statues to honor the peasants of 1653 and their leaders were erected in 1903 {{on the occasion of the}} 250th anniversary of <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> war. A monument honoring Schybi and Emmenegger was unveiled at Escholzmatt on July 26, 1903, at Rüderswil, a statue in honor of Leuenberger was erected the same year, and at Liestal an obelisk honoring <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> victims of the war was inaugurated on September 25, 1904. More statues and plaques were installed in various other places at the tricentennial of the war in 1953, for instance a relief showing Schybi in a chapel at Sursee, where <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> leader had been incarcerated.|$|E
5|$|Although Lenin was {{influenced}} by agrarian-socialist Pëtr Tkachëvi, he and the Social-Democrats clashed with the Socialist–Revolutionary Party (SR), who were inspired by the defunct People's Freedom Party. Advocating a Narodnik agrarian-socialist platform, the SR emphasised the revolutionary role of <b>the</b> <b>peasant,</b> who in 1881 numbered 75 million, {{in contrast to the}} 1 million urban proletariat in Russia. In contrast, the Marxists believed that <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> class' primary motivation was to own their land, and that they were capitalists; instead, they saw the proletariat as the revolutionary force to advance socialism.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>peasants</b> {{arrive at}} Tahy's castle armed. Tahy {{considers}} it no danger, and sends his servants to whip them away. At first, <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> {{seem to be}} frightened back, but then Petar kills of the men, prompting <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> to assault <b>the</b> walls. Tahy's servants refuse to help him, and he goes into hiding. After much loss, <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> break through <b>the</b> defences, storming the castle. The nobles are discovered, and a peasant girl slays Tahy's son. <b>The</b> <b>peasants</b> enjoy <b>the</b> wealth and luxury found within, which is distributed among them. With no military presence to stop them, <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> expand their influence. They release a proclamation, banning the nobility, {{the influence of the}} Roman Catholic Church, and declaring independence.|$|R
50|$|After another escape {{with the}} gold, the princess and Rokurōta, and <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> go {{separate}} ways. <b>The</b> <b>peasants</b> stumble upon <b>the</b> gold, but are then arrested by Akizuki clansmen. The clansmen take <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> to see <b>the</b> general, whereupon Rokurōta explains Yuki's true identity, and states {{that all of}} the gold has been used to restore her family's domain. <b>The</b> <b>peasants</b> are then dispatched, taking a single ryō. Finally, Tahei gives this to Matashichi to protect; but Matashichi allows Tahei to keep it.|$|R
5000|$|No deals played a.k.a. spring. If <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> do {{not deal}} any card in a round, or the {{landlord}} only deal the card once with cards left in {{hand in a}} round, the final score will be double. In the former situation, the landlord wins score while <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> lose, else <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> win score.|$|R
5|$|In the 19th century, the {{official}} view was increasingly questioned. The aristocratic Ancien Régime had been weakened severely during the Napoleonic Wars, when the Confederacy {{had been a}} French satellite state. The episode of the Helvetic Republic, short-lived as it had been, had instilled democratic ideals in the population. The restauration of the Ancien Régime {{after the end of}} the Napoleonic era proved to be only temporary, until Switzerland became a federal state in 1848 when its first democratic constitution was passed. During the restoration, democratic publishers instrumented and interpreted the history of <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> war as an allegory on the then current struggle for democracy, seeing <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> war of 1653 as an early precursor of their own efforts to overcome the authoritarian regime. Well-known examples are the illustrations by Martin Disteli from 1839/40, who used scenes from <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> war in such allegoric ways.|$|E
5|$|The Ottomans {{were able}} to build on their {{military}} success due to the numerous divisions amongst their opponents. Many of <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> classes in Anatolia saw the Ottomans as the better master.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Peasant</b> Popular Union and Social Democrats {{formed a}} left-wing {{coalition}} {{in opposition to}} the Christian Democrats. But the coalition still did not constitute a majority, and it went on to add representatives of minorities in Lithuania – Germans from the Klaipėda Region, Poles, and Jews. On 7 June, Kazys Grinius was elected the 3rd president of Lithuania and Mykolas Sleževičius became the prime minister. Both were members of <b>the</b> <b>Peasant</b> Popular Union.|$|E
50|$|Although both armies were, numerically, {{roughly the}} same size, <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> were {{defeated}} primarily for two reasons: first, although <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> were not poorly armed, because they not only had pitchforks, scythes and flails, but also pikes, guns and cannons, they were still powerless against the cavalry since they themselves had no cavalry - a decisive disadvantage. Second, <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> {{did not have a}} military leader who could have coordinated the troops and their direction, objectives and firepower. There were ringleaders amongst <b>the</b> <b>peasants,</b> but they had no influence beyond the boundaries of their home area. At that time, <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> did not recognize that they would have no chance of success against the Prince without a united approach.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Peasants</b> (Chłopi) is a Polish {{historical}} film {{directed by}} Jan Rybkowski. It {{was released in}} 1973. It is based on <b>the</b> novel <b>The</b> <b>Peasants</b> by Władysław Reymont.|$|R
50|$|The {{visions of}} the prophets {{inspired}} {{the operations of the}} war, and encouraged <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> to feel invincible. <b>The</b> <b>peasants</b> marched singing Psalms — which unnerved the opposition.|$|R
5|$|The Wedding Dance (sometimes {{known as}} The Dance Village) is a 1566 oil-on-panel {{painting}} by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Owned {{by the museum}} of the Detroit Institute of Arts in Detroit, Michigan, the work was discovered by its director in England in 1930, and brought to Detroit. It {{is believed to be}} one of a set of three Bruegel works from around the same time, The Wedding Dance, <b>The</b> <b>Peasant</b> Wedding (1567) and <b>The</b> <b>Peasant</b> Dance (1569).|$|E
5|$|The peasants {{were well}} {{organized}} {{and for the}} only time mobilized veritable armies against their rulers, which hadn't happened before. <b>The</b> <b>peasant</b> leaders had clearly learned from previous unsuccessful smaller revolts they had been involved in.|$|E
5|$|The second {{variation}} {{was added}} by Petipa {{to the first}} tableau for the ballerina Emma Bessone's début as Giselle at the Mariinsky Theatre in 1886, and on this occasion the composer Riccardo Drigo wrote the music for the variation. The music was never used again after Bessone's departure from Russia until Agrippina Vaganova added it to <b>the</b> <b>Peasant</b> pas de deux for the Kirov Ballet's production of Giselle in 1932. The inclusion of this variation in <b>the</b> <b>Peasant</b> pas de deux remains part of the Mariinsky Theatre's performance tradition of Giselle to the present day.|$|E
50|$|The case of <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> is more interesting, {{and deserves}} a {{somewhat}} more detailed notice. <b>The</b> <b>peasants</b> formed a class apart, untouched by the influence of Western civilization. This fact was recognized by the legislators of 1864, and beneath the statutory tribunals created in that year the special courts of <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> were suffered to survive. These were indeed {{but a few years}} older.|$|R
50|$|In 779, {{after the}} Carolingians had {{replaced}} the Lombards, the monastery brought <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> to court to enforce their obedience. It won, but <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> did not accept the verdict. In 787, Abbot Paul brought a petition to King Charlemagne, who confirmed Desiderius' grant of Trita to <b>the</b> monastery. <b>The</b> <b>peasants</b> were taken to court again that year and in 822, 823, 824, 854, 872 and 873: a total of eight court cases for which records survive in the cartulary of the monastery. The records also indicate a ninth court challenge, for which the proceedings have not survived, took place. San Vincenzo won every trial, {{but was unable to}} consistently enforce the rulings in the remote area. After the 854 ruling it had some success in forcing corvée from <b>the</b> <b>peasants,</b> who worked twelve weeks a year for the monastery. In January 873, when <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> refused to attend court, the army of the Emperor Louis II, which was in the area, rounded them up and brought them to trial. The cold weather had prevented <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> from taking to higher ground.|$|R
50|$|In 1849, {{the newly}} elected Constituent Assembly gave <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> title to their {{holdings}} with no further obligation to the landlords (this {{is in contrast to}} the previous Land reform in the Habsburg monarchy, which sought to liberate <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> but required them to pay rents). Differences in types of tenure were eliminated, and the distinction between noble and peasant land was obliterated. Nobles were also released from any obligation to <b>the</b> <b>peasants.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> war the city authorities tried {{to suppress the}} memory of this nearly successful revolt. Resistance symbols like the flags or the weapons used by the peasants, in particular their typical clubs with nails on the hitting end (called (Bauern-) Knüttel), were outlawed, confiscated, and destroyed. Documents such as the Bundesbriefe of Huttwil were stashed away in the vaults of the city archives. Any public remembrances or pilgrimages to {{the places where the}} leaders had been executed were forbidden and carried the death penalty, as did the singing of the peasants' war songs. Bern was particularly active in trying to censor the memories of the event and also tried to suppress images of <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> leaders. Historic texts written during the Ancien Régime of Switzerland generally follow the official diction and mention <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> war, if they do so at all, only briefly and in negative terms. Works with differing viewpoints were often prohibited. The censorship was not entirely successful; in private, the rural population kept the memories of 1653 alive, and various accounts of the events were printed in Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Lithuanian Democratic Party and Ernestas Galvanauskas {{used the}} Seimas as an {{opportunity}} to organize <b>the</b> <b>Peasant</b> Union, which largely represented the interests of large and mid-size farmers. The Union helped spread the influence of the Seimas into the countryside. A few days after the Seimas, Jonas Basanavičius founded the Lithuanian National Democratic Party (Lithuanian: Tautiškoji lietuvių demokratų partija), the first nationalistic party in Lithuania.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>peasants</b> {{had been}} working the land since 1900, under British rule, mostly under a crop share {{agreement}}. This agreement continued after independence. The military {{and the government of}} Pakistan imposed a cash rent on the farm land, which <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> tried to resist. There has been a dispute between the military who own the land and <b>the</b> <b>peasants,</b> which has led to military action, imprisoning and killing various members of AMP.|$|R
50|$|This {{aversion to}} be {{accountable}} to someone not from the area was already seen {{during the time of}} W.A. Graham when in 1905, appointed Encik Ibrahim as District Officer for Pasir Puteh. Encik Ibrahim was from Singapore and the district officer overseeing the tax collection in 1915 was Che Abdul Latif, also from Singapore. This suspicion of outsiders was further aggravated especially since the district officer, who was usually understaffed, {{took a long time to}} collect the taxes from <b>the</b> <b>peasants.</b> <b>The</b> <b>peasants</b> were subjected to long queues beforethey were able to pay their dues. Matters were also not made more conducive especially when the officials were often high handed towards <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> when collecting <b>the</b> taxes. Such actions only served to create mistrust and suspicion among <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> towards <b>the</b> British authorities who were not more understanding of the struggle of <b>the</b> <b>peasants.</b>|$|R
50|$|The guerrillas from Comas lacked weapons, <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> being armed {{only with}} spears. <b>The</b> <b>peasants</b> arrested Salazar in early July 1882 on {{the arrival of}} two columns sent by Caceres to reorganize the guerrillas with orders to attack Concepción.|$|R
5|$|The peasants laid siege on Bern and Lucerne, whereupon {{the cities}} {{negotiated}} {{a peace agreement}} with <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> leader Niklaus Leuenberger, the so-called peace on the Murifeld. <b>The</b> <b>peasant</b> armies retreated. The Tagsatzung, the federal council of the Old Swiss Confederacy, then sent an army from Zürich to definitely end the rebellion, and after the Battle of Wohlenschwil, the Huttwil League was forcibly annulled in the peace of Mellingen. The last resistance in the Entlebuch valley was broken {{by the end of}} June. After their victory, the city authorities took drastic punitive measures. The Huttwil League and the peace of the Murifeld were declared null and void by the city council of Bern. Many exponents of the insurrection were captured, tortured, and finally received heavy sentences. Niklaus Leuenberger was beheaded and quartered in Bern on September 6, 1653.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deaths}} of Ivan IV and in 1598 of his son Feodor, the last tsars of the Rurik Dynasty, Russia entered a period of severe dynastic, {{economic}} and social crisis and instability. As Boris Godunov encountered resistance from both <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> masses and the boyar opposition, in the Commonwealth the ideas of turning Russia into a subordinated ally, either through a union, or an imposition of a ruler dependent on the Polish–Lithuanian establishment, were rapidly coming into play.|$|E
5|$|After the {{valuable}} coins were issued, Lépes demanded the tithe {{for the previous}} years in one sum. Historians estimate that <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> families were required to pay six to nine gold florins, although {{the value of an}} average peasant lot was only about 40 florins. Most peasants were unable to pay this amount, especially because they also had to pay the seigneurial taxes to the owners of their parcels.|$|E

"Yes, <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> {{attacked}} <b>the</b> gendarmes, who fled, {{leaving their}} cannon behind them. <b>The</b> <b>peasants</b> took what arms {{there were in}} the municipality, and made a bonfire of the papers. They then, without doing any damage, dispersed to their homes." ...|$|R
50|$|During the German Peasants' War, in 1525, <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> of Alsace {{had decided}} to storm the city of Rosheim. With <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> drawn up at the city gates, Protestant reformers Wolfgang Capito and Martin Bucer (or Butzer) failed to dissuade them from their plans, but after lengthy discussions Josel {{convinced}} them {{to leave the city}} and its Jews in peace. This stood in stark contrast to Sundgau, where <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> had all of the Jews driven from the city.|$|R
60|$|The dragoons had {{expected}} that the mere sight {{of them would be}} sufficient to send <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> flying, and they were amazed that they should continue to advance. As soon as they were within easy range, <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> opened fire. At the first volley the colonel of the dragoons and many of his men fell. Reloading, <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> advanced at a run, poured in a volley at close quarters; and then, with loud cheers, charged the dragoons.|$|R
5|$|Although the {{military}} {{victory of the}} absolutist city authorities was complete, the war had also shown them that they depended very much on their rural subjects. Soon after the war, the ruling aristocrats instituted a series of reforms and even lowered some taxes, thus fulfilling some of the peasants' original fiscal demands. In the long term, <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> war of 1653 prevented Switzerland from an excessive implementation of absolutism as occurred in France {{during the reign of}} Louis XIV.|$|E
5|$|At its root, <b>the</b> <b>peasant</b> war of 1653 {{was caused}} by the rapidly {{changing}} economic circumstances {{after the end of the}} Thirty Years' War. The Swiss Confederacy had been spared from all belligerent action; the Swiss peasants generally had profited from the wartime economy as they had been able to export their agrarian products at higher prices than before. After the Peace of Westphalia, the southern German economy recovered quickly, the Swiss exports dwindled, and the prices for agrarian products dropped. Many Swiss peasants, who had raised mortgages during the boom at wartime, suddenly faced financial problems.|$|E
5|$|Fears grew {{about the}} threat of French raids across England from the 1380s onward. The {{citizens}} of Norwich were particularly concerned about the potential of a French raid on the city, drawing parallels between the position of Norwich {{and the experience of}} Southampton, another trading city that had been devastated by a French attack in 1338. This threat, combined with the recent events of <b>the</b> <b>Peasant</b> Revolt of 1381 when the rebels had looted the city, encouraged the local government to improve the city's defences.|$|E

Children joined the Vanguards, an organization for grade-school boys and girls. Vanguards attended paramilitary summer camps {{operated by the}} armed forces. In the mid-1970s, the party ran a mass campaign for <b>the</b> mobilization of <b>peasants</b> into <b>the</b> <b>Peasants</b> Federation.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>peasants</b> {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about the nobility. On <b>the</b> one hand, <b>peasant</b> songs mentioned noble laziness and shoddy workmanship. Despite nobles' feelings of superiority, during {{the late nineteenth century}} the western Ukrainian nobility had a reputation among <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> of being poorer than peasants because they did not work as hard. Due to the nobility's material poverty, <b>the</b> <b>peasants</b> sometimes viewed <b>the</b> nobles' usage of titles and expressions of superiority as ridiculous. On the other hand, it was considered a great honor in a peasant household if someone married a noble.|$|R
