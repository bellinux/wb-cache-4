500|$|Lee {{became known}} for his [...] "frightening" [...] {{tendency}} to not [...] "mince words". The director often had his cast do numerous takes for a scene {{in order to get}} the perfect shot, and was not afraid to call something [...] "boring" [...] if he disliked it. Thompson later recalled the director would [...] "always come up to you and say something unexpectedly crushing", such as asking her not to [...] "look so old." [...] She also commented, however, that [...] "he doesn't indulge us but is always kind when we fail." [...] Due to Thompson's extensive acting experience, the director encouraged her to practice t'ai chi to [...] "help her relax [...] make her do things simpler." [...] Other actors soon joined them in meditating – according to Doran, it [...] "was pretty interesting. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> pillows on the floor and these pale-looking actors were saying, 'What have we got ourselves into?' [...] was more focused on body language than any director I've ever seen or heard of." [...] He suggested Winslet read books of poetry and report back to him in order to best understand her character. He also had Thompson and Winslet live together to develop their characters' sisterly bond. Many of the cast took lessons in etiquette and riding side-saddle.|$|E
500|$|The sudden {{surge in}} {{popularity}} was disorienting to Iyall. [...] "It was frightening: {{we played a}} college in Santa Barbara, and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> blond people crowding the stage, and I thought 'These {{are the people who}} hated me in high school!' When you grow up being 'outside' – because I wasn't white, and I was fat, and always a bit of a free thinker – it was strange. It was like, 'uh-oh, I must be doing something wrong – they like me!'" [...] Highly successful mainstream artists like Ann Wilson and Ric Ocasek were eager to meet the band. Ocasek extended an invitation to collaborate at his Synchro Sound studio in Boston. The recording sessions in Boston resulted in the Never Say Never EP in January 1982. The title track became (arguably) their best-known song and has remained synonymous with the band ever since. The song was also featured in the 1984 romantic teen drama Reckless. Additionally, the success of the single directly led to 415 Records signing a deal with Columbia Records, which elevated the indie label's roster to major-label status. Romeo Void released their second album, entitled Benefactor, in November 1982. The album appeared at No.119 on the Billboard 200. Benefactor was noticeably more commercial sounding than previous endeavors; the music was made more danceable and swearing was removed on the song [...] "Never Say Never". The different approach in the sound resulted in comparisons to Blondie, which Allmusic writer William Ruhlmann suggested was a deliberate attempt by Columbia. Iyall stated that there was more pressure to write sexually laced lyrics for Benefactor: [...] "I do like to be provocative, and I definitely have access to my sexuality, and as a topic I find it ripe, but I wasn't ever going to be a sex-pot diva, so that was kind of odd." [...] She also said there was pressure to produce more singles.|$|E

[...] The patch which had been provided by Mike Vickers produced six distinctive Moog sounds, and these six became the foundation of ELP's sound.|$|E

I'm a different person today.|$|E
2500|$|According to Weiner, {{he chose}} the 1960s because [...] "every time I would try and find {{something}} interesting that I wanted to do, it happened in 1960. It will blow your mind {{if you look at}} the year on the almanac. And it's not just the election [...] The pill came out in March 1960, that's really what I wanted it to be around.... That's the largest change in the entire world. Seriously, it's just astounding. Especially {{if you look at the}} movies from the 50s. Once it was acceptable to talk about this idea that teenagers were having sex, which they have been doing, obviously, since time immemorial, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> movies like Blue Denim, and Peyton Place ... he central tension in every movie that does not take place on the battlefield is about a girl getting pregnant. So all of a sudden that entire issue [...] has been removed from society. That was what I was interested in in 1960." ...|$|E

I remember there was this chap, Nat Witt, who had been head of the unit at the NLRB, that was responsible for the examiners. I recall that he had been accused from time to time by outside groups for being much tied in with Lee Pressman {{and the two of them}} were very much tied in with the Communist Party. [...] In 1950, the U.S. State Department revoked singer and civil rights activist Paul Robeson's passport as a means of preventing him from traveling overseas and continuing his left-wing political work. Witt was Robeson's first attorney and initiated Robeson's eight-year battle to regain his passport.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1976, Shakespeare left Sherbet citing 'personal reasons'. He later {{explained}} [...] "I couldn't even go out {{the front}} of my house because <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> girls just hanging on the fence [...] There was always a deadline for Garth and me - another album, another tour. When it did finally end, I was relieved more than anything because I had had enough. I left the band early in 1976 for reasons I don't want to discuss fully … but let's just say I wasn't happy about where all the money went". The last single he played on was [...] "Child's Play", which was a No.5 hit in February. Shakespeare was briefly replaced by journeyman guitarist Gunther Gorman (ex-Home) but within weeks a more permanent replacement, Harvey James (ex-Mississippi, Ariel) joined. Meanwhile, Mitchell had stepped up to join Porter as Sherbet's new main songwriting team. The pair were responsible for penning [...] "Howzat" [...] (1976), the band's only international hit, which was inspired by the sport of cricket. The song's success led to an extensive international tour in 1976-77. [...] "Howzat" [...] went to numberone in Australia, and in New Zealand, it was a Top10 hit in several European countries – including numberfour on the UK Singles Chart, numbersix in The Netherlands, and numbereight in Norway. It reached the top10 in South Africa, South-East Asia, and Israel. The single had less chart success in the United States where it reached No.61 on the Billboard Hot100. The album of the same name also made No.1 in Australia, No.12 in New Zealand, but failed to chart in the US.|$|E
6000|$|But for all that, {{his dreams}} were wondrous sweet to indulge and his visions truly {{alluring}} to contemplate.

The victuals he had already provided for, whilst of arms he {{had no need to}} think; Roccaleone should be well stocked with them. But the finding of the men gave him some concern. He had decided to enrol a score, which was surely the smallest number with which he could make a fair show of being martially in earnest. But even though the number was modest, where was he to find twenty fellows who reeked so little of their lives as to embark upon such an enterprise--even if lured by generous pay--and thereby incur the ducal displeasure of Guidobaido? ...|$|E

The bodyguards who stood about him in black skull-caps and with long-shafted lances, preserved an impassive aspect. Across open spaces men could be seen running to the waterside. A group of women standing on a low knoll gazed intently, and nothing of them but the heads showed above the unstirring stalks of a maize field.
