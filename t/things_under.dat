An Iranian police official, citing concerns about possible looting, said all movement {{into and out}} of damaged houses would require prior approval from the governor's office, the police, and the Unexpected Events Committee on the island.

They elaborated that the Iranian authorities [...] "appeared to have <b>things</b> <b>under</b> control".|$|E
500|$|In the Life of Moses, Gregory {{writes that}} just as the {{darkness}} left the Egyptians after three days, perhaps redemption [...] will be extended to those suffering in hell [...] This salvation may not only extend to humans; following Origen, there are passages where he seems to suggest (albeit through the voice of Macrina) that even the demons will {{have a place in}} Christ's [...] "world of goodness". Gregory's interpretations of [...] ("And when all things shall be subdued unto him...") and [...] ("That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and <b>things</b> <b>under</b> the earth") support this understanding of his theology.|$|E

500|$|Lieutenant-General Émile Janssens, the Belgian {{commander}} of the Force Publique, refused to see Congolese independence as marking {{a change in the}} nature of command. The day after the independence festivities, he gathered the black non-commissioned officers of his Léopoldville garrison and told them that <b>things</b> <b>under</b> his command would stay the same, summarising the point by writing [...] "Before Independence = After Independence" [...] on a blackboard. This message was hugely unpopular among the rank and file—many of the men had expected rapid promotions and increases in pay to accompany independence. On 5 July 1960, several units mutinied against their white officers at Camp Hardy near Thysville. The insurrection spread to Léopoldville the next day and later to garrisons across the country.|$|E
500|$|The acting {{was also}} praised by many critics; Lejeune {{wrote that the}} actors portray [...] "real people doing real <b>things</b> <b>under</b> real conditions", while the {{reviewer}} for The Monthly Film Bulletin considered that [...] "a talented cast sees to it that no island character study shall go unnoticed", while the lead roles [...] "make {{the most of their}} opportunities". The reviewer for the Manchester Guardian considered Radford to have played his part [...] "with unusual subtlety", and thought that among the remainder of the cast [...] "there are so many excellent performances that it would be unfair to pick out two or three names for special praise". The critic Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, thought that Radford and Watson were the stand-out actors of the film, although he also considered the rest of the cast strong.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Phillip Resnick, a noted Cleveland {{psychiatrist}} {{said it was}} [...] "a psychiatric medication" [...] and [...] "People {{will say}} <b>things</b> <b>under</b> sodium amytal that are blatantly untrue." [...] In mid-May 1994 in Napa County, California, Gary Ramona won his lawsuit against his daughter's therapist and the psychiatrist who had given her sodium amytal. The psychiatrist claimed the drug helped Ramona's daughter remember specific details of sexual molestation by Ramona, but a court brief written by Martin Orne, a University of Pennsylvania psychiatrist who pioneered research of hypnosis and sodium amytal, stated that the drug is [...] "not useful in ascertaining 'truth' [...] [...] [...] The patient becomes sensitive and receptive to suggestions due to the context and to the comments of the interviewers." [...] This was the first successful legal challenge to the [...] "repressed memory phenomenon". Dr. Kenneth Gottlieb, a San Francisco psychiatrist said, [...] "It’s absolutely a psychiatric drug...I {{would never want to}} use a drug that tampers with a person’s unconscious unless there was no other drug available. And I would not use it without resuscitating equipment, in case of allergic reaction, and only with an M.D. anesthesiologist present." [...] According to Dr. John Yagiela, coordinator of the anesthesia and pain control department of UCLA’s school of dentistry, [...] "It’s unusual for it to be used [...] " [...] and [...] "better, safer alternatives are available." ...|$|E

500|$|With [...] "The Goat and Her Three Kids", written {{mainly as}} a picturesque {{illustration}} of motherly love, Creangă produced a fable in prose, opposing the eponymous characters, caricatures of a garrulous but hard-working {{woman and her}} restless sons, to the sharp-toothed Big Bad Wolf, a satirical depiction of the cunning and immoral stranger. The plot shows the wolf making {{his way into the}} goat's house, where he eats the two older and less obedient kids, while the youngest one manages to escape by hiding up the chimney—the symbolism of which was psychoanalyzed by Dan Grădinaru, who claims it constitutes an allusion to Creangă's own childhood. The dénouement sees an inversion of the natural roles, an episode which, ethnologist Șerban Anghelescu notes, is dominated by [...] "the culinary fire": the goat exercises her brutal revenge by trapping and slowly cooking the predator. This approach partly resonates with that of [...] "The Mother with Three Daughters-in-Law", in which Creangă makes ample use of a traditional theme in Romanian humor, which portrays mothers-in-law as mean, stingy and oppressive characters. The embodiment of such offensive traits, she is also shown to be ingenious, pretending that she has a hidden third eye which always keeps <b>things</b> <b>under</b> watch. The narrator sides with the three young women in depicting their violent retribution, showing them capturing their oppressor, torturing her until she is left speech impaired, and leaving her on the brink of death. The mother-in-law's end turns into a farce: the eldest and most intelligent of the killers manipulates her victim's dying sounds into a testament partitioning her wealth, and a thin decorum is maintained at the funeral ceremony by the daughters' hypocritical sobbing.|$|E

[...] Chicago bandmates have indicated that he was also increasingly unhappy. However, Guercio has said that Kath was working on a solo album before he died, and Pankow adamantly denies that Kath was suicidal.|$|E

The shooting had to postpone again because of Velasquez' pregnancy. Viva Management, together with {{the director of the}} film, Joyce Bernal decided to finish the movie due to the popularity of the characters.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the ruling}} family of Charn, there was {{knowledge}} of an evil spell, the Deplorable Word, which would destroy all life except {{the one who}} spoke it, {{but they did not}} know the word itself. [...] Although her ancestors had bound themselves and their descendants with oaths never even to seek knowledge of this spell, Jadis had sought it out and learned it, saying she paid [...] "a terrible price" [...] to learn it. [...] Her sister knew she had discovered the Deplorable Word, but did not think she would use it. Facing defeat, Jadis spoke the Deplorable Word, which annihilated all living <b>things</b> <b>under</b> the Sun apart from herself.|$|E
