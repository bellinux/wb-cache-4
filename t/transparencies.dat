In addressing these questions, the authors review six interrelated types of <b>transparency</b> and nine governance- and citizen-related outcomes of <b>transparency.</b> Based {{on the findings of}} the analysis, the authors outline an agenda for future research on government <b>transparency</b> and its effects that calls for more systematically investigating the ways in which contextual conditions shape <b>transparency</b> outcomes, replicating studies with varying methodologies, investigating <b>transparency</b> in neglected countries, and paying greater attention to understudied claims of <b>transparency</b> such as improved decision making and management...|$|R

40|$|This article {{contributes}} to the growing literature on <b>transparency</b> by developing a theoretical framework to analyse {{the relation between the}} AIS integration level and the <b>transparency</b> level in the Italian public sector. Based on the literature review regarding <b>transparency</b> and IIS, a research model is proposed. The AIS integration level is measured through three dimensions: part integration, full system integration and full information integration. The <b>transparency</b> level is assessed by the following dimensions: formal <b>transparency,</b> quality <b>transparency</b> and full <b>transparency.</b> The framework shows how different AIS integration levels match with various <b>transparency</b> characteristics. Higher levels of AIS integration enable an increase in the characteristics of <b>transparency</b> and guarantee its effectiveness and interactivity. In contrast, lower levels of AIS integration determine a sufficient and minimum degree of <b>transparency</b> that is evaluated only through the existence or the nonexistence of the information on the public organisation website...|$|R
40|$|Scholars' {{criticism}} of <b>transparency</b> in public-private partnerships (PPPs) often focuses on ‘external’ <b>transparency,</b> that is, {{the extent to}} which internal information is visible to the outside world. However, to achieve external <b>transparency,</b> internal <b>transparency</b> - the availability and inferability of information for the public procurer and the private party - is crucial. In this article we analyse input, process, and output <b>transparency</b> from three different perspectives (institutional, cognitive, and strategic) in four PPPs in the Netherlands. We conclude that[*]input <b>transparency</b> is high, but process and output <b>transparency</b> less so. Moreover, output <b>transparency</b> has gained importance in PPPs. Whether this is problematic depends on the PPPs' institutional environment. In some partnerships the desired output is uncontested and predetermined by clear standards in the institutional environment, whereas other PPPs deal with contested output norms, decreasing the partnerships' <b>transparency.</b> These results nuance the current debate on the lack of <b>transparency</b> in PPPs...|$|R

Before Nixie tubes became prominent, most numeric displays were electromechanical, using stepping mechanisms to display digits either directly {{by use of}} cylinders bearing printed numerals attached to their rotors, or indirectly by wiring the outputs of stepping switches to indicator bulbs. Later, a few vintage clocks even used a form of stepping switch to drive Nixie tubes.|$|E

25|$|The {{works of}} Gris and Metzinger painted {{during the war}} employ <b>transparencies</b> that blur the {{distinction}} between the background and the figure. Rather than gradients of tone or color, these works are painted with flat, uniform sections of tone and color. Albeit, in Femme au miroir Metzinger uses a textured surface in the lighter blue areas. Some minimal brushstrokes remain visible throughout these paintings. Each represents objects or elements of the real world; such as perfume bottles, moulding of the walls, an ear ring; and human figures. Most outstanding of all, however, is the angular juxtaposition of the surface planes, which the works hold in common.|$|E
40|$|<b>Transparency</b> {{has become}} a {{catchword}} and in the economic-political debate is often seen as a universal remedy {{for all sorts of}} problems. In this paper, we analyze and discuss the meaning and use of the concept of <b>transparency</b> in economic research. We look for common denominators across different areas where the concept is used, and find that <b>transparency</b> in essence is about reductions in information asymmetries, and therefore entails the transfer of information from a sender to a receiver. <b>Transparency</b> goes beyond mere information disclosure in that it has a demand-side dimension: the information transferred should be trustworthy and have a value to the receiver. We emphasize the distinction between ex ante <b>transparency</b> - related to predictability - and ex post <b>transparency</b> - related to accountability. In economics, increased <b>transparency</b> is mostly rationalized on grounds of improving efficiency, but sometimes <b>transparency</b> is properly viewed simply as a right to know. Complementarities between different types of <b>transparency</b> are pervasive, and its causes and effects typically co-determined - i. e. <b>transparency</b> is endogenous. As a means to improve competitiveness and economic growth, <b>transparency</b> of economic policy and corporate as well as institutional <b>transparency</b> interact. We challenge the view that more <b>transparency</b> is always better and argue for concave net benefits and the existence of optimal <b>transparency,</b> but optimality varies across policy areas, institutional settings, industries and individual firms...|$|R
