5|$|Although the United States Navy was {{prevented}} from developing fortifications on the Aleutian Islands {{due to the}} terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, the Navy believed that at some point the United States' <b>treaty</b> <b>obligations</b> would no longer apply, and began to scout the Aleutians for possible naval bases. In 1923, two scouting ships investigated the possibility of establishing anchorages off the Islands, and attempted to claim the United States Army's bases on the Aleutians for the purposes of national security.|$|E
5|$|Human rights {{agreements}} require most {{governments to}} provide {{family planning and}} contraceptive information and services. These include the requirement to create a national plan for family planning services, remove laws that limit access to family planning, ensure that {{a wide variety of}} safe and effective birth control methods are available including emergency contraceptives, make sure there are appropriately trained healthcare providers and facilities at an affordable price, and create a process to review the programs implemented. If governments fail to do the above it may put them in breach of binding international <b>treaty</b> <b>obligations.</b>|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s the Japanese {{government}} {{adopted an}} ultranationalist militancy {{with a view}} to greatly expand the Japanese Empire. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in 1934, renouncing its <b>treaty</b> <b>obligations.</b> After withdrawing from the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited the size and power of capital ships, the Imperial Japanese Navy began their design of the new Yamato class of heavy battleships. Their planners recognized Japan would be unable to compete with the output of U.S. naval shipyards should war break out, so the 70,000ton vessels of the Yamato class were designed to be capable of engaging multiple enemy battleships at the same time.|$|E
5|$|In {{supporting}} the war effort, India was left vulnerable to hostile action from Afghanistan. A Turco-German mission arrived in Kabul in October 1915, with obvious strategic purpose. Habibullah Khan abided by his <b>treaty</b> <b>obligations</b> and maintained Afghanistan's neutrality, {{in the face}} of internal opposition from factions keen to side with the Ottoman Sultan. Despite this, localised actions along the frontier still took place and included Operations in the Tochi (1914–15), Operations against the Mohmands, Bunerwals and Swatis (1915), Kalat Operations (1915–16), Mohmand Blockade (1916–17), Operations against the Mahsuds (1917) and Operations against the Marri and Khetran tribes (1918).|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} briefly {{retained}} by the Reichsmarine after the war, and was reactivated for service on 1 August 1919. According to Articles 182 and 193 of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany {{was obliged to}} keep sufficient vessels in commission to sweep mines from large areas in the North and Baltic Seas. Schwaben was therefore converted into a depot ship for F-type minesweepers to assist in meeting Germany's <b>treaty</b> <b>obligations,</b> which entailed removal of her remaining weaponry and construction of platforms to hold the minesweepers. She {{was assigned to the}} 6th Baltic Minesweeping Half-Flotilla, though this service did not last long, as the minesweeping work was completed by 19 June 1920. The old battleship was stricken from the naval register on 8 March 1921. She was sold for 3,090,000marks and broken up for scrap that year in Kiel-Nordmole.|$|E

5|$|Between 1158–1162, {{a series}} of Byzantine campaigns against the Seljuk Turks of the Sultanate of Rûm {{resulted}} in a treaty favourable to the Empire. According to the agreement, certain frontier regions, including the city of Sivas, should be handed over to Manuel in return for some quantity of cash, while it also obliged the Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II to recognize his overlordship. Kilij Arslan II used the peace with Byzantium, and the power vacuum caused by the death in 1174 of Nur ad-Din Zangi the ruler of Syria, to expel the Danishmends from their Anatolian emirates. When the Seljuk sultan refused to cede some of the territory he had taken from the Danishmends to the Byzantines, as he was obliged to do {{as part of his}} <b>treaty</b> <b>obligations,</b> Manuel decided {{that it was time to}} deal with the Turks once and for all. Therefore, he assembled the full imperial army and marched against the Seljuk capital, Iconium (Konya). Manuel's strategy was to prepare the advanced bases of Dorylaeum and Sublaeum, and then to use them to strike as quickly as possible at Iconium.|$|E

25|$|Deringer's early {{efforts were}} for {{military}} contracts, producing military pistols, muskets and rifles. Among those he produced was the Model 1814 Common Rifle and the Model 1817 Common Rifle. He produced trade rifles, designated for the Native American tribes, {{to fulfill the}} U.S. <b>treaty</b> <b>obligations.</b> His specialties became fine sporting rifles and dueling pistols. He stopped pursuing the government contracts by the mid-1840s.|$|E

50|$|States that {{ratified}} the United Nations Convention Against Torture have a <b>treaty</b> <b>obligation</b> {{to include the}} provisions into municipal law.

25|$|Federal {{involvement}} in the territories was considerable. In addition to direct subsidies, the federal government maintained military posts, provided safety from Indian attacks, bankrolled <b>treaty</b> <b>obligations,</b> conducted surveys and land sales, built roads, staffed land offices, made harbour improvements, and subsidized overland mail delivery. Territorial citizens came to both decry federal power and local corruption, {{and at the same}} time, lament that more federal dollars were not sent their way.|$|E
25|$|Socii or Foederati were {{citizens}} of states which had <b>treaty</b> <b>obligations</b> with Rome, under which typically certain legal {{rights of the}} state's citizens under Roman law were exchanged for agreed levels of military service, i.e. the Roman magistrates {{had the right to}} levy soldiers for the Roman legions from those states. However, Foederati states that had at one time been conquered by Rome were exempt from payment of tribute to Rome due to their treaty status.|$|E
25|$|The Iranian {{authorities}} {{assert that}} they cannot simply trust the United States or Europe to provide Iran with nuclear energy fuel, {{and point to}} {{a long series of}} agreements, contracts and <b>treaty</b> <b>obligations</b> which were not fulfilled.

25|$|In most cases, the socius sole <b>treaty</b> <b>obligation</b> to Rome was {{to supply}} to the confederate army, on demand, a number of fully {{equipped}} troops up to a specified maximum each year.
