25|$|Through {{their control}} of the region's wells, the Garen rulers {{effectively}} held a monopoly over their nomadic subjects as {{they were the only}} hydraulic empire in Africa during their reign. Large wells made out of limestone were constructed throughout the state, which attracted Somali and Oromo nomads with their livestock. The centralized regulations of the wells made it easier for the nomads to settle disputes by taking their queries to government officials who would act as mediators. Long distance caravan trade, a long-time practice in the Horn of Africa, continued unchanged in Ajuran <b>times.</b> <b>Today,</b> numerous ruined and abandoned towns throughout the interior of Somalia and the Horn of Africa are evidence of a once-booming inland trade network dating from the medieval period.|$|E

2500|$|In 1950–1951 I.E. Tamm and A.D. Sakharov in the Soviet Union, first {{discussed}} a tokamak-like approach. Experimental research on those designs began in 1956 at the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow {{by a group}} of Soviet scientists led by Lev Artsimovich. The tokamak essentially combined a low-power pinch device with a low-power simple stellarator. The key was to combine the fields {{in such a way that}} the particles orbited within the reactor a particular number of <b>times,</b> <b>today</b> known as the [...] "safety factor". The combination of these fields dramatically improved confinement times and densities, resulting in huge improvements over existing devices.|$|E

2500|$|The {{different}} spellings {{originate from}} the different languages that used the title throughout the ages (a phenomenon called lenition). [...] The word [...] "palatine" [...] evolved from the Latin word palatinus, asserting {{a connection to the}} Palatine Hill, where the house of the Roman emperor was situated since Augustus (hence [...] "palace"). The meaning of the term hardly changed, since Latin was the dominant language in medieval writing. But its spelling slightly changed in European languages: Latin palatinus, plural palatini was still an office in Merovingian <b>times,</b> <b>today</b> referred to as the Count Palatine. The word became in French palaisin, and with the Norman dynasty entered the English language as palatine. The word paladin, referring to one of the legendary Twelve Peers of Charlemagne in the Matter of France, is also related.|$|E

Historically, Kurdish and Persian Arabian horses were the most widely used for polo.

2500|$|For centuries {{local people}} used wooden {{embankments}} and dredging {{to try to}} maintain a navigable channel on the river, as it was critical to transportation. River traffic increased gradually, with a toll system being used in medieval <b>times.</b> <b>Today</b> some of these toll bridges still remain, dated to over 800 years. During the 17th century, Jean-Baptiste Colbert instituted the use of stone retaining walls and quays from Roanne to Nantes, which helped make the river more reliable, but navigation was still frequently stopped by excessive conditions during flood and drought. In 1707, floods {{were said to have}} drowned 50,000 people in the river valley, with the water rising more than [...] in two hours in Orléans. Typically passenger travel downriver from Orléans to Nantes took eight days, with the upstream journey against the flow taking fourteen. It was also a dumping ground for prisoners in the War in the Vendee since they thought it was a more effective way of killing.|$|E

The song was released via iTunes on September 22, 2011. During an interview with MTV News, Calvin Harris revealed, [...] "'We Found Love,' is the most successful thing I've done ever... It's not strictly a song by me, obviously, it's by Rihanna. She sings it...It was great to work with her... No one could have taken {{it as far as}} she did. You can't escape it here [...] I've heard it a lot. I've heard it probably more <b>times</b> <b>today</b> than I did when I was mixing it. Which is a good thing... Ever since the Rihanna song did well, {{a lot of people want}} to do some stuff, which is great... That's what I enjoy doing. In terms of actual names, I've not done anything yet." [...] In October 2012, British singer Leona Lewis claimed that she was originally chosen to sing the song but ended up losing it to Rihanna when Harris went touring with the latter, commenting. [...] "I didn’t commit to it because I wanted [...] "Trouble" [...] to be my first single so I think that was another reason they went with Rihanna. It was the same version and production but mine’s better." [...] In 2013, Nicole Scherzinger claimed that she was the first artist given the song but ended up rejecting it, commenting. [...] "I've got the demo of that song and I was busy at the time. They'd sent me a few dance tracks and I wasn't able to get to them and I was like, 'Oh there's so much dance and I want to take a break from it." ...|$|E
