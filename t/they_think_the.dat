5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas {{to determine which}} stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations {{in which a person}} has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E

25|$|A {{publication}} {{posted on}} Statistics Canada {{reported that in}} 2009, {{only a small portion}} of crimes that happen are reported to the police (31% of all crimes), and this figure has been lowering from 1999 (37%) and 2004 (34%). Only 54% of break and enters, 43% of robberies, and 34% of assaults are reported to the police. The most common reason for not reporting a crime was the victim thought it was not important enough (68%). Other common reasons include; <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> police cannot do anything about it (59%), or they dealt with it another way (42%). Keep in mind people can give multiple reasons, thus why the percentages equal well over 100%.|$|E

25|$|The Smiley face murder theory (variations include Smiley face murders, Smiley face killings, Smiley face gang, and others) is {{a theory}} {{advanced}} by two retired New York City detectives, Kevin Gannon and Anthony Duarte, {{that a number of}} young men found dead in bodies of water across several Midwestern American states over the last decade did not accidentally drown, as concluded by law enforcement agencies, but were victims of a serial killer or killers. The term smiley face became connected to the alleged murders when it was made public that the police had discovered graffiti depicting a smiley face near locations where <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> killer dumped the bodies in at least a dozen of the cases. The response of law enforcement investigators and other experts to Gannon and Duarte's theory has been largely skeptical.|$|E

500|$|Harring {{described}} her interpretation {{after seeing the}} film: [...] "When I saw it the first time, I {{thought it was the}} story of Hollywood dreams, illusion and obsession. It touches on the idea that nothing is quite as it seems, especially the idea of being a Hollywood movie star. The second and third times I saw it, I thought it dealt with identity. Do we know who we are? And then I kept seeing different things in it... There's no right or wrong to what someone takes away from it or what <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> film is really about. It's a movie that makes you continuously ponder, makes you ask questions. I've heard over and over, 'This is a movie that I'll see again' or 'This is a movie you've got to see again.' It intrigues you. You want to get it, but I don't think it's a movie to be gotten. It's achieved its goal if it makes you ask questions." ...|$|E

As Rootes recalls, [...] "I admit every time me and Bridged cleaned our house we put Elastica on". Despite this, she considers Elastica, along with the Sex Pistols and the Buzzcocks, as the only UK bands among her favorites. The band cited the Sex Pistols, the New York Dolls, and The Stooges as their musical influences. They also preferred the Sex Pistols over the Clash. According to Rootes, [...] "The Sex Pistols are political in a great teenage fuck-you way. The Clash are political in a mature way, like they've done politics in A-levels." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1993, Kevin Yagher, a make-up effects {{designer}} {{who had turned}} to directing with Tales from the Crypt, had the notion to adapt Washington Irving's short story [...] "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" [...] into a feature film. Through his agent, Yagher was introduced to Andrew Kevin Walker; they spent a few months working on a film treatment that transformed Ichabod Crane as a schoolmaster from Connecticut to a banished New York City detective. Yagher and Walker subsequently pitched Sleepy Hollow to various studios and production companies, eventually securing a deal with producer Scott Rudin, who had been impressed with Walker's unproduced spec script for Seven. Rudin optioned the project to Paramount Pictures in a deal that had Yagher set to direct, with Walker scripting; the pair would share story credit. Following the completion of , Yahger had planned Sleepy Hollow as a low-budget production—"a pretentious slasher film with a spectacular murder every five minutes or so." [...] Paramount disagreed on the concept and demoted Yagher's involvement to prosthetic makeup designer.

Instead, they {{convince}} the girls to wear purity rings as a pledge to abstinence, and tell them to get all of their friends to start wearing them as well because [...] "That is just the way we roll" [...] (a reference to one of their songs). To appease his girlfriend, Kenny reluctantly begins wearing a purity ring. As Kenny becomes dull as a result and ceases to spend time with his friends, it is revealed that the Jonas Brothers are being forced to wear and promote purity rings by their boss, Mickey Mouse. He is fearsome, greedy, sadistic, and foul-mouthed, and verbally berates and violently beats them when they complain that the rings are overshadowing their music and projecting the wrong message. Mickey explains that the rings allow him to sell sexual stimulation to young girls while giving the false appearance of innocence and purity. Concerned for their friend, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman attempt to confront the Jonas Brothers at a televised appearance in Denver; but Mickey, mistaking the boys for secret agents hired by DreamWorks (or Michael Eisner) to sabotage the televised appearance, tranquilizes them and takes them prisoner backstage.|$|E
