5|$|Playtex-branded <b>tampons</b> were {{introduced}} in the 1960s and became the primary competition to incumbent Tampax. Playtex invented the plastic tampon applicator in 1973. It {{was one of the}} tampon manufacturers that were sued for aggressively advertising over-absorbent <b>tampons,</b> which led to toxic shock syndrome.|$|E
5|$|According to Energizer Holdings' 2012 annual report, Playtex Products LLC is {{the largest}} {{producer}} of household gloves, hand wipes and sunscreen, {{as well as the}} second largest producer of <b>tampons</b> in the US. The best-selling Playtex tampon is the Gentle Glide brand, which was first introduced in 1973. It also manufactures the Playtex Sport tampon, which targets young athletes. Both brands are sold in regular, super and super-plus absorbency. Playtex had a 29 percent share of a $550 million market for <b>tampons</b> in 1994 and a 30 percent share of a $780 million market by 2000.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tampon</b> {{commercials}} have advertised, “created {{by female}} gynecologists” for years but these gynecologists had always stayed anonymous. Women have invented <b>tampon</b> and sanitary napkins for years, {{but it was}} not until 1936 when Dr. Esser-Mittag created the new design to the age-old product which resulted in a digital <b>tampon,</b> known as an o.b. <b>tampon.</b> A digital <b>tampon</b> means that it can be applied using one's digits, or fingers. The o.b. <b>tampon</b> consists of rolled fiber-pad layers that supposedly expands uniformly from all sides, filling the vaginal cavity more completely than a less flexible <b>tampon.</b> It is more efficient in guarding against leaks. Cotton and rayon layers achieve the necessary absorbency.|$|R

5|$|A {{cancerous}} patient, Marina Wagner (Amanda Collins), {{is admitted}} {{into the hospital}} and is revealed to have toxic blood - presumably caused by a chemical reaction between an herbal supplement and chemotherapy - making several physicians fall ill. O'Malley is exposed to the neurotoxin, and quickly becomes anxious, fearing that his marriage is the cause of the sickness. Ellis is diagnosed with a heart condition, in which surgery or medication are options. Ellis does not want the surgery, but Meredith fears that she will not be compliant with her medication. Shepherd and Burke try to close up Wagner as the OR was evacuated before her surgery was completed, by entering the operating room with sealed, airtight suits. Ellis agrees to the surgery, but opts to speak with Webber, her former lover. A teenage patient is brought into the clinic by her father, hoping that a doctor can teach her how to use <b>tampons.</b> When her father leaves the room, she explains to Bailey that she had sex, but her pregnancy test is negative. Shepherd and Burke run out of air whilst operating on Wagner, so Yang, Stevens, and Meredith enter holding their breath to close the patient's incision. O'Malley's colleagues act in a rude manner to his new marriage, and displeased, he lectures them, standing up for Torres. Sloan is seen to be having sex with Montgomery, and Yang agrees to marry Burke. At the conclusion of the episode, Ellis' lucidity has vanished, leaving Meredith and Webber distraught.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, 814 menstrual-related TSS {{cases were}} reported; 38 deaths {{resulted}} from the disease. The majority of women in these cases were documented as using super-absorbent synthetic <b>tampons,</b> particularly the Rely tampon created by Procter & Gamble. The Rely tampon was so super-absorbent that one by itself could, in fact, hold one woman's entire menstrual period flow. Unlike other <b>tampons</b> made of cotton and rayon, Rely used carboxymethylcellulose and compressed beads of polyester for absorption.|$|E

30|$|The {{questionnaire}} {{is being}} revised for this survey based on learning from Chatzoudi and Franklin’ survey. The questionnaire for dentists includes 6 closed questions (Chatzoudi 2009): whether they provide verbal postoperative-advices to patients; whether they provide written postoperative-advices to patients; whether they give patients extra <b>tampon</b> {{in case the}} initial <b>tampon</b> does not adequately control the bleeding; whether their postoperative-advices give an explanation to their patients about how {{to dispose of the}} blood-contaminated tampon; whether they give special advices on disposal of <b>tampon</b> to the patients with blood-transmitted diseases, such as hepatitis, AIDS, and syphilis; whether they provide self-sealing plastic bag to patients. The questionnaire for patients includes 5 closed questions (Franklin and Laskin 2014): the most likely ways in which they finally throw the blood-contaminated tampon; whether they wash theirs hands immediately and thoroughly after they touch the <b>tampon</b> by hand; whether they know the blood-contaminated <b>tampon</b> may cause cross infection; whether the patients know how to dispose of the blood-contaminated <b>tampon</b> correctly; whether they dispose of the blood-contaminated <b>tampon</b> carefully if they have blood-transmitted disease.|$|R
40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the acceptability of self-collected <b>tampon</b> samples for the screening of female sex workers for sexually transmitted infections. We recruited 65 sex workers, and 63 agreed to provide <b>tampon</b> samples. The <b>tampon</b> samples were processed by realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Urethral and endocervical swabs were also obtained from 61 of 63 participants and tested using culture (N. gonorrhoeae) and the BD ProbeTec strand displacement amplification (SDA) (C. trachomatis) assay. <b>Tampon</b> sampling was preferred by 95 % {{of the women and}} all favoured being tested away from genitourinary medicine clinics; the most common reasons cited were avoidance of embarrassment (40 %) and convenience (30 %). Besides near-universal acceptability of <b>tampon</b> sampling, the <b>tampon</b> sampling-PCR approach described in this study appeared to have enhanced sensitivity compared with conventional testing, suggesting the possibility of a residual hidden burden of N. gonorrhoeae and/or C. trachomatis genital infections in UK female sex workers. 1539...|$|R
25|$|A tampon is {{a mass of}} {{absorbent}} material into a body cavity or wound to absorb bodily fluid. The most common type in daily use is disposable and designed to be inserted into the vagina during menstruation to absorb the flow of blood. The ancient Egyptians first invented disposable <b>tampons</b> made of softened papyrus around 2500 B.C. The ancient Greeks followed this with <b>tampons</b> made from lint wrapped around {{a small piece of}} wood. But it was not until 1929 that Earle Haas of Denver, Colorado first invented the modern tampon with an applicator. Dr. Haas submitted the design for patent in 1931, and in 1936, the tampon was first sold in the United States. He later gave his invention the brandname Tampax, which {{is still one of the}} main tampon brands today.|$|E
25|$|Toxic shock {{syndrome}} (TSS) {{is a disease}} caused by strains of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. Most people have these bacteria living in their bodies as harmless commensals {{in places such as}} the nose, skin, and vagina. The disease can strike anyone, not only women, but the disease is often associated with <b>tampons.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the United States streptococcal TSS {{occurs in}} about 3 per 100,000 per year while staphylococcal TSS occurs in about 0.5 per 100,000 per year. The {{condition}} {{is more common}} in the developing world. It was first described in 1927. Due to the association with very absorbent <b>tampons,</b> these products were removed from sale.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{confirm the}} safety of a new {{experimental}} Tampax ® <b>tampon</b> and applicator compared with that of a currently marketed Tampax ® <b>tampon</b> and applicator using comprehensive gynecological and microbiological assessments. Methods: A 2 -month, single-blind, randomized, crossover study was conducted in which each subject served as her own control. Safety was evaluated by comparing potential product-related irritation (using colposcopic examination and subject diary data), assessment of vaginal discharge, vaginal pH, and effects on selected microorganisms (yeast, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and group B streptococci) obtained by vaginal swab cultures after normal menstrual use in the experimental and control groups. Results: In total, 110 women completed the study. There {{were no significant differences between}} the groups that used either the experimental or control <b>tampon</b> with regard to prevalence or mean cell density for the selected microorganisms. No differences were observed in the incidence or severity of erythema, in abrasion or ulceration of the cervix, vagina, introitus, vulva or perineum, or in mean vaginal pH and discharge assessments. There were equivalent low incidences of reported symptoms such as discomfort during insertion, wear or removal, and a similar low incidence of burning, stinging or itching during use of either the control or experimental <b>tampon.</b> There was a more favorable overall product rating for the experimental <b>tampon</b> (p = 0. 003). Conclusions: This approach provides a combination of gynecological, microbiological and self-reported (diary recall) methodologies in order to assess <b>tampon</b> safety during use more thoroughly than has previously been reported, and it supports a comparable safety profile for the experimental <b>tampon</b> and a currently marketed <b>tampon...</b>|$|R
30|$|In {{cases in}} which vaginal {{ulceration}} occurring with <b>tampon</b> use fails to respond to discontinuation of <b>tampon</b> use, we would recommend the consideration of prolonged use of prednisolone pessaries vaginally as a possible alternative, although this may require some negotiation with the local pharmacist.|$|R
25|$|Further, {{either a}} change in pH balance or {{introduction}} of foreign bacteria in the vagina can lead to infectious vaginitis. Physical factors that have been claimed {{to contribute to the}} development of infections include the following: constantly wet vulva due to tight clothing, chemicals coming in contact with the vagina via scented <b>tampons,</b> antibiotics, birth control pills, or a diet favoring refined sugar and yeast.|$|E
25|$|In a {{minority}} of people, anal plugs may be useful for either standalone therapy or in concert with other treatments. Anal plugs (sometimes termed <b>tampons)</b> aim to block involuntary loss of fecal material, and they vary in design and composition. Polyurethane plugs were reported to perform better than those made of polyvinyl-alcohol. Plugs {{are less likely to}} help those with frequent bowel movements, and many find them difficult to tolerate.|$|E
25|$|TSS {{is caused}} by {{bacteria}} of either the Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus type. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is {{sometimes referred to as}} toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS). The underlying mechanism involves the production of superantigens during an invasive streptococcus infection or a localized staphylococcus infection. Risk factors for the staphylococcal type include the use of very absorbent <b>tampons</b> and skin lesions in young children. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms.|$|E

25|$|It {{was shown}} later that higher {{absorbency}} of <b>tampons</b> {{was associated with}} an increased risk for TSS, regardless of the chemical composition or the brand of the tampon. The sole exception was Rely, for which the risk for TSS was still higher when corrected for its absorbency. The ability of carboxymethylcellulose to filter the S. aureus toxin that causes TSS may account for the increased risk associated with Rely.|$|E

50|$|A <b>tampon</b> {{is placed}} into the vagina. If the <b>tampon</b> turns blue, vesicovaginal fistula is suspected. If the <b>tampon</b> turns orange, ureterovaginal fistula is suspected. If the <b>tampon</b> turns blue and orange, suspect a {{combination}} of vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulae. It {{is important to be}} alert for leakage around the catheter, which may spill back into the vagina creating the false impression of a fistula. It is also important to ensure that adequate distension of the bladder occurs as some fistulae do not leak at small volumes; conversely, some fistulae with an oblique track through the bladder wall may leak at small volumes, but not at capacity. Direct inspection of leaking dye in vagina in lithotomy position is better than the traditional 'three swab test' as multiple fistulae may be located in this way.|$|R
