5|$|A large {{structure}} in Bartow County was significantly damaged by wind gusts, causing almost $10,000dollars (2005USD) in damage. In Douglas County, a tree fell {{on a car}} on Interstate20 causing damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle,</b> although no injuries were reported. In another incident, a tree was blown onto a home on Campbellton Street, causing damage to the structure. Several trees and power lines down in Fulton County, with the worst damage in the southwest portions of the county. Several of trees were also down in the Roswell area. The Roswell Cat Clinic was forced to close when a large tree damaged the facility. Also, a home in North Atlanta was damaged when a large oak tree fell on its deck. U.S. Route 100 had to be closed {{for a brief period}} because of downed trees in Hall County. In all, wind damage totaled up to $246,000dollars (2005USD).|$|E
5|$|Ambulances {{often have}} two manufacturers. The first is {{frequently}} {{a manufacturer of}} light trucks or full-size vans (or previously, cars) such as Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Toyota, or Ford. The second manufacturer (known as second stage manufacturer) purchases the vehicle (which is sometimes purchased incomplete, having no body or interior behind the driver's seat) and turns it into an ambulance by adding bodywork, emergency vehicle equipment, and interior fittings. This is done by one of two methods – either coachbuilding, where the modifications are started from scratch and built on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle,</b> or using a modular system, where a pre-built 'box' is put on to the empty chassis of the ambulance, and then finished off.|$|E
40|$|VANET means Vehicular Adhoc Network {{which is}} an {{upcoming}} field and a new technology for intelligent transportation system.

The {{most important part of}} VANET is the broadcasting of <b>the</b> messages <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> in order <b>to</b> solve <b>the</b> problems like building shadow, connection hole and intersection problems. VANET sends emergency messages <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In most applications VANET need to broadcast messages periodically <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other <b>vehicles</b> regarding <b>to</b> their positions. These broadcasting messages make it easy <b>to</b> track <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> in case of any anomaly. In this paper we study the different broadcasting schemes for broadcasting emergency messages...|$|R

50|$|Weight {{transfer}} {{occurs as}} <b>the</b> <b>vehicle's</b> CoM shifts during automotive maneuvers. Acceleration causes <b>the</b> sprung mass <b>to</b> rotate about a geometric axis resulting in relocation of the CoM.

In Bilad Al Qadeem, protesters held a sit-in at afternoon and started marching at evening, after which {{security forces}} intervened to disperse them. In Karzakan, protesters staged a march that was joined by another march starting in Dumistan and ended peacefully. In Duraz security forces fired tear gas on 100 protesters, breaking up their rally.|$|E
5|$|The bear follows {{and climbs}} {{on top of}} the Jeep, smashing up the car and {{eventually}} overturning it before leaving as the sun sets. Sean wakes up and tells them about the hunting paraphernalia, crying about wanting to go home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right side up, load him back in the car, then push the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the buildings. While Lauren is exploring the building with the trap, the bear swings at her through a window sending her back against the trap, which impales her back. She returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> where the bear rips off the tailgate and drags away Sean's body.|$|E
5|$|The {{low-pressure}} oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP) is an {{axial-flow pump}} which operates at approximately 5,150 rpm {{driven by a}} six-stage turbine powered by high-pressure liquid oxygen from the high-pressure oxidizer turbopump (HPOTP). It boosts the liquid oxygen's pressure from , with the flow from the LPOTP then being supplied to the HPOTP. During engine operation, the pressure boost permits the high-pressure oxidizer turbine to operate at high speeds without cavitating. The LPOTP, which measures approximately , is connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> propellant ducting and supported in a fixed position by being mounted on the launch vehicle's structure.|$|E

The reports then state that after Acoli complied, and as Harper was looking inside the vehicle to examine the registration, Trooper Foerster yelled and held up an ammunition magazine as Shakur simultaneously reached into her red pocketbook, pulled out a nine-millimeter weapon and fired at him. Trooper Harper's reports then state that he ran to the rear of his car and shot at Shakur who had exited the vehicle and was firing from a crouched position next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Each Space Shuttle {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure of the Space Shuttle orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Assembly Building. If necessary the engines could be changed on the pad. The engines, drawing propellant from the Space Shuttle external tank (ET) via the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS), were ignited at T−6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the shuttle to the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} throttled back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the shuttle stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max Q. The engines would then be throttled back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Preparation for {{the mission}} began on June 3, with the {{assembly}} of the shuttle's solid rocket boosters (SRB) on the Mobile Launcher Platform. The boosters were stacked on June 20, 1983, and the external tank mated to the assembly on June 23. Challenger arrived at Kennedy Space Center on June 29, and {{was transferred to the}} Orbiter Processing Facility on June 30. After post-flight maintenance and preparation for the new mission, including the installation of most flight payloads, the shuttle was transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Assembly Building on July 27, and mated to the booster/tank stack. The stack was checked out on July 29 and 30, and moved to Launch Complex 39A on August 2, 1983. INSAT-1B was loaded into the orbiter when on the pad; the overall processing time from Challenger arriving at KSC to being ready for launch was only sixty-two days, a record for the program at the time.|$|E

5|$|The A2 is a tolled motorway, {{based on}} the vehicle {{classification}} in Croatia, using a closed toll system. As of July 2011, the toll charged along the A2 route between the Zaprešić and Trakošćan mainline toll plazas varies depending {{on the length of}} route travelled, ranging from 1.00 kuna (0.13 euros) to 42.00 kuna (5.48 euros) for passenger cars and 47.00 kuna (6.13 euro) to 187.00 kuna (24.40 euro) for semi-trailer trucks. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros and by major credit and debit cards. A prepaid toll collection system is also used. The A2 is the only motorway in Croatia which does not provide for use of the ENC—an electronic toll collection (ETC) system shared by most motorways in Croatia that provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> classification in Croatia, the motorway operator maintains an additional vehicle category for motorbikes, which are charged from 7.00 kuna (0.91 euros) to 25.00 kuna (3.26 euros) toll. The southernmost Jankomir–Zaprešić section of the motorway is not tolled, as {{it is part of the}} Zagreb bypass.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Turnpike {{uses the}} ticket system of tolling between the Warrendale and Neshaminy Falls toll plazas, {{as well as}} on the Northeast Extension to Wyoming Valley. When {{entering}} the turnpike, motorists receive a ticket listing the toll for each exit; the ticket is surrendered when exiting, and the applicable toll is paid. If the ticket is lost, motorists are charged the maximum toll for that exit. Cash, credit cards, and E-ZPass are accepted at traditional toll plazas. An eastbound mainline toll plaza is located at Gateway near the Ohio border, charging a flat toll using cash or E-ZPass, and an all-electronic westbound mainline toll gantry is located at the Delaware River Bridge near the New Jersey border, charging a flat toll using TOLL BY PLATE (which uses automatic license plate recognition to take a photo of the vehicle's license plate and mail a bill <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> owner) or E-ZPass at highway speeds. There is no toll between Gateway and Warrendale and between Neshaminy Falls and the Delaware River Bridge. The PA29 interchange and the westbound Virginia Drive and eastbound Street Road interchanges only accept E-ZPass.|$|E
