5|$|According to this Upanishad, the renouncer pilgrim {{undertakes}} {{the journey}} to the knowledge of Brahman with purity of thought, without belongings, with his head shaved, wearing discoloured garments, free from enmity towards all, and he lives on alms. This method is not essential for anyone <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> or in mortal danger – such a person may renounce verbally or mentally.|$|E
5|$|After Cerezeda took {{most of the}} {{inhabitants}} of Trujillo into Higueras, the city entered a period of serious decline. Those inhabitants that remained were too old, <b>too</b> <b>sick,</b> or too dispirited to head west. Basic supplies such as food and clothing were scarce. The citizens believed that Cerezeda wished to abandon Trujillo, and appealed to the audiencia of Santo Domingo, and to the Crown, for supplies and a Crown-appointed governor.|$|E
5|$|Before the film's {{worldwide}} release date, Pixar {{granted a}} wish from 10-year-old Colby Curtin {{to see the}} film before she died. Colby {{had been diagnosed with}} cancer and was <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> to go to a theater. A Pixar employee flew to the Curtins' house with a DVD of the finished film and screened it for her and her family. Curtin died seven hours later at 9:20 pm, shortly after seeing the film.|$|E

60|$|When Mrs. Hart asked Corona {{to go in}} and see Jacky, Frances went <b>too.</b> The <b>sick</b> boy, a {{child with}} a delicate, wasted face and large, bright eyes, lay in a tiny bedroom off the kitchen. The air was hot and heavy. Mrs. Hart stood {{at the foot of the}} bed with her tragic face.|$|R
5|$|Though Endeavour {{was now in}} good condition, {{her crew}} were not. During the ship's stay in Batavia, all but 10 of the 94people aboard had been taken ill with malaria and dysentery. By the time Endeavour set sail on 26 December, seven crew members had died and another forty were <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> to attend their duties. Over the {{following}} twelve weeks, a further 23 died from disease and were buried at sea, including Spöring, Green, Parkinson, and the ship's surgeon William Monkhouse.|$|E
5|$|Later, Weed {{encounters}} a dog named Yukimura, and learns {{that a group}} of monkeys have been terrorizing the area. Leading them is Shōgun, a vicious baboon that feeds on young monkeys and puppies. Shōgun had previously attacked Yukimura and his family, permanently damaging his adopted father Saheiji. Weed, his comrades, Yukimura, and several rebellious monkeys attack Shōgun and his followers. Yukimura is able to injure Shōgun enough to ensure his death, but dies in the process. Saheiji reveals that Yukimura was Weed's brother: Sakura, <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> to care for all of her children, had given two of her puppies to Saheiji to raise as foster sons.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the KGB general {{set up by}} Koskov was to be General Gogol; however, Walter Gotell was <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> {{to handle}} the major role, and the {{character}} of Leonid Pushkin replaced Gogol, who appears briefly {{at the end of}} the film, having transferred to the Soviet diplomatic service. This was Gogol's final appearance in a James Bond film. Morten Harket, the lead vocalist of the Norwegian rock group A-ha (which performed the film's title song), was offered a small role as a villain's henchman in the film, but declined, because of lack of time and because he felt they wanted to cast him due to his popularity rather than his acting.|$|E

25|$|In February 1943, {{approximately}} 10,000 Białystok Jews were {{deported to}} the Treblinka extermination camp. During the deportations, hundreds of Jews, mainly those deemed <b>too</b> weak or <b>sick</b> to travel, were killed.|$|R
5|$|Parker was at {{home when}} the August 1896 term began, <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> to preside over the court, as he {{suffered}} from Bright's disease. The jurisdiction of the court {{came to an end}} on September 1, 1896, over lands in the Indian Territory; reporters wanted to interview him about his career but had to talk to him at his bedside. Parker died on November 17, 1896, of a number of health conditions, including heart degeneration and Bright's disease. His funeral in Fort Smith had the highest number of attenders up to that point. He is buried at the Fort Smith National Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The Upanishad {{asserts that}} anyone can renounce – this choice is entirely up to the individual, {{regardless}} of which Ashrama (stage of life) he is in. The Jabala Upanishad seems to justify suicide as an individual choice in certain circumstances, a view opposed by earlier Vedic texts and Principal Upanishads. Those <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> may renounce the worldly life in their mind. The Jabala Upanishad presents the Vedanta philosophy view that one who truly renounces lives an ethical life, which includes not injuring anyone in thought, word or deed. Such a sannyasi (renunciate) abandons all rituals, is without attachments to anything or anyone, and is one who {{is devoted to the}} oneness of Atman and Brahman.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Sylvester's boyfriend, Rick Cranmer, {{became aware}} that he had become {{infected}} with HIV; with no known medical cure, his health deteriorated rapidly and he died in September 1987. Sylvester was devastated, and although recognizing that he too was probably infected, he refused to have his blood tested, only noticing the virus's first symptoms when he developed a persistent cough. Beginning work on an album that would remain unfinished, he {{moved into a new}} apartment on Collingwood Street in the Castro, and tried his best to continue performing in the Bay Area, even though he became <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> to undertake a full tour. Eventually diagnosed with AIDS, he was hospitalized for sinus surgery in late 1987, and upon returning to his apartment he began to be cared for by his mother and Tracy, before being hospitalized again in May 1988, this time with pneumocystis pneumonia. Returning to his flat, he gave away many of his treasured possessions and wrote his will.|$|E

5000|$|In Cyprus {{there were}} <b>too</b> many <b>sick</b> people {{due to the}} {{frequent}} malaria epidemics, and too few doctors. Qualified doctors were working well and paid well. In addition, doctors were selling drugs for extra income. The first doctor of that period was Aloise Cucci (1625). He was an Italian who lived in Cyprus, a well-informed and wise doctor. There were many others mentioned by name, both Cypriot and French. Examples are: ...|$|R
5|$|Miles of Plancy briefly {{held the}} regency for the underaged Baldwin IV. Miles {{was assassinated in}} October 1174, and Raymond III was soon {{appointed}} to replace him. Raymond named William chancellor of Jerusalem, as well as archdeacon of Nazareth, and on 6 June 1175, William was elected archbishop of Tyre to replace Frederick de la Roche, {{who had died in}} October 1174. William's duties as chancellor probably did not take up too much of his time; the scribes and officials in the chancery drafted documents and it may not have even been necessary for him to be present to sign them. Instead he focused on his duties as archbishop. In 1177 he performed the funeral services for William of Montferrat, husband of Baldwin IV's sister Sibylla, when the patriarch of Jerusalem, Amalric of Nesle, was <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> to attend.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific weather proved {{favourable}} but by August the {{two ships}} had {{lost sight of}} each other and continued their voyage separately. On 23 August Prince of Wales rounded Cape Horn alone and headed northeast and north on a path to Rio. Throughout the voyage her crew had been heavily reliant on a diet of salted meat and by early September scurvy had incapacitated the majority. Mason died from the condition on 9 October, and another 13 men were too ill to leave their bunks. When Rio was finally sighted on 13 October the crew were <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> to bring the ship to port. She drifted helplessly in the outer harbor until Rio's harbourmaster sighted her the following morning and had additional seamen rowed out to assist. Twelve of Prince of Wales sickest crew members were hospitalised in Rio while the remainder recovered on board.|$|E
5|$|Continuing north, {{they soon}} {{run out of}} gas, but receive help from the Aurora Boreanaz, who instructs them to stay at a nearby cabin. The two survive {{the night in the}} cabin and set out on foot the next morning. They finally make it to Santa's workshop, only to find a dark, gloomy factory in a dreary, polluted, lifeless wasteland; Santa a sickly and {{depressed}} old man, the elves all horribly mutated and inbred due to Santa's attempts {{to keep up with the}} increasing gift demands year after year, and the reindeer carnivorous, feral monsters that eat the elves who wander out into the snow to die of exhaustion. Santa suddenly collapses and is <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> to deliver the presents. Brian and Stewie agree to do it, but end up wasting an hour and a half at their first house after the family discover their presence, before discovering they were in the wrong house. Realizing that they will not be able to complete the delivery in time, and understanding firsthand the impossibility of Santa's job, Stewie and Brian abandon the delivery in lieu of another plan.|$|E
6000|$|The first {{lieutenant}} {{mentioned the}} matter to the captain, who at once embraced the offer, for he, <b>too,</b> was <b>sick</b> of the work, in which no honour was to be obtained, and in which the risks were great, as the coast was a dangerous one. He sent for Will and said: “I hear, Mr. Gilmore, that {{you are willing to}} volunteer to land and gain information. Have you considered the risks?” ...|$|R

25|$|During the week, ITV were {{uncertain}} if Vickers {{would be}} able to perform due to her continued illness, and raised the question of whether she should be given another week off if she was still <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> to sing. It was, however, later confirmed that she would appear.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of the battle 4,035 British were listed sick, a few hundred of these were <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> to embark and were left behind. Two more {{transports}} were lost with about 300 troops mostly from the King's German Legion. By the time the army returned to England four days later some 6,000 were ill, with the sick returns listed at Portsmouth and Plymouth alone as 5,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} was to secure the cura of a medicus. If the patient was <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> to move one sent for a clinicus, who went to the clinum or couch of the patient. Of higher status were the chirurgii (which became the English word surgeon), from Greek cheir (hand) and ourgon (work). In {{addition}} were the eye doctor, ocularius, the ear doctor, auricularius, and the doctor of snakebites, the marsus.|$|E
30|$|Conclusion Fourteen {{percent of}} {{patients}} considered for ICU admission are refused, and the ratio <b>too</b> well/too <b>sick</b> to benefit of 1.4 suggests an early referral practice in these patients. The reasons for refusal, e.g., performance status and quality of life, remain unchanged during the last decade. The decision of non-admission of a patient with hematological malignancy in the ICU is made consensually by participating physicians and is taken comfortably {{in the majority of}} cases.|$|R
50|$|Majority of {{the males}} (62.02%) falling under working age {{population}} were employed while only a little over 10% of the females were employed. Out of the municipality’s labor force, majority (52.54%) were not economically active who were either <b>too</b> old, <b>sick,</b> or still at school age. Overall, the total employment rate in Castilla was only 40.95% while unemployment was recorded at 6.50%. This is expected considering that there is inadequate employment opportunity in the municipality.|$|R

25|$|Grant's force then {{proceeded}} to burn the fifteen Middle Towns and all the crops. Grant expressly ordered the troops to summarily execute any Indian man, woman or child they captured. Although, by July, Grant had marched his men to exhaustion with 300 <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> to walk, he had wrecked the Cherokee economy and made 4,000 inhabitants of the Middle Towns homeless and starving. In August 1761 the Cherokee sued for peace.|$|E
25|$|Conditions {{were so bad}} at Flößberg, {{that the}} commandant told the SS to make some improvements, not because {{of concern for the}} prisoners' welfare, but because missile {{production}} and therefore, the war effort, would be negatively affected. One of Kotkowsky's friends found the conditions so unbearable, he took the opportunity to be returned to Buchenwald with a transport of prisoners <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> to work, betting his chances of survival against the odds.|$|E
25|$|Ruby Bates was {{apparently}} <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> to travel. She had had surgery in New York, {{and at one}} point Leibowitz requested that her deposition be taken as a dying declaration. While she was not dying, committed to his three-day time limit for the trial, Judge Callahan denied the request to arrange to take her deposition. Although the defense needed her testimony, by the time a deposition arrived, the case had gone to the jury and they did not hear it at all.|$|E
