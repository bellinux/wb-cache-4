40|$|The {{observed}} boron/beryllium {{ratio in}} extreme Population II stars {{has been interpreted}} as evidence of Be and B synthesis by early Galactic cosmic rays. However, a recent reanalysis of the boron abundance in the Population II halo star HD 140823 suggests that B/H may be larger than previously reported, {{by as much as}} a factor of 4. This would yield a B/Be ratio lying in the range 14 less <b>than</b> <b>or</b> approximately <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> B/Be less <b>than</b> <b>or</b> approximately <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 50. The possibilty of a high Population II B/Be ratio stresses the importance of the upper limit to the B/Be ratio arising from cosmic-ray production. It is found that the limit to cosmic-ray-produced B/Be depends upon the assumed cosmic-ray spectrum. For any Population II cosmic-ray spectrum that is a single power law in either total energy per nucleon or in momentum, the B/Be ratio constrained to lie in the range 7. 6 less <b>than</b> <b>or</b> approximately <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> B/Be less <b>than</b> <b>or</b> approximately <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 14.

Finally, it is noted that the boron reanalysis highlights the uncertainty in our knowledge of the B/Be ratio, and the need for additional data on Be and B abundances...|$|R

For those with PVE done, only the pre-PVE volume was considered for analysis. 204 patients are recruited in the study, all patients with HCC who had volumetry done before hepactectomy. Results: None of the patients with preoperative sFLR less <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equals</b> <b>to</b> 25 % has multi-organ failure while there are 4 % and 3. 6 % patients with preoperative sFLR from 25. 1 % to 35 % and more than 35 % respectively have multi-organ failure. 11. 8 %, 1. 3 % and 4. 5 % patients with preoperative sFLR less <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equals</b> <b>to</b> 25 %, from 25. 1 % to 35 % and more than 35 % respectively died during the stay in the hospital after the operation.
