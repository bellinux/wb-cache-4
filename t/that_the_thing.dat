5|$|Mulder and Scully {{go to the}} Shipley {{house and}} find the {{bathroom}} door barricaded shut, no sign of any people. The two have a brief run-in with Deputy Greer who believes they are burglars until Mulder disarms the man and Scully shows him her FBI ID. They attempt {{to go to the}} airport but are trapped by the hurricane. Elsewhere at the Breakers Condominiums, Deputy Greer encounters the creature after finding a dead man covered in a slimy substance on a toilet. Mulder and Scully later find the deputy's vehicle parked outside the apartments. Searching the building, they discover Greer on the ground, his neck covered with red welts. Mulder goes around the complex to find {{the rest of the people}} and warn them <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> is in the plumbing. He encounters Dougie, a looter, Walter Suarez whose girlfriend Angela Villareal is nine months pregnant, and George Vincent, an anti-government Second Amendment activist. Mulder attempts to get Vincent to come out and join them for his own protection. Vincent refuses but, after being attacked by the creature in his apartment, relents. Mulder hypothesizes that the entity attacking them was driven from the bottom of the sea by the hurricane into the city's water system.|$|E

In addition, korbanot have no expiating effect unless the person making the offering sincerely repents his or her actions before making the offering, and makes restitution to any person who was harmed by the violation. The Book of Ezekiel states that the Messiah to come will still bring sin offerings for unintentional sins in the Third Jerusalem Temple, implying it could be korbanot or prayers.|$|E
25|$|Leaving Childs on guard, {{the others}} {{head out to}} test Blair, {{only to find that}} he has {{tunneled}} out of the tool shed. They realize that Blair is assimilated and has been scavenging equipment to build a small escape craft. Discovering that Childs is missing and the station's power generator is destroyed, MacReady speculates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Thing</b> now intends to hibernate until a rescue team arrives. MacReady, Garry, and Nauls decide to dynamite the complex, hoping to destroy the Thing. As they set the explosives, Blair kills Garry and Nauls disappears. Blair transforms into a much larger monster and attacks, destroying the detonator, but MacReady still triggers the blast with a stick of dynamite, destroying the base.|$|E

500|$|En Esch, {{one of the}} {{longtime}} core members of KMFDM, had almost {{nothing to do with}} Xtort, contributing to just two songs. With regard to Esch's lack of participation, Konietzko said, [...] "En Esch is just En Esch. He never made himself available to do this album, and so it's always my belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> must keep moving; I had to do it without him." [...] He also said the two were not in communication {{around the time of the}} album's release.|$|E
500|$|Starkey {{was fascinated}} by King Henry VIII, and his thesis focused on the Tudor monarch's inner household. His {{doctoral}} supervisor was Sir Geoffrey Elton, {{an expert on the}} Tudor period. Starkey claimed that with age his mentor became [...] "tetchy" [...] and [...] "arrogant". In 1983, when Elton was awarded a knighthood, Starkey derided one of his essays, Cromwell Redivivus and Elton responded by writing an [...] "absolutely shocking" [...] review of a collection of essays Starkey had edited. Starkey later expressed his remorse over the spat: [...] "I regret <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> happened at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Writers for Famitsu {{called the}} game [...] "super-simple", {{comparing}} it to Metro-Cross and Paperboy, and calling it a simplified version of Crash Bandicoot. Others have made similar comments. A reviewer for IGN also compared it to Crash Bandicoot, described the gameplay as [...] "simplistic [...] rote memorization based", and said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> the game would be remembered for was its [...] "extremely bizarre premise". They still felt that the game was not bad, {{and that it was}} worth the price, which they noted was low. James Mielke at GameSpot called the game a [...] "nifty little distraction", and said that the gameplay was similar to the [...] "old-school gaming dynamics of yesteryear". He commented on the low price, but said that it was difficult to find imports of it.|$|E

500|$|Author and {{journalist}} Heidi Stringell finds Flagg [...] "an embodiment of pure evil", contending that King sees {{good and evil}} as “real forces”; Flagg’s embodiment of evil is confirmed {{by the fact that}} [...] "he is a killer, a maker of mischief, a liar, and a tempter". To Stringell, Flagg’s disappearance at the end of The Stand shows that “evil ultimately leads nowhere”. The author calls Flagg a [...] "generic hybrid" [...] of the archetypical [...] "Dark Man and the Trickster". To her, the combination of these two characteristics found in different cultural realms forces people to face their [...] "flawed humanity" [...] with the [...] "amorality” Flagg represents. Jenifer Paquette, author of Respecting The Stand: A Critical Analysis of Stephen King's Apocalyptic Novel, writes that [...] "Flagg's horror is that he looks like an ordinary man, and his behavior is a mockery of humanity—a terrible insight into the human psyche. King suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> to fear the most is inside ourselves." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Imprisoned {{with the}} Pharaohs" [...] {{has been cited}} as an early {{influence}} on Robert Bloch, which is particularly evident in his tale [...] "Fane of the Black Pharaoh". Although Lovecraft himself refers to the real sphinx as a god of the dead, Bloch expanded upon the mythos and claimed that the sphinx in [...] "Imprisoned with the Pharaohs" [...] was actually Nyarlathotep, an Outer God and Lovecraft creation. The idea of a twist ending, where a terrible discovery is made worse by the realization {{that it is only}} part of a larger horror, was used again in [...] "The Shunned House", written later that year. In this tale, the protagonist digs into the cellar of the eponymous dwelling only to find <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> he believed to be the monster of the tale is only the beast's elbow. The text of [...] "Imprisoned with the Pharaohs", like many of Lovecraft's works, is in the public domain and can be found in several compilations of the author's work {{as well as on the}} Internet.|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 985 feet long, {{was released}} on June 24, 1910. Advertisements played up {{the wreck of the}} $40,000 train car while a positive review in The Moving Picture World praised the well-managed production's prison and track wreck scenes, but remarked that the improbable story was purely fantastical. One of the more dramatic articles to appear in The Moving Picture World included reference to the film while playing up the dramatic element describe the footage and the filming of the wreck. It states: [...] "... The scenes were portrayals of a train crash and they give you startling before-and-after wreck views. They made you shiver when they showed you the fate that came to a car full of passengers - sudden, cruel and without warning. They made you shiver; ... And you thanked God <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> before you was only a picture on the screen!" [...] Known advertisements for the film included theaters in Rhode Island and Indiana. Records show that film made it to Australia, with one Launceston, Tasmania newspaper showing an advertisement on January 30, 1911.|$|E

Her dancers conglomerate around her near the end and Gaga reveals herself to be covered with blood. She then states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> she hates more than money is the truth and performs [...] "Teeth", while introducing her band. Gaga and her friends then find the Eternal Fountain, which pours out red colored liquid and Gaga explains that it bleeds for anyone. She starts singing [...] "Alejandro" [...] while jumping into the fountain and singing, as blood pours over her. Gaga then returns and sings [...] "Poker Face" [...] on the cat-walk. After the performance, she and her friends find themselves in a dark place, and after some dialogue, Gaga's friends run off, leaving her alone to deal with the Fame Monster, a giant angler fish. Gaga starts singing [...] "Paparazzi" [...] and eventually kills the Fame Monster by shooting sparks from her pyrotechnic bra and underwear. She then leaves for the Monster Ball and after appearing there, meanwhile fans assume the show is over, suddenly Gaga appears on stage and [...] performs the final song, [...] "Bad Romance" [...] while standing inside a giant gyroscope.|$|E
500|$|The 2003-04 {{comic book}} miniseries Wanted, by Mark Millar and J. G. Jones, {{came to the}} {{attention}} of [...] Universal Pictures through executive Jeff Kirschenbaum, a comic book fan who sought a film adaptation that would be considered a [...] "hard-R" [...] and encouraged the studio to pick up the rights to the miniseries. By 2004, producer Marc Platt had gotten the film rights, and lobbied the studio to get Russian-Kazakh director Timur Bekmambetov, as Platt considered that the visual style and sensibility Bekmambetov showed in Night Watch and Day Watch [...] fit Wanted as “the comic is dark and edgy but it also has an ironic, comedic tone beneath its violent action”. In December 2005, Bekmambetov was hired to helm the project, his first English-language film, and writers Derek Haas and Michael Brandt were assigned the script. Bekmambetov described the original comic as [...] "risky and very provocative", with [...] "a twist and good characters", and declared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that attracted him the most in Wanted was how it went through various film genres in its plot: [...] "It’s a comedy, a tragedy, a drama, a melodrama. Every scene, we change genres and that’s why our movie is different.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Certain {{forms of}} dualism make the {{assertion}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> worshiped as God {{in this world}} is actually an evil impostor, but that a true benevolent deity worthy of being called [...] "God" [...] exists beyond this world. Thus, the Gnostics (see Sethian, Ophites) believed that God (the deity worshiped by Jews, Greek Pagan philosophers and Christians) was really an evil creator or demiurge that stood between us and some greater, more truly benevolent real deity. Similarly, Marcionites depicted God as represented in the Old Testament as a wrathful, malicious demiurge.|$|E

[...] "I think that we're taking it on, to another place. I think that's really important," [...] Cherry said.

2500|$|Troubled by new acts he {{felt were}} imitating Radiohead, Yorke {{believed}} his music had {{become part of}} a constant background noise he described as [...] "fridge buzz", and became hostile to the music media.

2500|$|The 'two-world' {{interpretation}} regards Kant's {{position as}} a statement of epistemological limitation, {{that we are not}} able to transcend the bounds of our own mind, meaning that we cannot access the [...] "thing-in-itself". However, Kant also speaks of the thing in itself or transcendental object as a product of the (human) understanding as it attempts to conceive of objects in abstraction from the conditions of sensibility. Following this line of thought, some interpreters have argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> in itself does not represent a separate ontological domain but simply a way of considering objects by means of the understanding alonethis is known as the two-aspect view.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 February 1801 Fitzwilliam moved an {{amendment}} in the Lords, {{the same as}} Grey was introducing into the Commons.

But he must own <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> was hopeless. ... France was now, in fact, established into a monarchy under republican forms. ... The die was cast—he must submit". Fitzwilliam had now rejoined the Foxite opposition after six years of independence, and the only issue that separated him from them was parliamentary reform.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{documentary}} Terror Takes Shape on the DVD, film editor Todd C.

Carpenter agreed and shot {{a scene in which}} MacReady has been rescued and administered a blood test, proving that he is still human. Ramsay follows this by saying <b>that</b> <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> had two test screenings, but Carpenter did not use the sequence in either of them, as the director felt that the film worked better with its eventual nihilistic conclusion. The alternate ending with MacReady definitively proven to be human has yet to be released.|$|E
