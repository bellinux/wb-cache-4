In 2009 he was featured in a documentary directed by Harry Hunkele called <b>Back</b> <b>Door</b> Channels: The Price of Peace. <b>Back</b> <b>Door</b> <b>Channels</b> {{takes its name from}} the important yet seldom understood role that unofficial back channels of communications, often through third-party countries and private businessmen, played in securing the peace between Israel and Egypt. In addition, the film’s producers conducted in-depth interviews with many of the original participants from the first historic peace process, including former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and other world leaders.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe <b>back</b> <b>door</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} to be an exit pathway from the myosin active site for phosphate (Pi) generated by adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate hydrolysis. We used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interaction of Pi with the <b>back</b> <b>door</b> and the plausibility of Pi release via this route. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the Dictyostelium motor domain with bound Mg·adenosine 5 ′-diphosphate (ADP) and Pi, modeled upon the Mg·ADP·BeFx and Mg·ADP·Vi structures. Simulations revealed that the relaxation of ADP and free Pi from their initial positions reduced {{the diameter of the}} <b>back</b> <b>door</b> via motions of switch 1 and switch 2 located in the upper and lower 50 -kDa subdomains, respectively. In neither simulation could Pi freely diffuse out the <b>back</b> <b>door.</b> Water molecules, however, could flux through the <b>back</b> <b>door</b> in the Mg·ADP·BeFx-based simulation but not in the Mg·ADP·Vi-based simulation. In neither structure was water observed fluxing through the main (front door) entrance. These observations suggest that the ability of Pi to leave via the <b>back</b> <b>door</b> is linked tightly to conformational changes between the upper and lower 50 -kDa subdomains. The simulations offer structural explanations for 18 O-exchange with Pi at the active site, and Pi release being the rate-limiting step in the myosin adenosine 5 ′-triphosphatase...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{indicate that}} hydrocarbon migration and entrapment in stacked fault-bounded reservoirs are mainly {{affected by the}} following factors: charge time, faults, pressure and geological structures. The charge time for commercial hydrocarbon accumulation is much longer in oil-water systems than in oil-gas-water systems. Faults are classified into charging faults and 'back doors' faults other than charging faults in stacked fault-bounded reservoirs. The lower the displacement pressure of a fault, the higher its updip oil transportation ability. The downdip oil transportation ability of a fault is usually low and cannot cause commercial downdip oil accumulation. <b>Back</b> <b>doors</b> affect both hydrocarbon percent charge and hydrocarbon migration pathways. Updip <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> improve updip oil charge. The lower the displacement pressure of an updip <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> the more efficient the updip oil charge before 3, 000 years. <b>Back</b> <b>doors</b> whose displacement pressure is equal to or higher than 28. 76 psi are effective in sealing faults in oil-water systems. On the contrary, only sealing faults result in commercial gas accumulations in stacked fault-compartmentalized reservoirs. Otherwise gas is found over oil. Downdip <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> generally have few effects on downdip hydrocarbon charge. Geopressure enhances the updip oil transportation of a fault and improves {{the positive effects of}} updip <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> during updip oil charge. Geopressure and updip <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> result in more efficient updip oil charge. A physical barrier is not necessarily a barrier to oil migration with the aid of geopressure and updip <b>back</b> <b>doors.</b> The chance for hydrocarbon charge into reservoirs along growth faults is not equal. Any one of the above controlling factors can change the patterns of hydrocarbon charge and distribution in such complex geological structures. Generally, lower reservoirs and updip reservoirs are favored. Reservoirs along low-permeability charging faults may be bypassed. Gas can only charge the updip reservoirs. Both updip and downdip <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> can facilitate oil penetrating a barrier fault to charge reservoirs offset by the barrier fault. Interreservoir migration among stacked fault-compartmentalized reservoirs is an important mechanism for hydrocarbon accumulation and trap identification. The interreservoir migration is a very slow process, even though the displacement pressures of bounding faults may be very low...|$|R
