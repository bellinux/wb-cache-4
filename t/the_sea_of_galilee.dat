Meanwhile, Syrian aircraft made bombing runs on Masada, Sha'ar HaGolan, Degania Bet and Afikim. The attack on Samakh (Tzemah) resumed before dawn on May 17—the Syrians attacked the village's northern positions, but their armor stayed behind. The infantry thus could not advance into the concentrated Israeli fire from the village itself, despite severe ammunition shortages on the Israeli side.|$|R

40|$|Wetland {{management}} {{usually involves}} multiple stakeholders. This paper {{describes how the}} use of the ecosystem services (ES) concept can help to identify the main stakeholders associated with wetland conservation, using the Hula Wetland in <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee’s</b> watershed as a case study. We conducted a stakeholder analysis based on semi-structured interviews. We focused on the management of two semi-natural areas within the larger Hula Wetland area (Hula Nature Reserve and Agamon), in which different management regimes are used and which provide different bundles of ES to different stakeholders. Using the ES concept in the stakeholder analysis, we were able to present the Hula Wetland management in a comprehensive manner. The approach also revealed a lack of coordination between the managing organisations which might lead to competition favouring cultural services (in particular tourism) at the expense of habitat services (i. e. biodiversity conservation) in the future. To test our method we also conducted a stakeholder analysis in the Camargue Wetland in France. The two wetlands have similar characteristics but are embedded in different institutional contexts. The Camargue Regional Park has a multi-stakeholder platform which could serve as an example for the Hula Wetland to improve its management and lead to better coordination and complementarity of ES provided by the two sub-sites. Our study showed that applying the ES concept helps to quickly identify relevant stakeholders and analyse wetland management in a more holistic way and to point towards sustainable solutions for conflicting stakeholder interests...|$|R

5000|$|An earlier water {{development}} scheme was proposed by Walter C. Lowdermilk {{in his book}} Palestine, Land of Promise, published in 1944; it was developed with human and financial assistance from the American Zionist Emergency Council. The book became a bestseller, and important in swaying the debate within the Truman administration concerning immigrant absorptive capacity and the Negev as part of Israel. His book served {{as the basis for}} a detailed water resource plan which was prepared by James Hayes, an engineer from the USA, who proposed utilizing all water sources in Israel (2 km³ per annum) for irrigation and the production of electricity. This would involve diverting part of the Litani River water to the Hasbani River. This water which would be further transported by a dam and canal to the area south of Tel Hai, from where it would be [...] "dropped" [...] to produce electricity. Water would also be carried from Tel Hai to the Beit Netofa Valley which would become a national water reservoir, of about one billion cu.m. volume (one quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee's</b> volume). An electricity generating station would be located at the reservoir's outlet, from where the water would flow into an open canal to Rafiah, which, whilst travelling south would collect water from wadis and streams, including the waters of the Yarkon River. Hayes also asserted that the Yarmouk River would be channeled into Lake Kinneret, in order to prevent a rise in its salinity which could come about {{as a result of the}} diversion of the River Jordan, and that a joint Israeli-Jordanian dam about 5 km east of kibbutz Sha'ar HaGolan would be constructed. The Hayes plan was designed to be implemented in two stages over a 10-year period, but never materialised due to its economic infeasibility and lack of cooperation by Jordan.|$|R

He was one of only three Easterners to be made emperor before the decisive separation of East and West in 395. (The other two were Elagabalus and Alexander Severus). Even among Easterners Philip was atypical, as he was an Arab, not a Greek. His father was Julius Marinus; nothing besides his name is known, but the name indicates that he held Roman citizenship and that he must have been prominent in his community.|$|E

The Syrians were not intending to carry out any further operation south of <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee</b> and planned to make their main effort further north, near the Bnot Ya'akov bridge. On May 19, the Iraqis were about to drive west through Nablus toward Tulkarm, and asked the Syrians to make a diversion in the Degania area to protect their right flank. The Syrians complied, their main objective being to seize the bridge across the river north of Degania Alef, thus blocking any Israeli attack from Tiberias against the Iraqi line of communications.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Exploitation of {{freshwater}} resources is having catastrophic {{effects on the}} ecological dynamics, stability, and quality of those water resources on a global scale, especially in arid and semiarid regions. Lake Kinneret, Israel (<b>the</b> Biblical <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee),</b> <b>the</b> only major natural freshwater lake in the Middle East, has been transformed functionally into a reservoir over the course of; 70 years of hydrological alterations aimed mostly at producing electrical power and increasing domestic and agricultural water supply. Historical changes in lake chemistry and biology were reconstructed using analysis of sedimentary nutrient content, stable and radioisotope composition, biochemical and morphological fossils from algae, remains of aquatic invertebrates, and chemical indices of past light regimes. Together, these paleolimnological analyses of the lake’s bottom sediments revealed that this transformation {{has been accompanied by}} acceleration in the rate of eutrophication, as indicated by increased accumulation rates of phosphorus, nitrogen, organic matter, phytoplankton and bacterial pigments, and remains of phytoplankton and zooplankton. Substantial increases in these indices of eutrophication coincide with periods of increased water-level fluctuations and drainage of a major upstream wetland in the early to middle 20 th century and suggest tha...|$|R
25|$|As {{lord of the}} region, Raymond was {{appointed}} to guide the army across Galilee. After Saladin's troops started attacking the Templars at the rear, the crusaders halted at Maskana, although the local well could not provide enough water to a large army. Ernoul blamed Raymond for this decision, but the anonymous author of the Libellus de expugnatione Terrae Sanctae per Saladinum, who also participated in the campaign, stated that the king decided to stop, ignoring Raymond's advice. Saladin's troops encircled the crusaders' camp and killed all crusaders who left it in searh for water. The following day the army continued the march towards Tiberias, with Raymond commanding the vanguard, but Saladin's troops were continuously attacking them. Suffering from thirst, a group of foot soldiers tried {{to break through the}} enemy lines towards <b>the</b> distant <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee,</b> but they were massacred. Five of Raymond's own knights voluntarily defected to Saladin's side. In an attempt to reach the springs near Hattin, Raymond led a cavalry charge against the right wing of Saladin's army, forcing the Muslim troops to open a free pass without resistance. Instead of turning back, Raymond and the crusaders who had accompanied him (including Reynald of Sidon, Balian of Ibelin and Joscelin III of Edessa) hurried first to Safed, and later to Tyre.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> celebrated <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee</b> is not {{so large}} a sea as Lake Tahoe --[I measure all lakes by Tahoe, partly because I am far more {{familiar}} with it than with any other, and partly because I have such a high admiration for it and such a world of pleasant recollections of it, {{that it is very}} nearly impossible for me to speak of lakes and not mention it.]--by a good deal--it is just about two-thirds as large. And when we come to speak <b>of</b> beauty, this <b>sea</b> is no more to be compared to Tahoe than a meridian of longitude is to a rainbow. The dim waters of this pool can not suggest the limpid brilliancy of Tahoe; these low, shaven, yellow hillocks of rocks and sand, so devoid of perspective, can not suggest the grand peaks that compass Tahoe like a wall, and whose ribbed and chasmed fronts are clad with stately pines that seem to grow small and smaller as they climb, till one might fancy them reduced to weeds and shrubs far upward, where they join the everlasting snows. Silence and solitude brood over Tahoe; and silence and solitude brood also over this lake of Genessaret. But the solitude of the one is as cheerful and fascinating as the solitude of the other is dismal and repellant.|$|R

50|$|The Miraculous Draft of Fishes is a 1444 oil on wood panel {{painting}} by the Swabian artist Konrad Witz, {{on view in}} the Museum of Art and History (Musée d'Art et d'Histoire) in Geneva, Switzerland. Originally part of a now dismantled altarpiece known as Peter's Altar Table, the panel depicts the miraculous catch of 153 fish {{as reported in the}} Gospel of John and shows a scene of the disciples, who had been fishing {{at the edge of a}} lake, recognising the stranger who had called out to them from the shore as the resurrected Jesus. Peter is shown wading toward Jesus to greet him. In this painting Witz takes the revolutionary step of moving the scene from <b>the</b> biblical <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee</b> to his local area, around Lake Geneva. With this move, Witz was able to base his rendering of the far landscape on his own observation of actual topographical features rather than rely on imaginative interpretation as earlier artists did. He further brought the landscape to the fore of his work; here the range is not simply a footnote seen through a window or detail visible beyond a crucifixion scene. The painting is renowned for its naturalistic representation of the Graian Alps and the snow-capped peaks of Mont Blanc and Le Môle seen in the distance. In this regard the work is the earliest known faithful portrayal of a landscape in European art history.|$|R

Nazareth is forlorn; about that ford of Jordan where the hosts of Israel entered the Promised Land with songs of rejoicing, one finds only a squalid camp of fantastic Bedouins of the desert; Jericho the accursed, lies a moldering ruin, to-day, even as Joshua's miracle left it more than three thousand years ago; Bethlehem and Bethany, in their poverty and their humiliation, have nothing about them now to remind one that they once knew the high honor of the Saviour's presence; the hallowed spot where the shepherds watched their flocks by night, and where the angels sang Peace on earth, good will to men, is untenanted by any living creature, and unblessed by any feature that is pleasant to the eye. Renowned Jerusalem itself, the stateliest name in history, has lost all its ancient grandeur, and is become a pauper village; the riches of Solomon are no longer there to compel the admiration of visiting Oriental queens; the wonderful temple which was the pride and the glory of Israel, is gone, and the Ottoman crescent is lifted above the spot where, on that most memorable day {{in the annals of}} the world, they reared the Holy Cross. <b>The</b> noted <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee,</b> where Roman fleets once rode at anchor and the disciples of the Saviour sailed in their ships, was long ago deserted by the devotees of war and commerce, and its borders are a silent wilderness; Capernaum is a shapeless ruin; Magdala is the home of beggared Arabs; Bethsaida and Chorazin have vanished from the earth, and the [...] "desert places" [...] round about them where thousands of men once listened to the Saviour's voice and ate the miraculous bread, sleep in the hush of a solitude that is inhabited only by birds of prey and skulking foxes.|$|R
