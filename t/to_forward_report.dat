50|$|In July, Hollis {{traveled}} to Europe, opened the Geneva office, {{and began the}} ICTN newsletter. But soon he realized the negotiations themselves were stalling due to agricultural inertia and European concern that President Ford might not be elected in the Watergate backlash the following year. The Europeans decided on a “wait-and-see” posture, effectively postponing any meaningful talks. Hollis recognized the ICTN could not maintain momentum and its budget commitments {{in such an environment}} and returned stateside after arranging for a freelance journalist, accredited before the Palais des Nations (United Nations) for press briefings <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>reports</b> <b>to</b> ICTN subscribers.|$|R

President Bush issued an additional amendment to Executive Order 13183 on December 3, 2003 with Executive Order 13319, which established the Task Force co-chairs and instructed the Task Force to issue reports as needed, but no less than once every two years.

[...] The Times also notes that the film helped spur the House Armed Services Committee to hold a January 23, 2013 hearing on sexual assault in the military. [...] During the hearing, Rep. Mike Turner acknowledged the film for illustrating the hostility faced by many survivors who speak up or seek help. The Invisible War was again discussed during a Senate subcommittee hearing on March 13, 2013 in which lawmakers and military officials described the film's impact on military training programs dealing with sexual assault.|$|R

30|$|Corrupt {{policing}} {{practices were}} also {{cited as a}} challenge in policing wildland fires. Dube and Mafoko (2009) also echoed that it is partly because of corruption that the general public has grown to be reluctant <b>to</b> come <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> on who or what caused a fire. Some respondents would argue the some officers would receive bribes {{so that they can}} set perpetrators of wildland fires free, as a result it does not make a difference whether the case is reported or not. Lack of appropriate punishment has been attributed to increasing wildland fires (Nyamadzawo et al. 2013). Leaf (2002) also shared the same sentiments when he said the current Roman-Dutch system is increasingly believed to be excessively lenient and consequently ineffective at controlling wildland fire crimes because it provides insufficient deterrence against offending.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, Stuart's cavalry under Col.

At this time, McDowell received a report from his cavalry commander, Brig. Gen. John Buford, who reported that 17 regiments of infantry, one battery, and 500 cavalry were moving through Gainesville at 8:15 a.m. This was Longstreet's wing arriving from Thoroughfare Gap, and it warned the two Union generals that trouble lay to their front. The Union advance was again halted. For some reason, McDowell neglected <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> Buford's <b>report</b> <b>to</b> Pope until about 7 p.m., so the army commander was operating under two severe misconceptions: that Longstreet was not near the battlefield and that Porter and McDowell were marching to attack Jackson's right flank.|$|R
50|$|Yiliang (怡良), {{governor}} of the two provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang, was dispatched as commissioner to Taiwan after protest by British Plenipotentiary Henry Pottinger. After investigation, Yiliang reported that Ta-hung-a and Yao Ying confessed <b>to</b> <b>forwarding</b> false <b>reports.</b> In April 1843, they were recalled to the capital Beijing. After being interrogated, they were imprisoned but released by the emperor on 18 October, having served only 12 days. The emperor used his subordinates as scapegoats for his own ordering of the execution. Pottinger did not became aware of this deceit. On 16 December, Ta-hung-a was assigned to a post at Hami, Xinjiang province, while Yao Ying received an appointment in Sichuan province.

30|$|In [1], {{the authors}} {{proposed}} the LEACH algorithm {{to build a}} hierarchy tree. The LEACH algorithm has two phases. The setup phase will randomly select a local cluster head.

The LEACH algorithm concentrates only on finding an efficient way <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> the data <b>report</b> <b>to</b> the data center but does not construct robust and reliable reports in an energy efficient manner.|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{the ideas}} {{explored}} {{here can be}} applied to more general network symmetries: for example, a network with several excitatory clusters and global inhibition, or several weakly connected balanced networks [48]. This will both introduce realism and allow the exploration of whether there are some universal features that are implied by the broad features of realistic neural network symmetries such as cortex-like excitatory/inhibitory ratios, spatial range specificity of excitatory vs. inhibitory connections, and so forth. We look <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>reporting</b> on this in future work.|$|R
