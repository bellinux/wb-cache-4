25|$|Agentic-personal self principle: When identity-fused {{individuals}} become strongly {{aligned with}} a group, they {{are assumed to}} maintain an active and agentic personal self, even when the social self is activated. Consistent with this idea, activating the personal self by increasing physiological arousal, or encouraging people <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> they would react if they were personally threatened, may increase the person's endorsement of extreme pro-group sacrifices. In contrast, the social identification perspective assumes that the personal and social selves are hydraulically related to one another. As such, activating the personal self should diminish endorsement of pro-group behavior. However, {{this was not the}} case for strongly fused individuals, who actually demonstrated the exact opposite effect.|$|E
