25|$|Arthur Berry... was a {{good teacher}} and focus for art {{activity}} at the Burslem & Stoke Art School. I do not agree that he is for many the finest 20th century artist from Stoke - there are other candidates also. Mr Berry's work lies somewhere between painting and drawing - for me paint and its properties hold most attraction. Mr Berry's talent was spread over several areas - drawing, painting, writing, plays, poems and teaching. I do not think I am good enough myself to do several things well, so concentrate on one (painting). Mr Berry said he admired Lowry and once encountered him in a Manchester Gallery - said he was built and made for a particular task - as an artist recording the vanishing industrial scene of Manchester....Mr Berry was, I feel, a humorist whose interest was {{the people of the}} old working class of Stoke - a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> no longer exists. I mostly liked his landscapes. They seemed to convey that strange Stoke light which appeals to me and the old buildings and streets which were very much part of my own childhood and youth.|$|E

When Yancey's friend asked the woman if she had sought help at a local church, she answered, [...] "Church? Why would I ever go there? I was already feeling terrible about myself. They'd just make me feel worse." [...] This story convinced Yancey that Christians are doing a poor job of communicating the message that God is willing to accept people, regardless of what they have done; the story haunted him, he said, because the woman was [...] "the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> would have gone to Jesus.

Ohshima stressed that he was aiming at a wider audience and not the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> only played Sonic the Hedgehog, adding that [...] "players should recognise the Sonic Team touch immediately" [...] with Burning Rangers. The working title was Firefighter, but it was dropped as the team wanted a [...] "cooler" [...] sounding name. Naka felt that [...] "burning" [...] had a [...] "go for it!" [...] connotation in Japanese, and fit with the disaster-rescue theme. He was initially unsure about having [...] "ranger" [...] in the title as he felt that a ranger referred to park rangers in western culture. The team thought {{that the image of}} a [...] "ranger" [...] also brought to mind the Power Rangers franchise, and after consulting speakers of other languages, Burning Rangers was chosen as the game's name.|$|E

[...] She also said of [...] "Taboo"'s themes, [...] "Instead of trying stuff out and experiencing it, we put up a 'No' sign, we never try to break the taboos" [...] and [...] "Sometimes we shouldn't retreat into safety, we should have courage to do things. Those are the feelings kin the song." [...] Such themes are also present in her music videos: she has incorporated her [...] "sexy" [...] image into her videos since [...] "Crazy 4 U" [...] through sexually charged dances and skin-baring outfits.

[...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a mixed review, writing [...] "I {{have always been the}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> admires the creative attempt, even if the attempt isn't a complete success.

In an interview with PC Gamer, the game's creative director, Chris Metzen stated, [...] "Tracer [...] one of the first characters we really got to know. And while she wasn't particularly created to be a starring role, if you will, we felt on the team, the more we got to know her and play her, she was kind of like this Spider-Man type character for us. She's so rad, and it feels good to leverage her in the front of story ideas." [...] Tracer has also been noted for being a peppy character, with Hardcore Gamers Kevin Dunsmore describing her as a [...] "spunky Brit [...] full of little quips as she zips around the battlefield". Kaplan described [...] "Tracer [...] cute and playful, and she's the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> does everything with a wink and a smile." [...] In an interview with PCGamesN, game designer Michael Chu stated that [...] "the thing about Tracer is that she has a personality which is out of the norm for most people. She is incredibly optimistic, she is incredibly bubbly - it's part of her hero persona. We love her, I think she is very much one of the main characters of the game [...] really carry the torch of what the game is all about: heroism." [...] To reflect her English origin, Tracer is voiced by English actress Cara Theobold.|$|E

40|$|A major {{drawback}} {{to the traditional}} Markov formulation of mobility processes is that it assumes population homogeneity with respect to transition behavior. This assumption is clearly violated in most instances of social mobility. In an attempt to relax the homogeneity requirement and still retain the essential character of a Markov process, Blumen, Kogan, and McCarthy (1955) developed the "mover-stayer" model in which heterogeneity is attributed to the presence <b>of</b> two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> differ in their rates of move- ment. In the present paper, the mover-stayer model is generalized to permit a continuous distribution <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> by rate <b>of</b> mobility.

500|$|Stevie is {{the privately}} educated {{daughter}} of rich parents, who have abandoned {{her to go}} travelling. [...] She {{is said to be}} clueless about real life, with her profile on the official E20 website describing her as generous, creative and unlucky in love, though she has a boyfriend. Although she is described as posh, Fairbank-Hynes said Stevie is not just like a posh girl in East London, but would be out of place anywhere as she is in her own world. Fairbank-Hynes opined that posh characters in Walford stand out and can bring comedy to the show. Stevie is very naive and, according to Fairbank-Hynes, [...] "away with the fairies"—the most naive person anyone could meet. However, writer Emer Kenny was worried that Stevie being [...] "away with the fairies" [...] would make her unrealistic, but said that Fairbank-Hynes made the character recognisable. Because of Stevie's naivety and her kind nature, people see this as an invitation to take advantage of her. Stevie does not understand why people are cruel to her because she sees the good in them and wants to look after them, be around people and mother them. Fairbank-Hynes commented, [...] "Stevie's the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> thinks a stranger is a friend she hasn't met yet". However, Stevie is very forward, which can scare people away. She is also creative, empathetic and a complete daydreamer who lacks common sense but has bursts of assertiveness and intelligence, which can surprise people. Thompson said that Stevie has a good balance as she can be ditzy but also quite smart. Fairbank-Hynes identified with the character's mad outbursts, innocence and daydreaming, and also said Stevie is quirky, lovely and eccentric. Her daydreaming can lead people to believe she is a bimbo, but she is not.|$|E

He was the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> was very approachable and always looked to new challenges. Matthew had a great passion for equality and always stood up for the acceptance of people's differences." [...] Michele Josue, who had been Shepard's friend and later created a documentary about him, Matt Shepard is A Friend of Mine, described him as [...] "a tenderhearted and kind person." [...] In February 1995, Shepard was beaten and raped during a high school trip to Morocco. This caused him to experience depression and panic attacks, according to his mother. One of Shepard's friends feared that his depression had driven him to become involved with drugs during his time in college. Multiple times, Shepard was hospitalized due to his clinical depression and suicidal ideation.|$|E
5000|$|In the British {{jurisdiction}} of England and Wales the Lunacy Acts 1890-1922 referred to [...] "lunatics", but the Mental Treatment Act 1930 changed the legal term to [...] "person of unsound mind", an expression which was replaced under the Mental Health Act 1959 by [...] "mental illness". [...] "Person of unsound mind" [...] was the term used in 1950 in the English {{version of the}} European Convention on Human Rights as one <b>of</b> the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> could be deprived of liberty by a judicial process.

2500|$|The first {{character}} sketches {{were submitted}} in 2012. Soejima {{worked closely with}} Hashino so the characters and environments reflected the game's themes. Due to being high school students, Soejima {{found it difficult to}} make each main character's uniform design distinctive, instead expressing their individuality through their thief costumes. The protagonist's design was cited by Soejima as his most challenging recent work. The protagonist needed to both convey a taste of the game's overall artstyle, and to act as an avatar for the player. As the main theme and narrative of Persona 5 revolved around crime and vigilantes triggered by the protagonist voluntarily choosing that path, Soejima needed to convey this while allowing the character to suit whatever dialogue choices the player decided upon. Due to these difficulties, the protagonist was given multiple designs in a trial and error process to find the best one. As the [...] "phantom thief" [...] premise was a common stereotype in fiction, Soejima initially drew the protagonist and main cast in a style similar to shōnen manga, but these designs were scrapped as they clashed with the Persona series' realistic aesthetics. As with previous entries, the protagonist was a silent character, so as with previous protagonist Soejima had to work out a way he could communicate without dialogue. His solution was to imagine the Persona 5 protagonist as the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> made plans but did not share them with others. The Persona designs, being based on literary characters, were intended to evoke both familiarity and surprise from players. Once the names were chosen, Soejima designed the Personas based on that character.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the general}} drift of such talks as {{did seem to}} {{penetrate}} the question was this, that among these stop-the-war people there are really three types. First there is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> hates violence and the infliction of pain under any circumstances, and who have a mystical belief in the rightness (and usually the efficacy) of non-resistance. These are generally Christians, and then their cardinal text is the instruction to [...] "turn the other cheek." [...] Often they are Quakers. If they are consistent they are vegetarians and wear Lederlos boots. They do not desire police protection for their goods. They stand aloof from all the force and conflict of life. They have always done so. This is an understandable and respectable type. It has numerous Hindu equivalents. It is a type that finds little difficulty about exemptions--provided the individual has not been too recently converted to his present habits. But {{it is not the}} prevalent type in stop-the-war circles. Such genuine ascetics do not number more than a thousand or so, all three of our western allied countries.

Second, “designing for personalized support ” will extend the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> can successfully participate, because the resulting user interfaces are attuned to diverse cognitive capacities and momentary work contexts.

40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that chief {{executive}} officers of publicly-held corporations in the United States are losing power to their boards of directors and to their shareholders. This loss of power is recent (say, since 2000) and gradual, but nevertheless represents a significant {{move away from the}} imperial CEO who was surrounded by a hand-picked board and lethargic shareholders. After discussing the concept of power and its dimensions, we document the causes and symptoms of the decline in CEO power in several areas: share ownership composition and shareholder activism; governance rules and the board response to shareholder activism; regulatory changes related to shareholder voting; changes in the board of directors; and executive compensation. We argue that this decline in CEO power represent a long-term trend, rather than a temporary response to economic and political conditions. The decline in CEO power has several important implications, including implications with respect to the possibility of a regulatory backlash against certain newly empowered shareholder groups, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> will serve on corporate boards in the future, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> shareholder initiatives that will be introduced and the corporate response to them, the convergence of corporate laws across countries, and the source of resistance to acquisitions and the legal regulation of target defenses...|$|R
40|$|Undue {{emphasis}} {{has been}} placed on rising rates of readmission to psychiatric facilities. After a decade of preoccupation with discharge rates, readmission statistics have been singled out in the last 15 years as the key factor for assessing hospital effectiveness. A study of a group of patients at high risk for recurrent hospitalization revealed that these patients were characterized more by features relating to environmental supports than by diagnosis. The operational definition for recurrent hospitalization (five or more admissions during the 2 -year period preceding the latest admission) was effective in identifying this group; this is the first reported instance in which the definition has specified a certain number of admissions within a time-limited period. The findings of this study, as well as of an analysis of case histories and consumer opinion, led to the design of a pilot program for persons undergoing recurrent hospitalization. Readmission statistics are useless or misleading as measures of hospital effectiveness and efficiency; what matters is the way the former patients function in the community after discharge. Rather than simply trying to reduce the readmission rate psychiatric facilities should be examining the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> are hospitalized recurrently to develop programs aimed at improving the functioning of these people in the community...|$|R
