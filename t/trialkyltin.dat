The benefits of using organotin reagents are that they are air and moisture stable (some reactions can even take place in water), they can be synthesized, purified by chromatography, and store for long periods of time, and they are tolerant of most functional groups.

40|$|The <b>trialkyltins</b> {{tributyltin}} (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPT) {{can function}} as rexinoid-X receptor (RXR) agonists. We recently showed that RXR agonists can alter thyroid hormone (TH) signaling in a mammalian pituitary TH-responsive reporter cell line, GH 3. TRE-Luc. The prevalence of TBT and TPT {{in the environment}} prompted us to test whether they could also affect TH signaling. Both <b>trialkyltins</b> induced the integrated luciferase reporter alone and potentiated TH activation at low doses. Trimethyltin, which is not an RXR agonist, did not. Weturned to a simple, robust, and specific in vivo model system of TH action: metamorphosis of Xenopus laevis, the African clawed frog. Using a precocious metamorphosis assay, we found that 1 nM TBT and TPT, but not trimethyltin, greatly potentiated the effect of TH treatment on resorption phenotypes of the tail, which is lost at metamorphosis, and in the head, which undergoes extensive remodeling including gill loss. Consistent with these responses, TH-induced caspase- 3 activation in the tail was enhanced by cotreatment with TBT. Induction of a transgenic reporter gene and endogenous collagenase 3 (mmp 13) and fibroblast-activating protein-α (fap) genes were not induced by TBT alone, but TH induction was significantly potentiated by TBT. However, induction of other TH receptor target genes such as TRβ and deiodinase 3 by TH were not affected by TBT cotreatment. These data indicate that <b>trialkyltins</b> that can function as RXR agonists can selectively potentiate gene expression and resultant morphological programs directed by TH signaling in vivo. </p...|$|R
40|$|Dibutyltin- 3 -hydroxyflavone bromiide, Bu 2 Sn(of), is a {{fluorescent}} probe inhibitor of mitochondrial F 1 F 0 ATPase which reacts with and titrates {{a component of}} F 0 with marked fluorescence enhancement and reacts similarly with chloroplast CF 1 CF 0 and V-ATPases. Its use to monitor the interactions of other F 0 inhibitors (venturicidin, oligomycin, DCCD) with F 1 F 0 ATPase, both membrane-bound and purified by solubilization is described. <b>Trialkyltins</b> (Bu 3 SnCl) back-titrate all Bu 2 Sn(of) interaction sites; whereas the macrolide inhibitor venturicidin backtitrates 60 +/- 5 % and oligomycin only 30 +/- 3 % of Bu 2 Sn(of) interaction sites.

40|$|Dibutyltin- 3 -hydroxyflavone, Bu 2 Sn(of), {{is a new}} {{fluorescence}} probe inhibitor of F 1 F 0 -ATPase and {{oxidative phosphorylation}} which inhibits by titration of an unidentified component of F 0. Its site of action {{is closely related to}} that of the <b>trialkyltins</b> and of venturicidin. This F 0 component is part of a Pool of this component which is present in the heart mitochondrial inner membrane at levels of 5 - 7 nmol (mg protein) - 1 [18 +/- 3 Bu 2 Sn(of) sites per mol F 1 F 0 -ATPase]. However, ATPase activity in submitochondrial particles is near maximally inhibited by titration of approx. three Bu 2 Sn(of) sites per mol F 1 F 0 -ATPase. Over 60 % (60 - 80 %) of the Bu 2 Sn(of) interaction sites can be lost during the purification of F 1 F 0 -ATPase from submitochondrial particles. The number of Bu 2 Sn(of) interaction sites in various F 1 F 0 -ATPase preparations is variable. The high numbers of Bu 2 Sn(of) sites per mol F 1 F 0 -ATPase for heart mitochondria (18 - 21) and submitochondrial particles (15 - 19. 5) decline in ATP synthase (11 - 15) to the low values obtained in Complex V (7 - 10. 5) and the minimal values observed in highly purified F 1 F 0 -ATPase (3. 5 - 5. 6), thus indicating a variable dissociable component or cofactor of ATP synthase. The Bu 2 Sn(of) interaction site, a component of ATP synthase, is responsive to the redox status of the respiratory chain and the interaction with Bu 2 Sn(of) is with the reduced form of this component. Fluorescence titration studies show that this component is in redox equilibrium with the ubiquinone pool of the respiratory chain. It is proposed that this redox component serves as an inhibitor titratable cofactor pool which cycles through an F 0 interaction site (or sites) via a system which serves as an energy-transfer link between the respiratory chain and ATP synthase...|$|R

40|$|From the {{synthesis}} of the first organotin, in mid nineteenth century, and the amazing discovery of {{a wide spectrum of}} exploitations and industrial uses of these man-made chemicals in the subsequent century, the dark side of organotins increasingly came out {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century. Organotins now represent a matter of environmental concerns, for the toxic effects displayed on a wide spectrum of organisms, from bacteria to humans, and for the global contamination, especially of water basins which act as reservoirs. Unfortunately, but realistically, contamination and worries are fated to persist, due to the environmental persistency and high bioaccumulation potential of these pollutants. In spite of the wealth of studies, the intimate mechanisms of the toxic action of organotin compounds are not entirely established and our knowledge needs to be continuously reviewed and updated. This e-book aims at gathering the emerging data on organotin effects on animals, with special focus on their biochemical interactions with biomolecules, on which toxicity mechanisms are often founded. Chapter by chapter, the biological and biochemical effects of organotins are unravelled by a careful analysis of the most recent findings, paying special attention to the contaminant action mechanisms at cellular and molecular level. In the first chapter, the legislation on organotin-based antifouling paints and organotin contamination levels of aquatic environments are carefully reviewed. Special attention is paid to the most known toxic effect, namely imposex, which is a irreversible superimposition of male-type genitalia in female gastropod mollusks. Imposex mirrors environmental concentrations of the most toxic organotins. The structural and chemical properties of toxic organotin compounds are carefully examined in Chapter 2, with special focus on their biological and pharmacological activities. In Chapter 3 the recent discovery of direct high affinity interactions between <b>trialkyltins</b> and the family of nuclear hormone receptors which function as ligand dependent transcription factors for lipophilic endocrine hormones in vertebrates and invertebrates is presented. Studies on the interactions of organotins with model and natural biological membranes are reported in Chapter 4. The ability of organotins to act as endocrine-disrupting chemicals is considered in Chapter 5, focusing on TBT- induced imposex in neogastropods. Chapter 6 embraces the most recent knowledge on the molecular and biochemical mechanisms involved in lipid homeostasis disruption within several metazoan phyla, from mollusks to amphibians, teleosts and mammals. In Chapter 7 the organotin-driven genotoxicity and immunotoxicity, which among toxic effects are the most important in affecting survival, are reviewed in mammals, fish and aquatic invertebrates. Effects on mitochondria, one of the main targets of organotins are considered in Chapter 8. The impairment of mitochondrial functions and the consequent ATP synthesis depletion may play a crucial role as molecular basis of several toxic effects of organotins. Chapter 9 reviews the impact of organotin exposure on fresh- and seawater organisms of various phyla by examining the histophathological, physiological and molecular interactions of organotin compounds with relevant enzymes, membranes, the endocrine system, and the consequential ramifications for individuals, populations and community structure in aquatic ecosystems. Recent research on the mechanisms of organotin-induced apoptosis is reviewed in Chapter 10. The modulation of apoptosis, involved in ontogenesis, development and cell turnover, is a critical step of cellular toxicity. Chapter 11 reviews the impacts of organotins on humans and presents major applications of organotins, their entry in the food chain, human exposure and effects of organotins. Once overviewed the broad susceptibility to organotins in literature data, Chapter 12 underlines the astonishing analogies of the toxic action of these chemicals in animal kingdom on one hand and on the other, the variegated toxicity displayed in different cells, tissues and species...|$|R
40|$|Organic Intermetallic Derivatives of TinSome {{reactions}} of <b>trialkyltin</b> alkali metal derivatives were studied {{with the view}} to their use as synthetic reagents for the; introduction of the <b>trialkyltin</b> radical into other molecules and ultimately for syntheses of compounds in which tin would be covalently bonded to a metal from another chemical group. The reactions studied in ether-like solvents indicated that reaction between <b>trialkyltin</b> lithium compounds and organo-metallic halides led either to occurrence of metal-halogen exchange reactions or dissociation of the <b>trialkyltin</b> lithium. In the former case the symmetrical organo-dielement compounds were formed, e. g. hexamethylditin, cacodyl; and in the latter case, the alkyl lithium, produced by dissociation, reacted with the organo-metallic halide resulting in replacement of the halogen with an alkyl group. When, however, reaction between a <b>trialkyltin</b> lithium and an alkyl halide was carried out the expected reaction occurred, since, in this case, the reaction between the halide and any alkyl lithium produced by dissociation would be relatively slow, thus enhancing the chance of reaction between the alkyl halide and the <b>trialkyltin</b> group. Reactions carried out with elements from Group VI,sulphur and selenium, led to formation of the desired compounds methyltrimethyltin sulphide and methyltrimethyltin selenide. The latter compound contained a tin-selenium bond which {{does not appear to}} have been reported previously. In these reactions the <b>trialkyltin</b> radical was present in cationic form (as the bromide) and the Group VI elements in anionic form, so that metal-halogen exchange reactions would be most unlikely to occur. As the reactions with tin in cationic form had been successful a reaction between dimethylarsenic sodium and trimethyltin bromide was studied in liquid ammonia. However, results from this reaction again indicated that formation of the symmetrical di-element compounds occurred rather than combination of the <b>trialkyltin</b> radical with the dimethylarsenic group. As the reactions studied with <b>trialkyltin</b> alkali metal derivatives in ether-like solvents had shown that they behaved in a complex manner with a variety of reagents attention was directed to the rather limited use of liquid ammonia as a solvent for effecting {{reactions of}} the type discussed. In this solvent most organo-metallic halides are rapidly ammonolysed, tin and gallium however being exceptions, the reaction between trimethyltin sodium and dimethylgallium chloride mon-ammine was investigated. Therewas no indication that a tin-gallium bond was formed, tin being recovered as hexamethylditin and gallium as dimethylgallium amide. Part IICopperacetylide ComplexesSome new co-ordination complexes of copperacetylides and of silveracetylides, which appear hitherto unknown, were prepared and some of their properties investigated. In the series nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic it was found that the order of stability of the coordination complexes was N ((P) As, those of phosphorus being by far the most stable. An important difference between the alkyl- and aryl- copperacetylide triethyl- phosphine complexes was observed in their behaviour in solution, in which the former dissociated(R-C≡CCuP(C 2 H 5) 3 R-C≡CCu + (C 2 H 5) 5 P). Suchdissociation was also exhibited by the phenylsilver-acetylide-triethylarsine and -iso-propylamine complexes. The alkylcopperacetylide complexes oxidised rapidly in air, whereas the corresponding arylcopperacetylide compounds were much more stable. There was no indication that co-ordination of the metal acetylides occurred with sulphur co-ordinating reagents. Molecular weight determinations, where possible, showed that the co-ordination complexes were generally highly associated, the alkyls more so than the aryls, but the silver compounds less so than the corresponding copper co-ordination complexes. In the case of t-butylcopperacetylide, whichis soluble in organic solvents, molecular weight determinations confirmed earlier results, and showed that the copperacetylide was also highly associated. The relative stability of the copper- and silver acetylides and their co-ordination compounds has been discussed and attributed to co-ordination of the metal with an acetylene group from another molecule, in accordance with the conclusions of earlier work on t-butylcopperacetylide.. Any formation of a complex R-C≡C. ML (M=Gu or Ag, L = ligand) must be the result of successful competition between the M-acetylene co-ordination, which leads to the polymerization of R-C≡CM itself, and the co-ordination -M-L. Sincethe acetylides are, in general, only depolymerised by those ligands known to be the strongest donors to copper and silver (namely aliphatic tertiary phosphines), and since the resulting compounds R-C≡CM-L are themselves associated in solution, presumably by metal-acetylene group interaction, the last must be supposed to be very strong. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{interactions}} of <b>trialkyltin</b> (TAT) compounds with the mitochondria were largely studied The current {{view of this}} phenomenon is that these compounds, by exploiting the Cl- and OH- gradient in energised mitochondria, behave as electroneutral OH-/Cl- exchangers. Experiments performed with triethyltin-, tripropyltin-, and tributyltin-chloride, allow as to propose an alternative mechanism. The crucial point of this new mechanism is that TATs enter the mitochondria as lipophilic cations (alkyl) (3) Sn+ and not as electroneutral compounds. The influx is followed by extrusion of the <b>trialkyltin</b> compounds as electroneutral hydroxi compounds (alkyl) (3) Sn-OH. Measurements of membrane potential show that the uptake of the TAT cation (alkyl) (3) Sn+ is followed by membrane depolarisation measured as {{the release of the}} trimethylphenylphosphonium probe. The depolarization occurs in the order: (Et) (3) Sn-Cl < (Pro) (3) Sn-Cl < (Bu) (3) Sn-Cl in agreement with the increasing lipophilicity of the tested compounds from ethyltin toward butyltin derivative.

40|$|<b>Trialkyltin</b> {{hydrides}} are versatile dehalogenation reagents {{which are}} known to react with organic halides via a free radical chain mechanism. 1 A useful modification of this procedure has been described recently which employs stoi-chiometric quantities of sodium borohydride and catalytic amounts of trialkyl-tin chlorides. 2 Since we have shown that sodium borohydride can also perform free radical chain dehalogenations, 3 it is of interest {{to know whether the}} catalytic amount of tin hydride or the borohydride is the immediate hydrogen atom source in these reactions. Hydrogen atom transfers from tin hydrides to carbon radicals {{are known to}} be extremely fast (k = 104 -lo 6 M-l sec-'j 4 yet there have been no comparisons of hydrogen atom transfers from tin to those from boron. This rate ratio and the stoichiometrically significant hydrogen source has been determined by ex-amination of kinetic isotope effects. Reaction of 7, 7 -dibromonorcarane (1) with sodium borohydride 5 or tri-n-butyltin hydride 6 affords cis- and tranz 7 -bromonorcarane (2 _ and 2) in 79 % and 02 % yields, respectively (Scheme I).

40|$|Alpha-branched {{amino acids}} are of {{mechanistic}} and therapeutic interest as inhibitors of pyridoxal phosphate dependent enzymes. They also have potential use in de novo peptide design. For both enzyme inhibition and peptide synthesis applications, enantiomerically enriched α-branched amino acids are desirable. Enantioselective approaches to α-branched amino acids will be described. ^ A procedure for {{the synthesis of}} L-α-vinylglycine from L-homoserine is described. Key features {{include the use of}} acid-labile protecting groups for the amino and carboxyl groups, {{and the use of the}} phenylselenolate equivalent derived from sodium borohydride and diphenyl diselenide for L-homoserine lactone cleavage. ^ One approach to α-branched amino acids makes use of chiral dianions, wherein a chiral auxiliary is appended via the ester functionality. A chiral alanine-derived dianion reacts diastereoselectively (∼ 90 : 10 - 96 : 4) with a variety of primary alkyl halides to provide ultimately, L-α-methyl amino acids. Similarly, alkylation of a chiral α-vinylglycine-derived dianion with a number of electrophiles gives L-α-vinyl amino acids with excellent stereoselectively (∼ 90 : 10 - 98 : 2 dr er). In both cases the chiral auxiliary can easily be recovered. ^ A self-regeneration of chirality approach to enantiomerically enriched α-vinyl amino acids is developed. Beginning from L-vinylglycine, the stereochemical information is transmitted from the original α-stereogenic center to a new β-stereogenic center via a PhSe-X-mediated 5 -exo-trig cyclization. Enantiomerically enriched cis- and trans-oxazolines result. These diastereomers are readily separated and carry stereochemical information at the β-center, leading ultimately to the formation of higher, L- and D-α-vinyl amino acids, following an alkylation/double bond-unmasking sequence. ^ A fundamentally new transformation, the direct conversion of vinyl selenides to vinyl stannanes under the agency of <b>trialkyltin</b> hydride is described. A preliminary investigation of the scope, limitations, and mechanism of this reaction has been carried out. This conversion allows for the straightforward synthesis of vinyl stannanes from aldehydes, ketones, and ω-vinyl amides and acids. ...|$|E
40|$|The first {{carbon dioxide}} {{thickeners}} {{have been successfully}} designed. Each thickener {{is characterized by a}} highly carbon dioxide-phobic functionality that imparts CO{sub 2 }-solubility and a carbon dioxide-phobic group that facilitates viscosity-enhancing intermolecular associations. The design of each thickener required that appropriate balance of these groups to yield a compound that was at least several weight percent soluble in CO{sub 2 } and capable of thickening the carbon dioxide by a factor of 2 - 20. Four types of thickeners were identified, fluoroacrylate-styrene copolymers (polyFAST), fluorinated telechelic ionomers, semi-fluorinated <b>trialkyltin</b> fluorides and small, fluorinated hydrogen-bonding compounds. Although significant viscosity increases (e. g. doubling the viscosity) were evidenced for each thickener during falling cylinder viscometry analysis, the polyFAST thickener provided the most dramatic increases at dilute concentration. PolyFAST is a bulk-polymerized, random copolymer of fluoroacrylate and styrene with a number-average molecular weight of about 500, 000. It appears as a white, slightly waxy solid at ambient conditions. The fluoroacrylate enhances the CO{sub 2 } solubility, while the styrene promotes intermolecular stacking of the aromatic groups. Although concentrations between 20 - 29 mol% styrene yield a thickener, the optimal composition of polyFAST for thickening was 29 mol% styrene and 71 mol% fluoroacrylate. Mobility measurements with a Berea sandstone core indicated that at a superficial velocity of one foot per day, a 0. 5 wt% concentration of 29 %styrene [...] 71 %fluoroacrylate polyFAST tripled the viscosity. At concentrations of 1 % and 1. 5 wt%, the CO{sub 2 } viscosity increased by a factor of 8 and 19, respectively. If lower proportions of styrene are used, the compound will dissolve more readily in carbon dioxide but the viscosity enhancement will diminish. At higher proportions of styrene, the CO{sub 2 } solubility decreases and the thickening capability also decreased, apparently due to the increased number of non-viscosity enhancing intramolecular interactions between the aromatic groups. The high price, environmental persistence, and lack of availability of bulk amounts of the fluoroacrylate monomer guided our final efforts of this work (and all of our efforts in its continuation) toward the development of inexpensive non-fluorous compounds. We have therefore initiated the design highly CO{sub 2 } soluble polymers that can replace the fluoroacrylate. These hydrocarbon-based CO{sub 2 }-philic compounds will then be incorporated into the structure of a compound that contains CO{sub 2 }-phobic associating groups, yielding a commercial thickener...|$|E
40|$|Natural gas liquid (NGL), {{a mixture}} {{consisting}} primarily of ethane, propane, and butane, {{is an excellent}} enhanced oil recovery (EOR) solvent. However, NGL is typically about ten times less viscous than the crude oil within the carbonate or sandstone porous media, which causes the NGL to finger through the rock toward production wells resulting in low volumetric sweep efficiency of the NGL solvent. In this work, targeted thickeners are broadly classified into two categories, polymeric thickener and small associative molecule thickener. In either case, the resultant thickened ethane, propane or butane solution {{is expected to be}} thermodynamically stable, transparent, and capable of flowing through the pore throats (1 micron) of sandstone or carbonate rock. In the category of polymeric thickeners, a dilute concentration of a drag-reducing agent (DRA) poly(α-olefin) that has an average molecular weight greater than 20, 000, 000 was proposed as a thickener for liquid butane, liquid propane and liquid or supercritical ethane. High molecular weight polydimethyl siloxane polymer (molecular weight of 1, 000, 000) and polyisobutylene (PIB) (molecular weight 10, 000, 000) were also assessed as potential thickeners for NGLs. Phase behavior data (cloud points) and viscosity induced by these polymeric thickeners were obtained as a function of temperature, pressure and concentration. Results indicate that butane is the most effective NGL component at both dissolving the polymer and expanding the polymer coils. In general, viscosity enhancement increases with decreasing temperature and increasing pressure, reflective of increased NGL solvent strength at low temperature and high pressure. Only the DRA induced significant viscosity changes for NGL at dilute polymer concentrations. To the best of my knowledge, the DRA-alkane mixture data presented in this thesis represent the most significant polymer-induced increases in viscosity reported to date for butane and propane and the first report of thickening ethane. Three types of small associating molecule thickeners were considered; <b>trialkyltin</b> fluoride, aluminum di-soaps, and crosslinked phosphate esters. Phase behavior (cloud point) and viscosity data were obtained as a function of temperature, pressure and concentration. The crosslinked phosphate ester mixture was difficult to dissolve completely in NGL and induced very modest viscosity changes, especially for ethane. Hydroxyaluminum di(2 -ethyl hexanoate) was insoluble in ethane, but was the best thickener for propane and butane at temperatures above 40 oC. However, the hydroxyaluminum di(2 -ethyl hexanoate) mixtures required heating to 100 oC to attain dissolution prior to cooling to the temperature of interest. Tributyltin fluoride was a remarkable thickener for ethane, propane and butane that did not require heating for dissolution. To the best of my knowledge, these tributyltin fluoride-ethane mixture results represent the first report of thickening ethane with a small associating molecule...|$|E
40|$|Radical cyclizations are {{important}} reactions in organic chemistry. However, they are seldom used industrially {{due to their}} reliance on neurotoxic <b>trialkyltin</b> hydride. Many substitutes for tin hydrides have been developed but none have provided a general solution to the problem. Transition metal hydrides with weak M-H bonds can generate carbon centered radicals by hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) to olefins. This metal to olefin hydrogen atom transfer (MOHAT) reaction has been postulated as the initial step in many hydrogenation and hydroformylation reactions. The Norton group has shown MOHAT can mediate radical cyclizations of ɑ,ω dienes to form five and six membered rings. The reaction can be done catalytically if 1) the product metalloradical reacts with hydrogen gas to reform the hydride and 2) the hydride can perform MOHAT reactions. The Norton group has shown that both CpCr(CO) ₃H and Co(dmgBF₂) ₂(H₂O) ₂ can catalyze radical cyclizations. However, both have significant draw backs. In an effort to improve the catalytic efficiency of these reactions we have studied several potential catalyst candidates to test their viability as radical cyclization catalysts. I investigate the hydride CpFe(CO) ₂H (FpH). FpH {{has been shown to}} transfer hydrogen atoms to dienes and styrenes. I measured the Fe-H bond dissociation free energy (BDFE) to be 63 kcal/mol (much higher than previously thought) and showed that this hydride is not a good candidate for catalytic radical cyclizations. I have investigated the dynamics of Co(dmgBF₂) ₂(H₂O) ₂ under hydrogen gas to attempt to observe its hypothesized cobalt hydride. Under large pressures up to 70 atm we see two species one which we assign as the cobalt hydride and one which we assign as a ligand protonated Co(I) complex. These are supported by high pressure NMR studies of the same complexes. By varying the H₂ pressure, we can calculate the hydrogen atom donor ability of the mixture formed under H₂ as 50 kcal/mol. This makes this mixture a very good H• donor. The Norton group has shown that vanadium hydrides have very weak V-H bonds that donate H* rapidly. However, they cannot be made catalytic under hydrogen gas. I have attempted to regenerate these vanadium hydrides by a sequential reduction then protonation of the metalloradical. With HV(CO) ₄dppe this only produced hydrogen gas, presumably by one electron reduction of HV(CO) ₄dppe. However, with HV(CO) ₄dppf this does not readily occur and this hydride could potentially be a catalyst for radical cyclizations. Many radical cyclizations involve vinyl (sp²) radicals. I have shown that both the CpCr(CO) ₃H and the Co(dmgBF₂) ₂(H₂O) ₂ systems can catalytically perform metal to alkyne hydrogen atom transfers (MAHAT's) and that these reactions can be used to perform radical cyclizations very efficiently...|$|E
