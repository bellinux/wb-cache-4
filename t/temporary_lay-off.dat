40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{challenge}} a rather common but stereotyped opinion, according to which the elderly in Italy live their last working years with a smooth transition from stable jobs into retirement. I use the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) to put the main stylized facts about the transition into retirement in Italy into a European Perspective. The ECHP, however, does not allow to track with a satisfactory level of detail many relevant mobility events that may characterize the elderly’s job histories. To get deeper into the subject, I turn to two longitudinal datasets of administrative source, covering the working careers in the Italian private sector for the years 1985 - 1996. Preliminary results on this archives show that – besides those whose transition from work to retirement occurs painlessly (who nonetheless represent the majority of cases) – there is a large number of workers whose final working years are marked by an irregular pattern of labour market activity. Trying and sorting out the high heterogeneity among the individual histories, we arrive to a classification of the most typical paths towards retirement that can be observed. Important cases include (i) people having multiple job spells at the end of their career; (ii) people who transit directly form periods of time on <b>temporary</b> <b>lay-off</b> (cassa integrazione) and on layoff lists (liste di mobilità) to retirement; (iii) people who experience long spells of unemployment without any benefit. The same paths are analyzed along the main individual and job characteristics, showing important differences particularly across geographical areas. ...|$|E

S'appuyant sur des chiffres et sur des faits éloquents, l'auteur examine cette situation et expose les rôles joués par les gouvernements fédéral et provinciaux dans le but de l'améliorer. Some {{facts and}} figures illustrate better than a long article {{the social and economic}} impact of the seasonal unemployment of {{an important part of the}} workers. In 1961, the population of the Province of Quebec amounted to 1, 471, 840 people, according to the Federal Census. At the end of January of the same year, 83, 791 people, according to the estimates of the Federal Minister of Labour, were without employment, i. e. a proportion of nearly 89 fc of the total-man power; at the end of February, 1952, 114, 973 people were in the same situation, making up at this time almost 8 % of the total active population. In studying the figures of the variations in employment since 1948, the following facts may be noted:The most recent information that we have on the length of unemployment in our district, show that on February 1, 1955, 53. 5 % or 7 705 people capable of work were looking for employment since a month or more than a month. The number of those looking for employment represented 7. 5 % of the active labour supply in the Quebec métropolitain district. If one takes into account the maximum weekly unemployment insurance payments made to unemployed persons, one may realize not only thé acuteness of the problems created to the families and to the society as a whole by seasonal unemployment, but also the depreciation of the collective buying power that the presence of such a large inactive mass creates in a district or a locality which may result in serious economic evils. Our province, and particularly our district, are especially vulnerable to the harm done by seasonal unemployment. The district of Quebec is, furthermore, very frequently a district with an excess of man-power, this surplus being mainly made of general or non-specialized labour coming to a large extent from neighbouring or more distant rural territories; for these workers, of which a large number emigrate by necessity, the city and district of Quebec constitutes the first stage and, quite often, the end of their road. There is then brought into existence in the metropolitan district a state of what could be called permanent unemployment, the unemployment that is known as "structural" unemployment, and which may be defined as being the result of a "surplus of labour in a city, and economic district or a country, taking into account the capacities for absorption of existing enterprises". A certain number of our industries, even important ones, are subject to two other particular types of unemployment: "competitive" unemployment, which, through the play of certain economic factors, result from the reduction in production in a plant or in an industrial sector. This "competitive" unemployment is characterized by a <b>temporary</b> <b>lay-off,</b> by a reduced work week or by shorter work days or by both. Finally, "competitive" unemployment may also lead to the worst, that is to say, the permanent dismissal of labour. The other type of unemployment, is technological unemployment which consists of the loss of employment brought about by new processes, new machines or new organization methods or even caused by the temporary or permanent loss of a market due to changes in consumers' tastes. If one examines finally the structure of the labour market of the Quebec district, one can easily detect that there exists a certain "occupational" lack of balance. Our territory contains a high percentage of seasonal industries or business. Furthermore, it is a market where a relatively high percentage of feminine labour is to be found, characterized by a frequently high turnover. NECESSITY OF POSITIVE MEASURESThe Federal government, who is considered in most circles as responsible for the general employment policy, has recently decided to alter the programme of public works wrich it was keeping in reserve in provision of general unemployment and to set up a new short-range programme more flexible, more changeable and more easily adaptable to employment conditions in the various regions of the country. Moreover, the provincial governments seem ready to carry out the various public works in taking their inspiration from the same conceptions, and in coordinating as much as possible the programme of public investment with that of the Federal government. An attempt is being made to apply the same methods to the level of municipal administrations. The main purpose of the government action should be to stimulate private activity or in other words, to give it a greater impetus. It only constitutes a partial and negative solution of the problem we are examining just now. It has become necessary to add some positive measures by making more flexible the income tax regulation on depreciation of capital invested during the months of seasonal unemployment, by influencing through some positive measures the private as well as the public policies on credit and by certain other action of a similar nature, which would have as direct result the quickening of private initiative...|$|E

INTRODUCTIONIn discussing seniority provisions, {{one may be}} exposed to making rather serious mistakes in taking a wrong or too restrictive approach to the subject. It {{would be wrong to}} isolate seniority provisions from the collective agreements of which they are such an important part, and treat them like some kind of suspended and rootless concepts ; and it would be equally wrong to isolate these collective agreements at least from some aspects of the environment (institutional, social, economic, etc.) within which they apply. In this article, some comments will be made regarding collective agreements in Canada, in descriptive as well as in purely statistical terms. Secondly, seniority provisions will be dealt with in the same way : their substance will be discussed as well as their incidence. THE IMPORTANCE OF COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTSA suggested definition of the collective agreementLet us take collective agreements first. When one speaks of the importance of collective agreements in Canada, one can think of several reasons that can justify such a statement. The first such reason might well perhaps be {{the very nature of the}} agreement itself. What is a collective agreement ? Personally, we would compare it to« a private law which, for a given period of time, lays down the working conditions for a group of employees, a group which in more legal terms is called a bargaining unit. That is to say that for the duration of the collective agreement, conditions set forth therein may not be modified by either party unless both parties, by mutual agreement, decide otherwise. We wish to add also that the collective agreement includes a grievance procedure which provides for the examination of complaints arising from alleged violations or supposedly erroneous interpretations of the clauses of the collective agreement ; we emphasize : the purpose of the grievance procedure is not to amend the clauses of the collective agreement, but to examine grievances concerning the application of the collective agreement, such grievances in no way constituting demands for modification of the agreement » 1. Some figures regarding number of employees under collective agreementsA second reason why collective agreements ought to be considered as very important documents in our national life, would of course be the high proportion of employees covered by these agreements in a number of major Canadian industries or occupational sectors. The following few figures are taken from the Department of Labour's report onWorking Conditions in Canadian Industry for the year 1966  : close to 70 % of employees, excluding office employees, in the very diverse manufacturing industry were covered by collective agreements. If we examine this industry by sector, we note that the proportion of workers under agreements amounted to 96 % in pulp and paper, to 98 % in tire manufacturing; in the key railway sector, 96 % of the travelling personnel are under collective agreements ; of course such percentage are not typical of all cases, far from it; however, the sectors which have just been enumerated are important. We might also point out that the estimated number of employees, in a very wide range of occupations indeed, covered by collective agreements in Canada is in the vicinity of 1, 900, 000 2 — an estimate for which we wish to take responsibility. The content of the collective agreementA third reason why collective agreements are important is their very substance. We have stated on a previous occasion that in our largely unplanned economic and social system, very many matters are left to the parties to collective bargaining to decide, while in other countries with a planned or less planned system, many of these matters are covery by legislation. What are some of these matters contained in our collective agreements ? Vacations, paid sick leave, job evaluation systems, education al leave, training or retraining provisions, seniority rules, etc [...] [...] to cite but a few. The impact of the environment on collective agreementsHaving said this, one must also point out that our labour relations system, being based primarily on the local employee — management relationship places the parties to collective bargaining and their collective agreements very close to local problems and also close to the community within which the collective agreement is applied. In other and perhaps more simple words, the parties to collective bargaining in this country are generally close to the anxieties, frustrations, aspirations and traditions of those to whom collective agreements apply. A few examples might perhaps be in order here. Community traditions may have an impact on the number of paid holidays provided for in collective agreements. Strongly family-oriented traditions may have an impact on the kind of paid bereavement leave provisions that are introduced in the agreement : in some instances, some of our agreement analysts, we clearly recall, have noted that the benefits provided under this type of provision tend to be more generous in the Province of Québec than in the Province of Ontario. It can also be speculated that strong family orientations might even have an impact on the type of seniority provisions that are introduced in the agreement : some seniority provisions, in dealing with promotions and layoffs, will take into consideration such factors as the number of dependents, as well as length of service and ability, when considering employees for promotion or retention. Another example. A community which for a long time may have frowned upon the employment of women in industrial occupations will not likely provide strong encouragement to the parties to collective bargaining to introduce a maternity leave provision in their agreement. And as an indication that social pressures might have an impact on the employee relations process, would it be unrealistic to assume that certain community attitudes might put a degree of pressure on the parties to collective bargaining so that the benefits provided under a maternity leave provision would be offered to married mothers only ?In addition to the broad social and cultural environment, the very type of activity which is engaged in, in the establishment where the agreement applies is also going to have an impact on the content of the agreement. For example, because of the nature of the work performed in an occupational sector, safety provisions may be more frequent in that sector than in another. One can also speculate that in plants and offices that include highly specialized or differentiated occupations, seniority provisions might be, in certain areas, implemented on an occupational basis rather than on a wider basis. The impact of collective agreements on the environmentBefore turning to seniority provisions more specifically, we would want to make one final observation. Indeed in what has just been stated, the impression might have been conveyed that in relation to their environment, collective agreements are simply reflecting environmental conditions, and adjusting to environ-mental changes. If this is the impression that the previous observations have conveyed, it should be firmly stated that such is not our view. For it can be said that collective agreements, by adjusting to environmental and other changes, may obviously facilitate and accelerate change and thereforecontribute to change, and they may generate other changes in turn. Again, perhaps an example would be in order. A useful degree of awareness has been generated regarding problems that technological change and automation may present to employees and to management. More specifically, there is, I believe, a well developed awareness that the introduction of changes in technology may require new or up-dated skills, and new knowledge. Then, when in a context of changes in technology, the collective agreement provides that a training or retraining program will be offered to employees, with the financial support of the company, is it not true that this particular program might in fact do more than narrowly respond to a new educational requirement that has resulted from a changing technology in a particular office or establishment? It is our view that in fact that program may represent a new venture and a new experiment in adult education and adaptability, and in adult training ; it may generate new attitudes on the part of employees towards education, and it may well encourage management and employees' organizationselsewhere to take similar steps in an effort not only to adjust to change, but to facilitate change and progress 3. Other examples could be offered that would also suggest that collective agreements are not only subjected to environmental factors and forces, but do generate changes also. SENIORITY PROVISIONSLet us, then, turn to seniority and seniority provisions, and emphasize that our experience has been in the analysis of seniority provisions, not in their negotiation. Major aspects of seniority provisions will be examined in this article. It may be that to those who have had practical experience in dealing with seniority provisions at the bargaining table, our treatment of such provisions may appear too rigid or too theoretical. That might well be. It will be pointed out, however, that these concepts should be considered as tools of analysis, and that as such they have proven to be very useful in our work in the Federal Department of Labour. Some figures concerning the incidence of seniority provisions in collective agreementsAt the outset it might be of interest to know that in our major study on Collective Agreements Provisions in Major Manufacturing Establishments, that we released in 1964, 90 % of the establishments surveyed (non-office workers) had seniority provisions on promotions of employees, and that in 97 % of the establishments surveyed, there was a seniority provision on lay-offs. In a more recent study onProvisions in Collective Agreements covering office employees in Canadian manufacturing industries (1967), 86 % of the agreements studied had a provision regarding seniority on promotion, while 97 % of the agreements examined had a provision regarding seniority on lay-off. So much for the incidence of some of the most important seniority provisions ; it should perhaps be emphasized that these data are for the manufacturing sector only. However, our definite impression is that the figures just quoted represent a fairly accurate picture of the incidence of seniority provisions in a number of Canadian industrial and occupational sectors. Let us now turn to the substance of seniority provisions and proceed somewhat systematically with various concepts. 1. We would broadly define seniority as the status acquired by an employee at his (her) place of employment through his (her) length of service. This definition, at brief as it is, raises some questions on our minds. It will be understood that only some of these questions can be raised here. How is seniority acquired ? How is it lost ? For example, is an employee going to accumulate seniority starting with his (her) first day of employment with the company, or is he (she) going to start accumulating seniority once he (she) has successfully completed his (her) probationary period ? Once the employee's probationary period is successfully completed, is the length of this period going to be credited to the employee in terms of seniority ? What happens to the employee's seniority when for example she or he is on <b>temporary</b> <b>lay-off?</b> How long can the employee retain the seniority he or she had accumulated prior to being laid-off ? What happens to her seniority when an employee goes on maternity leave ? Does she retain it ? Or does she not only retain it, but continue to accumulate it while she is on leave ? Or can she accumulate seniority only during a certain period of her leave ? More generally, could there be some types of leave during which continued accumulation of seniority would be provided for, while seniority accumulated prior to the taking of the leave would simply be retained during other types of leave? Does an employee who has had to leave the company through no fault of his (her) own, or has simply decided to leave the company, automatically lose his (her) seniority ? 4 These are a few of the many questions that can be raised. 2. For the purpose of analyzing seniority provisions, we have considered two major types of seniority concepts : the first one, straight seniority, means that length of service is the only factor to be considered ; for example, employees would be promoted on the basis of their length of service alone ; in our own experience, this type of seniority is very seldom found in collective agreements in relation to promotions and lay-offs. Which type of seniority concept is, then, more frequently found ?Contingent or modified seniority is far more prevalent in the agreements we have analyzed ; and it simply means that other factors than length of service (such as ability to do the job, performance, punctuality, etc.) are to be considered along with length of service. Perhaps two brief examples here may be more helpful than a lengthy explanation. Here are, then, two examples of collective agreement provisions based in our view on the concept of contingent or modified seniority :Example 1  : « In cases of promotions, [...] ., the skills, ability and efficiency of the employees shall be the governing factor and where these things are equal, seniority shall be the governing factor [...] .  »Example 2  : « In the event of reduction of staff and rehiring of employees seniority shall apply provided the employée with the greater amount of seniority can satisfactorily perform the job he is assigned to, or can learn the job within reasonable time [...] .  »These two provisions, illustrating the concept of contingent or modified seniority, are also an illustration of two subconcepts. Example 1 was indeed based on what could be called the concept ofequal ability, meaning that seniority will govern if there is equality in ability (and other factors, if any) to perform the job ; example 2 was based, on the other hand, on the concept ofsufficient ability, meaning that seniority will govern if the employee has sufficient ability to perform the job. Fields of seniority recognition 3. The two provisions just cited also provided examples of areas where seniority would be taken into account — or what might be called « fields of seniority recognition ». Example 1 had to do with the problem of staff reduction and rehiring, while example 2 dealt with promotions. There can of course be other fields of seniority recognition : transfers, choice of vacation time, choice of working time, to mention a few. There is also the range of length-of-service related benefits such as graduated vacation plans, sick leave, etc., that one finds in collective agreements. Seniority Units 4. A brief word should now perhaps be said about seniority units; in other words (and to proceed descriptively) one can have occupation-wide, department-wide, plant-wide, company-wide (in multi-plant company), etc., seniority units. Without wanting to go into too many details, our understanding of the seniority unit it the unit within which the years of service of the employee are considered : for example, an employee may have been fifteen years, in the plant, but only 7 years in department X of the plant. It could be stated, therefore, that such an employee has fifteen years' plant seniority, and 7 years' seniority in department X. These may be very important distinction since the seniority of the employee (together with other factors, depending on that the provision says) might be considered on a plant-wide basis in cases of lay-offs for example ; and his seniority might be considered on a department-wide basis in cases of promotions. One example will be provided here of the latter type of provisions, and one example of the former 5. Enough has perhaps been stated at this point to suggest that seniority provisions can indeed be very important to employees : in terms not only of promotional opportunities, but also in terms of job protection, work satisfaction, etc. Seniority provisions in a context of changing technologyYet when we read a seniority provision, we always tend to place it — perhaps as should be done — in the world of work of 1970, which is one of fast changing technology. In relation to this very point, and before concluding, a few questions will be raised. When a seniority clause provides that « in cases of promotions, [...] . the skills, ability and efficiency of the employees shall be the governing factor and where these things are equal, seniority shall be the governing factor [...] .  » some questions are raised in our minds and these questions are simply submitted here for consideration. In a context of a changing technology resulting in new skill requirements, what would be the real meaning of « equal ability » as between senior and younger employees, in organizations where senior employees — set in their habits and perhaps in skills in need of updating — would be competing for promotion with younger employees freshly graduated from recognized institutes of technology and science, and mastering the knowledge required for an effective performance in those jobs open for promotion ? Furthermore, in these situations, what would be attitude of an employee's organization towards changes in technology, an organization whose membership might be considered « senior » in terms of length of service ? Or, what would be the attitude of an employees' organization with a younger membership towards displaced older employees ? And what would be the attitude of management naturally — as it should — preoccupied with efficiency ?CONCLUSIONThese were some questions that we had wished to raise by way of conclusion. It is hoped that it has been demonstrated in this article that to discuss collective agreements and seniority provisions is not to be involved in theoretical dissertations. Collective agreements and their seniority provisions, as well as their other provisions, are not only close to and part of, the work lives of hundreds of thousands of Canadians. They can also have an impact on the total of their lives. * The remarks contained in this article, are derived from a statement made by the author to theInstitute on Collective Bargaining of theRegistered Nurses' Association of Ontario (Toronto, November, 1968), are personal in nature and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Canada Department of Labour of which, at the time of the presentation of this statement, the author was an officer, nor do they necessarily reflect the Pay Research Bureau of which since July 1, 1969, the author is Assistant-Director (Research). 1 Importance of Collective Agreements in Canada — an address to the Richelieu Club of Hull (Que.), by Félix QUINET, January 16, 1968, pp. 3 - 4. 2 This figure is quoted fromImportance of Collective Agreements in Canada — an address to the Richelieu Club of Hull (Que.), by Félix QUINET, January 16, 1968, pp. 3 - 4. 3 It might perhaps be in order to suggest here that collective agreements may also make contributions in equally important contexts as that of the response to technological change. To illustrate this point, a couple of questions might be raised : When employees with a grievance realize that the complaints which they make are studied closely by an impartial arbitrator, because of the collective agreement, will these employees not have a very concrete and practical concept of the working of justice ? Is it unrealistic to believe that it is possible for a grievance procedure within a collective agreement applying to teachers, to facilitate in certain cases, the examination of questions which are intimately bound up with the salutary but delicate exercice of academic freedom ? Furthermore, is it far-fetched to think that, in certain cases, the workings of collective agreements concerning teachers could offer a concrete idea of the nature of academic freedom ? In our opinion, these are some of the unquestionably positive aspects of collective agreements that do not seem to receive their fair share of attention from the public to-day. 4 In this respect, it has often been argued that the ability of employees to transfer seniority-related rights and benefits from one bargaining unit to another would be encouraging a higher degree of labour mobility. It should indeed be borne in mind that an employee might think twice before moving to a better paid job and/or to a job more in line with his ability, if by moving, this employee would lose all seniority-related rights and benefits accumulated over the years.

However, in an environment where firms are financially constrained, as during a credit crunch, a well-designed STW scheme may help to increase welfare (Braun et al., 2011).

Corporations want to abolish the so-called early "bridge" pension, for employees who are collectively sacked; this proposal receives support from several political parties. It will not create jobs either. The reason why most enterprises continue to reduce their personnel, is the rise of productivity, together with the decline of sales, due to the economic crisis. Even the government support to corporations (amounting to billions of euro) does not induce hiring of personnel that is not needed. Public needs would justify government agencies to hire more personnel, but there is a widespread claim that the authorities should reduce spending. An other way to fight unemployment is {{to reduce the number of}} working hours; is Belgium this is already effective, as part of the anti-crisis measures (temporary unemployment, employees keep their contract).

40|$|The {{impact of}} the {{economic}} recession on employment {{is reflected in the}} information gleaned from social balance sheets filed for the year 2009. Staff numbers were down by 1. 2 p. c. compared with 31 December 2008, which is more than double the average annual decline. As evidence of the use that firms have made of the various flexibility instruments available to help reduce the volume of labour, part-time employment increased in 2009, at the expense of full-time jobs, mainly because of the shift from full-time work schedules towards shorter working hours. Job losses took a proportionally higher toll on men than on women, and manual workers have been affected more than employees or management staff. Large enterprises had to face more staff cuts than SMEs. Among the different branches of activity, job losses were the heaviest in industry, followed by the financial services and insurance sector. Some job creation was still observed in certain branches, including health and social work. Workers affected by <b>temporary</b> <b>lay-offs</b> for economic reasons and by the crisis measures remain on their employer’s staff register, which has tended to limit the drop in the number of workers in employment, while the volume of hours worked, which is directly influenced by these measures, felt considerably in 2009. Combined with this decline, the increase with 3. 8 p. c. of the average hourly labour costs led to an increase in staff costs of barely half a percentage point.

40|$|This {{in-depth}} study {{looked at a}} major manufacturing company during a year when management projected contract losses and massive lay-offs and terminations. The company's hourly employee culture indicated that the major automotive customers of the company were influential driving forces and would rescue the company from the dire management predictions. The principal major research question {{was to determine the}} accuracy of predictions based upon the company's hourly workers' culture versus management's predictions and actions based upon external sources. Another investigation area was the company management's actions to manifest their avowed "our employees are our most valuable resource and asset" belief statement. Similarly, would the Professional and Technician Equal Employment Opportunity job groups have the smallest percent of reduction, since the company's primary strength was purported to lie in its engineering and technical employees?Interviews, data collection and analysis, and monthly task force investigations and communications revealed the company culture was definitely more accurate than the numerous predictions made by management. As the "culture" predicted, the loss of the contracts did not occur. The company concluded the year with increases in total employment. <b>Temporary</b> <b>lay-offs</b> did occur during the year and management took numerous actions to help both retained employees and those being terminated or laid-off. Such actions included outplacement services, stress reduction programs, job placement and resume writing, and instituting communication networks and procedures and a Dispute Resolution Procedure. The company did show that the employees were valuable and important assets. The reduction numbers and percents for the Professionals (engineers) and Technicians were exactly opposite of what management typically avowed. The largest category reduced was the Technicians and the second-largest category was the Professionals. The company continued to be quite viable and the future outlook became optimistic, which coincides with the company culture that the major automotive customers will always be there needing the company's products. The company management took several steps to prevent their predictions from occurring, while hourly employees, using only history which is not a very dependable source for industry today, happened to be correct in this study. The primary conclusion was that the culture of the company's hourly workers was more accurate in predicting the future than management's predictions based on supposed knowledgeable external sources. It was recommended that internal cultural based predictions and externally based information be blended together for the most accurate predictions.

40|$|Economic {{growth in}} Austria is {{expected}} to slip by 1 percentage point to 2. 2 percent {{as a result of}} the sluggishness of the world economy. Private consumption, benefiting from the gains in purchasing power, will buoy economic activity in 1999 and, more strongly, in the year 2000. The year 1999 is likely to see a weakening of economic growth by 1 percentage point to 2. 2 percent. The crises in Asia, Russia, and Latin America have dampened the expansion of the world economy and render the present forecasts highly uncertain. Exports, which have long been the mainstay of the upswing, are expected to grow only modestly, given the adverse conditions in foreign markets. Particularly hard hit will be sales to emerging markets afflicted by the financial turmoil. In the current year, weak foreign demand will have a negative impact not only on Austrian exports but also on capital outlays of those enterprises operating in international markets. Economic activity in Austria continues to be supported by strong consumer spending which benefits from high real income gains. Real net wages and salaries are forecast to expand by 2 ¾ percent in the current year and by 3 ¼ percent in the year 2000, with part of the gains due to the "family package" and the tax reform 2000. The growth in real income will not only bolster consumer spending but also boost the savings ratio. Thus, the effects of the sluggishness of the world economy are being partially offset by a revival of domestic demand. If, however, new crises were to develop or present risks to materialise, a new setback in the manufacturing sector would also shake consumer confidence. On the downside, the costs of the tax reform and of the "family package" will burden the federal budget in the year 2000. An increase in the general government deficit to 2 ½ percent of GDP seems likely, unless strict discipline is applied to government expenditures. The goal of reducing the deficit of the public households to 1. 4 percent of GDP by the year 2002 is only feasible if this condition is met. In accordance with most international forecasting institutions, WIFO expects an acceleration in economic growth to 2. 6 percent in the year 2000. In this scenario, which at present is the most likely, the economic slump which began in the middle of 1998 proves to be only temporary. This forecast is based on the expectation that the weakness in exports will be gradually overcome and that low interest rates will boost domestic demand. The international risks which might justify a more pessimistic scenario remain substantial, however. Economic growth in Austria will probably not be strong enough to significantly reduce the unemployment rate. As the rise in the unemployment rate in 1998 was only due to special factors (parental leave regulations and the like), a slight decline from 4. 5 percent in 1998 to 4. 2 percent in 2000 can be expected; this moderation corresponds to a marked expansion in employment resulting from the advance in labour-intensive domestic demand. The medium-term employment goal of the National Action Plan (1997 - 2002 : + 100, 000 jobs) will be attained. The envisaged cut in the unemployment rate to 3. 5 percent by the year 2002 seems only feasible if economic growth holds up, and if the high number of <b>temporary</b> <b>lay-offs</b> can be reduced. Inflation does not present a problem for policy-makers for the foreseeable future. Thanks to lower prices of crude oil and the abolishment of monopolies in the public service sector, inflation is subdued and has reached a record low since 1955. This provides the European Central Bank enough leeway for easing monetary policy in the case of a serious economic setback. Growth to Slacken in 1999 – Tax Reform to Boost Domestic Demand in 2000.

40|$|This paper {{makes use}} of {{hitherto}} untabulated data from the censuses of manufacturing for 1870 and 1880 to investigate {{the extent to which}} firms operated at less than their full capacity year round in these census years and thus provides some evidence {{of the extent to which}} workers may have faced <b>temporary</b> or permanent <b>lay-off.</b> We conclude that firms nationwide operated for the equivalent of 254 days (out of, perhaps, 309 working days) during the 1870 census year from the end of May, 1869 to the beginning of June, 1870 and 261 days during the 1880 census year from the beginning of June 1879 to the end of May, 1880. Workers put in the equivalent of slightly more days of work in each of these years in their customary industrial employment because larger firms were more likely to operate for more days per year. There were, however, significant regional and industry differences. Although our estimates are broadly consistent with independent estimates and are generally in accord with expectations, they raise important questions about economic performance in the late nineteenth century which remain unanswered here. ...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{previous}} forecasts, {{there have been}} increasing signs of recovery, {{in the wake of}} the most severe recession suffered by the global economy in the last sixty years. Indicators show that confidence has returned since the spring, against a backdrop of easing financial tension, while industrial production and trade have both increased slightly worldwide. Doubts still remain, however, as to the sustainability of the recovery. This recovery has, in fact, largely been driven by budgetary and monetary policy stimulus, along with movements in inventories, the effects of which are temporary. In contrast, unemployment is likely to increase further in most of the advanced economies, with investment remaining low, and this will restrict growth in 2010. In Belgium, the sheer scale of the GDP decline at the end of 2008 and the start of 2009 was historic. However, GDP did rise by 0. 5 p. c. in the third quarter, and a revival in business cycle indicators suggests that the economy should continue to grow. The growth rate will remain low, however, given the absence of any vigorous recovery in foreign demand and the anticipated weakness of investment and private consumption, against the backdrop of a deteriorating labour market. GDP is thus set to contract by 3. 1 p. c. on average in 2009, before growing by 1 p. c. in 2010. The labour market initially showed a certain degree of resilience in the face of the severe contraction in activity. Job losses and increasing unemployment were contained by the massive use of <b>temporary</b> <b>lay-offs</b> and other methods of reducing working hours. They were also cushioned by a significant drop in company productivity. Employment is likely to fall by 118, 000 units between the end of 2008 and the end of 2010. As an annual average, net job losses are forecast at 27, 000 and 64, 000 persons respectively in 2009 and 2010. The unemployment rate is set to rise from 7 p. c. in 2008 to 9 p. c. in 2010. The deterioration in labour market conditions is expected to result in wage growth moderation. The combination of a severe financial crisis and a generalised decline in economic activity significantly affected both consumers and businesses in 2009. With the exception of public sector consumption and investment, all the main expenditure categories affected GDP negatively. Businesses had to face the synchronised collapse of most foreign markets, with exports contracting by more than 12 p. c. In addition, inventories were reduced significantly. Finally, businesses are likely to cut their investments, due to the unprecedented decline in their capacity utilisation rate in particular, along with modest demand prospects. Consumers are also likely to reign in their expenditure significantly in 2009, both in terms of consumption and investment in housing. This behaviour is largely an expression of great restraint in the face of uncertain prospects for jobs or future incomes. In 2010, the modest recovery in growth is likely to be based on a slight increase in private consumption and exports, and on a turnaround in inventory movements. Private investment adjustment is, however, likely to continue. As in the euro area, inflation in Belgium eased rapidly over the course of 2009, even turning negative from May to November, as a consequence of the significant fall in energy prices in comparison with {{the previous}} year. Due to the recent increase in international oil quotations, inflation is expected to return to positive figures at the end of 2009, though remaining low, owing to the rapid attenuation of pressure from import prices and wages. In all, as an annual average, inflation is expected to be 0 p. c. in 2009 and 1. 6 p. c. in 2010. In the macroeconomic context depicted above, and in the light of the measures approved by the authorities, e. g. in the budgetary context, the public deficit is expected to reach 6. 1 p. c. of GDP in 2009 and 5. 4 p. c. in 2010, if there is no change in policy. In 2009 and 2010, the general government debt is expected to record a further sharp rise, though the increase should be slightly lower than the average for the euro area, rising from 89. 8 p. c. of GDP in 2008 to 98. 1 p. c. in 2009 and 102 p. c. in 2010.

40|$|Since the {{previous}} forecasts {{were published in}} February 2009, the downturn in activity and international trade in late 2008 and early 2009 {{has proved to be}} even sharper than initially expected. An unprecedentedly deep recession has spread across the various economic regions of the world, requiring resolute action in the monetary and fiscal sphere. There are signs which suggest some stabilisation of both financial market conditions and business and consumer confidence. Nonetheless, the adjustments to be made to employment, investment and the position of financial institutions are likely to hamper the economic recovery. The sharp cyclical downturn in the euro area at the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 had a major impact on economic activity in Belgium. In particular, both industrial production and foreign trade in goods plummeted from October 2008. According to the national accounts data, real GDP was down by 1. 7 p. c. {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2008, falling by a further 1. 6 p. c. in the first quarter of 2009, the deepest recession since the Second World War. The decline in activity should decelerate sharply from the second quarter of 2009, and give way to a modest recovery in 2010. Thus, having grown by 1 p. c. in 2008, GDP is set to contract by 3. 5 p. c. on average in 2009 and by 0. 2 p. c. in 2010. In the face of the abrupt contraction in activity, firms reacted for example by reducing agency work and greatly increasing their use of <b>temporary</b> <b>lay-offs.</b> Such systems offer a provisional buffer against the effect on employment of fluctuations in production. However, taking account of the deep and sustained decline in activity, the number of persons employed is likely to decline progressively. As an annual average, net job losses are forecast at 36, 000 and 80, 000 persons respectively in 2009 and 2010. The unemployment rate is set to rise from 7 p. c. in 2008 to 9. 2 p. c. in 2010, reaching 9. 7 p. c. by the end of 2010. In 2009, all the main expenditure categories – domestic demand, change in stocks and net exports – are set to be seriously affected, directly or indirectly, by the recession in global demand and the repercussions of the global financial crisis; in 2010, their contribution to the change in GDP is forecast to be broadly neutral. Exports of goods and services are projected to record a very marked fall in 2009, following the collapse of foreign demand. They are likely to continue falling slightly in 2010. In the absence of support from domestic demand, the profile of imports is expected to mirror that of exports. Following the curb on growth in 2008 resulting from the stagnation of real disposable income in a context of rising inflation, private consumption is set to fall in 2009, mainly owing to the plunge in share prices and the deterioration in economic conditions and the labour market outlook, both these factors contributing to an increase in the savings rate. In the context of the decline in their capacity utilisation rate, gloomy forecasts for demand, the high cost of external financing and the reduction in the financial resources generated by their own activity, businesses are likely to cut their investment in 2009 and 2010, following more than four years of sustained vigour. Investment in housing is also set to fall in 2009 and 2010, continuing the slowdown which began in 2007. Having peaked at 5. 9 p. c. in July 2008, inflation in Belgium eased rapidly and should continue to fall in the short term, becoming negative for a time. This situation, likely to last only a few months, is due mainly to base effects connected with the record prices of petroleum products during the summer of 2008. Once these base effects have faded away, inflation is expected to return to positive figures at the end of 2009, though remaining low up to the end of the projection period, owing to the rapid attenuation of pressure from import prices and wages. In all, as an annual average, inflation is expected to reach 0. 1 p. c. in 2009 and 1. 3 p. c. in 2010, having stood at 4. 5 p. c. in 2008. The health index is projected to rise by 0. 8 p. c. in 2009 and 1. 1 p. c. in 2010. Reflecting both the fall in labour productivity, following the cyclical weakness, and the still sustained rise in hourly labour costs, unit labour costs in the private sector rose by 3. 9 p. c. in 2008 and are likely to rise by a further 2. 9 p. c. in 2009, as a result of high indexation which follows from the surge in inflation in 2008. In 2010, they should remain more or less steady. This deceleration between 2009 and 2010 is due partly to the cyclical recovery in labour productivity. Also, the growth of hourly labour costs is set to fall from 3. 5 p. c. in 2008 to 2. 3 p. c. in 2009 and 0. 4 p. c. in 2010. The deterioration in labour market conditions is expected to result in wage growth moderation. According to the provisional figures published by the NAI in March 2009, Belgium’s public finances recorded a deficit of 1. 2 p. c. of GDP in 2008. In the macroeconomic context depicted above and in the light of the measures approved by the federal government and the regional governments, e. g. in connection with the recovery plans, that deficit is expected to reach 5. 5 p. c. of GDP in 2009 and 6 p. c. in 2010, if policy remains unchanged. After having declined continuously since 1993, to reach 84 p. c. in 2007, the ratio of public debt to GDP began rising again in 2008, mainly as a result of the capital injections and loans granted to financial institutions. In 2009 and 2010, the general government debt is expected to record a further sharp rise to 97. 4 and 103 p. c. of GDP respectively. Belgium, macroeconomic projections, Eurosystem...|$|R
