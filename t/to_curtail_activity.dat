500|$|In 1944 Arch Ward, the {{influential}} sports {{editor of the}} Chicago Tribune, proposed a new professional football league called the All-America Football Conference. The AAFC was to challenge the dominant National Football League once it began operations {{at the end of}} World War II, which had forced many professional teams <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> <b>activity,</b> merge or go on hiatus as their players served in the U.S. military. It was a bold proposition, given the failure of three previous NFL competitors and the dominance of college football, which was more popular than the professional game at the time. Ward, who had gained fame and respect for starting all-star games for baseball and college football, lined up deep-pocketed owners for the new league's eight teams in hopes of giving it a better chance against the NFL. One of them was Arthur B. [...] "Mickey" [...] McBride, a Cleveland businessman who grew up in Chicago and knew Ward from his involvement in the newspaper business. McBride spent his early career as a circulation manager for the Cleveland News, and went into business for himself in the 1930s, buying [...] a pair of Cleveland taxi companies and running a wire service that supplied bookies with information about the results of horse races. He had connections to organized crime in Chicago and Cleveland arising from the wire service.|$|E

50|$|The Police Department, {{in spite}} of its desire <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> Pendergast's <b>activities,</b> must appear as though it's aiding the investigation, and so {{supplies}} a liaison officer, Patrick Murphy O'Shaughnessy.

5|$|Deane Malott, {{who became}} {{president}} of Cornell in 1951, was much less sympathetic, and instructed Morrison <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> all <b>activities</b> beyond his academic field.

25|$|Even {{before the}} {{blizzard}} hit, the Niagara Mohawk Power Company (which is now National Grid) had warned that snow was reaching the power lines {{in some areas}} of western New York. Also, on Thursday, January 27, severe natural gas shortages forced industries and schools <b>to</b> either <b>curtail</b> <b>activities</b> or <b>to</b> close. The governors of Minnesota, Tennessee, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey had also declared energy emergencies.|$|R
40|$|Energy input {{is never}} quite {{balanced}} with energy require-ments. When energy availability is plentiful, animals use mech-anisms that store energy for future use. When caloric demands {{are higher than}} the energy immediately available, there are trade-offs between various energy demands to reduce total en-ergy requirements (Wade and Schneider, 1992; Wade et al., 1996) (Fig. 1). The most common strategy to cope with urgent energy demands is <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> <b>activities</b> that are not essential to immediate survival, such as locomotor activity, reproduction or growth. During the winter, for example, many small mammals and birds inhibit breeding and growth, and allocate energy into thermogenesis or cellular maintenance. As energy shortages be-come more severe, survival may become compromised because processes such as immune function and thermogenesis are im-paired. Mechanisms have evolved that allow individuals t...|$|R

50|$|Raoul Charles de Thuin (1890-1975) was a {{prolific}} stamp forger and dealer who was originally {{a citizen of}} Belgium but who operated from Mérida, Yucatán, Mexico, of which country he eventually became a naturalised citizen.

50|$|In late 1889, Dubois-Pillet was {{transferred}} {{by the army}} to a post as commander of the gendarmerie in Le Puy-en-Velay, a south central French commune. His transfer {{may have been in}} response to his defying the orders <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> his artistic <b>activities.</b>|$|R
50|$|On {{a number}} of {{occasions}} in the ensuing seasons, the St. Cecilia Society offered balls as last-minute substitutes for concerts when a sufficient number of musicians could not be procured. Finally, the Panic of 1819 unraveled the local economy and induced the organization <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> its <b>activities.</b> After three increasingly meager seasons, the society held its last regular concert in the spring of 1820 and in subsequent years presented a greatly reduced number of balls.|$|R
5000|$|Costermongers {{experienced}} a turbulent history.

As highly visible, colourful characters who provided service and convenience to the labouring classes, costermongers enjoyed {{a high level of}} public sympathy at times when they came under attack from authorities.|$|R
50|$|Bistras was openly {{critical}} of the government during the period. In 1927, he was alleged to have influenced several military officers who attempted to force Smetona to form a coalition government. The intervention failed and Brisas fled Lithuania for Germany, only returning the following year. Starting with 1930, he, together with other Catholic leaders, criticized the government for their attempt <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> the <b>activities</b> of religious organizations and, in 1935, he openly criticized the government in {{a speech at the}} Global Lithuanian Congress.|$|R

50|$|In reply, {{the federal}} {{government}} restricted movement of the dam workers to Las Vegas. Smuggling and circuitous routes then were developed. In 1934, <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> these <b>activities</b> and the resulting growth of criminal figures in the gambling industry, the city's leading figures purged gambling dens and started an effort to stem the flow of workers from the dam. This only emboldened some dam workers who still contrived to visit Las Vegas. A celebration of this era {{has become known as}} Helldorado Days.|$|R

50|$|A {{revival of}} Irish {{traditional}} music took place {{around the turn}} of the 20th century, which included feiseanna, céilís and organised music competitions. Dancing and singing took place at well-known venues where local and itinerant musicians were welcome. An older style of singing called sean-nós ("in the old style"), which is a form of traditional Irish singing was still found, mainly for very poetic songs in the Irish language.

50|$|Early in {{her time}} on the West African coast Tigress was {{involved}} in {{an attack on the}} French colony in Senegal in July 1809, that aimed <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> the <b>activities</b> of privateers. The attack resulted in the capture of the colony, which remained in British hands until 1817. The expedition's success was bought at the cost of the loss to grounding of Solebay, though Solebays entire crew was saved. Tigress removed the stores from Solebay, and then cruises the senegambian coast for several months before sailing to the Canaries for supplies.|$|R
50|$|The populist Brazilian government's {{attitude}} towards the leagues varied over time from neutral to positive, while that {{of the military and}} police was uniformly negative. The armed forces in the Brazilian Northeast had many connections to wealthy landowners whose enterprises were threatened by the activities of the leagues, and they would go to extraordinary lengths <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> league <b>activity.</b> The Catholic Church established organizations in the Northeast which functioned similarly but were conservative and anti-communist in their outlook; these groups were crushed alongside the peasant leagues following the 1964 coup.|$|R

The WHO also introduced new measurement guidelines for very small particulates which are more dangerous to pulmonary function. At the '200' level, Hong Kong levels of SO2 (800μg/m3) and NO2 (1,130μg/m3) are 40 times and 5½ times WHO guidelines respectively; the equivalent for particulates (350μg/m3) is 7 times WHO guidelines.|$|R
