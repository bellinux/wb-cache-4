Normal operating temperature ranges are affected by several factors, such as the power dissipation of the device. These factors are used to define a [...] "threshold temperature" [...] of a device, i.e. its maximum normal operating temperature, and a maximum operating temperature beyond which the device will no longer function. Between these two temperatures, the device will operate at a non-peak level. For instance, a resistor may have a threshold temperature of 70 °C and a maximum temperature of 155 °C, between which it exhibits a <b>thermal</b> <b>derating.</b>|$|E

To achieve these benefits, however, extra {{care must be taken}} in selecting the appropriate system of pump, motor, and electronic motor driver of VFD for optimum interaction with the process system. Successful pump selection requires knowledge of the full anticipated range of heads, flows, and specific gravities. Motor selection requires appropriate <b>thermal</b> <b>derating</b> and, at times, a matching of the motor?s electrical characteristic to the VFD. VFD selection requires an understanding of the electronic technology employed to determine what effect the VFD may have on the mechanical aspects of the driven equipment train. Despite these extra design considerations, variable speed pumping is becoming well accepted and widespread. In a simple manner, a discussion is presented on how to identify the benefits that variable speed offers and how to select components for trouble free, reliable operation...|$|E
