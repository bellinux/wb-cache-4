50|$|<b>Tawing</b> is {{a method}} that uses alum and {{aluminium}} salts, generally {{in conjunction with other}} products such as egg yolk, flour, and other salts. The leather becomes tawed by soaking in a warm potash alum and salts solution, between 20 and 30 °C. The process increases the leather's pliability, stretchability, softness, and quality. Adding egg yolk and flour to the standard soaking solution further enhances its fine handling characteristics. Then, the leather is air dried (crusted) for several weeks, which allows it to stabilize. <b>Tawing</b> is traditionally used on pigskins and goatskins to create the whitest colors. However, exposure and aging may cause slight yellowing over time and, if it remains in a wet condition, tawed leather will suffer from decay. Technically, <b>tawing</b> is not tanning.|$|E

5000|$|Henry Burk {{was born}} in Knittlingen, Württemberg, Germany, son of David and Charlotte Reinman Burk; Henry was the fourth child of eight. David, a shoemaker, made the {{decision}} to leave Germany because of unacceptable political views. The family emigrated to the United States in 1854 and settled in Philadelphia, PA. Henry attended school only a few years, but then began to work to help his family; he was reputed to have a natural engineering ability. He became a repairer of shoemaking machinery and subsequently engaged in supplying this machinery to the trade. He was engaged in the manufacture of leather and in 1887 invented the alum and sumac <b>tawing</b> process, which revolutionized the tanning industry. The company he founded with his two brothers Alfred E. Burk and Charles D. Burk, Burk Brothers and Company, is now listed as a Registered Historic Place. He also helped to establish a meat packing company in Philadelphia with the same brothers and two others, William and Louis; this company was known variously as Burk Meats and Louis Burk & Co. ("Burk's Franks" [...] were known throughout the Delaware Valley well into the 1950s). He became president of the Manufacturers’ National Association in 1895. He travelled around the world for his leather business, from Europe—visiting his birthplace in 1894—to India.|$|E

40|$|VII. Conclusion These {{preliminary}} {{results suggest that}} XRF can rapidly, effectively, and nondestructively identify chrome tanned leathers, since it can readily detect chromium ions, and lacks the dependence on binding strength that tends to make microchemical spot tests unreliable. Results are clear with modern specimens; lesser amounts of chromium detected in older leathers {{may be due to}} different thickness/density of the leathers, historical changes in tanning processes, or to retanning with other methods. The spectra also showed other elements that potentially provide useful information on how both modern and historic leather artifacts were processed. VIII. Further Research Further analysis of leather objects dating from the 1890 s onward would confirm the effectiveness of XRF in identifying chrome tanning, as well as shed light on various factors that may affect the levels of chromium detected in the leather, such as thickness/density, changes in the chrome tanning manufacturing process, the use of combination tannages, or the possible presence of other chromium-containing compounds, for instance colorants, used in the finishing process. Investigating the efficacy of a vacuum chamber-based or helium flow XRF technique to detect aluminum would also be important, as chrome tanning was primarily used at first to imitate kid leathers traditionally produced by alum <b>tawing.</b> Many of the 20 th century kid leather objects present in museum collections may have been produced via chrome tanning alone or in combination with alum <b>tawing</b> or even a pale vegetable tanning, and knowing these differences would allow these objects to be put in a clearer historical and technological context. Finally, future experiments should include the development of reference standards for quantitative XRF so that the minimum detection limits for this type of analysis can be determined...|$|E

The first aim of this analysis is to quantify the wage penalty, if any, for workers in <b>TAW.</b> Secondly, we analyze the wage profile of workers before and after spells of <b>TAW.</b> Linked employer-employee data for Portugal enable us to account for observable as well as unobservable worker quality. Our results show that workers in <b>TAW</b> earn lower wages than their peers and that this difference is mostly due to the workers' characteristics. We estimate that workers in <b>TAW</b> earn on average 9 % less than comparable workers {{in the rest of the}} economy if we control for the workers' observable attributes only; this difference is reduced to 1 % when we control for unobservable characteristics as well. However, interesting differences emerge across groups. Younger workers, both men and women, earn higher wages in <b>TAW</b> than their peers in other firms, as opposed to prime-age and older workers. Moreover, for young workers <b>TAW</b> is not associated with a stigma effect that slows wage progression after working for <b>TAW,</b> contrary to prime-age and older workers, in particular males. The wage trends are also different before entering <b>TAW.</b> Prime-age and older workers see their wages deteriorate relative to their peers before entering <b>TAW,</b> suggesting that adverse labor market conditions may motivate them to search for a <b>TAW</b> job.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} a protocol with a higher number of viable oocytes after the vitrification procedure. The oocytes were collected by the follicular punction method from swine prepuberal ovaries. A total of 1792 immature oocytes were cryopreserved stepwise in previtrification (PV) and vitrification (VM) media, containing ethylene glycol (EG) permeating agent, combined with trehalose a non-permeating agent. The cells were preserved in three experimental ways, with three different concentration of cryoprotectant in the VM respectively 30, 40 and 45 % EG. The exposure time of the cells to the cryoprotectants was the same in each experimental design, 4 minutes in the PV and 40 seconds in the VM. The concentration of the trehalose and the EG in the PM were remained the same. The vitrification procedure was performed by the superfine open pull straw method.

40|$|In recent years, {{the growth}} in the {{temporary}} agency industry has been tremendous – irrespective of the level of employment protection legislation (EPL). For example, both Germany and Switzerland – the former known as a country with a rather high level of EPL, the latter rather known as a low EPL-level country – have witnessed a growth of 10 % p. a. in the number of temporary agency workers (<b>TAWs)</b> over the past 10 years. We refer to temporary work as the triangular relationship between a <b>TAW,</b> a temporary work agency and a client firm borrowing the <b>TAW</b> from the agency. There are two main reasons why client firms hire TAWs: flexibility and screening. Firms can use <b>TAWs</b> to meet short-term fluctuations in demand, i. e. to enhance their flexibility (Boockmann/Hagen 2001). In this case, <b>TAWs</b> serve as a buffer allowing short-term employment adjustments without affecting permanent employees (Booth/Francesconi/Frank 2002 b). Firms can also use <b>TAWs</b> to screen workers before hiring them on a permanent basis (Pfeifer 2006). In that case, firms signal a long-term interest to <b>TAWs,</b> because temporary work may be a stepping stone for <b>TAWs</b> into permanent employment (Barbieri/Sestito 2008...|$|R

40|$|We {{employ the}} generic three-wave system, with the χ ^(2) {{interaction}} between two {{components of the}} fundamental-frequency (FF) wave and second-harmonic (SH) one, to consider collisions of truncated Airy waves (<b>TAWs)</b> and three-wave solitons in a setting which is not available in other nonlinear systems. The advantage is that the single-wave <b>TAWs,</b> carried by either one of the FF component, are not distorted by the nonlinearity and are stable, three-wave solitons being stable too in the same system. The collision between mutually symmetric <b>TAWs,</b> carried by the different FF components, transforms them into a set of solitons, the number of which decreases {{with the increase of}} the total power.

40|$|Abstract: 8 -p-Hdroxybenzoyl tovarol (<b>TAW)</b> is a germacrane-type sesquiterpenoid {{that can}} be {{isolated}} from the roots of Ferula dissecta (Ledeb.) Ledeb. In this study, the growth inhibitory effects induced by <b>TAW</b> were screened on some types of tumor cells, and the mechanism was investigated on TAW-induced growth inhibition, including paraptosis and autophagy in human cervical cancer HeLa cells. TAW-induced paraptosis involved extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization {{in the absence of}} caspase activation. Additionally, <b>TAW</b> evoked cell paraptotic death mediated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR). Autophagy induced by <b>TAW</b> was found to antagonize paraptosis in HeLa cells. This effect was enhanced by rapamycin and suppressed by the autophagy inhibitor, 3 -methyladenine (3 MA). Loss of beclin 1 (an autophagic regulator) function led to promote ER stress.
