5|$|GR is {{the better}} known of the two romanization systems which {{indicate}} the four <b>tones</b> of Mandarin by varying the spelling of syllables ("tonal spelling"). These <b>tones</b> are as fundamental to the Chinese language as vowels are to English; their presence lets speakers discriminate between otherwise identical syllables and words. Other systems indicate the <b>tones</b> with either diacritics (for example Pinyin: āi, ái, ǎi and ài) or numbers (Wade–Giles: ai1, ai2, etc.). GR spells the same four <b>tones</b> ai, air, ae and ay. These spellings, which follow specific rules, indicate the <b>tones</b> while retaining the pronunciation of the syllable ai.|$|E

50|$|The <b>tone</b> {{contours}} of the Sichuanese dialects are highly and quite {{different from those of}} Beijing Mandarin. In Sichuanese, the first <b>tone</b> (dark level <b>tone)</b> is a high level <b>tone</b> (like Beijing), the second <b>tone</b> (light level <b>tone)</b> is a low falling <b>tone</b> (the mirror image of Beijing), the third <b>tone</b> (rising <b>tone)</b> is a high falling <b>tone</b> and the fourth <b>tone</b> (departing <b>tone)</b> is a low or mid rising <b>tone</b> (interchanged compared to Beijing) and the fifth <b>tone</b> (entering <b>tone)</b> is mid or high if it's not merged, as shown in the chart below.|$|R
5000|$|Consider the {{intervals}} {{of the major}} scale: <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> semitone, <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> semitone. Starting the scale on a different degree will always create a new mode with individual interval layouts—for example starting on the second degree of a major scale gives the [...] "Dorian mode"—tone, semitone, <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> semitone, <b>tone.</b> This is not so of the modes of limited transposition, which can be modally shifted {{only a limited number}} of times. For example, mode 1, the whole <b>tone</b> scale, contains {{the intervals}} <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>tone.</b> Starting on any degree of the mode gives the same sequence of intervals, and therefore the whole <b>tone</b> scale has only 1 mode. Messiaen's mode 2, or the diminished scale, consists of semitone, <b>tone,</b> semitone, <b>tone,</b> semitone, <b>tone,</b> semitone, <b>tone,</b> which can be arranged only 2 ways, starting with either a <b>tone</b> or a semitone. Therefore mode 2 has two modes.|$|R

5|$|A {{few times}} during the film, a loud, ringing tone evocative of {{tinnitus}} is heard. This sound generally coincides {{with the death of}} a major character (Julian, Jasper) and is referred to by Julian herself, who describes the <b>tones</b> as the last time you'll ever hear that frequency. In this way, then, the loss of the <b>tones</b> is symbolic of the loss of the characters.|$|E
5|$|Any {{stressed}} syllable carries {{one of two}} <b>tones,</b> {{which give}} Swedish much of its characteristic sound. Prosody is often {{one of the most}} noticeable differences between its dialects.|$|E
5|$|Like most Southeast Asian languages, {{including}} Tai and {{the varieties}} of Chinese, E is tonal. The language is described as having seven <b>tones,</b> with the seventh varying allophonically with {{the length of the}} vowel it is attached to. With numbers ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest tone and 5 the highest, the contours of the various <b>tones</b> in E are as follows.|$|E
50|$|When <b>Tone</b> No.1 meets another <b>Tone</b> No.1 or <b>Tone</b> No.4 meets <b>Tone</b> No.1, {{usually the}} {{previous}} <b>tone</b> turns to <b>Tone</b> No.5 {{and the next}} <b>tone</b> doesn't change, like “家家戶戶”jia'r5-jia'r1-hur6-hur4, “駕崩”jia5-beng1.|$|R
50|$|When <b>Tone</b> No.4 meets another <b>Tone</b> No.4, {{usually the}} {{previous}} <b>tone</b> turns to <b>Tone</b> No.5 {{and the next}} <b>tone</b> turns to <b>Tone</b> No.6, like “畢恭畢敬”bi5-gongr1-bi5-jingr6, “客客氣氣”ke'r4-ke'r-qi5-qi6.|$|R

5|$|Strongly {{influenced}} by the works of Titian and Rubens, Etty became famous for painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. He became well-respected {{for his ability to}} capture flesh <b>tones</b> accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin <b>tones.</b> Many of his peers greatly admired his work, and in February 1828 he defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist.|$|E

5|$|In 1821 the Royal Academy {{accepted}} and exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra), which depicted {{a large number}} of nude figures. Cleopatra was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh <b>tones</b> accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin <b>tones.</b> Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, over the next decade Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 included nude figures.|$|E

50|$|Selenium <b>toning</b> is {{a popular}} archival <b>toning</b> process, {{converting}} metallic silver to silver selenide. In a diluted <b>toning</b> solution, selenium <b>toning</b> gives a red-brown <b>tone,</b> while a strong solution gives a purple-brown <b>tone.</b> The change in color depends upon the chemical make-up of the photographic emulsion being <b>toned.</b> Chloro-bromide papers change dramatically, whilst pure bromide papers change little. Fibre-based papers are more responsive to selenium <b>toning.</b>|$|R
5|$|India {{experienced}} similar {{development to}} China in the Middle Ages; however, stringed instruments developed differently as they accommodated {{different styles of}} music. While stringed instruments of China were designed to produce precise <b>tones</b> capable of matching the <b>tones</b> of chimes, stringed instruments of India were considerably more flexible. This flexibility suited the slides and tremolos of Hindu music. Rhythm was of paramount importance in Indian music of the time, {{as evidenced by the}} frequent depiction of drums in reliefs dating to the Middle Ages. The emphasis on rhythm is an aspect native to Indian music. Historians divide the development of musical instruments in medieval India between pre-Islamic and Islamic periods due to the different influence each period provided.|$|E
5|$|Kepler {{began by}} {{exploring}} regular polygons and regular solids, including the figures {{that would come}} to be known as Kepler's solids. From there, he extended his harmonic analysis to music, meteorology, and astrology; harmony resulted from the <b>tones</b> made by the souls of heavenly bodies—and in the case of astrology, the interaction between those <b>tones</b> and human souls. In the final portion of the work (Book V), Kepler dealt with planetary motions, especially relationships between orbital velocity and orbital distance from the Sun. Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers, but Kepler—with Tycho's data and his own astronomical theories—treated them much more precisely and attached new physical significance to them.|$|E
5|$|Mathematics {{were also}} used in musical tuning and music theory. The 2nd-century-BCE Huainanzi, {{compiled}} by eight scholars under the patronage of King Liu An (179–122 BCE), outlined the use of twelve <b>tones</b> on a musical scale. Jing Fang (78–37 BCE), a mathematician and music theorist, expanded these to create a scale of 60 <b>tones.</b> While doing so, Jing Fang realized that 53 just fifths is approximate to 31 octaves. By calculating the difference at 177147⁄176776, Jing reached the same value of 53 equal temperament duly discovered by the German mathematician Nicholas Mercator (1620–1687) (i.e. 353/284, known as Mercator's comma). Later, the prince Zhu Zaiyu (1536–1611 CE) in Ming China and Simon Stevin (1548–1620 CE) of the Flemish Region in Europe would simultaneously (but separately) discover the mathematical formula for equal temperament.|$|E

5|$|Stern shot Changeling in {{anamorphic}} format on {{35mm film}} using Kodak Vision 500T 5279 film stock. The film was shot on Panavision cameras and C-Series lenses. Due {{to the large}} number of sets, the lighting rigs were more extensive than on other Eastwood productions. The crew made several ceilings from bleached muslin tiles. Stern lit the tiles from above to produce a soft, warm light that was intended to evoke the period through <b>tones</b> close to antique and sepia. The crew segregated the tiles using fire safety fabric Duvatyn to prevent light spilling onto neighboring clusters. The key light was generally softer to match the warm <b>tones</b> given off by the toplights. Stern used stronger skypans—more intense than is commonly used for key lighting—to reduce contrasts when applying daytime rain effects, as a single light source tended to produce harder shadows.|$|E
5|$|The 1883 Hill and Son organ, {{including}} 844 pipes, costing a {{total of}} £550, was installed in 1884, and located in the north-east corner of the transept.
