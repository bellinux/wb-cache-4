Based on {{the bucket}} <b>teeth</b> load-time <b>courses</b> {{calculation}} model under bucket digging condition, the stresses on the hydraulic cylinder piston rods of boom and bucket and the real-time length of bucket hydraulic cylinder were set as measured variables, and a measuring method of the bucket <b>teeth</b> load-time <b>courses</b> was developed {{which had the}} advantages of less measuring points, simplified measurement process and low cost. The bucket <b>teeth</b> load-time <b>courses</b> were calculated by inputting the measuring data into the self-developed Constructing Hydraulic Excavators Load Spectrum software, and its characteristics of each digging step in one excavation cycle at digging macadam were analyzed. Then, using rain-flow counting module in FE-SAFE software, the statistical graphs of bucket <b>teeth</b> load-time <b>courses</b> were acquired which could {{provide the basis for}} hydraulic excavator reliability design and fatigue life prediction...|$|R

40|$|More {{and more}} people choose to replace missing teeth with dental implants. This product has given us revolutionary changes in the dentists' world, where {{patients}} are given a permanent solution without involving other <b>teeth.</b> Assumption of <b>course</b> {{is that you have}} enough bone to anchor the implant. Many implants have succeeded, but some have failed. After some years of experience with implants, we face a new challenge; peri-implantitis. This is a growing problem around implants which, at worse, can result in the loss of the implant itself and the bone it sits in. Peri-implantitis is an inflammatory process affecting the tissues surrounding an implant, leading to loss of supporting tissue. It is caused by bacteria which organize themselves in a biofilm, a word often associated with dental plaque. We can define biofilm as a microbial community, enveloped by self-produced extracellular biopolymers. Biofilms may cause fouling of surfaces, clogging of pipes, and contribute to many forms of human diseases (Costerton et al., 1999) ...|$|R

50|$|Orthodontia is the {{specialty}} of dentistry that {{is concerned with}} the treatment of improper bites and crooked teeth. Orthodontic treatment can help fix the patient's teeth and set them in the right place. Orthodontists usually use braces and clear aligners to set the patient's teeth. Orthodontists work on reconstructing the entire face rather than focusing only on <b>teeth.</b> After a <b>course</b> of active orthodontic treatment, patients will typically wear retainers (orthodontic devices), which help to maintain the teeth in their improved positions while surrounding bone reforms around them. The retainers are generally worn full-time for a period, anywhere from just a few days to a year, then part-time (typically, nightly during sleep) {{for as long as the}} orthodontist recommends. It is possible for the teeth to stay aligned without regular retainer wear. However, there are many reasons teeth will crowd as a person ages, whether or not the individual ever experienced orthodontic treatment; thus there is no guarantee that teeth will stay aligned without retention. For this reason, many orthodontists prescribe night-time or part-time retainer wear for many years after orthodontic treatment (potentially for life). Adult orthodontic patients are more likely to need lifetime retention.|$|R
60|$|I have never, to my knowledge, {{seen the}} man through the wall, for his door is round the corner, and, besides, I have no {{interest}} in him until half-past eleven P.M. We begin then. I know him chiefly by his pipes, and them I know by his taps on the wall as he knocks the ashes out of them. He does not smoke the Arcadia, for his temper is hasty, and he breaks the coals with his foot. Though I am compelled to say that I do not consider his character very lovable, he has his good points, and I like his attachment to his brier. He scrapes it, on the whole, a little roughly, but that is because he is so anxious to light up again, and I discovered long ago that he has signed an agreement with his wife to go to bed at half-past twelve. For some time I could not understand why he had a silver rim put on the bowl. I noticed the change in the tap at once, and the natural conclusion would have been that the bowl had cracked. But it never had the tap of a cracked bowl. I was reluctant to believe that the man through the wall was merely some vulgar fellow, and I felt that he could not be so, or else he would have smoked his meerschaum more. At last I understood. The bowl had worn away on one side, and the silver rim had been needed to keep the tobacco in. Undoubtedly this was the explanation, for even before the rim came I was a little puzzled by the taps of the brier. He never seemed to hit the wall with the whole mouth of the bowl, but of course the reason was that he could not. At the same time I do not exonerate him from blame. He is a clumsy smoker to burn his bowl at one side, and I am afraid he lets the stem slip round in his <b>teeth.</b> Of <b>course,</b> I see that the mouth-piece is loose, but a piece of blotting-paper would remedy that.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To analyse tooth {{loss and}} to {{evaluate}} the longevity of healthy teeth and teeth compromised by diseases and influenced by therapy {{as well as that}} of oral implants. Material and methods: On the basis of an electronic and manual search using key words for survival, success, longevity of teeth, longevity of implants, epidemiology, periodontally compromised, endodontically compromised, risk for tooth extraction 49 full-text articles were identified to construct a traditional review. Among these, six systematic reviews addressing longevity were found. Results: Tooth loss is a complex outcome, it is influenced by the extent of dental caries and its sequelae and/or the presence or absence of periodontitis as well as the decisions taken by dentists when evaluating possible risk factors for rendering successful therapy. In addition, tooth loss is related to behavioural and socio-economic factors and associated morbidity and cultural priorities. Generally, teeth surrounded by healthy periodontal tissues yield a very high longevity (up to 99. 5 % over 50 years). If periodontally compromised, but treated and maintained regularly, the survival of such teeth is still very high (92 - 93 %). Likewise, endodontically compromised, but successfully treated devital teeth yield high survival and success rates. The survival of oral implants after 10 years varies between 82 % and 94 %. Conclusions: Teeth will last for life, unless they are affected by oral diseases or service interventions. Many retained teeth thus may be an indicator of positive oral health behaviour throughout the life <b>course.</b> <b>Tooth</b> longevity is largely dependent on the health status of the periodontium, the pulp or periapical region and the extent of reconstructions. Multiple risks lead to a critical appraisal of the value of a tooth. Oral implants when evaluated after 10 years of service do not surpass the longevity of even compromised but successfully treated natural teeth. © 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Tooth shade {{differentiation}} {{concerns the}} identification and classification of tooth shades. The objective of this project was to implement the Clinical <b>Tooth</b> Shade Differentiation <b>Course</b> in the preclinical stage of studies and to evaluate the students' perspective {{over a period of}} 3 years. Methodology: The course is planned for a duration of 10 weeks with two 45 -minute sessions per semester week. The entire attendance time was 10 : 15 h. 2 lectures of 90 minutes each, 2 seminars of 60 min each and 2 teaching units with the phantom head and role playing took place. In addition to the various parameters of tooth shade, changes in tooth shade and the basics of dental esthetics, clinical procedures for manual and digital tooth shade determination were explained and practiced. 96 % (69 of 72) of the students participated in the first evaluation in 2012 / 2013 (T), and 68 % of these were women. In the following year, 2013 / 2014 (T), 92 % (45 of 48 students) took part; 62 % of these were women and 38 % men. The 2014 / 2015 evaluation (T) comprised 94 % (45 of 48 students). Of these, 67 % were women. Results: In the evaluation, the students gave the course a positive grade. The questions in "General/Organization" were given a mean (M) of 1. 5 (SD= 0. 7) in T and T, and 1. 2 (SD= 0. 3) in T. The "Overall Assessment" yielded M= 1. 6 (SD= 0. 6), M= 1. 5 (SD= 0. 5) and M= 1. 1 (SD= 0. 3). In T and T, the item "The instructor actively involved the students in the course" was given a mean of 2. 1 (SD= 0. 9), and in T a mean of 1. 2 (SD= 0. 5). Conclusions: The course presented here conceptually shows how practical dental skills can be taught in a theoretical and clinical context. Educational objectives from the role of a dental expert were taken from the national competence-based catalog of educational objectives for dentistry and can also be supplemented. The objectives can be transferred to other dental faculties...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, the use of {{wearable}} devices has increased dramatically, primarily for fitness monitoring, largely due to their greater sensor reliability, increased functionality, smaller size, increased ease of use, and greater affordability. These devices have helped many {{people of all ages}} live healthier lives and achieve their personal fitness goals, as they are able to see quantifiable and graphical results of their efforts {{every step of the way}} (i. e. in real-time). Yet, while these device systems work well within the fitness domain, they have yet to achieve a convincing level of functionality in the larger domain of healthcare. As an example, according to the Alzheimer?s Association, there are currently approximately 5. 5 million Americans with Alzheimer?s Disease and approximately 5. 3 million of them are over the age of 65, comprising 10 % of this age group in the U. S. The economic toll of this disease is estimated to be around $ 259 billion. By 2050 the number of Americans with Alzheimer?s disease is predicted to reach around 16 million with an economic toll of over $ 1 trillion. There are other prevalent and chronic health conditions that are critically important to monitor, such as diabetes, complications from obesity, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among others. The goal of this research is to explore and develop accurate and quantifiable sensing and machine learning techniques for eventual real-time health monitoring by wearable device systems. To that end, a two-tier recognition system is presented that is designed to identify health activities in a naturalistic setting based on accelerometer data of common activities. In Tier I a traditional activity recognition approach is employed to classify short windows of data, while in Tier II these classified windows are grouped to identify instances of a specific activity. Everyday activities that were explored in this research include brushing one?s teeth, combing one?s hair, scratching one?s chin, washing one?s hands, taking medication, and drinking. Results show that an F-measure of 0. 83 is achievable when identifying these activities from each other and an F-measure of 0. 82 is achievable when identifying instances of brushing <b>teeth</b> over the <b>course</b> of a day...|$|R
40|$|A {{problem to}} measure the teeth wear of {{rotating}} gear wheels and a possibility to create simple, reliable and inexpensive mobile systems of diagnostics allowing to record the wear {{in the course of}} use are presently relevant. The paper presents implemented technical solutions as a result of work. The aim of the work was to prove experimentally that it is possible {{to measure the}} teeth wear of a gear wheel using a passive inductive sensor and a positioning disk. The technique to determine the wear uses a phase-chronometric method developed at BMSTU. To reach the objective, an experimental installation was designed and made. Works are performed, and experimental results of used stationary inductive sensors of passive type to measure the ferromagnetic gear wheels wear of reducers in use are received. The technique for defining the points at the output signal of the inductive sensor, which correspond to the specified points of the tooth profile and, in particular, to the profile points on a pitch circle of the tooth of gear wheel has been developed. Experiments allowed us to define the main dependences of signal parameters on the sizes and arrangement of the sensor magnet with respect to the passing <b>tooth</b> in the <b>course</b> of rotation, as well as on the number of the sensor coil turns, speed of gear wheel rotation, and on the gap size between the end face of the sensor and the top of a tooth. The technique for positioning the sensor with respect to tooth has been deve loped. In particular, it allows us to position a sensor at any point of the involute, including also a point of the profile on a pitch circle. This is necessary to adjust the sensor. The conducted researches allowed us to develop a technique for exact measuring system adjustment to a hitch circle of the gear wheel and to develop for this purpose a system of diagnostics and measurement of teeth wear with the wheel being rotated. The results of work performed at the JSC ELARA in Cheboksary city allowed us to develop a design and make a pilot batch of standard ind uctive sensors, which can be used in mechanical engineering in systems of diagnostics of reducers in a diversity of machines and mechanisms. </p...|$|R
