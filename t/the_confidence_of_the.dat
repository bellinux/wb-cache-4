5|$|Harper's Cabinet was {{defeated}} in a no-confidence vote on March 25, 2011, after being found in contempt of parliament. Harper thus, in accordance with constitutional convention, advised the Governor General to call a general election.

5|$|The 2003–04 {{season was}} {{difficult}} for the club, and Gordon Strachan resigned in March. Higginbotham felt that his replacement, Paul Sturrock, was unable to handle the pressure at St Mary's, but denied press rumours that Sturrock had lost <b>the</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> players. Steve Wigley took charge for 2004–05 and the club's decline continued. Wigley demoted Higginbotham to the reserves after following a falling out between the pair, though he soon reversed the decision and returned him to the first team. Harry Redknapp replaced Wigley as manager in December2004 but failed to arrest the decline, and Southampton were relegated in last place. Higginbotham had scored the equalising goal in the penultimate match of the season at Crystal Palace, but a final day defeat to Manchester United left Southampton two points from safety.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Magnano on 5 April 1799 {{resulted}} in a French defeat. In the fighting Sérurier's division included three battalions each of the 18th, 29th and 30th Light Infantry Demi brigades, one battalion of the 1st Light, 180 grenadiers, 850 cavalry and 60 gunners. Both armies advanced, Sérurier successfully capturing Villafranca on the left. However, the divisions of Claude Perrin Victor and Paul Grenier were routed on the right. The French lost 7,000–8,000 men, seven colors and eight cannons, while Kray's army sustained 5,228 casualties. The worst casualty was <b>the</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French generals and {{the morale of the}} troops. When Schérer found that 12,000 Austrians were marching from the County of Tyrol to turn his north flank, he withdrew from the line of the Mincio, leaving 12,000 soldiers to defend Mantua. During the retreat many Italian and Swiss allies deserted from the Army of Italy.|$|E
5|$|The Chief Minister of Karnataka is {{the chief}} {{executive}} of the south Indian state of Karnataka. As per the Constitution of India, the governor is a state's de jure head, but de facto executive authority rests with the chief minister. Following elections to the Karnataka Legislative Assembly, the state's governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the government. The governor appoints the chief minister, whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly. Given that he has <b>the</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assembly, the chief minister's term is for five years and is subject to no term limits.|$|E
5|$|The Prime Minister of Canada is an {{official}} {{who serves as}} the primary minister of the Crown, chair of the Cabinet, and thus head of government of Canada. Officially, the prime minister is appointed by the Governor General of Canada, but by constitutional convention, the prime minister must have <b>the</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elected House of Commons. Normally, this {{is the leader of}} the party caucus with the greatest number of seats in the house. But, if that leader lacks support of the majority, the governor general can appoint another leader who has that support or may dissolve parliament and call a new election. By constitutional convention, a prime minister holds a seat in parliament and, since the early 20th century, this has more specifically meant the House of Commons.|$|E

5|$|The {{province}} has a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, {{in which}} the Premier {{is the leader of}} the party that controls the most seats in the House of Assembly. The Premier is Newfoundland and Labrador's head of government, and the Queen of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador. The Premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of Newfoundland and Labrador, and presides over that body. Members are first elected to the House during general elections. General elections must be conducted every four years from the date of the last election. An election may also take place if the governing party loses <b>the</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legislature by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion.|$|E
5|$|To {{become law}} or bill, a {{constitutional}} amendment {{had to have the}} assent of both the Diet and the Emperor. This meant that while the Emperor could no longer legislate by decree he still had a veto over the Diet. The Emperor also had complete freedom in choosing the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, and so, under the Meiji constitution, Prime Ministers often were not chosen from and did not enjoy <b>the</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Diet. The Imperial Diet was also limited in its control over the budget. While the Diet could veto the annual budget, if no budget was approved the budget of the previous year continued in force. This all changed with the new constitution after World War II.|$|E
5|$|Before the mid-1870s, the {{judicial}} system of the Orange Free State was rather amateurish and haphazard in character, particularly {{because most of the}} judges were legally unqualified. Most of {{the judicial}} procedures were in the hands of district magistrates, the so-called Landdrosts, whose main task was administrative. Reitz's first task was to ameliorate this situation, which he did with much vigour. Well within his first year of tenure the Volksraad passed an Ordinance, in which both a professional Circuit Court and a Supreme Court were called into being. Reitz became the first president of the Supreme Court and consequently also the first Chief Justice of the Orange Free State. Right from the beginning Reitz showed himself to be a fighter, opposing the Volksraad on more than one occasion, tackling deeply ingrained political traditions that stood {{in the way of the}} modernisation of {{the judicial system}}, but also fighting hard to get the salaries and pensions of state officials improved. As a colonial – he was born in the Cape Colony after all – he had to win <b>the</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Boer population to have his ideas accepted. This he did by travelling with the Circuit Court through the country for over ten years, acquiring insight into and empathy for their way of life and their often conservative and always God-fearing beliefs. It helped that Reitz himself was a religious person and that he had started out in life in the Afrikaans speaking countryside of the Cape Colony. Eventually he became the symbol of Afrikanerdom for many Orange Free Staters.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though his}} father {{was a member of the}} Conservative Party, Muñoz Rivera decided to follow his uncle, Vicente Muñoz Barrios ideals and in 1883 joined the Liberal Party. While working within the organization, Muñoz Rivera {{established}} a store along Quintín Negrón Sanjurjo, which had limited success. He gained <b>the</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Liberal Party and was named president of Barranquitas' committee and became a member of the municipal council. In 1885, Muñoz Rivera ran for a position in the Juana Diaz district's representation in the Provincial Assembly, but he was not elected. That same year, he began publishing his writings in newspapers and magazines, including El Clamor del Pueblo, La Revista de Puerto Rico and El Pueblo. Other poems published by Muñoz Rivera were: Retamas, Tropicales, Horas de Fiebre, El paso del déspota, Minha terra, Cuba rebelde, A cualquier compatriota, Las campanas, Turba multa, Alea jacta est, Judas, El general, Abismos, Patriota, Himno, Parias and Poemas Liricos.|$|E
5|$|Joan of Arc {{puts the}} player {{in command of}} the battered, bloodied and demoralised French during the Hundred Years War against England. At the {{beginning}} of the campaign, nearly every major and decisive battle fought by the French has always led to defeat to the English. In France's darkest hour though, a seventeen-year-old girl—Joan of Arc intends to save France by the command of God. She intends to drive the English from France forever. Her presence at the Siege of Orleans earns her the nickname 'The Maid of Orleans', and she earns <b>the</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uncrowned Dauphin Charles VII by being given command of the entire French Army, although the Dauphin's advisors begin to plot against Joan of Arc. At several turning points in the Hundred Years' War, namely the Loire Campaign where the entire English and Burgundian forces were cleared out, hope for a free France begin to inspire more men to join the fight under Joan of Arc.|$|E

Circulated in the country, the document's subscribers swore that, should Elizabeth be assassinated (as William the Silent {{had been a}} few months earlier), not only the killer but also the royal person who would benefit from this should be executed. Leicester's relations with James of Scotland grew closer when he gained <b>the</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King's favourite, Patrick, Master of Gray, in 1584–1585. His negotiations with the Master were {{the basis for the}} Treaty of Berwick, a defensive alliance between the two British states against European powers. In 1586 Walsingham uncovered the Babington Plot. Following the Ridolfi Plot (1571) and the Throckmorton Plot (1583), this was another scheme to assassinate Elizabeth in which Mary Stuart was involved. Following her conviction, Leicester, then in the Netherlands, vehemently urged her execution in his letters; he despaired of Elizabeth's security after so many plots.|$|E
