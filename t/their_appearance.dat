Slipknot also canceled their remaining dates on the tour due to Jordison's health, promising to reschedule the first two dates.|$|E

5|$|Galaxies come {{in three}} main types: ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars. A {{slightly}} more extensive description of galaxy types based on <b>their</b> <b>appearance</b> {{is given by}} the Hubble sequence. Since the Hubble sequence is entirely based upon visual morphological type (shape), it may miss certain important characteristics of galaxies such as star formation rate in starburst galaxies and activity in the cores of active galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Just as predators such as {{angler fish}} have a {{structure}} that lures prey, so some parasites mimic their host's natural prey, but with roles reversed; the parasite gets eaten by the host. This deception provides the parasite easy entry into the host, which they can then feed upon, allowing them to continue their life cycle. Researchers {{may be able to}} predict the host of such parasites based on <b>their</b> <b>appearance</b> and behavior.|$|E
5|$|Lead vocalist and saxophonist Haynes (who {{sometimes}} sang {{through a}} bullhorn), guitarist Paul Leary, dual drummers Coffey and Nervosa (the latter briefly replaced by Cabbage), and whichever bassist {{happened to be}} filling in at the time, had a visual aspect.

Some children died after the effort of simply getting up.|$|E
5|$|After Edmund Halley {{demonstrated}} that the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 were the same body and successfully predicted its return in 1759 by calculating its orbit, that comet became known as Halley's Comet. Similarly, {{the second and third}} known periodic comets, Encke's Comet and Biela's Comet, were named after the astronomers who calculated their orbits rather than their original discoverers. Later, periodic comets were usually named after their discoverers, but comets that had appeared only once continued to be referred to by the year of <b>their</b> <b>appearance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chamunda is {{included}} in the Saptamatrika (seven Matrikas or mothers) lists in the Hindu texts like Mahabharata (Chapter 'Vana-parva'), Devi Purana and Vishnudharmottara Purana.

Though she is always portrayed last (rightmost) in the group, she is sometimes referred to {{as the leader of the}} group. While other Matrikas are considered as Shaktis (powers) of male divinities and resemble them in <b>their</b> <b>appearance,</b> Chamunda is the only Matrika who is a Shakti of the great Goddess Devi rather than a male god. She is also the only Matrika who enjoys independent worship of her own; all other Matrikas are always worshipped together.|$|E

5|$|Colder October and November weather limited aerial {{activities}} {{over the}} NDH. The Partisan operations spread to eastern Serbian territory and the squadrons based at Sarajevo airfield made <b>their</b> <b>appearance</b> on the Bosnian-Serbian border area. The Partisans {{were trying to}} secure and expand their territory {{in the eastern part}} of Yugoslavia, which they had liberated in the autumn of 1941. The ZNDH flew daily supply missions with their Avia-Fokker F.39 and due to the lack of other aircraft also used the venerable Breguets and Potez. These could land on hastily prepared strips and performed very well in airlifting supplies to the surrounded garrison of Višegrad.|$|E

The new contract was projected to keep him with the Penguins through the 2010–11 season.|$|E
