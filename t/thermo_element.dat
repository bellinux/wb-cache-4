Using a molecular absorption cell which contains iodine vapor different scatter techniques are employed to obtain multiple flow field parameters in different media like gas and liquids. For velocity measurements filtered Mie scattering is used and validation experiments with a free jet yield an absolute error of 2 m/s. In gaseous flows the sensor applies filtered Rayleigh scattering to determine temperature values with an accuracy of +/- 3 K and pressure values which show a systematic deviation of - 2 % from reference measurements. Finally filtered Brillouin scattering is introduced for measuring the temperature in liquids like tap water.

40|$|An {{analytic}} model for optimizing thermoelectric {{power generation system}} is developed and utilized for parametric studies. This model {{takes into account the}} external thermal resistances with hot and cold reservoirs. In addition, the spreading thermal resistance in the module substrates is considered to find the impact of designing small fraction of <b>thermo</b> <b>elements</b> per unit area. Previous studies are expanded by a full optimization of the electrical and thermal circuits. The optimum condition satisfies both electrical load resistance match with the internal resistance and the thermal resistance match with the heat source and the heat sink. Thermoelectric element aspect ratio and fill factor are found to be key parameters to optimize. The optimum leg length and the maximum output power are determined by a simple formula. The output power density per mass of the thermoelectric material has a peak when <b>thermo</b> <b>elements</b> cover a fractional area of ~ 1 %. The role of the substrate heat spreading for thermoelectric power generation is equally significant as thermoelement. For a given heat source, the co-optimization of the heat sink and the thermoelectric module should be performed. Active cooling and the design of the heat sink are customized to find the energy payback for the power generation system. The model includes both the air cooled heat sinks and the water cooled micro channels. We find that one can reduce the mass of thermoelement to around 3 ~ 10 % of that in commercial modules for the same output power, as long as the module and elements are designed properly. Also one notes that higher heat flux sources have significantly larger energy payback and reduced cost per output power...|$|R

The origin of the power for this technology is found in the concept of energy harvesting, which resources thermal deviation occurring when a train runs. For this, we measured the temperature generated on the axle box bearing from the train’s running environment by using a high-speed train, analyzed the thermal deviation and calculated the estimated energy harvesting power for the sensor network of the railroad system. The thermal deviation occurred in the axle box bearing when a train runs; the deviation was approximately 12. 97 ∼ 14. 68 ℃. We calculated in the assumption of the basic <b>thermo</b> <b>element</b> of the axle box bearing area, which is the area of the temperature sensor attached on the axle box bearing.

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is on-line {{identification}} of the machinability based on the theory of energy quanta power spectra of the measured signal of the cutting force. Identification method is supported by measurements of the instantaneous temperature in the cutting zone for workpieces with the same chemical composition but different microstructure and mechanical properties. Design/methodology/approach: For measuring the temperature in the cutting zone the direct IFT (Instantly Formed <b>Thermo</b> <b>element)</b> method was used. Findings: Low carbon steel with a previously cold – deformed microstructure has a better machinability in lower cutting force, smaller energy quanta and lower temperature in the cutting zone as low carbon steel with the normalized microstructure. Research limitations/implications: The theory of energy quanta as a basis for on-line identification of cutting parameters for optimization and adaptive control of the cutting process in the industry praxis is not yet in use. But it was developed in laboratory research up to the stage when testing in the industry is already possible, where are because of high productivity the demands on work load of machines and the quality of final products much higher.

In microinjection moulding such behaviour is not acceptable, which as lead to the development of “active” control temperature of the mould named “variotherm” systems.

We analyzed 24 Mg, 26 Mg, 43 Ca, 44 Ca, 88 Sr, 137 Ba, and 138 Ba during the same run to determine Mg/Ca for temperature reconstructions and measured 56 Fe (in a mid-resolution mode) and 55 Mn to monitor contamination by clay minerals and diagenetic coatings (Table  2). Element counts were converted into molar ratios by the intensity ratio method based {{on a series of}} matrix-matched standard solutions. The accuracy and precision of Mg/Ca ratios were confirmed by analyses of the CaCO 3 reference materials BAM RS 3 and ECRM 752 - 1. The repeated analyses gave Mg/Ca ratios of 0.786 [*]±[*] 0.008 (n[*]=[*] 100, 1 σ, RSD[*]=[*] 1.0  %) and 3.92 [*]±[*] 0.06 (n[*]=[*] 24, 1 σ, RSD[*]=[*] 1.5  %), respectively, which were within the reported value for BAM RS 3 (0.791 [*]±[*] 0.03) and slightly higher than the reported value for ECRM 752 - 1 (3.824 [*]±[*] 0.095) (Greaves et al. 2008).

The used LA-ICP-MS system consists of a DUV 193 laser ablation system linked to a <b>Thermo</b> Finnigan <b>Element</b> 2 mass spectrometer. The use of a 193 nm ArF excimer laser (50 - 200 mJ energy output) and the standards NIST 611 and NIST 612 enables to produce and analyse small crater diameters down to 5 μm. Trace-element profiles have been analyzed for the elements Ti, Ge, Al, Fe, Mn, U, Th, Ba, Sr, Rb, Cs, and Y in the ppm- and sub-ppm level. The concentrations of the REE are sometimes below the detection limit of the method. Almost all elements (except Cu) display higher contents in chalcedony than in the macrocrystalline quartz. Fe, for instance, shows a 100 times higher concentration in agate bands compared to quartz, which {{may be due to}} finely distributed iron oxide particles in the chalcedony which probably act as colour pigments. The trace elements in agate are released simultaneously with Si during alteration of the surrounding volcanic rocks.

S. Geological Survey (USGS) reference materials, including basalt (BCR- 1, 2; BHVO- 1, 2), andesite (AGV- 1, 2), rhyolite (RGM- 1, 2), syenite (STM- 1, 2), granodiorite (GSP- 2), and granite (G- 2, 3). USGS rock reference materials are geochemically well characte r ized, but there is neither a systematic methodology nor a database for radiogenic isotopic compositions, even for the widely used BCR- 1. This investigation represents the first comprehensive, systematic analysis of the isotopic composition and concentrati o n of USGS reference materials and provides an important database for the isotopic community. In addition, the range of equipment at the PCIGR, including a Nu Instruments Plasma MC-ICP-MS, a Thermo Finnigan Triton TIMS, and a <b>Thermo</b> Finnigan <b>Element</b> 2 HR-IC P-MS, permits an assessment and comparison of the precision and accuracy of isotopic analyses determined by both the TIMS and MC-ICP-MS methods (e. g., Nd isotopic compositions). For each of the reference materials, 5 to 10 complete replicate analyses provi d e coherent isotopic results, all with external precision below 30 ppm (2 SD) for Sr and Nd isotopic compositions (27 and 24 ppm for TIMS and MC-ICP-MS, respectively). Our results also show that the first- and second-generation USGS reference materials hav e homogeneous Sr and Nd isotopic compositions. Nd isotopic compositions by MC-ICP-MS and TIMS agree to within 15 ppm for all reference materials. Interlaboratory MC-ICP-MS comparisons show excellent agreement for Pb isotopic compositions; however, the repr o ducibility {{is not as good}} as for Sr and Nd. A careful, sequential leaching experiment of three first- and second-generation reference materials (BCR, BHVO, AGV) indicates that the heterogeneity in Pb isotopic compositions, and concentrations, could be dir ectly related to contamination by the steel (mortar/pestle) used to process the materials.

30|$|Ultra-precision cutting {{is one of}} {{the most}} common methods in realizing the nanometric surface {{roughness}} and sub-micrometric form accuracy. Based on the assumption that the workpiece material is removed ideally and the machined surface texture is the replication of tool nose profile, the surface roughness could attain nanometric even sub-nanometric scale, if simply decreasing the feed and increasing the tool nose radius. However, it always deviates from its ideal value due to many factors, such as, material properties of workpiece [1 – 4] and cutting tool geometry [5 – 7]. The side flow of workpiece material, which is a result of the interactions between cutting tool and workpiece material, is considered to be an important role in causing the deviation [8]. It is the plastic deformation of workpiece material at a direction opposite to the feed direction [9]. Two mechanisms are proposed to describe the formation of material side flow [7]. The first one is the squeeze between the tool flank face and the machined surface especially when the uncut chip thickness (UCT) is less than the minimum uncut chip thickness. The second one is due to the trailing edge notch. The material is pressed aside under high temperature and pressure. Material side flow has been modeled by 3 D <b>thermo</b> elasto-viscoplastic finite <b>element</b> method and found that more side flow is generated with higher nose radius and lower feed [10]. The side flow of material has been taken into account to predict the machined surface roughness [8, 11].|$|R

Ultra-low concentration Hg standards (from 1. 5 to 20 pg g(- 1)) were used for the calibration of the <b>Thermo</b> Finnigan MAT <b>Element</b> 2, and a detection limit as low as 0. 18 pg g(- 1) was achieved using Hg- 202.

Precision of the Hg measurements was estimated to be 15 % in terms of relative standard deviation on five replicates and accuracy was checked with an analytical reference material (102 % recovery). Hg concentrations in surface snow samples from the Northern Hemisphere collected in the Canadian Arctic and in Svalbard (Norway) show high variability (1. 2 - 32. 0 pg g-(1)).

40|$|Reliable {{determination}} {{of the effects of}} air quality on {{public health and the environment}} requires accurate measurement of PM(sub 2. 5) mass and the individual chemical components of fine aerosols. This study seeks to evaluate PM(sub 2. 5) measurements that are part of a newly established national network by comparing them with a more conventional sampling system. Experiments were carried out during 2002 at a suburban site in Maryland, United States, where two samplers from the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Speciation Trends Network: Met One Speciation Air Sampling System STNS and Thermo Scientific Reference Ambient Air Sampler STNR, two Desert Research Institute Sequential Filter Samplers DRIF, and a continuous TEOM monitor (<b>Thermo</b> Scientific Tapered <b>Element</b> Oscillating Microbalance) were sampling air in parallel. These monitors differ not only in sampling configuration but also in protocol-specific sample analysis procedures. Measurements of PM(sub 2. 5) mass and major contributing species were well correlated among the different methods with r-values > 0. 8. Despite the good correlations, daily concentrations of PM(sub 2. 5) mass and major contributing species were significantly different at the 95 % confidence level from 5 to 100 % of the time. Larger values of PM(sub 2. 5) mass and individual species were generally reported from STNR and STNS. The January STNR average PM(sub 2. 5) mass (8. 8 (micro) g/per cubic meter) was 1. 5 (micro) g/per cubic meter larger than the DRIF average mass. The July STNS average PM(sub 2. 5) mass (27. 8 (micro) g/per cubic meter) was 3. 8 (micro) g/per cubic meter larger than the DRIF average mass. These differences can only be partially accounted for by known random errors. Variations in flow control, face velocity, and sampling artifacts likely influence the measurement of PM(sub 2. 5) speciation and mass closure.

Yet, our knowledge on the accuracy and comparability of samplers available for measuring the high PM 10 concentrations (> 100 µg m– 3) in the inside air directly upstream of the ventilation exhausts of these buildings is very limited. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide insight into this matter for five candidate samplers: a filter-based cyclone sampler (CYS), the Thermo Scientific FH 62 I-R beta-attenuation sampler (BAS), the <b>Thermo</b> Scientific Tapered <b>Element</b> Oscillating Microbalance, model 1400 ab (TEOM), the TSI DustTrak model 8520 (DT), and the GRIMM Portable Aerosol Spectrometer model 1. 109 (PAS). Equivalence tests were carried out following European Standard EN 12341 using two devices for each candidate sampler (CAS) and four filter-based low-volume reference samplers (RES). Measurements were performed inside three major animal housings (a fattening pig house, a laying hen house, and a broiler house) and inside an office room. Our key results and conclusions are: (1) neither one of the five CASs, nor the RES itself, met the EN 12341 requirement for comparability between devices of the same sampler type. Using a less strict boundary for this aspect – in concert with performing duplicate sampling – may be appropriate. (2) The CYS met the EN 12341 accuracy requirements in pigs and layers, but overestimated the RES concentration in broilers. The BAS, TEOM, and DT underestimated, and the PAS overestimated, RES concentrations in a systematic manner. The use of correction factors seems to be a promising method to calibrate measured values to RES concentrations. (3) The BAS, TEOM, DT, and PAS started to show scattered regression after 432 – 500 h of sampling, which stresses the need for shortened time intervals between full services. In conclusion, some of the samplers tested could be regarded acceptable when appropriate measures (such as duplicate sampling, correction factors, and more frequent servicing) are applied...|$|R
