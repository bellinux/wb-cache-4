40|$|The topic {{addressed}} in this PhD thesis {{is the development of}} a rotational Lumped Parameter model to analyze the dynamic behavior of planetary gearbox. This model allows the study of the gearbox torsional vibrations. In particular, the study carried out in this thesis has focused on simple planetary trains, with three planets and an the outer fix ring. Therefore the following five rotational degree of freedom have been taken into account: the sun rotation, the rotation of the three planets and the carrier rotation. In {{the first part of the}} work, the attention has been focused on a correct description of the gearbox geometry (especially on the toothed wheels geometry) and on the operating characteristics, such as pressure angles and center to center distance. The definition of the geometry was then used for the development of a complex finite element model that, combined with an analytical formulation, allows to obtain the meshing stiffness, depending on the operating conditions of the gearbox. This meshing stiffness was used in the lumped parameter model to define the meshing forces, formed from an elastic component and from a viscous damping component. In addition to the meshing forces, the lumped parameter model considers the inertial actions and the external actions given by the driving <b>torque</b> and the <b>resistant</b> <b>torque.</b> From the simulation results it is possible to analyze the instantaneous angular velocity, the instantaneous angular acceleration of all wheels in different operating conditions, the variation of the meshing stiffness and the forces variations during the gearbox operations. The model is ready for an extension to the translational degrees of freedom, for which the formulation has already been developed. After having developed the entire model, some experimental tests were carried out in order to acquire the torsional vibratory signals of the gearbox unit studied. The tests were performed at different rotational speeds and with different torques applied. The experimental signals obtained have been used to validate the theoretical model. Overall, the research activity is scientifically relevant because it allows, through the development of a lumped parameter model, the study of torsional vibrations of planetary gear units. The model includes the most relevant dynamic phenomena involved in the gearbox, thus allowing the evaluation of the forces that mainly determine the vibrational signature of the studied gearbox. For this reason, the model can be considered a useful tool to support the design and prototyping, as it allows to identify the causes of undesirable dynamic effects and allows to evaluate the effect of any design changes on the dynamic behavior of the gearbox...|$|R

40|$|The Geared Turbofan {{technology}} {{is one of}} the most promising engine configurations to significantly reduce the specific fuel consumption. In this architecture, a power epicyclical gearbox is interposed between the fan and the low pressure spool. Thanks to the gearbox, fan and low pressure spool can turn at different speed, leading to higher engine bypass ratio. Therefore the gearbox efficiency becomes a key parameter for such technology. Further improvement of efficiency can be achieved developing a physical understanding of fluid dynamic losses within the transmission system. These losses are mainly related to viscous effects and they are directly connected to the lubrication method. In this work, the oil injection losses have been studied by means of CFD simulations.

40|$|The {{appropriate}} {{choice of}} an electrical motor and transmission in mechatronicapplications, that is under dynamic conditions generated by both inertial and resistant loads, {{has a deep}} effect on the machine performance. It is influenced by considerations both of technical and economic nature. Such a step in mechatronic design is complicated from two circumstances: the motor torque depends significatively on the motor own moment of inertia, that is unknown, and the motor and the transmissionchoices are deeply interrelated: this paper shows that the key parameter is the generalized motor’s moment of inertia at the joint; furthermore {{the limitations of the}} required components, such as the operating ranges of the drivesystem, must be taken into account. Once the machine task is specified, with generic load’s periodic motion law and <b>resistant</b> <b>torque,</b> a previously stated feasibility criterion allows to eliminate all the drivesystems that are not capable to drive the given load, whatever is the transmission ratio. In this paper, a detailed analysis of this criterion, besides permitting its presentation in terms of known mechanical quantities, allows to address the optimization of the choice of motor and transmission when the motor’s thermal problem is more limiting than the maximum torque exerted by the motor. The method is then applied to an industrial case...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{different}} methods to analyze power transmission systems with computer software {{to aid in}} detection of faulty or damaged systems. It is split into three sections. The first section involves utilizing finite element software to analyze gear stiffness and stresses. A quasi-static and dynamic analysis are done on two sets of fixed axis spur gears and a planetary gear system using ABAQUS to analyze the stress, strain and gear mesh stiffness variation. In the second section, the vibrational patterns produced by a simple bevel gear system are investigated by an experiment and by dynamic modeling in ADAMS. Using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the dynamic contact forces, a comprehensive frequency-domain analysis will reveal unique vibration spectra at distinct frequencies around the gear mesh frequencies, their super- and sub- harmonics, and their side-band modulations. ADAMS simulation results are then compared with the experimental results. Constraints, bearing <b>resistant</b> <b>torques,</b> and other key parameters are applied {{as closely as possible}} to real operating conditions. The third section looks closely at the dynamic contact forces of a practical two-stage planetary gear. Using the same FFT approach in the second section, a frequency-domain analysis will reveal distinct frequencies around both the first-stage and the second-stage gear mesh frequencies, and their harmonics. In addition, joint time-frequency analysis (JTFA) will be applied to damaged and undamaged planetary gear systems with transient start-up conditions to observe how the frequency contents of the contact force evolve over time...|$|R

For this device, during the working phase may arise secondary phenomena that may affect in negative way its use. Therefore, in this research, the limits of applicability of it were determined. Indeed, it has been evaluated the range of variability of the error during the position control phase, detecting an error  minimum for which the system considered is insensitive. This error has been studied in the transitory period, determining its performance using the computer code MatLab Subsequently it has been performed the dynamic study of the considered system examining the function error. Some cases, considering the viscous damping not equal at zero, have numerically been determined. It has been possible to note that the range time of the transitory period decreases when the damping values increase. Besides it is resulted that, if we wish to limit at the minimum the range time of the transitory period, without to change the inertia moment J, we have to change the viscous damping values, F. But in this way, it would cause the drawback to increase the energy dissipation for the system considered, with the necessity to use greater power engines.

40|$|Purpose: Heat loss plays very {{important}} role in CNC systems, especially in suspension systems with permanent load that are usually used for testing, detection and automatic cutting, the adjusting of motor torque in each axis is based on starting by maximum current required to overcome against <b>resistant</b> <b>torque</b> on the motion surface of the system. Design/methodology/approach: In this research a new control method is introduced for the minimization of heat loss in CNC motors. In these systems the misdirected current that causes magnetic misalignment and reduces the torque is converted to heat in the motor winding, thus reducing the motor continuous torque capability. Findings: This method {{is based on an}} open-architecture of a dynamic control to optimize the input current in order to dissipate the minimal heat loss. So that, it reaches the requested velocity-position condition with the lowest amount of misaligned magnetic field and current converted to heat. Research limitations/implications: The dynamic performance implications are more important than the steady-state torque disadvantage. Practical implications: An algorithm for the dynamic torque control is given and a simulation is carried out using this algorithm for a two axis CNC cutting system with two-guider bars suspension. Reaching to the actual requested motor current is practical implication. From this point of view, the enhanced free running of pulse width modulated (PWM) is represented.

40|$|A {{new model}} of {{power-assisted}} bicycle has been designed, set up and tested. The main innovative solutions for the pedelec prototype are {{described in the present}} paper: the electric motor position; the new mechanical transmission; the low cost measurement system of the driving torque; the special test rig. Differently from a common approach, in which the electric motor is located on one of the three hubs of the bicycle, the idea of the pedelec prototype consists of an electrical motor in the central position that, by means of a bevel gear, transmits the torque on the central hub. The other innovative solution is represented by the motion transmission from the motor to the pedal shaft, achieved by two different gearboxes: the first one is a planetary gearbox and the second one is a simple bevel gear. The pedelec prototype contains also a new low cost measurement system of the driving torque based on a strain gauge load cell located {{on one side of the}} rear wheel, between the hub and the frame. Moreover, a commercial cycling simulator has been suitably modified in order to properly install the different sensors for the measurement of the performance of the pedelec.

30|$|The microswimmer {{has been}} {{actuated}} at a frequency range from 1 to 16  Hz on a Si substrate in the tank. The flux {{density of the}} magnetic field maintains 9 mT during the experiments. When the input frequency is below 8 Hz, the microswimmer exhibits simple rotation and no translational velocity is observed (Fig. 9 a), whereas it exhibits propulsion with varied poses when the input frequency is higher than 8 Hz (Fig. 9 b). Experiment results show that 8 Hz is the pose-change frequency ω _c. When the input frequency is below ω _c (8 Hz), the microswimmer exhibits simple rotation and the drag torque is small enough to be balanced by the magnetic torque. The projection of rotation axis in XY-plane is closing to the centroid of the simplified triangle gradually with increasing the input frequency, {{in order to reduce}} the drag torque (Fig. 4 a). Such adjustment of rotation axis cannot affect the actuation pose (simple rotation) of the microswimmer. Equations 14 – 17 have shown the limitation of this adjustment method, which also explains why the microswimmer cannot maintain simple rotation with input frequency higher than ω _c. While when the input frequency is higher than ω _c (8  Hz), the drag torque is affected by both the pose angle φ and the distance d_m (Fig. 4 c). Different input frequencies of the magnetic field change the drag torque, and dynamic behaviors of the microswimmer are governed by the interplay of magnetic and <b>resistant</b> <b>torques.</b> The dynamic behaviors appear when turning on the magnetic field or changing the input frequency (see Additional file 1). As shown in the experimental results (Fig. 9 b), after turning on the magnetic field the dynamic behaviors of the microswimmer last less than 2  s (0 – 2 s). After that the microswimmer exhibits steady rotation and propulsion (2 – 29 s).|$|R

The study of the error changing during the transitory period has been performed, in the hypothesis of absence of the insensibility range, and its changing laws have been determined by mean the aid of the computational code MatLab. Subsequently the dynamic study of the considered system has been performed, by using the pressure regulation valve, and considering the function error.

40|$|Background: Robot-assisted {{rehabilitation}} is {{an advanced}} new technology in stroke rehabilitation to provide intensive training. Post-stroke motor recovery depends on active rehabilitation by voluntary participation of patient’s paretic motor system {{as early as}} possible in order to promote reorganization of brain. However, voluntary residual motor efforts to the affected limb have not been involved enough in most robot-assisted rehabilitation for patients after stroke. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the feasibility of robot-assisted rehabilitation using myoelectric control on upper limb motor recovery. Methods: In the present study, an exoskeleton-type rehabilitation robotic system was designed to provide voluntarily controlled assisted torque to the affected wrist. Voluntary intention was involved by using the residual surface electromyography (EMG) from flexor carpi radialis(FCR) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) on the affected limb to control the mechanical assistance provided by the robotic system during wrist flexion and extension in a 20 -session training. The system also applied constant <b>resistant</b> <b>torque</b> to the affected wrist during the training. Sixteen subjects after stroke had been recruited for evaluating the tracking performance and therapeutical effects of myoelectrically controlled robotic system. Results: With the myoelectrically-controlled assistive torque, stroke survivors could reach a larger range of motion with a significant decrease in the EMG signal from the agonist muscles. The stroke survivors could be trained in the unreached range with their voluntary residual EMG on the paretic side. After 20 -session rehabilitation training, there was a non-significant increase in the range of motion and a significant decrease in the root mean square error (RMSE) between the actual wrist angle and target angle. Significant improvements also could be found in muscle strength and clinical scales. Conclusions: These results indicate that robot-aided therapy with voluntary participation of patient’s paretic motor system using myoelectric control might have positive effect on upper limb motor recovery.

40|$|By-wire" {{systems are}} {{characterized}} {{by the lack of}} mechanical link between the control device and the actuator, being it hydraulic or mechanical. The connection is replaced by a mechatronic system, equipped with redundant sensors and actuators [1]. SBW consists in two electro-mechanical actuators that steer the vehicle wheels and generate a resistance torque against the rotation of the steering wheel during cornering maneuvers. Each actuator is characterized by the presence of an electric motor, the first is connected to the pinion of the steering system, the other is connected to the steering wheel. The electric motor connected to the pinion is controlled in position and the command signal is generated by a PID controller. Reference position depends only on steering wheel angle and steering ratio. The torque control of the second electric motor is more difficult; the reference torque value has to be realistic in order to grant the proper feeling to the driver. The steering column is removed, as well as every hydraulic component {{that is part of the}} classic servo-assisted steering system. The logic that controls the system needs the information provided by two position sensors: one encoder is devoted to measure the steering wheel angular position, one linear position transducer measures the position of the rack [2]. The connection between the control units of the two sub-systems is realized through a communication bus. The aim of SBW technology is to completely remove as many mechanical components (steering shaft, column, gear reduction mechanism, etc.) as possible, thus simplifying the car interior design, increasing the driver safety in case of frontal crash. Moreover, active safety and handling are increased thanks to the variable ratio between steering wheel angle and tyres' steering angle, determined by a control logic [3]. SbW system's steering wheel has to generate a <b>resistant</b> <b>torque</b> which adds to the friction one. Such torque must be felt as natural by the average driver and carry information about vehicle dynamic condition. The paper describes the design of a SBW prototype, obtained from a classical steering system (see Fig. 13) [4] [5]. A Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) test bench is also described: it is realized in order to test feedback torque generation and steering wheel efficiency influence on vehicle behavior. Actual steering wheel angle is used as input for a ten degrees of freedom model that calculates the vehicle dynamics, defining the steered wheels motion and the resistance torque at the pinion (see Fig. 10). An analog signal is generated in order to control the steering wheel electric motor torque. Experimental tests are performed to optimize the feedback torque control. The reference torque is then calculated only using signals coming from vehicle on board sensors. Control logic is finally improved in order to stiffen the steering system unnaturally when lateral acceleration is about to reach adherence limit and prevent further steering action (see Fig. 14...|$|R
