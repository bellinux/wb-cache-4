5|$|Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (1935)—documenting the 1934 Nuremberg Rally—and Olympia (1938)—covering the 1936 Summer Olympics—pioneered {{techniques}} of camera movement and editing that influenced later films.

Both films remain controversial, as their aesthetic merit is inseparable from their propagandising of National Socialist ideals.|$|E
5|$|The big {{dance was}} the film's most {{sustained}} and elaborate sequence, so two cameras were used, with frequent recourse to hand-holding and <b>telephoto</b> zooming in order both {{to sustain the}} documentary-style look and feel and to take pressure off the performers, who were not always sure whether they were being included in the shots.|$|E

5|$|According to Peter Freuchen, {{the scene}} in which the wolf attacks Mala is real. Freuchen says that Mala, armed with {{a rock and a}} pistol beneath his fur jacket, spent three afternoons trying to lure a wolf into attacking him. A rifleman and a cinematographer using a camera with a <b>telephoto</b> lens {{followed}} at a distance. The wolf attack was filmed from far away, with the rifleman ready to shoot the wolf in case Mala was unable to kill it. As shown in film, Mala was able to kill the wolf without using his pistol or relying on the rifleman, and was not injured in the attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot with the {{anamorphic}} process. Peckinpah and his cinematographer, Lucien Ballard, also {{made use of}} <b>telephoto</b> lenses, that allowed for objects and people in both the background and foreground to be compressed in perspective. The effect is best seen in the shots where the Bunch makes the walk to Mapache's headquarters to free Angel. As they walk forward, a constant flow of people passes {{between them and the}} camera; {{most of the people in}} the foreground are as sharply focused as the Bunch. The editing of the film is notable in that shots from multiple angles were spliced together in rapid succession, often at different speeds, placing greater emphasis on the chaotic nature of the action and the gunfights.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} animators studied real-life {{animals for}} reference, {{as was done}} for the 1942 Disney film Bambi. Jim Fowler, renowned wildlife expert, visited the studios on several occasions {{with an assortment of}} lions and other savannah inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings authenticity. The animators also studied animal movements at the Miami MetroZoo under guidance from wildlife expert Ron Magill. The Pride Lands are modeled on the Kenyan national park visited by the crew. Varied focal lengths and lenses were employed to differ from the habitual portrayal of Africa in documentaries—which employ <b>telephoto</b> lenses to shoot the wildlife from a distance. The epic feel drew inspiration from concept studies by artist Hans Bacher—which, following Scribner's request for realism, tried to depict effects such as lens flare—and the works of painters Charles Marion Russell, Frederic Remington and Maxfield Parrish. Because the characters were not anthropomorphized, all the animators had to learn to draw four-legged animals, and the story and character development was done through use of longer shots following the characters.|$|E

5|$|In March 1909, Boyce {{embarked}} on a two-month trip to Europe, which included a visit to his daughters, who were in Rome. On returning to America, Boyce organized a photographic expedition to Africa with the innovative aerial photographer George R. Lawrence. Boyce met with safari organizers and outfitters and provisioned his expedition in London and Naples. His son Benjamin and Lawrence's son Raymond {{were part of the}} expedition. Cartoonist John T. McCutcheon joined the expedition while they were sailing from Naples to Africa. The group disembarked at Mombasa, Kenya, and was in Nairobi by September. After hiring local porters and guides, the entire expedition totaled about 400 people, about three-fourths of whom were servants. It required 15 train cars to move the people and equipment to the area the expedition was going to explore near Kijabi and Lake Victoria. The expedition was a failure because a <b>telephoto</b> lens was neither brought nor subsequently procured, the hot air balloons were not suitable for the conditions on the plains of East Africa, and the cameras were so large and noisy to move into position that the animals were scared away. The members of the expedition had to resort to buying photographs of big game animals from shops in cities such as Nairobi. The expedition did manage to successfully hunt several species of big game animals.|$|E
25|$|Long focus lens: {{angle of}} view {{narrower}} than a normal lens. This is any lens with a focal length longer than the diagonal measure of the film or sensor. The {{most common type of}} long focus lens is the <b>telephoto</b> lens, a design that uses a special <b>telephoto</b> group to be physically shorter than its focal length.|$|E

25|$|While {{the crop}} factor of APS-C cameras {{effectively}} narrows {{the angle of}} view of long-focus (<b>telephoto)</b> lenses, {{making it easier to}} take close-up images of distant objects, wide-angle lenses suffer a reduction in their angle of view by the same factor.|$|E
25|$|In {{portable}} photography equipment, single-axis gimbal {{heads are}} used {{in order to allow}} a balanced movement for camera and lenses.

50|$|Many Pentax lenses, {{like their}} medium- to {{high-end}} camera bodies, are weather-sealed, allowing for their continued use in poor weather and wet locations. Lenses marked as WR bear a “simplified weather-resistant construction … {{which makes it}} difficult for water to enter the lens” compared to the DA* and AW lenses, which are “dust-proof and water-resistant”. Pentax currently provides weather-sealed premium lenses up 560 mm. The largest lens produced by Pentax was the Reflex 2000mm, with non-mirrored lenses available up to the A* 1200mm. As with most manufacturers, <b>telephotos</b> of this range are no longer in production. Pentax provided premium focal lengths well beyond 1200mm, such as their 3800mm through the Pentax telescope division.|$|R

25|$|The visual {{ability of}} {{birds of prey}} is legendary, and the keenness of their {{eyesight}} {{is due to a}} variety of factors. Raptors have large eyes for their size, 1.4 times greater than the average for birds of the same weight, and the eye is tube-shaped to produce a larger retinal image. The resolving power of an eye depends both on the optics, large eyes with large appertures suffers less from diffraction and can have larger retinal images due to a long focal length, and on the density of receptor spacing. The retina has a large number of receptors per square millimeter, which determines the degree of visual acuity. The more receptors an animal has, the higher its ability to distinguish individual objects at a distance, especially when, as in raptors, each receptor is typically attached to a single ganglion. Many raptors have foveas with far more rods and cones than the human fovea (65,000/mm2 in American kestrel, 38,000 in humans) and this provides these birds with spectacular long distance vision. It is proposed that the shape of the deep central fovea of raptors can create a <b>telephoto</b> optical system, increasing the size of the retinal image in the fovea and thereby increasing the spatial resolution. Behavioural studies show that some large eyed raptors (Wedge-tailed eagle, Old world vultures) and have ca 2 times higher spatial resolution than humans, but many medium and small sized raptors have comparable or lower spatial resolution.|$|E

2500|$|For some lenses, {{including}} a few long <b>telephotos,</b> lenses mounted on bellows, and perspective-control and tilt/shift lenses, the mechanical linkage was impractical, and automatic aperture control was not provided. [...] Many such lenses incorporated a feature {{known as a}} [...] "preset" [...] aperture, which allows the lens to be set to working aperture and then quickly switched between working aperture and full aperture without looking at the aperture control. A typical operation might be to establish rough composition, set the working aperture for metering, return to full aperture for a final check of focus and composition, and focusing, and finally, return to working aperture just before exposure. Although slightly easier than stopped-down metering, operation is less convenient than automatic operation. Preset aperture controls have taken several forms; the most common has been the use of essentially two lens aperture rings, with one ring setting the aperture and the other serving as a limit stop when switching to working aperture. [...] Examples of lenses {{with this type of}} preset aperture control are the Nikon PC Nikkor 28mm 3.5 and the SMC Pentax Shift 6×7 75mm 4.5. [...] The Nikon PC Micro-Nikkor 85mm 2.8D lens incorporates a mechanical pushbutton that sets working aperture when pressed and restores full aperture when pressed a second time.|$|R
50|$|While the Robots {{were capable}} of {{sequence}} photography, the shutter that made this possible placed some constraints upon taking lenses and shutter speeds. To reach speeds as high as 1/500 second the inertia of the thin vulcanite shutter disc had to be kept at a minimum, requiring a small-diameter disc with a minimal sector opening. The screw in lens mount was 26 mm in diameter. The clear lens opening was only 20 mm. In contrast, Leica's mount was almost twice as large at 39 mm. Further, to permit lens interchangeability, the shutter was mounted behind the lens so the disc interrupted the expanding light cone. This placed some limits on lens design. While the 75mm Sonnar could be used with the aperture set to f/22, the Tele-Xenar suffered from some shutter disc vignetting unless opened more.The maximum focal length lens for general photographic use that could be fitted with acceptable vignetting was 75 mm, although <b>telephotos</b> up to 600 mm were offered. A 150 mm Tele-Xenar was available for long-distance action photography, but it produced a vignetted circular image on the 24 × 24 mm frame. The lack of a rangefinder on the Robot and Robot Star required zone focusing of these long lenses: every shot had to be estimated or premeasured. All of the mechanical movement made for a noisy camera, although not as noisy as some modern motor drives. For an extra fee, Robot-Berning supplied silenced versions with nylon gears.|$|R

It alleged that Malaysia's photograph had been taken using a <b>telephoto</b> lens, which had exaggerated the height of Mount Berbukit by about seven times. Singapore's then Attorney-General Chao Hick Tin said that the photograph had been [...] "an attempt to convey a subliminal message of proximity between Pedra Branca and the coast of Johor", but it was not an accurate reflection of what visitors to Pedra Branca would see if they were looking towards Johor.|$|E
500|$|Its cinematography, lighting, and {{flashback}} structure influenced such film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s as The Killers, Keeper of the Flame, Caught, The Great Man and This Gun for Hire. David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson {{have written}} that [...] "For {{over a decade}} thereafter American films displayed exaggerated foregrounds and somber lighting, enhanced by long takes and exaggerated camera movements." [...] However, by the 1960s filmmakers such as those from the French New Wave and Cinéma vérité movements favored [...] "flatter, more shallow images with softer focus" [...] and Citizen Kanes style became less fashionable. American filmmakers in the 1970s combined these two approaches by using long takes, rapid cutting, deep focus and <b>telephoto</b> shots all at once. Its use of long takes influenced films such as The Asphalt Jungle, and its use of deep focus cinematography influenced Gun Crazy, The Whip Hand, The Devil's General and Justice Is Done. The flashback structure in which different characters have conflicting versions of past events influenced La commare secca and Man of Marble.|$|E
500|$|In {{film editor}} Susan Korda's 2005 lecture, [...] "We'll Fix It in the Edit!?", at the Berlinale Talent Campus, she broadly {{explained}} {{the contribution of}} editing to the film: [...] "What is fascinating in Jaws is that the shark has a personality, the shark has an intelligence, indeed sometimes I think the shark {{has a sense of}} humor, morbid as it might be. And that was all achieved in the first two acts of the film before you see the shark. So the cutting was very essential for that." [...] David Bordwell has used the second shark attack scene in Jaws as (literally) a textbook illustration of an editing innovation that occurred in the late 1960s. The innovation, which Fields herself named the [...] "wipe by cut", can be used when a character is filmed from a distance using a <b>telephoto</b> lens. The cut to a different framing of the character occurs during the interruption by a figure who passes between the camera and the character. The cut thus masks itself, and avoids drawing the viewer's attention away from the narrative of the scene.|$|E
500|$|In his {{analysis}} of the Spaghetti Western genre, Alex Cox described The Great Silence as Corbucci's [...] "tightest, most relentless Western; his best and his bleakest. It's shot in his trademark messy, over-edited, jerky-zoom style, and its <b>telephoto</b> close-ups are frequently out of focus. Yet it is incredibly beautiful". He voiced praise for Ippoliti's strategy of [...] "shooting through things" [...] (a marked improvement over his work on Navajo Joe), the tight script, the strong female characters and the tragic nature of the ending, rooted in Corbucci's pessimism towards the deaths of radical political leaders. Performance-wise, he described Sheriff Burnett and Regina, the film's equivalent of the [...] "cute/funny" [...] characters that had appeared in Corbucci's earlier Westerns, as [...] "tolerable" [...] due to their senses of dark humour and morality, and praised McGee, Pistilli and Brega's acting. Cox also felt that Kinski's Loco was the actor's finest appearance in a Western, and that Trintignant's performance, which might have seemed doll-like in the hands of actors such as Franco Nero, John Phillip Law and Terence Hill, was pulled off [...] "flawlessly. His character's moral quandary, and decision to sacrifice himself, are perfectly conveyed". Noting that Corbucci seemed proud of The Great Silence – [...] "a great work, a great Spaghetti Western, a great Western, a classic of transgressive cinema" [...] – [...] Cox believes that Zanuck's withholding of the international release and its poor domestic performance were key factors in the decline in quality of Corbucci's output following its release.|$|E
