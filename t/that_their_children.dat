5|$|In the mid-2000s, German sect experts {{expressed}} concerns that Scientologists were becoming {{active in the}} German after-school tutoring market. These concerns arose because customers of around 20 after-school tutoring centres operated by Scientologists in Frankfurt, Hamburg, Stuttgart and elsewhere might be unaware <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> were being taught by Scientologists, using Scientology methods. Brochures advertising the tutoring services would at most mention the name of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, but not Scientology itself.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility {{lies with}} parents for making sure <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> attend and {{register}} at school.

5|$|In 1852, {{the family}} moved from Niles to Poland, Ohio so <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> could attend the better schools there.

He remained at Allegheny for only one year, returning home in 1860 after becoming ill and depressed. He also spent time at Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio as a board member. Although his health recovered, family finances declined and McKinley was unable to return to Allegheny, first working as a postal clerk and later taking a job teaching at a school near Poland, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Later King Shantanu, {{captivated by}} her {{fragrance}} and beauty, {{fell in love}} with Satyavati. She married Shantanu on condition <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> inherit the throne, denying the birthright of Shantanu's eldest son (and crown prince) Bhishma. Satyavati bore Shantanu two children, Chitrangada and Vichitravirya. After Shantanu's death, she and her prince sons with the help of Bhishma ruled the kingdom. Although both her sons died childless, she arranged for her first son, Vyasa, to father the children of the two widows of Vichitravirya through niyoga. The children, (Dhritarashtra and Pandu) became the fathers of the Kauravas and Pandavas respectively. After Pandu's death, Satyavati went to the forest for penance and breathed her last before witnessing the Kurukshetra War.|$|E
5|$|Welfare was expanded, as {{characterized}} {{by the introduction of}} non-contributory old-age pensions and payments to mothers provided their babies are taken for health checks and <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> attend school. Hundreds of free tractors were also handed out. The prices of gas and many foodstuffs were controlled, and local food producers were made to sell in the local market rather than export. A new state-owned body was also set up to distribute food at subsidized prices. All these measures helped to curb inflation, while the economy grew (partly because of rising public spending), accompanied by stronger public finances which brought economic stability.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{many white}} Zimbabweans {{complained that they}} were {{suffering}} from racial discrimination. Many whites remained uneasy about living under the government of a black Marxist and they also feared <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> {{would be unable to}} secure jobs. There was a growing exodus to South Africa, and in 1980, 1700 whites—approximately a tenth of the white Zimbabwean population—emigrated. Mugabe's government had pledged support for the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid forces within South Africa, although did not allow them to use Zimbabwe as a base for their military operations. To protest apartheid and white minority rule in South Africa, Mugabe's government banned Zimbabwe from engaging South Africa in any sporting competitions. In turn, South Africa tried to destabilise Zimbabwe by blocking trade routes into the country and supporting anti-Mugabist militants among the country's white minority.|$|E
5|$|While Margaret {{was still}} an infant, William lost his job {{and was unable to}} find regular work. The family {{suffered}} hardship, with the threat of the workhouse a constant fear. Nevertheless, William and Ann did their best to ensure <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> were educated and prepared for life. Margaret was a clever child, whose skills at reciting poetry or playing piano pieces were often displayed at town events and Sunday School outings. Until the age of 13 she attended the local elementary school; she then worked for a year as a pupil-teacher (she was paid three shillings a week) in the school's boys' department. Local employment opportunities being scarce, she left Chard in 1887, at the age of 14, to begin an apprenticeship at a draper's shop in Hove, near Brighton.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides). MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system. The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> would tolerate. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on twelve children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} much {{research}} into support required by parents when finding out <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> has a medical need resulting in severe disability (Baird, McConachie, & Scrutton, 2000; Billson & Tyrrell, 2003; Fallowfield, 1993; Graungaard & Skov, 2007; Hasnat & Graves, 2000). There has been less research regarding the support required by parents in school when finding out <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> has a less severe difficulty (such as moderate global developmental delay or moderate learning difficulty). Parents may experience a grief reaction upon diagnosis of <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> condition {{which is similar to}} a bereavement (Bowes, Lowes, Warner, & Gregory, 2009; Bruce & Schultz, 2001; Lowes & Lyne, 2000). It is important to know whether parents can have a similar reaction when they discover <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> may have learning difficulties. A review of available literature has failed to identify adequate resources and guidelines specific to working with non-finite (on-going) loss (Collings, 2008). This research aims to investigate how parents experience the process of finding out <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> has learning difficulties. It considers ways in which parents experience school support. This study employed Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis and Appreciative Inquiry through semi-structured interviews with four parents of children with learning difficulties who were aged 5 - 7 years old. Analysis indicated three superordinate themes of: loss, social comparison and sense of belonging. Limitations and implications for future research are considered...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{any difference between}} the attributions parents made about <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem, in {{parents of children with}} an Autism Spectrum Disorder and parents of children with Down Syndrome. Seventy-six parents of children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder and fifty-two parents of children with Down Syndrome completed a series of questionnaires on-line, regarding <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem, <b>their</b> beliefs about <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem and the parent’s level of anxiety and depression. A significant difference was found between the groups on four of the causal items; other health problem, child’s emotional state, child’s personality and diet. Parents of children with Down Syndrome showed a higher level of agreement <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem could be attributed to another health problem compared to parents of children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder. Parents of children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder showed a higher level of agreement <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem could be attributed to <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> personality, <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> emotional state and <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> diet compared to parents of children with DS. There was a high level of agreement across all parents <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> disability was a causal factor to their sleep problem and differences in attributions may reflect characteristics of the child’s diagnosis. The results are consistent with previous findings that parents view disability as an important causal factor to <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem and suggest a possible overlap in parent’s views of <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem and views of their disability...|$|R
