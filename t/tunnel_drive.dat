50|$|Although {{explosives}} {{were already}} in use in the 17th century in the mines of the Upper Harz, tunnels continued to be hewn out by hand, that is with hammer and chisel for much longer. The reason {{was that there were}} difficulties in determining the right amount of gunpowder and fears that tunnels running just under the surface would collapse or that the explosive would produce fissures in the rock causing water to leak away. Almost all water <b>tunnels</b> were <b>driven</b> by counter-heading. Until the 18th century the miners excavated tunnels by following the weakest rock; this sometimes created a zigzag route that deviated significantly from the direct line. Not until the 19th century were <b>tunnels</b> <b>driven</b> in a strictly direct line using explosives.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Recently, {{tunnelling}} with TBM {{is getting}} popular {{for the construction}} of cable tunnel in urban area. Mechanized tunnelling method using shield TBM has various advantages such as minimization of ground settlement and prevention of vibration induced by blasting that should be accompanied by conventional tunnelling. In Korea, earth pressure balance (EPB) type shield TBM has been mainly used. Despite the popularity of EPB shield TBM for cable tunnel construction, study on the mechanical behavior of cable <b>tunnel</b> <b>driven</b> by shield TBM is insufficient. Especially, the effect of backfill grout injection on the behavior of cable <b>tunnel</b> <b>driven</b> by shield TBM is investigated in this study. Tunnelling with shield TBM is simulated using 3 D FEM. The distance of backfill grout injection from the end of shield skin varies. Sectional forces such as axial force, shear force and bending moment are monitored. Vertical displacement at the ground surface is measured. Futhermore, the relation between volume loss and the distance of backfill grout injection from the end of skin plate is derived. Based on the stability analysis with the results obtained from the numerical analysis, the mos...|$|R
40|$|The {{adhesive}} {{action of}} clays confronted during <b>tunnel</b> <b>drives</b> in which slurry shields are implemented has a devastating {{impact on the}} advance rate. This report evaluates past experiences of the clogging action of cohesive soils (clays) and introduces detailed examinations of adhesion between cohesive soils and steel surfaces. This allows good definition of sticky soils and also gives {{a better understanding of}} the mechanisms that cause stickiness. The conclusions drawn out of experiences gained from past <b>tunnel</b> <b>drives</b> have been based upon the analysis of soil parameters. These enable forecasts to be made to the potential clogging effect (stickness) of clays. Furthermore, typical clogging forms and areas are introduced as well as current countermeasures to prevent them. The concepts for the laboratory tests to measure adhesion are based on thorough research and evaluation of existing publications. These also give insight of the fundamentals of soil adheshion, the technical possibilities to measure them as well as the large number of influencing factors. Laboratory test samples have partly been taken from <b>tunnel</b> <b>drives</b> and cover a wide spectrum of different mineralogical compositions. Shear and tension tests are carried out in order to measure tangential and normal adhesion. All surfaces of the samples and testing equipment (steel) are moistened, prior to sample placement, to simulate the interaction between clays and shields on slurry drives. The moistening of the test samples and equipment is carried out with water as well as other fluids with additives. The results of the adhesion tests show a clear dependence on the moistening time and the duration of contact between soil and steel. Further dependencies are found on the consistency of the clay and the composition of the moistening fluid. Significant correlations can be found between the adhesion and the mineralogical composition of a clay as well as its plasticity. Theoretical evaluations indicate that adhesion is created by differing water/fluid pressures in the soil pores and the surrounding. Previous moistening causes a film of water/fluid to be trapped between the clay and the steel surfaces. The swelling action of the clay absorbs part of the water film which causes suction and makes the clay stick to the steel surface. This effect not only applies to the excavation chamber of slurry shields, but also to all other soil handling activities in which water is present. The report includes advice which contributes to a better assessment of the adhesion of clays during the preparations of future <b>tunnel</b> <b>drives</b> in which slurry shields are to be implemented.
