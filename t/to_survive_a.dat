The Liber Eliensis claimed {{that he had been}} born by Caesarian section, but this is most likely a later {{accretion}} to his lifestory, added after his death because of efforts to have him declared a saint. The belief was that for an infant <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> caesarian section was a miracle, and thus a fitting beginning for a future saint.|$|E
5|$|The {{delay in}} the CSM caused by the fire enabled NASA {{to catch up on}} man-rating the LM and Saturn V. Apollo 4 (AS-501) was the first {{unmanned}} flight of the Saturn V, carrying a Block I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the Command Module's heat shield <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, the House of Lords {{began to}} use the tower to store its {{parliamentary}} records, building a house alongside it {{for the use of the}} parliamentary clerk, and extensive improvements followed in 1621. The tower continued as the Lords' records office through the 18th century, and several sets of renovations and building work were carried out to improve its fire-proofing and comfort, creating the current appearance of the tower. In 1834, the tower was one of only four buildings <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> terrible fire in Westminster, and in the aftermath the records were moved to a new, purpose-built archive.|$|E

5|$|Blackfish {{wanted to}} {{continue}} to Boonesborough and capture it, since it was now poorly defended, but Boone convinced him that {{the women and children}} were not hardy enough <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> winter trek. Instead, Boone promised that Boonesborough would surrender willingly to the Shawnees the following spring. Boone did not have an opportunity to tell his men that he was bluffing to prevent an immediate attack on Boonesborough, however. Boone pursued this strategy so convincingly that many of his men concluded that he had switched his loyalty to the British.|$|E
5|$|In 866, a major Arab raid along Dalmatia struck Budva and Kotor, {{and then}} laid siege to Dubrovnik in 867. The city appealed to Byzantine Emperor Basil the Macedonian, who responded by sending {{over one hundred}} ships. Finally, the 866–867 Saracens' siege of Dubrovnik, which lasted fifteen months, was raised due to the {{intervention}} of Basil I, who sent a fleet {{under the command of}} Niketas Oryphas in relief of the city. After this successful intervention, the Byzantine navy sailed along the coast collecting promises of loyalty to the empire from the Dalmatian cities. The damage done by Saracens is not known, but the fact that Dubrovnik managed <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> fifteen-month-long siege, proves how well the city was fortified.|$|E
5|$|It {{appeared}} {{as though the}} government might seize Lincoln for being insolvent. The investigation was, however, taking a long time. Keating was asking that Lincoln be given a lenient judgment by the FHLBB, {{so that it could}} limit its high risk investments and get into the safe (at the time) home mortgage business, thus allowing the business <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b> <b>A</b> letter from audit firm Arthur Young & Co. bolstered Keating's case that the government investigation was taking a long time. Keating now wanted the five senators to intervene with the FHLBB on his behalf.|$|E

5|$|Modern historians, doubting that a Persian {{commander}} {{would have}} sabotaged his own invasion, have suggested several other possible scenarios. It is, however, {{impossible to know}} exactly how the Naxians {{became aware of the}} invasion, but undoubtedly they were aware, and began to make preparations. Herodotus tells us that the Naxians had previously had no inkling of the expedition, but that when news arrived they brought everything in from the fields, gathered enough food with which <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> siege and reinforced their walls.|$|E
5|$|Some {{terrestrial}} beetles that exploit shoreline and floodplain habitats have physiological adaptations for surviving floods. In {{the event}} of flooding, adult beetles may be mobile enough {{to move away from}} flooding, but larvae and pupa often cannot. Adults of Cicindela togata are unable to survive immersion in water, but larvae are able <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> prolonged period, up to 6 days, of anoxia during floods. Anoxia tolerance in the larvae may have been sustained by switching to anaerobic metabolic pathways or by reducing metabolic rate. Anoxia tolerance in the adult Carabid beetle Pelophilia borealis was tested in laboratory conditions and it was found that they could survive a continuous period of up to 127 days in an atmosphere of 99.9% nitrogen at 0°C.|$|E
5|$|Charlton married Pat Kemp on 6 January 1958, and {{his brother}} Bobby acted as his best man. They have three children: John (born in January 1959), Deborah (born 1961) and Peter, who was born just after Charlton senior played in the 1966 World Cup final. During the 1960s he ran two clothes shops in Leeds, and he also later {{operated}} the souvenir shop at Elland Road. Charlton is a keen amateur fisherman and also takes part in field sports. He appeared on Desert Island Discs in 1972 and 1996, and chose to take with him The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain, the Encyclopaedia of How <b>to</b> <b>Survive,</b> <b>a</b> spyglass, and a fishing rod.

5|$|From there, the Flames {{went on to}} the Campbell Conference Finals, {{where they}} {{defeated}} the St. Louis Blues in another seven-game series. This time, Calgary had <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> scare of its own, shaking off the Monday Night Miracle at the St. Louis Arena. Trailing by a score of 5–2 with 10 minutes to play in the third period of Game 6, the Blues mounted a furious comeback to send the contest into overtime, where Doug Wickenheiser scored to force a deciding seventh game. Calgary would win Game 7 at home, 2–1, advancing into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time. The Flames proved to be no match for the Montreal Canadiens, losing the championship series in five games. Montreal rookie goaltender Patrick Roy was nearly unbeatable in the last two games, allowing only four goals en route to winning the Conn Smythe Trophy.|$|E
5|$|Keynes {{contended that}} {{economic}} output is {{positively correlated with}} money velocity. He explained the relationship via changing liquidity preferences: people increase their money holdings during times of economic difficulty by reducing their spending, which further slows the economy. This paradox of thrift claimed that individual attempts <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> downturn only worsen it. When the demand for money increases, money velocity slows. A slowdown in economic activities means markets might not clear, leaving excess goods to waste and capacity to idle. Turning the quantity theory on its head, Keynes argued that market changes shift quantities rather than prices. Keynes replaced the assumption of stable velocity with one of a fixed price-level. If spending falls and prices do not, the surplus of goods reduces the need for workers and increases unemployment.|$|E
5|$|Survivalism and {{disaster}} preparation are prevalent {{themes in the}} novel. Several interviews, especially those from the United States, focus on policy changes designed to train the surviving U.S. population to fight the zombies and rebuild the country. For example, when cities were made to be as efficient as possible in order to fight the zombies, the plumber could hold a higher status than the former CEO. The ultra-rich hid in their homes, which {{had been turned into}} fortified compounds, when they were overwhelmed by others trying to get in, it became a mass slaughter. Throughout the novel, characters demonstrate the physical and mental requirements needed <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> disaster. Brooks described the large amount of research needed to find optimal methods for fighting a worldwide zombie outbreak. He also pointed out that the U.S. likes the zombie genre because it believes that it can survive anything with the right tools and talent.|$|E

5|$|The dam {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the 1950s; construction work commenced in 1968, involving the diversion of the North Fork American River through a tunnel {{and the construction of}} a massive earthen cofferdam. Following a nearby earthquake and the discovery of a seismic fault that underlay the dam site, work on the project was halted for fears that the dam's design would not allow it <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> major quake on the same fault zone. Although the dam was redesigned and a new proposal submitted by 1980, spiraling costs and limited economic justification {{put an end to the}} project until severe flooding in 1986 briefly renewed interest in Auburn's flood control potential. The California State Water Resources Control Board denied water rights for the dam project in 2008 due to lack of construction progress.|$|E
5|$|The player's character, the part-slug and {{part-cat}} Slugcat, uses {{spears and}} rocks <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> hostile, ruined, and obtuse 2D world {{in search of}} the family from whom it was separated. The player is given little explicit guidance and is free to explore the world in any direction via pipes and passages that pass through 1600 static screens, each with randomized enemies. The Slugcat can jump and use debris as weapons to avoid and hurt other creatures while foraging for sparse food, which is used to hibernate in scarce, designated safe rooms. Hibernation resets the day cycle and saves the player's progress. The player can move between regions by having the Slugcat hibernate multiple times without dying. If the player does not reach the hibernation point quickly, a crushing rain will pour, both flooding the world and possibly pummeling the Slugcat to death.|$|E
