5|$|Alternatively dsRNA can be {{supplied}} without genetic engineering. One {{approach is to}} add them to irrigation water. <b>The</b> <b>molecules</b> are absorbed into the plants' vascular system and poison insects feeding on them. Another approach involves spraying dsRNA like a conventional pesticide. This would allow faster adaptation to resistance. Such approaches would require low cost sources of dsRNAs that do not currently exist.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} ignores {{energy and}} deals {{only with the}} molecular complexity estimated by the information entropy index. It speculates that the points of several natural compounds (urea, pyrimidine, dihydroxyacetone, uracil, cytosine, glycine, and alanine) fall into {{the range of the}} values typical for the known interstellar molecules that indicates high probability of their detection in interstellar environment. Additionally <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> with maximal information entropy, i.e. the most complex compounds, make up approximately a half of the interstellar set and their percentage is decreased with the size. This trend may be associated with the different stabilities of <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> with uniform (usually more stable) and diversified (usually less stable) chemical structures, so the detectable molecules with a large size must possess symmetric structure more probably than non-symmetric. The remarkable detection of low-entropy (highly symmetric) fullerene molecules supports this assumption. It is also noted that information entropy reflects the depth of hydrogenation of interstellar entities: <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> with maximal information entropy are hydrogen-poor whereas the others are mainly hydrogen-rich.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} previously, <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> {{that underlie}} LTP {{can be classified}} as mediators or modulators. A mediator of LTP is a molecule, such as the NMDA receptor or calcium, whose presence and activity is necessary for generating LTP under nearly all conditions. By contrast, a modulator is a molecule that can alter LTP but is not essential for its generation or expression.|$|E

50|$|While intuitive, this {{classical}} picture {{does not}} take into account the quantum mechanical energy levels of <b>the</b> <b>molecule.</b> Quantum mechanically, <b>the</b> CARS process can be understood as follows. Our molecule is initially in the ground state, the lowest energy state of <b>the</b> <b>molecule.</b> <b>The</b> pump beam excites <b>the</b> <b>molecule</b> to a virtual state. A virtual state is not an eigenstate of <b>the</b> <b>molecule</b> and it can not be occupied but it does allow for transitions between otherwise uncoupled real states. If a Stokes beam is simultaneously present along with the pump, the virtual state can be used as an instantaneous gateway to address a vibrational eigenstate of <b>the</b> <b>molecule.</b> <b>The</b> joint action of the pump and the Stokes has effectively established a coupling between the ground state and the vibrationally excited state of <b>the</b> <b>molecule.</b> <b>The</b> <b>molecule</b> is now in two states at the same time: it resides in a coherent superposition of states. This coherence between the states can be probed by the probe beam, which promotes the system to a virtual state. Again, <b>the</b> <b>molecule</b> cannot stay in the virtual state and will fall back instantaneously to the ground state under the emission of a photon at the anti-Stokes frequency. <b>The</b> <b>molecule</b> is no longer in a superposition, as it resides again in one state, the ground state. In the quantum mechanical model, no energy is deposited in <b>the</b> <b>molecule</b> during <b>the</b> CARS process. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>molecule</b> acts like a medium for converting the frequencies of the three incoming waves into a CARS signal (a parametric process). There are, however, related coherent Raman processes that occur simultaneously which do deposit energy into <b>the</b> <b>molecule.</b>|$|R
50|$|The spherical {{structure}} is {{induced by the}} protein's tertiary structure. <b>The</b> <b>molecule's</b> apolar (hydrophobic) amino acids are bounded towards <b>the</b> <b>molecule's</b> interior whereas polar (hydrophilic) amino acids are bound outwards, allowing dipole-dipole interactions with the solvent, which explains <b>the</b> <b>molecule's</b> solubility.|$|R

5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> {{detected}} {{so far are}} organic. Only one inorganic {{species has}} been observed in molecules which contain at least five atoms, SiH4. Larger molecules have so far all {{had at least one}} carbon atom, with no N−N or O−O bonds.|$|E
5|$|Neon is monatomic, {{making it}} lighter than <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> of {{diatomic}} nitrogen and oxygen which form {{the bulk of}} Earth's atmosphere; a balloon filled with neon will rise in air, albeit more slowly than a helium balloon.|$|E
5000|$|Butyl {{methyl sulfide}} is an {{asymmetrical}} thioether which is achiral {{in the gas}} phase. <b>The</b> <b>molecule</b> can adsorbed to the surface through either of the sulfur's two lone pair.

The rotation of the motor can be controlled by adjusting the electron flux from the scanning tunneling microscope and the background temperature. The tip of the scanning electron microscope acts as an electrode. The chiralities of the tip of the STM and <b>the</b> <b>molecule</b> determine <b>the</b> rate and direction of rotation. Images taken of <b>the</b> <b>molecule</b> at 5 K and under non-perturbative scanning conditions show a crescent-shaped protrusion of <b>the</b> <b>molecule.</b> When <b>the</b> temperature is raised to 8 K, <b>the</b> <b>molecule</b> starts rotating along six orientations determined by the hexagonal structure of the copper it is adsorbed on. In this case, a STM image taken of <b>the</b> <b>molecule</b> appears as a hexagon as the timescale of the imaging is much slower than the rotation rate of <b>the</b> <b>molecule.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In some [...] "writing" [...] schemes, <b>the</b> tagged <b>molecule</b> {{ends up in}} {{an excited}} state.

5|$|The {{chiral nematic}} phase {{exhibits}} chirality (handedness). This phase {{is often called}} the cholesteric phase because it was first observed for cholesterol derivatives. Only chiral molecules (i.e., those that have no internal planes of symmetry) can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> tilted by a finite angle {{with respect to the}} layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{magnetic}} fields on liquid crystal molecules are analogous to electric fields.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{contrast}} {{formation in the}} local contact potential difference (LCPD) measured by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) on single charge-transfer complexes (CTCs) on a NaCl bilayer on Cu(111).

5|$|The smectics {{are thus}} {{positionally}} ordered along one direction. In the Smectic A phase, <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> are oriented along the layer normal, {{while in the}} Smectic C phase they are tilted away from it. These phases are liquid-like within the layers.

5|$|A {{particularly}} {{large and}} rich region for detecting interstellar molecules is Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2). This giant molecular cloud lies {{near the center}} of the Milky Way galaxy and is a frequent target for new searches. About half of <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> listed below were first found near Sgr B2, and nearly every other molecule has since been detected in this feature. A rich source of investigation for circumstellar molecules is the relatively nearby star CW Leonis (IRC +10216), where about 50 compounds have been identified.|$|E
5|$|Chiral phases {{usually have}} a helical {{twisting}} of <b>the</b> <b>molecules.</b> If the pitch of this twist is {{on the order of}} the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as polarization filters.|$|E
50|$|The intense {{coloring}} of <b>the</b> <b>molecule</b> {{is generated}} by the absorption of specific wavelengths of light by the pi bonds. These bonds are ordinarily excited by light in the orange region of the spectrum, causing <b>the</b> <b>molecule</b> to appear blue. When <b>the</b> <b>molecule</b> interacts with protons from an acid the bonds become harder to excite and thus absorb green light which has a shorter wavelength. This is what causes <b>the</b> <b>molecule</b> to appear red {{in the presence of}} an acid.|$|R
50|$|Reaction {{conditions}} for biotinylation are chosen so that <b>the</b> target <b>molecule</b> (e.g., an antibody) is labeled with sufficient biotin molecules to purify or detect <b>the</b> <b>molecule,</b> {{but not so}} much that the biotin interferes with the function of <b>the</b> <b>molecule.</b>|$|R

5|$|Interstellar {{molecules}} {{are formed}} by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar {{clouds of dust}} and gas. Usually this occurs when a molecule becomes ionized, often {{as the result of}} an interaction with a cosmic ray. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower. The dust plays a critical role of shielding <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.|$|E
5|$|It is {{extremely}} difficult to predict good conditions for nucleation or growth of well-ordered crystals. In practice, favorable conditions are identified by screening; a very large batch of <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> is prepared, and a wide variety of crystallization solutions are tested. Hundreds, even thousands, of solution conditions are generally tried before finding the successful one. The various conditions can use one or more physical mechanisms to lower the solubility of the molecule; for example, some may change the pH, some contain salts of the Hofmeister series or chemicals that lower the dielectric constant of the solution, and still others contain large polymers such as polyethylene glycol that drive the molecule out of solution by entropic effects. It is also common to try several temperatures for encouraging crystallization, or to gradually lower the temperature so that the solution becomes supersaturated. These methods require large amounts of the target molecule, as they use high concentration of <b>the</b> <b>molecule(s)</b> to be crystallized. Due to the difficulty in obtaining such large quantities (milligrams) of crystallization-grade protein, robots have been developed that are capable of accurately dispensing crystallization trial drops that are in the order of 100 nanoliters in volume. This means that 10-fold less protein is used per experiment when compared to crystallization trials set up by hand (in the order of 1 microliter).|$|E
5|$|Monosaccharides in a closed-chain form {{can form}} glycosidic bonds with other monosaccharides, {{creating}} disaccharides (such as sucrose) and polysaccharides (such as starch).

Many pentoses and hexoses can form ring structures. In these closed-chain forms, the aldehyde or ketone group remains non-free, {{so many of the}} reactions typical of these groups cannot occur.

5|$|Scientists and {{engineers}} {{are able to}} use liquid crystals {{in a variety of}} applications because external perturbation can cause significant changes in the macroscopic properties of the liquid crystal system.

5|$|Some animals {{including}} cephalopods like squid {{are able}} to vary their colours rapidly for both camouflage and signalling. The mechanisms include reversible proteins which can be switched between two configurations. The configuration of reflectin proteins in chromatophore cells in {{the skin of the}} Doryteuthis pealeii squid is controlled by electric charge. When charge is absent, the proteins stack together tightly, forming a thin, more reflective layer; when charge is present, <b>the</b> <b>molecules</b> stack more loosely, forming a thicker layer. Since chromatophores contain multiple reflectin layers, the switch changes the layer spacing and hence the colour of light that is reflected.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{director}} to align along an external field {{is caused by the}} electric nature of <b>the</b> <b>molecules.</b> Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of a molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge.
