One day this fox encountered the local hunt and ran to cover in the tree, to the amazement and consternation of the hunters and hounds. The housekeeper dislodged the poor animal, however it escaped the hunt and was back in its tree the following day as if nothing untoward had happened.|$|E
25|$|Jean de Lorme, Charles' father, {{was one of}} {{two doctors}} from Moulins that {{introduced}} Bourbon-Lancy as a spa town to Europe. Charles was the heir to his father's interest in the spa town, however for some unknown reason promoted the rival spa town of Bourbon-l'Archambault. Charles profited hugely from promoting the spa in this town. He was accused with the proverb d'avoir pris pension des habitants pour y faire aller bien du monde ("to have boarded the inhabitants in order to make <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>go</b> well") because of his enthusiasm for this rival spa. Charles gave the spa of Bourbon-l'Archambault its excellent reputation in the European upper class.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} festivals and festivities in Spain. Some {{of them are}} known worldwide, and every year {{millions}} of {{people from all over}} <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>go</b> to Spain to experience one of these festivals. One of the most famous is San Fermín, in Pamplona. While its most famous event is the encierro, or the running of the bulls, which happens at 8:00am from 7 to 14 July, the week-long celebration involves many other traditional and folkloric events. Its events were central to the plot of The Sun Also Rises, by Ernest Hemingway, which brought it to the general attention of English-speaking people. As a result, it {{has become one of the}} most internationally renowned fiestas in Spain, with over 1,000,000 people attending every year.|$|E
25|$|Percussionist Evelyn Glennie has {{collaborated with}} Björk {{and can be}} heard playing the marimba on Post and Telegram, as well as Oxygen. Thompson Twins {{included}} marimba in their many 1980s works. Jack White played marimba on The Nurse, a song on The White Stripes' album Get Behind Me Satan. In 2003, Marina Calzado Linage recorded an album bridging the gap between academic and popular music, Marimba de Buenos Aires, featuring music by Ástor Piazzolla. In 2009, Canadian musician Spencer Krug, working under the moniker Moonface, released a 20-minute continuous piece called Dreamland EP: Marimba And Shit-Drums with Jagjaguwar. The recording consists entirely of marimba, drums and vocals and comprises many movements and recurring themes. Vincent Montana Jr. played the marimba {{on one of the}} great socially conscious soul songs of the early 1970s People Make <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Go</b> Round by The Stylistics. The experimental band Coil (band) used the marimba in its later performances such as Selvaggina, Go Back into the Woods and studio albums The Ape of Naples and Black Antlers.|$|E
500|$|True Blue was {{the first}} album where Madonna {{included}} Spanish themes as evident in the song [...] "La Isla Bonita". The song was written for Michael Jackson's Bad album, but he had turned it down. While working with Leonard, Madonna accepted it in Jackson's place and re-wrote the lyrics, earning herself a co-writing credit. Madonna described it as her tribute to the [...] "beauty and mystery of Latin American people". Originally intended as the first single, [...] "Love Makes <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Go</b> Round" [...] – first performed at Live Aid a year earlier, in July 1985 – closes the album. The song recalled the antiwar music of the sixties.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically True Blue {{reflects}} Madonna's {{ideas about}} love. [...] "Where's the Party" [...] {{tells of a}} working girl enjoying the dancefloor after work. [...] "Jimmy Jimmy" [...] talks about Madonna's admiration for the neighbourhood bad boy. The Spanish [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] and [...] "Love Makes <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Go</b> Round" [...] deal with escapism from normal life, with the latter talking about anti-war and anti-poverty and using Latin drums and samba-influenced rhythms. [...] "White Heat" [...] deals with firmness and quotes Clint Eastwood's [...] "Make my day" [...] catchphrase. [...] "Papa Don't Preach"'s lyrics talk about {{a young woman who}} tells her father that she is pregnant out of wedlock, but is going to keep her baby.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the album's release, Madonna premiered [...] "Love Makes <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Go</b> Round" [...] at the 1985 Live Aid concert. The {{rest of the}} album's {{tracks were}} {{included}} on the setlist of her 1987 Who's That Girl World Tour except [...] "Jimmy Jimmy" [...] which remains still the only song from the album Madonna did not perform on any live appearance. It was her second concert tour and promoted True Blue alongside the film project Who's That Girl. It was Madonna's first world tour, reaching Asia, North America and Europe. Musically and technically superior to her previous Virgin Tour, the Who's That Girl tour incorporated multimedia components to make the show more appealing.|$|E
500|$|In early September 2001, media {{reported}} that Madonna had recorded two songs, [...] "Sex Makes <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Go</b> Round" [...] and [...] "Veronica Electronica", {{to be included}} on the forthcoming greatest hits album. The last title was from an unreleased remix album in collaboration with William Orbit. It was also {{reported that}} the album would be titled The Immaculate Collection 2. However, both the title and new songs rumors were proven false. After the final show of Madonna's Drowned World Tour on September 15, 2001, MTV News confirmed that the singer had planned to release a greatest hits album in November 2001. On October 4, 2001, Maverick Records eventually announced the track list of GHV2 {{as well as its}} official release date. The album coincided with the release of the DVD/VHS video album of the tour.|$|E

500|$|The album {{continues}} with [...] "La La", a song with sexual lyrics that Simpson has described as [...] "tongue-in-cheek". One reviewer described [...] "La La" [...] as a [...] "punk inspired, fast beat, screaming anthem". [...] "Love Makes <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Go</b> Round", which epinions.com {{described as having}} a [...] "Duff vibe", talks about the disappointment of an ending relationship.

[...] In 1994, The Oregonian reported that O'Donnell regarded Weather Machine with a [...] "mixture of wonder and embarrassment" [...] and stated that he [...] " [...] think it's all that attractive".

500|$|Tolle recalls {{going out}} for a walk in London the next morning, and finding that “everything was miraculous, deeply peaceful. Even the traffic." [...] The feeling continued, and he began to feel a strong {{underlying}} sense of peace in any situation. He stopped studying for his doctorate, and for a period of about two years after this he spent much of his time sitting, “in a state of deep bliss," [...] on park benches in Russell Square, Central London, [...] "watching <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>go</b> by.” He stayed with friends, in a Buddhist monastery, or otherwise slept rough on Hampstead Heath. His family thought him “irresponsible, even insane." [...] He changed his first name from Ulrich to Eckhart; by some reports this was in homage to the German philosopher and mystic, Meister Eckhart. A 2012 interview article states that he saw the name Eckhart on one of a pile of books in a dream, and knew he had written the book; soon after in real life he ran into a psychic friend who called him Eckhart out of nowhere, so he changed his name.|$|E

500|$|The tour {{received}} positive {{reviews and}} critical acclaim. Cory Moss from MTV wrote that [...] "music might make <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>go</b> round, but costumes and theatrics {{make it more}} fun. Nobody knows this better than the Material Girl." [...] Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH commented that [...] "you'd struggle {{to find a better}} show than Drowned World and you'd find it difficult to find a mainstream artist who can command near-universal respect for anything like as long as this fine lady. One could almost judge the artist by what was left out [...] she displayed that temptress quality which has beguiled us for nearly two decades and that, combined with her exquisite music, is why Madonna is so special." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote: [...] "Though her Cowgirl image is easily her least significant incarnation to date, Drowned World proves that Madonna is still unmatched in her ability to lift cultural iconography into the mainstream. [...] Those who thought Madonna hung up her handcuffs along with the notorious Sex book should look again closely. With its themes of chaos, dominance, and, ultimately, celebration, Madonna's Drowned World explores her ever-fervid intrigue with both imposed and pious restraint." ...|$|E
500|$|San Francisco's Dead Kennedys made {{a career}} out of {{mentioning}} Reagan in songs like [...] "Moral Majority," [...] "We've Got a Bigger Problem Now," [...] "Bleed for Me," [...] and the track [...] "Kinky Sex Makes <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Go</b> Round," [...] a spoken word piece about World War III formatted as an erotic phone call between Margaret Thatcher and Reagan's fictitious Secretary of War. [...] The band's 1986 studio album, Bedtime for Democracy, is a play on Reagan's film Bedtime for Bonzo and features a multitude of songs about Reagan. [...] "Potshot Heard Round the World" [...] is about U.S. military actions in the Middle East, [...] "with Reagans and Gaddafis cast as cartoon villains and heroes." [...] Reagan plays the title role in the song, [...] "Rambozo the Clown," [...] a portmanteau of Sylvester Stallone's Rambo franchise and Bozo the Clown from children's daytime TV. The Dead Kennedys were done in by a lawsuit against their inclusion of H. R. Giger's Penis Landscape painting as an insert the album Frankenchrist. Singer Jello Biafra chose to include in the album the first time he saw it, saying, [...] "“This picture is like Reagan America on parade." ...|$|E
