5000|$|... 13 October 2007: A Oerlikon GDF Mk.5 35 mm {{anti-aircraft}} <b>twin-barrelled</b> <b>gun</b> malfunctioned, spraying {{hundreds of}} high-explosive 0,5kg 35mm cannon shells around the five-gun firing position. By {{the time the}} gun had emptied its dual 250-round magazines nine soldiers were dead and eleven injured. The accident occurred just before 9 am, when a battery from 10 Anti-Aircraft Regiment began a live-fire exercise at the Army Combat Training Centre at Lohatlha {{as part of the}} SANDF's Exercise Seboka.|$|E
50|$|Two Shtil {{surface-to-air missile}} systems are installed, each on the raised deck behind the <b>twin-barrelled</b> 130 mm <b>guns.</b> Shtil is the export {{name of the}} SA-N-7, NATO {{reporting}} name Gadfly. (From the 9th ship onwards, same launcher is used for SA-17 Grizzly/SA-N-12 Yezh.) The system uses the ship's three-dimensional circular scan radar for target tracking. Up to three missiles can be aimed simultaneously. The range is up to 30 km against targets with speeds up to 830 m/s. The ship carries 48 Shtil missiles.|$|R
5000|$|During the Soviet war in Afghanistan, Soviet convoys were {{frequently}} ambushed by Afghan mujahideen guerillas. The rebel groups often sited their ambush parties on surrounding heights, above the maximum {{elevation of the}} main weapons of the tanks and APCs employed as convoy escorts. As a stop-gap solution to this problem, the Soviets fitted <b>twin-barrelled</b> ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft <b>guns</b> onto Kamaz trucks, with tents to camouflage the armaments. These vehicles possessed extreme firepower, but they lacked armour, and the crew were exposed to machine-gun and small-arms fire.|$|R
2500|$|One Surface Action Group, or SAG, {{consisting}} of the destroyers [...] (including embarked LAMPS MK I Helicopter Detachment HSL-35 Det 1) and , plus the amphibious transport dock [...] and its embarked Marine Air-Ground Task Force (Contingency MAGTF 2-88 from Camp LeJeune, NC) and the LAMPS (Light Airborne MultiPurpose System) Helicopter Detachment (HSL-44 Det 5) from USS Samuel B. Roberts, was ordered to destroy the guns and other military facilities on the Sassan oil platform. At 8am, the SAG commander, who was also the commander of Destroyer Squadron 9, ordered the Merrill to radio a warning to the occupants of the platform, telling them to abandon it. The SAG waited 20 minutes, then opened fire. The oil platform fired back with <b>twin-barrelled</b> 23mm ZU-23 <b>guns.</b> The SAG's guns eventually disabled some of the ZU-23s, and platform occupants radioed {{a request for a}} cease-fire. The SAG complied. After a tug carrying more personnel had cleared the area, the ships resumed exchanging fire with the remaining ZU-23s, and ultimately disabled them. Cobra helicopters completed the destruction of enemy resistance. The Marines boarded the platform, and recovered a single wounded survivor (who was transported to Bahrain), some small arms, and intelligence. The Marines planted explosives, left the platform, and detonated them. The SAG was then ordered to proceed north to the Rakhsh oil platform to destroy it.|$|R
