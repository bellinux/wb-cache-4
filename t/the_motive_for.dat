5|$|In late June 2006, before Booker took office, New Jersey {{investigators}} foiled a plot {{to assassinate}} Booker led by Bloods gang leaders inside four New Jersey state prisons. <b>The</b> <b>motive</b> <b>for</b> the plot was unclear, but was described variously {{as a response to}} the acrimonious campaign and to Booker's campaign promises to take a harder line on crime.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}. Chair Heflin was upset by the leaks and two investigations into them were held, one by the General Accounting Office {{acting on behalf of}} the committee and one by the Senate's Temporary Special Independent Counsel. Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as <b>the</b> <b>motive</b> <b>for</b> the leaks and said they were intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E
5|$|After the trial, doubts {{were raised}} {{about both the}} story of the {{stepmother}}'s dreams and the fate of Maria and William's child. The stepmother was only a year older than Maria, and it was suggested that she and Corder had been having an affair and that the two had planned the murder to dispose of Maria so that it could continue without hindrance. Her dreams had started only a few days after Corder married Moore, and it was suggested that jealousy was <b>the</b> <b>motive</b> <b>for</b> revealing the body's resting place and that the dreams were a simple subterfuge.|$|E

40|$|We use pre-offer market valuations {{to examine}} <b>the</b> <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> takeovers under <b>the</b> misvaluation theory.

We find that overvalued acquirers paying by cash have <b>the</b> <b>motives</b> of synergy and hubris. However, overvalued acquirers paying by stock have <b>the</b> <b>motives</b> of agency and hubris. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>motive</b> of undervalued acquirers paying by cash is only hubris. Lastly, <b>the</b> <b>motives</b> of those undervalued acquirers paying by stock are synergy and hubris. In this study, we provide the empirical {{evidence to show}} that acquirers' stock misevaluation and their payment methods will differentiate <b>the</b> <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> takeovers.

5|$|Little {{is known}} of Eorpwald's life or of his short reign, as little {{documentary}} evidence about the East Anglian kingdom has survived. The primary source for Eorpwald is the Ecclesiastical History of the English People, written by Bede in the 8th century. Soon after becoming king, Eorpwald received Christian teaching and was baptised in 627 or 632. Soon after his conversion {{he was killed by}} Ricberht, a pagan noble, who may have succeeded him and ruled for three years. <b>The</b> <b>motive</b> <b>for</b> Eorpwald's assassination was probably political as well as religious. He was the first early English king to suffer death as a consequence of his Christian faith and was subsequently venerated by the Church as a saint and martyr.|$|E

25|$|Historians differ over <b>the</b> <b>motive</b> <b>for</b> his {{conversion}} to Islam.

Despite {{his conversion}} to Islam, his works continued to be studied at the Jewish Baghdad Academy, a well-known academy, into the thirteenth century. He was a follower of Avicenna's teaching, who proposed an explanation of the acceleration of falling bodies by the accumulation of successive increments of power with successive increments of velocity.|$|E
40|$|Cooperative {{activity}} between firms {{has become}} necessary {{due to high}} uncertainty and turbulence in the competitive sphere. The limitations and inadequacies of individual firms in competing in increasingly global markets, with rapidly changing technologies and requirement of investment funds to supply new products with ever shortening life-cycles is pushing more firms towards cooperative arrangements. While substantial {{research has been conducted}} on the subject, most of <b>the</b> <b>motives</b> brought out are from the perspective of firms in developed countries that cooperate to achieve competitive advantage. The last decade has witnessed firms in less developed countries rapidly developing collaborative arrangements for conducting business. India too, has witnessed a rising trend in collaborative arrangements during the past few years, which evoked interest in finding <b>the</b> <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> such strategies. Publicly announced collaborative arrangements in India indicated that on an average about fifty agreements are taking place every month, of which two-thirds are cross border agreements. While there is substantial research on <b>the</b> <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> collaborative arrangements in developed countries, <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> partner in the less developed countries have received limited attention. This paper attempts to identify <b>the</b> <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> collaborative arrangements of an Indian firm, Cyber Media, South Asia’s largest specialty print media company. It analyzes a series of collaborative arrangements of Cyber Media to draw insights and deepen the understanding of <b>the</b> <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> such arrangements...|$|R

40|$|Shared service centers (SSCs) {{have gained}} the {{interest}} of politicians and public administrations to improve efficiency. By unbundling and centralizing activities, the basic premise for SSCs {{seems to be that}} services provided by one local department can be provided to others with relatively few efforts. The introduction of a SSC is a major decision having a long-term impact on all the participants and is often competing with outsourcing arrangements. As such it is of essential importance to get a better understanding of <b>the</b> <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> introducing SSCs. <b>The</b> <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> introducing a SSC in public administration are presented and discussed in this paper. First, by means of investigating an existing SSC in time, <b>the</b> initial <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> introducing a SSC have been compared with the accomplished benefits after realizing the SSC. The introduction of a SSC was driven by a series of complex, interrelated motives. Second, because SSCs can be regarded as a specific kind of sourcing arrangement, <b>the</b> <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> establishing a SSC have been compared with <b>the</b> <b>motives</b> associated with outsourcing as found in literature. This should help decision-makers in making a tradeoff between SSCs and other sourcing arrangements...|$|R

Khan denied ordering her murder and stated his intention was to have her kidnapped and tortured, not murdered. <b>The</b> <b>motive</b> <b>for</b> this was Ashraf's refusal to marry him.

25|$|Kiarostami's {{first film}} of the decade was Close-Up (1990), which narrates {{the story of the}} real-life trial of a man who {{impersonated}} film-maker Mohsen Makhmalbaf, conning a family into believing they would star in his new film. The family suspects theft as <b>the</b> <b>motive</b> <b>for</b> this charade, but the impersonator, Hossein Sabzian, argues that his motives were more complex. The part-documentary, part-staged film examines Sabzian's moral justification for usurping Makhmalbaf's identity, questioning his ability to sense his cultural and artistic flair. Ranked #42 in British Film Institute's The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time, Close-Up received praise from directors such as Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, Werner Herzog, Jean-Luc Godard, and Nanni Moretti and was released across Europe.|$|E

25|$|Investigators and the {{prosecution}} suggested during pre-trial motions that Muhammad intended to kill his second ex-wife Mildred, who had estranged him from his children.

Muhammad frequented the neighborhood where she lived during the attacks, and some of the incidents occurred nearby. Additionally, he had earlier made threats against her. Mildred herself made the claim that she was his intended target. However, Judge LeRoy Millette, Jr. prevented prosecutors from presenting that theory during the trial, saying that a link had not been firmly established.|$|E
