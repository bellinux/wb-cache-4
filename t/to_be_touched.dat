5|$|The demonologist Pierre de Lancre (1553–1631) {{boasted that}} even dead French monarchs could heal; it was, indeed, still {{believed}} in the 16th century that the healing power was retained by Saint Louis IX's arm, preserved in Poblet Monastery in Catalonia. In order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> by the French king, people traveled from as far off as the present-day Italy and Spain already in the 13th century. The foreigners were ranked in a specific order, with the Spanish taking precedence over all others and the king's own subjects coming last.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{non-contact}} variants of American football, such as flag football. In flag football the ballcarrier is not tackled; instead, defenders aim {{to pull a}} flag tied around his waist. Another variant, touch football, simply requires the ballcarrier <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> to be considered downed. A game of touch football may require that the player be touched with either one or two hands to be considered down, depending on the rules used.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} Neku {{by performing}} touchscreen actions {{based on the}} currently equipped pins. These actions may include slashing across an enemy, tapping the screen rapidly to fire bullets, holding down on an enemy to inflict damage or shouting into the microphone to cause a full screen attack. Other pins need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> to activate them, such as for health restoration. Each pin has {{a limited number of}} uses before it must recharge for a certain time. Other pins may only be used a fixed number of times during a series of battles, and do not recharge until the battle sequence is over. Neku can only be equipped with a maximum of two pins at the game's start; this can eventually be upgraded to a maximum of six.|$|E

5|$|Docile and slow-moving, zebra {{sharks are}} not {{dangerous}} to humans {{and can be}} easily approached underwater. However, they have bitten divers who pull on their tails or attempt to ride them. As of 2008 there is one record of an unprovoked attack in the International Shark Attack File, though no injuries resulted. They are popular attractions for ecotourist divers in the Red Sea, off the Maldives, off Thailand's Phuket and Phi Phi islands, on the Great Barrier Reef, and elsewhere. Many zebra sharks at diving sites have become accustomed {{to the presence of}} humans, taking food from divers' hands and allowing themselves <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>touched.</b> The zebra shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed by a number of public aquaria around the world. The small, attractively colored young also find their way into the hands of private hobbyists, though this species grows far too large for the home aquarium.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor, River, Amy, and Rory {{suddenly}} {{find themselves}} near the TARDIS in a New York graveyard back in 2012, Rory's plan having worked. As the four prepare to depart, Rory catches {{sight of a}} tombstone with his name on it. He is then touched by a surviving, albeit weakened, Angel and sent into the past. The Doctor is unable to take the TARDIS back to get him, due to the paradox Rory and Amy created. Amy refuses to be parted from Rory and willingly allows herself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> by the same Angel {{in the hopes of}} being sent back to the same time as he was. Her name then appears along with Rory's on the tombstone. The Doctor is distraught, but River reminds him that while their fates are now sealed, Amy likely published the Melody Malone book in the past and may have left him a message. The Doctor races back to where they had their picnic and recovers the final page, finding the afterword written by Amy to him. Amy explains that she and Rory lived out a good and happy life for themselves, and asks the Doctor to visit her childhood self to assure her that he will come back for her to take her on amazing journeys. The episode ends with a young Amelia Pond sitting in her back garden, then looking up and smiling as the TARDIS engines are heard.|$|E

25|$|The most {{prominent}} rape storyline began in December 2006, when Crane heiress and police cadet Fancy Crane was raped during a sting operation designed {{to catch a}} peeping tom. The brutal attack left Fancy in a brief coma and emotionally traumatized the young woman. Fancy was also the show's first rape victim to visibly experience prolonged effects; her bubbly demeanor disappeared, and she became extremely nervous and could not stand <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> for several months. Fancy was eventually raped {{for a second time}} in January 2007, and her boyfriend, Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald, was framed for the crimes; the rapist was later revealed to be Vincent Clarkson, Fancy's paternal half-brother through their father.|$|E

500|$|Cosima and Blandine {{remained}} with Anna Liszt until 1850, joined eventually by Daniel. Cosima's biographer George Marek describes Anna as [...] "a simple, uneducated, unworldly but warmhearted woman ... {{for the first}} time [...] experienced what it was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> by love". Of the sisters, Blandine was evidently the prettier; Cosima, with her long nose and wide mouth was described as an [...] "ugly duckling". Although Liszt's relations with his children were formal and distant, he provided for them liberally, and ensured that they were well educated. Both girls were sent to Madame Bernard's, an exclusive boarding school, while Daniel was prepared for the prestigious Lycée Bonaparte.|$|E
500|$|Mansukhani later {{added the}} gay storyline {{because he thought}} it was an issue that needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> on. However, the {{director}} did not want the film to be serious or preachy: [...] "I also realise that when you preach via cinema nobody wants to hear it". [...] "The film has a message, if you get it, great. If you don’t, no problem, sit back, relax and enjoy the film", he said about making Dostana a romantic comedy. In February 2008, Johar announced the film's title; the producer named it after a 1980 film produced by his father, Yash Johar. Asked if his film was also a love triangle, he replied: [...] "Well, yes and no. Though it's a love story, there's a never-before twist in the tale. All I can say on record is that we've never had a love triangle like this before." [...] The gay storyline was not disclosed until the trailers were released. Manan Sagar was hired to edit the film, and the duo Salim–Sulaiman composed the background score.|$|E
500|$|Capper had not died {{immediately}} as her murderers believed, {{and after}} they left she managed to scramble back up the embankment and stagger along the lane for approximately {{a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) to Compstall Road before being found at 06:10 by Barry Sutcliffe and two of his colleagues on their way to work. She told them: [...] "Over there, in the field. They burnt me, they put petrol on me." [...] They immediately took her to a nearby house and roused the residents, Michael and Margaret Coop, to call for an ambulance. Michael Coop said: [...] "Both her hands appeared like ash. Her legs were just like raw meat and her feet appeared to be badly charred. I was struck by how polite the victim was. She was constantly thanking my wife for her assistance." [...] Margaret Coop said: [...] "I instinctively went to put my arms around her but she pulled away because she could not bear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>touched.</b> Her head was shaved and there were recent, not new, cuts to her head. Her face was almost featureless. Her hands were red raw and black at the fingertips. Her legs were red from top to bottom. She couldn't bear anything near her legs." [...] Capper drank six glasses of water, but was unable to hold the glass herself because of the injuries to her hands. Margaret Coop said: [...] "She looked like the victim of an attack in the Vietnam war. But I felt she would survive. I had this theory that, now she had got to somewhere she could be helped, she would live." [...] Capper was rushed to the hospital and was able to give the names of her six assailants and Powell's address before falling into a coma. The extent of her burns was such that her mother and stepfather were unable to recognise her, and she was positively identified by a partial fingerprint from her thumb, the only part of her hands not severely burned. She died on 18 December 1992, without regaining consciousness.|$|E

[...] A reviewer for Next Generation commented on the game's surreal content and heavy concern [...] "with ethics, humanity, and inner demons", but found the gameplay too limited, and summarized it as [...] "less a game than an ethical obstacle course". According to Computer Games Strategy Plus, [...] "without appearing didactic, Ellison has the ability to hit us squarely in the face with a mirror reflecting the sorry lot that we humans have become.
