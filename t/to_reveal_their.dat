5|$|Arsenal {{announced}} their team {{two days before}} the match, recalling Cliff Holton who had recovered from injury. Blackpool refused <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> <b>their</b> team until the evening of 12 October, but manager Joe Smith did confirm to the press that Matthews would start.|$|E
5|$|Stela 28 and Stela 29 were {{erected in}} 623 {{and are the}} {{earliest}} monuments to survive from Late Classic Calakmul. They depict a royal couple but the texts are too poorly preserved <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> <b>their</b> names.|$|E
5|$|Regularity {{and order}} are common {{features}} in Toraja wood carving (see table below), {{as well as}} abstracts and geometrical designs. Nature is frequently {{used as the basis}} of Toraja's ornaments, because nature is full of abstractions and geometries with regularities and ordering. Toraja's ornaments have been studied in ethnomathematics <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> <b>their</b> mathematical structure, but Torajans base this art only on approximations. To create an ornament, bamboo sticks are used as a geometrical tool.|$|E

5|$|The series {{concerns}} Phineas's {{attempts to}} avoid boredom by finding {{something new to}} do for each day of his summer vacation. His sister's name is Candace Flynn, who tries <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> <b>their</b> outrageous creations, but to no avail. He does this with his less-talkative stepbrother Ferb, and often with many other neighborhood children. The activities they devise usually involve outlandish contraptions, including roller coasters, haunted houses, roller rinks, and a backyard beach etc. which Phineas designs and Ferb builds.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the fastest insect runners and, at full speed, adopt a bipedal run to reach a high {{velocity}} in proportion to their body size. As cockroaches move very quickly, {{they need to be}} video recorded at several hundred frames per second <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> <b>their</b> gait. More sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks (Phasmatodea). A few insects have evolved to walk {{on the surface of the}} water, especially members of the Gerridae family, commonly known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species.|$|E
5|$|Of the 24 Asian-American awardees, 21 {{earned the}} Medal while serving with the 442nd Regimental Combat Team or its {{component}} unit, the 100th Infantry Battalion, making the 442nd the most decorated regiment-sized {{unit of the}} war. Only two Asian-American officers received the Medal of Honor during World War II: Captain Francis B. Wai who received it for drawing enemy fire to himself <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> <b>their</b> positions and Second Lieutenant Daniel Inouye who received his medal for destroying two machine gun nests and continuing to fight after being wounded. Inouye became the first U.S. Representative for Hawaii and the first Japanese American congressman; he served as one of Hawaii's U.S. Senators from 1963 continuously {{until his death in}} 2012.|$|E
5000|$|The story also {{centers on}} another eight characters, the [...] "Eight Enigmas" [...] (八奇), {{a group of}} elite {{military}} strategists trained by Sima Hui, who {{is also known as}} Shuijing (水鏡). They comprise Yuan Fang (a fictional character), Xun Yu, Jia Xu, Guo Jia, Zhou Yu, Pang Tong, Zhuge Liang, and an unknown eighth member. Each of the Eight Enigmas has his motivation for choosing a ruler to follow, and some chapters are devoted <b>to</b> <b>revealing</b> <b>their</b> ultimate intents and moral stances.|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{regulation}} of the commons requires information about the regulated firms that is rarely available to regulators (e. g., cost of pollution abatement). Montero (2008) proposes a simple mechanism for inducing firms <b>to</b> truthfully <b>reveal</b> <b>their</b> privatExternalities, asymmetric information, uniform-price auction...|$|R
50|$|In early 2012, she {{launched}} her next book, Legacy, (Random House India) {{a collection of}} letters to their daughters from eminent Indian men and women. The book provided a rare insight into the minds of these leaders who set aside <b>their</b> public images <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> daughters the lessons that they learnt along their own journeys and the values that they adopted to lead a responsible and fulfilled life.|$|R
5|$|Back at UNITY's headquarters, Cate is congratulated for {{a mission}} well done, and {{everybody}} leaves to grab some rest. Cate {{arrives at a}} graveyard where Bruno was buried to pay her respects. She is then confronted by the supposedly long-dead Tom Goodman, who reveals {{that he is the}} real traitor within UNITY, and a final gun duel ensues. Cate manages to injure Tom and arrest him, but Smith shoots Tom, causing him to fall into a freshly dug grave. Smith then tries to shoot Cate as well, but Jones shoots Smith and reveals that Bruno is still alive. Smith attempts his one last effort to shoot Cate, but Cate kills Smith just in time. With Tom and Smith shot dead, Jones and Bruno decide to tell Cate the truth; Bruno falsified his death so that Cate and the rest of UNITY could find the real traitor. Seven years ago, Smith was taken out of the field by UNITY due to his inadequate fieldwork. In order to sabotage UNITY as a way to avenge himself, Smith joins H.A.R.M. to kill the real Tom Goodman, and replace him with an impostor. When Cate's investigation initially foiled H.A.R.M.'s plan, both Smith and his mole were forced <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> <b>their</b> true intentions. Cate reacts in shock upon finding out the truth.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} match, competitors Shawn Michaels and Rick Martel were unable, {{due to a}} pre-match stipulation, to hit {{each other in the}} face. The two men exchanged holds but were both preoccupied with looking to ringside for approval from Sensational Sherri. Martel gained the advantage by throwing Michaels to the outside of the ring and attacking him there. When the two returned to the ring, they took turns attempting to pin their opponent, pulling down their opponent's wrestling tights <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> <b>their</b> buttocks each time. Michaels then kicked Martel and tried to pin him, but the referee stopped the three-count because Michaels' feet were on the ropes. Both wrestlers broke the pre-match stipulation by slapping each other in the face. Sherri pretended to faint, which drew the attention of both wrestlers. Michaels and Martel argued over who would carry Sherri backstage, with each man carrying her a few feet before being stopped by his opponent. Both wrestlers were counted out, but they continued to argue. Martel tried to revive Sherri by throwing water on her, but he hit Michaels as well. Michaels dropped Sherri and chased Martel backstage; upset at being left behind by both men, Sherri screamed and cried as she walked backstage.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 the {{zoologist}} Joel Asaph Allen {{discovered the}} remains of Canis mississippiensis (Allen 1876) and associated these with C.dirus (Leidy 1858) and Canis indianensis (Leidy 1869). As so little was found of these three specimens, Allen thought it best to leave each specimen listed under its provisional name until more material could be found <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> <b>their</b> relationship. In 1908 the paleontologist John Campbell Merriam began retrieving numerous fossilized bone fragments of a large wolf from the Rancho LaBrea tar pits. By 1912 {{he had found a}} skeleton sufficiently complete to be able to formally recognize these and the previously found specimens under the name C.dirus (Leidy 1858). Because the rules of nomenclature stipulated that the name of a species should be the oldest name ever applied to it, Merriam therefore selected the name of Leidy's 1858 specimen, C.dirus. In 1915 the paleontologist Edward Troxell indicated his agreement with Merriam when he declared C.indianensis a synonym of C.dirus. In 1918, after studying these fossils, Merriam proposed consolidating their names under the separate genus Aenocyon (from Aenos, terrible and cyon, wolf) to become Aenocyon dirus, but not everyone agreed with this extinct wolf being placed in a new genus separate from the genus Canis. Canis ayersi (Sellards 1916) and Aenocyon dirus (Merriam 1918) were recognized as synonyms of C.dirus by the paleontologist Ernest Lundelius in 1972. All of the above taxa were declared synonyms of C.dirus in 1979, according to the paleontologist Ronald M. Nowak.|$|E

25|$|Everyone {{can help}} {{educate the public}} by {{encouraging}} safe practices, and by avoiding dangerous ones. Unfortunately, even well-known players are known to incite users to hazardous behavior, e.g. by requesting their users <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> <b>their</b> passwords for third party services, such as email.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{standardized}} systems for categorising dysplasia, set out by respective reputable bodies (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals/OFA, PennHIP, British Veterinary Association/BVA). Some {{of these tests}} require manipulation of the hip joint into standard positions, in order <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> <b>their</b> condition on an X-ray.|$|E
25|$|Apart from this, they do {{have little}} {{authority}} over normal citizens as they may only ask a person to hold on, briefly interrogate them, ask them <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> <b>their</b> identity (comparable to a Terry Stop) or to leave the area if {{they appear to be}} dangerous (Platzverweis under §31 HSOG).|$|E
50|$|In April 1981, Regan {{obtained}} {{transcripts of}} telephone calls made by Prince Charles in Australia to Lady Diana Spencer, then his fiancée. In addition <b>to</b> <b>revealing</b> <b>their</b> intimate conversation, Charles {{could be heard}} making disparaging remarks about Malcolm Fraser, then Prime Minister of Australia, and about some aspects of Australian culture. They were bought by Die Aktuelle, a German magazine; the Prince and Lady Diana obtained an injunction preventing Regan from disclosing or publishing {{the contents of the}} transcripts, but Die Aktuelle was not affected and published the transcripts on 8 May despite a German court having also injuncted them against publication.|$|R

30|$|The Manchus of the Qing Dynasty did not transgress the old road of the Northern tribes {{entering}} the Central Plains. This {{is the history}} of our recent memory, so we need not say more. Before the liberation, I had not heard that the linguist Luo Changpei and the writer Lao She were Manchurian. They both became open about their ethnic origins only after the liberation. Of course, we Han coexisted with them without ever sensing any sort of difference between us. Prior <b>to</b> <b>revealing</b> <b>their</b> ethnic origins, they knew that they were Manchurian. This again demonstrates that the multi-ethnic component of the unified nation is stubbornly persistent.|$|R
25|$|The {{effect of}} state {{repression}} was worse {{on the student}} movement: the AEU ended decimated. Despite all this, the association {{continued to be a}} belligerent organization during this campaign of terror. To protect themselves, the AEU restructured its organizational form such that their leaders were not so vulnerable, and declined <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> <b>their</b> names.|$|E
25|$|In a {{continued}} attempt {{to contain the}} row, Stephen Lam said on 16 June that the future appointees would be contractually bound <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> <b>their</b> salaries and be advised to disclose their nationalities. He also stated that their pay could be adjusted upwards or downwards, and that their contracts could be terminated on one month's notice.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} feature, {{compared to}} other Danish parties, is that the Danish People's Party is usually underrepresented by about 1-1.5% in opinion polls. Election researchers {{have suggested that the}} party's voters may be less interested in politics, and therefore declining to talk to pollsters, or that voters are reluctant <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> <b>their</b> support for the party to pollsters.|$|E
40|$|Empirical {{studies of}} {{innovation}} {{have found that}} end users frequently develop important product and process innovations. Defying conventional wisdom on {{the negative effects of}} uncompensated spillovers, innovative users also often openly <b>reveal</b> <b>their</b> innovations <b>to</b> all users and manufacturers. Rival users are thus in a position to reproduce the innovation in-house and benefit from using it, and manufacturers {{are in a position to}} refine the innovation and sell it to all users, including competitors of the user revealing its innovation. In this paper we explore the incentives that users might have <b>to</b> freely <b>reveal</b> <b>their</b> proprietary innovations. We develop a game-theoretic model to explore the effect of these incentives on users' decisions <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> or hide <b>their</b> proprietary information. We find that, under realistic parameter constellations, free revealing pays. We conclude by discussing some implications of our findings...|$|R
50|$|Akrura Ghat {{is one of}} the bathing ghats at Vrindavan, Mathura district. This is {{the place}} where Lord Krishna and Lord Balarama are {{believed}} <b>to</b> have <b>revealed</b> <b>their</b> forms of Lord Vishnu and Sesha Naga to Akrura. The text Adi Varaha Purana illustrates Akrura Ghat as the king of all holy places.|$|R
50|$|The spoken {{language}} of the Shadows is a rapid series of high-frequency bursts and chirps like a cricket or grasshopper. According {{to one of their}} human emissaries, the endonym of the Shadows is ten thousand letters long, and unpronounceable by many; but this may simply be a lie <b>to</b> avoid <b>revealing</b> <b>their</b> actual name.|$|R
