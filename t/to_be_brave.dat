5|$|The {{four main}} {{characters}} of Children of Mana are Ferrik, Tamber, Poppen, and Wanderer. They all {{live together in}} the Mana Village, near the Mana Tree. Ferrik is a fifteen-year-old boy who is said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brave,</b> bright and cheerful. He lost his parents and sister in the great disaster. After his life was saved by a knight, he has been honing his skills with the sword. Tamber is a sixteen-year-old girl, {{with a sense of}} truth and justice, and an air of maturity about her. She lost her parents and little brother due to the great disaster. Tamber's weapon of choice is the bow. Poppen is a nine-year-old boy, who is stubborn and fearless. He lost his mother at birth and his father in the great disaster. Poppen's weapon of choice is the flail. Wanderer is a traveling merchant, a tradition kept throughout the series. He {{is a member of the}} Niccolo tribe of rabbit/cat people who lost his family due to the king of Lorimar during the great disaster. Wanderer's weapon of choice is the hammer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the temple}} with Nourabad, Leila expresses fear at being left alone, but Nourabad exhorts her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brave</b> and to fulfil her vows to Brahma on pain {{of her own}} death. She tells him of the courage she once {{displayed}} when, as a child, she had hidden a fugitive from his enemies and refused to give him up even when threatened with death (""). The fugitive had rewarded her with a necklace that he asked her always to wear. She had kept this promise, as she would her vows. On the priest's departure, Leila quietly muses on the former times when she and Nadir would meet together secretly (""). Nadir then enters; in her fear of Nourabad's threats Leila begs him to leave, but he remains and the two declare their love in a passionate duet (""). He goes, promising to return next night, but as he leaves he is captured by the fishermen and {{brought back to the}} temple. Zurga, as the fishermen's leader, at first resists the fishermen's calls for Nadir's execution and advocates mercy. However, after Nourabad removes Leila's veil, Zurga recognises her as his former love; consumed by jealousy and rage, he orders that both Nadir and Leila be put to death. A violent storm erupts, as the fishermen unite in singing a hymn to Brahma ("Brahma divin Brahma!").|$|E

25|$|Kala (Susanne Blakeslee) - If his woes {{become too}} great or his {{thoughts}} too burdensome, Tarzan seeks seclusion and the calm council of his gorilla mother, Kala. A sympathetic ear when Tarzan needs someone wise to talk to, Kala {{acts as the}} voice of the apes, always reminding Tarzan of his unique obligations to the family. She is also Jane's closest confidant. The two share a warm, strong bond, and Jane regards her mother-in-law as her only kindred spirit in the jungle. From Kala's point of view, Jane is the human daughter she never had. Kala was Kerchak's mate, and perhaps the only one besides Tarzan that ever openly defied him without repercussions. Her open mind is a well of great wisdom and she is almost always right. Even though Kerchak is gone, she is still highly respected. Although kind and motherly to Tarzan, Jane, and all the gorillas, Kala is almost undoubtedly the bravest gorilla in the family. When the family was trapped in a cave by Tublat, Kala bravely stood up to the villain, and encouraged all the other gorillas <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brave</b> as well. Her presence and support keeps the family together and ensures that they are always there for each other even in the most dire situations.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi [...] "Maya" [...] Arulpragasam) {{had worked}} {{exclusively}} in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she {{was introduced to the}} Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brave</b> and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success.|$|E
500|$|The {{mushroom}} is edible, but {{removal of}} the slimy cap cuticle and partial veil is recommended to avoid possible gastrointestinal upset; similarly, the 1992 field guide Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America recommends the {{removal of the}} tube layer before preparation, as it can become slimy during cooking. Opinions {{about the quality of the}} mushroom vary. According to the book Boletes of North America, it is [...] "very good" [...] with a [...] "lemony" [...] flavor. A Canadian field guide is more cautious in its assessment, and suggests that one would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brave</b> to consume a mushroom with such a sticky veil. Mycologist David Arora, in his Mushrooms Demystified, opines that it is not worth eating. Whatever its palatibility to humans, the mushroom serves as a habitat for larvae of mycophagous insects such as the muscid fly Mydaea discimana and the scuttle fly Megaselia lutea.|$|E

500|$|The {{day after}} being shot, the dying Goebel {{was sworn in}} as governor. In his only act, Goebel signed a {{proclamation}} to dissolve the militia called up by Taylor, which was ignored by the militia's Republican commander. Despite the care of 18 physicians, Goebel died the afternoon of February 3, 1900. Journalists recalled his last words as [...] "Tell my friends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brave,</b> fearless, and loyal to the common people." [...] Skeptic Irvin S. Cobb uncovered another story from some in the room at the time. On having eaten his last meal, the governor supposedly remarked [...] "Doc, that was a damned bad oyster." [...] In respect of Goebel's displeasure with the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, the governor's body was transported not by the L direct line, but circuitously from his hometown of Covington north across the Ohio River to Cincinnati, and then south to Frankfort on the Queen and Crescent Railroad.|$|E
500|$|Westley {{subsequently}} {{went about}} overhauling the squad {{ahead of the}} 2012–13 season. In May 2012, Preston announced that 21 players would be leaving the club; 14 of which were released {{at the end of}} their contracts, while a further seven were transfer-listed. Preston signed 18 players during the summer transfer window, including Scott Laird, John Mousinho, Joel Byrom, and [...] Chris Beardsley, four players from Westley's former club, Stevenage. Westley stated a desire for the new group of players to be committed to his ideas [...] "My job is to develop a plan that would see the club back on an upward curve. The plan is in place. I'm looking forward to working with a group that thinks along the same lines that I do". Preston started the season well, beating Championship side Huddersfield Town 2–0 at Deepdale in the League Cup. Later on in the month, Preston went on to secure consecutive 4–1 home victories, beating Crystal Palace and Swindon Town respectively, as well as defeating Hartlepool United 5–0 a month later. However, the club went on to win just two leagues matches in a four-month period from October 2012 to February 2013. A day after Preston's 3–1 away defeat to Yeovil Town on 12 February 2013, the club released a statement announcing Westley had been sacked. With Preston sitting just five points above the relegation zone, it was revealed that [...] "the board felt that a change of manager was the only way forward". On his time at Preston, Westley stated he had to [...] "slash the wage bill by 60 percent", and as a result the [...] "re-building was well underway but the club lost confidence in me whilst I was doing it. They just want results. Short-term pain is necessary sometimes. It was necessary at Preston. And the fans got restless. I get that. Just as managers have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brave</b> enough to grit their teeth and face up to that, so owners have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brave</b> at difficult times. And they have to be able to understand the issues. I knew the answers to problems but I wasn't being allowed to solve all the problems".|$|E
500|$|Gyllenhaal is {{politically}} active. At the 18th Independent Spirit Awards, she {{spoke out against}} the Iraq war, stating {{the reason for the}} invasion was [...] "oil and imperialism". In 2005, Gyllenhaal drew controversy for her statement that the September 11 attacks were [...] "an occasion <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brave</b> enough to ask some serious questions about America's role in the world ... It is always useful as individuals or nations to ask how we may have knowingly or unknowingly contributed to this conflict." [...] Gyllenhaal took part in Artists United to Win Without War, a campaign started by Robert Greenwald that aimed to advance progressive causes and voicing opposition to the Iraq War. She and her brother Jake filmed a commercial for Rock the Vote, and visited the University of Southern California (USC) campus to encourage students to vote in the 2004 U.S. presidential election, in which she supported John Kerry. Gyllenhaal supported Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election. She has campaigned on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), an organization her family strongly supports.|$|E

500|$|These {{comments}} were extremely dangerous, as Mickl {{did not know}} all his officers or their allegiances, and many officers and men had been court-martialled and shot for similar pronouncements that revealed the speaker {{did not believe in}} [...] "ultimate victory". Mickl recognised the difficulties he faced, with [...] "volunteers" [...] who were really conscripts, and the Croats' allegiance divided between the Ustaše regime and the Partisans. As a young officer in World War I, Mickl had commanded Croatian soldiers, and knew them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brave</b> fighters. In that war, Croats had served in a multi-ethnic army under Austrian officers, and they all spoke German well enough to understand and be understood. In contrast, his new command consisted of Croatian soldiers who hardly understood German, and whose patriotism could not be assumed. Mickl saw that instilling German discipline and standards was a second order of business, and that the main role of his officers was to [...] "awaken and maintain their will to fight". Despite an understaffed headquarters, he was fortunate to have Hauptmann der Reserve Bransch as the commander of the divisional reconnaissance battalion. Bransch had served with Mickl since Africa. Mickl decided that he needed a reliable, proven officer as his divisional chief of operations, so he arranged for Bransch to be promoted to Major, and appointed him to lead his operations staff. However, a few days later, Major im Generalstab Gerd Kobe arrived fresh from the Eastern Front. Kobe had served in the operations departments at both corps and army-level, and had experience in working for brave but difficult commanders.|$|E
500|$|A love poem, [...] "The Good-Morrow" [...] is thematically {{centred on}} several concepts. The poem is {{primarily}} {{to do with}} evolving love; the movement from pure lust, in the first stanza, to a nascent and evolving spirituality which liberates the lovers because they no longer [...] "watch each other out of fear" [...] but can instead see clearly. The lovers' faith in each other allows them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brave,</b> unlike the Seven Sleepers, who were forced out of fear to hide their beliefs; with love, the lovers can allow others to pursue their own dreams, accepting that [...] "Let us possess one world; each hath one, and is one" [...] – with each other, {{there is no need}} to search further for adventure. Harold Bloom notes the intertwining of both sensual and spiritual love, arguing that Donne is suggesting that it is impossible for those buried in sensual love, [...] "busying themselves in mundane matters", to experience true love. Donne's emphasis on the importance of spiritual love can be seen from the biblical allusions; Achsah Guibbory states that the tone and wording of the poem is an intentional reference to Paul the Apostle's description of divine, agapic love; [...] "At moments like these...eros merges with agape. Walls collapse, the veil parts, we know as we are known; our deepest, truest selves exposed". Alfred W. Satterthwaite, writing in The Explicator, argues that the story of the Seven Sleepers itself contains this theme; in the story, the Sleepers awoke to find themselves [...] "thunderstruck" [...] in their new environment, something analogous to [...] "the radiant revelation love grants to the lovers in the poem".|$|E

2500|$|Aeschylus's {{popularity}} {{is evident in}} the praise the comic playwright Aristophanes gives him in The Frogs, produced some half-century after Aeschylus's death. Appearing as a character in the play, Aeschylus claims at line 1022 that his Seven against Thebes [...] "made everyone watching it to love being warlike"; with his Persians, Aeschylus claims at lines 1026–7 that he [...] "taught the Athenians to desire always to defeat their enemies."

In 1879, Oglala Lakota leaders Chief Blue Horse, Chief American Horse and Chief Red Shirt enrolled {{their children in the}} first class at Carlisle.

2500|$|In {{the climax}} of his praise of Athens, Pericles declares: [...] "In short, I say that as a city we are the school of Hellas; while I doubt if the world can produce a man, who where he has only himself to depend upon, is equal to so many emergencies, and graced by so happy a {{versatility}} as the Athenian." [...] Finally, Pericles links his praise {{of the city to}} the dead Athenians for whom he is speaking, [...] "...for the Athens that I have celebrated is only what the heroism of these and their like have made her...none of these men allowed either wealth with its prospect of future enjoyment to unnerve his spirit, or poverty with its hope of a day of freedom and riches to tempt him to shrink from danger. No, holding that vengeance upon their enemies was more to be desired than any personal blessings, and reckoning this to be the most glorious of hazards, they joyfully determined to accept the risk... Thus, choosing to die resisting, rather than to live submitting, they fled only from dishonour..." [...] The conclusion seems inevitable: [...] "Therefore, having judged that to be happy means to be free, and to be free means <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brave,</b> do not shy away from the risks of war". With the linkage of Athens' greatness complete, Pericles moves to addressing his audience.|$|E
2500|$|When casting for the film, Iliadis {{wanted to}} find actors who would not portray these {{characters}} in a stereotypical way. As Craven explains, they wanted someone who would take these characters {{in a direction that}} most actors would not—they wanted originality. Craven states, [...] "You need an actor who can bring a complete sense of commitment to that character without making it silly and not be afraid to go in there to the point where someone might say, 'Oh, you got bad in you?' You have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>brave</b> enough and mature enough to know we've all got it, and you're not afraid of putting it out there and if you've got a problem with seeing that, tough." [...] For instance, Iliadis wanted to avoid casting some superficially sexy actress in the role of Mari, because he did not want the rape sequence to appear enjoyable to the viewers in any possible way. Iliadis notes that when Sara Paxton came in her audition was [...] "good", but it was this sense of intelligence and intensity that Paxton brought with her. The actress also had the [...] "innocent face" [...] the director was looking for, someone who had this [...] "wholesomely American look" [...] that would not allow anyone to enjoy watching her go through these intense events.|$|E
