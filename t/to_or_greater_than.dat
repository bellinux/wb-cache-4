Pyrus pyrifolia revealed a lower divergence than P. persica from E. japonica as Ka and Ks between E. japonica and P. pyrifolia were much lower (Additional file 4 : Table S 4). Both Ka and Ks in IR regions were much lower than those in LSC and SSC (Table  5), which suggested that IR region evolved at a slower rate than LSC and SSC (Yi and Kim 2012). The Ka and Ks ratios of all gene groups were lower than 1, suggesting that a purifying selection might act on most E. japonica chloroplast genes.|$|R

25|$|The {{age of the}} {{universe}} is estimated to be 13.8 billion years. While it is commonly understood that nothing can accelerate to velocities equal <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> that of light, it is a common misconception that the radius of the observable universe must therefore amount to only 13.8 billion light-years. This reasoning would only make sense if the flat, static Minkowski spacetime conception under special relativity were correct. In the real universe, spacetime is curved in a way that corresponds to the expansion of space, as evidenced by Hubble's law. Distances obtained as the speed of light multiplied by a cosmological time interval have no direct physical significance.|$|E
40|$|A novel #Plasmodium falciparum$ gene, denoted cg 2 gene, {{has been}} {{recently}} discovered, and a distinct genotype, characterized by 12 point mutations and 3 size polymorphisms, {{has been shown}} to be associated with chloroquine resistance in laboratory-adapted parasite strains. One of the polymorphic regions, denoted the omega region, consists of 16 tandem repeat units in chloroquine-resistant strains, while the chloroquine-sensitive strains have either less than <b>or</b> equal <b>to</b> 15 <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> equal <b>to</b> 17 repeat units. In this study, the in vivo and in vitro responses were compared with the number of repeat units in the omega region of the cg 2 gene for 75 Cameroonian isolates determined either by DNA sequencing or agarose gel electrophoresis. The 16 -repeat units that characterise the resistant strains were found in 10 chloroquine-sensitive isolates (50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) is less than 100 nM) and 30 chloroquine-resistant isolates (IC 50 is <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> equal <b>to</b> 100 nM). Thirty-five isolates (28 chloroquine-sensitive isolates and 7 chloroquine-resistant isolates) displayed less than <b>or</b> equal <b>to</b> 15 <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> equal <b>to</b> 17 repeat units.

The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value were 81 % (83 %), 74 % (61 %), and 75 % (58 %), respectively compared with in vitro (or in vivo) responses.
