5|$|Okabe did {{not want}} to use {{traditional}} lyrics, as he felt they would clash with the design of the world in the game, and wanted to use a variety of languages to represent the open nature of the game's world.

Evans only knew English, Japanese, and French when she began the project; she listened to the other languages on YouTube to learn the rhythms and sounds of the languages and then mixed and changed them. Okabe largely allowed Evans to decide how to integrate the lyrics with the early forms of <b>the</b> <b>songs,</b> and as he usually did not know where <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> would be used in the game gave her only light direction as to the emotional tone for <b>the</b> <b>songs.</b> The composers often would modify <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> in later revisions to follow how Evans had sung for that song.|$|E
