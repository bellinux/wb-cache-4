5|$|Coonley died in 1958; ACS {{had looked}} to Coonley for her {{leadership}} {{over the years}} but even more so for her philanthropy. ACS began charging tuition in 1929, but still relied on Coonley's financial support, and her death caused serious financial hardship. Under the direction of newly appointed headmaster John Malach, a summer program was launched in 1960, open to all children from the surrounding area, to increase revenues and visibility. A swimming pool was added in 1961 to bolster the program. Enrollment had declined {{over the years and}} Malach marketed the program aggressively, personally interviewing prospective students.

5|$|Following the {{legislative}} walkouts, the assembly began passing {{most of the}} agenda and Daniels signed the bills into law.

Children in homes with an income under $41,000 could receive vouchers equal to 90% {{of the cost of}} their public school <b>tuition</b> <b>and</b> use that money to attend a private school. It provides lesser benefits to households with income over $41,000. The program will be gradually phased in over a three-year period and would be available to all state residents by 2014.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, San Diego {{officials}} {{believed that a}} normal school should be established to help the town grow and increase certification of teachers. The <b>tuition</b> <b>and</b> travel for out-of-town normal schools were large and San Diegans desired to have a closer school. San Diego had to compete with Fresno, Los Angeles, and several other cities for a school, and its first attempt to establish one in 1895 was vetoed by California governor James Budd. On March 13, 1897 Governor Budd changed course and signed legislation appropriating $50,000 {{to allow for the}} establishment of a state normal school in San Diego, to be located in University Heights. By 1905, total funds appropriated to the school totaled $333,300.|$|E

Her plan included specific tax credits {{with the purpose of}} rewarding job creation and encouraging business investment, especially in the high-tech sector.

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1910, Mao {{requested}} that his father permit him to attend the Dongshan Higher Primary School, which was located fifteen miles from Shaoshan; unlike the Shaoshan Primary School, this establishment taught modern subjects such as natural sciences. Yichang agreed to fund his son's <b>tuition</b> <b>and</b> dormitory space, and so the sixteen-year-old Mao set off to Dongshan with his older cousin, Wen Yunchang, who was also enrolled there. His two best friends at the school were Yunchang and Xiao Zizhang (also known as Xiao San), who would later join Mao in the communist movement and {{would become one of}} his first biographers. However, he was bullied for being rural and unsophisticated by many of his classmates, who were typically the sons of wealthy landlords from Xiangxiang district. He nevertheless proved to be a successful student, gaining the respect of his teachers through hard work, an ability to compose essays in the classical style, and voracious reading.

5|$|On March 11, 1994 FBI agents {{executed}} {{a search warrant}} to confiscate records from the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals {{as part of an}} ongoing investigation. Weeks later, federal agents investigating ghost payrolling subpoenaed financial records regarding several past and current employees of the Board, including Berrios and Panayotovich. The US Treasury Department investigated the IDOT contracts with Berrios and Panayotovich, and a federal grand jury subpoenaed the contracts. A federal grand jury in Chicago subpoenaed records documenting the recipients of tuition waivers to state universities request by three current and two former state legislators, including Berrios and Panayotovich. The scholarship program, begun in 1905, allowed each state legislator to waive the <b>tuition</b> <b>and</b> fees of any of the state's 12 public universities, for any two students who live within the legislator's district, without regard to academic achievement or financial need. No charges were filed against anyone in the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals. The Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals was reconstituted and renamed the Cook County Board of Review in 1998.|$|E
