5|$|The {{combined}} {{group was}} named Force F; the convoy and escorts from Britain {{as far as}} <b>the</b> <b>rendezvous,</b> became Force P; the aircraft carriers Victorious, Argus and escorts were named Force M on the voyage to the meeting point. The aircraft carrier Eagle and its escort from Gibraltar to <b>the</b> <b>rendezvous</b> became Force J and the carrier Indomitable and its escorts from Freetown were called Force K. During Operation Berserk, all the carriers and escorts became Force G; Force R {{was made up of}} the fleet refuelling vessels RFA Brown Ranger, RFA Dingledale, escorted by four corvettes and an ocean-going tug, RFA Abbeydale a Dale-class oiler; escorts were named Force W also for Operation Berserk, Force X formed the close escort to Malta, Force Z was made up of the heavy ships of Force F, that were to turn back to Gibraltar and Force Y was to conduct Operation Ascendant, a run from Malta to Gibraltar by the two ships that had reached the island during Operation Harpoon and escorts, when Pedestal entered the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|At 00:30 on 11 February the {{explosives}} were detonated {{and the western}} pier destroyed, causing the aqueduct to crumble and effectively break in half, and the Ginestra bridge was also successfully destroyed. Leaving one man who had broken his ankle when he had landed with a nearby farmer, {{the remainder of the}} Troop withdrew from the area at 01:00, splitting into three groups and heading towards the coast. The three groups moved as fast as possible towards the coast, but were all captured within a few hours of the aqueduct being demolished. The group commanded by Major Pritchard was spotted by a farmer who raised the alarm at a nearby village, leading to a local carabinieri unit surrounding the group; with little ammunition and heavily outnumbered, Pritchard decided to surrender. The other three groups, including the six sappers who had landed two miles from the objective, fared little better. The two groups from the aqueduct were soon located by Italian soldiers and ambushed, forcing them to surrender after brief firefights. The third group were found by a group of civilians as they moved towards the coast; after attempting to bluff their way past by claiming to be German soldiers on a special field exercise, which failed when the local Mayor demanded identity papers, they were captured by carabinieri. All were stripped of their weapons and equipment and transported to Naples, {{with the exception of the}} Italian translator, Picchi; he was handed over to the Blackshirts, a Fascist paramilitary group, who tortured and then executed him. Even if any of the groups had managed to make their way to the coast and <b>the</b> <b>rendezvous</b> point, they would not have been picked up by HMS Triumph. One of the two Whitleys conducting the diversionary raid at Foggia suffered engine trouble after bombing the railway yards. The pilot radioed Malta, informing his airfield that he was ditching in the mouth of the River Sele, coincidentally the area where <b>the</b> <b>rendezvous</b> was to occur. Fearing that the message had been monitored by the Italians and that the submarine might sail into a trap, the decision was made by senior officers not to send it to <b>the</b> <b>rendezvous</b> point.|$|E

The Nazi rigid airship Luxembourg appears {{overhead}} to evacuate Sinclair. FBI agents suddenly announce their presence, having secretly surrounded the area; they and the mobsters join forces to battle the Nazis. Sinclair and Lothar escape, dragging Jenny with them aboard the airship.|$|E

5|$|Departing Plymouth on 19 May, Strachan sailed for the Caribbean, passing Madeira and the Canary Islands before {{anchoring}} at Carlisle Bay, Barbados on 8 August. Five {{days later}} Strachan sail northwards {{in pursuit of}} Willaumez and on 18 August {{was caught in the}} same hurricane that dispersed Willaumez's squadron slightly to the north. During August and September, Strachan's scattered ships gathered off <b>the</b> <b>rendezvous</b> point at Chesapeake Bay in the hope of intercepting any French vessels seeking shelter in American ports. On 14 September, Belleisle, Bellona and Melampus sighted the limping French ship Impétueux off Cape Henry and drove her ashore, burning the wreck in violation of American neutrality.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{the four}} boats became separated. Bulkeley spent time {{looking for the}} other three boats, {{but was unable to}} find them in the darkness. At dawn he gave up, and headed for one of the {{alternative}} hiding places. Kelly's PT-34 was the first to reach <b>the</b> <b>rendezvous</b> point, a cove on Tagauayan Island, two hours late at 09:30. There was no sign of the other boats, and Rockwell, in the same boat with Kelly, was far from convinced that Kelly had found the correct island. Some repairs were made, and the boat was refueled by hand pumps from the drums. Two men were posted atop the island's tallest hill to watch out for the Japanese and the other boats.|$|E
5|$|Early on 23 February Willaumez sailed again, {{taking his}} fleet southwards towards the Pertuis d'Antioche near Rochefort after sending the {{schooner}} Magpye into Lorient with orders for Troude {{to follow him}} to <b>the</b> <b>rendezvous.</b> Troude found that the tide was too low to sail at once, and so sent a squadron of three frigates ahead, {{under the command of}} Commodore Pierre Roch Jurien. These frigates were the 40-gun Italienne, Calypso and Cybèle, which sailed together on the evening of 23 February southwards in the direction of Belle Île. Their departure had been observed by Beresford's force, which remained off Lorient to watch Troude but sent the 38-gun frigate HMS Amelia under Captain Frederick Paul Irby and 18-gun brig-sloop HMS Doterel under Commander Anthony Abdy in pursuit.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> player-symmetric <b>rendezvous</b> search {{problem on}} the line is considered. We {{introduce}} {{a new way to}} define mixed (randomized) strategies, and formalize a general scheme to compute <b>the</b> expected <b>rendezvous</b> time of mixed strategies. We introduce a strategy that has the following properties: (1) move patterns have di#erent lengths, and (2) the probability of choosing a move pattern in the current round depends on move pattern used in the previous round. <b>The</b> expected <b>rendezvous</b> time of our strategy is 4. 39306. We also introduce a scheme to compute lower bounds for <b>the</b> expected <b>rendezvous</b> value under a certain assumption. We use the scheme to obtain a lower bound of 3. 95460. This is the first non-trivial lower bound for the problem...|$|R

5|$|Following the crew's post-sleep activities, {{they went}} to work {{performing}} <b>the</b> <b>rendezvous</b> operations that included burning the orbiter's engines to refine the approach to the Hubble telescope. Following some delays due to communications issues, Altman and Johnson ("Ray-J") guided the orbiter within fifty feet of the telescope. McArthur successfully grappled Hubble at 17:14 UTC, and at 18:12 the telescope was safely berthed in the payload bay of Atlantis. Later in the day, Grunsfeld and Feustel (Drew), along with Good ("Bueno") and Massimino ("Mass") worked on preparing for the next day's spacewalk, gathering tools and checking out the suits and equipment {{that would be used}} during the EVA.|$|E
5|$|Kriosian {{ambassador}} Briam (Tim O'Connor) {{comes on}} board the Enterprise with some cargo, ready for a peace ceremony with the Valtian. As the ship heads to <b>the</b> <b>rendezvous,</b> they save two Ferengi from a failing ship. Despite security being assigned, the Ferengi enter the cargo bay and deactivate the stasis field on Briam's cargo, revealing a young Kriosian woman named Kamala (Famke Janssen). With the Ferengi secured, it is revealed that she is an empathic metamorph who can sense what males around her desire and react appropriately. She was being brought as an arranged marriage to the Valtian representative. Kamala is generating pheromones that can affect males around her, which was why she was kept in stasis until the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|ML254 {{then began}} slowly {{to leave the}} harbour mouth, {{carrying}} 38survivors of Vindictives 55crewmen huddled on deck, where they remained exposed to machine gun fire from the shore. As Drummond turned his boat seawards and proceeded back to the offshore squadron that was still engaged in an artillery duel with the German defenders, one of the missing launches, ML276 passed her, having {{caught up with the}} lost cruiser at this late stage. Drummond called to ML276s commander—Lieutenant Rowley Bourke—that he believed there were still men in the water and Bourke immediately entered the harbour to search for them. Drummond's launch proceeded to <b>the</b> <b>rendezvous</b> with the destroyer , overweighted and sinking, so severe was the damage she had suffered.|$|E

5|$|On 14 September, Spee {{decided to}} use his two armored cruisers to raid the British base at Apia; he sent Nürnberg to escort the squadron's colliers to <b>the</b> <b>rendezvous</b> location. At the Battle of Papeete on 22 September, Nürnberg {{and the rest of}} the East Asia Squadron bombarded the colony. During the bombardment, the French gunboat Zélée was sunk by gunfire from the German ships. Fear of mines in the harbor {{prevented}} von Spee from seizing the coal that lay in the harbor. By 12 October, the squadron had reached Easter Island. There they were joined by Dresden and Leipzig, which had sailed from American waters. After a week in the area, the ships departed for Chile.|$|E
5|$|On May 24, 1972, US President Richard M. Nixon and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin {{signed an}} {{agreement}} calling for a joint manned space mission, and declaring intent for all future international manned spacecraft {{to be capable of}} docking with each other. This authorized the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), involving <b>the</b> <b>rendezvous</b> and docking in Earth orbit of a surplus Apollo Command/Service Module with a Soyuz spacecraft. The mission took place in July 1975. This was the last US manned space flight until the first orbital flight of the Space Shuttle in April 1981.|$|E
5|$|Only 160 {{men out of}} the 600 {{members of}} the 9th Battalion tasked with {{eliminating}} the enemy battery at Merville arrived at <b>the</b> <b>rendezvous</b> point. Lieutenant Colonel Terence Otway, {{in charge of the}} operation, decided to proceed regardless, as the emplacement had to be destroyed by 06:00 to prevent it firing on the invasion fleet and the troops arriving on Sword Beach. In the Battle of Merville Gun Battery, Allied forces disabled the guns with plastic explosives at a cost of 75 casualties. The emplacement was found to contain 75mm guns rather than the expected 150mm heavy coastal artillery. Otway's remaining force withdrew with the assistance of a few members of the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Les Sables-d'Olonne {{was a minor}} naval battle {{fought on}} 23 February 1809 off the town of Les Sables-d'Olonne on the Biscay Coast of France between a French Navy {{squadron}} of three frigates and a larger British squadron of ships of the line. The French squadron had sailed from the port of Lorient on 23 February {{in an effort to}} link up with a fleet from Brest under Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, but missed <b>the</b> <b>rendezvous</b> and was pursued by a British blockade squadron under Rear-Admiral Robert Stopford. The French commander, Commodore Pierre Roch Jurien, anchored his squadron under the batteries which protected the town of Les Sables-d'Olonne in the hope of dissuading an attack.|$|E
5|$|Three of {{the small}} vessels managed to return to England: MLs 160, 307 and 443. They had reached <b>the</b> <b>rendezvous</b> and waited until 10:00 for the destroyers to appear. Having already been {{attacked}} once, they moved further out into the Atlantic to try and avoid the German Air Force, but a Junkers 88 appeared overhead at 07:30 and approached them at low level for a closer look. The ships opened fire and hit the Junkers in the cockpit. The plane went into the sea. The next aircraft to appear was a Blohm & Voss seaplane which attempted to bomb the ships, but left after being damaged by machine-gun fire. The surviving MLs eventually reached England unaided the following day.|$|E
5|$|After {{exceeding}} the original departure time limit by a half-hour, Bockscar, accompanied by The Great Artiste, proceeded to Kokura, thirty minutes away. The delay at <b>the</b> <b>rendezvous</b> {{had resulted in}} clouds and drifting smoke over Kokura from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby Yahata the previous day. Additionally, the Yawata Steel Works intentionally burned coal tar, to produce black smoke. The clouds and smoke resulted in 70% of the area over Kokura being covered, obscuring the aiming point. Three bomb runs were made over the next 50 minutes, burning fuel and exposing the aircraft repeatedly to the heavy defenses of Yawata, but the bombardier was unable to drop visually. By {{the time of the}} third bomb run, Japanese antiaircraft fire was getting close, and Second Lieutenant Jacob Beser, who was monitoring Japanese communications, reported activity on the Japanese fighter direction radio bands.|$|E

5|$|Defeated at Lae, the Japanese {{pulled back}} to Finschhafen, which the Americans and Australians chose {{as the site}} of their next offensive. On 21 September an assault force under Barbey left Buna, escorted by US destroyers {{including}} Mahan, and stopped at Lae to pick up an Australian infantry brigade. Additional US destroyers were attached to the force, preceding the convoy to <b>the</b> <b>rendezvous</b> point. On 22 September, before daylight, the amphibious force stormed the beach at Finschhafen; by noon, all troops were ashore. As the destroyers began to withdraw from the area, ten Japanese torpedo planes winged across the water, targeting Mahan and five other US destroyers. The ships returned fire, shooting down eight of the ten planes; the remaining two escaped. This scrimmage ended without any hits by enemy planes. By 2 October, Finschhafen was {{in the hands of the}} Allies.|$|E
5|$|During December 1796 {{and early}} January 1797, the French army {{repeatedly}} attempted {{to land in}} Ireland. Early in the voyage, the frigate Fraternité carrying de Galles and Hoche, was separated from the fleet and missed <b>the</b> <b>rendezvous</b> at Mizen Head. Admiral Bouvet and General Grouchy decided to attempt the landing at Bantry Bay without their commanders, but severe weather made any landing impossible. For {{more than a week}} the fleet waited for a break in the storm, until Bouvet abandoned the invasion on 29December and, after a brief and unsuccessful effort to land {{at the mouth of the}} River Shannon, ordered his scattered ships to return to Brest. During the operation and subsequent retreat a further 11ships were wrecked or captured, with the loss of thousands of soldiers and sailors.|$|E
5|$|In November 1941 the LRDG, {{now under}} {{command of the}} newly formed Eighth Army, moved from Kufra to Siwa (central Libya). The patrols were given the task of {{watching}} the desert tracks south of Jebel Akhdar and report any signs of reinforcements and withdrawals. 'R1' Patrol was to pick up Captain David Stirling and 30 men who had parachuted behind the lines to raid airfields {{to the west of}} Tobruk. Only 21 men arrived at <b>the</b> <b>rendezvous</b> and were returned to the British lines, later becoming the nucleus of the Special Air Service (SAS). One of the other roles assigned to the LRDG was to transport SAS units behind enemy lines; this continued until the SAS were issued with their own transport in 1942. In early November 'T2' Patrol took four British officers to the Gebel and was to return and collect them three weeks later. The officers were the advance land party of Operation Flipper, which had planned to kill General Rommel.|$|E
