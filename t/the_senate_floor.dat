5|$|After his censure, McCarthy {{continued}} senatorial duties {{for another}} {{two and a half}} years, but his career as a major public figure had been unmistakably ruined. His colleagues in the Senate avoided him; his speeches on <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor</b> were delivered to a near-empty chamber or were received with conspicuous displays of inattention.|$|E
5|$|On March 1, 1951 – exactly 38 {{years from}} his first day in Congress – Barkley's fellow congressmen {{presented}} him with the Congressional Gold Medal {{in honor of his}} legislative service.

5|$|In February, Rivers {{submitted}} {{a bill to}} provide more funding for food banks and other charitable causes. The bill authorized public utilities to solicit and collect donations from customers to be put towards food programs for the poor. It also made the donations received by utilities separate from gross income, allowing {{for it to be}} tax-free. The bill passed in the State House in Feb. 2011 but failed to make it to <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1850s, the antislavery Republican Party became the {{dominant}} political organization in Massachusetts, led by Senators Charles Sumner and Henry Wilson who espoused Garrison's views in Congress and further increased sectionalism. In 1856, Sumner delivered {{a speech on}} <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor</b> so scathing and insulting to pro-slavery politicians that Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina severely beat him with a cane. By 1860, the Republicans controlled the Governor's office, the state legislature and the mayoralty of Boston.|$|E

5|$|After the {{purchase}} was approved, Jefferson drafted {{a system of}} governing the newly acquired territory. Fearing that the Federalists would oppose any system he had devised, he delivered his draft to Breckinridge {{and asked him to}} introduce it in the Senate as his own. To maintain the ruse, Breckinridge moved that a committee be formed to recommend a plan for governing Louisiana Territory. Working through the committee, he brought Jefferson's plan to <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor</b> with its essentials intact. Because the plan provided for the taxation of Louisiana residents without giving them representation in Congress, Federalists and some Democratic-Republicans opposed it. Nevertheless, it passed by a vote of 26–6.|$|E
5|$|An ally of Senator Richard Mentor Johnson, who was {{a primary}} voice against the {{practice}} of debt imprisonment, Rowan made a notable speech denouncing the practice on <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor</b> in 1828. A consistent opponent of internal improvements and tariffs, even those that would benefit his own constituents, he voted against a measure allocating federal funds {{for the construction of}} a road connecting the cities of Lexington and Maysville. The vote was ill-received by the people of the state, and Rowan's popularity took a significant hit. When the bill was re-introduced in the next congressional session, Rowan voted for it only after receiving significant pressure from the state legislature to do so. The bill passed in this session, but newly elected president Andrew Jackson vetoed it.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{retired from}} the {{practice}} of law in 1989. In June 1990, Cooper was honored with a gala screening of Gentleman From Kentucky, a Kentucky Educational Television documentary about his life, at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. On February 21, 1991, Cooper died of heart failure in a retirement home in Washington. He had been preceded in death by his second wife, Lorraine, on February 3, 1985. On February 26, 1991, Kentucky's two senators, Wendell H. Ford and Mitch McConnell, gave speeches on <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor</b> praising Cooper, and the Senate adjourned in Cooper's memory. Cooper was buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.|$|E

5|$|Harding {{had spoken}} out against lynching in his April 1921 speech before Congress and {{supported}} Congressman Leonidas Dyer's federal anti-lynching bill, which passed the House of Representatives in January 1922. When it reached <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor</b> in November 1922, it was filibustered by Southern Democrats, and Lodge withdrew it {{so as to}} allow the ship subsidy bill Harding favored to be debated (it was likewise filibustered). Blacks blamed Harding for the Dyer bill's defeat; Harding biographer Robert K. Murray noted that it was hastened to its end by Harding's desire to have the ship subsidy bill considered.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Tillman accused {{his junior}} {{colleague}} from South Carolina, John L. McLaurin, {{of corruption in}} a speech to the Senate. McLaurin, who had been a Tillmanite before breaking from him after being elected to the Senate, called him a liar, whereupon Tillman rushed across <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor</b> and punched McLaurin in the face. McLaurin reciprocated, giving Tillman a bloody nose before the Sergeant at Arms and senators intervened. The body immediately went into closed session, and held both men in contempt. The Senate considered suspending them, but Tillman argued that it was unfair to deprive South Carolina of her representation, though the body could certainly expel the two men—knowing he had enough Democratic votes to prevent it. In the end, both men were censured, and later that year, Tillman arranged for McLaurin, whose term ended in 1903, to not be re-elected.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{taking his}} seat in the Senate, Crittenden {{was named to the}} Committee on Public Lands and the Committee on the Judiciary, {{probably}} due to Clay's influence. Early in his term, Crittenden vociferously opposed Senator Thomas H. Benton's proposal to spend the federal budget surplus on public land graduation and military fortifications along the eastern seaboard. He also blasted the Jackson administration for issuing the Specie Circular, requiring that all payment for government land be made in gold or silver. He pointed out that the principles of the circular had been presented in a resolution on <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor,</b> but had been tabled by a large majority. Crittenden maintained that the tabling of the resolution was a condemnation by the Senate, yet the administration issued the circular only months later, overstepping, as Crittenden saw it, the bounds of the executive branch's authority. Crittenden debated the issue at length with Senator Benton, and Congress ultimately passed a bill requiring the government to accept the notes of specie-paying banks for the purchase of government lands, but President Jackson employed his pocket veto to prevent it from becoming law.|$|E

5|$|In January 1827, the General Assembly {{considered}} {{whether to}} elect U.S. Senator John Randolph {{for a full}} six-year term. Randolph was a contentious figure; although he shared the staunch states' rights views held {{by most of the}} Virginia legislature, he had a reputation for fiery rhetoric and erratic behavior on <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor,</b> which put his allies in an awkward position. Furthermore, he had made enemies by fiercely opposing President John Quincy Adams and Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. The nationalists of the Democratic-Republican Party, who supported Adams and Clay, were a sizable minority in the Virginia legislature. They hoped to unseat Randolph by capturing the vote of states' rights supporters who were uncomfortable with the senator's reputation. They approached Tyler, and promised their endorsement if he sought the seat. Tyler repeatedly declined the offer, endorsing Randolph as the best candidate, but the political pressure continued to mount. Eventually he agreed to accept the seat if chosen. On the day of the vote, one assemblyman argued there was no political difference between the two candidates—Tyler was merely more agreeable than Randolph. The incumbent's supporters, though, contended that Tyler's election would be a tacit endorsement of the Adams administration. The legislature selected Tyler in a vote of 115–110, and he resigned his governorship on March 4, 1827, as his Senate term began.|$|E
