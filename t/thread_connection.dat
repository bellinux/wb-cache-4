The invalidation of screw <b>thread</b> <b>connection</b> will lead to mechanical failure or even retirement. Vibration tapping is essentially a kind of high-energy impact cutting which increases the rigidity of the tool.

Theoretical study and experimental results show that vibration tapping improves the metal cutting rates, enhances the machining accuracy and makes screw <b>thread</b> <b>connection</b> assembly easier. At the same time, vibration tapping process does not reduce the strength of screw thread. As the screw thread can be more uniformed cut at different depths, vibration tapping enhances the strength of screw thread slightly...|$|E

40|$|<b>Threaded</b> <b>connections</b> are {{responsible}} assemblies, defining sucker rod string reliability. Despite {{the variety of}} their design, industrial materials analysis shows that breakages occur in rod body and <b>threaded</b> <b>connections.</b> In the process of lowering and lifting operations, aimed at well pump replacement, screwing and unscrewing of sucker rods threaded joints is repeated, so pin threads and couplings are worn. After analyzing the method of pin threads wear determining while screwing, unscrewing, connection and breakout sucker rods tightening, proposed by S. A. Babayan, {{it has been found}} out that the amount of thread wear during the makeup is 20 30 times greater than thread wear while fastening. According to this method the last three threads are practically unworn and deterioration of the first coil is 10 - 12 times greater than the wear of the last turns. The results of calculation correspond with the wear data in the course of sucker rods operation in an industrial environment. To identify and compare the distribution of stresses in the sucker rods <b>threaded</b> <b>connections</b> using the developed computer ANSYS, finite element axisymmetric models of new and worn standard <b>threaded</b> <b>connections</b> with a diameter of 19 mm have been created.

With further deterioration, thread tensions are rising in the middle turns, and in extreme turns - are reduced, so the impact of further deterioration on the connection durability is negative. Also it have been found that at the limit thread wear maximum stresses are concentrated in the thread coupling, resulting in the fracture of its body...|$|R
