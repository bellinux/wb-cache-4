25|$|With the war's ever {{increasing}} need for able bodied men consuming America's labor {{force in the}} early 1940s, industry turned to teen-aged boys and girls to fill in as replacements. Consequently, many states had to change their child-labor laws to allow these teenagers to work. The lures of patriotism, adulthood, and money led many youth <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> and take a defense job. Between 1940 and 1944, the number of teenage workers increased by 1.9 million, {{and the number of}} students in public high schools dropped from 6.6 million in 1940 to 5.6 million in 1944, as a million students—and many teachers—took jobs.|$|E
25|$|George Leslie Norris {{was born}} in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales. His parents were George and Mary Jane Norris. Leslie had two younger brothers, Eric and Gordon.

That same year, Norris had <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> due to financial pressures. He began working as a rates clerk in the Town Hall in Merthyr.|$|E
25|$|Knorr also {{believed}} that her fourth husband, Chet Harris, had turned Suesan into a witch, so Suesan received the worst of Knorr's abuse. After one severe beating, Suesan ran away from home.

Knorr denied the abuse claims and told the hospital staff that Suesan had mental issues. Authorities did not investigate the matter further and released Suesan back into her mother's custody. Knorr punished Suesan for running away by beating her while wearing a pair of leather gloves. She also forced her other children to take turns beating their sister. In the subsequent weeks, Knorr handcuffed Suesan to her bed and ordered her other children to stand watch over her. Knorr refused to let Suesan leave the house and forced her <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>school.</b> Knorr also pulled her other children out of school, and most of them never advanced past the eighth grade.|$|E

25|$|When Lillian was {{pregnant}} with Desmond, an Adventist book salesman shared insights on nutrition with the family, sparking {{a chain of events}} affecting Desmond's life. At a Adventist camp meeting in 1939 Desmond was given a Bible, which he would complete 3 years later, around the time he finished primary school. However his parents divorced when he was nine; Wilfred moved to Canberra, and Lillian and the boys later moved to Sydney, New South Wales (NSW). He passed his Intermediate Certificate in 1943. However, due to the family's poverty and Australia's involvement in World War II, Desmond had <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>school.</b> He became officially employed with Associated Newspapers at the age of 15, although he had started working there months earlier, and was promoted from copy boy to an editorial position, because of his published work. Meanwhile, Desmond took night classes for high school. All along, Desmond was being influenced by encounters with Adventists and other Christians, and steadily collected books on Christian theology, and the creation-evolution controversy.|$|E
25|$|Other {{factors that}} explain the {{relative}} underrepresentation of Bedouin {{women in the}} labor force were discrimination in the labor market, inferior quality of education in Bedouin towns, and a lack of suitable jobs nearby. While all of these factors could also apply to explaining the lack of Bedouin men {{in the labor force}}, they are especially acute for women. Discrimination in the labor market affects Bedouin men as well as women. However, Bedouin women must also contend with the cultural expectation that women should not work outside of the home. While a lack of education is problematic for employment in general (male as well as female), education is a bigger obstacle to entry into the labor market for women than it is for men. Bedouin girls are much more likely <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> than their male peers, and women are less likely to seek higher education. Finally, Bedouin women are often not permitted to travel alone. Therefore, travelling long distances to work is not an option.This effectively limits women's employment possibilities to those in the immediate geographic vicinity. When women are employed, they generally earn much less than men.|$|E

This would cause later confusion about Rogan's age, as some records (along with his Hall of Fame plaque) give his birth year as 1889, others as 1893; recent histories, such as Phil Dixon's, conclude that the latter date is correct.|$|E

500|$|In the {{interest}} of the family, rural females are sent to find urban employment over male counterparts, mainly to supplement familial income at home and to support the males, who are more likely to attend college. The male standard of education in China is higher, particularly when a family is under financial stress, females are more likely <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> to generate income for the family. Because females have lesser impact on the family's long-term financial stability, their rights for opportunities development are consequently unequal. This inequality also reinforces emotional motivations for migration. Many women migrate to find personal fulfillment. Stereotypes in China that developed as a result of globalization portray rural women as [...] "‘backward’" [...] and urban women as [...] "‘modern’". Many people associate modernity with maturity, so rural women migrate to cities to be perceived as mature. Migrant women also appreciate the knowledge they obtain (including political- and self-awareness) while living in cities. Some women even report desiring to leave villages as a result of boredom with rural life. Ideas perpetuated due to globalization simultaneously increased women's intentions to become independent; many migrant workers desire lives separate from those of their families’.|$|E
