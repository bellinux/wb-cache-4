He sent dispatches to Scotland {{ordering}} that all runaways from the Covenanter regiments which broke at Marston Moor be returned, {{but not before}} every tenth deserter was hanged according to article 14 of Leven's Articles of War. Once reunited with the Army of both Kingdoms, {{the remnants of the}} six broken regiments were put to base service such as latrine duties and the disposing of corpses until <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> chance to redeem themselves during the storm of Newcastle.

Hermione strikes Harry with a curse to {{disguise}} his features as the Snatchers take them all to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix Lestrange imprisons Harry and Ron in the cellar with Luna, Ollivander, and Griphook the goblin. Bellatrix then tortures Hermione for information on how <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> sword of Gryffindor, which Bellatrix claims was in her vault at Gringott's. Harry requests help, communicating {{with a piece of}} broken mirror in his possession. Dobby apparates into the cellar to save them. Harry and Ron rush to save Hermione, and a battle ensues that sees Harry disarm Draco Malfoy. Dobby drops a chandelier above Bellatrix, forcing her to release Hermione. Bellatrix throws her knife at them as Dobby grabs everyone and disapparates. They arrive at Shell Cottage and find that Bellatrix's knife has fatally wounded Dobby. Harry insists that they bury Dobby properly without any magic, which they all agree to do.|$|E
5|$|Nawabs of Murshidabad succeeded the Nawabs of Bengal as Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad, {{following}} Mansur Ali Khan's abdication <b>They</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> title {{changed as}} the title of the Nawab of Bengal was abolished in 1880. They had little or no say in the share of the revenue collected and were ceased to use any force. After Indian Independence in 1947 it was declared that the princely states must accede to either India or Pakistan (East/West Pakistan). Murshidabad (the capital city) became a part of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) for two days, as it had a Muslim majority. It became a part of India on 17 August 1947, following which the Pakistani flag was brought down from the Hazarduari Palace and the Indian tricolour was hoisted atop it. After merging with India, they had no power as the Government of India took over all the princely states in India. The house of the Nawabs appeared to have come to end in 1969 with Waris Ali Mirza being the last reigning Nawab and with no clear succession. Although he left three sons and three daughters there was no clear successor to the title after his death because he disinherited one and the others disputed his will.|$|E
5|$|The 1985–86 {{season was}} one of Al-Talaba and Saeed's best season in their history where Al-Talaba {{achieved}} their third league title after beating their rivals at the time, Al-Rasheed, in front of 50,000 spectators, with Saeed's only goal from a penalty, finishing in 1st with 25 points from 15 matches. Saeed finished the season as the top goalscorer of the league along with Al-Zawra'a's Ahmed Radhi and Al-Jaish's Rahim Hameed where, for the first time, {{every one of them}} scored 9 goals in the league. As of that season, Saeed was also made the club's vice president. In the 1986 Saddam International Tournament, Saeed played for Baghdad XI, rather than Al-Talaba, because Baghdad XI was essentially the Iraq national team under a different name. Baghdad XI won all of their group matches including a victory over Saeed's club Al-Talaba to qualify for the semi-finals where they thrashed Al-Zawra'a to reach the final. However, Baghdad XI lost the final 2–1 to Al-Rasheed; Saeed scored Baghdad XI's only goal in the final in the 78th minute with a penalty. Saeed returned to Al-Talaba for the 1986 Al-Muthabara Cup between Al-Talaba and Al-Rasheed; Al-Rasheed won the match 2–1. In the 1986–87 season, Al-Talaba finished mid-table in 6th place at 49 points. The {{second half of the season}} witnessed the retirement of the team captain, Jamal Ali, in 1987, when Saeed was named the new captain of the team, although he only participated in the first stage of the league due to an association punishment against him. The 1987–88 season was the only season where Saeed hasn't scored any goals due to him not participating in many matches because of national duty. They finished, for the first time since 1977–78, in 8th place at 30 points. Saeed wasted Al-Talaba's hope in achieving the league title in 1988–89 when he missed his penalty in the final of the league against their rivals, Al-Rasheed, after a 1–1 draw. The score was 4–3 to Al-Talaba but with Saeed's miss <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> equalizer and with his teammate missing the fifth penalty, Al-Rasheed won 5–4. Saeed returned to the top three goalscorers of the league table in 3rd with 12 goals along with Al-Zawra'a's Saad Abdul-Raheem.|$|E

25|$|In {{light of}} the BBFC and ESRB decisions, Rockstar decided to censor the game. Censoring took five main forms. The primary {{alteration}} was {{the addition of a}} blurring effect over executions; during an execution the screen turns red, and flashes black and white. The second alteration was the removal of all but two decapitations. Initially, several weapons in the game could decapitate enemies, but with the exception of two plot-important decapitations, all such executions were removed. Thirdly, the pliers executions were changed. Originally, a gruesome execution with a pliers involved ripping off the enemy's testicles, whilst a level 2 execution involved tearing open his throat. In the edited version, the pliers is used to beat the enemy over the head. The fourth change was the removal of innocent characters from certain levels. Originally, the game was structured {{in such a way that}} the player had the choice as to whether or not to kill these characters. If they didn't, <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> ending where Daniel defeats Leo, if they did, <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> alternate ending. The final change involved the rating system. Originally, the game had a rating system similar to the first game, whereby the player was rated based on speed and severity of execution types. To achieve a maximum rating, one had to perform a set number of gruesome executions in each level. This rating system was completely removed from the edited version.|$|E
25|$|Such a big army {{needed a}} lot of money. Churaman decided to gather booty from rich states of Kota and Bundi.

This shows the calculating brains of Churaman where he managed to make the enemy flee {{without having to go}} in for any bloodshed. In 1705 there was a war with Mughal subadar Mukhtar khan of Agra and with Raja Bahadur in 1707 at Sinsini. In the second war at Sinsini 1000 Jats were lost but <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> victory.|$|E

Conversely, however, two Northamptonshire batsmen batting at 4 and 5 perished for ducks to Richard Johnson. Somerset replied well, though, with 53 from opener Matthew Wood, but rash strokes gave wickets around everywhere as Somerset made 356 – admittedly only 52 behind. Off-spinner Jason Brown got six wickets for 112, just as many as he had taken before this game, while Ian Blackwell played a typical 59 off 77 balls.|$|E
25|$|Hyde Park {{received}} its name before the Revolution, but had few residents {{until just before}} it.

They built a union church, for all denominations, with the understanding that the first one within it that built a congregation large enough to support its own building could have the union church. Three years later, in 1792, the Classis of Kingston recognized the Dutch Reformed Church in Hyde Park as a separate congregation, and <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> church.
