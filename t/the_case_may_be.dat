5|$|Rojhaz, {{looking more}} like the Captain America of old (or of the future, as <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>may</b> <b>be),</b> refuses to go back through the rift: he hopes {{to build a better}} America from the beginning. Fury tricks Rojhaz by playing on the trust that Captain America had for the Nick Fury of his own time, knocks him {{unconscious}} and carries the body back through the rift, thus going into the future himself.|$|E
5|$|These speculations {{cannot be}} proven without doubt {{but as a}} governor, Odaenathus {{would have been the}} highest {{authority}} in the province and above any legionary commander and provincial officials; this would make him the commander of the Roman forces in the province. Whatever <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>may</b> <b>be,</b> starting from 258, Odaenathus strengthened his position and extended his political influence in the region. By 260, Odaenathus held the rank, credibility and power to pacify the Roman east following the Battle of Edessa.|$|E

5|$|If {{an offense}} is filed, the issue may be {{investigated}} by police on duty. Permission for {{search and seizure}} is issued by the police prosecutor on duty at the police district. Apprehended people are permitted a free defense counsel at the public's expense. If the police wish to keep apprehended people in detention, the issue is brought to the relevant district court, a process which may be repeated several times if the custody needs to be extended. Investigations are led by a police prosecutor. During investigation, <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> concluded as a non-criminal offense, dismissed, or transferred to another police district. Minor cases with a positive finding may be resolved by police penalty notice, settlement by a conflict resolution board and withdrawal of prosecution.|$|E
5|$|An error as to a {{precedent}} fact, if committed, deprives the public authority {{of power to}} take the action or make the decision in question. The existence or non-existence of the fact, as <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>may</b> <b>be,</b> is a condition precedent or prerequisite to the exercise of the power. An example of an error of this nature {{can be found in}} the United Kingdom case White & Collins v. Minister of Health (1939). In that case, under the relevant statute, the authority could only issue a compulsory purchase order affecting the applicants' land if it was not part of, among other things, a park. A minister confirmed the purchase order but the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that it should be quashed, finding that the minister could not exercise power to acquire the land since it was part of a park. Whether the land was or was not a park was {{a precedent}} fact, and the minister had committed an error concerning this fact.|$|E

These new forms of land occupancy signalled, when the ensuing transactions were made, an approach of economic opportunism rather than geographic logic.
