50|$|<b>Terahertz</b> <b>radiation</b> {{falls in}} between {{infrared}} radiation and microwave radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum, and it shares some properties {{with each of}} these. Like infrared and microwave radiation, <b>terahertz</b> <b>radiation</b> travels {{in a line of}} sight and is non-ionizing. Like microwave radiation, <b>terahertz</b> <b>radiation</b> can penetrate a wide variety of non-conducting materials. <b>Terahertz</b> <b>radiation</b> can pass through clothing, paper, cardboard, wood, masonry, plastic and ceramics. The penetration depth is typically less than that of microwave radiation. <b>Terahertz</b> <b>radiation</b> has limited penetration through fog and clouds and cannot penetrate liquid water or metal. THz is not ionizing yet can penetrate some distance through body tissue, so it is of interest as a replacement for medical X-rays. Due to its longer wavelength, images made using THz have lower resolution than X-rays and need to be enhanced (see figure at right).|$|E
50|$|Unlike X-rays, <b>terahertz</b> <b>radiation</b> is not {{ionizing}} radiation and its low photon energies in general do not damage tissues and DNA. Some frequencies of <b>terahertz</b> <b>radiation</b> can penetrate several millimeters of tissue with low water content (e.g., fatty tissue) and reflect back. <b>Terahertz</b> <b>radiation</b> can also detect differences in water content and density of a tissue. Such methods could allow effective detection of epithelial cancer with an imaging {{system that is}} safe, non-invasive, and painless.|$|E

40|$|A {{terahertz}} {{system uses}} dielectric lens antennas for focusing and collimating beams of <b>terahertz</b> wave <b>radiation.</b> Linearly polarized <b>terahertz</b> wave <b>radiation</b> {{has been widely}} applied in the terahertz system. Therefore, an accurate method for analyzing the power flow density in the dielectric lens antenna irradiated with the linearly polarized <b>terahertz</b> wave <b>radiation</b> is important to design the terahertz systems. In optics, ray-tracing method {{has been used to}} calculate the power flow density by a number density of rays. In this study, we propose a method of ray-tracing combined with Fresnelâ€™s transmission, including transmittance and polarization of the <b>terahertz</b> wave <b>radiation</b> to calculate power flow density in a Silicon lens antenna. We compare power flow density calculated by the proposed method with the regular ray-tracing method. When the Silicon lens antenna is irradiated with linearly polarized <b>terahertz</b> wave <b>radiation,</b> the proposed method calculates the power flow density more accurately than the regular ray-tracing...|$|R
40|$|The {{terahertz}} gap has {{a frequency}} ranges from ~ 0. 3 THz to ~ 10 THz in {{the electromagnetic spectrum}} which is in between microwave and infrared. The <b>terahertz</b> <b>radiations</b> are invisible to naked eye. In comparison with x-ray they are intrinsically safe, non-destructive and non-invasive. Terahertz spectroscopy enables 3 D imaging of structures and materials, and the measurement of the unique spectral fingerprints of chemical and physical forms. <b>Terahertz</b> <b>radiations</b> are produced by a dendrimer based high power terahertz source and spectroscopy technologies.

In the pharmaceutical industries it enables nondestructive, internal, chemical analysis of tablets, capsules, and other dosage forms. Tablet coatings are a major factor in drug bioavailability.

50|$|The earth's {{atmosphere}} {{is a strong}} absorber of <b>terahertz</b> <b>radiation,</b> so the range of <b>terahertz</b> <b>radiation</b> in air is limited to tens of meters, making it unsuitable for long-distance communications. However, at distances of ~10 meters the band may still allow many useful applications in imaging and construction of high bandwidth wireless networking systems, especially indoor systems. In addition, producing and detecting coherent <b>terahertz</b> <b>radiation</b> remains technically challenging, though inexpensive commercial sources now exist in the 0.3-1.0 THz range (the {{lower part of the}} spectrum), including gyrotrons, backward wave oscillators, and resonant-tunneling diodes.|$|E

For the electrons with high enough mobility, the plasma waves can propagate in field effect transistors (FETs) channel leading to resonant Terahertz (THz) emission or detection.

40|$|Based on {{computer}} simulations and theoretical analysis, a new dynamic state {{is found in}} inductively coupled intrinsic Josephson junctions {{in the absence of}} an external magnetic field. In this state, the plasma oscillation is uniform along the c axis and there are (2 m+ 1) Ï€ phase kinks, with m being an integer, periodic and thus non-uniform in the c direction. In the IV characteristics, the state manifests itself as current steps occurring at all cavity modes. Inside the current steps, the plasma oscillation becomes strong, which generates several harmonics in frequency spectra at a given voltage. The recent experiments on <b>terahertz</b> <b>radiations</b> from the mesa of a BSCCO single crystal can be explained in terms of this state. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figures; to appear in Phys. Rev.

40|$|Behaviour of hot {{electrons}} {{under the}} influence of dc field in carbon nanotubes is theoretically considered. The study was done semi-classically by solving Boltzmann transport equation with the presence of the hot electrons source to derive the current densities. Plots of the normalized axial current density versus electric field strength of the chiral CNTs reveal a negative differential conductivity (NDC). Unlike achiral CNTs, the NDC occurs at a low field about 6 kV/cm for chiral CNT. We further observed that the switch from NDC to PDC occurs at lower dc field in chiral CNTs than achiral counterparts. Hence the suppression of the unwanted domain instability usually associated with NDC and a potential generation of <b>terahertz</b> <b>radiations</b> occurs at low electric field for chiral CNTs.

By cooling the crystal to reduce losses caused by phonon absorptions, the generated THz bandwidth was as narrow as 23 GHz at the center frequency of 0. 63 THz. The measurement result of temperature-dependent showed gradual intensity increase of the generated terahertz pulse and red shift of the center frequency as the temperature decrease from 291 to 143 K, but insignificant reduction of the spectral bandwidth. Furthermore, the stoichiometric crystal was very suitable for the suppression of THz loss at low temperature compared to the congruent LiNbO 3 crystal...|$|R
