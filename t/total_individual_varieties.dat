500|$|As a {{language}} label, the term [...] "Nahuatl" [...] encompasses {{a group of}} closely related languages or divergent dialects within the Nahuan branch of the Uto-Aztecan language family. The Mexican Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas (National Institute of Indigenous Languages) recognize 30 different <b>individual</b> <b>varieties</b> within the [...] "language group" [...] labeled Nahuatl. The Ethnologue recognizes 28 varieties with separate ISO codes. Sometimes the label also is used to include the Pipil language (Nawat) of El Salvador. Regardless of whether the Nahuatl is considered to label a dialect continuum {{or a group of}} separate languages, the varieties form a single branch within the Uto-Aztecan family, descended from a single Proto-Nahuan language. Within Mexico the question of whether to consider <b>individual</b> <b>varieties</b> to be languages or dialects of a single language is highly political. This article focuses on describing the general history of the group and on giving an overview of the diversity it encompasses.

40|$|Expertise is {{regarded}} as the most important asset for groups working on knowledge-intensive tasks. This dissertation advances a multi-dimensional conception of group expertise that includes depth, breadth and variety as three distinct dimensions, and develops a model of the joint effect of the three dimensions on knowledge sharing and group performance. Two empirical studies test different components of the model. Using data on 174 groups from a Fortune 500 telecommunications company, one study supports the hypothesis that depth of group expertise will have a less positive effect on group performance as breadth of group expertise increases, particularly when groups engage in a low level of external task process. Using data on knowledge sharing networks among 44 employees of a supply chain service organization, the second study probes into dyadic interactions underlying group process, and tests how <b>individual</b> <b>variety</b> of experience, functional department experience (proxy for depth of expertise at the individual level), and dyadic functional difference (proxy for breadth of expertise at the dyadic level) affect dyadic knowledge sharing. Results show that <b>individual</b> <b>variety</b> of experience improves ease of knowledge sharing, and that the negative effect of functional department experience on ease of knowledge sharing is mitigated by <b>individual</b> <b>variety</b> of experience. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are considered, and directions for future studies are discussed. Dissertatio...|$|R

To determine the optimum number of <b>individuals</b> per <b>variety</b> to be genotyped to capture the total diversity, {{the number of individuals}} analyzed were increased one by one until the number of alleles reached to a maximum with no further increase for a given locus. Accordingly, we determined that 10 <b>individuals</b> per <b>variety</b> was sufficient to capture the total genetic variation in a given variety. Therefore, we genotyped 300 individuals (10 <b>individuals</b> per <b>variety</b> for 30 varieties) at seven SSR loci for the present study.|$|R
