5|$|Scott's {{alterations}} proved {{successful in}} stabilising {{the tower and}} in serving {{the needs of the}} church, and the church remained little changed for the next 130years; the most notable alterations during this period were the replacement of <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> the chancel's two leper windows with stained glass images of Pre-Raphaelite knights by Edward Burne-Jones as a memorial to a young officer killed during the Boer War, and the painting of a mural over the chancel arch by John Ward depicting the events of Holy Week in modern dress and set in the Chilterns. In 1951 the church was Grade A listed.|$|E
5|$|The {{stained glass}} in the east window, dated 1856, was made by William Wailes. <b>The</b> <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> a south window in the chancel of 1909 was made by Morris & Co. The east window in the north aisle, dated 1920 is by Irene Dunlop. The stained glass window {{to the left of}} the pulpit was donated by the Greg family of Styal Mill. The stained {{glass in the}} window at the west end of the north aisle is to the memory of the wife of Edward John Bell, rector from 1870 to 1907, and was made by Clayton and Bell in 1877. The tower holds a ring of six bells, hung for change ringing, five of which were cast in 1787 by Rudhall of Gloucester, and the sixth by Charles and George Mears at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1847. A seventh, unused, bell dates from 1686 and has been noted as being of {{historical}} importance by the Church Buildings Council of the Church of England. The parish registers begin in 1629, and the churchwardens' accounts in 1612.|$|E

25|$|The {{glass melting}} {{enthalpy}} reflects {{the amount of}} energy needed to convert the mix of raw materials (batch) to a melt glass.

A pioneering article about the subject was written by Carl Kröger in 1953.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{one type}} of alumina rich fly ash (ARFA) with about 50 [*]wt% of alumina has been {{extensively}} investigated for alumina extraction in China. Due to the silica in ARFA, alumina extraction would have to generate {{a huge amount of}} solid waste. There is a growing interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>in</b> ARFA, because they are composed mainly of silica and could be removed prior to alumina extraction. <b>In</b> this work, <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>in</b> ARFA have been investigated by chemical methods, that is, acid and base digestions. The chemical compositions have been measured by XRF for ARFA from the digestion processes. The K 2 O standard, XRD, and FTIR spectroscopies were successfully used to define the digestions processes, and size analysis and SEM-EDX provided rich information on particle transformations. As a result, acid and base digestion methods were found to produce very similar results for <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>in</b> ARFA. <b>The</b> K 2 O standard was attributed to <b>the</b> formation of <b>glasses</b> by illites, and TiO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 were proposed to originate from ilmenite in alumina rich coals (ARC). Some implications of the results were also discussed for the alumina extraction from ARFA...|$|R

25|$|In World War II, Mainz was {{a target}} of Allied bombing {{multiple}} times. The cathedral was hit several times in August 1942. Most of the roofs burned, and the top level of the cloister was destroyed. The vault, however, withstood the attacks and remained intact. The damaged elements were restored as authentically as possible, a process which continued well into the 1970s. In addition, much of <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> the cathedral was replaced.|$|E
25|$|A further {{development}} of the tungsten-halogen bulb has a dichroic coating that passes visible light and reflects infrared radiation. <b>The</b> <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> such a bulb may be spherical or tubular.

The superheated filament emits more light without an increase in power consumption.|$|E
25|$|Because Taihōs hangars were {{completely}} enclosed, mechanical ventilation {{was the only}} means of exhausting fouled air and replacing it with fresh. Ventilation duct gates were opened on either side of hangar sections No. 1 and No. 2 and, for a time, the carrier's aft elevator was lowered to try to increase the draught. But even this failed to have any appreciable effect and, in any case, air operations were resumed about noon, requiring the elevator to be periodically raised as aircraft were brought up to the flight deck. In desperation, damage control parties used hammers to smash out <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> the ship's portholes.|$|E

25|$|Other {{challenges}} {{to the design of}} the facilities were presented by the museum’s sustainability initiatives. The use of natural light whenever possible challenged exhibit designers relying on carefully controlled light levels; this was solved by using curtains and glare-reducing paint colors. Other conflicts between construction and energy use included <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> the Observatory, which would have presented a problem in cooling the building on warm days. This was overcome by adding fritted glass to the windows in thin horizontal lines through the panes to decrease the transparency without affecting the views.
