25|$|During the American Civil War, the {{university}} closed in October 1863 and reopened in January 1866 with an enrollment of 78 students including veterans using an award of $300 {{granted by the}} General Assembly to injured soldiers younger than 30. In the same year, the legislature appropriated $2,000 {{for the creation of}} a College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. This was the result of the Morrill Act which was used to create land grant colleges across the nation. The agricultural department of {{the university}} opened on May 1, 1872. A portion of the funds were used <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> of the agricultural department in Dahlonega, Georgia which developed into North Georgia College, which in turn became the University of North Georgia after a 2013 merger. The Military Department of the university was abandoned in the years following the Civil War, but its campus at Milledgeville, including the former state capital building, became Georgia Military College.|$|E

25|$|In 1868 Arthur Hesketh Groom, in {{the service}} of Thomas Blake Glover's Glover and Co., came to Kobe <b>to</b> <b>{{establish}}</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> office of that company. In 1871, Groom helped establish Mourilyan, Heimann & Co. at Lot 101 of the foreign settlement with his Glover and Co. colleague Heimann, exporting Japanese tea and importing Ceylon tea. In 1895 Groom built a villa on land on the peak of Mount Rokkō borrowed under his son's name. Proceeding to sell off lots on the mountain to other foreigners, he laid the foundation for development on the mountain. Groom was also known as a sportsman, and was involved in the founding of both the Kobe Cricket Club and the Kobe Regatta & Athletic Club. Groom's private four-hole golf course, which he built in 1901 on Mount Rokkō, was the first golf course in Japan. In 1903, after the return of the settlement, this developed into the Kobe Golf Club, with a membership system. Groom also worked as president of the managing company of the Oriental Hotel from 1897 to 1916.|$|E
25|$|Wallace-Johnson {{left for}} London in February 1937 to appeal his case {{in front of}} the Privy Council and to also {{establish}} contacts for the WAYL. On his journey, he first stopped at Freetown to meet with a group interested in establishing a branch of the WAYL there. The Sierra Leoneans expressed genuine interest in the WAYL, but they hesitated <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> there before obtaining a copy of the league's constitution. Wallace-Johnson then continued on his journey before stopping in Paris, where he contacted the International Bureau of Youth in hopes of setting up a meeting with general secretary. However, the secretary was out of town, so Wallace-Johnson pressed on in his journey. On arrival to London, he began to strategise and plan his upcoming events. Besides presenting his appeal case to the Privy Council, Wallace-Johnson planned to establish a lobby in England to pursue claims on behalf of WAYL members and to campaign for a commission of inquiry into Gold Coast political, economic and educational affairs. He first contacted Arnold Ward of the Negro Welfare Association and Reginald Bridgeman of the League against Imperialism, two strong contacts he had made years before in Accra. Ward and Bridgeman sought to publicise Wallace-Johnson's objectives for colonial reform. Using a cautionary approach, the two men suggested that Wallace-Johnson seek the support of sympathetic members of Parliament, make another attempt at meeting with the general secretary of the International Bureau of Youth, and contact leaders of the youth movement in England. He immediately started working on Ward and Bridgeman's suggestions. He met with interest groups and Labour Party politicians during the day and delivered speeches at public gatherings and rallies at night.|$|E

Prior to this, UBS had operated {{through a series of}} correspondent banks and representative offices. Three years later, UBS opened a branch office in New York. The bank also established a UK subsidiary in 1975 and a U.S. subsidiary in 1979 to focus on building the bank’s presence in the underwriting of debt and equity securities. [...] Nevertheless, UBS, which had traditionally concentrated its efforts on the domestic Swiss market, was the last of the three largest Swiss banks <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> office in the U.S. and its securities operations were overshadowed by those of its two Swiss peers.|$|E

500|$|The Wirgman Building {{was erected}} around 1825 by William Vance {{to house the}} office of the newly {{established}} Romney branch of the Bank of the Valley of Virginia, which was headquartered in Winchester, Virginia. In an act of the Virginia General Assembly on February 5, 1817, the Bank of the Valley of Virginia was authorized to open branches in Berkeley, Hampshire, Hardy, and Jefferson counties if citizens in each of the aforementioned areas could raise 100,000 USD in stock <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch.</b> This provision was met when the necessary stock was raised, and the Bank of the Valley of Virginia branch in Romney was opened around 1825 in the Wirgman Building. In 1845, historian Henry Howe traveled through Romney and described the town as [...] "one of considerable business, and has a branch of the Bank of the Valley, several stores, and about 350 inhabitants." [...] The bank branch continued to operate from the Wirgman Building until the Bank of the Valley of Virginia in Winchester suspended its operations and those of its branches following the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861.|$|E

6000|$|... 9. The Parliament of Paris.--France had a wise ruler in Blanche, and a still {{better one}} in her son, Louis IX., who is better known as St. Louis, and who {{was a really good}} and great man. He was the first to {{establish}} the Parliament of Paris--a court consisting of the great feudal vassals, lay and ecclesiastical, who held of the king direct, and who had to try all causes. They much disliked giving such attendance, and a certain number of men trained to the law were added to them to guide the decisions. The Parliament was thus only a court of justice and an office for registering wills and edicts. The representative assembly of France was called the States-General, and consisted of all estates of the realm, but was only summoned in time of emergency. Louis IX. was the first king to bring nobles of the highest rank to submit to the judgment of Parliament when guilty of a crime. Enguerrand de Coucy, one of the proudest nobles of France, who had hung two Flemish youths for killing a rabbit, was sentenced to death. The penalty was commuted, but the principle was established. Louis's uprightness and wisdom gained him honour and love everywhere, and he was always remembered as sitting under the great oak at Vincennes, doing equal justice to rich and poor. Louis was equally upright in his dealings with foreign powers. He would not take advantage of the weakness of Henry III. of England to attack his lands in Guienne, though he maintained the right of France to Normandy as having been forfeited by King John. So much was he respected that he was called in to judge between Henry and his barons, respecting the oaths exacted from the king by the Mad Parliament. His decision in favour of Henry was probably an honest one; but he was misled by the very different relations of the French and English kings to their nobles, who in France maintained lawlessness and violence, while in England they were struggling for law and order. Throughout the struggles between the Popes and the Emperor Frederick II., Louis would not be induced to assist in a persecution of the Emperor which he considered unjust, nor permit one of his sons to accept the kingdom of Apulia and Sicily, when the Pope declared that Frederick had forfeited it. He could not, however, prevent his brother Charles, Count of Anjou, from accepting it; for Charles had married Beatrice, heiress of the imperial fief of Provence, and being thus independent of his brother Louis, was able <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> of the French royal family on the throne at Naples. The reign of St. Louis was a time of much progress and improvement. There were great scholars and thinkers at all the universities. Romance and poetry were flourishing, and influencing people's habits, so that courtesy, i.e. the manners taught in castle courts, was softening the demeanour of knights and nobles. Architecture was at its most beautiful period, as is seen, above all, in the Sainte Chapelle at Paris. This was built by Louis IX. to receive a gift of the Greek Emperor, namely, a thorn, which was believed to be from the crown of thorns. It {{is one of the most}} perfect buildings in existence.|$|E
