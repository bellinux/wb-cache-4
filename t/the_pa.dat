40|$|In {{the present}} study, we used newly {{developed}} F 11 generation mouse advanced intercross lines (AIL) to fine map Pas 1 â€“ 3 quantitative trait loci (QTL). The (A/J x C 57 BL/ 6) F 11 AIL mouse population {{was created by}} crossing lung tumor-resistant C 57 BL/ 6 mice with lung tumor-susceptible A/J mice. By selectively genotyping 30 % of the population, we have confirmed <b>the</b> <b>Pas</b> 1 QTL and narrowed it to an interval of 1. 0 cM or 1. 3 Mb {{in the vicinity of}} the Kras 2 gene. <b>The</b> <b>Pas</b> 2 QTL was detected by both ANOVA and regression analysis but not by MapMaker EXP/QTL software. In addition, an interaction between <b>the</b> <b>Pas</b> 1 and Pas 2 QTLs was revealed. However, <b>the</b> <b>Pas</b> 3 QTL was not confirmed in this study. It was either lost during the development of the AIL or too weak to be detected using AIL. <b>The</b> <b>Pas</b> 1 locus is now sufficiently fine-mapped that candidate gene(s) for <b>the</b> <b>Pas</b> 1 locus can be characterized by positional cloning. In this study, all 27 of the known or predicted genes located in <b>the</b> <b>Pas</b> 1 candidate region were characterized as possible candidate Pas genes. Six genes were selected for additional analyses because of their relevant function in tumorigenesis or allelic changes between A/J and C 57 BL/ 6 mice. The Lrmp gene bears amino acid polymorphisms among various mouse strains that are highly correlated with <b>the</b> <b>Pas</b> 1 allele status. <b>The</b> <b>Pas</b> 1 c 1 gene (RIKEN Ak 016641), encoding an intermediate filament tail domain-containing protein, produces alternatively spliced transcripts across inbred strains of mice, and its splicing pattern cosegregates with <b>the</b> <b>Pas</b> 1 allele. <b>The</b> genetic and expression data support these two genes as strong candidates for <b>the</b> <b>Pas</b> 1 locus. Of the other four genes (Eca 39, RIKEN Ak 015530, mHoj- 1, and Krag), no functional polymorphisms or differential gene expression were found in Eca 39, mHoj- 1, and Krag between lung tumor-susceptible and -resistant strains. The Ak 015530 carries an amino acid polymorphism, but this polymorphism does not cosegregate with mouse lung tumor susceptibility. Thus, these 4 genes are less likely candidates for <b>the</b> <b>Pas</b> 1 locus...|$|R

5|$|Other slip ramps {{were planned}} in the Philadelphia area at PA 29 near the Great Valley Corporate Center and at PA 252 in Valley Forge in the 1990s.

The turnpike commission approved funding for <b>the</b> <b>PA</b> 29 ramp in 2002.

5|$|Because a Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the sound, {{the output}} cannot simply be {{connected}} to a larger PA system if the volume onstage from the built-in amplifier is too quiet.

5|$|Phase {{truncation}} spurs can {{be reduced}} substantially {{by the introduction of}} white gaussian noise prior to truncation.

Often the improvement can be achieved without penalty because the DAC noise floor tends to dominate system performance. Amplitude truncation spurs can not be mitigated in this fashion. Introduction of noise into the static values held in the PAC ROMs would not eliminate the cyclicality of the truncation error terms and thus would not achieve the desired effect.|$|E

40|$|Plasmid pTC-F 14 {{contains}} a plasmid stability system called pas (plasmid addiction system), {{which consists of}} two proteins, a PasA antitoxin and a PasB toxin.

As both pTC-F 14 and pTF-FC 2 are highly promiscuous broad-host-range plasmids isolated from bacteria that share a similar ecological niche, the plasmids are likely to encounter each other. We investigated the relative efficiencies of the two stability systems and whether they had evolved apart sufficiently for each pas to stabilize a plasmid {{in the presence of the}} other. The three-component pTF-FC 2 pas was more efficient at stabilization of a heterologous tester plasmid than <b>the</b> two component <b>pas</b> of pTC-F 14 in Escherichia coli host cells (± 92 % and ± 60 % after 100 generations, respectively). The PasA antidote of each pas was unable to neutralize the PasB toxin of the other plasmid. <b>The</b> <b>pas</b> proteins of each plasmid autoregulated their own expression as well as that of <b>the</b> <b>pas</b> of <b>the</b> other plasmid. <b>The</b> <b>pas</b> of pTF-FC 2 was more effective at repressing <b>the</b> <b>pas</b> operon of pTC-F 14 than <b>the</b> <b>pas</b> of pTC-F 14 was able to repress itself or <b>the</b> <b>pas</b> of pTF-FC 2. This increased efficiency was not due to the PasC of pTF-FC 2. The effect of this stronger repression was that pTF-FC 2 displaced pTC-F 14 when the two plasmids were coresident in the same E. coli host cell. Plasmid curing resulted in the arrest of cell growth but did not cause cell death, and plasmid stability was not influenced by the E. coli mazEF genes. Articl...|$|R
