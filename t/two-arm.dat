25|$|The VAM Javelin saw {{considerable}} aesthetic {{changes with}} only minor technical ones. The VAM models included the same novelties as its AMC counterpart, {{such as new}} headlight bezels and grille, smooth front fender extensions and bumpers without divisions, larger tail lights without wraparound portions and a single central back-up light, larger side marker lights with both light and reflector sections in both amber and red, and new wheel cover designs resembling Magnum 500 wheels. The discontinuation of the central rear reflector {{in favor of the}} back-up light resulted in the addition of a fourth Javelin emblem placed on the right corner of the trunk lid. Two hood designs were available, the one with the Ram Air-type scoops at the front center, and a smoother one with the two rectangular stripped bulges. Despite this, no Ram Air system was ever offered for the car, at least at a factory level. In the interior, a new collapsible steering column with built-in ignition switch and anti-theft lock plus a new simulated <b>two-arm</b> three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central bulls eye emblem were present.

5000|$|In December 1922, the CFA {{undertook}} {{an initiative}} to both improve the street lighting {{in certain areas}} of the District of Columbia as well as design an aesthetically pleasing and uniform lamppost. Twelve designs were drafted by Captain John E. Wood, an engineer with the Army Corps of Engineers and a commissioner on the three-man Commission Government of the District of Columbia, and W.B. Hadley, a D.C. government electrical engineer. Designs ranged from a [...] "Millet post" [...] with a taller base to a huge 20 ft double-globe post designed to light plazas and traffic circles. Captain Wood presented a final revised lamppost design to the CFA on November 15, 1923. The post was designed by Wood with input from PEPCO officials. Because commissioners felt that adequate illumination could only be delivered by two lights, the post had a cross-arm at the top. The post simple in its design, contained room for electrical wires and equipment in its hollow shaft and base, and was easily cleaned. The <b>two-arm</b> model was initially rejected by the CFA, however, because the arms appeared [...] "stuck on" [...] and not integral to the design. There were also issues with servicing and cleaning the lights in the <b>two-arm</b> model. A one-globe lamppost was approved instead. The approve single-globe model came in both 15 ft and 18 ft models, and could deliver 981 candela.|$|E
5000|$|On February 1, 1924, the CFA took up {{the issue}} of the <b>two-arm</b> lamppost again. A 22 ft tall double-globe model was {{presented}} by Captain Wood. The electronics and interior were designed by Wood and James Gosling, an electrical engineer from Schenectady, New York. CFA member Henry Bacon (who also designed the Lincoln Memorial) designed the exterior of the double-globe post. The shaft was a slightly modified version of the Millet post. The cross-arms were in the Beaux-Arts style. The double-globe model could deliver 1177.2 candela, and was called the [...] "Bacon double-lamppost" [...] due to Henry Bacon's influence on its design.|$|E
50|$|The bike {{is driven}} by a {{synchronous}} motor with an output of 11 kW. The empty weight is 178 kg, and top speed is 120 km/h. The range of the batteries, with a capacity of 12.7 kWh, is specified to be between 150 and 200 km. In regenerative operation - for example when driving downhill or during regenerative braking - the synchronous machine energy is recycled into the battery system. The charging time for 80 per cent is 2.5 hours. The motorcycle has a wheelbase of 1,455 mm. It has a unique <b>two-arm</b> steering wheel hub and {{is reminiscent of the}} layout of the Majestic.|$|E
50|$|Where {{interlockings}} {{are closely}} placed, a Starting signal arm may be fitted above a Distant signal arm. In {{this case the}} Starting arm can be placed at Stop and display a red light. As the lower Distant signal arm cannot be cleared while the upper arm is at Stop the signal will show two red lights. The basis for Double Light signalling was thus established by a sequence of Distant and <b>two-arm</b> signals, {{so that it was}} then possible to encounter a signal showing two green lights (Clear), followed by a green light over a red light (Caution) then one or two red lights (Stop).|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Screamin' Swing {{consists of}} a 62 ft A-frame, supporting two arms. Each arm supports two rows of seating, back to back. The first Screamin' Swings developed had four seats per arm with two arms. The lowest variant is the four-seat/one-arm design, and the capacities increase to 8 seat, 16 seat, 32 seat, and 40 seat designs, all utilizing two arms. For <b>two-arm</b> models, the swings can operate individually or simultaneously (although in opposite directions) and are propelled by compressed air, provided by Ingersoll Rand or Sullair compressors. These compressors disperse air into tanks located within the arms, the movement triggering actuators and cables to produce the motion.

50|$|In {{microwave}} systems, {{a spiral}} antenna {{is a type}} of RF antenna. It is shaped as a <b>two-arm</b> spiral, or more arms may be used. Spiral antennas were first described in 1956. Spiral antennas belong to the class of frequency independent antennas which operate over a wide range of frequencies. Polarization, radiation pattern and impedance of such antennas remain unchanged over large bandwidth. Such antennas are inherently circularly polarized with low gain. Array of spiral antennas can be used to increase the gain. Spiral antennas are reduced size antennas with its windings making it an extremely small structure. Lossy cavities are usually placed at the back to eliminate back lobes because a unidirectional pattern is usually preferred in such antennas. Spiral antennas are classified into different types; archimedean spiral, square spiral and star spiral etc. Archimedean spiral is the most popular configuration.|$|E
50|$|On 22 June 1913 {{the first}} {{automatic}} signals in Australia were brought into use between Eveleigh Loco Junction (Illawarra Junction) and Sydenham, replacing Tyer's One-Wire Block.

From that time on, a form of Track Circuit Block (TCB) worked from mechanical and power signalboxes, with the gradual spread of automatic signalling between stations, became the standard for new installations, initially with semaphore but later colour light signals. In practice, the term Track Circuit Block was generally shortened to 'Track Block', of which {{there were a number}} of (mainly administrative) variations in the rules, such as Double Line Track Block and Single Line Track Block. Track Circuit Block, now known officially as the Rail Vehicle Detection system, remains the standard system of train signalling on all main lines in the RailCorp network.|$|E

5000|$|The {{power-operated}} three-position upper quadrant semaphore signal, American in origin, {{was introduced}} to New South Wales by the English signal engineer, Mr C.B. Byles, in 1913. Mr Byles (1871-1948) led New South Wales Railways through its introduction of power signalling, from 1911 until 1929. [...] At night, two lights, one above the other, are exhibited. The spectacle attached to the signal arm has three lenses, that is a green for the vertical clear position and red for the other two lenses. In some cases the semaphore arm moves to the horizontal danger position when {{the line between the}} distant signal and the stop signal to which it applies is occupied. The Distant signals capable of exhibiting Danger are fitted with an upper red/green spectacle; the two-position versions have a fixed upper green. The Home/Starting signals give three indications. The arm moves from horizontal displaying a red light, upwards to 45 degrees displaying a green or yellow light, and fully vertical also displaying a green light. In double light areas, the lower light of these signals stays red until a full Clear indication is shown. Therefore, these signals will show the same lights indicated by the Lower Quadrant Semaphore Distant and <b>two-arm</b> signals, that is, two greens for Clear, a green over a red for Caution and two reds for Stop.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Test-retest {{reliability}} of the Functional Reach Testwas examined in childrenwith typical development by comparing standard and alternate methods. Methods: Eighty subjects ages seven to 16 years were tested and 69 retested for four methods of Functional Reach Test (ie, one-arm finger-to-finger, <b>two-arm</b> finger-to-finger, one-arm toe-to-finger, and <b>two-arm</b> toe-to-finger). Intraclass correlation coefficients and limits of agreement were calculated. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients were high in toe-to-finger measure-ment methods (0. 97 – 0. 98) for the entire group and specific age groups (00. 83 – 0. 93). Toe-to-finger methods were more reliable than finger-to-finger methods. The <b>two-arm</b> toe-to-finger method had the best limis of agreement with approximately 5 cm indicated by the 95 % confidence interval.
