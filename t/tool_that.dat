40|$|International audienceAs cloud {{computing}} becomes a widely used technology, {{it is essential}} to provide mechanisms and <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> enable trust about how personal data is dealt with by cloud providers. The Cloud Accountability (A 4 Cloud) project tries {{to solve the problem of}} ensuring trust in the cloud by providing <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> support the process of achieving accountability. In this paper we will concentrate on some specific <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> were demonstrated and discussed during the A 4 Cloud workshop held in association with the IFIP Privacy Summer School in Edinburgh in 2015. In particular, we will describe <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> facilitate the appropriate choice of a cloud provider such as the Cloud Offerings Advisory Tool (COAT) and the Data Protection Impact Assessment <b>Tool</b> (DPIAT), <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> are in charge of controlling the data of the users such as the Data Track (DT) <b>tool,</b> and <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> help specify and enforce accountability related policies by using the Accountability-Primelife Policy Language (A-PPL) and an associated enforcement engine...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We briefly {{present a}} {{software}} methodology for safety-critical software, developed {{over many years}} to cope with industrial safety-critical applications in the Canadian nuclear industry. Following this we present discussion on software <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> {{have been used to}} support this methodology, and software <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> could be used, but have not been used for a variety of reasons. Based on our experience, we also present and motivate a list of high-level requirements for <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> would facilitate the development of safety-critical software using the presented methods, together with a small number of <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> we believe are worth developing in the future. ...|$|R

The succession of characters (as well as places) that replace each other without fully developing on their own (or blocked from developing, in a sense) represent Carpentier's view of the social context in which forces are preventing characters from developing.|$|E

5|$|Olaf {{formed from}} a {{tropical}} wave {{that left the}} coast of Africa on September 17. Over {{the next two weeks}} it moved westbound into the East Pacific Ocean. Initially, the wave was not in an environment conductive for further development. However, on October 2, a low-level circulation was noted on satellite imagery. This circulation quickly became better defined over the next several hours while located 400 miles (645km) south of Acapulco, Mexico. The next day, Dvorak Classifications, a <b>tool</b> <b>that</b> estimates a tropical cyclone intensity, were placed at 1.5. This is equivalent to winds of around 30mph (50km/h). In addition, a ship nearby reported winds of 35mph (45km/h). Microwave imagery also indicated that the center was near the associated convection. Based on this, the system was upgraded into a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Rouffaer {{reported}} that the gringsing pattern was already known by the 12th century in Kediri, East Java. He concluded that this delicate pattern could be created only by using the canting, an etching <b>tool</b> <b>that</b> holds a small reservoir of hot wax, and proposed that the canting was invented in Java around that time. The carving details of clothes worn by East Javanese Prajnaparamita statues from around the 13th century show intricate floral patterns within rounded margins, similar to today's traditional Javanese jlamprang or ceplok batik motif. The motif is thought to represent the lotus, a sacred flower in Hindu-Buddhist beliefs. This evidence suggests that intricate batik fabric patterns applied with the canting existed in 13th-century Java or even earlier.|$|E
5|$|The ATA Secure Erase {{command is}} {{designed}} to remove all user data from a drive. With an SSD without integrated encryption, this command will put the drive back to its original out-of-box state. This will initially restore its performance to the highest possible level and the best (lowest number) possible write amplification, {{but as soon as}} the drive starts garbage collecting again the performance and write amplification will start returning to the former levels. Many tools use the ATA Secure Erase command to reset the drive and provide a user interface as well. One free <b>tool</b> <b>that</b> is commonly referenced in the industry is called HDDErase. Gparted and Ubuntu live CDs provide a bootable Linux system of disk utilities including secure erase.|$|E

5|$|The {{extended}} line {{of research}} that culminated in Astronomia nova (A New Astronomy)—including the first two laws of planetary motion—began with the analysis, under Tycho's direction, of Mars' orbit. Kepler calculated and recalculated various approximations of Mars' orbit using an equant (the mathematical <b>tool</b> <b>that</b> Copernicus had eliminated with his system), eventually creating a model that generally agreed with Tycho's observations to within two arcminutes (the average measurement error). But he was {{not satisfied with the}} complex and still slightly inaccurate result; at certain points the model differed from the data by up to eight arcminutes. The wide array of traditional mathematical astronomy methods having failed him, Kepler set about trying to fit an ovoid orbit to the data.|$|E
5|$|The initial Windows {{release was}} criticized by players for several {{perceived}} shortcomings. The game was shipped with SecuROM copy protection that required activation from 2K Games' servers over the Internet; the unavailability of these servers was reported {{as the reason}} for the cancellation of the game's midnight release in Australia. Players found that the SecuROM limited the number of times the game could be activated to two; user feedback led to 2K Games to increase the activation count to five, and later offer a <b>tool</b> <b>that</b> allowed users to revoke previous activations on their own. Ultimately 2K Games removed the activation limit, though retail versions of the game still required the activation process. Levine admitted that their initial approach to the activation process was malformed, harming their reputation during the launch period.|$|E

5|$|These {{limitations}} {{have caused}} problems. For example, before 2005, DST in Israel varied {{each year and}} was skipped some years. Windows 95 used rules correct for 1995 only, causing problems in later years. In Windows 98, Microsoft marked Israel as not having DST, forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks manually twice a year. The 2005 Israeli Daylight Saving Law established predictable rules using the Jewish calendar but Windows zone files could not represent the rules' dates in a year-independent way. Partial workarounds, which mishandled older time stamps, included manually switching zone files every year and a Microsoft <b>tool</b> <b>that</b> switches zones automatically. In 2013, Israel standardized its daylight saving time according to the Gregorian calendar.|$|E

He kept control of the program using a management <b>tool</b> <b>that</b> he devised for himself—a looseleaf notebook, more than a hundred pages in length, that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of the important developments that had taken place and decisions that needed to be made. Presented with the notebook on Thursday evenings, Shea would study and annotate it over the weekend and return to work with new questions, instructions, and decisions. This idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever-expanding program.|$|E
