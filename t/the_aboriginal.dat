5000|$|In the introduction, Smith {{writes about}} the Yukon Native Brotherhood seeking a {{settlement}} that is fair and just both for the Yukon First Nations and the Government of Canada. In the second part, Smith discusses the struggles of <b>the</b> <b>Aboriginals</b> of Canada in recent history since European colonization, which altered their lives. Smith highlighted the major events that altered the Aboriginals’ way of life. He included the Fur Trade, the Klondike Gold Rush of 1896, Residential Schools, and construction of the Alaska and Dawson highways. In the third part, he explored contemporary issues of the early 1970s. Smith tried to break the stereotype of <b>the</b> Yukon <b>Aboriginals</b> at <b>the</b> time, challenging stereotypes by the Whiteman. Smith also provided <b>the</b> <b>Aboriginals</b> perspective on <b>the</b> Whiteman. He acknowledges {{the distinction between the}} cultures of the Whiteman and <b>the</b> <b>Aboriginals,</b> saying that is why <b>the</b> <b>Aboriginals</b> must have <b>the</b> ability to manage their own societies. Smith demonstrates that such a settlement can benefit the future generations. In the fourth part, titled [...] "Tomorrow," [...] Smith explained how the Yukon First Nations would use their independence if a settlement was reached.

5|$|Dunstan pursued similar reforms {{with respect}} to Indigenous Australians. In 1962, <b>the</b> <b>Aboriginal</b> Affairs Bill was {{introduced}} to liberalise constraints that had been placed on Indigenous Australians {{in the past and}} had effectively resulted in segregation. The initial proposal still retained some restrictions, placing more controls over full-blooded Aborigines. Dunstan was prominent in Labor's opposition to the double standards, and called for abolition of race-based restrictions, saying that social objectives could be achieved without explicit colour-based schemes. He was successful in forcing amendments to liberalise controls on property and the confinement of Indigenous Australians to reserves. However, his attempt to remove the different standards required of part and full-blooded Aborigines failed, as did his proposal to ensure that {{at least half of the}} members of <b>the</b> <b>Aboriginal</b> Affairs Board be Indigenous Australians. Despite the passage of the bill, restrictions remained in place and Dunstan questioned the policy of assimilation of Aborigines, which he saw as the diluting of their distinctive cultures.|$|E
