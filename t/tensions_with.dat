5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Powell {{was elected to}} the U.S. Senate. Before he could assume office, President James Buchanan {{dispatched}} Powell and Major Benjamin McCulloch to Utah to ease <b>tensions</b> <b>with</b> Brigham Young and the Mormons. Powell assumed his Senate seat on his return from Utah, just prior to the election of Abraham Lincoln as president. Powell became an outspoken critic of Lincoln's administration, {{so much so that the}} Kentucky General Assembly asked for his resignation and some of his fellow senators tried to have him expelled from the body.

5|$|In {{spite of}} its {{military}} accomplishment, Japan's international reputation was blackened by the Nanking Massacre, {{as well as by}} a series of international incidents that occurred during and after the battle. Most notable among them were the shelling by Japanese artillery of the British steamship Ladybird on the Yangtze River on December 12, and the sinking by Japanese aircraft of the American gunboat Panay not far downstream on the same day. The Allison Incident, the slapping of an American consul by a Japanese soldier, further increased <b>tensions</b> <b>with</b> the United States.|$|E

However, soon after his election, Mutharika experienced <b>tensions</b> <b>with</b> Muluzi after implementing an anti-corruption program, which distracted the government from addressing the nation's food and HIV/AIDS-related crises. Despite these obstacles, Mutharika successfully developed a National AIDS Policy and appointed a Principal Secretary for HIV/AIDS during his presidency.|$|E

After the crisis subsided, financial problems forced Chile put the ship up for sale in early 1903; concerned that Russia might buy them, the United Kingdom stepped in and purchased the still-incomplete ships from Chile on 3 December 1903 for £2,432,000. The ship was designed to Chilean specifications, particularly the requirement to fit in the graving dock at Talcahuano, and was regarded by the British as a second-class battleship.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat of}} a French {{invasion}} passed, and peace was declared in 1558. Attention shifted away from Portland, and a 1574 survey reported that the castle was in a poor condition, with similar concerns being repeated in 1583. <b>Tensions</b> <b>with</b> Spain grew and military attention focused on {{the threat to the}} south-west of England. War broke out in 1585, and £228 was spent on renovating Portland Castle. In 1596, the garrison still comprised a captain and 13 men.|$|E
5|$|With the {{situation}} in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations. With the Soviets wary of mounting <b>tensions</b> <b>with</b> Germany and the Japanese planning {{to take advantage of}} the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in Southeast Asia, the two powers signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941. By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border.|$|E

5|$|After {{peace was}} {{achieved}} with France in 1558, military attention shifted towards the Spanish {{threat to the}} increasingly prosperous south-west side of England. <b>Tensions</b> <b>with</b> Spain grew and invasion appeared likely in 1589, resulting in royal permission being given to reuse the stonework from the East Blockhouse for new coastal defences, but this work was not carried out. The fort continued to decay until the 20th century. With {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War in 1939, the East Blockhouse was adapted for use by the British military. The interior was cleared out and a shed was built in one corner. A slit trench was dug {{on the north side of}} the building, a rifle embrasure formed on the east side of the building, and a machine-gun position was dug out and protected with sandbags outside it.|$|E
5|$|After rising <b>tensions</b> <b>with</b> Mexico {{following}} the United States' annexation of Texas, {{war broke out}} in 1846. During the conflict, Grant distinguished himself as a daring and competent soldier. Before the war, President John Tyler had ordered Grant's unit to Louisiana {{as part of the}} Army of Observation under Major General Zachary Taylor. In September 1846, Tyler's successor, James K. Polk, unable to provoke Mexico into war at Corpus Christi, Texas, ordered Taylor to march 150 miles south to the Rio Grande. Marching south to Fort Texas, to prevent a Mexican siege, Grant experienced combat {{for the first time on}} May 8, 1846, at the Battle of Palo Alto.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the War of 1812, as the British post in Florida was {{evacuated}} the Corps' Florida detachment {{was paid}} off and disbanded. Although several men accompanied the British to Bermuda, the majority continued to live in settlements around the wooden stockade the Corps had garrisoned (which had become a symbol of slave insurrection). This legacy of a community of armed fugitive slaves with a substantial arsenal would lead to <b>tensions</b> <b>with</b> the United States of America. Those remaining later took part in the Battle of Negro Fort in July 1816, after which they joined the southward migration of Seminoles and African Americans escaping the American advance. Members of the Colonial Marine battalion who were deployed on the Atlantic coast withdrew from American territory. They would continue in British service as garrison-in-residence at Bermuda until 1816, when the unit was disbanded and the ex-Marines resettled on Trinidad.|$|E

40|$|If the B-mode signal in the CMB {{polarization}} {{seen by the}} BICEP 2 {{experiment is}} confirmed, it has dramatic implications for models of inflation. The result is also in <b>tension</b> <b>with</b> Planck limits on standard inflationary models. It is therefore important to investigate whether this signal can arise from alternative sources. If so, this could lessen the pressure on inflationary models and the <b>tension</b> <b>with</b> Planck data. We investigate whether vector and tensor modes from primordial magnetic fields can explain the signal. We find that in principle, magnetic fields generated during inflation can indeed produce the required B-mode, for a suitable range of energy scales of inflation. In this case, the primordial gravitational wave amplitude is negligible, {{so that there is}} no <b>tension</b> <b>with</b> Planck and no problems posed for current inflationary models. However, the simplest magnetic model is in <b>tension</b> <b>with</b> Planck limits on non-Gaussianity in the trispectrum. It may be possible to fine-tune the magnetogenesis model so that this non-Gaussianity is suppressed. Alternatively, a weaker magnetic field can pass the non-Gaussianity constraints and allow the primordial tensor mode to be reduced to r~ 0. 09, thus removing the <b>tension</b> <b>with</b> Planck data and alleviating the problems with simple inflationary models.
