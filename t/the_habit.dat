5|$|Mummification was a {{tradition}} that many other pre-Columbian civilisations practiced. On the Altiplano, <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> of conserving the dead started in the Herrera Period, around the 5th century AD. The Muisca continued this culture and prepared their deceased beloved {{members of the society}} by putting the bodies above fires. The heat would dry the body and the phenol conserve the organs and protect them from decomposition, a process that took up to eight hours. After drying, the bodies were wrapped in cotton cloths and placed in caves, buried, or in some cases placed on elevated platforms inside temples, such as the Sun Temple. The position of the mummies was with their arms folded across the chest and the hands around the chin, while the legs were placed over the abdomen. During the preparation of the mummies, the Muisca played music and sang songs honouring their dead. <b>The</b> <b>habit</b> of mummification continued well into the colonial period; the youngest mummies found date from {{the second half of the}} 18th century.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{followed}} the usual course {{of reading the}} law {{in order to obtain}} his license to practice. In 1756, he became an apprentice in the office of John Putnam, a leading lawyer in Worcester. In 1758, he earned an A.M. from Harvard, and the following year was admitted to the Massachusetts bar, having completed his studies under Putnam. From an early age, he developed <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> of writing descriptions of events and impressions of men which are scattered through his diary, which included his report of the 1761 argument of James Otis Jr. in the Massachusetts Superior Court as to the legality of Writs of Assistance.

5|$|Characteristic {{diagnostic}} {{features of}} Entoloma murrayi include the bright yellow coloring, the conical cap, cube-shaped spores, and club-shaped cheilocystidia.

E.murrayi has <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> and form of some similarly colored mushrooms in the genus Hygrocybe (such as Hygrocybe marginata var. concolor), {{but it can be}} readily distinguished from those by its salmon-pink spore print, non-waxy gills, and the angular shape of its spores. Entoloma luteum is a duller yellow color, with a less distinctly pointed umbo. The South American species E.dennisii, originally misidentified as E.murrayi, can be distinguished from the latter by its less conical cap and considerably smaller spores that measure 5.5‚Äì7Œºm.|$|E
