5|$|Federer and Nadal {{met in a}} major final for {{the first}} time since the French Open in 2011. The match between <b>the</b> <b>perennial</b> but aging archrivals was {{anticipated}} due to speculation of this possibly being their last contest in a major final, the potential tennis history made from either victory and subsequent implications on their respective legacies, and the match's relevance towards discussing either man as being 'the greatest tennis player of all time'.|$|E

However, Grant differed from Traditionalists like René Guénon and Ananda Coomaraswamy in his positive assessment of Western occultism. Moreover, Grant's appreciation of Asian spiritual traditions has {{much in common with}} Theosophy, although Grant differed from the Theosophical movement with his valorisation of the 'left hand path'.|$|E

5|$|Al-Muktafi {{also kept}} up <b>the</b> <b>perennial</b> {{conflict}} with the Byzantine Empire, with varying success. In May 902, al-Qasim ibn Sima al-Farghani was appointed {{in command of the}} frontier districts of the Jazira. In 902 or 903, a naval raid reached the island of Lemnos, dangerously close to the Byzantine capital, Constantinople; the island was plundered and its inhabitants carried off into slavery. Nevertheless, in May 903, the newly appointed governor of Tarsus, Abu'l-Asha'ir Ahmad ibn Nasr, was dispatched to the frontier districts with gifts for the Byzantine ruler, Leo VI the Wise (r. 886–912), and in return, Byzantine envoys arrived in Baghdad for negotiations on a prisoner exchange. The exchange eventually took place in September–October 905, at the river Lamus in Cilicia, but was interrupted because the Byzantines reneged on the agreed terms. After further negotiations, the exchange was completed in August 908.|$|E

5|$|The Western Ghats {{form one}} of the four {{watersheds}} of India, feeding <b>the</b> <b>perennial</b> rivers of India. The major river systems originating in the Western Ghats include Godavari, Kaveri, Krishna, Thamiraparani and Tungabhadra. Majority of streams draining the Western Ghats join these rivers and carry large volume of water during the monsoon months. These rivers flow to the east due to the gradient of the land and drain out into the Bay of Bengal. Major tributaries include Kali, Bhadra, Bhavani, Bhima, Malaprabha, Ghataprabha, Hemavathi and Kabini. Periyar, Bharathappuzha, Netravati, Sharavathi, Mandovi and Zuari rivers flow westwards towards the Western Ghats, draining into the Arabian Sea and are fast-moving, owing to the steeper gradient.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Acre, Edward's {{international}} role changed {{from that of a}} diplomat to an antagonist. He had long been deeply involved in the affairs of his own Duchy of Gascony. In 1278 he assigned an investigating commission to his trusted associates Otto de Grandson and the chancellor Robert Burnell, which caused the replacement of the seneschal Luke de Tany. In 1286, Edward visited the region himself and stayed for almost three years. <b>The</b> <b>perennial</b> problem, however, was the status of Gascony within the kingdom of France, and Edward's role as the French king's vassal. On his diplomatic mission in 1286, Edward had paid homage to the new king, Philip IV, but in 1294 Philip declared Gascony forfeit when Edward refused to appear before him in Paris to discuss the recent conflict between English, Gascon, and French sailors (that had resulted in several French ships being captured, along with the sacking of the French port of La Rochelle).|$|E
5|$|The {{setting was}} principally based on Norway, and the {{cultural}} influences in the film come from Scandinavian culture. Several landmarks in Norway appear in the film, including the Akershus Fortress in Oslo, the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, and Bryggen in Bergen. Numerous other typical cultural Scandinavian elements are {{also included in the}} film, such as stave churches, trolls, Viking ships, a hot spring, Fjord horses, clothes, and food such as lutefisk. A maypole is also present in the film, as well as the brief appearance of runes in a book that Anna and Elsa's father opens to figure out where the trolls live. A scene where two men argue over whether to stack firewood bark up or bark down is a reference to <b>the</b> <b>perennial</b> Norwegian debate over how to stack firewood properly. The film also contains several elements specifically drawn from Sámi culture, such as the usage of reindeer for transportation and the equipment used to control these, clothing styles (the outfits of the ice cutters), and parts of the musical score. Decorations, such as those on the castle pillars and Kristoff's sled, are also in styles inspired by Sámi duodji decorations. During their field work in Norway, Disney's team, for inspiration, visited Rørosrein, a Sámi family-owned company in the village Plassje that produces reindeer meat and arranges tourist events. Arendelle was inspired by Nærøyfjord, a branch of Norway's longest fjord Sognefjorden, which has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site; while a castle in Oslo with beautiful hand-painted patterns on all four walls served as the inspiration for the kingdom's royal castle interior.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine identification methods {{that could be used}} to differentiate annual and perennial plant types within the species Poa annua L. Thereafter, Poa annua plants were collected from numerous turfed areas in three Northern Pacific Coastal regions and identified as annual or perennial biotypes. It was found that annual growth forms were characterized by lower leaf and node numbers, lower secondary tiller numbers, and lower adventitious root numbers. The annuals also reached reproductive maturity quicker than <b>the</b> <b>perennials</b> and had a greater percentage of flowering tillers at the completion of the test. Morphological characteristics that were not useful included blade length and width, ligule length, culm length, inflorescence characteristics, primary tiller number, shoot and root dry weight, and seminal root number. An examination of seed characteristics showed a post harvest dormancy requirement in annual Poa annua. Seed from perennial types germinated immediately following harvest. Poa annua plants collected from numerous turfed locations were identified as annual or perennial biotype based on the above differences, It was found that in excess of 50 percent of <b>the</b> samples exhibited <b>perennial</b> characteristics and that both types were quite evenly distributed throughout Oregon and Western Washington. Results showed that <b>the</b> <b>perennials</b> were most often collected from areas that received moderate or intensive supplemental irrigation. The annuals predominated in non-irrigated golf course roughs. Descriptive botanical literature on variation in Poa annua indicated that the subspecies taxonomic designation would be appropriate to distinguish between <b>the</b> annual and <b>perennial</b> types. It was suggested that all annuals be classified in the subspecies annua and <b>the</b> <b>perennials</b> in subspecies reptans...|$|R

30|$|The second {{migration}} model {{presumes that}} <b>the</b> r-type <b>perennial</b> might have originated from an ancestor that evolved in Asia, {{which was also}} {{a contributor to the}} Asian O. rufipogon gene pool because our recent crossing experiment has shown that Jpn 1 can generate fertile progeny in crosses with Asian wild rice (data in preparation). O. meridionalis may have been in Australia long before the r-type. Populations related to the ancestor of <b>the</b> r-type <b>perennial</b> may now be extinct in Asia, or have evolved to become modern O. rufipogon because we have not found the Australian r-type in Asian genetic resources when we have screened the core collection and other material. Independently from <b>the</b> r-type <b>perennial,</b> <b>the</b> m-type <b>perennial</b> could have been the result of adaptive divergence from a common ancestor to O. meridionalis to occupy a particular niche where annuals could not fit. Our preliminary data on reproductive barriers indicates that Jpn 2 does not produce much fertile pollen in hybrids with O. rufipogon (< 10 %) or O. meridionalis (< 20 - 40 %). This pollen fertility produced no seeds in glass house. A reproductive barrier may have developed between <b>the</b> annual and <b>perennial</b> populations. However, because they share an ancestral lineage, they have similar morphological and molecular signatures.|$|R
