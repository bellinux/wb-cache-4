The financial situation was always tight, and taught everyone in the family discipline and to work hard to survive. To support the family, Alma worked as an accountant and clerk. Philipp's father paid a monthly alimony of 35 Reichsmark (RM) until 1933. Initially he had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> by his mother of his obligations.

He reviewed the recent history of the missions and stated so as the purpose of the apostolic letter.

25|$|Despite these improvements, Garcia's {{physical}} and mental condition continued to decline throughout 1993 and 1994. Due to his frail condition, he began to use narcotics again to dull the pain. By the beginning of 1995, his playing ability had suffered {{to the point where}} he would often turn down the volume of his guitar, a problem exacerbated by carpal tunnel syndrome and the ongoing loss of feeling in his extremities from diabetes. On the band's final tours, he frequently had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> of what song he was performing.|$|E

[...] "The concept of freedom is one that's universally positive and timeless, and whatever each person's version of that freedom is, it's a good thing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reminding</b> people or even just ourselves <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 'free'", Whitford stated.|$|R

25|$|In 1959, Shirley {{moved to}} New York City and quickly married {{magazine}} photographer Hans Lownds; Shirley was his third wife. Lownds persuaded her {{to change her}} name to Sara because his first wife named Shirley had left him {{and he did not}} want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> of his previous marriage. Sara and Hans lived in a five-story house on 60th Street in Manhattan, between Second and Third Avenues. Sara had a modeling career and appeared in Harper's Bazaar as the 'lovely luscious Sara Lownds'—then became pregnant. Their daughter Maria was born October 21, 1961.

25|$|When the 1970 Roman Missal allowed laypeople {{to receive}} both species {{of bread and}} wine, it insisted that priests should use the {{occasion}} to teach the faithful the Catholic doctrine on the form of Communion, as affirmed by the Council of Trent: they were first <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> that they receive the whole Christ when they participate in the sacrament even under one kind alone, and thus are not then deprived of any grace necessary for salvation. The circumstances in which this was permitted were initially very restricted, but were gradually extended. Regular distribution of Communion under both kinds requires {{the permission of the}} bishop, but bishops in some countries have given blanket permission for the administration of Communion in this way.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} half of the Victorian era, there was a more or less {{negative}} view of women's styles of the 1795–1820 period. Some people would have felt slightly uncomfortable <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> that their mothers or grandmothers had once promenaded about in such styles (which could be considered indecent according to Victorian norms), and many would have found it somewhat difficult to really empathize with (or take seriously) the struggles of a heroine of art or literature if they were being constantly reminded that she was wearing such clothes. For such reasons, some Victorian history paintings of the Napoleonic wars intentionally avoided depicting accurate women's styles (see example below), Thackeray's illustrations to his book Vanity Fair depicted the women of the 1810s wearing 1840s fashions, and in Charlotte Brontë's 1849 novel Shirley (set in 1811–1812) neo-Grecian fashions are anachronistically relocated to an earlier generation.|$|E

25|$|In March 2000, {{the band}} {{completed}} their debut lp I Guess Sometimes I Need <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Reminded</b> of How Much You Love Me, which was subsequently released by 4AD (where they remain signed today) to great critical acclaim in some quarters. The BBC {{used one of}} the tracks from this album, 'So Much As Hold My Hand', on their World Service as the theme music for links between programmes and news bulletins. Their work since this LP has included collaborations with Kim Deal and Kelley Deal, King Creosote, James Yorkston, The Mountain Goats and Sonic Boom. In 2004, Magnétophone's track 'Kel's Vintage Thought', co-written with The Breeders' Kelley Deal, was voted by listeners of BBC 6 Music as the Rebel Playlist winner on the Steve Lamacq show. Their second lp, The Man Who Ate The Man, was released in 2005 and was voted best avant-post rock lp of 2005 by Piccadilly Records. Shortly after its release, in late 2005, Magnétophone recorded a session for BBC Radio 1's Blue Room show at the Maida Vale Studios, and for BBC Radio 1's Rob da Bank show, both broadcast in November 2005.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{allowed the}} commissioners to lease the tolls for periods {{of up to}} seven years, and the first lease was granted to Charles Chaplin, one of the commissioners who held ten shares, in January 1770. He agreed to pay a rent of 4 per cent per year to the other shareholders, and to {{contribute}} a maximum of £500 per year towards maintenance costs. If more than £500 was needed, the commissioners were to supply any additional amounts. Although Chaplin had an option to renew the lease after 7 years, {{he did not do}} so, and no other takers could be found. The commissioners then negotiated with Chaplin, and revised terms were agreed. In return for a 99-year lease, he would fund all repairs, pay the salaries of the officers of the canal, and pay 5 per cent interest to the subscribers. Clearly, the 99-year lease was not authorised by the enabling Act, but nobody challenged its legality for over 50 years. Chaplin was not thorough in carrying out his side of the bargain and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> that he had not been paying the interest in 1782 and again in 1788.|$|E
