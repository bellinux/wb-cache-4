5|$|While lions do {{not usually}} hunt people, some (usually males) seem {{to seek out}} human prey; one well-publicised case {{includes}} the Tsavo maneaters, where 28 officially recorded railway workers building the Kenya-Uganda Railway were taken by lions over nine months during {{the construction of a}} bridge over the Tsavo River in Kenya in 1898. The hunter who killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals' predatory behaviour. The lions were larger than normal, lacked manes, and one seemed to suffer from <b>tooth</b> <b>decay.</b> The infirmity theory, including <b>tooth</b> <b>decay,</b> is not favoured by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that while <b>tooth</b> <b>decay</b> may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans.|$|E

This study aimed to assess the dentition status of elderly population staying in Islamic Religious Community Setup, “Pondok” in Kelantan. A cross sectional study involving 369 elderly people was carried out. A simple random sampling method was utilized for {{the selection of the}} subjects. Oral examination was done to assess the dentition status and data was analyzed using SPSS 11. 5 version. The response rate was 95. 6 %. Majority of the subjects were edentulous (81. 0 %). The mean number of natural teeth, functional natural <b>teeth,</b> <b>decayed</b> <b>teeth</b> (D), missing teeth (M) and teeth indicated for extraction (X) were 3. 22 (SD 7. 54), 2. 75 (SD 6. 70), 0. 06 (SD 0. 48), 28. 80 (SD 7. 51) and 0. 41 (SD 1. 60) respectively. Among 70 dentate subjects, the mean number of natural teeth, functional natural teeth, occluding pair of functional natural <b>teeth,</b> <b>decayed</b> <b>teeth</b> (D), missing teeth (M), teeth indicated for extraction (X) and DMFX(T) index were 17. 1 (SD 8. 00), 14. 5 (SD 8. 11), 6. 3 (SD 4. 22), 0. 3 (SD 1. 06), 15. 1 (SD 8. 20), 2. 2 (SD 3. 14) and 17. 6 (SD 8. 08) respectively.

5|$|A lack of {{fluorine}} in {{the diet}} {{is the cause of}} a greatly increased incidence of dental caries.

5|$|Lemurs {{generally}} have thin tooth enamel compared to anthropoid primates.

Little other dental health information is available for lemurs, except that wild ring-tailed lemurs at Berenty Private Reserve occasionally exhibit abscessed maxillary canines (seen as open wounds on the muzzle) and <b>tooth</b> <b>decay,</b> possibly due to the consumption of non-native foods.|$|E
5|$|Population {{studies from}} the mid-20th century onwards show topical {{fluoride}} reduces dental caries. This was first {{attributed to the}} conversion of tooth enamel hydroxyapatite into the more durable fluorapatite, but studies on pre-fluoridated teeth refuted this hypothesis, and current theories involve fluoride aiding enamel growth in small caries. After studies of children in areas where fluoride was naturally present in drinking water, controlled public water supply fluoridation to fight <b>tooth</b> <b>decay</b> began in the 1940s and is now applied to water supplying 6 percent of the global population, including two-thirds of Americans. Reviews of the scholarly literature in 2000 and 2007 associated water fluoridation with a significant reduction of <b>tooth</b> <b>decay</b> in children. Despite such endorsements and evidence of no adverse effects other than mostly benign dental fluorosis, opposition still exists on ethical and safety grounds. The benefits of fluoridation have lessened, possibly due to other fluoride sources, but are still measurable in low-income groups. Sodium monofluorophosphate and sometimes sodium or tin(II) fluoride are often found in fluoride toothpastes, first introduced in the U.S. in 1955 and now ubiquitous in developed countries, alongside fluoridated mouthwashes, gels, foams, and varnishes.|$|E

Methods: Subjects were 612 community dwelling Thai aged 60 years or older. A questionnaire was evaluate socio-demographics, general oral health assessment index (GOHAI) and world health organization quality of life (WHOQOL). Oral examinations assessed <b>teeth</b> present, <b>decayed</b> <b>teeth,</b> gingival bleeding, pocket depth, functional tooth units (FTUs) and salivary flow rate.   Results: For dentate subjects (n= 428), logistic regression showed that <b>teeth</b> present, <b>decayed</b> <b>teeth,</b> gingival bleeding, pocket depth, FTUs and saliva flow rate were associated with GOHAI (p< 0. 05). Regarding WHOQOL, teeth present, gingival bleeding and FTUs were associated with physical domain (p< 0. 05). Teeth present, <b>decayed</b> <b>teeth,</b> gingival bleeding and FTUs were related with psychological domain (p< 0. 05). Teeth present and FTUs were associated with environmental and social domain (p< 0. 05). For edentulous subjects (n= 184), denture wearing was associated with GOHAI and all domains of WHOQOL (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The number of teeth present, denture wearing and FTUs strongly affected GOHAI and general QOL. Dental caries, periodontal status and salivary flow rate also affected GOHAI and some domains of general QOL of elderly. </p...|$|R

5|$|Since most {{toothache}} is {{the result}} of plaque-related diseases, such as <b>tooth</b> <b>decay</b> and periodontal disease, the majority of cases could be prevented by avoidance of a cariogenic diet and maintenance of good oral hygiene. That is, reduction in the number times that refined sugars are consumed per day and brushing the teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and flossing. Regular visits to a dentist also increases the likelihood that problems are detected early and averted before toothache occurs.

Data were analyzed using Correlation test and Regression analysis. Results: The overall mean of decayed, missed, and filled teeth index in the children of this study was 7. 61 ± 3. 80. There were significant reverse correlations between this index and age (r = - 0. 176), and fruit consumption (r = - 0. 155) (P 0. 05).

5|$|Methamphetamine (meth), {{a highly}} {{addictive}} drug {{that produces a}} dramatic increase in energy and euphoria, can have negative health effects that include serious dental problems. , it is the most discussed illegal drug in dental literature. The most notable effect of long-term use of methamphetamine on dental health is the development of caries (tooth decay); the teeth of some drug users appear to be dark and in the process of disintegrating. Caries often occur in the cervical regions of teeth, where the tooth surface narrows at the junction of the crown and the root. It is usually found on the buccal (cheek) side of the teeth and on tooth surfaces that are adjacent to incisors and canines; eventually, the coronal tooth area, near the crown, can be affected by the decay and erosion. The dental caries of meth mouth often progress slowly, perhaps because their advancement is hindered by intermittent hygienic practices. The decay can lead to tooth fractures and severe pain. In some cases, teeth are permanently damaged and must be removed. Along with malnutrition and weight loss, the dental effects of methamphetamine use contribute to the appearance of premature aging seen in some users.
