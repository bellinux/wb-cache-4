6000|$|... "Now, Billy, {{remember}} we're {{not going}} to take up with the first piece of land we see. We've got <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> with our eyes open--" ...|$|E
6000|$|He did not {{laugh at}} this; on the contrary, his face darkened. [...] "I've heard about that. Did he advise your uncle <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> same {{transportation}} company?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know, Miss Chatterton, I have {{accepted}} your brother's invitation <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> Suffolk <b>this</b> summer, {{and that you}} are to be plagued with me and my pointers again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I seem <b>to</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> {{business}} {{with too much}} precipitation," [...] he reflected, with a deadly sigh. [...] "I fear it seems too ramified for a person of my powers of mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See {{that this}} man be {{securely}} confined until we have time <b>to</b> <b>go</b> deeper <b>into</b> <b>this</b> affair," [...] he commanded, [...] "and as bars alone seem inadequate to restrain him, let chains be added." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps so--if {{you ever}} untangle," [...] said the young man, {{smiling at the}} {{whimsical}} speech. Then {{he turned to his}} young bride. [...] "Do you want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> thing, Louise?" [...] he asked.|$|E
6000|$|Again Edwards drew near, and pled {{in a low}} voice: [...] "See here, Mr. Ranger, I {{have special}} reasons why I don't want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> town under arrest. I wish you'd let me explain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He backs {{himself to}} crawl--until he crawls triumphantly right over you.... I don't {{like to think}} of the dream he has.... I take it he will lose. Is it fair <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> game with him?" ...|$|E
30|$|<b>To</b> <b>go</b> further <b>into</b> <b>this</b> 2 D {{structural}} analysis, {{it could}} be very interesting to construct a 3 D geometric model considering the real trajectories of the wells and the actual 3 D geometry of the faults.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{may live}} a month, Mr. Paret, he may die to-morrow. He ought never <b>to</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> campaign, {{he knew he}} had this trouble. Hepburn warned him three months ago, and there's no man who knows more about the heart than Hepburn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean Mr. Krebs oughtn't never <b>to</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> campaign," [...] he answered, relenting a trifle, {{perhaps at}} {{the tone of}} my voice. [...] "He knew it, too, {{and some of us}} fellows tried to stop him. But we couldn't do nothing with him," [...] he added dejectedly.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{why is he}} so keen about it, anyway? It don't seem nat'ral for a {{business}} man built after Johnson's style, and a rich man to boot, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> detective business. It ain't the reward, we know that. Is it an old grudge?" ...|$|E
60|$|A roar of musketry {{drowned out}} the words, and {{immediately}} Ben's company found itself all but surrounded. <b>To</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> quagmire had certainly been a grave error, but all leaders make mistakes sometimes; and Major Morris was suffering as greatly as his men.|$|E
6000|$|Her face clouded. [...] "He's {{not at all}} well. He {{is older}} than he realizes. I can see he is failing, and he ought not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> senatorial fight." [...] After a pause she said: [...] "He was quite ill in March, and I nursed him; he seemed very grateful, and we've been very good friends since." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you've {{an hour or}} so to spare, Mr. Jacks," [...] he said, [...] "I'd like <b>to</b> <b>go</b> right <b>into</b> <b>this</b> with you, if {{it would}} {{interest}} you any. It's my business over here, so naturally I am glad enough of an opportunity to talk it over." ...|$|R
50|$|More recently, {{the nuns}} have been {{learning}} {{the art of}} mani, an oral storytelling tradition that communicates the spiritual and cultural values of Tibetan Buddhism to lay audiences and threatens <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> extinction without <b>this</b> important revival.|$|R
6000|$|... "We are <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the Hunters' <b>this</b> evening, uncle," [...] Isobel said, {{as she sat}} down. [...] "There {{is going}} to be a famous juggler there. There is a note for you from Mrs. Hunter on the side table." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is never}} worth while," [...] Harcutt said, [...] "to reject a {{possibility}} {{until you have}} tested and proved it. What you say, however, settles this one. They are not adventurers in any sense of the word. Now, will you answer me a few questions? It {{may be just as}} much to your advantage as to mine <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You wouldn't had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> place {{many times}} {{more if you}} hadn't been so wicked, for by {{tomorrow}} night we'd been away from this circus an' {{on the way to}} home an' Uncle Dan'l. Now you've spoiled my chance an' your own for a good while to come, an' I hope before the day is over you'll feel as bad about it as I do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you do, though; oh, I feel it! The fact is, John, I haven't a {{particle}} of constitution; and, if I {{should try to}} go on as Grace does, it would kill me in a month. Ma never would {{let me try to}} do any thing; and, if I did, I was sure to break all down under it: but, if you say so, I'll try <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> school." ...|$|E
50|$|Another Godiva {{appeared}} in Superman/Batman #2 {{as a member}} of an alternate universe team of villains called the Axis of Evil.

60|$|On a side-table stood a huge {{steaming}} can {{which had}} attracted La Boulaye's {{attention from the}} moment that he had entered the room. He <b>went</b> <b>to</b> peer <b>into</b> <b>this,</b> and found it full almost to the brim of mulled red wine.|$|R
25|$|Magdeburg {{managed to}} remain in the league, {{finishing}} twelfth, and averaging 4,500 spectators, but in June 2002 the club had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> receivership. <b>This</b> led <b>to</b> the club's relegation to tier IV, and almost all players left the club and 1. FC Magdeburg had to manage the next season with players from their youth department and their reserves. This young team finished tenth in the Oberliga Nordost-SÃ¼d and won the Saxony-Anhalt-Cup for a fifth time. Despite this negative development, average attendance stayed at the same level.|$|R
60|$|That's all he said, and that's all I said. It warn't {{no use to}} say any more; {{because when}} he said he'd do a thing, he always done it. But I couldn't make out how he was willing <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> thing; so I just let it go, and never bothered no more about it. If he was bound to have it so, I couldn't help it.|$|E
60|$|While Wallace and Phonny {{had been}} conversing thus, {{they had been}} riding through a wood which {{extended}} along a mountain glen. Just at this time {{they came to a}} place where a cart path branched off from the main road, toward the right. Phonny proposed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> path to see where it would lead. Wallace had no objection to this plan, and so they turned their horses and went in.|$|E
6000|$|... 'All right, General,' said he, 'but I {{calculate}} we ain't {{quite ready}} yet. The gentlemen, my predecessors, what stood in that thar canister, didn't {{volunteer for the}} office--not much! And I guess there was some ornamental tyin' up before the big stroke was made. I want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> thing fair and square, so I must get fixed up proper first. I dare say this old galoot can rise some string and tie me up accordin' to sample?' ...|$|E
50|$|In 1896, the Illinois National Bank was {{overtaken}} by disaster, largely through the mismanagement of others. In {{the last days}} of December 1896 it was forced <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> liquidation. <b>This</b> resulted in heavy pecuniary loss to Schneider, and wiped out of existence an institution which he had spent {{more than a quarter of}} a century in building up. Saddened by this event, the later years of his life were spent in practical retirement, much of it with one of his daughters in Kansas City.|$|R
50|$|In 1906 and 1907 fires {{burned down}} his two {{photographic}} studios leading to bankruptcy. Between the 2 fires, his first {{son was born}} March 16, 1907. He became debt free by 1909, although stone broke, and ready to start again. In 1907, outstanding diagnostic successes in the family helped his confidence. He again refused an offer <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> business, <b>this</b> time with homeopath Dr. Wesley H. Ketchum from Hopkinsville, who was introduced by his father.

50|$|In 1979, he {{pioneered the}} {{development}} of the first, integrated-circuit, data modem using Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) silicon switched-capacitor filters and a patented Automatic Gain Control circuit. This was the first mixed analog-digital integrated circuit/system <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> manufacture. <b>This</b> technology has now grown into a multi-billion dollar industry. In the 1980s Tompsett applied himself to finding a solution to a major challenge to reduce the size, power and cost of digitizing video signals from imagers and scanners. He invented an integrated, two-step recycling video analog-digital converter.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{all very}} pretty and pleasant, and I'm glad it went off so well," [...] said Rose Ferguson the next day; [...] "but I have not the {{smallest}} desire to repeat any thing of the kind. We {{who live in the}} country, and have such a world of beautiful things around us every day, and so many charming engagements in riding, walking, and rambling, and so much to do, cannot afford <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> sort of thing: we really have not time for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{island of}} Ceylon being {{inhabited}} {{for the greatest}} part by barbarians, which will not allow any trade or commerce with any European nation, and inaccessible by any travellers, it will be convenient to relate the occasion how {{the author of this}} story happened <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> island, and what opportunities he had of being fully acquainted with the people, their laws and customs, that so we may the better depend upon the account, and value it as it deserves, for the rarity as well as the truth of it; and both these the author gives us a brief relation of in this manner. His words are as follows: ...|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly {{he came to}} some conclusion. [...] "You {{would need}} to go disguised," [...] he said. [...] "The city is {{intensely}} excited, and the discovery of your presence among them might create a fearful tumult. Still this wish of yours <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> city--this idea of yours--. Yes, now I think the thing over, {{it seems to me}} not altogether--. It can be contrived. If you would really find an interest in that! You are, of course, Master. You can go soon if you like. A disguise Asano will be able to manage. He would go with you. After all it is not a bad idea of yours." ...|$|E
