5|$|In 2000, Rodríguez {{suffered}} a season-ending injury {{in a game}} against the Anaheim Angels. While trying to make a throw to second base, his thumb made contact with <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> <b>of</b> Mo Vaughn's bat. He fractured his right thumb and underwent surgery the next day. This injury caused him to miss the rest of the season. Rodríguez appeared in just 91 games, which was the fewest that he appeared in since his first season in the league, 1991. His nine home runs in April matched a team record that was shared (through 2008) with Alex Rodriguez (2002), Carl Everett (2003), and Ian Kinsler (2007). Even though he was injured, he was still named to the second-team of Baseball America's Major League Baseball All-Star Team.|$|E
5|$|Born in Kirkheaton, Hirst first {{achieved}} {{success for}} Yorkshire as a bowler who could bat a little. Over his first few seasons, his batting {{developed at the}} expense of his bowling until he was regarded mainly as a specialist batsman. Around 1900, his bowling re-emerged when he discovered a method to make the ball swing in the air after he released it. He {{was one of the first}} bowlers to control <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> <b>of</b> the ball; batsmen found it very difficult to counter this method and Hirst's bowling was subsequently far more successful. From 1903 he achieved 11 consecutive doubles. He set records in 1905, when he scored 341 runs in an innings against Leicestershire—still the highest total for Yorkshire as of 2015—and in 1906, when he completed an unprecedented and unrepeated double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets. In many seasons, he battled injury which reduced his effectiveness, but his bowling remained successful until shortly before the First World War. Hirst played in all England's home Test series between 1899 and 1909, but his record for England was less impressive than his record for Yorkshire and he may have suffered from playing in Australia where playing conditions did not suit him.|$|E

500|$|The Daddies are {{generally}} labeled as swing and/or ska band by the media, and their music is largely composed of various interpretations of both genres, ranging from traditional jazz and big band-influenced forms to modernized pop and rock fusions. During their commercial {{breakthrough in the}} 1990s, critics conceived terms such as [...] "punk swing", [...] "power swing" [...] and [...] "big band punk rock" [...] to describe the Daddies' unique approach to these fusions, mixing [...] "the propulsion of swing beats and rabbit-punch bursts of brass with grimy rebel-rock guitars to give the jumpin' jive sound a much-needed facelift". The Pacific Northwest Inlander wrote of this style in 1994, [...] "atop <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> <b>of</b> the band's jazz you can hear strains of Parliament-Funkadelic, crumbs of barrelhouse rhythm and blues, snippets of ska, and huge whiffs of in-your-face punk rock", likening the Daddies to [...] "Cab Calloway-meets-Johnny Rotten, or the Duke Ellington Orchestra pumped up on steroids and caffeine".|$|E
500|$|Alongside his {{intellectual}} pursuits Cardus played and followed cricket.

I can still see <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> <b>of</b> MacLaren's bat, the great follow-through finishing high and held there with the body poised". In 1902 he saw the Test match against Australia in which Victor Trumper scored a century before lunch and thereby won a permanent place among Cardus's heroes. Cardus first played cricket on rough waste land close to his home in Rusholme; as he matured he developed as an effective medium-paced off break bowler, and for several seasons from 1908 onwards he played as a weekend professional in Manchester league cricket. [...] "I am not ashamed to confess that I seldom hesitated, as soon as a batsman came to the crease, to let him have a quick one bang in the penis; after which a quick, simple straight one would invariably remove him from the scene".|$|E

Before {{the release of the}} song, Banks described the single as giving [...] "Detroit house vibes with major Diana Ross teas". Entertainment Weeklys Dylan Kickham compared the song to that of Banks' work on her debut album, in the sense that both contain [...] "fast, aggressive rap verses over a dancefloor-ready electronic beat and a sing-song bridge", although did not clarify whether this was good or bad. Gregory Adams from Exclaim! thought that the track [...] "fit with various early '90s house sounds, from club synths to a jazzed-up digi-hi-hat beat", and went on to describe the song's lyrics as [...] "maintaining the precarious balance between staying true to the streets while popping up on magazine covers". D-Money from Soul Bounce was enthusiastic in his review, writing [...] "'The Big Big Beat' comes out of the gate swinging with a fat, squelchy synth bass intro and a vocal sample. 'Guess who up in this b***h,' Azealia begins, bringing <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> <b>of</b> programmed drums and hi-hats along with her as the groove kicks up the bpm and the party really gets started. She continues flipping her usual boastful rhymes that hit as hard as the kick drum thumps, then things smooth out just a bit as AB flexes her vocals on the chorus". Ione Gamble of Dazed noted Banks' use of softer vocals on the single, compared to that of her previous work, while Brennan Carley of Spin described the song's instrumental work as [...] "glittery synthesizers", alluding that Banks had returned [...] "swinging and vogueing" [...] on the song.|$|E

[...] Before the season finale aired, Jensen ranked this as the second best moment {{of the season and}} put the scene in which the monster attacks the mercenaries in ninth place. [...] Dan Kois and Lane Brown of New York magazine thought that this [...] "episode didn't exactly feel like the usual moderately paced, secret-revealing drama Lost usually is; it felt like an action movie... it was like watching Die Hard on an island". [...] Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a 9.3/10, concluding that [...] "if 'The Shape of Things to Come' is any indication of the level of quality that [...] should expect from here on out then we are in for some incredible storytelling" [...] and [...] "Alex's death will probably be remembered as one of the more pivotal scenes in the entire series [...] it is such a phenomenally shot, edited and acted moment... it would be incredibly hard not to feel for [...] here." [...] Upon grading the best episodes of the first five seasons, the episode ranked second, beating episodes like [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] and the pilot and losing to [...] "The Constant." [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad summed up [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] as [...] "a brilliant episode... tons of action, several big revelations, and more questions to ponder". [...] Don Williams of BuddyTV decided that the episode was [...] "worth waiting five weeks for" [...] and [...] "so jam packed that I need to give my brain time to rest". [...] Williams's colleague Oscar Dahl ranked the scene in which Alex is killed as the fifth best moment of the season, noting that [...] "it was perfectly paced... and provided a huge shock... and some of the best acting you'll ever see". [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post wrote that [...] "'The Shape of Things to Come' was the perfect episode to get everyone back into <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> <b>of</b> Lost. [...] It wasn't a [...] à la 'The Constant'. [...] It was an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride, which to me matched the 'Pilot' bombastic grandeur".|$|E

After applying corrections for the finite amplitude of swing, the buoyancy of the bob, the barometric pressure and altitude, and temperature, he obtained a value of 39.13929inches for the seconds pendulum at London, in vacuum, at sea level, at 62°F. The largest variation from the mean of his 12 observations was 0.00028 in. representing a precision of gravity measurement of 7×10−6 (7 mGal or 70 µm/s2).

[...] To allow the band to create what Holder described as a [...] "really first class album", the band decided to take some time off from touring: [...] "We decided not to rush the album, like we have done on past recording sessions.
