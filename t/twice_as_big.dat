40|$|This work aims {{to present}} some {{preliminary}} {{results on the}} evaluation of clear sky sounding retrievals operationally processed at DSA-CPTEC/INPE. Radiances are from AIRS, GOES 10, MODIS and HIRS sounder sensors. The inverse solution is solved using five different processing packets (i. e. IMAPP, IAPP, GOES, MODIS, NASA-AIRS). The vertical sounding profiles are evaluated through the comparison with radiosonde from the MiniBarca campaign over the Amazon region. The statistical analyses of the temperature profiles are based on bias, {{root mean square error}} and correlation coefficient. Biases and RMSE changes are function of the retrieval scheme and sensor spectral resolution. NASA and IMAPP algorithms applied to AIRS sensors tend to represent the temperature inversion observed close to surface, while other retrieval seems to neglect it. AIRS and GOES 10 and MODIS (AQUA and TERRA) present high temperature correlation (i. e. R > 0. 8) with radiosonde data at lower levels (below 900 mbar) while HIRS present lowest correlation of 0. 6. The statistical analyses of the humidity for GOES 10 and NOAA 18 - the only sensors used at present moment to infer moisture at DSA-CPTEC/INPE - shows that the mean error is lower than 10. 5 g/kg for GOES 10 and is almost <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>bigger</b> for HIRS-NOAA 18. Overall, the retrieved temperature and moisture profiles are in reasonable good agreement with radiosondes. However, the results indicate stronger moisture biases than temperature biases. Further analyses must be carried out on the sources errors, such as initial conditions, radiances biases and cloud mask. Pages: 1647 - 165...|$|R

500|$|The submariners had {{won over}} Navy strategists, but their {{equipment}} {{was not yet}} capable of handling their secret mission. [...] The challenge of designing appropriate new boats became a high priority by 1934, and was solved in 1936 as the first new long-range, all welded submarines were launched. Even better were the S-class Salmon class (launched in 1937), and its successors the T-class or Tambor submarines of 1939 and the Gato class of 1940. The new models cost about $5–6 million each. At 300 feet in length and 1500 tons, they were <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> as the German U-boats, but still highly maneuverable. In only 35 seconds they could crash dive to 60 feet. The superb Mark 3 TDC Torpedo Data Computer (an analog computer) took data from periscope or sonar readings on the target's bearing, range and angle on the bow, and continuously set the course and proper gyroscope angle for a salvo of torpedoes until the moment of firing. Six forward tubes and 4 aft were ready for the 24 Mk-14 [...] "fish" [...] the subs carried. Cruising on the surface at 20 knots (using 4 diesel engines) or maneuvering underwater at 8-10 knots (using battery-powered electric motors) they could circle around slow-moving merchant ships. New steels and welding techniques strengthened the hull, enabling the subs to dive as deep as 400 feet {{in order to avoid}} depth charges. Expecting long cruises the 65 crewmen enjoyed good living conditions, complete with frozen steaks and air conditioning to handle the hot waters of the Pacific. The new subs could remain at sea for 75 days, and cover 10,000 miles, without resupply. The submariners thought they were ready—but they had two hidden flaws. The penny-pinching atmosphere of the 1930s produced hypercautious commanders and defective torpedoes. Both would have to be replaced in World War II.|$|E
