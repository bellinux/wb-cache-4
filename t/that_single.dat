5|$|Chad was {{represented}} by one male athlete at the 2016 Games in athletics – Bachir Mahamat in the 400 metres. Mahamat competed on 12 August in the second heat. He placed seventh, {{with a time of}} 48.59 seconds, some 3.44 seconds behind the winner, Bralon Taplin of Grenada. The only runner he placed ahead of in his heat was Anas Beshr of Egypt, who had been disqualified for exiting his lane on the track. Only the first three athletes from each heat progressed to the next round, and so Mahamat's Olympics ended after <b>that</b> <b>single</b> run. His time placed him in 48th place out of 50 athletes overall, based on times in the first round.|$|E

5|$|However, later {{research}} suggests that the initial stability of the implant in bone is a more important determinant of success of implant integration, rather than a certain period of healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the implant is placed in and the number of implants splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand high torque (35 Ncm) and are splinted to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or bone loss between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months. The corollary is <b>that</b> <b>single</b> implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to minimize the risk of initial failure.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 Briskin was {{embroiled in}} a {{controversy}} related to the control of MGM. As part of a battle between Joseph R. Vogel and Joseph Tomlinson, Briskin was brought in {{as a member of}} the Board of Directors of MGM, along with MGM's former production head, Louis B. Mayer, and also as a producer for the studio. However, the special board meeting which was held to appoint the two executives was held to be illegal by the Delaware Chancery Court, and the Mayer and Briskin appointments were overturned. The conflict continued on throughout the year, until MGM held a stockholders' meeting in October. During the meeting, the shareholders agreed to expand the board by adding ten new directors. Tomlinson's group was clearly routed, gaining only a single seat of the ten; <b>that</b> <b>single</b> seat was Briskin.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 a {{research}} team including Alena Grabowski, Rodger Kram and Hugh Herr conducted a follow-up study of single amputees with running blades {{which was published}} in Biology Letters. Each of six amputees' affected leg performance was compared against that of their biological leg. The team measured leg swing times and force applied to the running surface on a high-speed treadmill at the Biomechanics Laboratory of the Orthopedic Specialty Hospital, and also studied video of sprint runners from the Olympics and Paralympics. They found no difference in leg swing times at different speeds, and recorded leg swing times similar to that of non-disabled sprinters. They also found <b>that</b> <b>single</b> running blades reduced the foot to ground force production of the tested runners by an average of 9 percent. Because force production is generally considered the most significant factor in running speed, the researchers concluded that this reduction in force limited the sprinters' top speed. Grabowski also found that amputees typically increased their leg swing times to compensate for the lack of force.|$|E

5|$|The double burden <b>that</b> <b>single</b> mothers endure has a {{historical}} precedent, and still exists currently.

They may face job discrimination and not earn as much, {{so there will be}} further difficulties in maintaining the double burden. Single-mother families tend to hover near the poverty line, with a poverty rate that is twice as high of that for men.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} {{tempered}} this achievement. Despite shooting down two more aircraft, {{it was the}} first time he had lost his wingman. Unteroffizier Johann Kalb had to bail out over the Volga River and was captured by Soviet troops. On 17 September he claimed three more victories but a 20mm Soviet cannon-shell went through his canopy, narrowly missing his head. On 23 September, he scored a remarkable ten victories in three missions, taking him to 197. On 26 September, he became the first pilot in aviation history to claim 200 enemy aircraft shot down. The 62 victories he claimed in <b>that</b> <b>single</b> month (of September) remain a record unbeaten in aviation history. Elevated to hero status by the Luftwaffe, he was promoted to Major on 29 September and forbidden from flying further combat missions. The whole of JG52 gathered at Soldatskaja to congratulate him before he flew back to Berlin a few days later.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} December 2008, Keenan had {{mentioned}} that he and Howerdel had passively and separately been writing new material for A Perfect Circle, although the band would officially remain in hiatus and largely out of {{the view of the}} public through mid-2010. On September 2010, the band officially announced the end of their hiatus, indicating they would again return to live performances. Keenan, Howerdel, Freese, and Iha all returned to their respective roles, though, with Lenchantin and White unavailable, the band recruited Matt McJunkins, touring bassist for Ashes Divide and Puscifer, to join as bassist. The performances, running through the end of 2010, included traveling to five separate cities for three nights of shows in each city, with each night containing a complete, in-order performance of one of each of their three albums - Mer de Noms, Thirteenth Step, and Emotive - notably being the first time most of the material from the latter had ever been performed live. Throughout the year the band would discuss the prospect of new material, but with uncertainty. Keenan continued to insist that logistics and industry trends made recording another full album unlikely, and <b>that</b> <b>single</b> one-off songs would be more likely. Howerdel noted that he had been writing material and presenting rough demos to Keenan since 2008, but that much of the material {{was in a state of}} flux, some being accepted by Keenan as potential A Perfect Circle material, while other being rejected by Keenan, and/or saved by Howerdel for a prospective Ashes Divide release in the future.|$|E
