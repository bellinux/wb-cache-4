50|$|<b>Transfer</b> <b>molding</b> (BrE moulding) is a {{manufacturing}} process where casting material is {{forced into a}} <b>mold.</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>molding</b> is different from compression molding in that the mold is enclosed Hayward rather than open to the fill plunger resulting in higher dimensional tolerances and less environmental impact. Compared to injection <b>molding,</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>molding</b> uses higher pressures to uniformly fill the mold cavity. This allows thicker reinforcing fiber matrices to be more completely saturated by resin. Furthermore, unlike injection <b>molding</b> the <b>transfer</b> <b>mold</b> casting material may start the process as a solid. This can reduce equipment costs and time dependency. The transfer process may have a slower fill rate than an equivalent injection molding processes.|$|R
50|$|OOA curing {{achieves}} {{the desired}} fiber content and elimination of voids {{by placing the}} layup within a closed mold and applying vacuum, pressure, and heat by means other than an autoclave. An RTM press is the typical method of applying heat and pressure to the closed mold. There are several out of autoclave technologies in current use including resin <b>transfer</b> <b>molding</b> RTM), Same Qualified Resin <b>Transfer</b> <b>Molding</b> (SQRTM), vacuum-assisted resin <b>transfer</b> <b>molding</b> (VARTM), and balanced pressure fluid molding. The most advanced of these processes can produce high-tech net shape aircraft components.|$|R
50|$|The {{material}} {{most commonly}} used for transfer molding is a thermoset polymer. This type of polymer is easy to mold and manipulate, but upon curing, hardens into a permanent form. For simple homogeneous <b>transfer</b> <b>molded</b> parts, the part is simply made of this plastic substrate. On the other hand, resin transfer molding allows for a composite material {{to be made by}} placing a fiber within the mold and subsequently injecting the thermosetting polymer.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Transfer</b> <b>molded</b> {{products}} are usually thin walled, 1/16" [...] to 3/16", {{and are the}} most prevalent type in use today. The process uses vacuum forming and take-off or transfer molds, where the mold is an extremely fine wire mesh {{in the shape of}} the upper/exposed surface. The fibrous slurries are frequently made up of a high percentage or entirely of recycled newspaper, which produces a relatively smooth surface on one side and a fairly smooth surface on the opposite side with good accuracy and definition.|$|E

50|$|The mold {{interior}} surfaces may be gel-coated. If desired {{the mold}} is first pre-loaded with a reinforcing fiber matrix or preform. Fiber {{content of a}} <b>transfer</b> <b>molded</b> composite can {{be as high as}} 60% by volume. The fill material may be a preheated solid or a liquid. It is loaded into a chamber known as the pot. A ram or plunger forces material from the pot into the heated mold cavity. If feed-stock is initially solid, the forcing pressure and mold temperature melt it. Standard mold features such as sprue channels, a flow gate and ejector pins may be used. The heated mold ensures that the flow remains liquid for complete filling. Once filled the mold can be cooled at a controlled rate for optimal thermoset curing.|$|E
5000|$|Because voids {{are viewed}} as defects in {{composite}} materials, many methods are applied for reducing voids in composites. Traditionally, using vacuum bagging system and autoclave under pressure and heat will minimize or prevent voids from forming. [...] The vacuum bagging system combined with autoclave is a common method used in industrial processes to achieve a low void content for thermoset composites. Vacuum evacuation is the way reducing exciting amount of voids by physically transporting the voids out of the resin and fiber network through vacuum lines, and it {{is influenced by the}} viscosity of resin. Autoclave pressure is used to assist vacuum in removing trapped air and excess resin {{while at the same time}} preventing volatiles from coming out of the resin at high temperatures [...] Optimization of injection flow rate is often calculated to minimize voids in Resin <b>Transfer</b> <b>Molded</b> (RTM) composites. During the injection phase, a liquid resin impregnates the fibers before curing and solidification, often creating voids in the part during the injection.

40|$|International audienceComposites {{are being}} {{increasingly}} used in various applications {{because of their}} light weight and high performance. One of the common disadvantages of composite materials is the formation of defects during manufacturing such as voids and dry spots that adversely affect mechanical and physical properties. Although void formation mechanisms and analytical prediction of performance degradation due to voidage have been studied in more detail, knowledge of morphology and spatial variation of voids in resin <b>transfer</b> <b>molded</b> composites is limited. In this work, the radial and through-the-thickness variation of void morphology in a resin <b>transfer</b> <b>molded</b> composite disk is investigated. A resin <b>transfer</b> <b>molded</b> composite disk is fabricated using a mixture of epoxy resin EPON 815 C and curing agent EPICURE 3282. The molding is achieved by injecting the mixture into a center-gated mold cavity preloaded with randomly-oriented glass preform, yielding a fiber volume fraction of 18 %. After demolding, a radial sample is {{cut out of the}} disk and embedded into a quick cure acrylic resin for subsequent polishing. Spatial void distribution as well as the shape and size of voids are investigated along the radial axis and through the thickness of the disk. The studied cross-section is divided into three radial regions. Each region is subsequently divided into three thickness layers. Using 200 X magnification, each layer and region is scanned, and the images of identified voids are captured. Image Tool® software is utilized to determine the area and maximum length of each void.
