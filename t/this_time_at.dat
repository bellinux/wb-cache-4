The loan extension was completed on 28 December 2007.|$|E
5|$|During <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> Carlisle, Warner {{made several}} {{significant}} contributions to football offense, including the body block technique and the single- and double-wingback formations. Under Warner, Carlisle quarterback Frank Mount Pleasant and fullback Pete Hauser became two of the first regular spiral passers in football (the forward pass was legalized in 1906). In 1908 he introduced the technique of body blocking, instead of blocking with the shoulders.|$|E

5|$|At {{about this}} time, civil strife {{broke out in}} Corinth between the {{democratic}} party and the oligarchic party. The democrats, supported by the Argives, launched an attack on their opponents, and the oligarchs were driven from the city. These exiles went to the Spartans, based at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> Sicyon, for support, while the Athenians and Boeotians came up to support the democrats. In a night attack, the Spartans and exiles succeeded in seizing Lechaeum, Corinth's port on the Gulf of Corinth, and defeated the army that came out to challenge them the next day. The anti-Spartan allies then attempted to invest Lechaeum, but the Spartans launched an attack and drove them off.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's kickoff was fielded {{inside the}} Virginia Tech five-yard line and {{returned}} to the Tech eight-yard line. Tech gained five yards on two running plays, then Noel completed a 15-yard pass to Davis for a first down at the Tech 28-yard line. Noel and Jones each carried the ball, together gaining enough for a first down at the Tech 39-yard line. A completed pass and a short run by Jones resulted in another first down, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> the 50-yard line. Florida State committed a five-yard offsides penalty, but the Hokies were unable to gain a first down on the Seminoles' side of the field. Rather than attempt to convert another fourth down, the Hokies punted the ball.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} time that season, Barcelona played Real Madrid in El Clásico, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> the Santiago Bernabéu. Barcelona won the {{historic}} match 2–6, which was the largest margin of victory by which Barcelona had won in Madrid since the 1970s, when Johan Cruyff led Barcelona to win 0–5. On 6 May 2009, Barcelona played against Chelsea in the second leg of the Champions League semi-finals. Following a goalless first leg, Chelsea led the second leg at Stamford Bridge 1–0, from the eighth minute until injury time, when Andrés Iniesta scored an equaliser in the 93rd minute {{from the edge of the}} penalty area, sending Barcelona through to the final on the away goals rule. On 13 May, Barcelona beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 to win the Copa del Rey for a record 25th time. Three days later, Real Madrid lost a league match and Barcelona was crowned La Liga champions for the 2008–09 season.|$|E

5|$|From 26 to 29 March, the division's 789th Regiment and the 143rd Rifle Brigade, with tank support, {{attacked}} the German strongpoint of Koy-Asan. The 789th advanced two kilometers, entered Koy-Asan, {{and opened fire}} on the railroad bridge. However, the Soviet troops were unable to completely take the strong point. On 31 March, Lvov ordered the army to transition to echeloned defense, and the 390th {{was placed in the}} rear echelon. Around this time, Zakian was mortally wounded by a shell fragment at his command post, and died on 2 April. Colonel Ivan Lyudnikov took command on 1 April, and seventeen days later was replaced by Colonel Hmayak Babayan. In late April the Chairman of the Presidium of the Armenian SSR Supreme Soviet, Matsak Papian, presented the division with a battle flag. Around <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>at</b> the insistence of the Crimean Front commissar Lev Mekhlis, all troops were concentrated into one single defensive line with few reserves.|$|E
5|$|In 604, another bishopric was founded, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> Rochester, where Justus was consecrated as bishop. The king of Essex was {{converted}} {{in the same}} year, allowing another see to be established at London, with Mellitus as bishop. Rædwald, {{the king of the}} East Angles, also {{was converted}}, but no see was established in his territory. Rædwald had been converted while visiting Æthelberht in Kent, but when he returned to his own court he worshiped pagan gods as well as the Christian god. Bede relates that Rædwald's backsliding was because of his still-pagan wife, but the historian S. D. Church sees political implications of overlordship behind the vacillation about conversion. When Augustine died in 604, Laurence, another missionary, succeeded him as archbishop.|$|E
5|$|In September 1919, Quisling {{departed}} Norway {{to become}} an intelligence officer with the Norwegian delegation in Helsinki, a post that combined diplomacy and politics. In the autumn of 1921, Quisling left Norway once again, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> the request of explorer and humanitarian Fridtjof Nansen, and in January 1922 arrived in the Ukrainian capital Kharkov {{to help with the}} League of Nations humanitarian relief effort there. Highlighting the massive mismanagement of the area and the death toll of approximately ten thousand a day, Quisling produced a report that attracted aid and demonstrated his administrative skills, as well as his dogged determination to get what he wanted. On 21August, he married the Russian Alexandra Andreevna ("Asja") Voronina, the daughter of a peddler. Alexandra wrote in her memoirs that Quisling declared his love for her, but based on his letters home and investigations undertaken by his cousins, it appears that there was never any question of romantic involvement between the two. Quisling merely seemed to have wanted to lift the girl out of poverty by providing her with a Norwegian passport and financial security.|$|E

5|$|In the quarter-finals, Alloa faced another away game, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> fellow Second Division club Ross County. George Shaw scored to give Ross County a 1–0 lead before half-time and Alloa {{equalised}} late in {{the second}} half through Mark Donaghy in the 82nd minute which made the score 1–1 to force extra time. Willie Irvine scored the winner for Alloa in the 113th minute to send the club through to the semi-finals. With the last four clubs left in the tournament, Alloa was drawn against local rival Stirling Albion with both clubs aiming to reach the first national cup final in their history. Stirling took the lead in the first half but were reduced to 10-men after Chris Wood was sent off in the 71st minute. Alloa replied with a goal from Scott Bannerman and then a penalty in the 80th minute from Willie Irvine to win 2–1 and reach the final.|$|E
5|$|Like the British Army, Australia did {{not have}} a {{parachute}} operations capability at the outbreak of the Second World War; however, the demonstration of the effectiveness of such forces by the Germans {{in the early stages of}} the conflict soon provided the impetus for their development. Efforts to raise an operational parachute capability in the Australian Army began in November 1942, with 40 volunteers being selected for initial training with the newly formed Paratroop Training Unit. The first descents were made at Tocumwal in New South Wales, with the initial parachute courses consisting of four jumps. By March 1943 enough personnel had been trained for the Army to consider forming a full parachute battalion. As a result, the 1st Parachute Battalion was raised at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> RAAF Station Richmond near Sydney, New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Missouri {{spent the}} next several years , with {{periodic}} reactivations for summer training cruises for midshipmen from the US Naval Academy. She was reduced temporarily to reserve status on 1 May 1910 in Boston, though she was recommissioned on 1 June 1911 for service with the Atlantic Fleet. In June 1912, the ship was deployed to Cuba with a contingent of Marines to protect American interests during a rebellion in the country. She conducted a midshipmen training cruise in July before being decommissioned a second time on 9 September, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> Philadelphia. She returned to service on 16 March 1914 for another midshipmen cruise, which visited Italy and Great Britain. On 2 December, she was again decommissioned before returning to service on 15 April 1915 for a midshipmen cruise in the Caribbean, through the Panama Canal, and to visit ports in California. After arriving back in Philadelphia, she was reduced to the Reserve Fleet yet again on 18 October. Another period of active service began on 2 May 1916 for a training cruise along the east coast of the United States and into the Caribbean, before Missouri was again laid up late in the year.|$|E

5|$|On 18 April 1944, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade {{was again}} activated, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> Guadalcanal, {{and placed in}} reserve for a time, {{commanded}} by Brigadier General Lemuel C. Shepherd. In July, it {{was moved to the}} Marshall Islands for a planned invasion of Guam, an island {{under the control of the}} Empire of Japan. This much larger brigade was built around the 4th and 22nd Marine Regiments with supporting units, and comprised 9,886 Marines. The brigade was assigned to III Amphibious Corps, a force almost 67,000 strong, in anticipation of a 15 July invasion of Guam's southern beaches, in conjunction with a northern landing by the Army's 4,500-man 305th Infantry Regiment, 77th Infantry Division. The brigade commenced training at Guadalcanal in conjunction with the 3rd Marine Division. Then, in early July, the two formations staged through the Eniwetok Atoll in preparation for the invasion.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November 1943, Brändle {{shot down}} two P-47 Thunderbolts fighters escorting a {{formation}} of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses {{on a mission}} targeting Wilhelmshaven. Later that day, {{he was killed in}} action west of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Following an attack by a group of Martin B-26 Marauders on Schiphol airfield, II. Gruppe scrambled to counter the attack. It is assumed that he was shot down in his Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-6 (Werknummer 26058—factory number) by Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) fighters under the command of Wing Commander Lloyd Chadburn. His body was later washed ashore near Zandvoort on 30 December 1943 and was buried at the Heroes Cemetery in Amsterdam (field 74, grave 405) one day later. His remains were moved in January 1944 before they were reinterred for a last time on 2 December 1947, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> the cemetery Ysselsteyn (block CW, row 1, grave 25).|$|E
5|$|On 5 June 1999 the 24th Infantry Division was reactivated, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> Fort Riley, Kansas.

The division headquarters {{was responsible for the}} Guard brigades should they be called to active duty in wartime. This never occurred, as each brigade deployed individually.
