5|$|In November 1970, Power and Saxe became <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>seventeenth</b> persons on the FBI's Most Wanted Fugitives list. At first, Power and Saxe {{traveled}} together, escaping arrest {{by hiding}} out in women’s communes. For part of this time, the two went to ground in Connecticut and Power assumed the name Mae Kelly. Saxe was able to elude arrest until 1975, when she was captured in Philadelphia. She then served five years in prison.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>seventeenth</b> centuries, {{the status}} of women amongst masons in Britain is likely to be similar to that codified in the minutes of the lodge at St. Mary's Chapel in Edinburgh. A burgess could pay for the Freedom to employ and {{instruct}} masons. The widow of a master mason could accept commissions from his old clients, provided that she employed a journeyman of the lodge to supervise the work.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Inns of Chancery {{was used as}} {{accommodation}} and offices by solicitors, the other branch of the English legal profession. During <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>seventeenth</b> centuries {{the purpose of the}} Inns changed. After the outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642, the practice of teaching barristers in the Inns ceased, and as a result the Inns of Chancery became a dedicated association for solicitors instead, offering offices and accommodation. The foundation of the Society of Gentlemen Practisers and Law Society of England and Wales in 1739 and 1825 respectively as professional bodies for the solicitors profession relegated the Inns of Chancery to little more than eccentric dining clubs, and they were gradually dissolved and sold. In 1897 a popular book reported that nobody could remember the purpose of the buildings and that an 1850 investigation had failed to uncover their origins. The last Inn to be sold was Clement's Inn, which was sold in 1903, and demolished in 1934.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} atheism re-emerged {{initially}} {{as a reaction}} to the intellectual and religious turmoil of the Age of Enlightenment and the Reformation, as a charge used by those who saw the denial of god and godlessness in the controversial positions being put forward by others.

Although one overtly atheistic compendium known as the Theophrastus redivivus was published by an anonymous author in the seventeenth century, atheism was an epithet implying a lack of moral restraint.|$|E
