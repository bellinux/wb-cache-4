5|$|In November 2011 it was {{announced}} that a new visitor centre, costing nearly £2 million, was to be built at the Leigh Woods end of the bridge to replace the <b>temporary</b> <b>building</b> currently being used. The new facilities were scheduled to be completed before the 150th anniversary of the opening, which was celebrated on 8 December 2014.

5|$|By early 1997, {{after almost}} two decades of activity, the only repairs {{completed}} were phase one of the air ventilation system to dehumidify the hollow base, the drainage pipes and a new inner roof. Plans now included the erection of a temporary two-story metal building to protect all but the giant Father Time from the harsh winters and to facilitate year-round repair; the reinforcement of corroded steel interior portions; the replacement of inconsistent patches; the substitution of engineered spacing for natural cracks, and finally, hand-brushed concrete recoating. The <b>temporary</b> <b>building</b> was budgeted at $270,000; the city spent a total of $450,000 on repairs approved by the Park District that year.|$|E
25|$|These {{regulations}} also {{applied to}} <b>temporary</b> <b>buildings</b> associated with construction work.

50|$|The {{building}} that housed CLC {{was constructed in}} 1925. The building originally was Johnston Junior High School. When Johnston moved to Meyerland in September 1959, Miller Junior High School opened in Johnston's former location. CLC began in 1973 as the Continuous Progress Learning and Development Center, a high school program for {{students who did not}} perform well in traditional academic environments. It was a pilot project of the Emergency School Aid Act (ESAA). It originally used two rooms at Miller before several <b>temporary</b> <b>buildings</b> were moved to the school. The CLC high school stayed in the <b>temporary</b> <b>buildings</b> until 1976. When the high school vacated the <b>temporary</b> <b>buildings,</b> the CLC middle school moved into the <b>temporary</b> <b>buildings.</b> In 1980 the middle school moved to the third floor.|$|R
5|$|Radstock {{was one of}} the {{missions}} established in 1913 by the Downside community. A <b>temporary</b> <b>building</b> of thin wooden beams and asbestos blocks was erected in 1913, and dedicated to St Hugh. Its altar rails and benches came from Prior Park. Dom Mackey was succeeded in 1918 by Dom Ambrose Agius, who acquired a disused printing works, formerly a barn and converted it into the present church in Westfield, which opened in 1929. It was rebuilt after a serious fire in 1991. It has a statue of the patron on its façade.|$|E
5|$|The {{hearing was}} held at a <b>temporary</b> <b>building</b> near the Washington Monument housing offices of the AEC. It began on April 12, 1954, and lasted four weeks. The AEC was {{represented}} by Roger Robb, an experienced prosecutor in Washington, and Arthur Rolander, while Oppenheimer's legal team was headed by Lloyd K. Garrison, a prominent New York attorney. The chairman of the Personnel Security Board was Gordon Gray, president of the University of North Carolina. The {{other members of the}} hearing panel were Thomas Alfred Morgan, a retired industrialist, and Ward V. Evans, chairman of the chemistry department at Northwestern University.|$|E
5|$|This church {{replaced}} a <b>temporary</b> <b>building</b> {{which stood}} on the site from 1854, and was built with money and on land donated by William Petre, 12th Baron Petre, who was from a prominent Catholic family; he was also responsible for other churches in Essex at Barking, Ongar, Brentwood and Chelmsford. Of relatively modest size and in a then rural location, St Edward’s was amongst the first 19th century churches built in Essex under the Catholic Diocese of Westminster, established in 1850. The church was dedicated in May 1856 by Nicholas Wiseman, the first Archbishop of Westminster, and designed by the London-based architect Daniel Cubitt Nichols.|$|E

5|$|Edward I gave wide-reaching {{powers to}} the sheriff of Yorkshire for {{enforcing}} {{law and order in}} the city of York, and the sheriffs established their headquarters in Clifford's Tower. During the wars against the Scots under both Edward and his son, York Castle also formed the centre of royal administration in England for almost half the years between 1298 and 1338. Many Westminster institutions followed the king north to York, basing themselves in the castle compound. The existing castle buildings were insufficient to house all the administrative institutions; a <b>temporary</b> <b>building</b> inside the castle was built for the Court of Common Pleas {{at the beginning of the}} period, and rebuilt on a larger scale during 1319–20. The Exchequer took over Clifford's Tower. Other buildings around the city had to be commandeered to absorb the overflow from the castle itself. As a result of the extended use of the castle for these purposes, the law courts at York Castle began to compete with those in London, a pattern that lasted into the 1360s. The castle eventually acquired its own mint in 1344, when Edward III decided to create a permanent mint in York Castle to produce gold and silver coins to serve the needs of the north of England. European coiners were brought to York to establish the facility.|$|E
