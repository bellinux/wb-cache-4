When July 1970 came and went, Close must have thought he was safe. However, Close offended the Lancashire president, the Honourable Lionel Lister, when Lister entered the away captain's changing room to speak to Close after Lancashire, Yorkshire's archrivals, had beaten them at Old Trafford to retain the one-day John Player League trophy. Close, who may not have known who Lister was, offered Lister some choice words. Lister immediately told Brian Sellers, the chairman of the Yorkshire cricket committee, of the insult.|$|E
500|$|After {{her book}} was published, Brodie was {{contacted}} by some Eston Hemings Jefferson descendants who recognized {{his name from}} her account. They discovered that their fathers in the 1940s had decided that, to protect their children from racial discrimination associated with descent from Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> the children they were descended from Jefferson's uncle. All these Jefferson descendants learned in the 1970s of their alleged descent from Eston Hemings, Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson. Brodie wrote a follow-up article about the Jefferson-Hemings grandchildren in 1976, entitled [...] "Thomas Jefferson’s Unknown Grandchildren: A Study in Historical Silences"], published in October 1976 in American Heritage magazine. Photographs and other documentary material they gave her have been donated to UCLA archives.|$|E

He {{considered}} it his first experience in writing a feature film. He explained, [...] "I would sit with Pete [...] and David Silverman and we would talk about a scene and <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> me what they were looking for. I would make some suggestions and then go off and write the sequence. We'd get together again and review it and then hand it off to a story artist. Here's where the collaborative process really kicked in. The board artist was not beholden to my work and could take liberties here and there. Sometimes, I would suggest an idea about making the joke work better visually. Once the scene moved on to animation, the animators would plus the material even further." ...|$|E

2500|$|Missionary work means {{deploying}} undercover operatives {{to create}} dissent on the picket lines and in union halls, for example, by utilizing whispering campaigns or unfounded rumors. Missionaries frequently directed their whispering campaigns toward strikers' families and communities. For example, female operatives would visit {{the wives of}} strikers in their homes, incorporating their cover story into their spiel. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> the wife sad stories about how their own spouse lost a job years ago because of a strike, and hasn't found work since, and [...] "that's why I must sell these products door to door." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{someone asks}} a Muslim scholar about {{performing}} a specific action, the reply {{will be a}} fatwa explaining which of these five categories this action would fall under. So if you ask a Muslim scholar to give a fatwa about adultery, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> {{you that it is}} [...] "Not Permitted". If you ask about fasting in Ramadan, they would answer that it is [...] "Obligatory". Muslims are usually encouraged to ask for reasoning and evidence behind any fatwa, and should avoid blindly following the opinions of Muslim scholars without understanding the reasons behind them. This is because Muslims should always feel that they are practicing Islam to gain the pleasure of God, and not to gain the pleasure of acceptance of any human being.|$|E

5000|$|A simpler {{solution}} is to ask either man if <b>they</b> themselves <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> you that their path leads to freedom.

The Observer reported: [...] "He went to Pakistan in June 2001 because, he says, he had a drug problem and wanted to kick the habit.

If a man {{assaulted}} his neighbor's wife and caused a miscarriage, the judges would tell the husband to give his wife to the neighbor so that the neighbor might make her pregnant. If a person cut off the ear of a neighbor's donkey, they would order the owner {{to give it to}} the offender until the ear grew again. If a person wounded a neighbor, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> the victim to pay the offender a fee for bleeding the victim. A person who crossed over with the ferry had to pay four zuzim, but the person who crossed through the water had to pay eight.|$|E

[...] "When I answered yes, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> me that they wouldn't be sitting there today if it weren't for the Holloway Plan....It had put them through collegeschools like Princeton, Duke University, Caltech, and Stanford.

[...] He also looked down on women, writing {{that as soon as}} they began to disagree with each other <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> tales about party activities, and might go as far as denouncing their comrades to the police. In July 1885 Engels wrote to Guillaume-Schack [...] "it is my conviction that real equality of women and men can come true only when the exploitation of either by capital has been abolished and private housework has been transformed into a public industry.|$|E

He said the Hanban regularly rejected such proposals [...] "too far outside the official CI ambit (which <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> us was mainly 'cultural')," [...] "A lot of what the Hanban wanted us to do didn’t make sense given our institution, faculty population, and student population," [...] said Professor Hayot, who was not involved in the CI contract negotiations this summer.
