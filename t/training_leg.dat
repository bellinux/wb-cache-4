Studies that have investigated possible correlations between stretching and muscular performance are scarce and inconclusive in the literature. Thus, {{the purpose of the present}} study was to examine the effect of long-term (24 weeks) stretching exercise on muscle contractile properties. Method: Eighteen subjects (five men and thirteen women; 21. 82 ± 1. 74 yrs, 71. 80 ± 11. 65 kg, 1. 77 ± 5. 56 m) volunteered to participate in this study. The <b>training</b> <b>leg</b> was randomly drawn and unilateral static stretching exercises (SS) were applied every day for twenty-four weeks. The SS protocol consisted of four repetitions of stretch, each lasting for one minute with a sixty second rest in between, aiming to increase the passive range of motion (ROM) in ankle dorsiflexion. The testing protocol consisted of measurements pre- and post-intervention in passive ROM, passive resistance torque (PRT), isometric maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) (10 ˚, 0 ˚, - 5 ˚ and - 10 ˚), isokinetic peak torque (PT) and angle at PT (30, 45, 60 and 90 ˚/sec). Results: The ROM significantly increased pre- to post-test for the <b>training</b> <b>leg</b> by 10. 42 ˚ (58. 42 %) (P> 0. 05). For the PRT test a significant difference was found only at the angle of - 10 ˚ between pre- to post-test for the <b>training</b> <b>leg</b> (P> 0. 05). No significant changes were observed for isometric MVC, isokinetic PT and angle at PT pre- to post-test or between groups (P> 0. 05). For the control leg no significant differences were found. Discussion: These results suggest that the present long-term stretching intervention was effective in increasing passive ROM. Despite this highly significant change in passive ROM, no changes were seen in muscle-contractile properties.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether 16 weeks of resistance training (RT) can reduce the blood pressure response and improve the cardiovascular function of men aged 70 - 80 years during submaximum aerobic exercise. Methods: Twenty-four men aged between 70 and 80 years were randomly assigned to an RT group (n = 12) and control group (n = 12). Training consisted of three sets of six to 10 repetitions at 70 - 90 % of one repetition maximum, three times per week, on an incline squat machine for 16 weeks. Blood pressure and cardiovascular function were assessed during submaximum cycle exercise at 40 W, and 50 and 70 % of maximum oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) before training and after 16 weeks of <b>training.</b> <b>Leg</b> strength and VO 2 max were assessed every 4 weeks of the 16 -week study. Results: At 40 W, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and rate pressure product were lower and stroke volume was significantly higher after 16 weeks of training. At 50 % VO 2 max, heart rate and rate pressure product were lower after 16 weeks of training and at 70 % VO 2 max, cycle ergometry power, VO 2, and arterio-venous oxygen difference were higher after 16 weeks of <b>training.</b> <b>Leg</b> strength significantly increased after 16 weeks of training. Conclusion: Sixteen weeks of RT significantly reduces the blood pressure response and improves the cardiovascular function of older men during submaximum aerobic exercise.

40|$|Purpose: Patients {{with chronic}} heart failure (CHF) {{typically}} complain about skeletal muscle fatigue. In rat experiments, reduced intracellular calcium release {{seems to be}} related to fatigue development in normal skeletal muscle but not in muscle from rats with CHF. We therefore hypothesize that training may not improve intracellular calcium cycling to the same extent in muscles from patients with CHF compared with healthy controls (HC). Methods: Thirteen HC and 11 CHF patients performed 6 wk of unilateral knee extensor endurance training. Computed tomographic examinations of the thigh and biopsies of vastus lateralis were obtained bilaterally before and after the training period. Results: Peak power of the <b>trained</b> <b>leg</b> was 10 % and 14 % greater than that in the untrained leg in HC and CHF, respectively. For the HC, training resulted in a higher Ca 2 + release rate and a lower leak in the <b>trained</b> <b>leg</b> associated with a tendency of increased ryanodine receptor (RyR) content with reduced phosphorylation level. In the <b>trained</b> <b>leg</b> of CHF patients, RyR content was reduced without associated changes of either Ca 2 + leak or release rate.

40|$|Resistance {{exercise}} {{has been}} suggested to increase blood volume, increase {{the sensitivity of the}} carotid baroreceptor cardiac reflex response (BARO), and decrease leg compliance, all factors that are expected to improve orthostatic tolerance. To further test these hypotheses, cardiovascular responses to standing and to pre-syncopal limited lower body negative pressure (LBNP) were measured in two groups of sedentary men before and after a 12 -week period of either exercise (n = 10) or no exercise (control, n = 9). Resistance exercise training consisted of nine isotonic exercises, four sets of each, 3 days per week, stressing all major muscle groups. After exercise <b>training,</b> <b>leg</b> muscle volumes increased (P < 0. 05) by 4 - 14 %, lean body mass increased (P = 0. 00) by 2. 0 (0. 5) kg, leg compliance and BARO were not significantly altered, and the maximal LBNP tolerated without pre-syncope was not significantly different. Supine resting heart rate was reduced (P = 0. 03) without attenuating the heart rate or blood pressure responses during the stand test or LBNP. Also, blood volume (125 I and 51 Cr) and red cell mass were increased (P < 0. 02) by 2. 8 % and 3. 9 %, respectively. These findings indicate that intense resistance exercise increases blood volume but does not consistently improve orthostatic tolerance...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} if 16 weeks of strength training {{can improve the}} cardiovascular function of older men during submaximum aerobic exercise. Methods: Twenty four men aged 70 - 80 yr {{were randomly assigned to}} a strength training (ST; n = 12) and control group (C; n = 12). Training consisted of 3 sets of 6 - 10 repetitions at 70 % to 90 % of 1 RM, 3 times per week, on an incline squat machine for 16 weeks, followed by 4 weeks detraining. Leg strength and maximum oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) were assessed every 4 weeks of the 20 -week study.

40|$|Endurance {{exercise}} training induces mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. The peroxisome proliferator activated receptor co-activator 1 α (PGC- 1 α) {{has recently}} {{been identified as a}} nuclear factor critical for coordinating the activation of genes required for mitochondrial biogenesis in cell culture and rodent skeletal muscle. To determine whether PGC- 1 α transcription is regulated by acute exercise and exercise training in human skeletal muscle, seven male subjects performed 4 weeks of one-legged knee extensor exercise training. At the end of training, subjects completed 3 h of two-legged knee extensor exercise. Biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle of both the untrained and <b>trained</b> <b>legs</b> before exercise and after 0, 2, 6 and 24 h of recovery. Time to exhaustion (2 min maximum resistance), as well as hexokinase II (HKII), citrate synthase and 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase mRNA, were higher in the trained than the untrained leg prior to exercise. Exercise induced a marked transient increase (P 40 -fold) and mRNA content (7 - to 10 -fold), peaking within 2 h after exercise. Activation of PGC- 1 α was greater in the <b>trained</b> <b>leg</b> despite the lower relative workload. Interestingly, exercise did not affect nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF- 1) mRNA, a gene induced by PGC- 1 α in cell culture. HKII, mitochondrial transcription factor A, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α, and calcineurin Aα and Aβ mRNA were elevated (≈ 2 - to 6 -fold; P < 0. 05) at 6 h of recovery in the untrained leg but did not change in the <b>trained</b> <b>leg.</b> The present data demonstrate that exercise induces a dramatic transient increase in PGC- 1 α transcription and mRNA content in human skeletal muscle. Consistent with its role as a transcriptional coactivator, these findings suggest that PGC- 1 α may coordinate the activation of metabolic genes in human muscle in response to exercise...|$|R

40|$|The {{randomized}} controlled trial ‘Physical Activity in Pediatric Cancer’ (PAPEC) determined {{the effects of}} an in-hospital exercise intervention combining aerobic and muscle strength training on pediatric cancer patients with solid tumors undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods. Participants were allocated to an exercise (n= 24, 17 boys; mean±SEM age 10 ± 1 y) or control group (n= 25, 18 boys; 11 ± 1 y). Training included three sessions/week for 19 ± 2 weeks. Participants were assessed at treatment initiation, termination, and two months after end-treatment. The primary endpoint was muscle strength (as assessed by upper and lower-body five-repetition-maximum (5 RM) tests). Secondary endpoints included cardiorespiratory fitness, functional capacity during daily life activities, physical activity, body mass and body mass index, and quality of life. Results. Most sessions were performed in the hospital’s gymnasium. Adherence to the program averaged 68 ± 4 % and no major adverse events or health issues were noted. A significant interaction (group*time) effect was found for all 5 RM tests. Performance significantly increased after <b>training</b> (<b>leg</b> press: 40 % (95 % CI= 15 – 41 kg); bench press: 24 % (95 % CI= 6 – 14 kg); lateral row 25 % (95 %CI= 6 – 15 kg)), whereas an opposite trend was found in controls.

40|$|Regaining muscle {{strength}} {{is an essential}} part of rehabilitation post-stroke. This study aimed to demonstrate that maximal strength training (MST) improves {{muscle strength}}, which transfers into improvements in functional measures and quality of life, but not maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 peak), amongst chronic stroke survivors. 12 patients acted as their own controls for 4 weeks, prior to 8 weeks training. Patients trained 4 sets of 4 repetitions at 85 - 95 % one repetition maximum (1 RM) in leg press and plantarflexion, 3 days/week. Strength was measured by leg press and plantarflexion 1 RM. Secondary outcomes included walking economy (Cw), 6 minute walk test (6 MWT), timed up and go (TUG) and four step square test (FSST). Quality of life was assessed by the Medical Outcomes Survey short form 36 -item questionnaire (SF- 36). There were no significant changes in any parameters during the control period except VO 2 peak, which was attributed to a learning effect. After <b>training,</b> <b>leg</b> press 1 RM improved by 30. 2 kg (72. 4 %) and 17. 9 kg (82. 9 %), and plantarflexion 1 RM by 36. 6 kg (96. 1 %) and 27. 7 kg (239 %) for the unaffected and affected limbs respectively (all p< 0. 01). 6 MWT improved by 18. 6 m (p< 0. 01) and TUG by 0. 7 seconds (p< 0. 05). There were no significant changes in Cw, VO 2 peak, FSST or SF- 36 after training. The lack of improvement in Cw may be because the imbalance between limbs limits hemiplegic gait more than muscle strength per se. The results show that chronic stroke patients not only tolerate but in fact benefit from MST, as it generates large increases in strength and improvements in functional measures. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: There is {{increasing}} evidence that exercise induced increases in BP measured during sub-maximum aerobic exercise {{can be used}} to predict death from cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes independent of resting blood pressure. Therefore a reduction in the BP response during sub-maximum aerobic exercise may possibly reduce the risk of a future cardiovascular incident. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if 16 weeks of strength training can reduce the blood pressure response and improve the cardiovascular function of men aged 70 – 80 yr during sub-maximum aerobic exercise. Methods: Twenty four men aged 70 – 80 yr were randomly assigned to a strength training (ST; n = 12) and Control group (C; n = 12). Training consisted of three sets of 6 – 10 repetitions at 70 to 90 % of 1 RM, 3 times per week, on an incline squat machine for 16 weeks. Blood pressure and cardiovascular function were assessed during sub-maximum cycle exercise at 40 Watts, 50 % and 70 % ofVO 2 max before training and after 16 weeks <b>training.</b> <b>Leg</b> strength and maximum oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) were assessed every 4 weeks of the 16 -week study. Results: At 40 W, heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and rate pressure product (RPP) were lower and stroke volume (SV) significantly higher after 16 weeks training: at 50 % VO 2 max, SBP, HR and RPP were lower after 16 weeks training: at 70 % VO 2 max, cycle ergometry power, VO 2 and arterio-venous oxygen difference (a-vO 2) were higher after 16 weeks training. SBP did not significantly change despite an increase in cycle ergometry power. Leg strength and VO 2 max increased after 16 weeks training. Conclusion: Sixteen weeks of strength training significantly reduces the blood pressure response and improves the cardiovascular function of older men during submaximum aerobic exercise. Therefore strength training not only increases muscular strength and hypertrophy but also provides significant cardiovascular benefits for older individuals...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} how neural mechanisms operate during maximum strength training in the Quadriceps Femoris muscle group. One of the main objectives is to investigate the effects of five weeks unilateral maximum eccentric strength training on contralateral neural adaptations. The second is to investigate the effects of adding electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback into the training intervention.   Method: 20 healthy, recreationally active men and women had to undergo five weeks (three training sessions per week, resulting in 15 sessions in total) of maximum isokinetic unilateral eccentric strength training of the Quadriceps femoris muscle, with EMG biofeedback; FBG, n= 10 five women and five men, or without EMG biofeedback; RTG n= 10 five women and five men. The study was performed at the Laboratory of Biomechanics and Motor control, BMC Laboratory, Stockholm Sweden. Results: The results demonstrated an increase in concentric strength development in the trained leg; before 130 ± 43 Nm and after training 148 ± 46 Nm, (p= 0. 006). No significant increase in strength was detected for the untrained leg. Further, post hoc tests showed a tendency towards an increase in level of activation (LOA) of the <b>trained</b> <b>leg</b> in the FBG; from 69 ± 15 % before to 81 ± 13 % after training (p= 0. 097). No significant differences in the ecc:con EMG-ratio or in antagonist co-activation after the training intervention were shown. Conclusion: No significant difference in strength development was shown, whether training occurred with or without EMG biofeedback. However, eccentric training tended to induce transfer of neural activation to a maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) in the <b>trained</b> <b>leg</b> only in the group training with EMG biofeedback. In addition, the results revealed that eccentric strength training improved concentric strength in the <b>trained</b> <b>leg</b> but induced no transfer to the contralateral untrained leg. The benefits and prospects with incorporating feedback into training remains somewhat unknown and requires further research to obtain deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms affected by biofeedback...|$|R

40|$|Although {{handgrip}} {{strength is}} considered a strong predictor of negative health outcomes, {{it is unclear whether}} handgrip strength represents a useful measure to evaluate changes in muscle strength following resistance-type exercise training in older people. We assessed whether measuring handgrip strength provides proper insight in the efficacy of resistance-type exercise training to increase muscle mass, strength, and physical performance in frail older people. Methods: Prefrail and frail older people (≥ 65 y) were either conducting a 24 -week resistance-type exercise training or no exercise training. Before, during, and after the intervention, handgrip strength (JAMAR), lean body mass (DXA), leg strength (1 -RM), and physical performance (SPPB) were assessed. Results: Handgrip strength correlated with appendicular lean mass (r = 0. 68; p 3 ̆c. 001) and leg strength (r = 0. 67; p 3 ̆c. 001). After 24 weeks of whole body resistance-type exercise <b>training,</b> <b>leg</b> extension strength improved significantly better when compared with the control group (57 ± 2 – 78 ± 3 kg vs 57 ± 3 – 65 ± 3 kg: p 3 ̆c. 001). Moreover, physical performance improved significantly more in the exercise group (8. 0 ± 0. 4 – 9. 3 ± 0. 4 points) when compared with the control group (8. 3 ± 0. 4 – 8. 9 ± 0. 4 points: p 3 ̆c. 05). These positive changes were not accompanied with any significant changes in handgrip strength (26. 3 ± 1. 2 – 27. 6 ± 1. 2 kg in the exercise group vs 26. 6 ± 1. 2 – 26. 3 ± 1. 3 kg in the control group: p =. 71). Conclusion: Although handgrip strength strongly correlates with muscle mass and leg strength in frail older people, handgrip strength does not provide a valid means to evaluate the efficacy of exercise intervention programs to increase muscle mass or strength in an older population...|$|E
40|$|HEMODYNAMIC RESPONSES TO VIBRATION IN HUMAN CALF MUSCLE Zange, J. 1; Illbruck, A. 1, 2; Molitor, S. 1; Kohl-Bareis, M. 2; Rittweger, J. 1 1 : DLR, Institute of Aerospace Medicine, (Cologne, Germany); 2 : University of Applied Technology Koblenz, Rhein-Ahr-Campus (Remagen, Germany) Introduction During {{whole body}} {{vibration}} <b>training</b> <b>leg</b> muscles moderately increase their energy turn-over (Zange et al. 2009) and absorb {{part of the}} kinetic energy by conversion into heat (Cochrane et al. 2008). This entails the need for appropriate blood supply. The present study focuses on the hemodynamic response to passive vibration in terms of blood content and blood oxygenation in the unloaded calf muscle exploring the relative contribution of the arterial and the venous compartment. The hypothesis was that venous restriction would prevail over arterial vasodilatation. Methods The subjects (n= 12, male) {{sat in front of}} a vibration platform with their bare right foot affixed to the platform. The test included 2 intervals of 3 min vibration at either 15 Hz or 25 Hz (permutated order, ± 2. 5 mm amplitude), followed by 3 min recovery. Near infra-red spectroscopy (Geraskin, 2009) was used for measuring hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SmO 2 in %) and the concentrations of oxygenated, desoxygenated, and total hemoglobin (HbO 2, HbH, tHb) in the m. gastrocnemius medialis. EMG was recorded for the detection of reflex responses. Results Within the first 30 s of vibration SmO 2 increased from 56 ± 7 % to 68 ± 4 %. After having reached this maximum, SmO 2 slowly decreased until it reached a steady state at 63 ± 5 % after almost 1. 5 min of vibration. In the recovery phase SmO 2 linearly decreased back to base line. No significant differences were found for frequency and the order of vibration intervals. The initial increase of SmO 2 corresponded to a large decrease in HbH, a small increase in HbO 2, and a decrease in tHb. The EMG was super-imposed by artefacts at the vibration frequency and its harmonics and did not reveal any evidence of muscular activity. Furthermore, there was no evidence for a reflex contraction by visual observation or subjects’ sensation. Discussion These observations suggest that in the unloaded calf muscle 15 and 25 Hz vibration initially cause a mechanical removal of predominantly desoxygenated blood from the capillaries and venules. Afterwards a moderate mismatch between oxygen supply and consumption was indicated by the decrease in SmO 2 followed by a steady state indicating a balance. After vibration full recovery was reached within 3 min without indications of a reactive hyperemia. Of note, all these very clear changes occurred in the absence of EMG activity. The responsible mechanisms could e. g. be related to vasomotor responses or to basic muscle tone and need to be established by further studies.

40|$|Objectives: Exercise with {{partially}} restricted {{blood flow}} is a low-load, low-intensity resistance training regimen {{which may have}} the potential to increase muscle strength in the obese, elderly and frail who are unable to do high-load training. Restricted blood flow exercise has also been shown to affect blood vessel function variably and can, therefore, contribute to blood vessel dysfunction. This pilot study tests the hypothesis that unilateral resistance <b>training</b> of the <b>leg</b> extensors with partially restricted blood flow increases muscle strength and decreases vascular autoregulation. Methods: The subjects were nine normotensive, overweight, young adult African-Americans with low cardiorespiratory fitness who underwent unilateral training of the quadriceps’ femoris muscles with partially restricted blood flow at 30 % of the 1 -repetition maximum (1 -RM) load for 3 weeks. The 1 -RM load and post-occlusion blood flow to the lower leg (calf) were measured during reactive hyperemia. Results: The 1 -RM load increased in the <b>trained</b> <b>legs</b> from 77 ± 3 to 84 ± 4 kg (P 0. 1). Post-occlusion blood flow decreased significantly in the <b>trained</b> <b>legs</b> from 19 ± 2 to 13 ± 2 mL· min- 1 · dL- 1 (P < 0. 05) and marginally in the contralateral untrained legs from 18 ± 2 to 16 ± 1 mL· min- 1 · dL- 1 (P = 0. 09). Changes in post-occlusion blood flow to the skin overlying the trained and the contralateral untrained muscles were not significant. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that restricted blood flow exercise, which results in significant gains in muscle strength, may produce decrements in endothelial dysfunction and vascular autoregulation. Future studies should determine whether pharmacopuncture plays a role in treatments for such blood vessel dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|Exercise {{training}} {{is known to}} increase intramuscular triglyceride content in both <b>trained</b> and untrained <b>legs.</b> The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine the changes of intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) and extramyocellular lipids (EMCL) of both <b>trained</b> and untrained <b>legs</b> during detraining. We measured both IMCL and EMCL levels in previously <b>trained</b> versus untrained <b>legs</b> during 4 -weeks of detraining after 6 -weeks of strength training. Eight young men (aged 21. 4 +/- 1. 4 years) trained their vastus lateralis muscle in one leg using a dynamometer, whereas the contralateral leg served as untrained control. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), IMCL, EMCL, total creatine (creatine+phophocreatine) of extensor (vastus lateralis) muscles were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectra (1 H-MRS) before training, 3 days after and 28 days after the last bout of training. CSA was increased in both legs by Day 3 after training, and was still high at Day 28 post-training; IMCL increased in both legs by Day 3 after training, then decreased at Day 28 post-training only in the untrained leg; EMCL shows no significant change by Day 3 after training, but at Day 28 post-training has increased in the <b>trained</b> <b>leg</b> and decreased in the untrained leg; total creatine did not change significantly. Conclusion: Decreases of IMCL and EMCL storages in previously untrained leg during detraining indicates an ectopic influence on tissue lipid storage by different metabolic demand among tissues in the same human body...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} a period of passive {{movement}} training on angiogenic factors and capillarization in skeletal muscle was examined. Seven young males were subjected to passive training for 90 min, four times per week in a motor-driven knee extensor device that extended one knee passively at 80 cycles min− 1. The other leg was used as control. Muscle biopsies were obtained from m. v. lateralis of both legs before as well as after 2 and 4 weeks of training. After the training period, passive movement and active exercise were performed with both legs, and muscle interstitial fluid was sampled from microdialysis probes in the thigh. After 2 weeks of training there was a 2 -fold higher level of Ki- 67 positive cells, co-localized with endothelial cells, in the passively <b>trained</b> <b>leg</b> which was paralleled {{by an increase in}} the number of capillaries around a fibre (P < 0. 05). Capillary density was higher than pre-training at 4 weeks of training (P < 0. 05). The training induced an increase in the mRNA level of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), the angiopoietin receptor Tie- 2 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 9 in the passively <b>trained</b> <b>leg</b> and MMP- 2 and tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP) - 1 mRNA were elevated in both legs. Acute passive movement increased (P < 0. 05) muscle interstitial vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels 4 - to 6 -fold above rest and the proliferative effect, determined in vitro, of the muscle interstitial fluid ∼ 16 -fold compared to perfusate. The magnitude of increase was similar for active exercise. The results demonstrate that a period of passive movement promotes endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenic factors and initiates capillarization in skeletal muscle...|$|R
