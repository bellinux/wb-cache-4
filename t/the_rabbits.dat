He is {{characterized}} by his frequent impatience, guttural accent and unusual phrasing. After discovering the Efrafa warren and helping <b>the</b> <b>rabbits,</b> he rejoins his colony, but promises to visit. According to Adams, Kehaar {{was based on a}} fighter from the Norwegian Resistance in World War II.|$|E

5|$|Potter's weariness with {{depicting}} rabbits {{is reflected}} in the book's pictures. Of the twenty-six illustrations, eight depict Mr. McGregor and seventeen the garden and its structures. There are almost no close-ups of <b>the</b> <b>rabbits</b> and none with the detail found in Benjamin Bunny. When <b>the</b> <b>rabbits</b> are depicted, they are viewed in the middle distance in order to include all six as well as the garden background. They are depicted with little or no facial expression. It is likely Potter (a farm owner at the date of the book's composition) had come to view rabbits as undifferentiated pests rather than individual personalities. Several drawings for the illustrations for The Flopsy Bunnies were given to the British Museum in 1946.|$|E

30|$|We {{consider}} a game played by two players: the hunter and <b>the</b> <b>rabbit.</b> This game is described using a graph G(V,E) where V {{is a set}} of vertices and E {{is a set of}} edges. Both players may use a randomized strategy. The hunter can move from vertex to vertex along edges. <b>The</b> <b>rabbit</b> can move to any vertex at once. The hunter’s purpose is to catch <b>the</b> <b>rabbit</b> in as few steps as possible. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>rabbit</b> considers a strategy that maximizes the time until the hunter catch <b>the</b> <b>rabbit.</b> If <b>the</b> hunter moves to a vertex that <b>the</b> <b>rabbit</b> is at, <b>the</b> game finishes and we say that the hunter catches <b>the</b> <b>rabbit.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although Watership Down is a {{peaceful}} habitat, Hazel realizes {{there are no}} does (female rabbits), thus making {{the future of the}} warren certain to end with the inevitable death of <b>the</b> <b>rabbits</b> present. With the help of their useful new friend, a black-headed gull named Kehaar, they locate a nearby warren called Efrafa, which is overcrowded and has many does. Hazel sends a small embassy, led by Holly, to Efrafa to present their request for does.|$|E

Though Hazel {{is not particularly}} large or powerful, he is loyal, brave, and a quick thinker. He sees the good in each individual, and what they bring to the table; in so doing, he makes sure that no one gets left behind, thus earning the respect and loyalty of his warren. He often relies on Fiver's advice, and trusts in his brother's instincts immensely.|$|E
5|$|Large {{animals that}} {{frequent}} the park include elk, deer, cougar, and pronghorn. Beaver, otter, mink, and raccoons {{are found in}} or near the river. Coyotes, bats, and badgers are among the park's other mammals. Predators hunt smaller animals such as <b>the</b> <b>rabbits,</b> voles, mice, and shrews found in the park's grasslands and sagebrush-covered hills. Bushy-tailed woodrats inhabit caves and crevices in the monument's rock formations. Bighorn sheep, wiped out in this region in the early 20thcentury, were reintroduced in the Foree Area of the Sheep Rock Unit in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{critical}} commentary varies. One critic {{points out}} that the faces of <b>the</b> <b>rabbits</b> are expressionless while another argues that the cock of an ear or the position of a tail conveys what the faces lack. One critic believes the tale lacks the vitality of The Tale of Peter Rabbit which sprang from a picture and story letter to a child. Most agree though that the depictions of the garden are exquisite and some of the finest illustrations Potter created.|$|E

5|$|Watership Down is {{a fantasy}} {{adventure}} novel by English author Richard Adams, published by Rex Collings Ltd of London in 1972. Set in southern England, the story features {{a small group}} of rabbits. Although they live in their natural environment, they are anthropomorphised, possessing their own culture, language, proverbs, poetry, and mythology. Evoking epic themes, the novel follows <b>the</b> <b>rabbits</b> as they escape the destruction of their warren and seek a place to establish a new home, encountering perils and temptations along the way.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin finds {{and brings}} his cousin Peter Rabbit into the rescue venture, {{and the two}} {{discover}} Tommy has invaded one of Mr. Tod's homes. Mr. Tod, a fox, has multiple homes but keeps moving. Often Tommy lodges in his homes. Peeping through the bedroom window, <b>the</b> <b>rabbits</b> see Tommy asleep in Mr. Tod's bed, and, peeping through the kitchen window, they see the table set for a meal. They realise the bunnies are alive, but shut in the oven. They try to dig a tunnel into the house but hide when Mr. Tod suddenly arrives in a very bad temper, which has caused him to move house.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its small}} size, the least weasel is a fierce hunter, capable {{of killing a}} rabbit five to ten times its own weight. Although they are {{commonly}} taken, <b>the</b> <b>rabbits</b> are usually young specimens, and become an important food source during the spring, when small rodents are scarce and rabbit kits are plentiful. Male least weasels take {{a higher proportion of}} rabbits than females, as well as an overall greater variety of prey. This is linked to the fact that being larger, and having vaster territorial ranges than females, males have more opportunities to hunt a greater diversity of prey.|$|E

At first Hazel's group are {{relieved}} to finally {{be able to sleep}} and feed well – all except for Fiver who senses only death there. When Bigwig is nearly killed in a snare, the group realize that the new warren is managed by a farmer who protects and feeds <b>the</b> <b>rabbits,</b> but also harvests a number of them for their meat and skins. The residents of the new warren are simply using Hazel and the others to increase their own odds of survival. Fiver {{and the rest of the}} group work together to rescue Bigwig from a snare, then continue on their journey, along with a rabbit from the new warren called Strawberry, who asks to join them after his doe is killed in a snare.|$|E
5|$|The fox {{discovers the}} badger {{asleep in his}} bed, and {{originally}} plans to hit him, but decides against this due to the Badger's teeth. He decides to play a trick upon him involving a pail of water balanced on the overhead tester of the bed. Brock however is awake, escapes the trick, and makes tea for himself in the kitchen. Mr. Tod thinks the bucket has killed Tommy and decides to bury him in the tunnel <b>the</b> <b>rabbits</b> have dug, thinking Tommy dug it. When Mr. Tod discovers Tommy in the Kitchen and has tea thrown over him, a violent fight erupts that continues outdoors. The two roll away down the hill still fighting. Benjamin and Peter quickly gather the bunnies, and return home in triumph.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medieval}} or post-medieval period, {{the remains of}} the hillfort were used as a rabbit warren which was used to breed rabbits, {{providing}} valuable meat and fur. Many warrens were surrounded by banks or walls to prevent <b>the</b> <b>rabbits</b> from escaping; escaped rabbits caused damage to nearby farmland and meant a loss in profit. The warren at Dolebury is completely enclosed by the substantial ramparts of the Iron Age hill fort and thus provided an ideal location to breed rabbits. The presence of pillow mounds and vermin traps demonstrate man's management of the site for husbandry. Ridge and furrow agriculture has also been identified, from aerial photographs, within the fort. Some of these structures, along with earlier Iron Age features, have been damaged by subsequent quarrying which may have been for lead, ochre or calamine. The site was described by John Leland in the 16th century. A three-storey building, believed to be the warrener's house and possibly a watch tower, surrounded by a garden, was in ruins by 1830.|$|E

5|$|Lundy {{is home to}} {{an unusual}} range of mammals, almost all introduced, {{including}} a distinct breed of wild pony, the Lundy pony. Until recently, Lundy and the Shiant Isles in the Hebrides {{were the only two}} places in the UK where the black rat (Rattus rattus) could be found regularly. In the rest of the United Kingdom they have largely been replaced by brown rats except for occasional sightings in port towns and the Thames Estuary. It has since been eradicated on the island, {{in order to protect the}} nesting seabirds. Other species which have made the island their home include the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus), Sika deer (Cervus nippon), pygmy shrew (Sorex minutus) and feral goats (Capra aegagrus hircus). Unusually, 20% of <b>the</b> <b>rabbits</b> (Leporidae) on the island are melanistic compared with 4% which is typical in the UK. In mid-2006 the rabbit population was devastated by myxomatosis, leaving only 60 pairs from the previous 15–20,000 individuals. Soay sheep (Ovis aries) on the island have been shown to vary their behaviours according to nutritional requirements, the distribution of food and the risk of predation.|$|E
5|$|Suggested {{conservation}} {{work for}} the future includes habitat restoration and predator population control. A healthy balance of mature and young forests still exists on {{the southern end of}} Amami, so that area should be protected. Restricting logging would also help to keep more forest available for <b>the</b> <b>rabbits</b> to live in by leaving more forest standing, as well as disturbing the surrounding environment more. An end to the building of forest roads used for logging and travel would further protect the amami rabbit, as they cause population and habitat fragmentation, destroys their prime habitat and allows predators easier access to the middle of forests where a majority of the rabbit population exists. Controlling the populations of mongooses, feral dogs, and feral cats is another approach that could help bolster the rabbit population. Eradication of the mongooses and feral cats and dogs is needed, as well as better control of pets by local island residents.|$|E
5|$|The 2007–08 season {{started with}} a further {{reduction}} in teams. Harbin and Qiqihar combined into a single team and became {{owned and operated by}} the San Jose Sharks. They took the name of their new owner and became the China Sharks. Kangwon Land renamed to High1. With only seven teams, the league reduced the number of games played to its lowest at just 30 games. The league continued with an unbalanced schedule and the Korean and Chinese teams played each other more than the Japanese teams did. After three years of dominance, the Nippon Paper Cranes slipped to fourth place and the regular season was won by the Prince Rabbits. Alex Kim, playing for High1, recorded the most goals with 23 and most points with 51. Joel Prpic continued to find himself on top of the pack with 30 assists. With six of seven teams going to the playoffs, the Sharks were the only team that didn't find themselves in a playoff spot. The first round was over quickly as the Cranes swept Halla in three games and Oji did the same to the Ice Bucks. Nippon faced their rivals, <b>the</b> <b>Rabbits,</b> in the second round and defeated them three to one. High1 couldn't repeat their success from the previous year by winning a series and were swept by Oji in three games. For the first time, the final series was not between the Cranes and Rabbits. Oji continued to roll over their opponents and swept the Cranes, marking the only time a team in Asia League had swept its way through three rounds. Due to their dominance on the ice, the point race was also swept by Oji. Takeshi Saito led the playoffs with nine assists and 15 points, while Shane Endicott had the most goals with 6. Kunihiko Sakurai, also from Oji, won the MVP of the Year and Eum Hyun-seung, from High1, won the Young Guy of the Year award.|$|E
