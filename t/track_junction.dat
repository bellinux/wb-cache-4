5|$|After {{crossing}} the Kumusi, the 16th Brigade {{was ordered to}} move towards Sanananda Point to support the joint Australian–US effort to attack the Japanese beachheads around the Buna–Gona area. The ration situation had grown worse by this time, and progress was slow as the march proved too difficult {{for many of the}} soldiers in their weakened physical states. Nevertheless, by 18 November, the 2/2nd Infantry Battalion had led the brigade into Popondetta, after which the 2/3rd moved into the vanguard. For the next two days they experienced almost no opposition until 21 November when Japanese artillery began to target the 2/1st. Launching a quick attack with three companies, the 2/1st outflanked the Japanese gun pit with two companies while the third provided support-by-fire. In the rout that followed over 80 Japanese were killed. By nightfall, the 2/1st, which had dug-in and subsequently fought off a number of Japanese counterattacks, was relieved from the forward position just a few kilometres from the coast. The brigade had been severely depleted in reaching the position and at that point had only 1,040 fit men, so they were ordered to hold their position along the front to provide cover to troops of the US 126th Infantry Regiment, which was slowly moving towards the Soputa–Sanananda–Cape Killerton <b>track</b> <b>junction.</b> On 23 November, the 16th Brigade finally received artillery support, after a battery from the 2/1st Field Regiment was flown into the hastily established airfield at Popondetta and began firing upon Sananada. The inexperienced American regiment made very slow progress and as a result, the 16th Brigade held their position until 6 December, when they were progressively relieved by troops from the 30th Brigade, having suffered over 85 per cent casualties. The 2/3rd Infantry Battalion was the last out, being withdrawn on the night of 19/20 December.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{defensive}} {{positions at}} Buna, Gona and {{forward at the}} Sanananda <b>track</b> <b>junction</b> had been strongly developed {{before the arrival of}} Allied forces. They have been described as some of the strongest encountered by the Allies {{in the course of the}} war. They made excellent use of terrain, which limited the tactical possibilities for attackers and consisted of hundreds of bunkers and machine gun emplacements developed in depth. Individual positions were mutually supporting and alternative positions were used to confound attackers.|$|E
25|$|During this landing, the {{squadron}} came ashore {{in the first}} wave of the assault force and was instrumental in establishing the beach head. Once the rest of Farida Force had landed, {{the squadron}} began patrolling operations along the coast to the west towards the town of Mandi. The patrol was carried out without contacting the Japanese, however, later, as they moved further west past Mandi, they came upon two stragglers. The next day, 'B' Troop's positions west of Mandi were mortared by the Japanese, and after a brief period of suppression fire from the beachhead, the troop attacked, taking the <b>track</b> <b>junction</b> and exploiting further westwards.|$|E
50|$|Three-quarter {{unions are}} similar to grand unions {{in that they are}} also rail <b>track</b> <b>junctions</b> where two {{double-track}} railway lines cross at grade, often in a street intersection or crossroads; the primary difference being that one corner of the crossing does not have curved <b>junction</b> <b>tracks,</b> with the union having a total of twelve railroad switches (sets of points).|$|R
2500|$|The {{biggest change}} {{came with the}} {{introduction}} of block-signalling in 1876. [...] Signal cabins (the NER name) were erected at Mill Lane, Hungate, Bridge Street, High Mill and Newbridge. [...] Later as the branches to Scarborough and Helmsley were opened, small signal cabins on the branches were opened to control the single to double <b>track</b> <b>junctions,</b> these were Eastgate and Goslip Bridge. [...] Of these seven cabins only Newbridge survives today.|$|R

25|$|Attached to the 24th Brigade, the {{majority}} of the 2/11th Commando Squadron landed at Labuan Island on 10 June 1945, while a troop was detached to clear Hamilton Point, crossing Victoria Harbour and landing at Hardy's Beach in LVTs. Originally it had been intended to send the entire squadron to clear the peninsula, however, intelligence gathered from locals earlier indicated that there were no Japanese there and as such the decision was made only to send one troop from the squadron to making the landing across the harbour. After landing, the troop met no opposition and began to move north along the Charlie Track towards the main arterial that ran east-west across the island known as Hamilton Road, where at the <b>track</b> <b>junction,</b> on 12 June they linked up with the 2/43rd Battalion.|$|E
500|$|East of Northern Boulevard, {{where there}} would be a <b>track</b> <b>junction</b> with the Queens Boulevard Line, the 63rd Street–Southeast Queens line would become a [...] "super-express" [...] bypass of the Queens Boulevard line. This bypass, which was {{proposed}} due to the overall congestion of the line during peak hours, was originally a single [...] "high speed express track", with no intermediate stops, in order to allow trains to travel at speeds of up to [...] The bypass would have used one of the two trackways parallel to, and surrounding, the four-track LIRR Main Line; the trackways, formerly used by the Rockaway Beach Branch, are currently unused. It would stretch from the 63rd Street Line east of 21st Street–Queensbridge near the Sunnyside Yard, with the possibility of access to the 60th Street and 53rd Street Tunnels. At its east end, it would have left the LIRR right-of-way near Whitepot Junction and ran under Yellowstone Boulevard to the Queens Boulevard Line near 71st Avenue station. The 71st Avenue station would have been converted into a bi-level or tri-level station, with the super express tracks using the lower level(s) built south of the current station, before rejoining the main line Queens Boulevard tracks. Later plans called for two tracks and an intermediate stop next to the current Woodside LIRR station; there would have also been a three-track station along the 63rd Street Line at Northern Boulevard, adjacent to the existing Queens Plaza station. The bypass and proposed Woodside station would have necessitated the widening of the LIRR Main Line right-of-way onto private property west of Winfield Junction, where the Main Line merges with the Port Washington Branch, and reorganization of the track layout in the Sunnyside Yards. The IND Queens Boulevard Line was to be reverse-signaled as well to further increase capacity.|$|E
500|$|Isurava {{sits in a}} {{clearing}} on the first main peak of the Owen Stanleys on the southern route from Kokoda as the track rises towards its highest peak at Mount Bellamy. It is positioned {{to the south of}} Deniki and the north of Alola on a north–south ridgeline. A rest house was positioned about [...] to the south, {{with a view of the}} Eora Valley. To its east, the high ground falls steeply towards the fast-flowing Eora Creek which sits at the bottom of a deep ravine. Isurava lay on a spur that jagged west from the Isurava ridgeline towards Eora Creek, and was bounded to the north and south by two small tributaries that cut the track. To the west of Eora Creek on the other side of the steep ravine, opposite Isurava, was the village of Missima. It lay on the slope that rose towards the Abuari ridgeline, sitting astride a smaller parallel track that joined the main Kokoda Track after passing through Abuari and crossing Eora Creek via a log bridge near Alola. Overlooked by a ridge to the north, Isurava was ultimately unsuited to defensive operations. The ridge to its north offered the Japanese artillery, of which at that stage of the campaign they had a significant advantage, the ability to range their fire down on the Australian position. The track to the east of Eora Creek and the <b>track</b> <b>junction</b> around Alola offered the Japanese an easy avenue of advance around the flank towards the Australian rear. Nevertheless, it was chosen over the Isurava rest house position further south when the area was reconnoitred in mid-August by Major Allan Cameron, the brigade major of the 30th Infantry Brigade and temporary commander of the 39th Infantry Battalion.|$|E
25|$|The New York City Subway system has, for {{the most}} part, used block {{signalling}} since its 1904 opening. , the system consists of about 14,850 signal blocks, 3,538 mainline switches, 183 major <b>track</b> <b>junctions,</b> 10,104 automatic train stops, and 339,191 signal relays.

One patch was [...] immediately forward of the Japanese positions encountered by the 2/1st Battalion on 20 November. After long fighting along the Kokoda Track, the effective strength of the Brigade had been reduced to less than the equivalent of a battalion. The American III/126th Battalion (with two companies of the 1st Battalion) was bought forward on 22 November to make a similar left flank manoeuvre to Catterns'.

The same day in AO Moose, B and D Companies from the South Vietnamese 11th Airborne Battalion had also contacted a large Viet Cong force at 13:00, estimated to include at least two platoons armed with AK-47s and RPK light machine-guns. The fighting continued until last light and resulted in heavy ARVN casualties which included six killed and six wounded. Communist casualties were unknown.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the eastern}} end, the Japanese {{occupied}} the Duropa Plantation, from the New Strip, blocking the approach by the coastal route. They also blocked the approach from Simemi, with positions {{forward of the}} bridge. At {{the western end of}} the Buna area, a track led from Buna village and the Buna Government Station inland to Ango. The position that {{came to be known as}} the Triangle was a salient protruding from the Japanese defensive line. It straddled the track just inland of where the track branched to either the village or station. The Government Station is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the Buna Mission. Entrance Creek separated the Station from the village. On the track to the village, a foot bridge crossed Entrance Creek a short distance from the <b>track</b> <b>junction.</b> The [...] "Coconut Grove" [...] lay along the track to Buna Village, after crossing Entrance Creek.
