We first model <b>the</b> choice of <b>loan</b> <b>currency</b> in a framework which features a trade-off between lower cost of debt {{and the risk of}} firm-level distress costs, and also examines the impact of information asymmetry between banks and firms.

We then test the implications of our model by using a 2005 survey with responses from 9, 655 firms in 26 transition countries. The survey contains details on 3, 105 recent bank <b>loans.</b> At <b>the</b> firm level, our findings suggest that firms with foreign currency income and assets are more likely to borrow in a foreign currency. In contrast, firm-level distress costs and financial transparency affect the <b>currency</b> <b>denomination</b> only weakly. At the country level, the interest rate advantages of foreign currency funds and the exchange rate volatility do not explain the foreign currency borrowing in our sample. However, foreign bank presence, weak corporate governance and the absence of capital controls encourage foreign currency borrowing. All in all, we cannot confirm that "carry-trade behavior" is the key driver of foreign currency borrowing by small firms in transition economies. Our results do, however, support the conjecture that banking-sector structures and institutions that aggravate information asymmetries may facilitate foreign currency borrowing. foreign currency borrowing, competition, banking sector, market structure...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} demand and supply {{determinants}} of loan contract terms in small business lending. Chapter 2 presents results on loan maturity {{and is based}} on a cross-sectional dataset of German small business loans. I find a very robust positive and monotonic relation between risk and maturity. In the case of high asymmetric information this may be explained by theories on signaling. So, good borrowers choose short maturities to signal their good quality to the bank and to separate themselves from the bad borrowers. In the case of low asymmetric information this may be explained by relationship lenders assisting borrowers who experience financial difficulties by granting them longer maturities to ease their repayment pressure. Chapters 3 and 4 of the thesis explicitly use information from loan applications as well as loan contracts of loans made to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) by one Bulgarian bank between 2003 and 2007. Chapter 3 studies the determinants of <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> <b>currency.</b> Concerning <b>the</b> demand side, I find that firms are more likely to request EUR if they need larger, long-term or mortgage loans. My results also indicate that this is driven by firms’ anticipation that the bank is reluctant to grant such <b>loans</b> in local <b>currency.</b> On the supply side I find that the bank is more likely to switch <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> <b>currency</b> to EUR when it has more refinancing in EUR and especially when it has more EUR deposits. These findings imply that, in a country like Bulgaria, it will be most important to establish a stable and credible macroeconomic environment so that depositors are willing to save and banks to lend long-term in local currency. Another topic that has received much attention from academics as well as policy makers is credit rationing, but empirically there still remain questions on how big the actual extent of credit rationing is and how it evolves over bank relationships. In contrast to previous studies, I employ a more direct indicator of the actual extent of credit rationing, namely the ratio of granted to requested loan amounts, in chapter 4. My results indicate that credit rationing is considerable, especially in the beginning of bank relationships and for the more opaque borrowers. Moreover, the degree of credit rationing decreases over bank-borrower relationships and this decrease is indeed due to the bank’s willingness to increase its lending stakes over time. These results imply that efforts to create institutions which reduce informational asymmetries seem to be important in increasing small firms’ access to finance. Chapter 5 specifically looks at the effects of the 2007 - 2009 financial crisis on credit availability for MSMEs in Azerbaijan. The bank {{at the heart of this}} study experienced unexpected refinancing delays allowing me to examine an exogenous supply shock. At the same time, Azerbaijan’s economy is weakly diversified and highly oil dependent making it vulnerable to the economic crisis in the aftermath of the Lehman failure. The analysis reveals that the refinancing problems seem to impact on all loan types such as agro, micro and SME <b>loans</b> as <b>the</b> bank discourages new loan applications and grants fewer <b>loans.</b> <b>The</b> impact of the Lehman failure has more differential effects on <b>the</b> various <b>loan</b> groups: Agro loans are not affected, whereas the likelihood to be approved a loan application decreases considerably for SME loans. But especially for SME borrowers bank relationships seem to be important in mitigating these effects...|$|R

40|$|Most of <b>the</b> {{international}} <b>loans</b> {{by commercial}} banks are denominated {{in the home}} currency of the lending bank or a transaction currency like the US dollar. The focus of this dissertation is to provide an explanation for this empirical observation {{and to develop a}} model to determine whether or when an optimal currency choice may exist for the bank^ A model is developed to analyze the choice of currency in contracting international loans by commercial banks, where given the size of <b>the</b> <b>loan,</b> <b>the</b> bank chooses the rate of interest and the proportion of <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> to be denominated in its home currency. The bank maximizes the home <b>currency</b> value of <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> subject to a profit condition and a no-default condition by the borrower. The analysis is carried out for conditions of certainty as well as uncertainty and distinction is made between borrowers which are sovereign countries and individual firms borrowing internationally. ^ A major result obtained is that no unique optimum <b>currency</b> <b>denomination</b> exists for the bank. If, however, the expectation of exchange rate movement is asymmetric, then a particular currency is preferred to another. Also in the presence of institutional ceilings on the interest rate and moral hazard problems, home <b>currency</b> <b>denomination</b> of <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> is optimal for the bank. If the bank is risk averse, home <b>currency</b> <b>denomination</b> is preferred. ^ In the case of an involuntary default caused by temporary shortfall of the earnings of the borrower, a lending rule is derived for the bank which indicates that relending to the borrower {{is in the interest of}} the bank if <b>the</b> new <b>loan</b> and <b>the</b> accumulated arrears on past loans do not exceed the borrower 2 ̆ 7 s penalty from a default. If <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> repayment exceeds <b>the</b> penalty amount, the excess debt, it is concluded, must be forgiven. ...|$|R
40|$|Foreign <b>currency</b> <b>loans</b> to <b>the</b> unhedged non-banking sector {{are remarkably}} {{prevalent}} in Europe {{and create a}} significant exchange-rate-induced credit risk to European banking sectors. In particular, Swiss franc (CHF) -denominated loans, popular in Eastern European countries, could trigger simultaneous bank failures if depreciation of the domestic currencies prevents borrowers from servicing <b>the</b> <b>loans.</b> Foreign <b>currency</b> <b>loans</b> thus pose a systemic risk from a "common market shock" perspective. The author uses a novel dataset of foreign-currency loans from 17 countries for 2007 - 11 (collected by the Swiss National Bank) and builds on the method suggested by Ranciere, Tornell, and Vamvakidis (2010) to quantify this systemic risk.

However, CHF-denominated <b>loans</b> are not <b>the</b> underlying source of the high systemic risk: Loans denominated in other foreign currencies (probably {{to a large extent}} in euros) contribute significantly more to the systemic risk in the non-euro area than CHF-denominated loans.
