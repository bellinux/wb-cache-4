Health issues included dehydration, sickness, and gastrointestinal problems.

40|$|A {{total of}} 460 water samples were {{randomly}} drawn from <b>the</b> potable <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> sources of rural communities in three counties of South Carolina. About 10 % of the population, not incorporated in municipalities, was sampled. The samples were tested for total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and fecal streptococci.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplying</b> {{power of}} soil to crop roots {{depends on its}} {{physical}} properties. These properties are described by the hydraulic conductivity-matric potential-moisture content relationships. Without dynamic analysis of soil water movement，it is difficult to predict intuitively {{the effects of these}} physical properties on crops. In this study, 3 indices were defined: hydraulic conductivity index (K^^-), water retentivity index (Θ) and responsivity index (K^^-/Θ) of soil. Using these indices, the effect of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplying</b> power of soil on soil water movement and crown potential of crop were estimated. It is proved by numerical analysis that these indices are useful in estimating intuitively <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplying</b> power of soil to crops. 作物の生育に土壌水分が大きな影響を与えることは良く知られている. 土壌の成層状態,地下水位などの水理学的土壌条件,根系分布,群落構造などの作物条件及び気象条件が一定であれば,土壌が作物の根に水分を供給する能力は主として土壌の保水性と透水性に依存する. この保水性と透水性は一般には不飽和透水係数-マトリックポテンシャル-土壌水分量の相互関係によって表される. しかし,これらの相互関係についてのデータのみから,土嘆の保水性と透水性の特徴を把握し,作物生育に与える影響を予想することは,土壌水分動態のシミュレーションをおこなわないかぎり困難である. 本研究では,土壌の保水性と透水性が作物生育に果たす役割を直覚的に評価するために,土壌の保水性,透水性及び応答性を表す簡単な指標を定義した. これらの指標を用いることによって,土壌が作物に水分を供給する能力を推測できることを数値実験の手法を用いて明らかにした...|$|R

5|$|Both {{subspecies}} of South Asian {{river dolphins}} {{have been very}} adversely affected by human use of the river systems in the subcontinent. Irrigation has lowered water levels throughout both subspecies' ranges. Poisoning of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have also contributed to population decline. Perhaps the most significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which the dolphins can breed. Currently, three subpopulations of Indus river dolphins are considered capable of long-term survival if protected.|$|E

40|$|Transactions of AIJ. Journal of {{environmental}} engineeringIn {{order to the}} evaluate heat loss from hot <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> lines in a residential building, hot water demand {{in a house in}} Chiba prefecture was measured and analyzed. The following results were obtained. 1. The heat loss of <b>the</b> hot <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> line was about 132 kJ for the shower and 110 kJ for the bathtub in winter. Since the temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of <b>the</b> hot <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> line is small, the measured heat loss from <b>the</b> hot <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> line sometimes becomes negative. 2. In order to estimate the heat loss under various conditions, a thermal model was proposed. 3. The calculated daily heat loss of <b>the</b> hot <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> line was 122 kJ for the shower and 689 kJ for the bathtub in winter. The average daily heat loss from <b>the</b> hot <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> line during use and after use was 1774. 7 KJ in winter. This heat loss amounts to 4. 7 % of the total daily energy use for hot <b>water</b> <b>supply.</b> 4. For reducing the heat loss, thermal insulation of <b>the</b> hot <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> line and <b>the</b> use of thinner pipes are effective...|$|R
