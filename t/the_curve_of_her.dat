25|$|The austere {{portrait}} in his normally constrained palette is another Whistler exercise in tonal harmony and composition. The deceptively simple design {{is in fact}} a balancing act of differing shapes, particularly the rectangles of curtain, picture on the wall, and floor which stabilize <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face, dress, and chair. Again, although his mother is the subject, Whistler commented that the narrative was of little importance. In reality, however, it was an homage to his pious mother. After the initial shock of her moving in with her son, she aided him considerably by stabilizing his behavior somewhat, tending to his domestic needs, and providing an aura of conservative respectability that helped win over patrons.|$|E
60|$|She smiled very slightly, but <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips was delightful.|$|E
60|$|Joan's {{eyes were}} bright with battle, <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips sharp with mockery.|$|E
60|$|Matters {{lingered on}} thus. And then, as a hoop by gentle knocks {{on this side}} and on that is made to travel in {{specific}} directions, the little touches of circumstance {{in the life of}} this young girl shaped <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> career.|$|R
60|$|Phases <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{childhood}} lurked in her aspect still. As {{she walked}} along to-day, {{for all her}} bouncing handsome womanliness, you could sometimes see her twelfth year in her cheeks, or her ninth sparkling from her eyes; and even her fifth would flit over <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth now and then.|$|R
60|$|Dick was relieved, but not voluble; {{he could}} only admiringly follow <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> pretty arms and hands, clasped lightly in her lap, down {{to the point of}} the little slipper. But even that charming {{vanishing}} point was presently withdrawn--possibly through some instinct--for the young lady had apparently not raised her eyes.|$|R
60|$|He {{laid her}} card and letter on the twill {{bedspread}} near <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> knees.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked up}} at her then, sidelong. <b>The</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cheek and chin looked very soft, and rather jolly.|$|E
60|$|He {{had come}} back from the window, and was {{standing}} close to her, who, in <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> grand piano, was, as it were, embayed.|$|E
60|$|Roger did {{not feel}} {{as if he wanted}} to talk about the Ideal. He noticed how vivid Freda's smile was and how lovable were <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck where <b>the</b> dusky curls were caught up from it. He had also an inner vision of Freda making taffy with Tim and he did not approve of it.|$|R
60|$|He {{was silent}} for some moments. <b>The</b> faint <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips had again given him almost a shock.|$|R
5000|$|Venus is {{considered}} to be the embodiment of feminine beauty and form, and these traits are shown in the painting. Her head is tilted to one side, and her facial expression reflects that she is calm and comfortable with her nudity. She raises her arms, arranging her thigh-length, brown hair, swaying elegantly in an [...] "S" [...] <b>curve</b> contrapposto, emphasizing <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him over her shoulder, and he noticed with a twinge of delight how her little chin came out beneath <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cheek.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! You do!" [...] He {{had come}} back from the window, and was {{standing}} close to her, who, in <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> grand piano, was, as it were, embayed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, John, {{so strong}} and strange a tilter must {{fight for the}} {{brightness}} of his lady's eyes or <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyelash, even as Sir Nigel does for the Lady Loring." ...|$|E
60|$|They rowed that evening; {{the next}} came, {{and with it}} the {{necessity}} of rowing again. Then the next, and the next, Cytherea always sitting in the stern with the tiller ropes in <b>her</b> hand. <b>The</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> figure welded with those of the fragile boat in perfect continuation, as she girlishly yielded herself to its heaving and sinking, seeming to form with it an organic whole.|$|R
60|$|Lovely indeed was {{the face}} {{looking out at}} me from its border of {{tarnished}} gilt. It was {{the face of a}} young girl, in shape a perfect oval, with delicate features and large dark-blue eyes. Her hair, caught high on the crown and falling on her neck in the long curls of a bygone fashion, was a warm auburn, and <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bare neck and shoulders were exquisite.|$|R
60|$|When Annie {{returned}} it, she met {{the younger}} sister, whom she found a great beauty. She seemed very cold, and of a hauteur which she subdued with difficulty; but she was more consecutively polite than her sister, and Annie watched with fascination <b>her</b> turns <b>of</b> the head, <b>her</b> movements <b>of</b> leopard swiftness and elasticity, the changing lights <b>of</b> <b>her</b> complexion, <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fine lips, <b>the</b> fluttering <b>of</b> <b>her</b> thin nostrils.|$|R
60|$|Heyst {{stretched}} out his hands and looked at them for a moment, then let them fall by his side. Indignation was expressed more in <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips than in her clear eyes, which never wavered.|$|E
60|$|Tallente for {{a moment}} was almost at a loss. Then a glance into her really very {{wonderful}} eyes, and <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips as she smiled convinced him of the truth which he had at first discarded.|$|E
60|$|The fair girl, who had overheard, leaned across. The {{shade of}} newly awakened {{interest}} in her face, and <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips as she spoke, added to her charm. A gleam of sunlight flashed upon the yellow-gold of her plainly coiled hair.|$|E
60|$|She came. I don't {{think the}} French window ever held a finer view than {{when she put}} aside the curtains, and stepped out. She had dressed herself simply and hurriedly, but with a woman's {{knowledge}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> best points; so that you got <b>the</b> long <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> shapely limbs, <b>the</b> shorter <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> round waist and shoulders, the long sweep <b>of</b> <b>her</b> yellow braids, the light <b>of</b> <b>her</b> gray eyes, and even the delicate rose <b>of</b> <b>her</b> complexion, without knowing how it was delivered to you.|$|R
60|$|The {{scene was}} {{the hall of}} Capulet's house, and Romeo in his pilgrim's dress had entered with Mercutio and his other friends. The band, such as it was, struck up a few bars of music, and the dance began. Through the crowd of ungainly, shabbily-dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a {{creature}} from a finer world. Her body swayed, while she danced, as a plant sways in <b>the</b> water. <b>The</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> throat were <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> a white lily. Her hands seemed {{to be made of}} cool ivory.|$|R
60|$|Millicent bent her head, and {{her eyes}} were misty. A raw wound, which the frost had irritated, marred <b>the</b> {{delicate}} <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> upper lip. It became painfully visible.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{my mother}} then," [...] said John. [...] "She was at much pains at my upbringing, and, by my soul! I will uphold <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyelashes, for it tickleth my very heart-root to think of her. But who is here?" ...|$|E
60|$|The Princess {{looked at}} her {{stepdaughter}} critically. Jeanne was dressed in white, with a great red rose stuck through her waistband. She was paler even than usual, her eyes were dark and luminous, and <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> scarlet lips suggested readily enough the weariness of which she spoke.|$|E
60|$|Tallente made no reply. He was {{standing}} on the hearth rug, {{a few feet away from}} her, watching as she stirred her milk, watching <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body, the grace of her long, smoothly shining arms. And beyond these things he strove to read what was at the back of her mind.|$|E
60|$|They {{had both}} stopped. He {{was still holding}} her {{sleeping}} hand. His arm had stolen around the burnous so softly that it followed <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> figure as lightly as a fold of the garment, and was presumably unfelt. Grief has its privileges, and suffering exonerates a questionable situation. In another moment her fair head MIGHT have dropped upon his shoulder. But an approaching voice uprose in the adjoining broad allee. It {{might have been the}} world speaking through the voice of the lawyer Sanderson.|$|R
6000|$|She stared {{blankly at}} him, {{and it was}} clear that it was all as {{if it had not been}} with her. He insisted, and then she said: [...] "Perhaps I thought I knew him, and was afraid I should hurt his {{feelings}} if I didn't recognize him. But I don't remember it at all." [...] <b>The</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth drooped, and her eyes grieved, so that her father had not the heart to say more. She left them, and when he was alone with Lanfear he said: ...|$|R
60|$|The warning did {{not seem}} {{justified}} {{in view of the}} attractive table--candles, cut glass, a mound of flowers on a beveled mirror, silvery linen, and grape-fruit with champagne. Carl was at one side of Aunt Emma, but she seemed more interested in Mr. Winslow, {{at the end of the}} table; and on his other side Carl had a safe companion in Olive Dunleavy. Across from him were Florence Crewden, Phil, and Ruth--Ruth shimmering in a gown of yellow satin, which broke <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fine, flushed shoulders only by a narrow band.|$|R
60|$|All {{through the}} service Ben sat {{where he could}} see Grace by turning his head, {{but he had not}} the courage to do so. Once or twice he caught a glimpse of <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cheek and the {{delicate}} lines of her ear, and a suffocating throb came into his throat.|$|E
60|$|She {{had thrown}} {{herself at the}} bottom of the wagon, with her back towards him and her doll in her lap. He could see <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> curly head, and beyond, her bare dimpled knees, which were raised, and over which she was trying to fold the hem of her brief skirt.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned and}} looked into her face. Underneath her {{beautiful}} eyes were dark lines; there was something pitiful about <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth. He remembered that although she had carried herself throughout the evening with all the dignity which was second nature to her, he had overheard more than one sympathetic comment upon her appearance.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mistress Thankful, with a {{smile that}} began in the corners <b>of</b> <b>her</b> brown eyes, ran down into <b>the</b> dimpled <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth, and finally ended in the sudden revelation <b>of</b> <b>her</b> white teeth,--"no, not alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not mean}} him to wait long enough for that {{needlework}} to be finished," [...] she said, lifting her hands to stroke <b>the</b> backward <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hair, while she rose from her seat and stood still.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. 162" [...] {{waits for}} us in Slip E of the topmost stage. <b>The</b> great <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> back shines frostily under the lights, and some minute {{alteration}} <b>of</b> trim makes <b>her</b> rock a little in her holding-down slips.|$|R
