5|$|An epigraphic {{reference}} {{ascribed to}} Garulaka Simhaditya, {{the son of}} Varahdas, the king of Dwarka, is inscribed on a copper plate dated to 574AD, found in Palitana. The Greek writer of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea referred <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> called Baraca, which has been interpreted as present-day Dwarka. A reference made in Ptolemy's Geography identified Barake as {{an island in the}} Gulf of Kanthils, which has also been inferred to mean Dwarka.|$|E
5|$|Around {{this central}} motif are {{arranged}} elements of eight other stories, {{all of them}} represented {{at least in part}} by sets of footprints. Human footprints include a set left by dancing women from a place called Aileron; another shows a family group travelling <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> called Ngama, and a third trail is that of a Tjungurrayi man, which lead to his skeleton, representing his death after committing the crime of trying to steal sacred items. Animal representations include tracks of a cluster of emus from a place called Napperby, on the artist's country, as well as those left by the rock wallaby, or Mala, men journeying north from Port Augusta in South Australia, as well as, on the left hand edge of the picture, those of two groups of dingoes going <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> called Warrabri. A little closer to the centre of the painting are marks representing a dreaming called the Chase of the Goanna Men. Throughout the work, Upambura the Possum Man's footsteps follow the wandering lines that give the painting its overall structure.|$|E

Following the breakup of the circle, Parker traveled to Hollywood to pursue screenwriting.

5|$|In 756, Emperor Xuanzong {{was forced}} to flee the capital and abdicate. Du Fu, who had been away from the city, took his family <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of safety and {{attempted}} to join the court of the new emperor (Suzong), but he was captured by the rebels and taken to Chang'an. In the autumn, his youngest son, Du Zongwu (Baby Bear), was born. Around this time Du Fu {{is thought to have}} contracted malaria.|$|E

5|$|Mangalore's {{historical}} {{importance is}} {{highlighted by the}} many references to the city by foreign travellers. During the first century CE, Pliny the Elder, a Roman historian, made references <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> called Nitrias, as a very undesirable place for disembarkation, {{on account of the}} pirates which frequent its vicinity, while Greek historian Ptolemy in the second century CE referred <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> called Nitra. Ptolemy's and Pliny the Elder's references were probably made to the Netravati River, which flows through Mangalore. Cosmas Indicopleustes, a Greek monk, in his 6th century work Christian Topography mentions Malabar as the chief seat of the pepper trade, and Mangarouth (port of Mangalore) as one of the five pepper marts which exported pepper.|$|E

5|$|As with A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan is a bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, {{this time}} from the {{perspective}} of a female character, Tenar. Though she nominally has a position of high authority, Tenar feels trapped by her duties as priestess, and desires to escape <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where she can make her own choices. In contrast to Ged, whose journey was chiefly a private quest, Tenar's choices have direct social consequences. While Ged's growth is traced through the various adventures he experiences in the first volume of the series, Tenar's development is shown through her exploration of her own domain. The labyrinth, in particular, with its twists and turns, is a metaphor for Tenar's exploration of her own thoughts. In this reading of the novel, the labyrinth symbolizes the imprisonment of the women, and the darkness and unacknowledged thoughts within Tenar, which she begins to struggle through after feeling guilt over killing the prisoners sent to her.|$|E

The blue vapors fill the room and reveal that they are the remains of the Gelth, a once-corporeal alien race until they were devastated by the Time War. They plead with the Doctor to open the rift that exists {{in the basement of the}} parlour and allow them to cross over. The Doctor offers the Gelth temporary use of the corpses until he can transport them <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where they can build new bodies, using Gwyneth as a bridge to cross the Rift.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the grand Roman villa was being {{excavated}} at Durley Hill Cemetery, a second smaller villa was discovered during the construction of Fry's Somerdale Chocolate Factory. Two fine stone coffins were found, interred with the remains of a man and a woman. The villa and coffins were removed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> near the gates of the factory grounds, and construction on the factory went ahead. Fry's built in the grounds of the factory a museum which for many years housed the Durley Hill mosaics, the coffins, and numerous other artefacts. In 2012, Taylor Wimpey, about to develop the factory site, made a detailed geophysical assessment of the area, and discovered an additional 15 Roman buildings centered around a Roman road beneath Keynsham Hams, with evidence of additional Roman buildings that had been disturbed by quarrying.|$|E

5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note.
