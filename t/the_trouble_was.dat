5|$|The root of <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>was</b> an {{economic}} crisis—initiated by the Panic of 1837—which was entering its sixth year in 1842. A speculative bubble had burst in 1836–39, causing {{a collapse of}} the financial sector and a subsequent depression. The country became deeply divided over the best response to the crisis. Conditions got even worse in early 1842 because a deadline was looming. A decade earlier, when the economy was strong, Congress had promised Southern states {{that there would be}} a reduction in hated federal tariffs. Northern states welcomed tariffs, which protected their infant industries. But the South had no industrial base and depended on open access to British markets for their cotton. In a recommendation to Congress, Tyler lamented that it would be necessary to override the Compromise Tariff of 1833 and raise rates beyond the 20 percent limit. Under the previous deal, this would suspend the distribution program, with all revenues going to the federal government.|$|E

500|$|During {{the winter}} months of May–August the {{scientists}} were busy in their laboratories, while elsewhere equipment and stores were prepared for the next season's work. For relaxation there were amateur theatricals, and educational activities {{in the form of}} lectures. A newspaper, the South Polar Times, was edited by Shackleton. Outside pursuits did not cease altogether; there was football on the ice, and the schedule of magnetic and meteorological observations was maintained. As winter ended, trial sledge runs resumed, to test equipment and rations in advance of the planned southern journey which Scott, Wilson and Shackleton were to undertake. Meanwhile, a party under Royds travelled to Cape Crozier to leave a message at the post there, and discovered an emperor penguin colony. Another group, under Armitage, reconnoitred in the mountains to the west, returning in October with the expedition's first symptoms of scurvy. Armitage later blamed the outbreak on Scott's [...] "sentimental objection" [...] to the slaughter of animals for fresh meat. The entire expedition's diet was quickly revised, and <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>was</b> thereafter contained.|$|E
500|$|On 10 August, Patton {{entered the}} {{receiving}} tent of the hospital, {{speaking to the}} injured there. Patton approached Bennett, who was huddled and shivering, and asked what <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>was.</b> [...] "It's my nerves," [...] Bennett responded. [...] "I can't stand the shelling anymore." [...] Patton reportedly became enraged at him, slapping him across the face. He began yelling: [...] "Your nerves, hell, you are just a goddamned coward. Shut up that goddamned crying. I won't have these brave {{men who have been}} shot at seeing this yellow bastard sitting here crying." [...] Patton then reportedly slapped Bennett again, knocking his helmet liner off, and ordered the receiving officer, Major Charles B. Etter, not to admit him. Patton then threatened Bennett, [...] "You're going back to the front lines and you may get shot and killed, but you're going to fight. If you don't, I'll stand you up against a wall and have a firing squad kill you on purpose. In fact, I ought to shoot you myself, you goddamned whimpering coward." [...] Upon saying this, Patton pulled out his pistol threateningly, prompting the hospital's commander, Colonel Donald E. Currier, to physically separate the two. Patton left the tent, yelling to medical officers to send Bennett back to the front lines.|$|E
500|$|Following the members' poll, Yorkshire sent a {{telegram}} to Sutcliffe in South Africa, {{asking him to}} withdraw his acceptance of the captaincy. Sutcliffe replied that he had now considered the offer and was appreciative but had to decline it. When news reached the Yorkshire committee on 18 December, they appointed William Worsley, who had refused the leadership in 1924 due to farming commitments. In the words of Wisden, [...] "Happily <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>was</b> eventually settled {{to the satisfaction of}} all concerned. Sutcliffe declined the honour and, an invitation being extended to Captain Worsley, that gentleman stepped into the breach." [...] Lord Hawke sent a message which thanked Sutcliffe for [...] "your loyalty to the club". The Yorkshire Post also paid tribute to Sutcliffe and the way he handled himself, noting that while a conflict of opinion had been inevitable, it was [...] "carried to unreasonable lengths". Commenting on the affair, The Times expressed regret that Sutcliffe had felt obliged to turn down the leadership; it noted that amateur captains were preferable in reminding people that cricket was only a game, but that there was nothing in principle to prevent a professional from performing the role. Of Sutcliffe, it said, [...] "One would have liked to see him lead the side, and his general popularity, combined with his skill as a batsman, makes it probable that {{he would have been a}} success. However, half the value of a captain is gone if, before he takes up his duties, people begin to question whether he is the right man for the position, and Sutcliffe has been well-advised to recognise this fact." [...] The newspaper also pointed out that it might have been difficult to choose a skipper from a group of professionals who considered themselves eligible for the role; it added that Rhodes might have found it hard to captain the side as bowlers had historically struggled to be good leaders.|$|E

2500|$|Adjacent to Studio B was a {{reverberation}} room containing a plate reverb device made by EMT, German makers of similar effects units installed in other recording studios around the world. The EMT reverb was an electro-mechanical echo chamber used to add artificial reverberation effects to recordings. Porter {{arranged to have}} the dedicated echo room cooled down {{as much as possible}} with an air conditioner, and he adjusted the ten springs on the EMT plate to be tighter than usual, in order to feed the plate more audio signal and get a cleaner sound returning from the device. So much signal was being sent to the plate that Porter disconnected the associated VU meter so {{that he would not be}} bothered with its needle slamming against its peg.

[...] Stimson testified at the {{preliminary}} hearing that he had hired Coyne to accompany his son to Mexico the prior month. [...] Shortly after returning from Mexico, Coyne told Stimson {{that he was in}} danger from the machinations of a notorious Mexican criminal. [...] Coyne offered his services to help foil the attack. [...] Over a period of time, Coyne advised Stimson that the criminal had been attempting to break into the house, and sought to verify his claim with the discovery of tools and marks on a window. [...] Coyne also claimed that the criminal had poisoned Stimson’s dog, after which the Stimson family dog became sick. [...] After the explosion, Coyne told Stimson that <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>was</b> still not over, that he was in constant danger of being shot or stabbed and that the crooks had eleven sticks of dynamite remaining that would be used for another attack on the house. [...] Coyne suggested {{that the only way to}} stop the culprits was to kill them, and [...] he offered his services to take care of the matter. [...] Stimson confronted Coyne and told him he suspected the affair to be a blackmailing scheme by Coyne himself. [...] Coyne’s minute information as to the supposed crooks' plans and actions betrayed his role in the crime, and he was eventually convicted and sentenced to five years at Folsom Prison.|$|E
2500|$|As Buchanan commented:Harder {{to brush}} off was the {{impression}} that Eysenck [...] was insensitive, even willfully blind to the way his work played out in a wider political context. He {{did not want to}} believe, {{almost to the point of}} utter refusal, that his work gave succor to right-wing racialist groups. But there is little doubt that Jensen and Eysenck helped revive the confidence of these groups. [...] It was unexpected vindication from a respectable scientific quarter. The cautionary language of Eysenck's interpretation of the evidence made little difference. To the racialist right, a genetic basis for group differences in intelligence bore out racialist claims of inherent, immutable hierarchy.Buchanan exemplifies Eysenck's cautionary approach with a number of concrete examples from Eysenck's writings, and concludes that:If the appropriation of his work by right-wing groups brought him baggage that would be hard to shake off, how then did he construe his relationship with them? Eysenck was a scientist who believed that good research would eventually help temper social wrongs and excesses. <b>The</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>was</b> that the empirical science was clearly taken to be part of the problem as well as the solution. Its very impartiality was itself held up to question. The lack of consensus on the technical issues fed open-ended arguments about truth, social justice, and how we should live. Thus the controversy ran on and on.Eysenck's defence was that ultimately he did not shy away from publishing or being interviewed in controversial publications, and that he did not necessarily share their editorial viewpoint. Buchanan suggests that this may have been true in general, with an Eysenck interview appearing in Mayfair and several articles by Eysenck being published in Penthouse. In his autobiography, Eysenck answered his critics with: [...] "It is odd, and indeed paradoxical, that my most determined opponents should have been people with whose aims I completely agreed." [...] Regarding the equality of people, Eysenck wrote: The major argument in modern times is between those who define equality in terms of social status, and those who define it in terms of equality of biological inheritance. Equality of social status has always been a socialist idea, and it is certainly possible to argue about its desirability, or the possibility of achieving it. Equality of biological abilities and traits is a chimera which no thinking person should entertain for one moment. Eysenck stated his own views in the Introduction to Race, Education and Intelligence: he reader is consequently entitled to ask in which direction the writer's own political and social beliefs and attitudes go. [...] My recognition of the importance of the racial problem, and my own attitudes of opposition to any kind of racial segregation, and hatred for those who suppress any sector of the community on grounds of race (or sex or religion) were determined in part by the fact that I grew up in Germany, at a time when Hitlerism was becoming the very widely held doctrine which finally prevailed and led to the deaths of several million Jews whose only crime was that they belonged to an imaginary [...] "race" [...] which had been dreamed up by a group of men in whom insanity was mixed in equal parts with craftiness, paranoia with guile, and villainy with sadism.|$|E
