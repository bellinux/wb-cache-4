40|$|Dynamometer {{performance}} of a South Coast Technology electric conversion of a Volkswagen (VW) Rabbit designated SCT- 8 was tested. The SCT- 8 vehicle was fitted with a <b>transistorized</b> <b>chopper</b> in the motor armature circuit to supplement the standard motor speed control via field weakening. The armature chopper allowed speed control below the motor base speed. This low speed control was intended to reduce energy loss at idle during stop-and-go traffic; to {{eliminate the need for}} using the clutch below base motor speed; and to improve the drivability. Test results indicate an improvement of about 3. 5 % in battery energy economy for the SAE J 227 a-D driving cycle and 6 % for the C-cycle with only a minor reduction in acceleration performance. A further reduction of about 6 % would be possible if provision were made for shutting down field power during the idle phases of the driving cycles. Drivability of the vehicle equipped with the armature chopper was significantly improved compared with the standard SCT Electric Rabbit...|$|E
40|$|A {{test and}} {{analysis}} program performed on four complete propulsion systems for an {{urban electric vehicle}} (EV) is described and results given. A dc series motor and a permanent magnet (PM) motor were tested, each powered by an EV battery pack and controlled by (1) a series/parallel voltage-switching (V-switch) system; and (2) a system using a pulse width modulation, 400 Hz <b>transistorized</b> <b>chopper.</b> Dynamometer tests were first performed, followed by eV performance predictions and data correlating road tests. During dynamometer tests using chopper control; current, voltage, and power were measured on both the battery and motor sides of the chopper, using three types of instrumentation. Conventional dc instruments provided adequate accuracy for eV power and energy measurements, when used on the battery side of the controller. When using the chopper controller, {{the addition of a}} small choke inductor improved system efficiency in the lower duty cycle range (some 8 % increase at 50 % duty cycle) with both types of motors. Overall system efficiency rankings during road tests were: (1) series motor with V-switch; (2) PM motor with V-switch; (3) series motor with chopper; and (4) PM motor with chopper. Chopper control of the eV was smoother and required less driver skill than V-switch control...|$|E
