5|$|Much of the inter-war period saw {{economic}} recession or stagnant growth, making fund-raising more challenging. Partially as a result, many memorial projects had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> back or altered {{due to lack}} of money. The final size of Douaumont had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> in size by a third when fund-raising slowed. Proposals to turn the planned Imperial War Museum into a grand memorial for the war dead were shelved {{due to lack of}} funds.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium is a {{rare earth}} element that has a metallic, bright silver luster. It is soft enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> with a knife, and can be {{machined}} without sparking if overheating is avoided. Dysprosium's physical characteristics can be greatly affected by even small amounts of impurities.|$|E
5|$|The {{hardness}} of {{diamond and}} its ability to cleave strongly depend on the crystal orientation. Therefore, the crystallographic structure of the diamond <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> is analyzed using X-ray diffraction to choose the optimal cutting directions.|$|E

50|$|The concept <b>was</b> <b>to</b> play {{only the}} current hits on the Top 30 (or Top 50 on some stations) and no recurrents (that is, recent hits {{which had already}} {{finished}} their run on the charts) or oldies whatsoever (unless they happened <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cuts</b> on current chart albums).|$|R

5|$|An episode {{centered}} on Betty {{had been promised}} by the crew at San Diego Comic-Con International in 2012. Due to the subject matter and length of the episode, several scenes had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> or trimmed for time, since so much was being placed in the episode. A review by Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club was complimentary towards the story, and Sava also applauded Dunham's voice-acting.|$|E
5|$|Director Brad Bird {{wanted to}} open the episode with a close up of Krusty's face. The staff liked the idea and he then {{suggested}} that all three acts of the episode, defined by {{the placement of the}} commercial breaks, should begin with a close up shot. Act one begins with Krusty's face introducing the audience at his show, act two begins with Krusty's face being locked up behind bars, and act three begins with Sideshow Bob's face on a big poster. Krusty's character is based on a television clown from Portland, Oregon, called Rusty Nails, whom The Simpsons creator Matt Groening watched while growing up in Portland. The original teleplay, written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky, was 78 pages long and many scenes had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut.</b> One scene that had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> down was the scene where Patty and Selma show the slideshow of their vacation; it originally contained images of them being detained for bringing heroin into America.|$|E
5|$|Due to the MTA {{financial}} {{crisis in the}} late 2000s, the G was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> back from Forest Hills–71st Avenue to Court Square at all times beginning June 27, 2010. However, due to planned track repairs during the times the G normally ran on the IND Queens Boulevard Line, it ceased running on that line on April 19. In addition, train headways were reduced, which inconvenienced about 201,000 weekly commuters since they had to wait longer for G trains.|$|E
50|$|A {{scene where}} Sean beats a dealer <b>to</b> death <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> by seven seconds {{in order to}} get an R rating instead of NC-17.|$|R

5000|$|According to Waters, when {{he asked}} the MPAA what {{he would need to}} cut {{in order for them to}} give his film an R rating, they replied that [...] "after a while, we just stopped taking notes", and if {{everything}} they objected <b>to</b> <b>was</b> <b>cut,</b> only ten minutes could be distributed. [...] They decided to simply release it with an NC-17 rating.|$|R
5|$|Four months later, in May 2005, {{a second}} spike had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> off by firefighters {{after it was}} {{discovered}} hanging loose. At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public, and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed. As a result, some of the joints were re-welded, with equipment {{put in place to}} prevent excessive movement. This consisted of retrofitting tip weights to 70% of the spikes' weights.|$|E
5|$|Lithium metal is soft enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> with a knife. When cut, it {{possesses}} a silvery-white color that quickly changes to gray as it oxidizes to lithium oxide. While {{it has one}} of the lowest melting points among all metals (180°C), it has the highest melting and boiling points of the alkali metals.|$|E
5|$|One {{section of}} the M11 {{extension}} was due to tunnel under George Green in Wanstead. Residents had believed that this would save their green, and a 250-year-old sweet chestnut tree that grew upon it, but {{because this was a}} cut and cover tunnel, this required the tree <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> down.|$|E

5|$|The abrupt {{cutting off}} of God's voice before he reveals {{the meaning of}} life was {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> off by a voiceover promotion for whatever Fox program aired after The Simpsons. However, Fox did not pick up on this and so God's voice was instead cut off by the show's credits.|$|E
5|$|The {{assets of}} Icelandic pension funds are, {{according}} to one expert, expected to shrink by 15–25%. The Icelandic Pension Funds Association has announced that benefits will in all likelihood have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> in 2009. Iceland's GDP is expected by economists to shrink {{by as much as}} 10% {{as a result of the}} crisis, putting Iceland by some measures in an economic depression. Inflation may climb as high as 75% by the end of the year.|$|E
5|$|The cemetery's headstones are {{oriented}} both to {{the east}} and to the west. The majority are simple in design, inscribed with birth and death dates, and consist of a combination of rounded, arched stones, rectangular stones, and pyramidal-shaped obelisks that appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> from limestone. In the cemetery's southern section are several small rectangular stones that probably serve as footstones. Beginning around 1950, the gravestones erected in the cemetery became more intricate with polished granite surfaces lying atop rough-cut stone foundations.|$|E
30|$|Semithin {{sections}} (1 μm <b>to</b> 2 μm) <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> on a Reichert–Jung ultramicrotome {{and stained}} with methylene blue. The sections were examined under a Leica DMLB light microscope. Ultrathin sections (60 nm <b>to</b> 90 nm) <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> on an LKB- 8000 II ultramicrotome, and collected on 200 mesh nickel grids with 0.3 % Formvar.|$|R

5|$|The tender Daisy 2, skippered by John Gatt, {{had been}} tied {{up for the}} night to Royal Oaks port side. As the sinking {{battleship}} began to list to starboard, Gatt ordered Daisy 2 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> loose, his vessel becoming briefly caught on Royal Oaks rising anti-torpedo bulge and lifted from the sea before freeing herself.|$|E
5|$|A common {{situation}} in ski jumping, and especially ski flying {{due to the}} magnified risks overall, arises when unfavourable weather conditions cause a competition <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> short or cancelled completely; it is also not uncommon for an entire event to be cancelled. Reasons include strong winds, a lack of (or too much) snow, and poor visibility for athletes or judges. In {{the case of a}} shortened competition, the scores from the first round – if completed – are used to determine the final result. This is called a single-round competition and still counts towards both the Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup. For the World Championships, if one of the two competitions is cancelled, the final result will be based on the competition that took place.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Mimoyecques site lay abandoned. Much of the {{equipment}} left by the Germans was disposed of as scrap metal. A complete set of four steel plates, weighing 60 tons, that were intended to protect the entrances to the drifts were bought by {{the manager of the}} Hidrequent-Rixent quarries <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> up for use in rock-crushing machinery. Rediscovered by local historians in the 1990s, they remained at the quarries until 2010, when the surviving plates were returned to Mimoyecques, where they are now on display.|$|E

5|$|At 15:00 Lhermitte {{ordered the}} masts on Preneuse <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> {{away and the}} frigate and battery then opened fire on Adamant, which was {{carefully}} sailing through the coastal shoals {{in an effort to}} engage the beached French ship. For more than two hours Hotham's ship worked its way inshore until at 17:30 it was well positioned to open fire, unleashing its broadside on the wrecked Preneuse. By 17:45 it was clear that further resistance was futile and Lhermitte struck his colours. Preneuse had surrendered, but was likely damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|Cerium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ce and atomic number 58. Cerium is a soft, ductile and silvery-white metal that tarnishes {{when exposed to}} air, and it is soft enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> with a knife. Cerium is the second element in the lanthanide series, and while it often shows the +3 oxidation state characteristic of the series, it also exceptionally has a stable +4 state that does not oxidize water. It is also traditionally {{considered one of the}} rare-earth elements. Cerium has no biological role and is not very toxic.|$|E
5|$|Colder weather, {{bringing}} with it rain and snow on September 11 calmed the fires down substantially throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Though the fires continued to burn {{well into the}} middle of November, they never again posed an immediate risk to life or property. Many fire crews were sent home, but additional manpower continued to arrive at Yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had been affected by the firefighting efforts. Hundreds of miles of firelines, helicopter landing zones and fire camps needed to be restored to a more natural state, and thousands of hazardous dead trees needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> down to protect roads and buildings. Finally, on November 18, all fires in Yellowstone were officially declared out.|$|E
