25|$|While Carnegie did {{not comment}} on British imperialism, he very {{strongly}} opposed the idea of American colonies. He strongly opposed the annexation of the Philippines, {{almost to the point}} of supporting William Jennings Bryan against McKinley in 1900. In 1898, Carnegie tried to arrange for independence for the Philippines. As the end of the Spanish–American War neared, the United States bought the Philippines from Spain for $20 million. To counter what he perceived as imperialism on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, Carnegie personally offered $20 million to the Philippines so that the Filipino people could buy their independence from the United States. However, nothing came of the offer. In 1898 Carnegie joined the American Anti-Imperialist League, in opposition to the U.S. annexation of the Philippines. Its membership included former presidents of the United States Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison and literary figures like Mark Twain.|$|E

The Plenipotentiary Conference is the top policy-making body of the ITU, meeting every four years in order to set the Union's general policies. The ITU {{is divided into three}} Sectors: the Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) determines the technical characteristics and operational procedures for wireless services, and plays a vital role in the Spectrum Management of the radio-frequency; ITU-R Study Group 1 is the Spectrum Management study group; the Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) develops internationally agreed technical and operating standards; and the Telecommunication Development Sector (ITU-D) fosters the expansion of telecommunications infrastructure in developing nations throughout the world, that make up two-thirds of the ITU’s 191 Member States. The ITU Radio Regulations set a binding international treaty governing the use of the radio spectrum by some 40 different services.|$|E
500|$|Increasing {{impoverishment}} {{among the}} Sioux and continued treaty violations on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States would soon lead to bloodshed. In 1857 a renegade band of Sioux led by war chief Inkpaduta attacked {{the community of}} Spirit Lake, Iowa near the Minnesota border killing between 35 and 40 [...] "white" [...] settlers (the event would {{be referred to as}} the Spirit Lake Massacre). They went on to attack Springfield, Minnesota (modern Jackson) killing seven before being turned back. In 1862, bands of Sioux launched the Dakota War in which they were defeated. Apart from those killed in the war, 38 Dakota Sioux were killed in a mass execution in Mankato, the largest mass execution in the U.S. history. Hundreds more Sioux and European-Americans were killed in the U.S. government's subsequent eradication of the Sioux nation in Minnesota and the new Dakota Territory.|$|E

500|$|After Hayes' falling-out {{with the}} Republican Party and a {{perceived}} desire on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States' electorate {{for a strong}} man in the White House, Grant returned to the United States ahead of schedule, in hopes of seeking a third term in office. With {{the backing of the}} Stalwarts and calls for a [...] "man of iron" [...] to replace the [...] "man of straw" [...] in the White House, Grant was confident that he would receive the Republican nomination for the presidency. Roscoe Conkling, the leader of the Stalwart faction, formed a [...] "triumvirate" [...] with J. Donald Cameron of Pennsylvania and John A. Logan of Illinois to lead the campaign for Grant's return to the White House. With a Grant victory, Conkling and other Stalwarts would have great influence in the White House. Grant knew he could count on the Stalwart leaders to solidify their respective states in order to guarantee a Grant victory. Conkling was so confident in Grant's nomination that he said, [...] "Nothing but an act of God could prevent Grant's nomination." [...] An aide to the ex-president, Adam Badeau, commented that Grant had become [...] "extremely anxious to receive the nomination" [...] and did not think that there was any chance of failure.|$|E
500|$|After the American {{invasion}} of Afghanistan fails to uproot the alleged terrorist organisation, the Bush administration focuses inwards, searching unsuccessfully for terrorist sleeper cells in America. In 2003, they extend the War on Terror {{to a war}} on general perceived evils with the {{invasion of}} Iraq. The ideas and tactics also spread to the United Kingdom, where Tony Blair uses {{the threat of terrorism}} to give him a new moral authority. The repercussions of the neoconservative strategy are also explored, with an investigation of indefinitely-detained terrorist suspects in Guantanamo Bay, many allegedly taken on the word of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance without actual investigation on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States military, and other forms of [...] "preemption" [...] against non-existent and unlikely threats made simply {{on the grounds that the}} parties involved had the potential to become a threat. Curtis specifically attempts to allay fears of a dirty bomb attack, and concludes by reassuring viewers that politicians will eventually have to concede that some threats are exaggerated and others have no foundation in reality. He says, [...] "In an age when all the grand ideas have lost credibility, fear of a phantom enemy is all the politicians have left to maintain their power." ...|$|E
500|$|The Soviets had few {{operable}} ICBMs; {{in spite}} of this Khrushchev publicly boasted of the Soviets' missile programs, stating that Soviet weapons were varied and numerous. The First Secretary hoped that public perception that the Soviets were ahead would result in psychological pressure on the West and political concessions. The Soviet space program, which Khrushchev firmly supported, appeared to confirm his claims when the Soviets launched Sputnik 1 into orbit, a launch many westerners, including United States Vice President Richard Nixon were convinced was a hoax. When {{it became clear that the}} launch was real, and Sputnik 1 was in orbit, Western governments concluded that the Soviet ICBM program was further along than it actually was. Khrushchev added to this misapprehension by stating in an October 1957 interview that the USSR had all the rockets, of whatever capacity, that it needed. For years, Khrushchev would make a point of preceding a major foreign trip with a rocket launch, to the discomfiture of his hosts. The United States learned of the primitive state of the Soviet missile program from overflights in the late 1950s, but only high U.S. officials knew of the deception. In January 1960, Khrushchev told the Presidium that Soviet ICBMs made an agreement with the U.S. possible because [...] "main-street Americans have begun to shake from fear for the first times in their lives". The perceived [...] "missile gap" [...] led to a considerable defense buildup on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.|$|E

2500|$|On 11 April 1898, McKinley asked Congress for {{authority}} to send U.S. troops to Cuba {{for the purpose}} of ending the civil war there. On 19 April, Congress passed joint resolutions (by a vote of 311 to 6 in the House and 42 to 35 in the Senate) supporting Cuban independence and disclaiming any intention to annex Cuba, demanding Spanish withdrawal, and authorizing the president to use as much military force as he thought necessary to help Cuban patriots gain independence from Spain. This was adopted by resolution of Congress and included from Senator Henry Teller the Teller Amendment, which passed unanimously, stipulating that [...] "the island of Cuba is, and by right should be, free and independent". The amendment disclaimed any intention on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States to exercise jurisdiction or control over Cuba for other than pacification reasons, and confirmed that the armed forces would be removed once the war is over. Senate and Congress passed the amendment on April 19, McKinley signed the joint resolution on 20 April and the ultimatum was forwarded to Spain. War was declared on 20/21 April 1898.|$|E
