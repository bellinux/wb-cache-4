40|$|The Norwegian marine {{datacenter}} (NMD) started serving {{operational research}} data from vessels {{operated by the}} Institute of Marine Research in the early 2000. Through the EU FP 7 project MyOcean NMD has become the <b>thematic</b> <b>assembly</b> center for Arctic in-situ data. As a <b>thematic</b> <b>assembly</b> center NMD deliver in-situ data to the global assembly center and to the ocean forecasting centers where it’s used for assimilation or validation of model output. The data service has been expanded to include data from other data sources like the Coriolis data service. Real time quality control procedures have been defined in the MyOcean project and all data goes through these procedures and are flagged according to the SeaDataNet Quality flag scale. The Institute of Marine Research has also started work to operationalise other data types gathered on research vessels. These data types include different kinds of biological samples and chemical data that will become available to scientists in near real tim...|$|R

Some AtlantOS networks are organized as DAC-GDACs that continuously update a catalogue of metadata on observation datasets and platforms: •	A DAC is a Data <b>Assembly</b> <b>Centre</b> operating at national or regional scale. It manages data and metadata for its area with a direct link to Scientifics and Operators. The DAC pushes observations to the network GDAC. •	A GDAC is a Global Data <b>Assembly</b> <b>Centre.</b> It is designed for a global observation network such as Argo, OceanSITES, DBCP, EGO, Gosud, etc… The GDAC aggregates data and metadata of an observation network, in real-time and delayed mode, provided by DACs...|$|R
