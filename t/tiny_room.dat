5|$|In 1830 Honoré de Balzac {{had only}} begun to achieve {{recognition}} as a writer. Although his parents had persuaded him to make his profession the law, he announced in 1819 {{that he wanted to}} become an author. His mother was distraught, but she and his father agreed to give him a small income, on the condition that he dedicate himself to writing, and deliver to them half of his gross income from any published work. After moving into a <b>tiny</b> <b>room</b> near the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in Paris, Balzac wrote for one year, without success. Frustrated, he moved back to his family in the suburb of Villeparisis and borrowed money from his parents to pursue his literary ambitions further. He spent the next several years writing simple potboiler novels, which he published under a variety of pseudonyms. He shared some of his income from these with his parents, but by 1828 he still owed them 50,000 francs.|$|E

In November, Chinese authorities were again investigating Ai and his associates, this time under the charge of spreading pornography.|$|E
25|$|In 1842, {{after a year}} {{among the}} Potawatomi, {{it was clear that}} Duchesne's health could not sustain the regime of village life and she {{returned}} to St Charles. She spent the last decade of her life living there in a <b>tiny</b> <b>room</b> under a stairway near the chapel. Toward the end of her life, she was very lonely, going blind, feeble, and yearned for letters from Mother Barat. She died on November 18, 1852, aged 83.|$|E

25|$|The new {{governor}} of South Carolina, William Henry Lyttelton, {{declared war on}} the Cherokee in 1759. The governor embargoed all shipments of gunpowder to the Cherokee and raised an army of 1,100 provincial troops which marched to confront the Lower Towns of the Cherokee. Desperate for ammunition for their fall and winter hunts, the nation sent a peace delegation of moderate chiefs to negotiate. The thirty-two chiefs were taken prisoner, as hostages, and, escorted by the provincial army, were sent to Fort Prince George and held in a <b>tiny</b> <b>room</b> only big enough for six people. Three of the chiefs were released conditionally, Lyttleton thought this would ensure peace.|$|E

60|$|Under {{the little}} balcony wall Argyle had put square red-tiled pots, all round, {{and in these}} still bloomed a few pansies and asters, whilst in a corner a monthly rose hung flowers like round blood-drops.

25|$|At Dakshineswar, Sarada Devi {{stayed in}} a <b>tiny</b> <b>room</b> in the nahabat (music tower). She stayed at Dakshineswar until 1885, except for short periods when she visited Jayrambati. By this time Ramakrishna had already embraced the monastic life of a sannyasin; as a result, the {{marriage}} was never consummated. As a priest, Ramakrishna performed the ritual ceremony—the Shodashi Puja where Sarada Devi was made {{to sit in the}} seat of goddess Kali, and worshiped as the divine mother Tripurasundari. According to Swami Saradananda a direct disciple of Ramakrishna, Ramakrishna married to show the world an ideal of a sexless marriage. Ramakrishna regarded Sarada as an incarnation of the Divine Mother, addressing her as Sree Maa (Holy Mother) and it was by this name that she was known to Ramakrishna's disciples.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Disturbia" [...] begins in a surrealistic, circus-like torture chamber where Rihanna is seen dressed in black, wearing dark make-up and having long black nails while she presses the keys {{of a big}} dark piano and looks into the camera. As the song starts {{different}} images of Rihanna are shown. In one of the scenes she is seen imprisoned wearing lenses that make look as if her eyes have rolled {{into the back of}} her head. Rihanna stays in the prison with two men watching on her from the both sides. Other scenes include Rihanna sitting on a throne chair and singing the song, while two strange women (one is played by American drag queen Detox Icunt) are around her. Then, multiple people around her are holding her in front of a gas chamber. As the chorus starts Rihanna is seen tied up in a bed from which she can't get out. At the bridge of the song Rihanna and her dancers are performing a Thriller-esque dance routine. As the second verse starts, Rihanna is seen holding a column and fire is around her. As the song continues, Rihanna drags a man doll around a metal web. In the second chorus she wears a metal spines corset while one tarantula is upon her arm. In the later scene, Rihanna is in a very <b>tiny</b> <b>room,</b> with her hands and legs been tied up. The video ends with Rihanna turning around on her chair.|$|E
2500|$|The plot of [...] "Going Abroad" [...] depicts someone's {{convoluted}} {{attempt to}} leave the country for good.

His wife, jealous of his contacts with a seal, decides against it, but offers him various parting gifts: flatbread, a kite, and a sketchbook by art teacher Borgovanu. This results in a quarrel, and the protagonist finds himself tied by the cheekbones, [...] "delivered unceremoniously on dry land." [...] For a third attempt at leaving, the husband relinquishes wealth and titles, strips down and, bound with a bark rope, gallops to another town, joining the bar association.

2500|$|... "The Funnel and Stamate" [...] {{insists on}} the {{geographical}} setting of Urmuzian misadventures. Stamate's townhouse is {{a haven for}} objects or beings, their presence inventoried over several rooms. Only accessible through a tube, the windowless first room holds together {{a sample of the}} thing-in-itself, the statue of a Transylvanian priest and grammarian, and two humans always [...] "in the process of descending from the ape". The second room, decorated in [...] "Turkish style" [...] and [...] "eastern luxury", is painted once a day and carefully measured, by compass, to prevent shrinkage. A third section, under the [...] "Turkish" [...] room, houses a limitless canal, a <b>tiny</b> <b>room</b> and a stake [...] "to which the entire Stamate family is tethered." [...] The [...] "dignified" [...] and [...] "elliptical" [...] head of the clan spits chewed-up celluloid on his fat boy Bufty, who [...] "pretends not to notice". For relaxation, the Stamates contemplate Nirvana, located over the canal and [...] "in the same precinct" [...] as them. Old Stamate's musings are interrupted by the provocative intrusion of a siren, who lures him into the deep by presenting him with [...] "an innocent and too decent looking funnel." [...] Stamate returns [...] "a better and more tolerant man", deciding to use the funnel for both the pleasures of sex and those of science. Neglecting his family duties, he goes on nightly expeditions into the funnel, until he discovers in horror that Bufty uses the funnel for a similar purpose. Stamate then decides to part with his wife (sewing her in a bag, to [...] "preserve the cultural traditions of his family") and with Bufty: trapped in the funnel, the boy is sent over to Nirvana, where Stamate makes sure he becomes a [...] "bureau sub-chief". Stamate is left alone to contemplate his plight, wandering to and fro at great speed, and submerging [...] "into micro-infinity." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{companionway}} {{into the}} main cabin was a steep ladder, and down this, after his meal, Jerry was carried by the captain. The cabin was a long room, extending for the full width of the Arangi from a lazarette aft to a <b>tiny</b> <b>room</b> for'ard. For'ard of this room, separated by a tight bulkhead, was the forecastle where lived the boat's crew. The <b>tiny</b> <b>room</b> was shared between Van Horn and Borckman, while the main cabin was occupied by the three-score and odd return boys.

5000|$|McPherson was paroled in October 1955. He needed {{legitimate}} {{employment to}} satisfy his parole conditions, {{and it was}} at this time that he established his infamous [...] "motel".
