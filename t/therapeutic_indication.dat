40|$|AbstractDrug {{therapeutic}} indications and side-effects {{are both}} measurable patient phenotype changes {{in response to}} the treatment. Inferring potential drug therapeutic indications and identifying clinically interesting drug side-effects are both important and challenging tasks. Previous studies have utilized either chemical structures or protein targets to predict indications and side-effects. In this study, we compared drug <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indication</b> prediction using various information including chemical structures, protein targets and side-effects. We also compared drug side-effect prediction with various information sources including chemical structures, protein targets and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indication.</b> Prediction performance based on 10 -fold cross-validation demonstrates that drug side-effects and therapeutic indications are the most predictive information source for each other.

40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) is an ocular inflammatory diseases treated mainly {{by means of}} a bevacizumab (Avastin&# 174;) or ranibizumab (Lucentis&# 174;) intravitreal injection. Among these drugs, only ranibizumab has a specific <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indication</b> for AMD. Considering that, the off-label use on ophthalmic therapy seems to become a rule when it should be an exception. Furthermore, bevacizumab presentation consists of multi-dose vials although it does not contain preservatives in its formula. The current literature review aimed at assessing the risks for the patient related to the use of off-label indication and multi-dose vials on AMD treatment. Considering this, the proposal related to the Brazilian Public Consultation no. 10, dated September 12, 2012, which proposes the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for AMD treatment, was evaluated. This systematic review allowed to conclude that the bevacizumab off-label indication results in increased risks for the patient when compared to the product with specific <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indication</b> for AMD treatment (ranibizumab), especially referring to the significant raise in the adverse events. The risks for the patient related to the multi-dose vial use, referring to the microbiological stability and dose precision, were also made clear...|$|E

40|$|Instrument to {{evaluate}} the level of knowledge about prescription in primary care OBJECTIVE: To develop and test an instrument {{to evaluate}} patients ’ level of knowledge about drug prescription. METHODS: This {{study was conducted with}} users registered with the Family Health Strategy clinics of the city of Santa Cruz do Sul, Southern Brazil, selected by consecutive sampling. Name of the medication, <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indication,</b> drug dosage, times of administration, forms of use, duration of treatment, attitude when doses are missed, possible adverse effects and interactions were included in this study. Each item of the scale was weighted, according to the importance for safe prescribed drug use. The questionnaire was tested by applying an interview to users in 2006 and by analyzing 320 prescriptions. Descriptive statistics, prevalence ratios and chi-square test were calculated for categorical variables and the Tukey test was calculated to compare means. RESULTS: The level of knowledge about drug therapy was considered good in 11. 3 % of participants, fair in 42. 5 %, and insuffi cient in 46. 3 %. The highest levels of knowledge were observed in times of administration, <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indication</b> and duration of treatment. The lowest levels occurred in drug dosage, adverse effects and attitude when one or more drug doses are missed. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed instrument enabled the analysis of the magnitude of the gap existing between what the patients must know and what they actually know about their medications.

These beliefs are crucial {{for the development of}} a nursing intervention for nurses working with community-dwelling elderly, in the middle of the Netherlands. Aim: to assess the beliefs of community-dwelling elderly, regarding to medication, in the Netherlands. Research questions: “What are the beliefs of community-dwelling elderly, regarding to necessity, concerns, overuse and harm of medication, in the Netherlands?” (primary research question), and: “What are the beliefs about medicines for participants with differences in age, gender, educational level, number of medicines a day and therapeutic indications of medicines?” (secondary research question). Method: this quantitative cross-sectional survey examines the beliefs about medicines of community-dwelling elderly in five general practices in the Netherlands, and the relationship between beliefs and respectively age, gender, educational level, number and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indication</b> of medicines. Beliefs were measured using the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), in a single interview. Results: the 91 study participants (median age = 71. 0 years) had strong beliefs in the necessity of their medicines, while beliefs in concerns, overuse and harm were less strong. Associations were found between beliefs and gender, educational level, <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indication</b> of medicines and number of medicines. Conclusion: the results of this study give an impression of how elderly view their medicines, namely as necessary, with in minority aspects like concerns, harm, and overuse. Recommendations: More attention should be paid to elderly’s individual beliefs about their medicines. Further research, using a qualitative design, is needed to gain a better understanding of this phenomenon. This could contribute to tailored interventions and care for elderly...|$|E

Fluorine imparts desirable characteristics to drugs by modulating both the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic properties of a drug. Therefore, incorporation of fluorine into a drug increases the lipophilicty enhancing absorption into biological membranes whereby its small covalent radius can facilitate docking with their drug receptor(s).
