5|$|A {{lithography}} in the 1858 {{edition of}} the Greek akolouthia shows <b>the</b> <b>saint</b> wearing a crown with a double lily wreath, his right foot on a sword. He holds a cross, a sceptre, and an olive branch in his right hand, while his crowned severed head is in his left hand. He wears an ermine cloak and a robe with floral designs, adorned with large gems surrounded by pearls. The Greek text beneath the illustration names <b>the</b> <b>saint</b> as Jovan Vladimir, the pious Emperor of all Albania and Bulgaria, the graceful Wonderworker and Great Martyr, and true Myrrh-gusher. In his hagiography included in the Synaxarium of Nicodemus the Hagiorite, <b>the</b> <b>saint</b> {{is referred to as}} Emperor of the Serbs (τῶν Σέρβων βασιλεύς).|$|E
40|$|The {{authority}} of <b>the</b> <b>saints</b> is, in a sense, presupposed by the tradition, and yet, formulating this presupposition {{proves to be}} awkward. This dissertation is an exploration into the nature, the grounding {{and the limits of}} the {{authority of}} <b>the</b> <b>saints,</b> with reference to the theology of <b>the</b> <b>saints</b> in <b>the</b> work of Hans urs von Balthasar. My argument is that, in his use of <b>the</b> <b>saints,</b> Balthasar does not merely interpret <b>the</b> <b>saints</b> as a resource for theologians and for the Magisterium. For Balthasar, theology and the Magisterium are there to serve <b>the</b> <b>saints,</b> since <b>the</b> <b>saints</b> are <b>the</b> real witnesses whose testimony requires dynamic paraphrase and vigorous rendition. My argument will be that Balthasar wants to avoid the theory of multiple teaching offices, but that – while avoiding the theory of multiple offices – also attributes to <b>the</b> <b>saints</b> an authority that is analogical to that of the Magisterium. Balthasar uses <b>the</b> <b>saints,</b> not only to teach other theologians but also to teach the official Magisterium, thus handling <b>the</b> <b>saints</b> as if they were themselves a Magisterium. Four dimensions – the existential, the epistemological, the pneumatological and the ecclesiological – are identified and used to elucidate the nature, the grounding and the function of the authority of <b>the</b> <b>saints.</b> It will be argued that authority of <b>the</b> <b>saints</b> is grounded within each one of these dimensions and that these are the dimensions within which <b>the</b> <b>saints</b> function authoritatively. I will defend my own construal of Balthasar, argue for the credibility of Balthasar’s defence of the authority of <b>the</b> <b>saints,</b> as well as, locate and criticise some of the contradictions that are found in Balthasar in this regard, and identify some of the consequences of Balthasar’s position concerning the authority of <b>the</b> <b>saints,</b> for his own theology, for theology in general, and for the Church...|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} {{model for}} the iconography of Saint Jovan Vladimir is an engraving in the 1690 edition of the Greek akolouthia. It is a work by Venetian engraver Isabella Piccini.

New saw mills appeared in Marine and Stillwater. Lumber was typically cut during winter and sent downstream in the spring.

5|$|Two extinct flightless {{species of}} rail were {{at one time}} placed in the genus Atlantisia with the Inaccessible Island rail.

In 1973 Olson synonymised the genus Aphanocrex with the genus Atlantisia, and described the Ascension crake as being congeneric. Today they are considered to have evolved independently (with A. podarces probably not even being closely related), and in 2003 the genus Mundia was erected and <b>the</b> <b>Saint</b> Helena swamphen moved back to Aphanocrex, leaving the Inaccessible Island rail the only species in the genus Atlantisia.
