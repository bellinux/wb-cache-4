All senators had to speak before a vote could be held, and since all meetings had to end by nightfall, a senator could talk a proposal to death (a filibuster or diem consumere) if they could keep the debate going until nightfall. It is known, for example, that the senator Cato the Younger once filibustered {{in an attempt to}} prevent the Senate from granting Julius Caesar a law that would have given land to the veterans of Pompey.|$|E
25|$|A {{short time}} later, detectives from the RHD {{who had been}} {{selected}} for their lack of personal connection to Lazarus called her one morning from the lockup at Parker Center, the department's headquarters. Bratton had ordered that location be used since Lazarus would have to surrender her gun in order to enter it, limiting the possibility she might resist violently when she was arrested (immediately following the interview, as was the plan) or {{realized that she was}} the prime suspect. The detectives, Greg Stearns and Dan Jaramillo, told her they had someone in custody who wanted to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> art theft.|$|E
25|$|Excavations in the Altiplano Cundiboyacense (the {{highlands}} of Cundinamarca and Boyacá departments) show evidence {{of human activity}} since the Archaic stage {{at the beginning of}} the Holocene era. Colombia has one of the most ancient archaeological sites of the Americas: El Abra, which is estimated to be approximately 13,000 years old. Other archaeological traces in the region of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense have led scholars to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> El Abra Culture: In Tibitó, tools and other lithic artifacts date to 9740 BCE; on the Bogotá savanna, especially at Tequendama Falls, other lithic tools dated a millennium later were found that belonged to specialized hunters. Human skeletons were found that date to 5000 BCE. Analysis demonstrated that the people were members of the El Abra Culture.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{will analyze}} {{the use of}} the ﬁrst person pronoun “Watashi ha” and “Watashi φ” in conversations about “personal matters”. With {{reference}} to Kushida. s (2006) procedures in the opening of “personal matters talk”, in this paper I will present the following six ways of openings: <b>a)</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> new “personal matter” when inserting reason description/explanation, b) <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> common experience as an example, c) emphasizing a contrasting experience as an example, d) creating <b>an</b> opportunity to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> one. s own experience, e) <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> “personal matter” as a topic change, f) <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> “personal matter” as a response. Moreover, I will analyze the frequency of “Watashi ha” and “Watashi φ” in each of the openings. The ﬁndings showed that “Watashi φ” can be used in most of the cases. However, in the case of c) emphasizing a contrasting experience as an example and f) <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> “personal matter” as a response, the use of “Watashi ha” is preferred...|$|R

2500|$|The term {{psycholinguistics}} {{was coined}} in 1936 by Jacob Robert Kantor {{in his book}} An Objective Psychology of Grammar and started being used among his team at Indiana University, but its use finally became frequent thanks to the 1946 article [...] "Language and psycholinguistics: a review," [...] by his student Nicholas Henry Pronko.

2500|$|The {{parameter}} [...] {{represents the}} item location which, {{in the case}} of attainment testing, {{is referred to as the}} item difficulty. It is the point on [...] where the IRF has its maximum slope, and where the value is half-way between the minimum value of [...] and the maximum value of 1. The example item is of medium difficulty since =0.0, which is near the center of the distribution. Note that this model scales the item's difficulty and the person's trait onto the same continuum. Thus, it is valid to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> item being about as hard as Person A's trait level or of a person's trait level being about the same as Item Y's difficulty, in the sense that successful performance of the task involved with an item reflects a specific level of ability.|$|E

60|$|It is true {{there is}} much loose <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> overruling Providence; and yet, if fairly stated, the belief of a great many Christians might be thus expressed: God has {{organized}} and set in operation certain general laws of matter and mind, which work out the particular results of life, and over these laws he exercises a general supervision and care, {{so that all the}} great affairs of the world are carried on after the counsel of his own will; and in a certain general sense, all things are working together for good to those that love God. But when some simple-minded, childlike Christian really proceeds to refer all the smaller events of life to God's immediate care and agency, there is a smile of incredulity, and it is thought that the good brother displays more Christian feeling than sound philosophy.|$|E
