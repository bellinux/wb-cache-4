5|$|On 27 December 2011, presidential {{spokesman}} Alfredo Scoccimaro {{announced that}} Kirchner {{had been diagnosed}} with thyroid cancer on 22 December and that she would undergo surgery on 4 January 2012. The standard procedure in these operations is to expose the thyroid gland so that a pathologist can <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample,</b> analyze it looking for carcinogenic cells, and then decide whether it needs to be removed. In Kirchner's case, this step was omitted and the gland was removed directly. After the operation, it was revealed that she had been misdiagnosed and did not have cancer. On 5 October 2013, doctors ordered Kirchner to rest for a month after they found blood on her brain caused by a head injury she received on 8 August 2012. She was re-admitted to hospital and had successful surgery on 8 October 2013 to remove blood from under a membrane covering her brain.|$|E

He persuades her to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> of Castor's blood {{and his own}} to compare their blood types at the hospital where she works to prove he is Sean. Convinced of her husband's identity, she tells him that Castor will be vulnerable at Lazarro's funeral. At the ceremony, Sean finds that Castor has anticipated his actions and takes Eve hostage. Sasha arrives, and a gunfight ensues; Sasha manages to save Eve after taking a bullet. Before she dies, Sean promises {{to take care of}} Adam for her and not allow him to grow up with a life of crime.|$|E
25|$|Four {{explosion}}s {{were clearly}} detected. The fourth explosion {{was so strong}} that the stern of the Cuban ship was submerged and water came in through the hatchway of the engine room. At that time the hydrophones reported a sound similar to a liquid bubbling when it comes from a submerged container that is suddenly opened. The sounds indicated that the U-boat had been hit. To finish the U-boat off, the patrol boat launched two more depth charges, set to explode at 250 feet. A few minutes later, a dark stain was observed {{on the surface of the}} water. A spurt of a black and viscous substance smelling like gasoline came up from the deep. Although there was little doubt that the U-boat had been sunk, Delgado was ordered to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> of the contaminated seawater to confirm the victory. But even then it wasn't until after the war, when the Allies seized Germany's naval records, that proof of U-176s sinking was found. According to the seized documents, U-176 was under the command of Captain Lieutenant Reiner Dierksen, had sunk eleven enemy ships in her career, and was herself sunk with all hands lost.|$|E

500|$|By plan, the {{following}} summer, {{the team was}} to drill down again to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> of that ice and analyze it. The Russians resumed drilling into the lake in January 2012 and reached the upper {{surface of the water}} on 6 February 2012. [...] The researchers allowed the rushing lake water to freeze within the bore hole and months later, they collected ice core samples of this newly formed ice and sent to the Laboratory for Glaciology and Environmental Geophysics in Grenoble, France, for analysis.|$|E

500|$|At the Enclave base at Raven Rock, the Lone Wanderer is {{freed from}} their cell by the Enclave leader, President John Henry Eden, who {{requests}} a private audience with them, but Colonel Autumn defies Eden's orders, takes {{command of the}} Enclave's military, and orders the Lone Wanderer to be shot on sight. Despite the setback, the Wanderer meets with Eden who is revealed to be a sentient ZAX series supercomputer that {{took control of the}} Enclave after President Dick Richardson was killed off the West Coast. Seeking to repeat Richardson's plans, Eden reveals his intentions of using Project Purity to infect the water with a modified strain of FEV that will make it toxic to any mutated life, thus killing off most life in the wasteland including humans. The Enclave, who would be immune to the effects because of their genetic [...] "purity" [...] {{as a result of their}} isolation, would be free to take control of the area. Forced to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> of the new FEV, the Wanderer leaves the base, regardless of doing so peacefully or convincing Eden to self-destruct. Returning to the Citadel, where news of the Enclave's possession of the G.E.C.K. is known to the Brotherhood, the Lone Wanderer joins them in an assault on the Jefferson Memorial, which is spearheaded through the use of a giant, military robot named Liberty Prime. Reaching the control room and dealing with Colonel Autumn, where the player has the choice to either convince Autumn to leave or they can kill him, Li informs the Wanderer that the purifier is now ready for activation, but that the code must be inputted manually within the control room, meaning whoever goes in would be subjected to lethal amounts of radiation. To make matters worse, the purifier has been damaged and will self-destruct if not activated.|$|E

30|$|To {{exploit the}} duality, a new {{learning}} scheme which involves two tasks—a primal task and its dual task—can be formulated. The primal task <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> from space X as input and maps to space Y, and the dual task <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> from space Y as input and maps to space X. Using {{the language of}} probability, the primal task learns a conditional distribution P(y|x;θxy) parameterized by θxy, and the dual task learns a conditional distribution P(x|y;θyx) parameterized by θyx, where x∈X and y∈Y. In the new scheme, the dual tasks are jointly learned and their structural relationship is exploited to improve the learning effectiveness.|$|R

For this was a serious, vital, all-comprehending matter; devil-worship, a thing not to be tolerated one moment longer than you could by any method help!

60|$|Then {{first let}} us <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> case and suppose {{yourself}} to be an elementary teacher. So far as your work went you would be very much as you are to-day; {{you would have a}} finer and more beautiful school-room perhaps, better supplied with apparatus and diagrams; you would have cleaner and healthier, that is to say brighter and more responsive children, and you would have smaller and more manageable classes. Schools will be very important things in the Socialist State, and you will find outside your class-room a much ampler building with open corridors, a library, a bath, refectory for the children's midday meal, and gymnasium, and beyond the playground a garden. You will be an enlisted member of a public service, free under reasonable conditions to resign, liable under extreme circumstances to dismissal for misconduct, but entitled until you do so to a minimum salary, a maintenance allowance, that is, and to employment. You will have had a general education from the State up to the age of sixteen or seventeen, and then three or four years of sound technical training, so that you will know your work from top to bottom. You will have applied for your present position in the service, whatever it is, and have been accepted, much as you apply and are accepted for positions now, by the school managers, and you will have done so because it attracted you and they will have accepted you because your qualifications seemed adequate to them. You will draw a salary attached to the position, over and above that minimum maintenance salary to which I have already alluded. You will be working just as keenly as you are now, and better because of the better training you have had, and because of shorter hours and more invigorating conditions, and you will be working for much the same ends, that is to say for promotion to a larger salary and wider opportunities and for the interest and sake of the work. In your leisure you may be studying, writing, or doing some work of supererogation for the school or the State--because under Socialist conditions it cannot be too clearly understood that all the reasons the contemporary Trade Unionist finds against extra work and unpaid work will have disappeared! You will not in a Socialist State make life harder for others by working keenly and doing much if you are so disposed. You will be free to give yourself generously to your work. You will have no anxiety about sickness or old age, the State, the universal Friendly Society, will hold you secure against that; but if you like to provide extra luxury and dignity for your declining years, if you think you will be amused to collect prints or books, or travel then, or run a rose garden or grow chrysanthemums, the State will be quite ready for you to pay it an insurance premium in order that you may receive in due course an extra annuity to serve that end you contemplate.|$|E
