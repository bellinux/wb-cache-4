These arguments are formalized in an analytical model that jointly considers {{the benefits and}} costs of acquisition {{as a function of}} target capability level and context. The predictions from this model are tested in the Chinese Brewing industry (1998 - 2007), with results showing that acquirers strongly prefer inferior <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> existing geographic markets, but are relatively more likely to choose superior <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> new markets, especially if they have strong acquisition capabilities.
