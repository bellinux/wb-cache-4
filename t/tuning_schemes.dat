The first topic is a digital <b>tuning</b> <b>scheme</b> for digitally programmable integrated continuous-time filters (4), (8) - (10). Emphasis of this research is on development of a more general <b>tuning</b> <b>scheme</b> which can be applicable to various filter functions as well as high-frequency applications. The <b>tuning</b> <b>scheme</b> consists of two phases: system identification and adjustment. Various continuous-time filter identification methods including time-domain and frequency-domain approaches are investigated, and a filter adjustment algorithm is presented. Potential of high accuracy of the proposed <b>tuning</b> <b>scheme</b> and successful applicability to high-frequency filters with versatile functions have been demonstrated through simulations and experiments;Four other topics are separately presented. First, nonidealities associated with high-precision amplifiers (5), (7) are discussed. Special emphasis is given on analysis of statistical characteristics of random CMRR and offset of CMOS op-amps which can help estimating yield of high-volume production and help engineers design for a given yield. Next, an automatic offset compensation scheme for CMOS op-amps with ping-pong control (2), (6) is presented. A very low-voltage circuit design technique using floating gate MOSFETs (3) is introduced. Finally, an accurate and matching-free threshold voltage extraction scheme using a ratio-independent SC amplifier and a dynamic current mirror (1) is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Most of the {{existing}} PID parameters tuning methods are only effective with pre-known accurate system models, which often require some strict identification experiments and thus infeasible for many complicated systems. Actually, in most practical engineering applications, it is desirable for the PID <b>tuning</b> <b>scheme</b> to be directly based on the input-output response of the closed-loop system. Thus, a new parameter <b>tuning</b> <b>scheme</b> for PID controllers without explicit mathematical model is developed in this paper. The paper begins with a new frequency domain properties analysis of the PID controller. After that, the definition of characteristic frequency for the PID controller is given in order to study the mathematical relationship between the PID parameters and the open-loop frequency properties of the controlled system. Then, the concepts of M-field and theta-field are introduced, which are then used {{to explain how the}} PID control parameters influence the closed-loop frequency-magnitude property and its time responses. Subsequently, the new PID parameter <b>tuning</b> <b>scheme,</b> i. e., a group of tuning rules, is proposed based on the preceding analysis. Finally, both simulations and experiments are conducted, and the results verify the feasibility and validity of the proposed methods. This research proposes a PID parameter tuning method based on outputs of the closed loop system...|$|R
40|$|An 80 MHz {{bandpass}} filter with a tunable quality factor of 16 ∼ 44 using an improved transconductor circuit is presented. A noise optimized biquad structure for high-Q, high- frequency {{bandpass filter}} is proposed. The quality factor of the filter is tuned {{using a new}} quality factor locked loop algorithm. It was shown that a second-order quality factor locked loop is necessary and sufficient to tune the quality factor of a bandpass filter with zero steady state error. The accuracy, mismatch, and sensitivty analysis of the new <b>tuning</b> <b>scheme</b> was performed and analyzed. Based on the proposed noise optimized filter structure and new quality factor <b>tuning</b> <b>scheme,</b> a biquad filter was designed and fabricated in 0. 25 μm BiCMOS process.

50|$|This {{is a list}} of the {{absolute}} frequencies in hertz (cycles per second) of the keys of a modern 88-key standard or 102-key extended piano in twelve-tone equal temperament, with the 49th key, the fifth A (called A4), tuned to 440 Hz (referred to as A440). Each successive pitch is derived by multiplying (ascending) or dividing (descending) the previous by the twelfth root of two (approximately 1.05946). For example, to get the frequency a semitone up from A4 (A4), multiply 440 by the twelfth root of two. To go from A4 to B4 (up a whole tone, or two semitones), multiply 440 twice by the twelfth root of two (or just by the sixth root of two, approximately 1.12246).

In addition, IFT is also optimal with respect to the presence of noise, whereas the other schemes are designed for noise-free conditions. The IFT method used here is a variant of the initial IFT scheme, in which no weighting is applied to the control error during a time window that corresponds to the transient response, and where the lenght of this window is progressively reduced.

40|$|An eigenstructure-based {{performance}} index is proposed {{in this paper}} to measure the dynamic performance of the system as well as control efforts. Calculation of this index is based on eigenstructure of the closed loop system and the design parameters; it does not rely on control structures. Therefore, this index can be applied for solving structurally constrained control problems. A <b>tuning</b> <b>scheme</b> based on this index is proposed for coordinating power system stabilizers (PSSs) and supplementary damping controllers (SDCs) for flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices to damp inter-area oscillations of systems and to optimize their control efforts under multiple operating conditions. Both PSSs and SDCs utilize control structures as a low order single-input-single-output phase lead-lag compensator. Wide-area signals are employed to upgrade their effectiveness in damping inter-area oscillations.
