40|$|The {{research}} was conducted at Bukit Soeharto, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. In the natural forests there were as many sound as diseased trees. There were no clear differences in disease incidence among forests with different intensities of cutting and among different diameter classes. Observations were made on 49 trees of 15 species in sample plots. Among them only Dipterocarpus convertus, D. cornutus, Shorea leprosula, S. ovalis and S. seminis remained sound. Stem canker was judged {{to be the most}} dangerous disease. Invasion of disease in uncut forest (control) was low level compared with cutting treatments, but difference of disease invasion between the forests with different cutting intensities was not clear because of low numbers of sample trees. Sound trees should be preferred to diseased trees for seed trees. In the <b>taungya</b> <b>plantation</b> there were generally more sound plants of all species compared to diseased and dead ones, except for Manihot esculenta and Glycine max which were more diseased than sound. Leaf spots were found in all species of plants. Among the forestry plants, the highest incidence of leaf spot disease occurred in Hevea brasiliensis and among the agricultural plants, the highest incidence was in G. max. Generally, invasion of diseases in M. esculenta and G. max caused moderate damage, while other species had a low level of damage. Mixed planting in the taungya system presents no problem from disease viewpoint because of the specificity of the diseases...|$|E
40|$|The Nordic nations {{contribute}} {{greatly to}} Third World development but unless aid programmes {{can be sustained}} in economic, social and environmental terms by the recipients themselves they will, in the long run, have been useless. The mayor Nordic bilateral aid agencies chose 14 of their successful projects which had obvious environmental spin-offs, and commissioned a journalist from each country concerned to make an independent report - the first known uncensored evaluation of donor nations' work - at the Nordic Conference on Environment and Development at Saltsjobaden, Stockholm, in May 1987. The result is Towards Sustainable Development, a set of 14 studies, funded by SIDA and published by Panos. Although the views {{are those of the}} authors, the donors have been permitted marginal comments. The studies cover the questions that people actually on the ground are asking: who should repair the leaks in a drinking-water pipeline - trained mechanics or unskilled villagers? Where can nomad women find firewood for their bakery without furthering deforestation? How can a huge pulp mill fit into a peasant environment? Freelance Sri Lankan Journalist Mallika Wanigasundara's report of a NORAD-backed project in Hambantota, which helps peasants with loans for houses and seed, new wells, restoring tanks, <b>taungya</b> <b>plantations</b> and cookstoves, exemplifies the theme that emerges strongly from all 14 cases - that even with mas sive external aid and a less unjust distribution of the world's wealth, each recipient country must find a way of sustaining development on its own. Locally there has been considerable support for the Hanbantota programme, which has adapted Buddhist environmental traditions, perhaps - as Wanigasundara's title 'Farming with Ahimsa' suggested - because the Buddha's doctrine of non-violence to plants has taken a firm root in this region. But nonetheless crops are often trampled and water tanks damaged by animals and, if the NORAD aid scheme is to achieve long-term success, community involvement must be improved. Among the subjects covered were: marginal soil, marginal farms (Kenya); glaciers of the desert (Mauritania); why Kenyans save their soil (Kenya); research for peasant farmers (Tanzania); trees for the poor (Orissa, India); managing a forest (Tanzania); in a dry land (Turkana, Kenya); farming with Ahimsa (Sri Lanka); piped water by the people (Malawi); paper at a price (Tanzania); Mtera Dam (Tanzania) and waging war on rice pests (Bangladesh). Such independent Third World critiques must be fundamental to a complete understanding of how development can be sustainable.
