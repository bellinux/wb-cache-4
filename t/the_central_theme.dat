5|$|Aravan {{is known}} as Kuttantavar in the {{religious}} sect which bears his name, and {{in which he is}} the chief deity. His main temple is in Koovagam, Tamil Nadu. Here, the marriage of Aravan and Mohini, Krishna's female form, and her widowhood and mourning, after Aravan's sacrifice, forms <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>theme</b> of an 18-day annual festival either side of the night of the full moon in the Tamil month of Cittirai (April–May). The day of the full moon is the central day of the festival, when Aravan's sacrifice is ritually re-enacted.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the writing}} of vachana poems went into decline after {{the passing of the}} Basavanna era in the late 12th century, latter day vachanakaras such as Tontada Siddhesavara (or Siddhalinga Yati), a noted Shaiva saint and guru of King Virupaksha RayaII, started a revival. He wrote Shatsthala Jnanamrita (1540), a {{collection}} of 700 poems. In 1560, Virakta Tontadarya made the life of Tontada Siddhesavara <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>theme</b> in his writing Siddhesvara Purana. Virakta Tontadarya, Gummalapura Siddhalinga, Swatantra Siddhalingeshwara (1560) and Ghanalingideva (1560) are some well-known vachana poets who tried to recreate the glory days of the early poets, though the socio-political expediency did not exist.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the novel}} uses fantastic elements, its main focus is a {{realistic}} {{portrayal of the}} excesses of bourgeois materialism. Balzac's renowned attention to detail is used to describe a gambling house, an antique shop, a royal banquet, and other locales. He also includes details from his own life as a struggling writer, placing the main character in a home {{similar to the one}} he occupied at the start of his literary career. <b>The</b> <b>central</b> <b>theme</b> of La Peau de chagrin is the conflict between desire and longevity. The magic skin represents the owner's life-force, which is depleted through every expression of will, especially when it is employed for the acquisition of power. Ignoring a caution from the shopkeeper who offers him the skin, the protagonist greedily surrounds himself with wealth, only to find himself miserable and decrepit at the story's end.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the most}} famous of these bird artists was John James Audubon, whose {{paintings}} of North American birds were a great commercial success in Europe and who later lent his name to the National Audubon Society. Birds are also important figures in poetry; for example, Homer incorporated nightingales into his Odyssey, and Catullus used a sparrow as an erotic symbol in his Catullus 2. The relationship between an albatross and a sailor is <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>theme</b> of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which led {{to the use of the}} term as a metaphor for a 'burden'. Other English metaphors derive from birds; vulture funds and vulture investors, for instance, take their name from the scavenging vulture.|$|E
5|$|D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's {{most famous}} work, On Growth and Form {{was written in}} Dundee, mostly in 1915, but {{publication}} was put off until 1917 because of the delays of wartime and Thompson's many late alterations to the text. <b>The</b> <b>central</b> <b>theme</b> {{of the book is}} that biologists of its author's day overemphasized evolution as the fundamental determinant of the form and structure of living organisms, and underemphasized the roles of physical laws and mechanics. At a time when vitalism was still being considered as a biological theory, he advocated structuralism as an alternative to natural selection in governing the form of species, with the smallest hint of vitalism as the unseen driving force.|$|E
5|$|The {{tolerance}} of violence within mainstream American culture is <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>theme</b> of the record, which takes a {{critical look at}} the roles gun culture, conservative American Christianity, and traditional family values play in the glorification of violence. A substantive portion of the album analyzes the cultural role of Jesus Christ, specifically Manson's view {{that the image of}} his crucifixion became the origin of celebrity. Manson said that while his previous work argued against the credibility of the Bible's content, for the purpose of Holy Wood, he instead looked for things in the Bible to which he could relate. He developed an opinion that Christ was a revolutionary figure—a person who was killed for having dangerous opinions, and whose image was later exploited and merchandised for financial gain by entities such as the Vatican.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Madonna {{collaborated with}} {{photographer}} Steven Klein for an art installation project called X-Static Process. The installation portrayed Madonna in different incarnations of her spiritual practices– from yogi, prophet, queen to freak and pole dancer. The publication was a worldwide success, {{leading to a}} number of exhibitions in New York, London, Paris, Düsseldorf, Berlin and Florence. After the exhibition was over, Madonna was inspired by the images from the exhibitions and decided to incorporate them into her then unplanned tour and asked Klein to help her with the task. She then began developing her sixth concert tour called Re-Invention World Tour. The poster released for the tour used one of the images from the installation project. It featured Madonna in a seventeenth-century-style dress, crawling on all fours towards the camera. <b>The</b> <b>central</b> <b>theme</b> of the show was unity versus violence. It was divided into five acts with different themes: French Baroque-Marie Antionette Revival, Military-Army, Circus-Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal segments. During the Q Awards, Elton John accused Madonna for lip-synching in her shows which gained great controversy but was denied by Madonna's representatives. Although musician Prince's Musicology Live 2004ever tour was initially projected to be the highest grossing tour of 2004, Billboard Boxscore published that the Re-Invention Tour had sold 55 out of the 56 shows and grossed $125 million. At the 2004 Billboard Touring Awards, Re-Invention Tour received the Top Tour while Madonna's tour manager Caresse Henry was awarded the Top Manager award. A documentary, titled I'm Going to Tell You a Secret, which chronicled the tour, was released in 2005.|$|E

In this paper, we argue that Distributed Situation Awareness (DSA) is an important construct in pilotage as the information required to carry out operations is distributed between agents and artefacts.
