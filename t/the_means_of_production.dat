5|$|The basic {{principles}} of New Labour existed in the post-war socialist revisionism of Anthony Crosland. Crosland emphasised that Labour should not just focus on nationalisation and social welfare, but attempt to reform education, resolve wealth inequality, and pursue better industrial relations. His work The Future of Socialism stressed the idea that socialism is moral and should pursue liberty, fellowship, social justice, and equality. This required the redistribution of wealth through a progressive tax system, rendering public ownership of <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> enshrined in Clause IV of Labour's constitution, unnecessary. Crosland also proposed that education reform allow greater egalitarianism, proposing {{the abolition of the}} eleven plus exam.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisation}} {{of society}} depends on means of production. Literally, those things, like land, {{natural resources and}} technology, necessary {{for the production of}} material goods and the relations of production. In other words, the social relationships people enter into as they acquire and use <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> Together, these compose the mode of production and Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of distinct modes of production. Marx differentiated between base and superstructure, with the base (or substructure) referring to the economic system and superstructure, to the cultural and political system. Marx regarded this mismatch between (economic) base and (social) superstructure as a major source of social disruption and conflict.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: There is a {{neglected}} {{part of the}} socialist calculation debate- public ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>productions</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> elimination <b>of</b> stock and other financial markets, and the payment of social dividends instead of private dividends (and other private investment income). The substitution of social dividends for private dividends means that investment projects {{will be based on}} central planning, rather than entrepreneurial calculations. Participants {{on both sides of the}} interwar debate over socialism agreed social dividend payment prevents economic calculation of the returns on investment projects, while also causing bureaucratization. Postwar critics of market socialism of the calculation debate have overlooked the issues of social dividend payment and investment determination. This paper reevaluates the interwar debate, and examines John Roemer’s proposal for a socialist stock market...|$|R
5|$|Marx's {{theories}} about society, economics and politics—collectively understood as Marxism—hold that human societies develop through class struggle. In capitalism, this {{manifests itself in}} {{the conflict between the}} ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour power in return for wages. Employing a critical approach known as historical materialism, Marx predicted that, like previous socioeconomic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system: socialism. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism, owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature, would eventuate the working class' development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers. Marx actively fought for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.|$|E
5|$|Karl Marx {{distinguished}} {{social classes}} by their connection to <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> in the capitalist system: the bourgeoisie own the means, but this effectively includes the proletariat {{itself as the}} workers can only sell their own labour power (forming the material base of the cultural superstructure). Max Weber critiqued Marxist economic determinism, arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities, but on other status and power differentials (e.g. patriarchy). According to Weber, stratification may occur among at least three complex variables: (1) Property (class): A person's economic position in a society, based on birth and individual achievement. Weber differs from Marx in {{that he does not}} see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own; Marx would have placed such a person in the proletariat. (2) Prestige (status): A person's prestige, or popularity in a society. This could be determined by the kind of job this person does or wealth. and (3) Power (political party): A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a member of the United States Congress, may hold little property or status but they still hold immense power Pierre Bourdieu provides a modern example in the concepts of cultural and symbolic capital. Theorists such as Ralf Dahrendorf have noted the tendency towards an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service-based economies. Perspectives concerning globalization, such as dependency theory, suggest this effect owes to the shift of workers to the developing countries.|$|E

For the collectivization of <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> Once collectivization takes place, money would be abolished to be replaced with labour notes and workers' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on job difficulty and the amount of time they contributed to production.

40|$|One of {{the most}} enchanting areas in {{economics}} is the forward thinking. While Malthus and Ricardo agreed on the gloomy vision of the future, Mill described the wider stationary state and foresaw it in a more optimistic way.

This article incorporates this knowledge into economics.

25|$|Socialists {{attribute}} the vast disparities in wealth {{to the private}} ownership of <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> by a class of owners, creating a situation where {{a small portion of}} the population lives off unearned property income by virtue of ownership titles in capital equipment, financial assets and corporate stock.

25|$|Another {{strand of}} {{opposition}} to Malthus's ideas started {{in the middle of}} the 19th century with the writings of Friedrich Engels (Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy, 1844) and Karl Marx (Capital, 1867). Engels and Marx argued that what Malthus saw as the problem of the pressure of population on <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> actually represented the pressure of <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> on population. They thus viewed it in terms of their concept of the reserve army of labour.

40|$|An {{examination}} of neoclassical economic theory is undertaken from the van-tage point of Marx’s theoretical stance termed “the illusion of the epoch”, {{found in his}} and Friedrich Engels writings collected as The German Ideology. The “Illusion ” is a conceptual framework in which {{the ideas of the}} dominant economic class are the dominant ideas in society and increasingly present themselves as both abstract and universal. Thus, for example, the term “free-dom ” in capitalist society is put forth independent of social context but is understood to refer to “bourgeois freedom ” as in fee markets, free enterprise and so on. In this essay, I evaluate neoclassical theory in terms of its claims to universality, demonstrating the methodological foundation on which such a claim is erected, and show the increasingly abstract, non-social nature of the theory as it develops from its 19 th century origins through the current peri-od. It is demonstrated that this theoretical approach promotes a perspective in which proper theory is akin to natural law; rests on a hypothetical individ-ual undertaking subjectivist calculation; exists independent of societal rela-tions; is independent of time and place, thus of a universalist nature. Neoclassical theory, that is, is consistent with Marx’s “illusion”. (J. E. L. : A 14; B 10; B 40) In The German Ideology, Marx and Engels put forward a proposition regarding the general principle upon which a ruling class rules: “The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas [...] . The class which has <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> material <b>production</b> at its disposal [...] . also controls <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> mental <b>production,</b> so that the ideas of those who lack <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> mental <b>production</b> are on the whole subject to it [...] The ruling ideas are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relations, the domi-nant relations grasped as ideas [...] .
