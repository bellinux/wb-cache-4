5|$|The Glorious First of June {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problems</b> inherent in the French and British navies {{at the start of}} the Revolutionary Wars. Both admirals were faced with disobedience from their captains, along with ill-discipline and poor training among their shorthanded crews, and they failed to control their fleets effectively during the height of the combat.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} {{following}} the Japanese surrender, the Giyugun (PETA) and Heiho groups were disbanded by the Japanese. Command structures and membership vital {{for a national}} army were consequently dismantled. Thus, rather than being formed from a trained, armed, and organised army, the Republican armed forces began to grow in September from usually younger, less trained groups built around charismatic leaders. Creating a rational military structure that was obedient to central authority from such disorganisation, was one of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problems</b> of the revolution, a problem that remains through to contemporary times. In the self-created Indonesian army, Japanese-trained Indonesian officers prevailed over those trained by the Dutch. A thirty-year-old former school teacher, Sudirman, was elected 'commander-in-chief' at {{the first meeting of}} Division Commanders in Yogyakarta on 12 November 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Polish Second Army {{consisted}} of five infantry divisions: (5th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th, the 1st Armored Corps, and smaller units), about 84,000–90,000 men, and 500 tanks. Many {{of them were}} new recruits inexperienced in combat, incorporated from the recently retaken Polish territories. The quality of the officer corps has also been questioned. One of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problems</b> facing the People's Army was lack of a qualified cadre; a 1944 estimate showed that the army had one officer for each 1,200 soldiers. Many of the officers in the Polish Army were Soviet officers of Polish descent.|$|E

25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problems</b> in {{classifying}} {{and identifying}} komatiite-hosted NiS ore deposits as Kambalda type is the structural complication and overprint of metamorphism upon the volcanic morphology and textures of the ore deposit.|$|E
25|$|The {{theft of}} {{bicycles}} {{is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problems</b> that slow the development of urban cycling. Bicycle theft discourages regular cyclists from buying new bicycles, as well as putting off people {{who might want to}} invest in a bicycle.|$|E
25|$|According to critics, one of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problems</b> {{with the}} embargo {{is that the}} United States is the only major country that has such an embargo against Cuba in place. Cuba still {{receives}} tourists and trade from other countries making the embargo appear both illegitimate and pointless.|$|E

25|$|In 1950, Alan Turing {{proposed}} a general procedure {{to test the}} intelligence of an agent {{now known as the}} Turing test. This procedure allows almost all <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problems</b> of artificial intelligence to be tested. However, it is a very difficult challenge and at present all agents fail.|$|E
25|$|There are now several {{countries}} which have implemented direct {{job creation schemes}} to counter <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problems</b> associated with persistent unemployment. For example, the Argentine government introduced the Jefes de Hogar (Heads of Households) program in 2001 to combat the social malaise that followed the financial crisis in that year.|$|E
25|$|On 15 March 1517, the Fifth Council of the Lateran {{closed its}} {{activities}} {{with a number}} of reform proposals (on the selection of bishops, taxation, censorship and preaching) but not on <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problems</b> that confronted the Church in Germany and other parts of Europe. A few months later, on 31 October 1517, Martin Luther issued his 95 Theses in Wittenberg.|$|E
50|$|These {{forces were}} {{cut off from the}} Reich but {{occasionally}} ships or U-Boats reached the Port to replenish supplies. Food was <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> to those Axis Forces within the Lorient Pocket.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to shaft}} depth, <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> with <b>the</b> mine {{throughout}} its life was water ingress, with a reported maximum ingress during its operational life of 1000 imp gal entering the pit every minute.|$|R
50|$|Natural {{gases and}} gases given {{off as a}} result of explosions could ignite, poison or asphyxiate. <b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> gas for tunnellers was carbon monoxide, given off by all {{projectiles}} from shells to rifle bullets.|$|R
25|$|In the 2007 election, Le Pen and her {{substitute}} Steeve Briois {{stood for}} the FN in the Pas-de-Calais' 14th constituency, Hénin-Beaumont, a former coal mining area with high unemployment. Le Pen commented that with unemployment, offshoring and insecurity, the constituency was symbolic of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problems</b> of France. Le Pen's campaign committee {{was led by}} Daniel Janssens, a former socialist deputy mayor of Leforest for 24 years.|$|E
25|$|Washington also {{established}} {{itself as the}} leader of continental defense through the creation of the Inter-American Defense Board in 1942 and the signing of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance in 1947. A parallel development was the founding in 1950 of the Centro de Altos Estudios Militares (CAEM, Center of High Military Studies) for the formation of officers in <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problems</b> of the nation beyond those related to its military defense.|$|E
25|$|By {{the summer}} of 1942 it {{appeared}} most of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problems</b> had been solved, and a new lab {{under the direction of}} E.A. Luebke was set up to develop a working system. The Army Air Force, long a proponent of precision bombing but finding themselves unable to deliver on their promises in combat, placed high hopes on the system's ability to attack pinpoint targets, pressing for its development in spite of other systems like H2X already beginning to enter production.|$|E
25|$|The {{projects}} were not launched {{for fear of}} losing too much money and conviction of the human impossibility to dig such a canal. <b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> was how to supply the summit sections with enough water.|$|R

50|$|Honesty of {{response}} may be <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> with <b>the</b> self-report personality tests. Test questions are often transparent, {{and people can}} usually {{figure out how to}} respond to make themselves appear to possess whatever qualities they think the organization wants.|$|R
25|$|After {{teaching}} {{theology and}} Eastern religions at the University of Dayton, Griffin came {{to appreciate the}} distinctively postmodern aspects of Whitehead's thought. In particular, Griffin found Whitehead's nonsensationist epistemology and panexperientialist ontology immensely helpful in addressing <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problems</b> of modern philosophy, including the problems of mind-body interaction, the interaction between free and determined things, the emergence of experience from nonexperiencing matter, {{and the emergence of}} time in the evolutionary process. In 1973, Griffin returned to Claremont to establish, with Cobb, the Center for Process Studies at the Claremont School of Theology.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 1950, <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problems</b> meriting medical {{research}} were declared to be tuberculosis, traumatism, occupational diseases and dysentery. In {{comparison to the}} war years, birth rate had increased, mortality (including infant mortality) decreased, and the birth rate again exceeded the death rate. Despite the immense needs for research, the Faculty of Medicine at the Tartu State University (now University of Tartu) suffered from major purges, culminating after March 1950. Altogether, 56 staff of the university were purged; in the Faculty of Medicine, 12 professors of 17 were removed from their positions. They were replaced with less skilled but politically reliable staff.|$|E
25|$|Operation Barga (and West Bengal's land {{reforms in}} general) {{have been criticized}} for their small scope and {{inability}} to solve all <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problems.</b> This criticism has been mainly due to policies not accounting for the high landmass-population ratio in Bengal (the highest in the country), the small and highly segregated land holding patterns and failure of the Government to develop agri-industrial markets for farm produce. These failures, critics contend, have distributed poverty rather than creating prosperity. They point out that in spite of these measures, Bengal’s agricultural infrastructure and financial situation is no better than in most other states.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> was {{inadequate}} flood passage capacity of barrage {{in relation to}} flood intensities developed over a 100-year return period. The aging process along with inadequate/deferred maintenance had contributed to a general deterioration of different components of the structure.|$|R
5000|$|Improvisation: Music From The Inside Out was {{published}} in 1988. The New York Times said it offers helpful advice but [...] "it skirts <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> of an art that demands both a free-flying spirit and the heavy weight of discipline".|$|R
25|$|Voltage {{regulators}} {{are used in}} devices like air conditioners, refrigerators, televisions etc. {{in order to protect}} them from fluctuating input voltage. <b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> faced is <b>the</b> use of relays in voltage regulators. Relays create sparks which result in faults in the product.|$|R
25|$|Unemployment {{is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problems</b> of Assam {{which can}} be {{attributed}} to overpopulation, and a faulty education system. Every year, large numbers of students obtain higher academic degrees but because of non-availability of proportional vacancies, most of these students remain unemployed. A number of employers hire over-qualified or efficient, but under-certified, candidates, or candidates with narrowly-defined qualifications. The problem is exacerbated by the {{growth in the number of}} technical institutes in Assam which increases the unemployed community of the State. Many job-seekers are ineligible for jobs in sectors like Railways, and Oil India by the appointment of candidates from outside Assam to those posts.|$|E
25|$|The InterCity 125 {{is still}} in {{widespread}} use. First Great Western planned to supplement (but not replace) its InterCity 125s with 14 Class 180 Adelante trains, which can travel at the same speed. Because every carriage has an underfloor engine, they can accelerate approximately twice as quickly, which reduces journey times and allows for more frequent services. However, in-car noise levels are {{higher than in the}} InterCity 125 because of the underfloor engines, which, combined with less-comfortable seats and harsh interior lighting, has made them unpopular with passengers. They also proved to be unreliable, leading to a significant overhaul programme in 2004 to fix <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problems.</b> These issues ultimately led to the units being withdrawn from First Great Western services and transferred to open access operators Grand Central and Hull Trains.|$|E
25|$|During the 1770s, Blake {{had come}} to feel that one of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problems</b> with {{reproducing}} artwork in print was the division of labour by which it was achieved; one person would create a design (the artist), another would engrave it (the engraver), another print it (the printer) and another publish it (the publisher). It was unusual for artists to engrave their own designs, due primarily to the social status attached to each job; engraving was not seen as an especially exalted profession, and was instead regarded {{as nothing more than}} mechanical reproduction. Artists like James Barry and John Hamilton Mortimer were the exceptions to the norm insofar as they tended to engrave their own material. A further division in the process was that text and images were handled by different artisans; text was printed by means of a movable letterpress, whereas images were engraved, two very different jobs.|$|E
30|$|Recently, cell {{tolerance}} toward environmental stresses {{has become}} <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> in <b>the</b> development of industrial microbial fermentation.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> is this bundle {{might not}} have a global section in general. This is where the [...] "problem" [...] of global {{anomalies}} comes in, for example. See Gribov ambiguity. This is a flaw in quantizing gauge theories many physicists overlooked.|$|R
