5|$|After I {{released}} my solo record I {{felt really}} disappointed, I {{believed in the}} record I made but if you don't have the back-up of your record company investing and marketing it. It's a really tough job and because I wrote <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> I really believed in this record, as did Nellee Hooper, I was jaded and disappointed.|$|E
5|$|Descartes {{rejects the}} teleological, or purposive, {{view of the}} {{material}} world that was dominant in the West {{from the time of}} Aristotle. The mind is not viewed by Descartes as part of the material world, and hence is not subject to the strictly mechanical laws of nature. Motion and rest, on the other hand, are properties of the interactions of matter according to eternally fixed mechanical laws. God only sets <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> in motion at the start, and later does not interfere except to maintain the dynamical regularities of the mechanical behavior of bodies. Hence there is no real teleology in the movements of bodies since <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> reduces to the law-governed collisions and their constant reconfigurations. The conatus is just the tendency of bodies to move when they collide with each other. God may set this activity in motion, but thereafter no new motion or rest can be created or destroyed.|$|E
5|$|I {{am afraid}} my {{men will be}} very angry when they see it. I cannot {{understand}} why the old man cannot do justice to those to whom he owed so much and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> is so absolutely inconsistent with what he had already cabled.|$|E
60|$|THE SQUIRE. [Deeply-to himself] <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing's</b> damn delicate.|$|R
6000|$|She {{drove in}} silence {{a third of}} a mile before she added, as if {{completing}} the sentence: [...] "Anyhow, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing's</b> quite absurd." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These are all bogus, too!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "There are no such {{streets as}} this in New York--no such names. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing's</b> a sell!" ...|$|R
5|$|When Black's car is searched, it {{is clear}} it was never rigged with anything—Dees had planned <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing,</b> knowing {{that he would be}} killed. As news reports spread {{concerning}} the bomber's identity and his death {{at the hands of the}} police, Black sees that Dees has achieved the fame he longed for.|$|E
5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing.</b> So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E
5|$|I {{called to}} him to turn hard opposite, so I could {{sandwich}} the Red fighters, but in his standard-rate bomber turn he got hit. I saw <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> and ordered him to dive and bail out immediately. To my intense relief I saw him leave the aircraft and his parachute blossom. I was happy to get this Airacobra, but I was mad at myself for not harkening to my intuition not to fly with Günther Capito.|$|E
6000|$|... "All I {{can tell}} you," [...] said Morris, with a harsh laugh, [...] "is that <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing's</b> impossible. My uncle is at Bournemouth, unable to move." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was a den of thieves. It was the hiding-place of Jack Riggs and {{his gang}} of road agents. I've been hunting this spot for three weeks. And now <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing's</b> up!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{who said}} it wasn't dead ahead?--tell me that. Shows how much you know about earthquakes. 'Course, I didn't mean just this continent, nor just this earth: I tell you, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing's</b> turned!" ...|$|R
5|$|Leslie goes to {{the police}} station. Initially angry, she {{eventually}} confesses about the marijuana. Dave releases Tom, who thanks Leslie for sticking up for him. The next day, Leslie and Dave go to the garden, but he finds no marijuana. Tom tells Leslie that Mark is an idiot, and she can do better. Dave guesses Leslie orchestrated <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> to spy on Ann and Mark. Later, Dave privately admits he is attracted to Leslie.|$|E
5|$|The {{report was}} written and re-written several times. Wetzler {{wrote the first}} part, Vrba the third, and the two wrote the second part together. They then worked on <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> together, re-writing it six times. Neumann's aide, Oscar Krasniansky, an {{engineer}} and stenographer who later took the name Oskar Isaiah Karmiel, translated it from Slovak into German {{with the help of}} Gisela Steiner. They produced a 40-page report in German, which was completed by Thursday, 27 April 1944. Vrba wrote that the report was also translated into Hungarian. The original Slovak version was not preserved.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E
6000|$|... "I follow you," [...] he agreed. [...] "Old {{lavender}} perfume, ottomans, high-backed chairs, chintzes {{that look}} as though they came out of the ark, and a few mouldy daguerreotypes. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing's</b> here, all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You did? Well, then, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing's</b> simple. All {{you have}} to do is to ask her how her eye is, and tell her she has the most {{beautiful}} eyes you ever saw, and coo a bit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] he demanded. [...] "That formula was {{the most}} {{wonderful}} thing that has ever been put together, and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing's</b> so simple. I've been afraid every second that some one else might stumble upon it." ...|$|R
5|$|The film {{references}} Resident Evil, {{with the}} crash site of the helicopter being located in the Arklay Forest near the Arklay Mountains, where the Resident Evil series began. Other similarities include Jill's moves from the first game. The recording of Terri's death is similar to Kenneth's death. A white goddess statue {{can be seen in}} the church, with artwork of goddesses having a large role in the puzzles of the Resident Evil series. Whilst walking on the Arklay Overpass, Jill speculates that there is no way out, and that Ashford may just be watching them on the cameras, as if <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> were some sort of sick game. The games use a fixed camera perspective, which in most of the earlier games resembles a mounted camera's perspective. Another similarity includes a scene where Jill finds a gun under a pew, mirroring the game when the player finds ammunition or weapons in certain areas.|$|E
5|$|During a {{brainstorm}} session, Michael, Jim, and Dwight {{decide to}} set up a sting operation to observe Danny's sales techniques. They set up Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) as the CEO of the fictional company Solartech in Dwight's office, fitted with security cameras, and watch from another room. Danny is then sent in to try to make a sale. All starts well until Meredith attempts to seduce him. Dwight and Jim send in Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) to save the sting. When Meredith strong-arms both of them, Michael rushes in to call <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> off. Danny becomes infuriated and walks off. Michael catches up to him and offers him a job, pointing out that with Sabre's better pricing, he could make more sales as a traveling salesman for them. He accepts the offer, and Michael introduces him as the new salesman to the office. The rest of the sales staff act disrespectful towards him, worrying that Danny will take their clients. Michael tells them how well sales numbers will go up with Danny {{as a part of the}} branch, and that he is not going to rescind Danny's job offer just because it makes the other salespeople uncomfortable. Before Dwight leaves for the day, he viciously insults Danny about his alleged mistreatment of Pam and client-stealing past, then immediately welcomes him to the company.|$|E
5|$|The Tamil text Sri Venkatachala Mahatyam relates Maya Sita to Vedavati, but {{her next}} birth is Padmavati, not Draupadi. After Ravana tries to molest Vedavati, she curses {{him that she}} would destroy his clan. She seeks the {{protection}} of Agni. Agni consoles her and gives her not only shelter but also {{the opportunity to take}} her vengeance. He disguises Vedavati as Sita, {{who is going to be}} kidnapped by Ravana and hides the real Sita in his refuge. At the time of Agni Pariksha, Vedavati enters the fire and Agni accompanies Sita and Vedavati out in public. Rama is perplexed seeing the two Sitas. The real Sita informs Rama that Vedavati was abducted in her place and suffered the incarceration in Lanka. She demands Rama to marry Vedavati, however Rama refuses citing his vow to have only one wife in this birth. He promises that in Kali yuga (the present and final age), when he appear on earth as Venkateshwara, Vedavati will be born as Padmavati, whom he will marry. Unlike Sanskrit texts, Agni plans <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> and Sita conspires with him to protect herself, but also safeguards the surrogate Sita's interests.|$|E
60|$|LORD W. Good God, man--more than that! I want to {{show the}} people that we stand side by side with them, as we did in <b>the</b> trenches. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing's</b> too jolly awful. I lie awake over it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Excellent!" [...] said Sam. [...] "Terrific! I knew I {{could rely on}} you. Say no more! <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing's</b> settled. You {{take her}} out rowing on the lake, and upset the boat. I plunge in ... I suppose you can swim?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He was obeyed, {{and for a}} {{few minutes}} glanced at the timber frame with a puzzled expression, then turning to Gillow, he said: [...] "You know I {{condemned}} that mode of scarting, and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing's</b> too light. What carpenters made it?" ...|$|R
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{appearing}} bored in class at a Catholic high school. Her assistant Felicia Culotta {{played the role}} of Spears's teacher. When the bell rings, Spears runs out into the hall and begins a choreographed dance in the corridor. After this, Spears is outside, now adorned in an pink athletic outfit, and seen in a car. Along with a couple of other students, she performs a number of gymnastic moves before heading back inside. She is then sitting on the bleachers in the gymnasium watching a basketball game, and she dances in the gymnasium. Her love interest is revealed sitting close to her, played by her real-life cousin Chad. After this short segment, Spears begins her final dance routine and the video ends shortly afterwards, and the bell rings and Spears leaves the gymnasium, revealing that <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> had actually just been Spears's daydream. During the very beginning, Spears is seen with her sleeves down. Some people who see the music video may not recognize this, but when the bell rings, the sleeves of exactly the same gray-and-white shirt she is wearing are rolled up, even when she gets into singing.|$|E
5|$|When Nicola feels {{down about}} Simon moving on, {{she decides to}} seduce Ivan. He rebuffs her {{advances}} but she tells Lesley, Rodney and Laurel that she slept with Ivan. When Ivan tries to get the truth, she convinces everyone else that he lying. Paul refuses to speak to Ivan and makes his father throw Nicola out of her home. She then tells Laurel that she lied about <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing.</b> Laurel then tells everyone inside the pub that Nicola has lied and Ivan refuses to accept everyone's apologies. Rodney thinks that Ivan and Paul should get back together and lets the whole pub know. Ivan is annoyed but then realises he is right. When Ivan asks Paul for another chance, he turns him down and Ivan leaves the village. When he returns, Simon is annoyed with him for leaving him {{to pay the rent}} on Mulberry Cottage. He forgives him when Ivan reveals that he is just back for his job. He is made haulage manager for Matthew and Sadie's new business after they poach him. However, the job soon ends and along with Simon they leave Emmerdale for a new life in Costa Rica.|$|E
25|$|The {{cover was}} {{supposed}} to be something that was for other people to savour rather than for me to actually spell everything out, which would make <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> rather disappointing on that level of your own personal adventure into the music.|$|E
60|$|Yet on <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>things</b> went well. No one molested the King's Visitor {{or those}} with him, the autumn weather held fine, the baby boy kept his health, and the country through which they passed was new to her and full of interest.|$|R
5000|$|Krailat Samreong - Rabam Krailat Samreong is {{the folk}} dancing {{demonstration}} {{taken from the}} Natasin college drama named [...] "Manorah". The Fine Arts Department demonstrated {{it to the people}} in 1955. This demonstration set showed the co-blessing from <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>things</b> living in Krilas Mountrain.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing's</b> so {{mad that}} if I wait till then I'll {{never want to}} do it. And you've got to come, so that I'll have some one to quarrel with.... I hate the smugness of London, {{especially}} the smugness of the anti-smug anti-bourgeois radicals, so that I have the finest mad mood! Come. We'll go." ...|$|R
25|$|The entire {{figure is}} then coated with clay made from termite hills until the mould is of a {{necessary}} thickness. Then <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> is dried and fired in an oven with cow-dung cakes. The wax model melts and flows out, {{while some of}} it vapourises.|$|E
25|$|Cal's offseason {{also was}} {{noted by the}} Kevin Hart controversy, where the small town {{offensive}} linemen would claim he had been recruited by the Golden Bears, although the athletic department claimed never {{to be involved with}} him. Hart would later admit he made <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> up.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these, come (which {{may or may}} not be an auxiliary) may be used to indicate speaker indignation, such as in Don't come acting like you don't know what happened and you started <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> ('Don't try to act as if you don't know what happened, because you started the whole thing').|$|E
6000|$|... 'On <b>the</b> <b>whole,</b> <b>things</b> seem to {{be going}} on favourably. The Banks Islanders are very shy now of the vessels sent to carry off men to Fiji or Queensland. They will find their way into the Solomon Islands soon. One, indeed, a cutter, has taken about twenty men from Ulava. They were all kept under hatches. We warn the people {{wherever}} we go.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, an' I {{think it}} was well worth that. I didn't really need it, an' if I could only have sold it I'd been all right, but now <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing's</b> got to go. I don't care so much for myself, but it'll come {{powerful}} hard on the wife, for she does set a store by the old place, if it is rough-lookin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|What is {{the good}} of keeping up the idyllic sham and pretending that ill-educated, {{misdirected}} people [...] "get along very well," [...] and that all this is harmlessly funny and nothing more?
