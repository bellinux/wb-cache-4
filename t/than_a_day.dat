5|$|England batted {{again and}} Tallon {{dismissed}} George Emmett from Lindwall with a diving one-handed catch. Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, {{who took it}} {{in his right hand}} with a dive, leaving England at 1/1. England then declared at 3/174; Tallon conceded nine byes and with more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> was lost to rain, Tallon was not required as Australia batted out the last session for a draw.|$|E

5|$|In England's second innings, Gooch {{played a}} lone hand. With the {{exception}} of Foster (34), promoted as nightwatchman {{at the end of}} day two, no-one else passed 15. When Gooch was last man out for 84 on the third day, England had compiled 202. The England bowlers managed to restrain the West Indian batsmen, Childs notably bowling 40 overs for just 79 runs, but, with more than two days left to play, there was little pressure on the West Indies, and they strolled to victory in 91 overs, losing just two wickets, with more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> to spare.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the efforts}} of the {{compulsory}} training scheme in the years before the war, very few of the men who served in the AN had had previous military experience. It had been hastily equipped and received only rudimentary training prior to its departure within days of its formation. During the stop over at Palm Island the men went ashore almost every day, and although the shingle beach, rocky ground and bush made the terrain unsuited to tactical manoeuvres, they were able to practice maintaining contact in dense jungle, a skill which later proved important during the fighting at Bita Paka. Yet, with the force remaining at Palm Island for only a week this training was limited and was unlikely to have adequately prepared the force if it were more seriously tested. Ultimately though this lack of training did not end up being costly as German resistance proved only limited, with the fighting over in less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> and resulting in fewer than a dozen Australian casualties.|$|E
5|$|Germany invaded both Norway and Denmark on 9 April 1940. Norway {{was very}} {{important}} to Germany for two reasons: firstly as a base for naval units to harass Allied shipping in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, and secondly to secure shipments of iron ore coming in from Sweden through the port of Narvik. During Operation Weserübung, Denmark fell in less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> becoming the briefest invasion in recorded military history. The Norwegians put up a stiffer resistance to the invading German forces. Nonetheless, by May the southern half of Norway was under German control. Following the German invasion of France and the Low Countries, the Allies were forced to evacuate Narvik, leaving the country to the Germans who would occupy it {{until the end of the}} war. After the invasion, Vidkun Quisling led the collaborationist government of Norway, based around the fascist Nasjonal Samling ("National Gathering") party.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, Klein's {{division}} {{was part of}} the newly created VIII. Corps, under command of Édouard Mortier; the role of the Corps was to patrol and secure the northern shore of the Danube river, limiting the Austro-Russian activity. Napoleon incorrectly assumed that the Russians and the Austrians would make a stand near St. Pölten, northwest of Vienna. Klein's entire regiment of dragoons patrolled the northern Danube shore, while the rest of his division, the last in the extended line of march, was more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> behind Maxime Gazan's lead division. Klein's division did not take part in the Battle of Dürenstein, although his dragoons were with Mortier and Gazan immediately prior to the engagement.|$|E

5|$|In 1833, his son Minh Mạng {{was faced}} with a {{rebellion}} led by Lê Văn Khôi, which started after the tomb of Khôi's father Lê Văn Duyệt was desecrated by imperial officials. The rebels took control of the citadel and the revolt continued until the imperial forces took control of the citadel in 1835. Following the capture of the citadel, Minh Mang ordered its razing and replacement with a smaller square stone-built structure, that was more vulnerable to attacks. On February 17, 1859, the citadel was captured during the French invasion after less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> of battle and significant amounts of military supplies were seized. Realising {{that they did not have}} the capacity to hold the fort against Vietnamese attempts to recapture it, the French razed it with explosives, before withdrawing their troops.|$|E
5|$|Most early {{accounts}} {{place the}} size of the Muslim forces between 24,000 and 40,000 and the number of Byzantine forces between 100,000 and 400,000. Modern estimates for the sizes of the respective armies vary: the vast majority of estimates for the Byzantine army are between 80,000 and 150,000, while other estimates are as low as 15,000 to 20,000. Estimates for the Rashidun army are between 25,000 and 40,000. Original accounts are mostly from Arab sources, generally agreeing that the Byzantine army and their allies outnumbered the Muslim Arabs by a sizeable margin. The only early Byzantine source is Theophanes, who wrote a century later. Accounts of the battle vary, some stating it lasted a day, others more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

Bryce Canyon has eight marked and maintained hiking trails that can be hiked in less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> (round trip time, trailhead): Mossy Cave (one hour, State Route 12 northwest of Tropic), Rim Trail (5–6 hours, anywhere on rim), Bristlecone Loop (one hour, Rainbow Point), and Queens Garden (1–2 hours, Sunrise Point) are easy to moderate hikes. Navajo Loop (1–2 hours, Sunset Point) and Tower Bridge (2–3 hours, north of Sunrise Point) are moderate hikes. Fairyland Loop (4–5 hours, Fairyland Point) and Peekaboo Loop (3–4 hours, Bryce Point) are strenuous hikes. Several of these trails intersect, allowing hikers to combine routes for more challenging hikes.|$|E

5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} lanthanum {{is made up}} of two isotopes, {{the stable}} 139La and the primordial long-lived radioisotope 138La. 139La {{is by far the most}} abundant, making up 99.910% of natural lanthanum: it is produced in the s-process (slow neutron capture, which occurs in low- to medium-mass stars) and the r-process (rapid neutron capture, which occurs in core-collapse supernovae). The very rare isotope 138La is one of the few primordial odd-odd nuclei, with a long half-life of 1.05×1011years: it is one of the proton-rich p-nuclei which cannot be produced in the s- or r-processes. 138La, along with the even rarer 180mTa, is produced in the ν-process, where neutrinos interact with stable nuclei. All other lanthanum isotopes are synthetic: with the exception of 137La with a half-life of about 60,000years, all of them have half-lives less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> and most have half-lives less than a minute. The isotopes 139La and 140La occur as fission products of uranium.|$|E

HD 142 is a yellow giant that has an apparent magnitude of 5.7, and has a planet (HD 142 b)1.36 times the mass of Jupiter which orbits every 328 days. HD 2039 is a yellow subgiant with an apparent magnitude of 9.0 around 330 light years away which has a planet (HD 2039 b) triple the mass of Jupiter. WASP-18 is a star of magnitude 9.29 which was discovered to have a hot Jupiter-like planet (WASP-18b) taking less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> to orbit the star. The planet is suspected to be causing WASP-18 to appear older than it really is. WASP-4 and WASP-5 are solar-type yellow stars around 1000 light years distant and of 13th magnitude, each with a single planet larger than Jupiter. WASP-29 is an orange dwarf of spectral type K4V and visual magnitude 11.3, which has a planetary companion of similar size and mass to Saturn. The planet completes an orbit every 3.9 days.|$|E
