5|$|The film {{score was}} written by English {{musician}} and composer David Julyan. Julyan had previously collaborated with director Christopher Nolan on Following, Memento and Insomnia. Following the film's narrative, the soundtrack had three sections: the Pledge, the <b>Turn,</b> <b>and</b> the Prestige.|$|E

60|$|Then he <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> {{left the}} garden, taking Dejah Thoris with him--his hand upon her shoulder. Thurid and Matai Shang went also, {{and as they}} reached the gateway the black <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> laughed again aloud in my face.|$|R
60|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> {{walked off}} in the {{opposite}} direction, and Mr. Walters, after a moment’s hesitation, <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> followed. They walked in this fashion for some distance; then the boatswain, quickening his pace, caught her roughly by the arm.|$|R
5|$|Early {{the next}} morning, September 3, the North Koreans heavily {{attacked}} Check's men {{in an effort}} to regain the ridge. Artillery, mortar, and tank fire barrages, and an air strike directed from the battalion command post, met this attack. Part of the battalion had to <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> fight toward its rear. After the attack had been repulsed hundreds of North Korean lay dead around the battalion position. A prisoner estimated that during September 2 and 3 the four North Korean battalions fighting Check's battalion had lost 1,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{invasion}} threat from France had passed and a lasting peace {{was made in}} 1558; government concerns shifted away from the south coast towards the Spanish threat to the south-west of England. By 1569, when Thomas Carew was serving as Hurst's captain, there were less than ten guns but the same size of garrison to that seven years before. His son, Sir Thomas Gorges, became captain in <b>turn,</b> <b>and</b> in 1593 he reported that the castle's gun platforms were in serious need of repair.|$|E
5|$|Then, on October 14, the National Weather Bureau {{issued a}} warning for the Carolinas, with the caveat {{that the worst}} of the {{hurricane}} was expected to stay offshore. Instead, the storm took a sharp northwest <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> headed toward land. By evening of the same day, the storm was forecast to make landfall near the Carolinas border. Further forecasts expected Hazel to lose its power and dissipate over the Allegheny Mountains.|$|E

5|$|With {{river traffic}} increasing, damage from barge {{collisions}} increased. By 1972, the Greenville Bridge was hit more times by barges {{than any other}} bridge on the Mississippi. The bridge was located close to a sharp bend in the Mississippi; towboats and barges had difficulty making the sharp <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> regaining their course in time to avoid a collision with the bridge. Over the years many {{have not been able}} to make the turn quickly and have hit it. The bridge had become a danger to river traffic.|$|E
5|$|A {{disturbance}} developed {{within the}} Intertropical Convergence Zone on June17 and remained distinct on its track west. An {{area of low pressure}} developed {{in association with}} the system over the northwestern Caribbean on June24 and further organized into a tropical depression by 18:00UTC the following day, supported by data from a reconnaissance aircraft. Steered west and eventually west-northwest by an expansive ridge across the Bahamas and Gulf of Mexico, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alex by 06:00UTC on June26 and attained an initial peak with winds of 65mph (100km/h) before moving ashore near Belize City, Belize several hours later. Alex maintained tropical storm intensity as it crossed the Yucatan Peninsula, and upon executing a northward <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> a second westward bend, began to steadily intensify. The cyclone intensified into the season's first hurricane at 00:00UTC on June30 and attained peak winds of 110mph (175km/h) as it made landfall near Soto la Marina, Mexico, at 02:00UTC on July1. Once inland, Alex turned west-southwest and rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of Mexico. It dissipated by 06:00UTC on July2.|$|E
5|$|After Oxbow's maiden win, he {{was flown}} to Hollywood Park in California {{to run in}} the Grade I CashCall Futurity at a mile and one-sixteenth (1,700m) on a {{synthetic}} surface. He was the longest shot in the field at 61–1, and drew the far outside post at number eleven. Ridden by Corey Nakatani, his fifth jockey in five races, Oxbow broke well coming out the gate. He ran close to the front throughout the race, despite losing ground by being four horses wide around the first <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> three wide around the final turn. Oxbow finished fourth, nine lengths back, but earned his first Road to the Kentucky Derby point, and a speed figure of 87.|$|E
5000|$|Step {{sequences}} may feature {{many different}} steps <b>and</b> <b>turns,</b> rotations in either direction, {{use of the}} upper body, and changes of rotational direction {{through the use of}} turns like rocker turns, counter <b>turns,</b> bracket <b>turns,</b> <b>and</b> twizzles. The steps may include mohawk <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> choctaw <b>turns.</b> There must be variety and complexity in the sequence to achieve a high level of difficulty.|$|R

25|$|Nursing {{homes and}} {{hospitals}} usually set programs {{in place to}} avoid the development of pressure ulcers in those who are bedridden, such as using a routine time frame for <b>turning</b> <b>and</b> repositioning to reduce pressure.

5|$|After departing {{the area}} {{he reached the}} west coast, but Braham had loitered for too long. He spotted two Fw 190s {{approaching}} fast from the east. Braham had shot down two of these machines in a Mosquito but he was uncertain of how experienced these pilots had been. There was no cloud cover and the Mosquito could not outrun the faster and more agile single-engine fighters for long. He decided to <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> fight while he still could. In a head-on attack the first Fw 190 pilot missed but the second struck the port wing and engine with cannon fire causing a large fire. The instrument panel and cockpit window was shot through missing both Walsh and Braham by inches. Braham dived to the sea levelling out below 100 feet. He tried to use the fire extinguisher to stop the fire. The German pilot shared Braham's philosophy of ensuring a kill by shooting at an enemy aircraft until it came down. The Mosquito was hit again and Braham crash-landed his aircraft onto a beach at 150 miles per hour.|$|E
5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the contact patch and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the contact patch towards {{the outside of the}} turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} contact patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the contact patch slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque that tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the <b>turn,</b> <b>and</b> therefore tends to decrease the turn radius.|$|E
5|$|At 8:24a.m. MDT, Reid's {{aircraft}} {{began its}} takeoff from Runway 30 to the northwest, in rain, strong gusty crosswinds and turbulence. According to witnesses, the plane lifted off and climbed slowly, with its nose high and its wings wobbling. It began a gradual right <b>turn,</b> <b>and</b> after reaching {{an altitude of}} a few hundred feet, the plane rolled out of its turn, then descended rapidly, crashing at a near-vertical angle into Kornegay Court, a street in a residential neighborhood. Dubroff, her father, and Reid were killed instantly by blunt force trauma sustained from impact forces. Reid, who was legally the pilot in command for all of Dubroff's flights, was allegedly manipulating the controls during this particular flight segment.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the day on July 20, Dean {{ordered the}} {{headquarters}} of the 34th Infantry to withdraw. Dean remained behind and assisted the US troops in evacuating the city until the last convoy was ready to leave Taejon. As the last convoy of troops moved out of the city and fought through a North Korean roadblock, Dean, with a small force of soldiers, followed them. At the edge of the city, the final elements of the 34th Infantry, leaving the city in 50 vehicles, were ambushed and many of their vehicles were destroyed by machine guns and mortars, forcing the Americans to retreat on foot. In the ensuing fight, Dean's jeep made a wrong <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> was separated from the rest of the American forces.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{play out}} using a turn-based system where each unit {{on both sides}} is given their chance to move and act. Characters move and attack within the same <b>turn,</b> <b>and</b> {{in a few cases}} units can take two moves in a turn. A key part of combat is the Weapons Triangle, a new {{addition}} which governs the opposing strengths and weaknesses of weapon types based on a rock–paper–scissors system - lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. A secondary system governs the magic system, where Fire, Lightning, and Wind spells have varying strengths and weaknesses against each other. Each unit has a character class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, how much effect they have on other units, which latent skills they possess, and whether they use passive or aggressive skills when in combat. Different weapon types also affect character movement and battle performance: for instance, a powerful sword deals damage while slowing a character's movement.|$|E
5|$|By October 1797, {{the plan}} to attack Ireland had been {{abandoned}} and the British North Sea Fleet was again at full strength. During a brief period replenishing supplies at Yarmouth, news reached Duncan on 10 October that the Dutch had sailed on a raiding cruise and {{he returned to the}} Dutch coast, intercepting de Winter's fleet on its way back to the Texel. The Dutch formed a line of battle in shallow coastal waters to meet Duncan's attack, which was conducted in a confused mass, the British fleet separating into two groups that struck the vanguard and rear of the Dutch fleet, overwhelming each in <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> capturing eleven ships, including de Winter's flagship Vrijheid. On the return journey, three of the captured ships were lost, and none of the surviving Dutch prizes was ever suitable for active service again. Both sides suffered heavy casualties during the battle as each fleet had been trained to aim at the hulls of their opponents, maximising the damage to personnel.|$|E

5|$|Continuing eastward, {{the drive}} descends down the {{mountain}} toward Copper Harbor. The roadway twists and turns as it alternately climbs and descends several smaller hills along the ridgeline. Along the drive, several viewpoints provide the opportunity to pull off and take in the surroundings. A few of them lie directly adjacent to {{the face of the}} bluff where the mountain quickly rises from the surrounding land. Near the eastern end, there are two sharp hairpin turns, the first of which has a scenic overlook and parking area. This spot overlooks Copper Harbor and the nearby Copper Country Trail National Scenic Byway portion of US Highway 41 (US41) just to the east. From here, the road makes its steep descent down from the ridge, through the second <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> ends at M-26 on the western edge of town.|$|E
5|$|Continuing toward Fort Bridger {{from the}} Green River, the main trail crosses Hams Fork near Granger and {{followed}} Blacks Fork to Fort Bridger. Established in 1842 by legendary frontiersman Jim Bridger {{and his partner}} Louis Vasquez, Fort Bridger was a vital refueling post and a welcome rest after the particularly difficult journey from South Pass. Even after the Sublette cutoff was established, settlers destined for Oregon who were low on livestock and supplies would bypass the cutoffs and make the longer trip to Fort Bridger to restock. Fort Bridger is {{the point at which}} the Mormon Trail splits from the Oregon Trail and California Trail for good. The Mormon Trail continues southwest, fording the Bear River and crossing into Utah south of the current town of Evanston. The other trails <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> proceed northwest, crossing the Bear River Divide and into the Bear River valley on the western side of the state. The trail meets the Sublette cutoff near Cokeville and the rejoined trails follow the Bear River upstream and into Idaho, heading for Fort Hall.|$|E
5|$|Da Matta, Andretti, and Franchitti contended {{for third}} {{position}} until the field closed {{up because of}} the presence of slower cars. The third caution was shown fourteen laps later when Adrián Fernández lost engine power driving into the second <b>turn,</b> <b>and</b> he went to the bottom of the track on the backstretch to retire. Oil was laid on the track heading into turn two, and marshals were required to clean it. It was announced on lap 90 that Kniefel had reduced the number of laps to be run from 168 to 140 because of the danger from fading sunlight. All of the leaders (including Bräck) chose to make pit stops for fuel and tyres under caution on lap 100. Castroneves passed da Matta and Andretti around the inside in the pit lane and Newman/Haas Racing believed he had committed an infraction. The team informed CART of Castroneves' passing, which was observed by their co-owner Paul Newman.|$|E
