5|$|A feature {{coming into}} wide use in modern shortwave {{receivers}} is DSP technology, short for digital signal processing. DSP {{is the use}} of digital means to process signals, and a primary benefit in shortwave receivers is the ability to tailor the bandwidth of <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> <b>to</b> current reception conditions and to the type of signal being listened to. A typical analog-only receiver may have a limited number of fixed bandwidths, or only one, but a DSP receiver may have 40 or more individually selectable filters.|$|E
5|$|MAR used {{separate}} transmitter and receivers, {{a necessity}} {{at the time}} due {{to the size of}} the individual transmit and receive units and the switching systems that would be required. Each transmitter antenna was fed by its own power amplifier using travelling wave tubes with switching diodes and striplines performing the delays. The broadcast signal had three parts in sequence and the receivers had three channels, one tuned to each part of the pulse chain. This allowed <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> <b>to</b> send each part of the signal to different processing equipment, allowing search, track, and discrimination in a single pulse.|$|E
5|$|Signals {{are given}} in {{contexts}} such as mate selection by females, which subjects the advertising males' signals to selective pressure. Signals thus evolve because they modify the behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> <b>to</b> benefit the signaller. Signals may be honest, conveying information which usefully increases the fitness of the receiver, or dishonest. An individual can cheat by giving a dishonest signal, which might briefly benefit that signaller, {{at the risk of}} undermining the signalling system for the whole population.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an efficient authentication method for JPEG images based on Genetic Algorithms (GA). The current authentication methods for JPEG images require <b>the</b> <b>receivers</b> <b>to</b> know <b>the</b> quantization table beforehand {{in order to}} authenticate the images. Moreover, the quantization tables used in the JPEG compression are different for differ-ent quality factors, thus increasing the burden on <b>the</b> <b>receivers</b> <b>to</b> maintain several quantization tables. We propose a novel GA-based method which possesses three advantages. First, the computation at <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> end is simplified. Second, {{it is no more}} required for <b>the</b> <b>receivers</b> <b>to</b> maintain quantization tables. Third, the method is resistant against Vector Quantiza-tion (VQ) and Copy-Paste (CP) attacks by generating the authentication information which is unique with respect to each block and each image. Furthermore, we develop a two- level detection strategy to reduce the false acceptance ratio of in-valid blocks. Experimental results show that the proposed GA-based method can successfully authenticate JPEG images under variant attacks...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a new layered {{multicast}} protocol, called Fast-response Receiver-driven Layered Multicast (FRLM), is proposed. The {{differences between}} our FRLM {{and the original}} RLM are only at <b>the</b> <b>receivers.</b> Our design allows <b>the</b> <b>receivers</b> <b>to</b> track <b>the</b> available network bandwidth faster; this enables <b>the</b> <b>receivers</b> <b>to</b> converge to their optimal number of subscribed layers quicker, and {{to respond to the}} network congestion prompter. An early trigger mechanism for shortening IGMP leave latency is also designed. We show that FRLM can avoid several potential problems with the original RLM, which have been overlooked previously. Last but not the least, FRLM is a practical scheme that can be readily implemented in today's best-effort Internet. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

25|$|Timestamp: (32 bits) Used {{to enable}} <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> <b>to</b> play back the {{received}} samples at appropriate intervals. When several media streams are present, the timestamps are independent in each stream, {{and may not}} be relied upon for media synchronization. The granularity of the timing is application specific.

The clock granularity is one of the details that is specified in the RTP profile for an application.|$|E
25|$|Matrix {{inversion}} {{also plays}} {{a significant role in the}} MIMO (Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output) technology in wireless communications. The MIMO system consists of N transmit and M receive antennas. Unique signals, occupying the same frequency band, are sent via N transmit antennas and are received via M receive antennas. The signal arriving at each receive antenna will be a linear combination of the N transmitted signals forming a NxM transmission matrix H. It is crucial for the matrix H to be invertible for <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> <b>to</b> be able to figure out the transmitted information.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} {{technique for}} buddy breathing {{is for the}} divers to alternately breathe from the demand valve, usually each taking two breaths before exchanging the DV, but {{it is common for}} <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> <b>to</b> be out of breath {{at the start of the}} procedure, and they may need a few more breaths to stabilize. Once a rhythm has been established, it is usual to terminate the dive and start the ascent, so buddy breathing training will usually include assisted ascents. Assisted ascents using a secondary demand valve are simpler than buddy breathing ascents, and this skill is quicker to learn.|$|E
25|$|Sequence number: (16 bits) The {{sequence}} number is incremented by {{one for each}} RTP data packet sent and {{is to be used}} by <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> <b>to</b> detect packet loss and to restore packet sequence.

For example, video applications may play the last known frame in place of the missing frame. According to , the initial value of the {{sequence number}} should be random to make known-plaintext attacks on encryption more difficult. RTP provides no guarantee of delivery, but the presence of sequence numbers makes it possible to detect missing packets.|$|E
25|$|The Sirius {{signal is}} {{separated}} into three carriers, one each {{for the two}} satellites, and the third for the terrestrial repeater network where available. Sirius receivers decode all three 4MHz carrier signals at once to achieve signal diversity. This {{is in contrast to}} XM which uses six carriers and decodes three 2MHz carriers to economize on receiver power consumption and complexity at the cost of channel-changing speed. There is an intentional four-second delay between the two satellite carrier signals. This enables <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> <b>to</b> maintain a large buffer of the audio stream, which, along with forward error correction, helps keep the audio playing in the event that the signal is temporarily lost, such as when driving under an overpass or otherwise losing line-of-sight of any of the satellites or ground repeater stations.|$|E

40|$|Handling {{interference}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} challenges in the design of wireless networks. One of the key approaches to interference management is node cooperation, which can be classified into two main types: relaying and feedback. In this work we consider simultaneous application of both cooperation types in the presence of interference. We obtain exact characterization of the capacity regions for Rayleigh fading and phase fading interference channels with a relay and with feedback links, in the strong and very strong interference regimes. Four feedback configurations are considered: (1) feedback from both <b>receivers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relay, (2) feedback from each <b>receiver</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relay and to one of the transmitters (either corresponding or opposite), (3) feedback from one of <b>the</b> <b>receivers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relay, (4) feedback from one of <b>the</b> <b>receivers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relay and to one of the transmitters. Our results show that there is a strong motivation for incorporating relaying and feedback into wireless networks. Comment: Accepted to the IEEE Transactions on Information Theor...|$|R
