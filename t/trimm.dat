40|$|The study {{evaluates the}} virtues of {{asymmetric}} trimmed means as efficient estimators of core inflation for Colombia, an economy with high and variable inflation rates. Results suggest that the proposed indicators are more efficient than alternative indexes and are particularly suited for environments where price change distributions are non-normal. Computations indicate that an optimally trimmed estimator for the 27 -component Colombian CPI during the 1972 : 06 to 1997 : 12 period requires that 12 percent be trimmed from the upper tail and 24 percent from the lower tail. This indicator exhibits substantially higher efficiency than the weighted average of price changes (i-e.,CPI inflation), the CPI excluding food and energy, the median and symmetric <b>trimmmed</b> means. These findings are robust {{to changes in the}} 36 -month centered moving average benchmarck of annual inflation. the medain and symmmetric trimmed means. These findings are robust changes in the 36 -month centerd moving average benchmark of annual inflation. The optimal estimator is not found to be robust to changes in data sample. This is likely due to changes in parameters of the underying data distribution due to structural changes in the Colombian economy, particularly in the post- 1990 period. Optimal levels of asymmetrical trimming are also found to be highly sensitive to the degree of disaggregation of the CPI data. This is expected since greater disaggregation reveals higher kurtosis and skewness of the underying data. The CPI excluding food and energy and the median do not seem to provide persistent efficiency gaings in estimation of inflation with respect to the weighted mean. Food and energy prices are critical sectors of middle income economies such as Colombia and contain valuable information about medium and long-term trends in inflation. Finally, the median excludes many prices-especially those in the upper tail- that seem to contain valuable information about long-term trends in inflation. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Nucleotides are trimmed {{from the}} ends of {{variable}} (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) genes during immunoglobulin (IG) and T cell receptor (TR) rearrangements in B cells and T cells of the immune system. This trimming is followed by addition of nucleotides at random, forming the N regions (N for nucleotides) of the V-J and V-D-J junctions. These processes are crucial for creating diversity in the immune response since the number of trimmed nucleotides {{and the number of}} added nucleotides vary in each B or T cell. IMGT ® sequence analysis tools, IMGT/V-QUEST and IMGT/JunctionAnalysis, are able to provide detailed and accurate analysis of the final observed junction nucleotide sequences (tool "output"). However, as trimmed nucleotides can potentially be replaced by identical N region nucleotides during the process, the observed "output" represents a biased estimate of the "true trimming process. " Results A probabilistic approach based on an analysis of the standardized tool "output" is proposed to infer the probability distribution of the "true <b>trimmming</b> process" and to provide plausible biological hypotheses explaining this process. We collated a benchmark dataset of TR alpha (TRA) and TR gamma (TRG) V-J rearranged sequences and junctions analysed with IMGT/V-QUEST and IMGT/JunctionAnalysis, the nucleotide sequence analysis tools from IMGT ®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system ®, [URL]. The standardized description of the tool output is based on the IMGT-ONTOLOGY axioms and concepts. We propose a simple first-order model that attempts to transform the observed "output" probability distribution into an estimate closer to the "true trimming process" probability distribution. We use this estimate to test the hypothesis that Poisson processes are involved in trimming. This hypothesis was not rejected at standard confidence levels for three of the four trimming processes: TRAV, TRAJ and TRGV. Conclusion By using trimming of rearranged TR genes as a benchmark, we show that a probabilistic approach, applied to IMGT ® standardized tool "outputs" opens the way to plausible hypotheses on the events involved in the "true trimming process" and eventually to an exact quantification of trimming itself. With increasing high-throughput of standardized immunogenetics data, similar probabilistic approaches will improve understanding of processes so far only characterized by the "output" of standardized tools. </p...|$|R
6000|$|I {{found the}} story of the Countess Cathleen in what professed to be a {{collection}} of Irish folk-lore in an Irish newspaper some years ago. I wrote to the compiler, asking about its source, but got no answer, but have since heard that it was translated from Les Matin`ees de Timoth`e <b>Trimm</b> a good many years ago, and has been drifting about the Irish press ever since. L`eo Lesp`es gives it as an Irish story, and though the editor of Folklore has kindly advertised for information, the only Christian variant I know of is a Donegal tale, given by Mr. Larminie in his West Irish Folk Tales and Romances, of a woman who goes to hell for ten years to save her husband, and stays there another ten, having been granted permission to carry away as many souls as could cling to her skirt. L`eo Lesp`es may have added a few details, but I have no doubt of the essential antiquity of what seems to me the most impressive form of one of the supreme parables of the world.
