Keeping up with technological, economic, social, cultural, and political advancements in the first world is becoming an extremely laborious and costly, and ultimately impossible, task. This impossibility makes the task culturally alienating, since a nation will have to espouse the “language carrier”, namely English, and its cultural “load”. This paper is an attempt to draw the attention of all the Arab scientists as well as administrators and thinkers to the important, in fact strategic, nature of Machine Translation. The paper surveys the state of the technology as well as its western products and contrasts them to the state of Arabic Machine Translation.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is <b>to</b> put <b>forward</b> <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> for <b>a</b> {{methodology}} to analyze the sustainability of the expansion of electricity generation. To do so, an approach is needed that takes into account, in an integrated perspective, the technical, socioeconomic, environmental and technological factors of the various alternatives for sector expansion. In this regard, multicriteria analysis (MCA) is proposed as an evaluation tool. It will be applied to a situation that involves the selection of the following expansion alternatives: small hydropowers, wind energy, generation from sugarcane bagasse, biodiesel, urban solid wastes, natural gas and nuclear energy. The methodology involved the development of indicators encompassing technological, environmental social and economic dimensions, for each of the aforementioned expansion alternatives, and the results were very interesting, from a multicriteria point of view, in their capacity to internalize socioenvironmental, technological and economic aspects in the decision making process for electricity generation expansion. It may well prove to be a useful tool for supporting this decision, although efforts are required to standardize the methodology with regard to its evaluation procedures.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{to restrict the}} spermatocyte population in mice and other rodents using hydroxyurea (HU) and triaziquone (T). HU affects cells in S-phase, whereas T is an agent especially active on spermatogonia and not on spermatocytes. An application of three i. p. HU injections with 12 h intervals, followed about nine days later by one i. p. T injection creates two large gaps in the spermatogenic line. The two gaps enclose a small, well-defined group of primary spermatocytes in meiotic interphase. - The development of the restricted spermatocyte population is followed day by day. The analysis of meiosis in male mice has revealed the correct sequence of meiotic, and especially prophase I stages. On account of clearly visible differences in chromosome morphology the diplotene stage could be divided into three periods. It is suggested to use the following nomenclature: pre-diffuse diplotene, diffuse diplotene and post-difuse diplotene.

40|$|English law has {{demonstrated}} {{itself to be}} particularly hostile {{to the idea of}} holding parents tortiously liable for the acts of their children. It deals with allegations of parental negligence with a degree of leniency that, arguably, defies all rational justification. In advocating reform, the primary objective of this thesis is <b>to</b> put <b>forward</b> <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> for <b>a</b> new regime of liability that obliges parents to take much greater legal responsibility for their children's conduct. The proposition set out is that English law has a lot to learn from the continental approach to parental liability. In seeking guidelines for change, the French system is singled out as a particularly good model for comparison. Over the years it has experimented with different forms of parental liability, and so its law in this respect is well developed, not to mention excellently documented. The French system offers two main options for reform: a regime of strict liability based on a rebuttable presumption of fault or a regime of vicarious liability. It is contended that, for present purposes, the former offers the more viable solution for a legal system that is notoriously resistant to the concept of no-fault liability. In adapting this French regime to suit English needs, the focus of this thesis is on the substantive legal issues involved. The normative feasibility of the proposed regime is established by demonstrating its consistency with the principles of English negligence law. This, in turn, is done by demonstrating the existence, in a typical parental liability action, of the elements of duty of care, breach of duty and both factual and legal causation...|$|R

The centers presented their proposed center programs and budgets for 1976 at ICW under a new procedure, half in full, the others in abbreviated form.

The Chairman found a consensus on the need for an overall review of the System and promised <b>to</b> bring <b>forward</b> <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> for such <b>a</b> review at ICW 1976. Further discussion of the report focused on the allocation of scarce financial resources, unexpected expenditures by centers, and the annual review of center programs and budgets.

The chairman of the ICARDA subcommittee reported on progress in establishing the center and presented its 1976 program and budget.

A sustainable mobility plan is an integrated plan considering all modes of transport planned towards a sustainable urban development. The measures implemented are a mixture of physical changes and information with the aim to reach a better traffic environment with reduced traffic volumes and emissions, increased accessibility and safety: and an increased quality of life for all citizens. The physical changes can be compared to traditional traffic planning while the information part goes under the name Mobility Management and includes among other things change of travel habits. In some European countries implementation of transport plans have already been done. This is the case in the United Kingdom where Local Transport Plans, LTP are done for all regions: France which has their Urban Mobility Master Plans, PDU, Holland and Italy. In Spain there is no tradition of creating integrated mobility plans though at present they are developing a guide for cities larger than 100. 000 inhabitants according to the EU proposal. Sweden is known as a precursor country of how to reach a sustainable environment but in this case there is no all embracing plan for transports.

40|$|The current Danish {{environmental}} approval system (godkendelsessystemet) {{is based upon}} the Environmental Protection Law from 1992. The principle of cleaner technology is the leading elemtent in this legislation. This implies that a firms pollution shall be limited as much as possible, where the pollution that derives from the production phase, together with the manufacturing, consumption and waste phases are accounted for. The local councils have however experienced difficulty in advancing the implementation of cleaner technology in firms. This reports objective is thereby <b>to</b> put <b>forward</b> <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> on how the {{environmental approval}} system can be revised in order that the principle of cleaner tecnology can be succesfully integrated into local environmental administration. Based upon the assertion {{that there is a need}} to integrate environmental protection into a firms production strategy, which can be achieved through a modification in the systems present methodology, are a number of instruments discussed and developed with the intention of integrating them into <b>a</b> draft <b>proposal</b> for how the environmental approval system should be reformed.

The conclusions from this analysis lead to a subsequent revision of the draft proposal. The report concludes that the revised application procedure is a suitable method for identifying both pollution and potential cleaner technology projects, which can in itself provide an incentive for a firm to implement cleaner technology. This will also give the local councils case officer an improved foundation from which he/she can enter into consultations with the respective firm. Finally, since the environmental standards in the revised system are based upon relative amounts, the dimension of continual improvement that constitutes the most important elements of the principle of cleaner technology, is ensured...|$|R
