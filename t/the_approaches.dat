40|$|Manufacturing {{functions}} need to {{be capable}} of constantly developing new manufacturing lines, cells, and pieces of equipment in order to maintain their operational competitiveness. This paper explores a unique approach to analyzing and designing manufacturing processes referred to as the Value Adding Process Point (VAPP) approach. This approach particularly focuses on the points where value is added to materials in manufacturing processes. <b>The</b> <b>approach</b> is mostly used at Japanese companies and it has contributed to developing unique manufacturing lines, cells, and pieces of equipment that tend to be simple, slim, and compact, and require low investment cost. <b>The</b> <b>approach</b> has also contributed to achieving major improvements in different performance measures in manufacturing. However, <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> is rarely known internationally. Moreover, the amount of practical information on how to apply <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> at companies has been limited in the scarce literature on <b>the</b> <b>approach.</b> <b>The</b> {{purpose of this paper is}} to introduce <b>the</b> VAPP <b>approach</b> to a broader audience and also to provide practical information on how to apply <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> by describing a case study in which <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> was applied at a Swedish manufacturing company.

5|$|During the French Revolutionary Wars the Royal Navy had exerted {{dominance}} at sea {{over its}} continental rivals, most immediately the French Navy with its principal fleet based at Brest on the Breton {{coast of the}} Bay of Biscay. To contain this fleet the British practiced a close blockade strategy; maintaining a fleet off Brest whenever weather conditions permitted to prevent the French fleet from breaking out into the Atlantic Ocean. This blockade force also limited French trade and maritime communications, attacking merchant ships and individual warships seeking to resupply or reinforce the main French fleet. This made French maritime journeys extremely hazardous even in inshore waters: in June 1795 the main French fleet had suffered a defeat {{at the hands of}} the blockade force at the Battle of Groix in <b>the</b> <b>approaches</b> to the port of Lorient, while at the Action of 13 January 1797 the independently sailing 74-gun ship of the line Droits de l'Homme was driven ashore and destroyed in <b>the</b> <b>approaches</b> to Brest by two frigates of the blockade squadron.|$|E
