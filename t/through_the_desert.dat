Heraclius effected his retreat <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> into Tripolitania, holding the position for two years until recalled; Marcellinus retired to Sicily, where he was reached by Basiliscus; the general was, however, assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer, by one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals expressed his surprise and satisfaction, that the Romans themselves would remove from the world his most formidable antagonists.|$|E

5|$|Harrison Scott, {{a retired}} engineer, was {{traveling}} north on I-5 {{with his son}} in 1991, when his son speculated about the difficulty of driving over the first road through the rugged terrain. Having some extra time, and recalling a drive on the old road in 1955, they left the freeway and traveled along most of the abandoned section. Near SR138, Scott asked a county road crew which was resurfacing the road if it was still maintained by the county, and the crew replied that they didn't know who maintained it <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert.</b> It {{turned out that the}} county officially owned it but did not maintain it; Scott has since convinced the county and forest to exchange ownership with the Santa Anita Canyon Road, then a county road.|$|E
5|$|State Route 78 (SR78) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California that runs from Oceanside east to Blythe, {{traversing}} nearly the entire width of the state. Its western terminus is at Interstate 5 (I-5) in San Diego County and its eastern terminus is at I-10 in Riverside County. The route is a freeway through the heavily populated cities of northern San Diego County and a two-lane highway running through the Cuyamaca Mountains to Julian.

5|$|The 162nd Division, {{concentrated}} {{south of}} Tasa, {{had been standing}} by to cross the canal since dawn on October 16. The division advanced towards the canal, but movement was hampered by the massive traffic jams on the roads leading to the canal. When Adan realized that Akavish was closed, he ordered a tank battalion to make a turning maneuver <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> to reach Deversoir. When it arrived, Sharon contacted Adan, explaining Reshef's difficult situation, and requested that the battalion be placed under his command.

5|$|The troops {{selected}} for the operation were among the best soldiers in Kitchener's army: the 3rd Egyptian, 9th Sudanese, 10th Sudanese, and 11th Sudanese Battalions, composing Lieutenant Hector Archibald MacDonald's brigade. Additionally, Hunter's column included an artillery battery, containing six Krupp twelve-pounders, two Maxim guns, {{and a pair of}} older British machine guns, a Gardner and Nordenfelt. Finally, a single troop of cavalry was attached to the column along with a substantial supply of camels for transport and supply. The column had rations for eighteen days, and telegraph cable was supplied in the hope that constant communication could be ensured as the column made the 146 mile journey <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert.</b> Overall, the force numbered around 3600 soldiers.|$|E
5|$|By early July, {{the sick}} at Kermanshah had {{recovered}} and rejoined the expedition. Camels and water bags were purchased, and the parties left Isfahan separately on 3 July 1915 {{for the journey}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert,</b> hoping to rendezvous at Tebbes, halfway to the Afghan border. Von Hentig's group travelled with twelve pack horses, twenty-four mules, and a camel caravan. Throughout the march, {{efforts were made to}} throw off the British and Russian patrols. False dispatches spread disinformation on the group's numbers, destination, and intention. To avoid the extreme daytime heat, they travelled by night. Food was found or bought by Persian messengers sent ahead of the party. These scouts also helped identify hostile villages and helped find water. The group crossed the Persian desert in forty nights. Dysentery and delirium plagued the party. Some Persian guides attempted to defect, and camel drivers had to be constantly vigilant for robbers. On 23 July, the group reached Tebbes– the first Europeans after Sven Hedin. They were soon followed by Niedermayer's party, which now included explorer Wilhelm Paschen and six Austrian and Hungarian soldiers who had escaped from Russian prisoner of war camps in Turkestan. The arrival was marked by a grand welcome by the town's mayor. However, the welcome meant the party had been spotted.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Gaga, {{dressed in black}} clothing, sunglasses, bloody feet, and {{seemingly}} bionic features, walking through a field in Nebraska; having returned on foot after years of absence. Gaga goes to buy ice cream from an ice cream truck, but she suddenly drops it as a toothless man with a doll in his hand grins at her. She begins to have flashbacks to an earlier time spent in Nebraska as scenes of Gaga having a wedding, being tortured by a man inside a barn, and being inside a water tank appear in quick succession. The song starts playing as the camera zooms slowly towards Gaga, who is standing bent forward as she begins singing. The video continually switches to scenes where Gaga, with little make up, a simple gray-colored hair style, and a white dress, plays a piano {{in the middle of}} a cornfield, while her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, sits on top of the piano, smoking and drinking a beer. As Calderone pulls up his sleeves, present day Gaga is still walking <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert.</b>|$|E
5|$|The poem is a twelve book {{work with}} {{irregular}} stanzas and lines {{that are not}} rhymed. The poem deals with Harun al-Rashid {{and a group of}} sorcerers at Domdaniel that live under the sea. It was foretold that Thalaba, a Muslim, would be God's champion and conquer the sorcerers. To pre-empt the prophecy, the sorcerers kill the Hodeirah family. Unknown to them, Thalaba was able to escape from harm with his mother Zeinab. They flee <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> and arrive at Irem, a ruined city. After Zeinab dies, Thalaba is raised by a leader of Irem named Moath. The sorcerers find out that Thalaba is still alive, and Abdaldar, one of their members, goes to find out Thalaba's location. When Abdaldar arrives, he is stopped a simoom, a sand storm, and his magic ring is lost. Thalaba finds the ring, which grants him great power.|$|E

Kesha walks <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> while split scenes of her are shown where she is riding an elephant and wearing a tiger mask while crawling around in the sand. They are later seen on a boat singing and pretending to row while digitally animated water is added. It then cuts to a scene of all animation in which Kesha is portrayed as a mermaid. The mermaid and the man share a kiss; the video then jumps to a scene on a rocky hillside with Kesha walking around the sand with the man standing above on a rock. The video then cuts to another scene where Kesha is covered in glow in the dark body paint while dancing around in a cave with a python around her neck.

5|$|Mulder {{telephones}} Scully {{and tries}} to explain that he's the real Mulder. Scully does not believe him and asks Fletcher—in Mulder's body—to pick up {{and listen to the}} conversation. Fletcher decides they should immediately report this incident, which further confuses Scully. She goes to Mulder’s apartment (where Fletcher is having a tryst with Kersh's assistant) and tells Fletcher that they traced the telephone call to a pay phone near Area 51 and she suspects it is Mulder's informant. Fletcher is indifferent to this news and Scully yells at him, sensing that his behavior is very strange and his lack of concern for the X-Files is completely out of character. Scully decides to investigate, and drives <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> towards Area 51. She stops at a burned out gas station and finds a penny and a dime merged. Later, when Scully arrives at Fletcher's house, Mulder tries desperately to convince Scully that he is really Mulder. Scully remains skeptical and thinks that any information Mulder describes could be obtained in other ways. Mulder tells Scully that he will bring proof of the defect of the UFO and the resultant problems that night, but Fletcher, having eavesdropped on the conversation, calls his old office posing as Mulder to inform them of the source of the leak—Mulder posing as Fletcher. Military police arrive at the appointed hour, and Mulder is dragged away, kicking and screaming, desperately trying to convince Scully. Mulder asks if he would turn in an informant to the authorities in this manner as he is carried away, and Scully begins to realize that Mulder may be telling the truth.|$|E

In February 2009, members of the SBS took part in Operation Diesel, which resulted in the seizure of £50 million of heroin and the killing of at least 20 Taliban insurgents. On 9 September 2009, an SBS team supported by the SFSG rescued Times journalist Stephen Farrell after he and his Afghan interpreter were captured by the Taliban whilst reporting on the Kunduz airstrike and were held at a Taliban safe house in Char Dara District, Kunduz Province. The British special forces were forced to act when signal intercepts of Taliban leader showed them discussing moving the hostages into Pakistan. They were inserted by 160th SOAR helicopters at pre-dawn directly onto the target building, whilst the SFSG set up a cordon, the Afghan interpreter was accidentally shot and killed as was two civilians by an explosive breaching charge on the compound, whilst a soldier from the SFSG was killed, Farrell was rescued. On 1 July 2010 whilst carrying out an operation against insurgents in Haji Wakil, Helmand Province, Corporal Seth Stephens of the SBS was killed during a heavy firefight whilst clearing a compound, {{as a result of his}} actions during that operation, he was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross.

5|$|Sailing via Colombo {{where the}} troops were given a brief shore leave, the Stratheden entered the Suez Canal in mid-December 1940. Upon arrival in the Middle East, the {{battalion}} briefly occupied a camp at El Kantara, before moving to Dimra, in Palestine. At Dimra, the battalion joined {{the rest of the}} 26th Brigade for the first time, and undertook further training until March 1941. At this time, it moved to Cyrenica, {{along with the rest of}} the 9th Division, to undertake further training in the desert and to relieve the 6th Division which was deploying to Greece. Shortly after this, the Germans landed forces in Africa to reinforce the Italians and as the Axis went on the offensive, the British and Commonwealth forces in Libya were forced to retreat from Benghazi to the strategically important port town of Tobruk. In early April, the 2/48th fell back as part of the general retreat, setting up a blocking position around Tmimi during the withdrawal to prevent a German force cutting the division's route along the coast road. After eight days of constant movement <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert,</b> the battalion reached the port. They subsequently took part in the defence of Tobruk, where the battalion saw its first action of the North African Campaign for which it would receive one of its many battle honours.|$|E
