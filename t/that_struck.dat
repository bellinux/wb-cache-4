5|$|Until 2011, Kate's was {{considered}} the second-latest hurricane landfall in the United States, behind only a cyclone in 1925 <b>that</b> <b>struck</b> on December1; however, a systematic reanalysis indicated that the 1925 system was only a tropical storm. In turn, Kate took the record. With Kate's landfall, the 1985 season had six hurricanes <b>that</b> <b>struck</b> the United States, only one short of the record seven in 1886.|$|E

2500|$|The Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael {{asked how}} the captives had sinned <b>that</b> God <b>struck</b> their firstborn, as [...] reports.

Alternatively, the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael told <b>that</b> God <b>struck</b> them because the captives used to rejoice over every decree that Pharaoh decreed against the Israelites. And the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael taught that the Egyptian servants did so, as well, thus explaining why God said in [...] that God would strike the firstborn of the maidservant who was behind the mill.|$|R

5|$|In late July, a monsoon {{depression}} moved {{across much of}} India, and another monsoon disturbance persisted {{off the coast of}} Pakistan. The interaction between the two systems resulted in heavy rainfall across the region, flooding dozens of villages.

A depression <b>that</b> <b>struck</b> Andhra Pradesh in India killed 21people in early October. Later that month, a tropical depression crossed Thailand from the western Pacific Ocean, contributing to ongoing flooding that killed 19. Once in the Indian Ocean, this system struck southeastern India without causing much damage.

One century earlier, a hurricane formed in the western Caribbean and struck Florida on or before June 3, which was the earliest date for a United States hurricane landfall. However, there is an unofficial hurricane in 1863 <b>that</b> <b>struck</b> the Florida panhandle, killing 110 people. The deadliest official off-season storm was a tropical storm in May 1948, which killed 80 people in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
