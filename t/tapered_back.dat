2500|$|In 1970, {{the sedan}} and coupe {{received}} a restyled rear-end, {{along with a}} new C-pillar shape and rear quarters, {{as well as a}} more massive rear end and bumper. The hardtop was changed to a more sloping roofline with upswept reverse-angle quarter windows, giving them [...] "a somewhat huskier look for 1970". The taillights were integrated into a new loop rear bumper with Rebel spelled out between them. The four-door sedans also had an altered roofline with a slimmer C-pillar and larger, squared-off rear door windows. Similarly as on the coupe, the belt line kicked up beneath the trailing edge of the rear door windows, and then <b>tapered</b> <b>back</b> to the same rear fascia as on the hardtop. The Rebel sedans and hardtop models two inches (51mm) longer than previously. The Rebel station wagons saw no change to their rooflines, doors, and rear fascias.|$|E
5000|$|On sedans, {{the roof}} line showed a slimmer [...] "C-pillar", squared-off rear door windows, and met a belt line that kicked up beneath the {{trailing}} edge of each rear door window. The belt line <b>tapered</b> <b>back</b> {{to the same}} rear fascia as the hardtop coupe's. This rear fascia contained a new ribbed taillight lens that stretched wall-to-wall and included twin square white reverse light lenses in its center.|$|E
50|$|For the 1970 model year, {{the rear}} half of Ambassador hardtop coupes and sedans was treated to an {{overhaul}} {{that was also}} shared by the intermediate 1970 AMC Rebel. On hardtop coupes, this restyling resulted in a sloping roofline that saw upswept reverse-angle quarter windows. The belt line kicked up at the point the hardtop's rear windows swept upward, and <b>tapered</b> <b>back</b> to the fender end, meeting a new loop-type rear bumper.|$|E

50|$|A <b>tapered</b> <b>back</b> {{and sides}} {{generally}} contours {{to the head}} shape; the hair progressively graduates in length from longer hair at the upper portions of the head to shorter hair at the lower edge of hair growth {{on the back and}} sides. There are a variety of tapers possible from short to extra long. Medium and longer tapers can be referred to as trims; however, the word trim is commonly used to request that the hair is trimmed back to the last haircut regardless of the style of taper. The sideburns and the shape and height of the neck edge are important design elements that can affect the appearance of the face, neck, chin, ears, profile and overall style.|$|E
5000|$|The regular haircut, side-parted with <b>tapered</b> <b>back</b> and sides, was {{considered}} a clean cut fashion and preferred by parents and school authorities in the United States. The crew cut, flattop and ivy league were also popular, particularly among {{high school and college}} students. The crew cut style was derived from the military haircuts given to millions of draftees, and was favored by men who wished to appear [...] "establishment" [...] or mainstream. Daily applications of [...] "butch wax" [...] were used to make the short hair stand straight up from the head. Celebrities favoring this style included Steve McQueen, Mickey Mantle and John Glenn. Crew cuts gradually declined in popularity {{by the end of the}} decade; by the mid-1960s, long hair for men had become fashionable.|$|E

5000|$|The Force 1's {{exterior}} {{was designed}} by legendary vehicle designer Henrik Fisker, {{who was responsible for}} the design of the BMW Z8 and Aston Martin DB9, among other automobiles. The Force 1 shares many basic design features with other American sports cars, and in particular the Dodge Viper (with which it shares the basic chasse). It features an elongated hood, long <b>tapered</b> <b>back,</b> and protruding wheels, and is made entirely of carbon fiber. The Force 1 sports a sharp, angled front side, which also sports 6 functional [...] intake and oulet vents. The back side of the car is more curved, and contains a large outlet vent. The Force 1 also features ultra-thin lights in both the front and the rear. The front and roof spoilers, as well as the rear diffuser are made of exposed, polished carbon fiber. The roof spoiler also contains the on-board wi-fi hotspot and a third brake light.|$|E
40|$|A {{concept for}} an {{extremely}} lightweight primary mirror {{for a large}} space telescope is proposed. The mirror uses a sandwich structure composed of aluminum faceplates with an aluminum foam core. Modal analysis indicates that a fundamental frequency of 100 Hz can be obtained for a 6 meter diameter mirror with a <b>tapered</b> <b>back</b> and having a total mass of about 3500 kg. An array of thermal actuators embedded in the mirror corrects for figure errors. Such an active thermal figure control system {{does not have a}} quick response, but is well suited to space applications where disturbances have relatively long time constants. The advantage of thermal actuators is very high reliability, a primary concern in any space system requiring a large number of actuators...|$|E
40|$|Background: In March 2006, Australia {{introduced}} graphic pictorial warnings on cigarette packets. For {{the first}} time, packs include the Quitline number. Objective: To measure the combined effect of graphic cigarette pack warnings and printing the Quitline number on packs on {{calls to the}} Australian Quitline service. Methods: Calls to the Australian Quitline were monitored over 4 years, 2 years {{before and after the}} new packets were introduced. Results: There were twice as many calls to the Quitline in 2006 (the year of introduction), as there were in each of the preceding 2 years. The observed increase in calls exceeds that explained by the accompanying television advertising alone. While call volume <b>tapered</b> <b>back</b> in 2007, it remained at a level higher than before the introduction of new packets. No change was observed in the proportion of first time callers. Conclusion: Introducing graphic cigarette packet warnings and the Quitline number on cigarette packets boosts demand for Quitline services, with likely flow on effects to cessation. C. L. Miller, D.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s {{the company made}} more {{widespread}} use of digital score reels, making multiple player games more practical as most scoring was expressed by cluttered series of lights in the back box. The score reels eventually appeared on single-player games, now known as [...] "wedgeheads" [...] because of their distinctive <b>tapering</b> <b>back</b> box shape. By the 1970s the artwork on Gottlieb games was almost always by Gordon Morison, and the company had begun designing their games with longer 3-inch flippers, now the industry standard.|$|R

40|$|The project 'Green TV' {{has succeeded}} in {{developing}} novel and environmentally sound technologies for a TV set {{on the basis of}} a consideration of the entire product life cycle. Two development lines were pursued in the project and were realized as prototypes. The first is a TV electronics concept based on polysiloxane foil (Loewe subproject). The second TV electronics concept aims at the most far-reaching use of thermoplastics using MID technology (Grundig/Thomson subproject). Further focuses were placed on the development of new energy-saving circuitry concepts, in particular for the main and standby power supply units and for the audio amplifier (Thomson subproject), improving the efficiency of the loudspeaker in conjunction with the use of replenishable raw materials (Harman subproject) and the industrial implementation of picture tube glass recycling in the production of <b>tapered</b> <b>back</b> glass (Philips subproject). The Oeko-Institut developed an assessment methodology that enables strategic decisions early on in the development and manufacturing process. The assessment tool comprises four elements: a life-cycle assessment (LCA), a materials inventory, a contaminant inventory and an economic appraisal. The assessments show that the new developments have the potential to do justice to the requirements of a closed-loop economy, are ecologically purposeful and economically viable. (orig.)

50|$|For lower wind {{resistance}} (which increases fuel efficiency), a teardrop shape is often used. A teardrop is wide and round at the front, <b>tapering</b> at the <b>back.</b> The three-wheel configuration allows the two front wheels {{to create the}} wide round surface of the vehicle. The single rear wheel allows the vehicle to <b>taper</b> at the <b>back.</b> Examples include the Aptera 2 Series and Myers Motors NmG.|$|R
50|$|The S-3 {{featured}} a straight leading edge with the trailing edge <b>tapering</b> <b>back</b> {{to the rear}} of the aircraft, giving it a thumbnail like appearance from the top. The aircraft {{featured a}} tall tricycle landing gear with a small tailwheel in case of over-rotation on takeoff. The fabric covered fuselage was made of welded steel tube with wooden wing ribs. The S-3 differed from the S-2 in that it included a small rudder and elevator at the rear of the fuselage, rather than placing all of the controls on the low aspect ratio wing. The fuselage was sharp-edged with a less streamlined windshield. The dihedral was inadvertently increased compared to the S-2 due to errors in the wing jigs.|$|R
50|$|Further {{development}} {{continued into}} the 1960s into what became the On Mark Marksman. The major difference was the addition of full pressurization. Improvements were also made to the cockpit with the incorporation of Douglas DC-6 flat glass windscreens and cockpit side windows. A replacement fuselage roof structure was added from the new windscreens, <b>tapering</b> <b>back</b> to the original tail section. In January 1961 the first Marksman conversion (registered N100Y) was test flown. A Supplementary Type Certificate was issued in January 1961 and deliveries commenced soon after. With the third Marksman conversion (registered N400E), designated the Marksman C, On Mark further altered the upper fuselage by creating a constant interior height to provide a headroom of about 6 ft in the passenger cabin, fitted for six or eight passengers with toilet and galley.|$|R

5000|$|The glider {{featured}} two wooden parallel trusses {{running along}} its spine, with two widely spaced truss wing spars. Wing ribs {{were attached to}} the spar with varnished shoelaces. The wing shape featured a straight leading edge with the trailing edge <b>tapering</b> <b>back</b> to the tail giving it a distinctive [...] "Half Pie" [...] appearance from the top. The vertical stabilizers were low, but ran {{the full length of}} the fuselage on either side with small canard like control surfaces at the leading edge. The aircraft had conventional landing gear. The pilot sat in a small [...] "bucket" [...] embedded {{in the center of the}} wing. A clear plastic leading edge helped ease the poor downward visibility. The internal volume of the wing was so large that Snyder planned on using Helium to assist in buoyancy, giving it the name [...] "Dirigiplane" [...] in several publications.

50|$|Like {{the earlier}} Starck A.S. 70 Jac single seat light aircraft, the AS-57 was an all wooden machine. The two types {{were similar in}} layout, apart from the accommodation, though the AS-57 was larger all round. The wings were {{straight}} tapered in plan, with rounded tips. The earliest AS-57 had full span trailing edge control surfaces which could be lowered as flaps and operated differentially {{at the same time}} as ailerons, though one later specimen at least had ailerons outboard and separate flaps inboard. Leading edge slots are fitted. The side-by-side configuration seating is enclosed under a bubble canopy which has transparent access panels. At the rear the canopy line drops to the upper fuselage to improve the pilot's view aft. The fuselage <b>tapers</b> <b>back</b> to the tail unit, where the tailplane is mounted just above the upper fuselage surface, braced from below with a pair of struts and placed well forward of the straight leading edge of the fin. The fin has a curved top which merges into a full, rounded rudder. The AS-57 has a fixed conventional undercarriage; some have had wheel fairings, others not. There is a small tailwheel. Various engines have been fitted; the one remaining active aircraft has a 78 kW (105 hp) Walter Minor 4-III but another had a Regnier 67 kW (90 hp) 4E.0, both four cylinder, inverted, air-cooled inlines.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. At present, in the cycloid {{rotational}} indexing processing <b>back</b> <b>taper</b> technique, machining requirements {{were achieved}} mainly through {{the method of}} using cycloid cluster to approach the involute, so that the processing efficiency was hindered. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an improved method that reduces the number of cycloids to enhance the processing efficiency. Firstly, the best approximating cycloid of the involute tooth profile is figured out. Then, the involute is segmented into sections, and the best approximating cycloid on each section is calculated. Each cycloid approaches the involute section to a maximum extent until completing the entire involute approximation. Finally, the simulative processing is carried out. The result demonstrates {{that the number of}} cycloids is one third of the previous and the machining time saves about 64 %.
