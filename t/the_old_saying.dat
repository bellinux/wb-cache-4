She commented, [...] "Pam didn’t have two parents, her father was a drunkard, and she really had to fight for everything she aspired to and achieved. When Bobby married her, he wasn’t marrying milk toast; she was very, very spirited; she was always a good person. I always felt Pam was the moral centre of the programme but she was complicated, and she was fiery, she had opinions, and she was not afraid to voice them. But as the years went by, as JR became more and more evil, the writers felt, and I certainly understand why {{for the benefit of the}} show, that Pam had to become more and more good." [...] When asked about whether she had any input on her characters growth, she said: [...] "Once the show achieved extraordinary world wide fame, I don’t think any of us had much input. [...] You know <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>saying,</b> if it's not broken, don’t fix it; I really believe that Lorimar Television looked upon it as something that was working and they did not want to deviate from the formula." ...|$|E

2500|$|In some parishes in England the centuries-old {{tradition}} of announcing a death on a church bell is upheld. In {{a small village}} most people would be aware of who was ill, and so broadcasting the age and sex of the deceased would identify them. To this end the death was announced by telling (i.e. single blows with the bell down) the sex and then striking off the years. Three blows meant a child, twice three a woman and thrice three a man. After a pause the years were counted out at approximately half-minute intervals. The word teller in some dialects becomes tailor, hence <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "Nine tailors maketh a man".|$|E

2500|$|To GM's product {{planners}} and marketers, {{the fact that}} the Corvette had become known as an [...] "old man's toy" [...] became a prime factor in developing the next generation. Studies showed that about 46 percent of Corvette buyers in 2012, through October, were 55 or older, compared with 22 percent of Audi R8 and 30 percent of Porsche 911 customers. The head of Chevy marketing, Chris Perry, acknowledges that too many people saw it as the car of [...] "the successful plumber." [...] John Fitzpatrick, Corvette's marketing manager said [...] "It's <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Nobody wants to be seen driving an old man's car, but everybody wants to be seen driving a young man's car.' [...] " [...] To counter that perception GM planned to make the new generation C7 more aspirational to younger people. Towards that end, a camouflaged version of the car was made available in the popular video game Gran Turismo 5 in November 2012. [...] As part of the marketing effort associated with the introduction of the new generation, the 2013 Indianapolis 500 utilized a Corvette for the 12th time as its pace car.|$|E

Miranda {{is not to be}} missed. [...] <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>saying</b> goes, it takes talent to be that bad". Another commentator wrote similarly: [...] "It's so awful, it's brilliant." [...] Woman Around Town called Miranda [...] "an atrocious, comedic masterpiece." [...] Perez Hilton praised Miranda's parody of the hit song [...] "Chandelier" [...] as [...] "the crowning achievement of music video parodies ... utterly fantastic". TheaterJones noted that Ballinger: [...] "has hit on a character that reflects the zeitgeist of our time and does it with tongue firmly planted in cheek." [...] In 2015, Playbill concluded: [...] "Miranda Sings is a huge talent. With very demonstrative facial expressions, a unique take on makeup and wardrobe and her almost unbelievable vocal stylings, she cuts an undeniable figure in the world of online music video." [...] The Guardian characterized Miranda's channel as [...] "so bad it's great". Miranda has been compared with such absurd comic creations as Roseanne Roseannadanna and Andy Kaufman's characters, Kimmy Schmidt, [...] "a distaff Napoleon Dynamite" [...] and Pee-wee Herman.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1970, {{shortly after}} the birth of their only child Tamala Georgette, Jones was straitjacketed and {{committed}} to a padded cell at the Watson Clinic in Lakeland, Florida, after a drunken bender; he was kept there to detoxify for 10 days before being released with a prescription for Librium. Jones managed longer stretches of sobriety with Wynette than he had enjoyed in years but as the decade wore on his drinking and erratic behavior worsened, leading to the couple's divorce in 1976. Jones accepted the responsibility for the failure of the marriage but vehemently denied Wynette's allegations in her autobiography that he beat her and fired a shotgun at her. Remarkably, Jones and Wynette continued playing shows and drawing crowds in the years after their divorce, as fans began to see their songs mirroring their stormy relationship. [...] In 1980, they recorded the album Together Again and scored a hit with [...] "Two Story House". Jones also spoke publicly about his hopes for a reconciliation and would jokingly reference Tammy in some of his songs - during performances of his 1981 hit [...] "If Drinkin' Don't Kill Me (Her Memory Will)" [...] he would sing [...] "Tammy's memory will" [...] - but the recrimination continued unabated. [...] After years of sniping, Jones and Wynette appeared to make peace in the 1990s, recording a final album, One, and even touring together again before Wynette's death in 1998. [...] In 1995 Jones told Country Weekly, [...] "Like <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>saying</b> goes, it takes time to heal things and they've been healed quite a while." ...|$|E

[...] During 1979-1980, the team put up 24 wins to only 12 losses. [...] 1980-1981 got even better when UWA tallied a 25-4 overall record.

[...] Although they lost their next tournament game to Delta State, they were rewarded with a trip to the NCAA Regional. [...] A last-second shot rimmed out at the buzzer ending a magical run in Marks' first season.|$|E
