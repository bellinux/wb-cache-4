5|$|All six {{units are}} served by an {{independent}} wet limestone-gypsum flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) plant, which was installed between 1988 and 1996. This diverts gases from the boilers and passes them through a limestone slurry, which removes at least 90% of the sulphur dioxide (SO2). This is equivalent to removing over 250,000 tonnes of SO2 each year. The process requires 10,000 tonnes of limestone a week, sourced from Tunstead Quarry in Derbyshire. A byproduct of the process is gypsum, with 15,000 tonnes produced each week. <b>This</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> {{be used in the}} manufacture of plasterboard. The gypsum is sold exclusively to British Gypsum, and it is transported by rail to their plants at Kirkby Thore (on the Settle-Carlisle Line), East Leake (on the former Great Central Main Line) and occasionally to Robertsbridge (on the Hastings Line). DB Cargo UK transport the gypsum.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the first}} argument, power in excess of {{immediate}} demand is exported to neighbouring countries at lower prices.

25|$|The {{first public}} piped gas supply was to 13 gas lamps, each with three glass globes {{along the length}} of Pall Mall, London in 1807. The credit for <b>this</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> the {{inventor}} and entrepreneur Fredrick Winsor and the plumber Thomas Sugg, who made and laid the pipes. Digging up streets to lay pipes required legislation and this delayed the development of street lighting and gas for domestic use. Meanwhile, William Murdoch and his pupil Samuel Clegg were installing gas lighting in factories and work places, encountering no such impediments.|$|E

25|$|The {{attitude}} of the Legion's soldiers {{was similar to that}} of the Italian Battaglione Azad Hindoustan, which had been of dubious loyalty to the Axis cause—it was disbanded after a mutiny. In one instance, immediately prior to the first deployment of the Legion in the Netherlands in April 1943, after the departure of the 1st Battalion from Königsbrück, two companies within the 2nd Battalion refused to move until convinced by Indian leaders. Even in Asia, where the Indian National Army was much larger and fought the British directly, Bose faced similar obstacles at first. All of <b>this</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> show that many of the men never possessed loyalty to the Nazi cause or ideology; the motivation of the Legion's men was to fight for India's independence. The unit did allegedly participate in atrocities, especially in the Médoc region in July 1944, and in the region of Ruffec and the department of Indre during their retreat, and in addition, some elements of the unit undertook anti-partisan operations in Italy.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{federal funds}} are {{allocated}} to organizations that provide shelter {{and services to}} homeless youth in the United States through two major programs: The Runaway Youth Act, first implemented in 1974 and reauthorized in 2003 as the Runaway, Homeless and Missing Children Protection Act, and the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. According to the Center for American Progress, there are currently no mandates that these funds be provided to shelters that do not discriminate against LGBT youth, meaning some federal funding is provided towards organizations with explicitly anti-gay or anti-transgender stances, {{which can lead to}} denial of care or the sending of youth to sexual orientation conversion therapy. The government spends $4.2 billion annually on homeless assistance programs, but less than 5% of this funding ($195 million) is allocated for homeless children and youth. Only part of <b>this</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> serve unaccompanied homeless youth, and none is specifically allocated to target the needs of LGBT homeless youth. There are currently no federal programs or policies designed to specifically meet the needs of or protect LGBT Homeless youth in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Courtney Conlogue is a 25 {{year old}} American {{professional}} surfer. In {{an interview with}} ESPN she outlined {{what it takes to}} be a professional surfer. [...] "I think some people perceive surfing as just a lifestyle sport. This will be my sixth year competing professionally on the World Tour, and to be involved in something like <b>this</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> show that we do fine-tune our bodies in order to be as strong as we can when we enter the water. During the offseason, I train three to five days a week, and then I train every day in the water. Depending on the way the swell is -- because our sport is based on Mother Nature -- when the waves are good, I surf probably six hours a day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a {{turnover}} in perspectives towards {{the causes of the}} Great famine {{in the mind of the}} Irish-American that can be traced: one that varies from a [...] "mourning religious view", seen in Archbishop Hughes' sermon, to a perspective that shifts the blame towards the British monarchy for its indifference and greed, seen in Cahill's speech in 1860. From that point on, all the following commemorative speeches on the Saint Patrick's Day invoked nationalist themes such as [...] "British hatred" [...] and [...] "heroic struggle" [...] and led the way for the creation of a [...] "new parade" [...] which gained in adherents and absorbed [...] "elements of American patriotism and full-fledged nationalism". The end result was such that the Irish-American community came to regard itself in the 1870s as a community that defined itself by dual loyalties on one hand, and in another as [...] "a unified common organism," [...] which gathered in strength on the basis that they had a common past, [...] "not a religious one but one that centered on the common Irish experience of British oppression and suffering". In other words, <b>this</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> show that the shifting character of commemorative rituals experienced during the Saint Patrick's parade have influenced the development of American culture in a larger sense, since it contributed to enriching its heritage and making of its Irish-American Diaspora a prideful concept to be celebrated and admired.|$|E
2500|$|Hazel Grace Lancaster—a 16-year-old {{with cancer}} that {{has spread to}} her lungs—attends a cancer patient support group at her mother's behest. At first she hesitates because she feels like it has done her nothing. She thinks {{attending}} the support group could be {{the worst part of}} her life, until a particular support meeting, Hazel meets a 17-year-old boy named Augustus Waters, whose osteosarcoma caused him to lose his right leg, which was replaced with a prosthetic. On catching Augustus stare at her, Hazel feels weird. They meet after the Support Group and converse on {{the fact that they were}} not [...] "literally" [...] in the heart of Jesus, but in a basement. When everything seems to go well, Augustus pulls out a cigarette and puts it between his lips. Hazel is disgusted by this and yells at him saying that he's already got cancer and he wants to pay money for more cancer, [...] "Not being able to breathe sucks," [...] she yells. Augustus calmly explains the metaphor, which is, [...] "You put the thing that kills you right between your teeth but you don't give it the power to kill you." [...] Hazel, impressed by <b>this,</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> his place to watch a movie. Augustus is at the meeting to support his friend, Isaac, whose only remaining eye is soon to be removed due to cancer. Hazel and Augustus strike a bond immediately and agree to read each other's favorite novels. Augustus gives Hazel The Price of Dawn, and Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction, a novel written by Peter Van Houten, who lives in Amsterdam, about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels Hazel's own experience. After Augustus finishes reading her book, he is frustrated upon learning that the novel ends abruptly without a conclusion. Hazel explains the novel's author had retreated following the novel's publication and has not been heard from since.|$|E

60|$|Whilst this {{restraint}} {{of foreign}} and domestic education {{was part of an}} horrible and impious system of servitude, the members were well fitted to the body. To render men patient under a deprivation of all the rights of human nature, everything which could give them a knowledge or feeling of those rights was rationally forbidden. To render humanity fit to be insulted, it was fit that it should be degraded. But when we profess to restore men to the capacity for property, it is equally irrational and unjust to deny them the power of improving their minds as well as their fortunes. Indeed, I have ever thought the prohibition of the means of improving our rational nature to be the worst species of tyranny that the insolence and perverseness of mankind ever dared to exercise. <b>This</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> all men, in all situations, to whom education can be denied.|$|E

It's rather like a double ruff at bridge. You--I'm awfully sorry. I shouldn't have used that word. What I meant to say was the policeman makes his arrest, then suggests that the person had better have a bondsman. He gathers in a bondsman, who charges the prisoner four dollars for bailing him out. Two dollars of <b>this</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> the sergeant, who accepts the bail without question, and the policeman takes one. Then the able and intelligent officer says to the prisoner: 'What you want is a lawyer.' 'Right,' says the prisoner, 'if you think so.' Off goes the policeman and gets the lawyer. Five more dollars, of which he gets his share. It's a beautiful system. It might interest the people at dinner to-night to hear about it. I think I'll tell them." ...|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR COLVIN, - <b>This</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> {{say that}} we are all fit, and the place is very bleak and wintry, and up to now has shown no such charms of climate as Davos, but is a place where men eat and where the cattarh, catarrh (cattarrh, or cattarrhh) appears to be unknown. I walk in my verandy in the snaw, sir, looking down over one of those dabbled wintry landscapes that are (to be frank) so chilly to the human bosom, and up at a grey, English - nay, MEHERCLE, Scottish - heaven; and I think it pretty bleak; and the wind swoops at me round the corner, like a lion, and fluffs the snow in my face; and I could aspire to be elsewhere; but yet I do not catch cold, and yet, when I come in, I eat. So that {{hitherto}} Saranac, if not deliriously delectable, has not been a failure; nay, from the mere {{point of view of the}} wicked body, it has proved a success. But I wish I could still get to the woods; alas, NOUS N'IRONS PLUS AU BOIS is my poor song; the paths are buried, the dingles drifted full, a little walk is grown a long one; till spring comes, I fear the burthen will hold good.|$|E

The thought of coming into your presence, and into Mrs. Sheridan's, with such wretched empty and helpless hands {{is in itself}} paralysing; and yet, even as I say that, the sense of how my whole soul is full, even to its being racked and torn, of Wilfred's belovedest image and the splendour and devotion {{in which he is}} all radiantly wrapped and enshrined, [makes me] ask myself if I don't really bring you something, of a sort, in thus giving you the assurance of how absolutely I adored him! Yet who can give you anything that approaches your incomparable sense that he was yours, and you his, to the last possessed and possessing radiance of him? I can't pretend to utter to you words of [...] "consolation"--vainest of dreams: for what is your suffering but the measure of his virtue, his charm and his beauty?--everything we so loved him for. But I see you marked with his glory too, and so intimately associated with his noble legend, with the light of it about you, and about his children, always, and the precious privilege of making him live again whenever one approaches you; convinced as I am that you will rise, in spite of the unspeakable laceration, to the greatness of all this and feel it carry you in a state of sublime privilege. I had sight and some sound of him during an hour of that last leave, just before he went off again; and what he made me then feel, and what his face seemed to say, amid that cluster of relatives in which I was the sole outsider (of which too I was extraordinarily proud,) is beyond all expression. I don't know why I presume to say such things--I mean poor things only of mine, to you, all stricken and shaken as you are--and then again I know how any touch of his noble humanity must be unspeakably dear to you, and that you'll go on getting the fragrance of them wherever he passed. I think with unutterable tenderness of those days of late last autumn when you were in the little house off the Edgware Road, and the humour and gaiety and vivid sympathy of his talk (about his then beginnings and conditions) made me hang spellbound on his lips. But what memories are these not to you, and how can one speak to you at all without stirring up the deeps? Well we are all in them with you, and with his mother--and may I speak of his father?--and with his children, and we cling to you and cherish you as never before.
