25|$|The Pauli {{exclusion}} principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>values</b> {{of all four}} quantum numbers.

25|$|Oswald's {{paternal}} grandfather, Theodor Spengler (1806–76), was a metallurgical inspector (Hütteninspektor) in Altenbrak. Oswald's father, Bernhard Spengler, {{held the}} position of a postal secretary (Postsekretär) and was a hard-working man with a marked dislike of intellectualism, who tried to instil <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>values</b> and attitudes in his son.|$|E
2500|$|The {{quantum number}} [...] first {{appeared}} in the Bohr model where it determines the radius of each circular electron orbit. In modern quantum mechanics however, [...] determines the mean distance of the electron from the nucleus; all electrons with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>value</b> of n lie at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> average distance. For this reason, orbitals with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>value</b> of n are said to comprise a [...] "shell". Orbitals with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>value</b> of n and also <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>value</b> of are even more closely related, and are said to comprise a [...] "subshell".|$|R

25|$|The {{reason this}} gives a stable {{distribution}} {{is that the}} characteristic function for the sum of two random variables equals {{the product of the}} two corresponding characteristic functions.

25|$|Some groups {{participate}} in more events then others. Some groups in different communities get together more or host more small events.

Then {{it would still}} be Boolean algebra, and {{moreover}} operating on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>values.</b> However it would not be identical to our original Boolean algebra because now we find ∨ behaving the way ∧ used to do and vice versa.

He then quotes a different value from Zij Al Mumtahan, which was done during Al-Ma'mun's reign, as 1 degree for every 66 solar years. He also quotes the aforementioned Al-Battani's Zij Al-Sabi' as adjusting coordinates for stars by 11 degrees and 10 minutes of arc {{to account for}} the difference between Al-Battani's time and Ptolemy's.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, Brown {{returned}} {{once more}} to Burnley when he was appointed as manager. His arrival back at the club was not well received {{by some of the}} senior players at Burnley who were unhappy in anticipation of being managed by such a figure of moral integrity.

25|$|The {{problem is}} that unless we impose very strong {{mathematical}} restrictions, we cannot say that this Cobb-Douglas production function for sector i plus one for sector j (plus that for sector k, etc.) {{adds up to a}} Cobb-Douglas production function for {{the economy as a whole}} (with K and L being the sum of all of the different sectoral values). In short, for the sum of Cobb-Douglas production functions to equal a Cobb-Douglas, the production functions for all of the different sectors have to have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>values</b> of A and a.|$|E
25|$|According to Fanti and Moroni, after {{comparing}} the histograms of 256 different grey levels, {{it was found}} that the image obtained with a bas-relief has grey values included between 60 and 256 levels, but it is much contrasted with wide areas of white saturation (levels included between 245 and 256) and lacks of intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200). The face image on the Shroud instead has grey tonalities that vary in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>values</b> field (between 60 and 256), but the white saturation is much less marked and the histogram is practically flat in correspondence of the intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200).|$|E
25|$|In auction pinochle, players bid for {{the points}} they predict their hand could earn. The highest bidder earns the right to declare the trump suit. One of the players, usually the player {{to the left of}} the dealer, or the dealer themselves, is obligated to open with a first bid. The size of bids is based on the point scale and number of decks used; traditionally, points are in {{multiples}} of 10, thus a minimum opening bid might be agreed to be 100 or 250. However, many alternate scoring rules drop the unnecessary trailing zero; in that case, bids of 10 and 25, respectively, have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>values.</b> When a player has the turn to bid, the player may either bid or pass.|$|E

25|$|The Jordanian Brotherhood {{has formed}} its own {{political}} party, the Islamic Action Front. In 1989 {{they become the}} largest group in parliament, with 23 out of 80 seats, and 9 other Islamist allies. A Brother {{was elected president of}} the National Assembly and the cabinet formed in January 1991 included several MBs. Its radicalization which calls for more militant support for Hamas in Palestine has come into direct conflict with its involvement in the parliament and overall political process. The Brotherhood claimed its acceptance of democracy and the democratic process but only within their own groups. There is a high degree of dissent amongst Brotherhood leaders who do not share <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>values</b> therefore undermining its acceptance and commitment to democracy.|$|E
25|$|A common {{aspect of}} {{recovery}} {{is said to}} be the presence of others who believe in the person's potential to recover, and who stand by them. While mental health professionals can offer a particular limited kind of relationship and help foster hope, relationships with friends, family and the community are said to often be of wider and longer-term importance. Others who have experienced similar difficulties, who may be on a journey of recovery, can be of particular importance. Those who share <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>values</b> and outlooks more generally (not just in the area of mental health) may also be particularly important. It is said that one-way relationships based on being helped can actually be devaluing, and that reciprocal relationships and mutual support networks can be of more value to self-esteem and recovery.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{notion of}} {{duplicated}} work relies on noticing {{that after the}} first reduction of I I is done, {{the value of the}} other I I can be determined, because they have the same structure (and in fact they have exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>values),</b> and result from a common ancestor. Such similar structures can each be assigned a label that can be tracked across reductions. If a name is assigned to the redex that produces all the resulting II terms, and then all duplicated occurrences of II can be tracked and reduced in one go. However, it is not obvious that a redex will produce the II term. Identifying the structures that are similar in different parts of a lambda term can involve a complex algorithm and can possibly have a complexity equal to the history of the reduction itself.|$|E

500|$|Although female conservatives such as Hannah More excoriated Wollstonecraft personally, they {{actually}} shared many of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>values.</b> As the scholar Anne Mellor has shown, both More and Wollstonecraft wanted a society founded on [...] "Christian virtues of rational benevolence, honesty, personal virtue, {{the fulfillment of}} social duty, thrift, sobriety, and hard work". During the early 1790s, many writers within British society were engaged in an intense debate regarding the position of women in society. For example, the respected poet and essayist Anna Laetitia Barbauld and Wollstonecraft sparred back and forth; Barbauld published several poems responding to Wollstonecraft's work and Wollstonecraft commented on them in footnotes to the Rights of Woman. The work also provoked outright hostility. The bluestocking Elizabeth Carter was unimpressed with the work. Thomas Taylor, the Neoplatonist translator {{who had been a}} landlord to the Wollstonecraft family in the late 1770s, swiftly wrote a satire called A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes: if women have rights, why not animals too? ...|$|E
500|$|The Wiggles used many of {{the same}} {{promotion}} techniques in the US that they had used in Australia, and chose to keep their concerts simple and maintain <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>values</b> that were successful in Australia.

[...] In 2000, when video sales took off in the US, Lyrick began to distribute Wiggles videos and advertised them by including Wiggles shorts as trailers in their Barney videos, which, as Anthony Field stated, [...] "pushed us over the edge". [...] At first, the group's videos were distributed in boutique stores such as FAO Schwarz and Zany Brainy, and on-line. [...] According to Paul Field, they entered the mass media market when their videos became top-sellers at Amazon.com, and their first two videos, Yummy Yummy and Wiggle Time, landed in the top ten at Amazon.com.
