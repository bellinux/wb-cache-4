5|$|Phocas's rule lacked {{legitimacy}} and quickly {{came to be}} resented by the populace and the elites of the Byzantine Empire. What prestige he had further eroded when the Persian shah Khosrau II (r. 590–628) declared war, and when the Byzantine forces began to suffer their first defeats. According to a later tradition, Priscus {{sent a letter to}} the Exarch of Africa, Heraclius the Elder, urging him to revolt. This is probably a later invention, but if true, it would indicate the level of dissent even within Constantinople. Whatever the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter,</b> in 608 Africa rose in revolt, and the Exarch's son, Heraclius the Younger, was dispatched against Constantinople at the head of a fleet. Unopposed by Phocas's forces, he landed at the suburb of Hebdomon on October 3 and marched to the capital, where pro-Heraclian riots had broken out. At this juncture, Priscus pretended to be ill, and withdrew to his mansion at the Boraïdou quarter, where he assembled the excubitores and his own retainers (bucellarii), thus depriving Phocas of his main source of armed support. He is also recorded by John of Nikiu to have safeguarded the women of Heraclius's family from retribution by Phocas.|$|E

25|$|Lastly, if a {{statement}} is being offered for its truth—meaning that its relevance {{depends upon the}} jury believing {{the substance of the}} statement—then it is being offered to prove the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> asserted therein. If {{a statement}} is relevant for any other purpose other than proving the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> asserted therein, then the statement will not be considered hearsay under the Federal Rules of Evidence.|$|E
25|$|In this example, simple logic tells {{that there}} is a difference: while the first {{statement}} may be true, it does not assert anything about the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> stated.

Sun Lutang was a student of both Guo Yunshen and Cheng Tinghua so this stance on the subject {{seems to be one}} of the most accurate.|$|E

60|$|Once <b>the</b> creatures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest held a great {{convention}} and appointed a commission consisting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most illustrious scientists among {{them to go}} forth, clear beyond the forest {{and out into the}} unknown and unexplored world, to verify <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matters</b> already taught in their schools and colleges and also to make discoveries. It was the most imposing enterprise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kind the nation had ever embarked in. True, the government had once sent Dr. Bull Frog, with a picked crew, to hunt for a northwesterly passage through the swamp to <b>the</b> right-hand corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood, and had since sent out many expeditions to hunt for Dr. Bull Frog; but they never could find him, and so government finally gave him up and ennobled his mother to show its gratitude for the services her son had rendered to science. And once government sent Sir Grass Hopper to hunt for <b>the</b> sources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rill that emptied into the swamp; and afterward sent out many expeditions to hunt for Sir Grass, and at last they were successful--they found his body, but if he had discovered the sources meantime, he did not let on. So government acted handsomely by deceased, and many envied his funeral.|$|R

Later, the Devil indicates that Sam is his son, although the father who raised Sam, Mr. Oliver, tells Sam that the deal with the Devil will not allow him to tell Sam the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter.</b> All other characters who know about the claim assume that Sam, though kindhearted, is indeed the Devil's son.|$|E
25|$|The {{discipline}} of surgery {{was put on}} a sound, scientific footing during the Age of Enlightenment in Europe. An important figure in this regard was the English surgical scientist, John Hunter, generally regarded {{as the father of}} modern scientific surgery. He brought an empirical and experimental approach to the science and was renowned around Europe for the quality of his research and his written works. Hunter reconstructed surgical knowledge from scratch; refusing to rely on the testimonies of others, he conducted his own surgical experiments to determine the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter.</b> To aid comparative analysis, he built up a collection of over 13,000 specimens of separate organ systems, from the simplest plants and animals to humans.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though both}} Junker Ove and Hilda suspect {{that they are}} in the wrong place in their lives as the story begins, they are not able to act on their own initiative. The dream gives Hilda an inkling of this other life, and the dream by the hill gives Junker Ove an idea about the ideal woman, but it is the {{crucifix}} and the golden goblet, two Christian symbols, which reveal the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter.</b> Christianity is to be thanked for the restoration of harmony. Junker Ove gets his Hilda, and the promise of gold persuades Sir Mogens to be united with Birthe who, in a modern interpretation, represents the young woman with the unruly disposition unable to conform to society's norms. She is handed over - troll for gold - to Sir Mogens in order to continue her life somewhere else completely.|$|E
2500|$|As Jenkins noted, <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stories <b>mattered</b> {{less than}} their {{resonance}} with voter fears. [...] Three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most famously recorded instances of [...] "Loony Left" [...] activities, [...] "Baa Baa White Sheep", renaming manhole covers, and [...] "black bin-liner bags" [...] were myths, outright fabrications by the press. Others stories, such as reports that London councils had insisted that homosexuals be placed at <b>the</b> heads <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waiting lists for council housing and that London councils had spent £500,000 on [...] "24 super-loos for gypsies" [...] {{were found to be}} highly misleading upon investigation by the Media Research Group of Goldsmiths' College, University of London.|$|R
50|$|In proof theory, {{particularly}} <b>the</b> proof theory <b>of</b> constructive mathematics {{based on}} the Curry-Howard correspondence, one often identifies a mathematical proposition with its set of proofs (if any). A given proposition may have many proofs, of course; according to <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> proof irrelevance, normally only <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposition <b>matters,</b> not which proof was used. However, the Curry-Howard correspondence can turn proofs into algorithms, and differences between algorithms are often important. So proof theorists may prefer to identify a proposition with a setoid of proofs, considering proofs equivalent {{if they can be}} converted into one another through beta conversion or the like.|$|R

He could now hear voices, and <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>matter</b> began to dawn upon him. Walking on towards the opening, Smith discerned on his left hand a heap of earth, and before him a flight of stone steps which the removed earth had uncovered, leading down under the edifice. It was {{the entrance to a}} large family vault, extending under the north aisle.|$|R
25|$|Wilson {{recommended}} Kiggell as {{his successor}} and thought {{the appointment of}} William Robertson “a tremendous gamble”, writing “my heart sinks when I think what it all may mean to the College & this house”. He may have felt that Robertson’s lack of private means did not suit him for a position which required entertaining. Robertson visited Camberley with Lord Kitchener (28 July 1910), who criticised Wilson; {{this may have been}} one of the causes of the poor relations between Wilson and Kitchener in August 1914. Edmonds later told a story of how Wilson had, perhaps as a joke or wanting to draw attention to Robertson’s shortage of money, left a bill for £250 for furniture and improvements to the Commandant’s residence, and that Wilson’s predecessor Rawlinson, when approached by Robertson for advice, had been amused and had commented that many of these improvements had been made by his own wife or by previous Commandants. Whatever the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter,</b> relations between Wilson and Robertson deteriorated thereafter.|$|E
25|$|After a few hours, the Polish and Russian {{artillery}} quieted. Within 12 {{hours with}} Russian-backed artillery fire, the infantry began advancing onto the Polish centre. Under mass artillery fire and a Russian attack, panic was induced among the Polish recruits who began escaping. After some time, Józef Poniatowski reviewed the Polish position. He organised a new battalion from the Potocki regiment and with support of battalion ordnance Ostrogoski began a counterattack. Russian infantry under fire of artillery and a Polish counterattack began withdrawal incurring heavy losses. Meanwhile, another Russian infantry unit secured {{the village of}} Zieleńce and opened fire on Polish formations. Poniatowski sent a formation of cavalry, but failed. After the village was set on fire, the Russians withdrew. Meanwhile, the Russians moved artillery fire onto Polish right wing on cavalry. The soldiers felt panic. At that moment, Cossacks began a charge. At beginning, that charge was stopped by field squadrons of Mokronowski brigade cavalry, but in formation of Regiment Buławy Koronnej panic ensued the rear squadrons of Mokronowski brigade. The panic of the Polish cavalry was stopped by Sanguszko and other officers. After reorganisation, Polish cavalry with support of part Lubowidzki cavalry brigade from second line began a countercharge. During this charge, the Polish cavalry destroyed the Russian cavalry and began to rally. Poniatowski sent an order to support the rally to Czapski commander of second line cavalry right wing. Czapski refused to obey because the order was not written. In <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> of his decision {{was that he was}} follower of the pro-Russian Targowica Confederation. During this time, a Russian regiment of grenadiers from Ekatierinoslav attacked Polish left wing. Poniatowski sent battalions from Potocki and Malczewski regiments. After decimating grenadiers under artillery and rifle fire, the Russians advance collapsed.|$|E
500|$|Whitlam remains well {{remembered for}} the {{circumstances}} of his dismissal. It is a legacy he did little to efface; he wrote a 1979 book, The <b>Truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Matter</b> (the title is a play on that of Kerr's 1978 memoir, Matters for Judgment) and devoted part of his subsequent book, Abiding Interests, to {{the circumstances of}} his removal.

5000|$|Proponents of {{religious}} pluralism in Islam commonly {{refer to a}} hadith where Muhammad said that: There are as many paths to God as there are human breaths. In several Surah, Quran asks Muslims to remain steadfast with Islam, and not yield to <b>the</b> vain desires <b>of</b> other religions and unbelievers. These verses have been interpreted to imply pluralism in religions. For example, Surah Al-Ma'idah verses 47 through 49 state: Let <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gospel judge by what Allah hath revealed therein. If any do fail to judge by <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> what Allah hath revealed, they are no better than those who rebel. To thee We sent the Scripture in truth, confirming the scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety: so judge between them by what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging from the Truth that hath come to thee. To each among you have we prescribed a law and an open way. If Allah had so willed, He would have made you a single people, but His plan is to test you in what He hath given you: so strive as in a race in all virtues. <b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> you all is to Allah; it is He that will show you <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matters</b> in which ye dispute; And this (He commands): Judge thou between them by what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they beguile thee from any of that (teaching) which Allah hath sent down to thee.

50|$|In {{political}} science, the Copenhagen School adopts {{speech act}} {{as a form of}} felicitous speech act (or simply 'facilitating conditions'), whereby the speaker, often politicians or players, act in accordance to the truth but in preparation for the audience to take action in <b>the</b> directions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> player that are driven or incited by the act. This forms an observable framework under a specified subject <b>matter</b> from <b>the</b> player, and the audience who are 'under-theorised would remain outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> framework itself, and would benefit from being both brought in and drawn out.' It is because the audience would not be informed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intentions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> player, except to focus on <b>the</b> display <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speech act itself. Therefore, in <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> player, <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subject <b>matter</b> is irrelevant except the result produced via the audience.|$|R
40|$|This thesis studied how the Aceh {{conflict}} is explained in scientific literature. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis was {{to construct a}} post-modern understanding of scientific inquiries following neo-pragmatist understanding <b>of</b> scientific research. <b>The</b> object <b>of</b> my research was to analyse the scientific narratives regarding the conflict between <b>the</b> government <b>of</b> Indonesia and <b>the</b> separatist group Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka –GAM). The analysis focused on five scientific narratives and {{the purpose was to}} find out why the Aceh conflict emerged. <b>The</b> second chapter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis examined various paradigms in peace research that are or continue to be influential in the field. It distinguished the theories into two groups, traditional and social constructivist perspectives and further argued that although <b>the</b> discipline <b>of</b> peace studies has cemented its position within social sciences, the field, nevertheless, is very fragmented. The third chapter constructed a post-modern perspective on scientific research. It was argued in chapter three how language in scientific inquiries can be understood in a dual sense. On the one hand, language is utilised by the scholars to represent the world and, on the other hand, academics apply it in order to cope with the world. The fourth chapter argued that scientific inquiries can be meaningfully seen as narratives or stories. The narrative approach was clarified as the method in this thesis. It was examined how narratives are generally structured and how an additional element in narratives was the rhetoric. The final chapter analysed five scientific narratives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aceh conflict. The first narrative presented a historical analysis, second was based on greed-grievances paradigm, third followed a wide array of Social Constructivist literature, fourth examined a positivist perspective and finally fifth gave an anthropological perspective. The analysis showed how none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interpretations succeeded in giving practical suggestions for resolving the conflict. Therefore, <b>the</b> tradition <b>of</b> how a theory meets practice, which is highly valued in peace and conflict research, has either been broken or the analysed conflict by the researchers was so intractable that scholars did not find any means to cope with it. The most interesting element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inquiry was to locate the story with other stories and how they connect with each other. The analysis showed how even the most recent scientific narratives did not provide any valuable new insights to the conflict. It would be presumptuous to claim for <b>the</b> utter insignificance <b>of</b> these studies but I would like to question <b>the</b> practical usability <b>of</b> them. In other words, instead <b>of</b> describing <b>the</b> conflict ever more clearly or attempting to find <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matters,</b> <b>the</b> focus could lay on the pragmatic questions. The analysis also showed that none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presented narratives offered any precise means to solve the conflict. What is clearly lacking in these suggestions is the Rortyan utopia; a clear and practical vision of a better future world.

5000|$|It {{must also}} be remembered that by [...] "dogma" [...] Sextus means [...] "assent to {{something}} non-evident adēlos" [...] (PH I, 16). And by [...] "non-evident" [...] he means things which lie beyond appearances (and thus beyond proof or disproof), such as the existence and/or nature of causality, time, motion, or even proof itself. Thus, the skeptic will, for example, believe the proposition that [...] "Dion is in the room" [...] if sense-data and ordinary reasoning led to <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> such a belief. On the other hand, {{if he were to}} [...] "strongly" [...] assert that Dion was [...] "really" [...] in the room, then he may be met with opposing arguments of equal psychological force against the self-same proposition and experience mental disquietude as a result. Thus, the Pyrrhonian does not assent to the proposition [...] "Dion is in the room" [...] in a dogmatic way as that would purport to describe a non-evident reality which lies beyond the [...] "appearance" [...] phainomenon of Dion being in the room. The Skeptic simply goes along with the appearance just as [...] "a child is persuaded by...his teacher." [...] (PH I, 229). It is for this reason then that Sextus says the Skeptic lives undogmatically in accordance with appearances and also according to a [...] "fourfold regimine of life" [...] which includes <b>the</b> guidance <b>of</b> nature, compulsion of pathe (feelings), laws and customs, and instruction in arts and crafts. The Skeptic follows this course of life while suspending judgment concerning <b>the</b> ultimate <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> non-evident <b>matters</b> debated in philosophy and the sciences (PH I, 17). Thus, the Pyrrhonian Skeptic is one who believes possibly many things, but yet does not dogmatize about those beliefs since he finds no ultimate justification for them. Thus, the Pyrrhonian achieves ataraxia not by casting certain judgments about appearances but rather through his refined ability to [...] "oppose appearances to judgments" [...] such that he is [...] "brought firstly to a state of mental suspense and next to a state of 'unperturbedness' or 'quietude.'"
