This chapter also contains analysis of the entrance and exit strategy of <b>the</b> quantitative <b>easing.</b> In <b>the</b> third chapter, there is an econometric model estimated by ordinary least squares method with robust errors.

The hypothesis has been rejected as <b>the</b> quantitative <b>easing</b> does not have statistically significant effect on any selected long-term bonds...|$|R

Eighty percent of Gaza's population is aid-dependent. Allowing more aid in is perpetuating this dependency and not addressing the issue of self- sufficiency or the root causes of the crisis. What have not been addressed by <b>the</b> <b>easing</b> of <b>the</b> closure are the issues of exports as well as the limited number of crossings open to facilitate the flow of goods. Operation Cast Lead destroyed at least 60,000 homes and structures which need to be urgently repaired and rebuilt. <b>The</b> <b>easing</b> of <b>the</b> blockade is not addressing this adequately." ...|$|R

A 2009 descriptive review provided preliminary evidence that PECS is easily learned by most individuals with autism, provides communication to those {{with little or no}} functional speech, and has some limited positive impact on social interaction and challenging behaviours. A study that compared the use of a speech generating device to a picture exchange system found that both were reasonable options for children with autism, as <b>the</b> <b>ease</b> and speed of acquisition of each system was similar.|$|E

5|$|Laws {{dealing with}} digital {{evidence}} {{are concerned with}} two issues: integrity and authenticity. Integrity is ensuring {{that the act of}} seizing and acquiring digital media does not modify the evidence (either the original or the copy). Authenticity refers to the ability to confirm the integrity of information; for example that the imaged media matches the original evidence. <b>The</b> <b>ease</b> with which digital media can be modified means that documenting the chain of custody from the crime scene, through analysis and, ultimately, to the court, (a form of audit trail) is important to establish the authenticity of evidence.|$|E
5|$|P. moranensis {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{commonly}} cultivated Pinguicula, in part due to its large size, large and pretty flowers, and <b>the</b> <b>ease</b> with which it can be grown as a container plant. Most growers use an open soil mix composed of some combination of washed sand, perlite, vermiculite, peat moss, gypsum and/or decomposed granite. Soil should be kept well drained, but watered regularly with distilled water in the summer and only very rarely once the plant enters its winter rosette. The species grows readily on well-lit windowsills, under fluorescent lights, or in warm to hot greenhouses.|$|E
