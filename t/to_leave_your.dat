25|$|After {{the first}} double murder, some parents warned their {{children}} about being out late. The second double murder shocked {{the city and}} curfews were set for businesses. The height of the town's hysteria snowballed after the murder of Virgil Starks. The Texarkana Gazette stated on Sunday, May 5, that the killer might strike again at any moment, at any place and at any one. Before, it was normal <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>your</b> house unlocked, but soon residents started locking doors, pulling down shades, blocking windows, and arming themselves with guns. Some people would nail sheets over their windows or nail the window down. Some used screened-door braces as window guards. The next day after Starks' death, several residents bought firearms and locks. Stores sold out of locks, guns, ammunition, and window shades and Venetian blinds. Other items that sold well included window sash locks, screen door hooks, night latches, and other protective devices.|$|E

Some songs differed significantly from their original versions; for example, [...] "Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard" [...] featured more prominent Latin elements and included a salsa break, while the folk rock [...] "Kodachrome" [...] was set as a harder rock song and played together with the Chuck Berry classic [...] "Maybellene" [...] as a medley. The military rhythm of [...] "50 Ways <b>to</b> <b>Leave</b> <b>Your</b> Lover" [...] was replaced with a Latin arrangement that included brass.|$|E

Stacey Anderson of Spin commented that its first disc [...] "meanders over [...] down-tempo cuts" [...] and called ...Sasha [...] "an intriguing but diluted direction". The Village Voices Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond felt that the I Am... disc lacks cohesion, but complimented [...] "Sasha Fierce as [...] "brassy, big-headed, confrontational, and witty," [...] and stated, [...] "each incendiary track challenges you <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>your</b> inhibitions at coat-check." [...] Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone noted that its slow songs are [...] "full of bland self-affirmation and saggy lines", but wrote that [...] "the [...] "Sasha" [...] disc boasts Beyoncé's most adventurous music yet". Colin McGuire of PopMatters called the album [...] "a little rough around the edges at times" [...] and viewed its Sasha Fierce disc as [...] "a far more compelling trip down dance-lane". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the album offers [...] "two compelling sides" [...] of Beyoncé and stated: [...] "The collection {{might have been better}} served had she edited it down to one disc, rather than belabor what ultimately seems like a marketing gimmick. And while fans will surely speculate, there's little in the lyrics that feels more revealing than previous emotional fire-starters." [...] Sasha Frere-Jones from The New Yorker found the album to be [...] "something of a mess", mostly because the alter ego [...] "trips on the idea of redefinition".|$|E
500|$|Meredith's {{performances}} for Northwich {{gained the}} attention of several other clubs in the Football League. Bolton Wanderers full-back Di Jones, a former Chirk player, spoke with him about a possible move, but Bolton secretary J.J. Bentley felt Meredith was too inexperienced and his frame too slight. Lawrence Furniss, an official at Ardwick, had first noticed him while refereeing a Northwich match. Meredith also played in both meetings between the clubs that season. Later in 1894, Ardwick, by then known as Manchester City, vigorously pursued Meredith's signature. Two club officials travelled to Wales to meet the player. One was secretary-manager Joshua Parlby, the other either Furniss or chairman John Chapman. The pair were met with suspicion. Anecdotes by contemporary figures suggest they were initially chased away by locals, and were only allowed to speak to Meredith after they bought drinks for his mining colleagues. Meredith {{did not wish to}} abandon life in Chirk. His mother was particularly against the idea: [...] "It is all very well for you gentlemen <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>your</b> big cities and come to our villages to steal our boys away... Our boys are happy and healthy, satisfied with their work and innocent amusements... if Billy takes my advice he will stick to his work and play football for his own amusement when work is finished." [...] Meredith did eventually sign for Manchester City, but as an amateur. He continued to work at the pit for at least a year, commuting back and forth for matches.|$|E

2500|$|History {{also that}} the {{smallest}} child, Matei (12 years old) was so frightened after seeing the bloodbath and the heads of his three brothers that he started crying and asking his father to let him renounce Christianity and convert to Islam as the Sultan Ahmed III had demanded.

It is better to die a thousand times than <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>your</b> ancient faith just to live few more years on earth." [...] Matei listened and offered his head.

2500|$|A rarer form is {{the verbal}} noun with the ending -en (not to be {{confused}} with the definite article) which is used when the infinitive carries a pronoun, an indefinite article or an adjective: hans evindelige skrigen var enerverende, [...] "his never-ending crying was enervating", der var en løben og råben på gangene, [...] "people ran and cried in the hall". This use has a connotation of something habitual and is often used in a negative sense. It is used in formal information like Henstillen af cykler forbudt, [...] "It is prohibited <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>your</b> bike here." [...] Whereas the infinitive is accompanied with adjectives in the neuter (det er svært at flyve, [...] "it is difficult to fly"), the verbal noun governs the common gender. Due to the rarity of this form, Danes often mistakenly write Henstilling af cykler forbudt (lit. [...] "Recommendation of bikes prohibited") instead, using a more familiar word form.|$|E

Should anger, or avarice, or fleshly desire violently assail the frail vessel of your soul, look at the star, call upon Mary. If troubled {{on account of the}} heinousness of your sins, distressed at the filthy state of your conscience, and terrified at the thought of the awful judgment to come, you are beginning to sink into the bottomless gulf of sadness and to be swallowed in the abyss of despair, then think of Mary.

2500|$|Highly anticipated, Still Crazy After All These Years was {{his next}} album. Released in October 1975 and {{produced}} by Simon and Phil Ramone, it marked another departure. The {{mood of the}} album was darker, as he wrote and recorded it {{in the wake of}} his divorce. Preceded by the feel-good duet with Phoebe Snow, [...] "Gone at Last" [...] (a Top 25 hit) and the Simon & Garfunkel reunion track [...] "My Little Town" [...] (a No. 9 on Billboard), the album was his only No. 1 on the Billboard charts to date. The 18th Grammy Awards named it the Album of the Year and Simon's performance the year's Best Male Pop Vocal. With Simon in the forefront of popular music, the third single from the album, [...] "50 Ways <b>to</b> <b>Leave</b> <b>Your</b> Lover" [...] reached the top spot of the Billboard charts, his only single to reach No. 1 on this list. Also, on May 3, 1976, Simon put together a benefit show at Madison Square Garden to raise money for the New York Public Library. Phoebe Snow, Jimmy Cliff and the Brecker Brothers also performed. The concert produced over $30,000 for the Library.|$|E

This is truly commendable. However, as much as I would like to send troops to escort you over, I do not think it is a good idea. If I send too few troops, {{they will not be able}} to protect you. If I send too many troops, the Wu government will find it suspicious. I think you should secretly make plans for yourself first and act accordingly when the time comes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Simon has {{appeared}} on Saturday Night Live (SNL), either as host or musical guest, 14 times. On one appearance in the late 1980s, he worked with his political namesake, Illinois Senator Paul Simon. Simon's most recent SNL appearance on a Saturday night was on the March 9, 2013 episode hosted by Justin Timberlake {{as a member of}} the Five-Timers Club. In one SNL skit from 1986 (when he was promoting Graceland), Simon plays himself, waiting in line with a friend to get into a movie. He amazes his friend by remembering intricate details about prior meetings with passers-by, but draws a complete blank when approached by Art Garfunkel, despite the latter's numerous memory prompts. Simon appeared alongside George Harrison as musical guest on the Thanksgiving Day episode of SNL (November 20, 1976). The two performed [...] "Here Comes the Sun" [...] and [...] "Homeward Bound" [...] together, while Simon performed [...] "50 Ways <b>to</b> <b>Leave</b> <b>Your</b> Lover" [...] solo earlier in the show. On that episode, Simon opened the show performing [...] "Still Crazy After All These Years" [...] in a turkey outfit, since Thanksgiving was the following week. About halfway through the song, Simon tells the band to stop playing because of his embarrassment. After giving a frustrating speech to the audience, he leaves the stage, backed by applause. Lorne Michaels positively greets him backstage, but Simon is still upset, yelling at him because of the humiliating turkey outfit. This is one of SNLs most played sketches. [...] Simon closed the 40th anniversary SNL show on February 15, 2015, with a performance of [...] "Still Crazy After All These Years," [...] sans turkey outfit. [...] Simon also played a snippet of [...] "I've Just Seen a Face" [...] with Sir Paul McCartney during the special's introductory sequence.|$|E
