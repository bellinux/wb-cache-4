25|$|ROS-related {{oxidation}} of DNA {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of mutations, which can produce several types of DNA damage, including non-bulky (8-oxoguanine and formamidopyrimidine) and bulky (cyclopurine and etheno adducts) base modifications, abasic sites, non-conventional single-strand breaks, protein-DNA adducts, and intra/interstrand DNA crosslinks. It has been estimated that endogenous ROS produced via normal cell metabolism modify approximately 20,000 bases of DNA per day in a single cell. 8-oxoguanine is the most abundant among various oxidized nitrogeneous bases observed. During DNA replication, DNA polymerase mispairs 8-oxoguanine with adenine, leading to a G→T <b>transversion</b> <b>mutation.</b> The resulting genomic instability directly contributes to carcinogenesis.

We have used the plasmid-borne bacteriophage P 22 mnt gene as a target to determine the types of mutations produced in mutL 25 and mutD 5 strains. Of 60 mutations identified from mutL 25 cells, 52 were transition mutations and of these the AT [...] GC subset predominated (40 out of 52).

40|$|Cigarette smoking {{has been}} inconsistently {{associated}} with colon cancer risk. To evaluate {{the hypothesis that}} smoking is primarily linked to a specific colon tumor subgroup(s), we assessed associations between smoking and the occurrence of mutations in the APC, K-ras and p 53 genes, p 53 overexpression, and microsatellite instability (MSI) in a Dutch population-based case-control study on sporadic colon carcinomas. The study population consisted of 176 cases and 249 controls. Smoking status (never, ever), number of cigarettes smoked per day (never, 30), and years since first started smoking (never, {{less than or equal}} to 35, > 35) were all evaluated. Cigarette smoking status was significantly differently related to p 53 overexpression-positive (p 53 (pos)) tumors compared with p 53 overexpression-negative (p 53 (neg)) tumors (p 53 (pos) versus p 53 (neg), OR 0. 4, 95 % CI 0. 2 - 0. 9), as well as to tumors with <b>transversion</b> <b>mutations</b> in APC, K-ras or p 53 (transv(+)) compared with tumors without <b>transversion</b> <b>mutations</b> in one of these genes (transv(-)) (transv(+) versus transv-, OR 2. 5, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 5. 9). Positive associations were observed with p 53 (neg) tumors and transv(+) tumors when compared with the population-based controls (ever versus transv(-), OR 1. 5, 95 % CI 0. 9 - 2. 8 and OR 2. 2, 95 % CI 0. 9 - 5. 6, respectively), inverse associations with p 53 (pos) tumors and transv(-) tumors (ever versus never, OR 0. 5, 95 % CI 0. 3 - 1. 0 and OR 0. 8, 95 % CI 0. 5 - 1. 3, respectively). Similar patterns of association were observed for the other smoking variables evaluated. In addition, although statistically non-significant, smoking was more notably positively associated with tumors that exhibit K-ras <b>mutations,</b> especially K-ras <b>transversion</b> <b>mutations,</b> than with tumors without K-ras mutations. An inverse relationship between smoking and the occurrence of APC mutations was suggested, whereas no clear associations were observed with MSI.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The genome is {{constantly}} assaulted by oxidation reactions which {{are likely to}} be associated with oxygen metabolism, and oxidative lesions are generated by many types of oxidants. Such genotoxin-induced alterations in the genomic message have been implicated in aging and in several pathophysiological processes, particularly those associated with cancer. The guanine base (G) in genomic DNA is highly susceptible to oxidative stress due to having the lowest oxidation potential. Therefore, G·C→T·A and G·C→C·G <b>transversion</b> <b>mutations</b> frequently occur under oxidative conditions. One typical lesion of G is 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydro-guanine (8 -oxoG), which can pair with A. This pairing may cause G·C→T·A <b>transversion</b> <b>mutations.</b> Although the number of G·C→C·G transversions is rather high under specific oxidation conditions such as riboflavin photosensitization, the molecular basis of G·C→C·G transversions is not known. Results: To determine which oxidative products are responsible for G·C→C·G <b>transversion</b> <b>mutations,</b> we photooxidized 5 ′-d(AAAAAAGGAAAAAA) / 5 ′-d(TTTTTTCCTTTTTT) using either riboflavin or anthraquinone (AQ) carboxylate under UV irradiation. Prolonged low-temperature (4 °C) enzymatic digestion of photoirradiated sample indicated that under both conditions the amount of 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydro- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine (8 -oxodG) initially increased with decreasing amounts of 2 ′-deoxyguanosine (dG), then decreased with the formation of 2 -amino- 5 -[(2 -deoxy-β-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl) amino]- 4 H-imidazol- 4 -one (dIz), suggesting that nascent 8 -oxoG was further oxidized to 2, 5 -diamino- 4 H-imidazol- 4 -one (Iz) in duplex DNA. Photoirradiation of an AQ-linked oligomer with a complementary strand containing 8 -oxoG indicated that 8 -oxoG residues were oxidized to Iz. These results indicate that Iz is formed from 8 -oxoG through long-range hole migration. Primer extension experiments using a template containing Iz demonstrated that only dGTP is specifically incorporated opposite Iz suggesting that specific Iz·G base pairs are formed. The ‘reverse’ approach consisting of DNA polymerization using dIzTP showed that dIzTP is incorporated opposite G, further confirming the formation of a Iz·G base pair. Conclusions: HPLC product analysis demonstrated that Iz is a key oxidation product of G through 8 -oxoG in DNA photosensitized with riboflavin or anthraquinone. Photoreaction of AQ-linked oligomer confirmed that Iz is formed from 8 -oxoG through long-range hole migration. Two sets of primer extension experiments demonstrated that Iz can specifically pair with G in vitro. Specific Iz·G base pair formation can explain the G·C→C·G <b>transversion</b> <b>mutations</b> that appear under oxidative conditions...|$|R
50|$|When depurination {{occurs with}} DNA, {{it leads to}} the {{formation}} of apurinic site and results in an alteration of the structure. Studies estimate that as many as 5,000 purines are lost this way each day in a typical human cell. In cells, one of the main causes of depurination is the presence of endogenous metabolites undergoing chemical reactions. Apurinic sites in double-stranded DNA are efficiently repaired by portions of the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Depurinated bases in single-stranded DNA undergoing replication can lead to mutations, because in the absence of information from the complementary strand, BER can add an incorrect base at the apurinic site, resulting in either a transition or <b>transversion</b> <b>mutation.</b>|$|E

In contrast, overexpression of MutS did not appreciably reduce lacZ AT → CG <b>transversion</b> <b>mutation</b> in a mutT mutant.

METHODS: Following culture 16 - 23 S PCR ribotyping {{was used to determine}} genomic relationships between A- B+ C. difficile isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using Etests in the presence and absence of the efflux pump inhibitors reserpine (20 microg/mL), L-phenylalanine-L-arginine-beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN; 20 microg/mL) and verapamil (100 microg/mL). Genomic regions including the quinolone-resistance-determining-region (QRDR) of gyrA and gyrB were amplified and characterized. RESULTS: PCR ribotyping profiles identified one major cluster of A- B+ C. difficile, universally resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin; MICs > 32 mg/L). All isolates with high-level resistance had a <b>transversion</b> <b>mutation</b> (A [...] >T) resulting in the amino acid substitution Asp- 426 [...] >Val in gyrB. Non-clonal isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin (MICs 0. 3 and 0. 4 mg/L, respectively) with reduced susceptibility to levofloxacin (MIC 3 mg/L) consistent with the wild-type genotype. The MICs for resistant isolates were not significantly affected by the addition of any of the efflux pump inhibitors. No amino acid substitutions were identified in the QRDR of gyrA.

M 26 is {{a single}} base pair change creating a specific heptanucleotide sequence that is crucial for recombination hotspot activity. This sequence is recognized by proteins that may facilitate rate-limiting steps of recombination at the ade 6 locus. To start the elucidation of the intermediate DNA structures formed during M 26 recombination, we have analyzed the aberrant segregation patterns of two G to C <b>transversion</b> <b>mutations</b> flanking the heptanucleotide sequence in crosses homozygous for M 26. At both sites the level of post-meiotic segregation is typical for G to C <b>transversion</b> <b>mutations</b> in S. pombe in general.

Plasmid-coded Escherichia coli 23 S rRNAs with single mutations at positions 1067 or 1095 were expressed in vivo. Mutant ribosomes are functional in protein synthesis, although those with <b>transversion</b> <b>mutations</b> function less effectively. Antibiotics were bound under conditions where wild-type and mutant ribosomes compete in the same reaction for drug molecules; binding was analysed by allele-specific footprinting. <b>Transversion</b> <b>mutations</b> at 1067 reduce thiostrepton binding more than 1000 -fold. The 1067 G substitution gives a more modest decrease in thiostrepton binding. The changes at 1095 slightly, but significantly, lower the affinity of ribosomes for thiostrepton, again with the G mutation having the smallest effect. Micrococcin binding to ribosomes is reduced to a far greater extent than thiostrepton by all the 1067 and 1095 mutations. Extrapolating these results to growing cells, mutation of nucleotide 1067 A confers resistance towards micrococcin and thiostrepton, while substitutions at 1095 A confer micrococcin resistance, and increase tolerance towards thiostrepton. These data support an rRNA tertiary structure model in which 1067 A and 1095 A lie in close proximity, and are key components in the drug binding site. None of the mutations alters either the higher order rRNA structure or the binding of r-proteins.

The entire exon regions of MLH 1 and MSH 2 genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, screened by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) and analyzed by DNA sequencing to characterize the germline mutations. RESULTS: Three out of 34 tissue samples (8. 8 %) and four out of 34 tissue samples (11. 8 %) showed loss of nuclear staining by immunohistochemistry, indicating the absence of MLH 1 and MSH 2 protein expression in carcinoma cells, respectively. dHPLC analysis followed by DNA sequencing showed these samples to have germline mutations of MSH 2 gene.

The gene IX amber mutants obtained grew well on SuI (Ser) and SuIII (Tyr) suppressing strains but could not be propagated on SuII (Gln) and SuVI (Leu) strains. Complementation studies show that amber mutants in genes V and VII exert a polar effect on gene IX expression suggesting that these three contiguous genes form an operon. In addition, we demonstrate the in vitro synthesis of gene IX-protein in a coupled transcription-translation system...|$|E
40|$|To {{date the}} only point {{mutations}} demonstrated to cause hemophilia are C to T transitions in Taq sites. These were detected by screening Southern blots with cloned factor VIII probes. During {{the development of}} improved methods for detecting and analyzing mutations in genomic DNA, a novel G to C <b>transversion</b> <b>mutation</b> has been identified. This rare transversion results in a missense mutation, with proline being substituted for arginine {{in one of the}} active domains of the factor VIII molecule. The results suggest that the improved methods will be useful for detecting mutations in hemophilia as well as in other genetic disorders. In this method, specific DNA sequences in genomic DNA are amplified using oligonucleotide primers and a heat-resistant DNA polymerase. Mutations are detected and localized in the amplified samples by RNase A cleavage, and the altered region is then sequenced...|$|E
40|$|SummaryWe {{characterized}} the pyruvate carboxylase (PC) gene by PCR amplification, subcloning, and sequencing. The coding region has 19 exons and 18 introns spanning ∼ 16 kb of genomic DNA. Screening both the cDNA and the gene {{of individuals with}} the simple A form of PC deficiency revealed an 1828 G→A missense mutation in 11 Ojibwa and 2 Cree patients and a 2229 G→T <b>transversion</b> <b>mutation</b> in 2 brothers of Micmac origin. Carrier frequency may {{be as high as}} 1 / 10 in some groupings. The two point mutations are located in a region of homology conserved among yeast, rat, and human PC, {{in the vicinity of the}} carboxylation domain of the enzyme. These data provide the first characterization of the human PC gene structure, the identification of common pathogenic mutations, and the demonstration of a founder effect in the Ojibwa and Cree patients...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that dietary factors may differently affect p 53 -dependent and p 53 -independent pathways to colon cancer. Results of such studies may depend on the method used to assess p 53 status. This case-control study of 185 colon-cancer cases and 259 controls examines this relation, using both immunohistochemistry and SSCP(exons 5 - 8) /sequencing to detect p 53 abnormalities. Of 185 carcinomas analyzed using immunohistochemistry, 81 (44 %) were categorized as p 53 over-expression, p 53 mutations were detected in 59 tumors (32 %). A slight increase in risk observed for intake of saturated fat was largely due to an increased risk in cases without p 53 over-expression (OR per 16. 1 g/day, 1. 46; 95 % CI, 1. 08 - 1. 97), and no association in cases with p 53 over-expression (OR, 1. 07, 95 % CI, 0. 78 - 1. 47). However, findings were less pronounced when cases were classified by mutation analysis (wild-type OR, 1. 33; 95 % CI, 1. 01 - 1. 75; mutated OR, 1. 16; 95 % CI, 0. 81 - 1. 65). Similar results were observed for total fat intake. For other nutrients and for vegetable and meat food groups no differences in risk for either p 53 pathway were observed, independent of the laboratory technique used. Interestingly, in cases with <b>transversion</b> <b>mutations</b> in the p 53 gene, an increased risk was observed for saturated fat (OR, 2. 00; 95 % CI, 0. 97 - 4. 14), in contrast to those with mutations at CpG sites (OR, 0. 93; 95 % CI, 0. 55 - 1. 57). An increase in colon-cancer risk for the p 53 -independent pathway due to fat intake, is more pronounced when using immunohistochemistry. However, mutation analysis is needed to study the possible association {{with a small group of}} tumors with <b>transversion</b> <b>mutations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Humans chronically {{infected}} with hepatitis B virus (HBV) are at further risk of liver cancer upon exposure to dietary aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1), a carcinogenic {{product of the}} mold Aspergillus flavus. For the present study, we utilized double-transgenic mice (ATX mice) that express the HBV X protein (HBx) and possess a bacteriophage lambda transgene to evaluate the in vivo effect of HBx expression on AFB 1 -induced DNA mutations. The expression of HBx correlated with a 24 % increase in mutation frequency overall and an approximately twofold increase {{in the incidence of}} G/C-to-T/A <b>transversion</b> <b>mutations</b> following AFB 1 exposure. These results are consistent with a model in which expression of HBx during chronic HBV infection may {{contribute to the development of}} hepatocellular carcinoma following exposure to environmental carcinogens...|$|R
5000|$|The {{mutation}} frequencies for cells {{throughout the}} {{different stages of}} spermatogenesis in mice {{is similar to that}} in female germline cells, that is 5 to 10-fold lower than the mutation frequency in somatic cells [...] Thus low mutation frequency is a feature of germline cells in both sexes. Homologous recombinational repair of double-strand breaks occurs in mouse during sequential stages of spermatogenesis, but is most prominent in spermatocytes. The lower frequencies of mutation in germ cells compared to somatic cells appears to be due to more efficient removal of DNA damages by repair processes including homologous recombination repair during meiosis. Mutation frequency during spermatogenesis increases with age. [...] The mutations in spermatogenic cells of old mice include an increased prevalence of <b>transversion</b> <b>mutations</b> compared to young and middle-aged mice.|$|R
