5|$|Vehicle {{occupants}} {{who wear}} seat belts {{have a lower}} incidence of TBI after a motor vehicle accident. However, if <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> is situated {{across the front of}} the neck (instead of the chest), this increases the risk of tracheal injury. Design of medical instruments can be modified to prevent iatrogenic TBI, and medical practitioners can use techniques that reduce the risk of injury with procedures such as tracheotomy.|$|E
5|$|Crest badges {{consist of}} a crest and a motto/slogan. These {{elements}} are heraldic property and protected by law in Scotland. Crest badges may be worn by anyone; however, {{those who are not}} entitled to the heraldic elements within, wear a crest badge surrounded by a strap and buckle. Those who own the heraldic elements within, may wear a crest badge surrounded by a plain circlet. <b>The</b> <b>strap</b> and buckle represents that the wearer is a follower of the individual who owns the crest and motto.|$|E
5|$|In Murray, Virginia, the Holvey family {{visits a}} local {{amusement}} park. When the youngest child, Teddy, lets his balloon fly away, his father, Steve, {{gives him the}} balloon that belongs to his older brother, Charlie (Joel Palmer). When the boys' mother, Maggie (Helene Clarkson), is in the bathroom, <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> in Teddy's stroller comes undone. Teddy follows the balloon floating under its own power out of the restroom and onto the tracks of the park's tour train, leading to him getting killed by the train. Charlie is {{the only member of}} the Holvey family not to grieve Teddy's death at the scene.|$|E
50|$|The primary design {{difference}} from traditional huaraches is in <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> that cover <b>the</b> {{front of the}} foot. In traditional sandals <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> are woven in an intricate design. In the variant used for running <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> are much simpler and less ornate.|$|R
50|$|To prevent <b>the</b> helmet <b>straps</b> from {{impairing}} <b>the</b> drivers vision, {{there is}} a design where <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> are held horizontal to prevent <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> from sagging. There are also designs in which no apparatus is needed to keep <b>straps</b> out of <b>the</b> drivers sight. Helmet straps {{are made up of}} shock absorbing material used while climbing or for security when working at high elevations. <b>The</b> <b>straps</b> include a woven nylon that requires up to 475 lbs. of force to cause <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> to tear. Straps that are stretchable allow the drivers brain to slow down to avoid brain damage caused from the brain slamming into the skull; but <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> do not let the head move too far forward to cause neck injuries.|$|R
50|$|Triangular {{shape on}} Ring {{can be found}} on the petite size {{intimate}} garment while the wearer has narrow shoulder. <b>The</b> <b>straps</b> can line inner the shoulders and avoid <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> slide off from shoulder. More application on the Triangular Ring is on the Racer Back Bras for joining <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> to underband.|$|R
5|$|Poison {{was given}} a {{secondary}} outfit for Capcom Fighting All-Stars alongside her primary classic attire. Made of shiny, silvery material it consisted of boots that extended halfway up her thighs and a combined sleeveless shirt/short skirt with a plunging neckline. Gloves and a small hairband were also added, {{as well as a}} belt, with the handcuffs hanging off of it. Her arm straps were removed, though <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> around her neck remained.|$|E
5|$|At the prom, Artie and Marge are voted prom {{king and}} queen, {{and the two}} share the first dance. Meanwhile, Homer, heartbroken, leaves and cries in the hallway. After the prom, Artie tries to get romantic with Marge in the {{backseat}} of his car: after he pushes his luck too far, she slaps him and demands to be taken home. Meanwhile, Homer's limousine time has run out, and without any money, he decides to walk home. Along the way Marge and Artie pass by Homer. After Artie drops Marge off at her house, she returns in her car to pick up Homer, realizing that he was the man for her all along. Homer manages to fix up <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> of Marge's dress with the corsage that he got her after Artie ruined it from his earlier attempt.|$|E
5|$|Clan chiefs may {{wear their}} crest simpliciter, that is without being encircled by the motto {{and without any}} feathers. It is more common, however, for a clan chiefs to wear their own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their motto or slogan (pictured left). The chief's crest badge does not contain <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> and buckle that other clan members are permitted to wear. Clan chiefs are also entitled to wear three eagle feathers behind the circlet of their crest badge. On certain occasions, such as clan gatherings, it may be appropriate to use real eagle feathers. Clan chiefs that {{are members of the}} British Peerage or a feudal baron are entitled to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge, though {{this is a matter of}} personal preference.|$|E
50|$|They may {{be fitted}} with D-ring {{attachments}} or buckles to which nylon webbing, chain or another restraining strap may be attached. <b>The</b> <b>straps</b> {{may have a}} loop mechanism to allow the tightening of <b>the</b> <b>straps.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Midwinter turned {{aside to}} buckle <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> of his knapsack. [...] "Give me another chance of hearing Miss Gwilt when I come back," [...] he said, {{with his head}} down, and his fingers busy at <b>the</b> <b>straps.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} a design of an inflatable module including a rigid member disposed in a restraint layer, wherein the restraint layer includes orthogonal straps, includes modeling a <b>strap</b> adjacent to <b>the</b> rigid member and a <b>strap</b> connected to <b>the</b> rigid member. <b>The</b> adjacent <b>strap</b> and <b>the</b> member <b>strap</b> extend {{in a first}} direction. The method further includes selecting a first length of <b>the</b> member <b>strap</b> such that <b>the</b> adjacent <b>strap</b> carries load before <b>the</b> member <b>strap</b> during pressurization of the inflatable module, modeling tensions in <b>the</b> member <b>strap</b> with <b>the</b> first length and <b>the</b> adjacent <b>strap</b> during pressurization of the inflatable model, and outputting the modeled tensions in <b>the</b> member <b>strap</b> with <b>the</b> first length and <b>the</b> adjacent <b>strap.</b> An inflatable module includes a member strap having a length such that an adjacent strap carries load before <b>the</b> member <b>strap</b> during pressurization of the inflatable module...|$|R
5|$|Due to city regulations, the Master and Mistress {{are forced}} to muzzle Lad when they take him from the show. During the drive out of the city, Lad falls {{out of the car}} and is left behind. After he realizes he is lost, Lad starts towards home. Along the way he is chased by the police and a crowd of people, who presume he is rabid, but he escapes them by {{swimming}} across the Hudson River. Later he is attacked by a mongrel guard dog, but he refuses to run from the battle. He initially struggles to defend himself while muzzled, but then the other dog inadvertently bites through <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> holding the muzzle on, allowing Lad to quickly defeat him. When the Master and Mistress return from searching for Lad, they find him waiting on the porch.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E
5|$|Bayside: The dark, bearded Peter Fisk {{walks along}} the wooded paths {{of the island}} until {{reaching}} a beach. He strips and sunbathes on a blanket. Suddenly, out in the water, the blond naked Donovan appears and runs up onto the beach to Fisk. Fisk performs oral sex on Donovan, who then leads Fisk into the woods. Fisk grabs the blanket and follows, catching up to Donovan in a clearing. They kiss and touch each other, then Donovan takes a studded leather strap from Fisk's wrist and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, momentary flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's wrist. Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance. Donovan dons Fisk's abandoned clothes and heads off down the beach.|$|E

5000|$|Led by singer-songwriter Kirk Brandon (formerly of the Pack), the {{original}} group also consisted of guitarist Steve Guthrie, bassist Stan Stammers (formerly of <b>the</b> <b>Straps</b> and <b>the</b> Epileptics), saxophonist John [...] "Boy" [...] Lennard and drummer Luke Rendle (formerly of Crisis and <b>the</b> <b>Straps).</b>|$|R
50|$|Rings {{are usually}} found on <b>the</b> {{shoulder}} <b>straps,</b> where they {{function as a}} joint. For intimate apparel, the requirement of front strap can be different from back <b>strap.</b> <b>The</b> front <b>strap</b> is more decorative and stretchability {{is less of a}} concern while <b>the</b> back <b>strap</b> is required to have better stability when stretched. Therefore, <b>the</b> two different <b>straps</b> (front and back) and the ring found on intimate apparel are important to join the functions of <b>the</b> bra <b>strap</b> together.|$|R
5|$|The arm-tefillin is laid on {{the inner}} side of the bare left arm, right arm if one is left handed, two finger breadths above the elbow, so that when the arm is bent the tefillin faces towards the heart. The arm-tefillin is {{tightened}} with the thumb, the blessing is said, and <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> is immediately wrapped around the upper arm in the opposite direction it came from {{in order to keep the}} knot tight without having to hold it. Some wrap it around the upper arm for less than a full revolution (the bare minimum to keep the knot tight) and then wrap it around the forearm seven times, while others wrap it around the upper arm an additional time before wrapping it around the forearm. Many Ashkenazim wear the knot to be tightened (not to be confused with the knot on the base which is permanently tied and always worn on the inside, facing the heart) on the inside and wrap inward, while Nusach Sephard Ashkenazim and all Sephardim wear it on the outside and wrap outward.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>strap</b> can be {{adjusted}} to suit the diver's head. Too loose may not provide an effective seal and the mask may dislodge easily, and too tight may result in discomfort or pain. Correct positioning of <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> {{around the back of}} the head will reduce the risk of dislodging and facilitate clearing.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{maintenance}} is to rinse {{inside and out}} with clean, fresh water after each day's use, and allow to dry out of direct sunlight before storage. Ultraviolet light degrades the synthetic materials of the skirt and frame. A well-maintained mask should last for several years. <b>The</b> <b>strap</b> is the most stressed component and is often the first part to fail, but can usually be replaced. Inspection of <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> for cracks and tears before use can {{reduce the risk of}} failure during a dive.|$|E
50|$|When using Aylmeri jesses, {{there are}} usually two sets of straps: <b>the</b> mews <b>straps,</b> for manning and {{tethering}} the bird, and flying <b>straps.</b> <b>The</b> flying <b>straps</b> are lighter and smaller for hunting; <b>the</b> mews <b>straps</b> are heavy {{and less likely to}} break with stress.|$|R

50|$|Suspenders, Individual Equipment Belt - The {{individual}} equipment belt suspenders are Y shaped with three adjusting straps, but four points of {{attachment to the}} {{individual equipment}} belt and small arms ammunition cases. <b>The</b> shoulder <b>straps</b> are padded with spacer cloth. Each shoulder strap has a web loop and a non-slip buckle on each of <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> in <b>the</b> front and one at the back through which <b>the</b> adjusting <b>straps</b> pass. There are rectangular wire loops located between the web loops and the buckles {{on the front of}} <b>the</b> <b>straps.</b> <b>The</b> 1 in wide adjusting straps have side-retaining snap hooks at one end. <b>The</b> back adjusting <b>strap</b> has an inverted V of which each end has a side-retaining snaphook. Each of <b>the</b> adjusting <b>straps</b> has a loop around it made of 1 in elastic material. In 1991, the individual equipment belt suspenders are redesignated LC-2 with no apparent modifications.|$|R
25|$|The {{methods of}} {{clearing}} differ between the half mask, which covers {{the eyes and}} nose, and the full-face mask, which also covers the mouth. If the mask has a purge valve and <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> tension is correct, the diver holds the head so that the valve is at the lowest point and exhales through the nose. If the mask is a good fit on the diver's face and <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> is correctly placed, exhaling through the nose will usually drive water out along the bottom edge of the skirt. It {{may be necessary to}} press {{the upper part of the}} mask against the face to improve the seal if the diver is rolled to one side. If the fit is not perfect, or <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> is too low, contact pressure of the top edge against the forehead may be insufficient to maintain a seal when the head is upright.|$|E
25|$|The south doorway, {{which is}} 13th-century, Early English, {{has lost its}} {{original}} character, being now square-headed. This door and the north door inside the church are the most interesting in the district because of <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> ironwork on both.|$|E
