40|$|The {{misalignment}} {{causes the}} greatest {{damage to the}} conveyor belt. As {{a result of the}} interaction of the moving belt with the stationary parts of the conveyor, the sides of <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> <b>wear</b> intensively. This results in reducing the life of the belt. The reasons for this phenomenon are well investigated, but the difficulty {{lies in the fact that}} they all act simultaneously. The belt misalignment prevention can be carried out in two ways: by minimizing the effect of causes and by aligning the belt. The construction of aligning devices and errors encountered in practice are considered in this paper. Self-aligning roller supports rotational in plan view are recommended as a means of combating the belt misalignment...|$|E

5000|$|Belt (Greek: Ζώνη, Zone; Slavonic: Poyas): <b>The</b> <b>belt</b> <b>worn</b> by Orthodox {{monks and}} nuns is {{normally}} leather, though {{sometimes it is}} of cloth.

25|$|In Ancient Greece the simple, sleeved T-shaped tunics were {{constructed}} of three seamed tubes of cloth, {{a style that}} originated in the Semitic Near East, along with the Semitic-based word khiton, {{also referred to as}} a chiton. <b>The</b> <b>belted</b> <b>worn</b> linen chiton was the primary garment for men and women.|$|R
50|$|On {{reaching}} basecamp, {{the teams}} are given time to recover during which an assessment team read through the expedition logs and projects. They also examine whether the minimum distance of 200 km has been completed. Following the assessment phase, Rover Scouts deemed to have met {{the conditions of the}} award are presented with <b>the</b> Explorer <b>Belt</b> at a ceremony held {{at the end of the}} expedition.

The piece added to <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> can never be of a lower or the same colour as <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> <b>worn</b> by <b>the</b> judoka, so an orange belt can’t have a yellow piece, but it can have green, blue or, brown.|$|R

50|$|The word Bora was {{originally}} {{taken from the}} Gamilaraay language spoken by the Kamilaroi {{people who lived in}} the region north of the Hunter Valley in New South Wales to southern Queensland. It was then adorted broadly to describe similar ritual sites and the ceremonies associated with them performed throughout Eastern Australia. Many other terms exist across Australia to denote similar initiatory rites on a ceremonial ground, such as burbung (Wiradjuri), and kuringal (Yuin). The specific word is said to come from <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> <b>worn</b> by initiated men.|$|R

5000|$|A {{letter written}} by Ivan Baillie in 1768 and {{published}} in the Edinburgh Magazine in March 1785 states that the garment people would recognize as a kilt today was invented in the 1720s by Thomas Rawlinson, a Quaker from Lancashire. After the Jacobite campaign of 1715 the government opened the Highlands to outside exploitation, and Rawlinson went into partnership with Ian MacDonnell, chief of the MacDonnells of Glengarry to manufacture charcoal from the forests near Inverness and smelt iron ore there. <b>The</b> <b>belted</b> plaid <b>worn</b> by <b>the</b> Highlanders he employed was too [...] "cumbrous and unwieldy" [...] for this work, so, together with the tailor of the regiment stationed at Inverness, Rawlinson produced a kilt which consisted of {{the lower half of}} <b>the</b> <b>belted</b> plaid <b>worn</b> as a [...] "distinct garment with pleats already sewn". He wore it himself, as did his business partner, whose clansmen then followed suit.|$|R

There have been reports of Hamas operatives planning and preparing attacks incorporating chemicals. In one case, nails and bolts packed into explosives detonated by a Hamas suicide bomber in a December 2001 attack at the Ben-Yehuda street in Jerusalem were soaked in rat poison.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{approximation}} on the postural sway of healthy subjects <b>wearing</b> a weighted <b>belt</b> around their pelvis was measured. Twenty subjects {{between the ages}} of 23 and 30 years stood on a polyurethane foam platform that amplified their postural sway and were filmed from a lateral view. All subjects wore markers over their mandibles, hips, and knees and were filmed three times with <b>the</b> weighted <b>belt</b> <b>worn</b> on a randomly selected trial. Frames from a 10 -second interval of film from each trial were studied, and the summed displacement at each bony landmark between each frame of film was calculated. A significant decrease in displacement at the mandible (p <. 02) was found when <b>the</b> weighted <b>belt</b> was <b>worn.</b> <b>The</b> decrease in displacement was not significant at the hip or knee.

50|$|For the Hydristor. a 'concentric nesting {{of endless}} metal belts' replaces the fixed {{elliptic}} cam ring. And, all the vane tipscontact the inner surface of <b>the</b> <b>belt.</b> <b>The</b> historical friction of the vane tips now causes <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> set to rotate at approximately thesame speed as the rotor and vanes, {{but there is}} a very slight 'walking behind' of the vane contact area and there is a very slight speed slippage which results in <b>the</b> inner <b>belt</b> <b>wear</b> being spread out and this results in much longer <b>belt</b> life. Also, <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> set now confines the pressure and speed-squared forces like a pressure vessel and the potential speed of operation is very much higher. The result of all this is to raise both the operating pressure and the operating speed and this amounts to a 10 times increase in hydraulic packaging density and similar decrease in weight per unit power.|$|R
