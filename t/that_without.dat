5|$|Bogin {{observes that}} Thompson {{originated}} {{the use of}} transformational grids to measure growth in two dimensions, but <b>that</b> <b>without</b> modern computers the method was tedious to apply and was not often used.

5|$|By {{the time}} of its cancellation, Thunderbirds had become widely popular in the UK and was being {{distributed}} extensively overseas. Grade, however, believed <b>that</b> <b>without</b> the financial boost of an American network sale, a full second series would fail to recover its production costs. He therefore asked Anderson to devise a new concept that he hoped would stand a greater chance of winning over the profitable US market. This became Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons.|$|E
5|$|During Frank's {{election}} campaign, Claire {{begins to}} question whether she still loves him. In the season finale, she and Frank get into an ugly fight in which she {{says he is not}} enough for her; Frank replies <b>that</b> <b>without</b> him, she is nothing. Season three ends with Claire leaving Frank as he prepares to go to the New Hampshire primary.|$|E

5|$|For {{the series}} of Bond novels, Fleming {{realised}} <b>that</b> <b>without</b> threatening villains Bond seemed less heroic: this tradition of strong literary villain was brought across to the screen in the Eon series. The third Bond film, Goldfinger, set a pattern for having a main villain with a loyal and dangerous henchman, a model which was followed in subsequent films.|$|E
5|$|In June 1873, Lee left Dublin for London {{and never}} returned. A {{fortnight}} later, Bessie followed him; {{the two girls}} joined her.

5|$|The Moon {{may have}} {{dramatically}} affected {{the development of}} life by moderating the planet's climate. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon. Some theorists think <b>that</b> <b>without</b> this stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as {{appears to be the}} case for Mars.|$|E

5|$|After the {{founding}} of Night School Studio, the team set up a casting call for voice actors on Backstage. Prior to actors being cast and their lines recorded, the team had placeholder subtitles in the game. Lead engineer Bryant Cannon recalled <b>that</b> <b>without</b> the voices, he was unsure whether the game {{would be fun to}} play; after the voices were added, he could see the characters as believable people having conversations. Hines directed recording sessions, allowing him to change dialogue on-the-fly if he felt material did not work when voiced by the actors. All of the actors voiced their lines separately, with their conversations in-game stitched together in post-production.|$|E

5|$|An {{attempt was}} made to provide the {{completed}} Arrows to the National Research Council of Canada as high-speed test aircraft. The NRC refused, noting <b>that</b> <b>without</b> sufficient spare parts and maintenance, as well as qualified pilots, the NRC could make no use of them. A similar project initiated by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (Boscombe Down) had resulted in Avro vice-president (engineering) Jim Floyd's preparing a transatlantic ferry operation. This proposal, like others from the United States, was never realized.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason is}} the {{protection}} of star players. Fighting within the game can also {{send a message to}} players and coaches from other teams that cheap shots, dirty plays, and targeting specific players will not be tolerated and there will be consequences involved. Fighting can provide retribution for a team's player getting targeted or injured. Overall, fighting is known to be a beneficial policing that the game needs to keep players in line. Over the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Gretzky, who was protected by Dave Semenko, Marty McSorley, and others, and Brett Hull, who was protected by Kelly Chase and others. Many believe <b>that</b> <b>without</b> players protecting each other, referees would affect the game play by having to call more penalties, and the league would have to suspend players for longer periods.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the gods}} and goddesses meet and hold a thing to discuss and debate the matter. At the thing, the god Heimdallr puts forth the {{suggestion}} that, in place of Freyja, Thor should be dressed as the bride, complete with jewels, women's clothing down to his knees, a bridal head-dress, and the necklace Brísingamen. Thor rejects the idea, yet Loki interjects {{that this will be}} the only way to get back Mjöllnir. Loki points out <b>that,</b> <b>without</b> Mjöllnir, the jötnar will be able to invade and settle in Asgard. The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to Jötunheimr together.|$|E

5|$|As {{introduced}} in Soulcalibur II, Necrid is a warrior who fought and defeated a former wielder of the cursed sword Soul Edge, and was {{pulled into the}} dimension where the sword's spirit, Inferno, inhabited. Instead of battling Inferno, he fled, and became trapped in the dimension for years. Warped physically and mentally by the dimension as a result, he escaped during the closing events of Soulcalibur, but quickly found <b>that,</b> <b>without</b> the dimension's energies, he experienced intense pain and would eventually die. Attacking travelers he perceived as enemies, he happened upon a fragment of Soul Edge and felt his pain dampened. Pursuing other fragments of the sword, he encountered Talim, who was also seeking them, and helped defeat the resurrected Inferno. His memories and sanity restored by the battle, Necrid closed {{the entrance to the}} void, trapping himself within.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the release}} of Ace, Cascade Games was infamous for their Cassette 50 (1983) game {{compilation}} that featured simplistic and subpar games. Stevens points out <b>that</b> <b>without</b> the income from the compilation, the project {{would not have been}} possible. The developers estimate the production cost of Ace at £40k. Following {{the release of}} Ace, Cascade moved into mainstream AAA game development. Wilhelmy says that Cascade boasted over a million GBP in turnover over the following years. The company produced two sequels, Ace 2 (1987) and ACE 2088 (1989), and various other games before closing down in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Decline in age, size during sexual {{maturity}} in {{great northern tilefish}} population is occurring throughout the continental shelf. In the mid-Atlantic Bight, smaller sizes and younger ages at maturity were observed in 2008, compared to the survey data from the 1980s where recorded measurements showed a larger population. The recent estimates of age and size at maturity in the southern U.S. waters were smaller than those previously reported in the late 1980s. There were also very few juvenile tilefish seen in tilefish population surveys in the southern U.S. waters in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Declines in population could negatively affect other organisms in their surrounding environment {{due to the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>without</b> tilefish, the burrows underneath the continental shelf will disappear, therefore putting an end to the symbiotic relationship with other organisms that use the tunnels as shelter.|$|E

5|$|Downes was {{chairman}} of the Masseurs' Registration Board, a councillor of the Victorian division of the Australian Red Cross, and chairman of the Red Cross National Council. He was Victorian State Commissioner of the St. John Ambulance Brigade for 25 years. He was also president of the St John Ambulance Association for eight years, and chairman of the Victorian Civil Ambulance Service from 1937 to 1938. In 1930, he was appointed a Commander of the Venerable Order of Saint John, and later became a Knight of Grace of the order in 1937. At the same time, Doris became an Officer of the Order of Saint John, in recognition for her fund raising efforts for the Victorian branch. She also later served as a member of its council from 1942 to 1953. Downes was instrumental in persuading the various state branches to come together as a national organisation, arguing <b>that</b> <b>without</b> a national body, the organisation would be eclipsed by the Red Cross.|$|E

In the farthest western parts of the territory, there are younger sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Research on the thickness of the ice has revealed <b>that</b> <b>without</b> the ice, the coast would be similar to those of Norway and Greenland, with deep fjords and islands.|$|E
