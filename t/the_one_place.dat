5|$|In the Rogue Cut version, Rogue's role is more consequential, and the {{narrative}} is more complex: When seeing Stryker causes Wolverine's consciousness to phase {{between past and}} future—resulting in his claws being extended, injuring Kitty Pryde—the Professor talks {{about the need for}} Wolverine to have more time back in 1973. Bobby Drake (Iceman) proposes breaking into the heavily guarded remains of Cerebro at the Professor's school, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> where the Professor's mind can't reach others from the outside, in order to rescue Rogue, who is being held captive there. With the Professor and Magneto, he does so—at the cost of his own life—and Rogue is taken to where the mutants are making their last stand, where she takes over for Kitty in regards to keeping Wolverine's mind in 1973, for the remaining time until the moment history is changed, with a suggestion that Wolverine is aware of the switch as he appears to feel Rogue's presence. The Sentinels were able to find the X-Men through a tracking device inside a Sentinel's hand, which got stuck in the X-Jet after the Sentinel tried to prevent the Professor, Magneto and Rogue from escaping the incinerated remains of the X-Mansion. It also includes a scene where Mystique visits the X-Mansion at night while Charles and Logan are sleeping. She revisits her previous romance with Beast but leaves very early the next morning and breaks Cerebro in order to prevent Charles from finding her.|$|E

500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was {{critical}} of Emma in the show's second season. He said: [...] "Emma is apparently married, but we haven’t seen her husband since October, and {{even when he was}} more of a “fixture” on the show (which is difficult to say about a character who’s appeared as little as Carl Howell has), his relationship with Emma made no sense as anything other than a plot device. Now, as it turns out, Emma and Carl haven’t consummated their marriage at all, and this {{has something to do with}} the fact that the show has combined Emma’s germ-phobia and virginity into some sort of terrifying psychosexual pathology that doesn’t make much sense and doesn’t resemble the somewhat levelheaded person she used to be. (The plotting in Will Schuester’s love life is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> where the show attempts to have even a modicum of continuity, for whatever reason.) Anyway, Carl is necessarily upset about this, and he’s also upset when Holly Holliday gets Emma to admit that she still has confusing feelings for Will, so he resolves to let her stay in the condo while he stays in the Radisson where all of the good big-name Glee guest stars go to hope their pilots for the fall are picked up." ...|$|E

2500|$|All in all, Hemmings was {{probably}} the second best off spinner in England from around 1982–1991 and was largely unfortunate that his best years coincided with John Emburey's. [...] There were other contenders for <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> in the England team {{during the same time}} such as Geoff Miller, Vic Marks and Pat Pocock. [...] However broadly speaking England selectors preferred their off spinners to be able to bat which explains why Geoff Miller was often selected. [...] Hemmings was a useful batsman, twice frustrating the Australian test attack of 1989 at Trent Bridge {{to such an extent that}} there was a small on field altercation with Australian fast bowler Geoff Lawson just before tea on day 4 of that match – Hemmings having hit Lawson for several fours in a completely lost cause – the game was well and truly lost by this point.|$|E

2500|$|In 1886, Van Gogh {{left the}} Netherlands and {{traveled}} to Paris to explore emerging artistic movements {{under the guidance}} and continued support of his brother Theo van Gogh, an art dealer. Surprised that Vincent had come to Paris unannounced, and in opposition to their conversations about timing of his arrival, Vincent stayed in Theo's apartment on Rue Laval until a larger apartment could be acquired. For four months, Van Gogh studied with Fernand Cormon, painting plaster casts, live nude models and props available at Cormon's studio. [...] Cormon also encouraged open-air painting. [...] There me met Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Émile Bernard, and Louis Anquetin. Through Theo and artistic social circles he also met Edgar Degas, Camille Pissarro, Paul Signac, Georges Seurat, and Paul Gauguin. [...] Through the fellowship with these men, he was introduced to Impressionists, Symbolists, Pointillists, and Japanese art, Ukiyo-e, and woodcut prints. In spite of his unusual manner, disheveled clothes and often time frightening manner, Paris was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> where Van Gogh developed friendships with other artists. [...] So much so that when Toulouse-Lautrec heard disparaging remarks against Van Gogh, he challenged the man to a duel. Seeing and trading artwork with the Parisian avant-garde artists, Van Gogh understood what Theo {{had been trying to}} tell him for years about modern art. He was able to experiment with each of the movements to develop his own style, becoming what some say is [...] "one of the most important artists in modern art." ...|$|E

2500|$|Efforts {{to survey}} a new, shorter, [...] "better" [...] route {{had been under}} way since 1864.

From North Platte, Nebraska (elevation [...] ), the railroad proceeded westward and upward along a new path across the Nebraska Territory and Wyoming Territory (then part of the Dakota Territory) along the north bank of the South Platte River and into what would become the state of Wyoming at Lone Pine, Wyoming.

2500|$|One notable {{unfavorable}} opinion {{appeared in}} the Daily Mail. In the piece, the plot of The Fault in Our Stars was described as [...] "mawkish at best, exploitative at worst" [...] and the book was characterized as belonging to the [...] "sick-lit" [...] young adult genre, together with other young-adult novels such as Never Eighteen and Before I Die. This entire genre, {{as well as the}} genre of young-adult novels dealing with suicide and self-harm (the piece mentions Thirteen Reasons Why, By the Time You Read This, I'll Be Dead, [...] The Lovely Bones, and Red Tears) was criticized as being [...] "distasteful" [...] and inappropriate for their target audience of teens. The Guardian criticized the piece, pointing out in particular that The Fault in Our Stars was chosen by The Guardian as that month's [...] "teen book club choice" [...] because [...] "it's a gripping read, featuring two compelling characters, that deals sensitively and even humorously with a difficult situation without descending into mawkishness." [...] In general, The Guardian faulted the Daily Mail for suggesting that the issues of illness, depression, and sexuality are inappropriate precisely [...] "in <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> where difficult subjects have traditionally been most sensitively explored for teens: fiction written specifically for them." [...] For his part, in an interview for The Guardian, John Green said: [...] "The thing that bothered me about The Daily Mail piece was that it was a bit condescending to teenagers.
