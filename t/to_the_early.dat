5|$|The Foundation Stone of the Monument <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Early</b> Founders of Singapore, {{usually called}} the Early Founders Memorial Stone is a {{national}} memorial that is dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> founders ("Unknown Immigrants") of Singapore. The original idea was raised by a graduates' association and an open design competition was held for the memorial project. The foundation stone was initially erected along Collyer Quay Street outside the Fullerton Hotel in 1970. After a series of setbacks and delays, the project was finally scrapped after no worthy design was accepted, which resulted the foundation stone becoming the memorial afterwards. In 2000, the memorial was relocated to the National Archives of Singapore at Canning Rise before moving back to the grounds of The Fullerton Hotel in 2010.|$|E

5|$|A Roman road {{passed through}} Oakhanger {{although}} no traces of it remain today. The first {{mention of the}} village came from a charter dating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 10th century, and the lands of Oakhanger were passed on by numerous families up until the early 20th century. The village contains four Grade II listed buildings, including Oakhanger Farmhouse and its three outbuildings. Oakhanger also has one pub, The Red Lion. St Mary Magdalene's Church was built in 1873 and the former Royal Air Force station, RAF Oakhanger, still retains its space domes in the village, although the station is now privately run.|$|E

Hair sheep are similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. Some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the Dorper, result from crosses between wool and hair breeds. For meat and hide producers, hair sheep are cheaper to keep, as {{they do not need}} shearing. Hair sheep are also more {{resistant}} to parasites and hot weather.|$|E
5|$|After the British {{settlement}} at Sydney Cove {{was established}} in 1788, {{a significant part of}} the Chinese porcelain shipped to Australia came via British traders living in India.

Examination of the cargo of ships wrecked during the early colonisation of Australia show that the Country Trade played an important role in getting supplies, including Chinese porcelain traded via India often in Indian-built vessels, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> Australian colonies.|$|E
