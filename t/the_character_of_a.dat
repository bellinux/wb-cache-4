40|$|A {{short and}} simple {{derivation}} of the formula of Frobenius, {{which gives the}} dimensions of the irreducible representations of Sn, the symmetric group on any number, n, of symbols, is given. These dimensions are <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> identity element of the group, i. e., of the element all of whose cycles are unary. It is shown how <b>a</b> slight modification <b>of</b> Frobenius' formula yields, when n = 2 p is even, <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> element <b>of</b> Sn all of whose cycles are binary and, when n = 3 p is <b>a</b> multiple <b>of</b> 3, <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> element <b>of</b> Sn all of whose cycles are ternary and, generally, when n = kp is <b>a</b> multiple <b>of</b> any positive integer k, <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> element <b>of</b> Sn all of whose cycles are of length k. It is noteworthy that the calculations become simpler, rather than more complicated, as k increases. Finally, this paper shows how to derive from Frobenius' formula <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> element <b>of</b> Sn which has at least one unary cycle and, from the present modifications <b>of</b> Frobenius' formula, <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> element <b>of</b> Sn which has at least one cycle of length k, k = 2, 3, [...] ., n...|$|R

5|$|First {{movement}} in moderate or fast tempo, and in sonata form. The exposition {{consists of two}} or three thematic and tonal areas and, as common in the Classical style, moves from tonic to dominant (in major mode works) or to the relative major (in minor mode works). However, as often with Schubert, the harmonic scheme of the exposition involves additional, intermediate tonalities, which may be quite remote from the tonic-dominant axis, and sometimes imbue certain expository passages with <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> development section. The main themes of the exposition are often in ternary form, with their middle section digressing to a different tonality. The themes generally do not form symmetrical periods, and irregular phrase lengths are prominent. The exposition ends with a repeat sign. The development section opens with an abrupt turn into a new tonal area. A new theme, based on a melodic fragment from the second thematic group of the exposition, is presented in this section over recurrent rhythmic figuration, and then developed, undergoing successive transformations. The first thematic group returns in the recapitulation with different or additional harmonic digressions; the second group returns unaltered, only transposed a fourth up. The short coda maintains the tonic key and mainly soft dynamics, achieving a resolution of the movement's conflicts and ending pianissimo.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{accession}} of Heraclius, the Sassanid advance pushed {{deep into}} the Levant, occupying Damascus and Jerusalem and removing the True Cross to Ctesiphon. The counter-attack launched by Heraclius took on <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> holy war, and an acheiropoietos image of Christ was carried as a military standard (similarly, when Constantinople was saved from a combined Avar–Sassanid–Slavic siege in 626, the victory was attributed to the icons of the Virgin that were led in procession by Patriarch Sergius about {{the walls of the}} city). In this very siege of Constantinople of the year 626, amidst the climactic Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, the combined Avar, Sassanid, and Slavic forces unsuccessfully besieged the Byzantine capital between June and July. After this, the Sassanid army was forced to withdraw to Anatolia. The loss came just after news had reached them of yet another Byzantine victory, where Heraclius's brother Theodore scored well against the Persian general Shahin. Following this, Heraclius led an invasion into Sassanid Mesopotamia once again.|$|E
5|$|In early 1594, the Serbs in Banat rose {{up against}} the Ottomans. The rebels had, in <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> holy war, carried war flags with the icon of Saint Sava. The war banners were consecrated by Patriarch Jovan Kantul, and the {{uprising}} was aided by Serbian Orthodox metropolitans Rufim Njeguš of Cetinje and Visarion of Trebinje (s. 1590–1602). In response, Ottoman Grand Vizier Koca Sinan Pasha demanded that the green flag of the Prophet Muhammed be brought from Damascus to counter the Serb flag and ordered that the sarcophagus containing the relics of Saint Sava {{be removed from the}} Mileševa monastery and transferred to Belgrade via military convoy. Along the way, the Ottoman convoy killed all the people in its path as a warning to the rebels. The Ottomans publicly incinerated the relics of Saint Sava on a pyre atop the Vračar plateau on April 27, 1595, and had the ashes scattered.|$|E

During the 1930s, the laying of badnjak on the fire became a court ritual.

At the end of the 1930s in some parts of Yugoslavia, especially Vojvodina and Montenegro, the military badnjak ceremony was performed not in the barracks yard but in a square in the garrison town. An open fire was built, on which the badnjak was placed by an Orthodox priest in the presence of soldiers and citizens. This tradition, symbolizing the unity of state, church, and people, was ended by the outbreak of WorldWarII.|$|E
5|$|The 1905 the Florida Legislature {{passed the}} Buckman Act, which reorganized the Florida college system into {{a school for}} white males (University of the State of Florida), a school for white females (Florida Female College later changed to Florida State College for Women), and a school for African Americans (State Normal and Industrial College for Colored Students). The Buckman Act was controversial, as it changed <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{historic}} coeducational state school into a school for women. An early and major benefactor of the school, James Westcott III (1839–1887), willed substantial monies to the school to support continued operations. In 1911 his estate sued the state educational board contending the estate {{was not intended to}} support a single-sex school. The Florida Supreme Court decided the issue in favor of the State of Florida stating the change in character (existing from 1905 to 1947) was within the intent of the Westcott will. By 1933 the Florida State College for Women had grown to be the third largest women's college in the United States and was the first state women's college in the South to be awarded a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, as well as the first university in Florida so honored. Florida State was the largest of the original two universities in Florida, even during the period as the college for women until 1919.|$|E
5|$|The film {{operates}} on multiple dramatic and narrative levels. It employs {{some of the}} conventions of film noir, among them <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> femme fatale; narration by the protagonist (in the original release); chiaroscuro cinematography; and giving the hero a questionable moral outlook—extended to include reflections upon {{the nature of his}} own humanity. It is a literate science fiction film, thematically enfolding the philosophy of religion and moral implications of human mastery of genetic engineering in the context of classical Greek drama and hubris. It also draws on Biblical images, such as Noah's flood, and literary sources, such as Frankenstein. Linguistically, the theme of mortality is subtly reiterated in the chess game between Sebastian and Tyrell, supposedly based on the famous Immortal Game of 1851 (though Scott has said this was merely coincidental).|$|E

5|$|But {{although}} the Sermons of Swift are deficient in eloquence, and were lightly esteemed by their author, {{they must not}} be undervalued by the modern reader. They exhibit, in an eminent degree, that powerful grasp of intellect which distinguished the author above all his contemporaries. In no religious discourses can be found more sound good sense, more happy and forcible views of the immediate subject. The reasoning is not only irresistible, but managed in a mode so simple and clear, that its force is obvious to the most ordinary capacity. Upon all subjects of morality, the preacher maintains <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rigid and inflexible monitor; neither admitting apology for that which is wrong, nor softening the difficulty of adhering to that which is right; a stern stoicism of doctrine, that may fail in finding many converts, but leads to excellence in the few manly minds who dare to embrace it. In treating the doctrinal points of belief, (as in his Sermon upon the Trinity,) Swift systematically refuses to quit the high and pre-eminent ground which the defender of Christianity is entitled to occupy, or {{to submit to the}} test of human reason, mysteries which are placed, by their very nature, far beyond our finite capacities. Swift considered, that, in religion, as in profane science, there must be certain ultimate laws which are to be received as fundamental truths, although we are incapable of defining or analysing their nature; and he censures those divines, who, in presumptuous confidence of their own logical powers, enter into controversy upon such mysteries of faith, without considering that they give thereby the most undue advantage to the infidel. Our author wisely and consistently declared reason an incompetent judge of doctrines, of which God had declared the fact, concealing from man the manner. He contended, that he who, upon the whole, receives the Christian religion as of divine inspiration, must be contented to depend upon God's truth, and his holy word, and receive with humble faith the mysteries which are too high for comprehension. Above all, Swift points out, with his usual forcible precision, the mischievous tendency of those investigations which, while they assail one fundamental doctrine of the Christian religion, shake and endanger the whole fabric, destroy the settled faith of thousands, pervert and mislead the genius of the learned and acute, destroy and confound the religious principles of the simple and ignorant.|$|E
