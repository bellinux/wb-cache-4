5|$|In {{spite of}} his {{athletic}} record and remarkable career accomplishments, Ford acquired {{a reputation as a}} clumsy, likable, and simple-minded Everyman. An incident in 1975, when he <b>tripped</b> while exiting Air Force One in Austria, was famously and repeatedly parodied by Chevy Chase, cementing Ford's image as a klutz. Pieces of Ford's common Everyman image have also been attributed to Ford's inevitable comparison to Nixon, as well as his perceived Midwestern stodginess and self-deprecation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{explores the}} interrelationship between <b>trip</b> chain pattern and <b>trip</b> mode choice based on multinomial {{logistic}} model, using 2010 Nanjing resident <b>trip</b> survey data. Unlike previous literatures, <b>trip</b> mode choice {{is divided into}} single-mode and multi-modes in this study. Estimation coefficients verify <b>trip</b> chain pattern and <b>trip</b> mode selection are a pair of choices that influence each other. <b>Trip</b> mode is great positively associated with <b>trip</b> chain pattern of HW+WH, HO+OH, HW+OH, however, in return <b>trip</b> chain pattern {{is the most significant}} negative factor that affects <b>trip</b> mode choice, which means that no <b>trip</b> chain pattern would provoke travelers to select multi-modes. Despite the results seem to reach a contradiction between <b>trip</b> chain pattern and <b>trip</b> mode choice, still two facets of views try to explain the phenomenon, in addition, discussion on the interrelationship between complex <b>trip</b> chain pattern and multi-modes which might put forward more challenges to urban planning is also proposed as well in the paper...|$|R
40|$|A {{model system}} is {{developed}} to describe both <b>trip</b> generation and <b>trip</b> chaining in a coherent manner. A recursive structure is adopted {{to represent the}} generation of <b>trips</b> for different purposes, {{and the number of}} <b>trip</b> chains is expressed {{as a function of the}} numbers of <b>trips</b> by purpose. The model system offers theoretically consistent coefficient values and quantifies the relationship between the number of <b>trips</b> and the number of <b>trip</b> chains, and can be used in the conventional forecasting procedure in place of home-based and non-home-based <b>trip</b> generation models. This model is applied to examine how <b>trip</b> chaining patterns vary across sample subgroups. The results indicate no significant variations in <b>trip</b> chaining behavior across car ownership subgroups. It is inferred that car ownership influences household <b>trip</b> generation, but given the number of <b>trips</b> generated, the number of <b>trip</b> chains is not influenced by car ownership...|$|R
5|$|Sensors {{activate}} audible sirens near each {{entrance of}} the tunnel if a vehicle above the posted height attempts to enter the tunnel. Traffic signals at that entrance will turn red, stopping all traffic. The entrance will remain closed until the vehicle {{is removed from the}} freeway, sometimes causing severe delays for all traffic. CDOT noted that prior to the retrofit, about 20,000 vehicles per year <b>tripped</b> the alarm. The trucking industry argued that many of these trucks were under the height requirement but <b>tripped</b> the alarm due to their air suspensions (which can be lowered during their journey through the tunnel) or due to snow and ice atop the trailer. During this time, the trucking industry estimated the number of alarms would drop by as much as 80% if the clearance could be raised even a few inches. Another feature of the retrofit monitors truck weightâ€”a safe speed for each truck on the 7% grades and curves just outside the tunnel is calculated and displayed for each driver.|$|E
5|$|The All Blacks {{then headed}} to Limerick for their one other game in Ireland. Not {{all of the}} team {{travelled}} for the match against Munster, and Dixon had even {{tried to get the}} All Blacks out of the game. The match played on Tuesday 28 November was won 33â€“0 by the All Blacks. The eight tries witnessed by the 3,000 strong crowd included a penalty try after Fred Roberts was <b>tripped</b> close to the line.|$|E
5|$|The {{first game}} was close at the halfway point, Ottawa leading Dawson three to one. In the second half, the play became violent. Norman Watt of Dawson <b>tripped</b> Ottawa's Art Moore, who retaliated {{with a stick}} {{to the mouth of}} Watt. Watt {{promptly}} knocked Moore out, hitting him on the head with his stick. The game ended 9â€“2 for Ottawa. The game left a poor taste in the mouth for the Yukoners, who complained that several goals were offside.|$|E

5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures {{were taken in}} response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, the power grid {{was taken out of}} commission, as circuit breakers <b>tripped</b> all over Quebec and shut off the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire transmission grid out of service. The collapsed power grid left six million people and the rest of Quebec without electricity for hours on a very cold night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for most places, some locations were in the dark for days. This geomagnetic storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-QuÃ©bec and tens of millions to the customers of the utility.|$|E
5|$|As the {{fighting}} was seemingly coming to an end, Carmelo Anthony confronted Collins and punched him in the face, knocking him to the ground. Jared Jeffries immediately tried to attack Anthony but <b>tripped</b> over Marcus Camby, before being restrained by coaches and teammates, while Anthony backed up towards the Nuggets' bench. Collins also ran down the court to get at Anthony but was blocked by NenÃª and Smith. All ten players on the court {{at the time of}} the incident were ejected by the officiating crew that consisted of Dick Bavetta, Violet Palmer, and Robbie Robinson.|$|E

The trauma induced labor and she gave birth prematurely to a son. The queen succumbed to the fatal injuries; being far from any kind of assistance, her son died as well. She was buried in the cathedral of VÃ¡rad (now Oradea in Romania). Mary's sister, Jadwiga, claimed the crown, but Sigismund retained it without much difficulty.|$|E
5|$|Stewart {{was born}} on 13 June 1976. When she was 17 years old she injured her right ankle when she <b>tripped</b> on the stairs. This {{developed}} into reflex sympathetic dystrophy.

She has BSc (Honours) in Philosophy and Cognitive Science and a BA in English from the University of New South Wales.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{models that}} predict two recreational fishing <b>trip</b> parameters: {{the length of}} a <b>trip</b> and the timing of a <b>trip</b> within a year.

A Tobit model is used to evaluate the relationship between fishing <b>trip</b> length and personal and <b>trip</b> characteristics.

40|$|The {{graduation}} thesis estimates <b>trip</b> generation {{for shopping}} center Qlandia Kranj. <b>Trip</b> generation is {{first step in}} four-step traffic forecast process {{which is used to}} estimate traffic volume or the number of <b>trips</b> in the area of interest. The number of <b>trips</b> depends on various factors which are connected to land use, socio-economic characteristics of the people and characteristics of transportation system. The variable with the biggest impact on <b>trip</b> generation is land use. Larger sites and also sites with more urban activity generate more <b>trips.</b> The chosen method for <b>trip</b> generation estimation is described in <b>Trip</b> Generation Handbook issued by ITE. This method is based on abundance of collected data from sites all across USA and Canada. <b>Trip</b> generation rates and regression equations extracted from this data connect the number of <b>trips</b> to characteristics of site. Rates and equations can be adjusted to correspond to the location of the site. The result of <b>trip</b> generation analysis is the number of <b>trips</b> IN and OUT of the site. Equations and rates for various land uses are published in the ITE handbook. Feature with the biggest impact on the number of <b>trips</b> should be chosen as independent variable. Additional factors affecting <b>trip</b> generation are modal split, internal <b>trips</b> and by-pass <b>trips.</b> I used the method described in ITE handbook to estimate <b>trip</b> generation of Qlandia Kranj. Independent variable was shopping center's sales area. I compared estimated <b>trip</b> generation data with traffic count performed on the site...|$|R
