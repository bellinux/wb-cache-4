50|$|Although the <b>tilting</b> <b>cab</b> gives {{comparatively}} unobstructed {{access to}} the engine, its deployment causes unsecured items in the cab and sleeper (if equipped) to fall onto the windshield or under the instrument panel. Vehicles without a <b>tilting</b> <b>cab</b> will usually be equipped with removable floor panels through which mechanics can access and service the engine. Unfortunately, some components might require servicing or replacement that either will not fit through the hatch or remain inaccessible. This necessitates removal of the engine by lowering it {{out from under the}} vehicle, a time-consuming and expensive procedure.|$|R
5000|$|... 1959 saw the {{introduction}} of the refined L485 Viking, including a stronger chassis. [...] From 1961, the truck was available with a turbodiesel. In 1964 Volvo introduced the forward control L4851 Viking Tiptop with a <b>tilting</b> <b>cab.</b>|$|R

5000|$|At {{least four}} truck makers used the Ford C-Series <b>tilt</b> <b>cab.</b> Best known was the look-alike Mack model [...] "N", which was {{produced}} between 1958 and 1962. The Four-Wheel-Drive Auto Company used some Ford [...] "C" [...] cabs which bore the FWD emblems, and Yankee-Walter used C-series cab components {{on some of}} its large airport crash trucks. In Canada, the Thibault fire truck manufacturer of Pierreville, Quebec, also used C-series parts for their Custom (i.e. non-commercial chassis) trucks.|$|E
50|$|F241 is {{the name}} of a cab used on a series of heavy-duty, mostly long {{distance}} trucks produced by the Dutch manufacturer DAF from 1973 until 1994. They are better known as the DAF 2800, 3300 and 3600. The cab was a wider development of the F218, DAF's first <b>tilt</b> <b>cab</b> placed on among others 2500. The names reflect the cab width in centimetres, at 218 and 241 cm respectively. The cab was also used by Hungary's R√ÅBA for various applications.|$|E
5000|$|... 1958 saw the {{introduction}} of lightweight glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) used in cab production and {{this led to the}} manufacture of the first British-built, mass-produced tilting cab in 1962. The first Foden GRP cab was the distinctively-styled S21 model. The S21 was initially nicknamed both [...] "Spaceship" [...] and [...] "Sputnik" [...] by the commercial vehicle press but was more popular by the [...] "Mickey Mouse" [...] nickname. The more traditional metal-and-wood S20 cab, introduced in 1956, was still fitted to many Foden lorries until at least 1963, after which it was just fitted to special vehicles until 1968. The aforementioned GRP <b>tilt</b> <b>cab,</b> introduced in 1962, was designated S24.|$|E
50|$|The Dennis SS {{was almost}} {{identical}} {{with the previous}} RS model. It incorporated the same cab design, engine and transmission, except the SS (Split Steel) had a <b>tilting</b> <b>cab</b> which made maintenance and overhaul much easier. It could be fitted {{with a variety of}} bodies by Dennis and other coachbuilders such as JDC, Carmichael and Fulton Wylie.|$|R
50|$|The {{cluster of}} warning {{lights on the}} {{dashboard}} of the Land Rover was modified {{in anticipation of the}} launch of the Llama to include a new light. This carried the symbol of a <b>tilting</b> lorry <b>cab</b> with a large exclamation mark. Its purpose would have been to warn the driver of a Llama if the locking mechanism for the <b>tilting</b> <b>cab</b> was unlocked. This new cluster was fitted to all Land Rovers from mid-1987 (with the cab-lock warning light not wired in, obviously). This design of warning light cluster remained in use on Land Rover Defenders until 1998, 10 years after the Llama project was cancelled.|$|R

5000|$|The cab was a re-worked {{version of}} the [...] "Ergomatic" [...] <b>tilt</b> <b>cab</b> of 1965, heavily {{modified}} with different lower panels, raised height etc., and was available in day and sleeper cab form. Engines were decided from the outset {{to be in the}} higher power category to be competitive with rival vehicles. The only existing engine within the Leyland empire suitable for such an application (following the demise of the ill-fated fixed-head 500 series and AEC's underdeveloped and unreliable V8) was the AEC AV760 straight-six, which was turbocharged and designated as the TL12. Other engine options included a 200 bhp Leyland L11, as well as Cummins 10- and 14-litre engines at 250 and 330 bhp, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Introduced at IAA in September 1973 the '2800' was DAF's {{replacement}} for the luxurious, but certainly not outdated 2600. The DAF 2800 had the first European intercooled turbodiesel under the hood of its new <b>tilt</b> <b>cab.</b> The 11.6 litre DKS engine produced 320 HP and 1260 Nm. Other engine choices were the turbocharged 280 HP DKTD and the naturally aspirated 250 HP DKA. While based on the modular design of the 1970 F218 cab, the front of F241 cab was redesigned and the new wider cab required {{the use of a}} set of three wipers, a distinguishing characteristic of the range. Gearboxes with 12 or 16 speed were offered from ZF, or 13 speed and twin splitter from Fuller. Cabs and engines were also delivered to Ginaf, the Dutch manufacturer of all wheel drive trucks.|$|E
50|$|Originally the 1 January 1971 merger did {{not affect}} the lineup, with Seddon and Atkinson {{continuing}} to manufacture their old truck ranges in their respective plants. In 1975, however, a new unified range was presented with modernized steel <b>tilt</b> <b>cabs</b> developed together with Motor Panels. This consisted of the 200, 300, and 400 series trucks - higher numbers corresponding to a higher weight rating.|$|R
50|$|From 1966 to 1971, Dodge built L-Series {{medium-duty}} Cabover Engine {{trucks with}} a <b>tilting</b> forward-control <b>cab</b> {{based on the}} forward body of the A-100.|$|R
5000|$|In 1959, GMC {{introduced}} its Class 8 cabover trucks, replacing the previous [...] "Cannonball" [...] fixed-cab COEs. Distinguished by its boxy appearance, it became nicknamed the [...] "Crackerbox". [...] Available in a 48-inch BBC (bumper to back of cab) length, {{the truck was}} produced with an all-aluminum fully <b>tilting</b> <b>cab.</b> Alongside a 702 cubic-inch GMC V12 gasoline engine, the truck was available with Detroit Diesel 6V71 and 8V71 diesels. [...] Along with single or tandem axle configurations, the GMC [...] "Crackerbox" [...] was available with a sleeper cab.|$|R
5000|$|In 1977 {{the light}} range was {{thoroughly}} modernized, with a smoothed out cabin {{and a new}} grille. The headlights were now mounted below the body, in the front bumper. A version with an air-sprung rear axle was also added. The cabin remained fixed, in a segment where most competitors had moved on to <b>tilting</b> <b>cabs.</b> New ten and eleven tonne models were added, while {{the output of the}} smallest OM 314 engine crept up to [...] The light portion of the range outlived its heavier brethren, remaining in production until 1984.|$|R
50|$|Since 1974, {{gradually}} {{started the}} production of trucks 100.45, 100.05 flatbed and other variants of vehicles from 100 series. The first trucks were obliquely motor M series with a volume of 11 940 cm¬≥ and a power of 210, in 1978 was refurbished and known as M1 and in 1988 was again modernized to M2. New units reached thanks to turbo power up to 236 kW (320 hp), and longevity to overhaul 420,000 km. New and were 9 and 10-point synchronized gearbox Praga. Modernization in 1984 brought <b>tilting</b> <b>cab</b> and air suspension front and rear axles.|$|R
50|$|The Steyr 90 {{series is}} a cab over truck {{originally}} introduced in 1968, built by Steyr-Daimler-Puch AG in Steyr, Austria. It has a <b>tilting</b> <b>cab</b> and is of a distinct shape, which survived {{into the twenty-first}} century with China's Sinotruk. In 1978 the facelifted Steyr 91 replaced the 90, and it was in turn replaced by the redesigned Steyr 92 in 1986. Considering its comparatively low production numbers an unusually wide range of models and configurations were available, necessitated by Steyr's dominance of the Austrian truck market in the period - in 1980 about 35% of trucks on the roads there were made by Steyr.|$|R
5000|$|As on the Bedford TK and {{on various}} US built heavy trucks of the time, the cabin was a flat fronted forward control unit {{positioned}} above the engine. [...] Engine access {{was achieved by}} <b>tilting</b> the entire <b>cab</b> forwards: the hinge at the front employed a torsion-bar counterbalancing system which according to commentators made <b>tilting</b> the <b>cab</b> to access the engine [...] "almost a one-hand job". [...] The engines were installed at an angle of 45 degrees from the vertical which was intended to enable the cab interior to feature a virtually flat floor without the cab itself becoming excessively tall.|$|R
50|$|The DAF F218 {{and later}} F220 {{is the name}} of a modular cab used on a series of {{medium-duty}} trucks produced by the Dutch manufacturer DAF from early 1970 until the mid-1990s. The names reflect the cab width in centimetres, at 218 and 220 cm respectively. DAF's first <b>tilting</b> <b>cab</b> design, all in steel, it also benefitted from a new 8.25 L diesel inline-six. After a thorough facelift with a new front clip {{in the style of the}} larger F241 series, the cab was renamed the F220 in 1976. The range was originally sold as the F1600 or F2000, with the new model F220 marketed as the F2300. Gradually, a number of other iterations appeared, with the range eventually stretching from the 1700 to the intercooled 2700 ATi.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s a new modular <b>tilting</b> <b>cab</b> {{called the}} F218 was {{introduced}} on the F1600/F2000 range of vehicles. Three years later, the wider F241, which featured DAF's characteristic three-wiper windscreen, was introduced as the DAF 2800. This design lasted until {{the introduction of}} the 95 style cab in 1987. There was also a lighter, narrower version called the F198 which was introduced in 1972 on the F1200 and F1400, but this short-lived model was replaced after only three years. In 1984 DAF truck production was 13,645; this increased to 14,382 in calendar year 1985. DAF {{was also one of the}} first to introduce an intercooled turbocharged diesel engine into their lorries, which in these years became very evident with their 3600. Their largest 11.6 L six-cylinder turbodiesel was based on the old Leyland O.680 motor. It was to be DAF's standard large engine long into the nineties.|$|R
5000|$|The Zeta {{was issued}} in a myriad configurations, {{as it had}} to replace a variety of {{existing}} truck lines from several different producers. Originally three different engines and four different wheelbases were offered. Single or double cabins {{as well as a}} number of van models with an available raised roof were available. A <b>tilting</b> <b>cab</b> was offered on the 7.9 ton [...] "79" [...] and was standard on heavier models. The range received a light facelift and moodel shuffle in 1979. Later more engines were added, as well as models which were tailored to suit various local markets. Iveco's naming system during the Zeta's production consisted of two sets of numbers divided by a period: the first digits reflected the gross vehicle weight (GVW) in hundreds of kilograms, while the second set reflected the power in tens of horsepower. Thus, a five-tonner with the [...] engine carries 50.10 badging.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, the Avia A Series was modernized for {{the last}} time. Avia A 60/ 65/ 75/ 80 models entered the market. The {{vehicles}} had a completely new chassis fitted with a riveted frame, fixed front axle, front disk brakes, lesser wheels 205/75 - 17,50" [...] and Euro II engines {{with the power of}} 76 kW and/or 85 kW. The vehicles were fitted with a five-speed/six-speed gear-box. The cabs had a new interior, advanced design and they were <b>tilt</b> <b>cabs</b> in the first line. Generally, 250,000 Avia A Series vehicles, which can be seen in high numbers on our roads even today, left the assembly line of the Let≈àany car factory in the period between launching the production in 1968 up to its termination, which took place on 13 November 2000. From 1997 to 1999, the Let≈àany car factory was also assembling Lublin and Lublin II, the light commercial vehicles imported disassembled from the Daewoo Motor Poland company.|$|R
50|$|What {{appeared}} to be scaled down FH cabs were initially available in three basic sizes, short day cab,sleeper cab, and globetrotter cab.Various trims and color option were available. Electric <b>cab</b> <b>tilt</b> was an option.|$|R
50|$|A new {{cab unit}} was {{introduced}} in September 1965. The Ford H Cab and Detachable Trailer (1137) was an American truck produced by Corgi {{to appeal to the}} lucrative US market and featured a forward <b>tilting</b> <b>cab</b> revealing a highly detailed engine, realistic moveable door mirrors and die-cast metal air horns and side ladders. The large box trailer featured sliding side doors, opening rear doors and was finished in the blue and silver 'Express Services' livery. The leap in quality of this model proved that the Major range had entered a new era, and it continued to sell well until 1972. The new Ford cab was used again in April 1966 with {{a new version of the}} Carrimore Car Transporter (1138) which had been re-designed to carry up to six Corgi cars, and which also featured in Gift Set 41 along with six cars; Ford Cortina Estate (440), Rover 2000 (252), Hillman Imp (251), Mini Cooper De-Luxe (249), Austin Seven (225) and Mini Cooper Monte Carlo 1966 (321). This gift set was initially only available by mail order but was finally issued in time for Christmas in December 1967.|$|R
5000|$|The third {{generation}} Elf arrived in June 1975, in Elf 150 10ft., Elf 150 14ft. 6 wheel and Elf 250 forms are standard. It was nicknamed [...] "Tora-san" [...] after Kiyoshi Atsumi's (a famous Japanese actor) most beloved film character which supposedly looked similar. In January 1977 a 250 Low-Flat model was added, followed in 1978 by a facelift and an altered front grille. In 1979 a 3.3-liter 4BC1 {{engine of the}} 2 t Elf 250 and 350 wide was introduced, called the [...] "Elf 250 Super". There was also a [...] "Elf 150 Super" [...] version, has the 2.4-liter C240 diesel engine and The 2.8 liter 4BA1 engine for the Elf 150 14ft. 6 wheel version and Elf 250 wide with heavy-duty transmission.which was usually installed in the Elf 250. In 1978 Isuzu also sold their millionth Elf. In January 1980 the Elf was updated to meet Japan's 1979 emissions standards, which was also when the design was changed to accommodate a <b>tilting</b> <b>cab.</b> The Elf 250 Wide and 350 Wide were added, with KT and KS chassis codes respectiverly, meaning that the second generation Ef 350 could finally be retired. The Elf Wide has a cabin 1910 mm wide, rather than the 1690 mm cabin used in the TL and KA series Elfs.|$|R
50|$|All trucks of {{the series}} share a modular design. They have a torsionally rigid {{box-section}} frame with highly mobile axles linked to the frame via coil springs. The engine is mounted inside the forward-control cab, which is separated into a driver and engine compartment by a firewall. As a distinctive feature, the engine is located {{to the rear of}} the driver compartment instead of beneath it. This way, the total height could be kept below 2.9 m, which means the trucks can be transported on standard railway flatcars. The characteristic, cut-away corners of the otherwise box-shaped cab ensure compliance with the railway loading gauge. The cab of the first batch does not tilt forward for maintenance because the vehicles were still based on the amphibious prototypes. The <b>tilting</b> <b>cab</b> was only introduced with the second batch in the mid-80s. The engine powers the front and rear axles via a torque converter, semi-automatic transmission and a transfer case. In the first batch KAT I, these components form a single, special unit. The later KAT I A1 series uses cheaper mass-produced, standard truck components. At the same time, this allowed to raise the number of gears from six to 16, and the theoretical top speed from 90 to about 130 km/h. This in turn led to much lower engine speeds at the usual top speed of 80 km/h, lowering fuel consumption. Vehicle voltage is standard 24 Volts. The tow hitch is a standard NATO coupling suitable for towing trailers even in difficult terrain, although they must be equipped with the matching lunette ring.|$|R
50|$|For example, if the {{occupant}} commands {{the vehicle to}} roll to the left, the visual displays must also roll by the same magnitude {{and at the same}} rate. Simultaneously, the <b>cab</b> <b>tilts</b> {{the occupant}} to imitate the motion. The occupant‚Äôs proprioceptors and vestibular system sense this motion. The motion and change in the visual inputs must align well enough such that any discrepancy is below the occupant‚Äôs threshold to detect the differences in motion.|$|R
