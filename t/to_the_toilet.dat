5|$|On 19 and 20 October, Singaporean police {{questioned}} Took as part {{of their}} investigations; he said that three Chinese men kidnapped the girl. After questioning Took, police accompanied him home and to the police station again for a polygraph test. On the way, they stopped at a restaurant along Pasir Panjang Road for a meal. While eating, Took said he needed to go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet,</b> escaped, took a taxi to Woodlands and sneaked across the Causeway to Malaysia. Singaporean police searched for him until he turned himself in on 30 October, confessing that he had accidentally strangled Huang Na during a game of hide-and-seek in a storeroom. The following day, Huang Na's body was found at Telok Blangah Hill Park, and Took was charged with her murder. Direct Singapore Funeral Services oversaw her funeral for free. Thousands attended Huang Na's wake and funeral; some gave bai jin and gifts, such as sweets, flowers and her favourite Hello Kitty merchandise. However, some Singaporeans tried to make money from the girl's death by buying 4D numbers associated with her. Others spread rumours that Shuying was having affairs and was greedy for donations.|$|E

25|$|Primary nocturnal {{enuresis}} (PNE) is {{the most}} common form of bedwetting. Bedwetting counts as a disorder once a child is old enough to stay dry, but continues either to average at least two wet nights a week with no long periods of dryness or to not sleep dry without being taken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> by another person.|$|E
25|$|Users {{with disabilities}} {{can benefit from}} this kind of design as it is very sturdy (compared to a pedestal-type toilet). The wide bench {{provides}} space for an assistant if needed, and handrails can easily be fixed to the walls next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet.</b> Most importantly, this type of UDDT is accessible directly from the ground level and does not require access steps or ramps which are common for many UDDT designs.|$|E

25|$|In institutions, communities, and households, {{interventions}} that promote hand washing with soap lead to significant {{reductions in the}} incidence of diarrhea. <b>The</b> same applies <b>to</b> preventing open defecation at a community-wide level and providing access to improved sanitation. This includes use of toilets and implementation of the entire sanitation chain connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilets</b> (collection, transport, disposal or reuse of human excreta).|$|R
50|$|Further {{alterations}} {{were carried}} out in 1965-1966, and the successful tenderer was Del Ben and Company {{at a cost of}} £14,871. The works comprised the removal of the remaining side verandahs, additions {{at the rear of the}} side wings, internal alterations, suspended ceiling installed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reception area, alterations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilets,</b> and air conditioning to some rooms. Further internal alterations have occurred after this time.|$|R
25|$|Doors can be hinged so {{that the}} axis of {{rotation}} {{is not in the}} plane of the door to reduce the space required on the side to which the door opens. This requires a mechanism {{so that the}} axis of rotation is on the side other than that in which the door opens. This is sometimes the case in trains or airplanes, such as for the door <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet,</b> which opens inward.|$|E
25|$|Extravagant {{courses are}} served while Trimalchio flaunts his wealth and his pretence of {{learning}} (31–41). Trimalchio's departure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> (he is incontinent) allows space for conversation {{among the guests}} (41–46). Encolpius listens to their ordinary talk about their neighbours, about the weather, about the hard times, about the public games, and about the education of their children. In his insightful depiction of everyday Roman life, Petronius delights in exposing the vulgarity and pretentiousness of the illiterate and ostentatious wealthy of his age.|$|E
25|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} a disease of old age: It {{typically}} originates in the secretory cells lining the gut, and risk factors include diets low in vegetable fibre and high in fat. If a younger person gets such a cancer, it {{is often associated with}} hereditary syndromes like Peutz-Jegher's, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or familial adenomatous polyposis. Colorectal cancer can be detected through the bleeding of a polyp, colicky bowel pain, a bowel obstruction or the biopsy of a polyp at a screening colonoscopy. A constant feeling of having to go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> or anemia might also point to this kind of cancer.|$|E

50|$|The {{child must}} be taught <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> {{regularly}} <b>to</b> retrain his/her body. It is usually recommended that a child be required <b>to</b> sit on <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> at a regular time each day and 'try' to go for 10-15 minutes, usually soon (or immediately) after eating. Children {{are more likely to}} be able to expel a bowel movement right after eating. It is thought that creating a regular schedule of bathroom time will allow <b>the</b> child <b>to</b> achieve a proper elimination pattern. Repeated voiding success on <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> itself helps it become a releasor stimulus for successful bowel movements.|$|R

25|$|A Roomette, in the {{historically}} correct {{sense of the}} word, is a private room for a single passenger, containing a single seat, a folding bed, a toilet (not in a private cubicle of its own), and a washbasin. When a traditional Roomette is in night mode, the bed blocks access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet.</b> Like open sections, Roomettes {{are placed on both}} sides of the car, with a corridor down the center. Duplex Roomettes are staggered vertically, with every second accommodation raised a few feet above the car's floor level, in order to make slightly more efficient use of the space. Single-passenger Slumbercoach accommodations are a particularly Spartan form of Roomette.|$|E

At the beginning of every episode, after the titles had aired, a prerecorded segment was played in which the presenters emerged from the lift in the studio in a costume (e.g. Aeroplanes) whilst a song relating to the costume was played.

50|$|Brac Systems {{began with}} the {{development}} of the GRS greywater recycling systems in 2005. Later, it manufactured and marketed greywater, rainwater and blackwater recycling systems. Brac's residential greywater recycling systems (RGW Systems) capture greywater from the showers, bathtubs, lavatories and laundry washing machines after which it's redistributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilets</b> or used for irrigation. Based upon statistics from Environment Canada, the company asserted that the use of their system will cut the average home's water consumption and sewage effluent by approximately one third.|$|R
25|$|UDDTs {{are often}} {{considered}} synonymous with ecosan (ecological sanitation) or with composting toilets. However, {{neither of these}} associations is correct. Not all UDDTs are {{used in conjunction with}} the practice of reusing excreta. There are many other ecosan technologies that hygienically return nutrients <b>to</b> <b>the</b> food chain, such as subsurface artificial wetlands that produce fodder for cows. Also, there is usually little composting taking place in the UDDT vaults (instead, it might be carried out in a secondary composting step which is external <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilets).</b>|$|R
25|$|Following on, Laborit {{considered}} whether chlorpromazine {{may have}} a role in managing patients with severe burns, Raynaud's phenomenon, or psychiatric disorders. At the Villejuif Mental Hospital in November 1951, he and Montassut administered an intravenous dose to psychiatrist Cornelia Quarti who was acting as a volunteer. Quarti noted the indifference, but fainted upon getting up to go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet,</b> and so further testing was discontinued (orthostatic hypotension is a possible side effect of chlorpromazine). Despite this, Laborit continued to push for testing in psychiatric patients during early 1952. Psychiatrists were reluctant initially, but on January 19, 1952, it was administered (alongside pethidine, pentothal and ECT) to Jacques Lh. a 24-year-old manic patient, who responded dramatically, and was discharged after three weeks having received 855mg of the drug in total.|$|E

When they were halfway down the stairs, Stojanović shouted [...] "Fire!" [...] as smoke came from a room on the second floor. During the commotion of the guards and hostages extinguishing the fire, Stojanović entered the toilet and escaped through the window. He went to the village of Orlovci, several kilometres from Prijedor, where he was accompanied by Rade Bašića young communist who had earlier escaped from the town. Bašić escorted Stojanović toward Mount Kozara ( [...] high), north of the Prijedor plain.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study about hygiene in train <b>toilets.</b> <b>The</b> central problem is that with <b>the</b> existing train <b>toilet</b> design and <b>the</b> different groups of users it is impossible <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> train <b>toilet</b> clean. In a conventional train, it is especially difficult for men to urinate without spilling urine outside the bowl while standing. This, sometimes invisible spray of urine drops on <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> seat, smells strongly and feels wet. Therefore women and men are reluctant <b>to</b> sit on <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> seat. It also causes women to hover while urinating and as a consequence they add <b>to</b> <b>the</b> soiling of <b>the</b> seat. <b>To</b> break this negative spiral, the solution for experiencing better hygiene in a train <b>toilet</b> is <b>to</b> divide <b>the</b> train <b>toilet</b> into two separate modules: a urinal for men (standing) and a family seated toilet for others.

500|$|There {{were two}} space toilets (ASUs) on Mir, {{located in the}} core module and Kvant-2. They used a fan-driven suction system similar to the Space Shuttle Waste Collection System. The user is first {{fastened}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> seat, which was equipped with spring-loaded restraining bars to ensure a good seal. A lever operated a powerful fan and a suction hole slid open: the air stream carried the waste away. Solid waste was collected in individual bags which were stored in an aluminium container. Full containers were transferred to Progress spacecraft for disposal. Liquid waste was evacuated by a hose connected {{to the front of}} the toilet, with anatomically appropriate [...] "urine funnel adapters" [...] attached to the tube so both men and women could use the same toilet. Waste was collected and transferred to the Water Recovery System, where it was recycled back into drinking water, although this was usually used to produce oxygen via the Elektron system.|$|E
