40|$|How {{much can}} we turn the screw on counter-examples to the KK principle? The principle, also {{sometimes}} called “positive introspection”, says <b>that</b> if <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P, <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P. It is widely, although not universally, {{acknowledged that the}} KK principle is false, {{and not just for}} the boring reason <b>that</b> <b>one</b> can know <b>that</b> P without having formed the belief <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P. <b>One</b> can know <b>that</b> P, and believe <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P, without knowing <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P, because <b>one</b> is not in a strong enough epistemic position to know <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P (Williamson 2000 : 114 - 30). One’s epistemic position is weaker with respect to the fact <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P than it is with respect to the fact that P itself. But how much weaker can one’s epistemic position be with respect to the fact <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P than it is with respect to the fact that P? Of course, if <b>one</b> does know <b>that</b> P, <b>one’s</b> epistemic position with respect to the fact <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P cannot be so bad <b>that</b> <b>one</b> positively knows <b>that</b> <b>one</b> does not know that P, as opposed to merely failing to know <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P, for knowing is 1 factive: one can know only what is indeed the case. But we can ask a more grade...|$|R

40|$|Can’t <b>one</b> truly judge <b>that</b> <b>one</b> is judging? Matthew Soteriou {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} authoritatively knowing one’s own mental acts which depends on a surprising assumption: One cannot truly judge <b>that</b> <b>one</b> is judging. After briefly criticizing his account of <b>one’s</b> awareness <b>that</b> <b>one</b> is judging, I critically scrutinize two of his arguments against the possibility of truly judging <b>that</b> <b>one</b> is judging. Firstly, assuming such a possibility leads to a regress. Secondly, the second-order judgement inevitably replaces the first-order judgement such as to make the former wrong. Matthew Soteriou (2005) has provided a thorough analysis of our intuitive claims to be directly and authoritatively aware of our own mental activity. Soteriou opposes non-occurrent belief and conscious judgement. The latter is a mental act, the former is not. Conscious judgement is identified with occurrent belief (Soteriou 2005, 96). While one can have a non-occurrent belief <b>that</b> <b>one</b> is believing <b>that</b> p despite not believing <b>that</b> p, <b>one’s</b> non-occurrent belief <b>that</b> <b>one</b> is now judging that p cannot be subject to such a mistake. Whenever <b>one</b> is judging <b>that</b> p, <b>one</b> has a non-occurrent belief <b>that</b> <b>one</b> is judging <b>that</b> p (Soteriou 2005, 95). Whenever one has a non-occurrent belief <b>that</b> <b>one</b> is judging <b>that</b> p, this belief cannot be false...|$|R

5000|$|Having worked {{together}} in the MBC omnibus drama Beating Heart (2005), actress Bae Doona recommended Go to director Bong Joon-ho when he was casting for his much-anticipated monster film. After an extensive audition process, Go made her film debut in 2006 with a starring role in The Host. Bong praised her work, saying that she [...] "showed really mature acting for her age, and <b>thats</b> <b>one</b> of her defining charms as an actress." [...] Go was also applauded by film critics, with Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post complimenting her [...] "exquisite performance," [...] and Megan Ratner of the Bright Lights Film Journal noting her [...] "unforced naturalness, reminiscent not only of Ana Torrent but of Zazies Catherine Demongeot." [...] Go received several acting nominations, and won Best New Actress at the 2006 Blue Dragon Film Awards.|$|E
5000|$|Asked {{how does}} he think that the album has aged, Dave Mustaine responded: [...] "I think its timely and {{timeless}} at the same time, and I think <b>thats</b> <b>one</b> {{of the most difficult}} things for a musician to do. Very few records in our genre are like that. Musically its heavy and the lyrics are very symbolic." [...] In the liner notes of the albums 20th anniversary edition, music journalist Kory Grow wrote that [...] "thanks to a perfect balance of hard-rock song structures, epic choruses, and fleet-fingered guitar work, Countdown to Extinction became an instant classic, benefiting from copious MTV and radio play." [...] Artistdirect editor in chief Rick Florino called the album a [...] "seminal" [...] release and commented that it [...] "changed the game by preserving the bands thrash intensity and impressive technical prowess, while dropping some of the biggest hooks the genre had ever seen". In a retrospective review of the album, Craig Hayes from Popmatters wrote that Countdown to Extinctions [...] "status as a gateway metal album is indisputable" [...] and its [...] "popularity speaks volumes about its significance in the metal canon".|$|E

[...] Will Leitch of New York magazine said the episode marked a [...] "major step" [...] for the series and had some particularly sweet moments between Michael and Pam.

5000|$|The Blackhawks {{have worked}} with the American Indian Center to help educate their {{community}} and fan base by sharing Native American culture and history. Scott Sypolt, executive counsel for the American Indian Center, commented on the logo and name controversy: Joe Podlasek, {{the executive director of}} the American Indian Center of Chicago, commented on their relationship, stating, [...] "Hawks are far and away ahead of everyone else in forward-thinking. What they have done is engaged the community. In the other cities (organizations) want nothing to do with native people but yet theyre trying to say they respect us." [...] However, this stance is markedly different from the one taken by the American Indian Center up until recent years. In 2010, Joe Podlasek stated that, [...] "The stance is very clear. We want the Chicago Blackhawks logo to change. For us, <b>thats</b> <b>one</b> of our grandfathers. Would you do that with your grandfathers picture? Take it and throw it on a rug? Walk on it and dance on it?" [...] John Blackhawk, Chairman of the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, has suggested that the change in position may be tied to contributions the team has recently begun making to the center: [...] "We all do contributions, but we dont do it for the sake of wanting to be forgiven for something weve done thats offensive." ...|$|E

[...] But she revealed that [...] "it contains no surprises, but then, besides her voice, <b>thats</b> <b>one</b> of Dions biggest assets." [...] In a more positive review, Entertainment Weeklys Elisabeth Vincentelli questioned [...] "why Celine get so little respect?" [...] and later went to praise the album for [...] "Dions uncanny ability to infuse sincerity into aural Hallmark cards and sound like the only person on earth who believes in true love." [...] In the end, she wrote: [...] "And in our age of postmodern ironists, isnt it refreshing to encounter someone who so genuinely loves her job?" [...] Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani praised [...] "the album as a whole", saying that [...] "she continues the restrained approach of her last record, both in production and performance." [...] He finished the review, noting that [...] "One Heart may be the smartest album Dion could make {{at this stage in}} her career." [...] Billboard praised the album by concluding: [...] "One Heart may not crackle with the noise of an [...] "event" [...] record, but it succeeds at something far more important: It is a fine piece of music." ...|$|E
