30|$|In {{spite of}} the {{importance}} of the ATE task, there is not a consensus what is a term. Most of the terms are nominal units since they designate concepts (e.g., to denominate/give a name to some concept). Because of that, the nouns are more studied in specific domains [23]. We sustain such statement using Sager’s example [24]: ‘concepts represented in <b>terminological</b> <b>dictionaries</b> are predominantly expressed by the linguistic form of nouns’. Taking into account that terms are the entries of such dictionaries, we may consider that nouns are usually used as terms. Another example is the work of Batista [25], which affirms that terms from the business domain in Brazilian Portuguese are commonly nouns.|$|R

40|$|A {{scientific}} vocabulary {{is a set}} {{of terms}} that designate scientific concepts. This set of lexical units can be used in several applications ranging from the development of <b>terminological</b> <b>dictionaries</b> and machine translation systems to the development of lexical databases and beyond. Even though automatic term recognition systems exist since the 80 s, this process is still mainly done by hand, since it generally yields more accurate results, although not in less time and at a higher cost. Some of the reasons for this are the fairly low precision and recall results obtained, the domain dependence of existing tools and the lack of available semantic knowledge needed to validate these results. In this paper we present a method that uses Wikipedia as a semantic knowledge resource, to validate term candidates from a set of scientific text books used {{in the last three years}} of high school for mathematics, health education and ecology.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThis {{research}} {{is in the}} area of lexicography and investigates the relationship between Shona terminology development and the culture of the language community for which the terminology is intended. It is a contextual analysis of compound nouns found in Shona <b>terminological</b> <b>dictionaries.</b> The study specifically explores how lexicographers together with health, music, language and literature specialists make use of their knowledge about Shona cultural contexts in the creation of compound nouns. Thus, this research foregrounds Shona socio-cultural contexts and meaning generation in terminology development. This study employs a quadruple conceptual framework. The four components of the framework that are utilised are the Traditional Descriptive Approach (TDA), Cognitive Approach (CG), Systemic Functional Approach (SFL), and Semiotic Remediation (SRM). TDA is used in the linguistic categorisation of Shona compound nouns. In addition, it provides the metalanguage with which to describe the constituent parts of Shona compound nouns. As TDA is mainly confined to the linguistic dimension, this research employs CG, SFL, and SRM to explore the cultural and socio-cognitive dimensions of terminology development. South Afric...|$|R
