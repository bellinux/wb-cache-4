500|$|Following {{the success}} of The Dark Knight, Eckhart next {{appeared}} in Alan Ball's Towelhead (2008), an adaption of the Alicia Erian novel of the same name, in which he played a Gulf War Army reservist who sexually abuses his 13-year-old Arab-American neighbor. The film was screened under the name Nothing is Private at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. When he was first approached for the role, Eckhart revealed {{that he did not}} want to play a [...] "pedophile". When asked about the sex scenes, Eckhart said: [...] "Those were difficult times.... The way I did it was to really trust Alan. It was in the words. I really trusted Summer , and I tried to get her <b>to</b> <b>trust</b> <b>me,</b> to build a relationship when we were doing physical scenes. We'd really rehearse them mechanically, and I'd say, 'OK, I'm going to put my hand here, I'm going to do this.'... I think I found it more difficult." [...] Towelhead was critically and financially unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|Pamela's {{marriage}} to Bobby Ewing {{is central to}} understanding her character. The couple produced the opening scene of Dallas when the show first aired in 1978, with Bobby bringing his new bride home to meet Jock and Miss Ellie Ewing. [...] Their complex relationship has often been {{compared to that of}} Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. When asked about whether or not series creator David Jacobs had this parallel relationship in mind from the start, he said: [...] "Yes, guilty (laughs)". Relations can be made from William Shakespeare's two feuding families in Romeo and Juliet, the Montagues and the Capulets. These families represent the Barnes and the Ewing feuding families, with Pamela being portrayed as Juliet Capulet and Bobby as Romeo Montague. According to Patrick Duffy, being immediately paired off with Principal was a challenge. He said, [...] "We were {{in a constant state of}} competition. We were very territorial in front of the camera, and it was a strain." [...] However, their off-screen relationship significantly improved in the show's third season, with Duffy explaining: [...] "I developed an appreciation for her, and I think for the first time she started <b>to</b> <b>trust</b> <b>me.</b> Some of the best scenes on the show were between Victoria and me, and they happened after we got comfortable with each other." ...|$|E

If {{you want to write}} to her, enclose a note <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Trust</b> <b>me,</b> she shall have it.|$|R

6000|$|He {{answered}} with a grave kindness, [...] "I know {{it was hard for}} you <b>to</b> quite <b>trust</b> <b>me</b> then, for <b>to</b> <b>trust</b> such violence needs to understand, and I take it that you do not, that you cannot, <b>trust</b> <b>me</b> now, for you do not yet understand. And there may be more times when I shall want you <b>to</b> <b>trust</b> when you cannot, and may not, and must not yet understand.

Then you shall bless me from first to last for your own sake, {{and for the sake of}} others, and for her dear sake to whom I swore to protect." ...|$|R
