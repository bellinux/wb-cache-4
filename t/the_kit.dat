5|$|Chelsea's kit {{has been}} {{manufactured}} by Nike since July 2017. Previously, <b>the</b> <b>kit</b> was manufactured by Adidas, which was originally contracted {{to supply the}} club's kit from 2006 to 2018. The partnership was extended in October 2010 in a deal worth £160million over eight years. This deal was again extended in June 2013 in a deal worth £300million over another ten years. In May 2016, Adidas announced that by mutual agreement, <b>the</b> <b>kit</b> sponsorship would end six years early on 30 June 2017. Chelsea had to pay £40m in compensation to Adidas. In October 2016, Nike was announced as the new kit sponsor, in a deal worth £900m over 15 years, until 2032. Previously, <b>the</b> <b>kit</b> was manufactured by Umbro (1975–81), Le Coq Sportif (1981–86), The Chelsea Collection (1986–87), Umbro (1987–2006), and Adidas (2006–2017).|$|E

5|$|John Newcomer led {{development}} again, {{which began}} {{to create a}} kit allowing arcade owners to convert an existing cabinet into another game.

5|$|Kit changes {{had been}} {{introduced}} in the late 1930s. The 1937 season saw Palace field a shirt of claret and blue stripes, before adopting white shirts and black shorts for the following eleven seasons. The club reverted to claret and blue in 1948, but any attempt at changing <b>the</b> <b>kit</b> to change their luck backfired as the club had their worst season to date, finishing bottom and celebrating twenty-five years in League Football by applying for re-election for the first time. Palace kept their place, changed <b>the</b> <b>kit</b> back to white shirts and black shorts, and finished seventh the following season. They followed this up with another bottom place and re-election in 1951, with the unwanted record of scoring the lowest number of goals in a Division Three South season. Palace would remain in {{the bottom half of}} the table until the League was restructured in 1958, requiring re-election a third and final time in 1956, with only Swindon keeping them from bottom spot that season.|$|E

5|$|On Christmas Day 1957, Graves gave Starkey a {{second-hand}} drum kit {{consisting of}} a snare drum, bass drum and a makeshift cymbal fashioned from a rubbish bin lid. Although basic and crude, <b>the</b> <b>kit</b> facilitated his progression as a musician while increasing the commercial potential of the Eddie Clayton band, {{who went on to}} book prestigious local gigs before the skiffle craze faded in early 1958 as American rock and roll became popular in the UK.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>KIT</b> gene encodes {{a protein}} called steel factor receptor, which is {{critical}} to the differentiation of stem cells into blood cells, sperm cells, and pigment cells. A process called alternative splicing, which uses the information encoded in <b>the</b> <b>KIT</b> gene to make slightly different proteins (isoforms) for use in different circumstances, may impact whether a mutation on KIT affects blood cells, sperm cells, or pigment cells. Steel factor receptor interacts chemically with steel factor or stem cell factor to relay chemical messages. These messages are used during embryonic development to signal the migration of early melanocytes (pigment cells) from the neural crest tissue to their eventual destinations in the dermal layer. The neural crest is a transient tissue in the embryo that lies along the dorsal line. Melanocytes migrate along the dorsal line to a number of specific sites: near the eye, near the ear, and the top of the head; six sites along each side of the body, and a few along the tail. At these sites, the cells undergo a few rounds of replication and differentiation, and then migrate down and around the body from the dorsal aspect towards the ventral aspect and the limb buds.|$|E

5|$|The {{assembly}} kit consisted of eight groups of components, plus a carry case. The build time was advertised as being around three hours, and required {{a soldering iron}} {{and a pair of}} cutters.

5|$|The grocery-store chain ICA had {{sponsored}} IFK Göteborg since 1974, {{and their}} logo was {{displayed on the}} chest of the shirt 1980–2010, leading some to consider it {{an integral part of}} the shirt. The ICA logo was reproduced in its original red colour for the first few years, but was then changed to a blue-and-white version to better blend with <b>the</b> <b>kit</b> colours.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} colours of all IFK {{associations are}} blue and white, and IFK Göteborg is no exception. Soon after the club's foundation in 1904, {{it was decided}} that <b>the</b> <b>kit</b> should consist of a blue and white striped shirt with blue shorts. But the design was too costly and instead a cheaper alternative was used. Thus the club's first kit used a blue shirt with a single horizontal white stripe and a four-pointed star, one of the IFK association symbols, in white on the chest. During the next few years, white or blue shirts without stripes were used. In 1910, a kit comprising a blue and white vertically striped shirt and blue shorts was used for the first time inspired by <b>the</b> <b>kit</b> of Kjøbenhavns Boldklub. This kit has remained as the home colours ever since. The small amount of sponsor logos, together with the longtime use of blue and white stripes, has made <b>the</b> <b>kit</b> a classic in Swedish football. The most common away kit has been red and white in different styles, though other colour combinations, for example orange and white, have been used, mainly in the 1990s and 2000s. The away kit introduced in 2005 once again used red and white. An almost completely white third kit with blue details was introduced in mid-2007 after requests from supporters. In the 2010s, the away-kit colours have seen much variation, including a pink shirt with black shorts, a black kit with light-grey details, the more traditional red kit with white trimmings, and a purple kit with white details introduced in 2016.|$|E
50|$|From their {{foundation}} to the 2013-14 season, <b>the</b> Ospreys <b>kit</b> suppliers were Kooga.

50|$|The long-tailed weasel mates in July-August, with {{implantation}} of the fertilized egg on the uterine wall being {{delayed until}} about March. The gestation period lasts 10 months, with actual embryonic development taking place {{only during the}} last four weeks of this period, an adaptation to timing births for spring, when small mammals are abundant. Litter size generally consists of 5-8 kits, which are born in April-May. <b>The</b> <b>kits</b> are born partially naked, blind and weighing 3 grams, about the same weight of a hummingbird. The long-tailed weasel's growth rate is rapid, as {{by the age of}} three weeks, <b>the</b> <b>kits</b> are well furred, can crawl outside the nest and eat meat. At this time, <b>the</b> <b>kits</b> weigh 21-27 grams. At five weeks of age, <b>the</b> <b>kit's</b> eyes open, and the young become physically active and vocal. Weaning begins at this stage, with <b>the</b> <b>kits</b> emerging from <b>the</b> nest and accompanying the mother in hunting trips a week later. <b>The</b> <b>kits</b> are fully grown by autumn, at which time the family disbands. The females are able to breed at 3-4 months of age, while males become sexually mature at 15-18 months.|$|R

5|$|These alleles do {{not account}} for all dominantly {{inherited}} white spotting in horses. More KIT alleles {{are expected to be}} found with roles in white spotting.

5|$|Each Clan has an {{identical}} hierarchical system. From birth, newborn kittens {{are known as}} ‘kits’, {{as evidenced by the}} ‘-kit’ suffix {{at the end of their}} name. Parents of the kits choose the names; often, a name is related to their appearance (‘Graykit’), an element of nature (‘Sandkit’), or in regards to how the parent felt when <b>the</b> <b>kit</b> was born (‘Brokenkit’). Mothers, known as ‘queens’, then look after their kits for their first six months of life. Kits are expected to stay in camp at all times, and sleep in a designated and comfortable area known as the ‘nursery’.|$|E

5|$|Ford Australia's {{performance}} vehicle partner Ford Performance Vehicles {{produced a}} range of models based on the Falcon BA and marketed under the FPV name.
