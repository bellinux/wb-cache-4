5|$|A February 2000 {{story about}} organic {{vegetables}} on 20/20 included statements by Stossel that tests {{had shown that}} neither organic nor conventional produce samples contained any pesticide residue, and that organic food {{was more likely to}} be contaminated by E. coli bacteria. The Environmental Working Group objected to his report, mainly questioning his statements about bacteria, but also managed to determine that the produce had never been tested for pesticides. They communicated this to Stossel, but after the story's producer backed Stossel's statement that the test results had been as described, the story was rebroadcast months later, unchanged, and with a postscript in which Stossel reiterated his claim. Later, after a report in The New York Times confirmed the Environmental Working Group's claims, ABC News suspended the producer of the segment for a month and reprimanded Stossel. Stossel apologized, saying that he had thought the tests had been conducted as reported. However, he asserted that <b>the</b> <b>gist</b> <b>of</b> his report had been accurate.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} Wiśniowiecki also {{engaged in a}} {{political}} conflict over nobility titles, in particular, the title of prince (kniaź). The nobility in the Commonwealth was officially equal, and used different and non-hereditary titles than those found in {{rest of the world}} (see officials of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth); <b>the</b> <b>gist</b> <b>of</b> the conflict, which took much of the Sejm's time around 1638–41, revolved around whether old prince titles (awarded to families before their lands were incorporated into the Commonwealth in the 1569 Union of Lublin), and the new titles, awarded more recently by some foreign courts, should be recognized. Wiśniowiecki was one of the chief participants in this debate, successfully defending the old titles, including that of his own family, and succeeding in abolishing the new titles, which gained him the enmity of another powerful magnate, Jerzy Ossoliński. Other than this conflict, in his years as a deputy (1635–46), Jeremi wasn't involved in any major political issues, and only twice (in 1640 and 1642) he served in the minor function of a commissar for investigating the eastern and southern border disputes.|$|E
5|$|Robert Baer (a former North Jersey {{prosecutor}} and municipal judge) lost {{a breach of}} contract lawsuit he filed against Chase {{in federal court in}} Trenton, New Jersey, alleging he helped create the show, but Baer won a ruling that a jury should decide if and how much Baer should be paid for services as a location scout, researcher, and consultant. <b>The</b> <b>gist</b> <b>of</b> Baer's argument: in addition to Chase's own sources and ideas, some characters, settings, and storylines portrayed in The Sopranos were allegedly inspired by tours and conversations the series creator had with Tony Spirito ("a restaurateur and admitted gambler who says he often did 'favors' such as chauffeuring for wiseguys he had known all his life. His old pals included reputed notorious figure John 'Uncle Johnny' Riggi and Louis 'Fat Lou' LaRasso, a late underboss of the DeCavalcante crime family"), Thomas Koczur (a homicide detective for the Elizabeth Police Department), and people Spirito and Koczur introduced Chase to, in addition to communications and input provided by Baer, who'd introduced Chase to Spirito and Koczur in the first place.|$|E

40|$|The Carney triad (CT) is {{gastrointestinal}} stromal tumor (GIST), paraganglioma, and pulmonary chondroma. <b>The</b> <b>GISTs</b> <b>of</b> CT show different clinical, molecular, and morphologic {{features to}} usual adult GISTs but {{are similar to}} <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> pediatric <b>GISTs.</b> We postulated that these GISTs would show negative staining for succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB). We performed SDHB immunohistochemistry on GISTs arising in 5 individuals with CT, 1 child, 7 individuals with GIST in young adulthood including 2 with germline KIT mutations, 3 individuals with neurofibromatosis 1, one 63 -year-old female with multifocal gastric epithelioid GIST with lymph node metastases, and 104 consecutive unselected individuals with apparently sporadic <b>GIST.</b> <b>The</b> <b>GISTs</b> and paragangliomas arising in CT, <b>the</b> pediatric <b>GIST,</b> and <b>the</b> multifocal gastric <b>GIST</b> from <b>the</b> 63 -year-old showed negative SDHB staining. <b>GISTs</b> from <b>the</b> 7 young adults and 3 with neurofibromatosis were SDHB positive. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> unselected <b>GISTs,</b> 101 (97 %) were positive. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> negative <b>GISTs</b> arose in a 48 -year-old female with previous recurrent multifocal gastric <b>GISTs</b> and <b>the</b> other 2 arose in females also in their 40 s with gastric GISTs with epithelioid morphology. We conclude that negative staining for SDHB is characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GISTs</b> <b>of</b> CT and <b>the</b> subgroup <b>of</b> pediatric <b>GISTs</b> which it resembles. Furthermore, when negative staining occurs in apparently sporadic <b>GISTs</b> in adults, <b>the</b> <b>GISTs</b> show morphologic and clinical features similar to pediatric and CT type GISTs. GISTs may therefore be divided into type 1 (SDHB positive) and type 2 (SDHB negative) subtypes...|$|R

25|$|In December 2007, EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson {{approved}} {{a draft of}} a document that declared that climate change imperiled the public welfare—a decision that would trigger the first national mandatory global-warming regulations.

White House aides—who had long resisted mandatory regulations {{as a way to}} address climate change—knew <b>the</b> <b>gist</b> <b>of</b> what Johnson's finding would be, Burnett said. They also knew that once they opened the attachment, it would become a public record, making it controversial and difficult to rescind. So they did not open it; rather, they called Johnson and asked him to take back the draft. Johnson rescinded the draft; in July 2008, he issued a new version which did not state that global warming was danger to public welfare. Burnett resigned in protest.|$|E
25|$|Putin {{created the}} United Shipbuilding Corporation in 2007, {{which led to}} the {{recovery}} of shipbuilding in Russia. Since 2006, much efforts were put into consolidation and development of the Rosatom Nuclear Energy State Corporation, {{which led to the}} renewed construction of nuclear power plants in Russia as well as a vast activity of Rosatom abroad, buying huge shares in world's leading uranium production companies and building nuclear power plants in many countries, including India, Iran, China, Vietnam and Belarus. In 2007, the Russian Nanotechnology Corporation was established, aimed to boost the science and technology and high-tech industry in Russia. <b>The</b> <b>gist</b> <b>of</b> the new system is to encourage industry to continually reduce manufacturing expenses and improve resource management. Manufacturer profits are made directly dependent on savings it achieves during the series production of modern weapons.

25|$|Recall {{memory is}} linked with {{instincts}} and mechanisms {{in order to}} remember how an event happened to learn from it or avoid the agitator, connections are made with emotions. For instance, if a speaker is very calm and neutral, the effectiveness of encoding memory is very low and listeners get <b>the</b> <b>gist</b> <b>of</b> what the speaker is discussing. On the other hand, if a speaker is shouting and/or using emotionally driven words, listeners tend to remember key phrases {{and the meaning of}} the speech. This is full access of the fight or flight mechanism all people have functioning in the brain, but based on what triggers this mechanism will lead to better recall of it. People tend to focus their attention on cues that are loud, very soft, or something unusual. This makes the auditory system pick up the differences in regular speaking and meaningful speech, when something significant is spoken in the discussion people home in on the message at that part of the speech but tend to lose {{the other part of the}} discussion. Our brains sense differences in speech and when those differences occur the brain encodes that part of speech into memory and the information can be recalled for future reference.|$|E

500|$|In book II, {{dealing with}} {{dialectic}} and rhetoric, Isidore is heavily indebted to translations from the Greek by Boethius, and in book III he is similarly in debt to Cassiodorus, who provided <b>the</b> <b>gist</b> <b>of</b> Isidore's treatment of arithmetic.

Isidore's view of Roman law in book V is viewed through the lens of the Visigothic compendiary called the [...] Breviary of Alaric, which was based on the Code of Theodosius, which Isidore never saw. Through Isidore's condensed paraphrase a third-hand memory of Roman law passed to the Early Middle Ages. Lactantius is the author most extensively quoted in book XI, concerning man. Books XII, XIII and XIV are largely based on Pliny the Elder's Natural History and Solinus; whilst the lost Prata of Suetonius, which can be partly pieced together from what is quoted in Etymologiae, seems to have inspired the general plan of the work, as well as many of its details.|$|E
