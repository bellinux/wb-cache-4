5|$|Current {{practice}} {{involves a}} celebrity turning {{the lights on}} in mid- to late-November, and they remain lit until 6 January (Twelfth Night). The festivities were postponed in 1963 due to the assassination of John F. Kennedy and in 1989 to fit Kylie Minogue's touring commitments. In 2015, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> switched on earlier, on Sunday 1 November, resulting in an unusual closure of the street to all traffic.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was provided}} to illuminate the new road, but for {{one year after the}} opening <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> kept switched off following objections from river pilots who argued that they would make it hard to distinguish the navigation lights of shipping and the signal lights on the shore. Eventually the electric lights were turned on at a reduced brilliance.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lights</b> <b>were</b> {{banned from}} photographing all of Central America except Guatemala, Ecuador, and Colombia, {{as a safety}} measure against the {{gathering}} of strategic knowledge. They {{took advantage of the}} Peruvian government's allowal to take pictures in the air by capturing the earliest photographs of the Nazca lines. These were unable to distinguish from the surface, though further into the atmosphere the designs can range from simple patterns to hummingbirds and llamas.|$|E
50|$|In 1904 <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{upgraded}} to incandescent gas, In 1933 <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> electrified, and <b>the</b> lighthouse was automated and demanned.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> moved a {{few feet}} south in 1869. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{refurbished}} in 1929. It was turned off during World War II.|$|R
50|$|A {{report from}} 1913 says that <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> unwatched and <b>the</b> keeper's house is empty, though officially {{the station was}} only demanned in 1920. According to records, in 1920 <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> further {{upgraded}} to acetylene gas carbide lamp, the characteristic was changed to a group flashing and <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> automated.|$|R
5|$|There are {{two sets}} of {{lighting}} in the top spires and decoration. The first are the V-shaped lighting inserts in the steel of the building itself. Added later were groups of floodlights that are on mast arms directed back at the building. This allows {{the top of the}} building to be lit in many colors for special occasions. The tube lighting atop the building was added in 1981, although it {{had been part of the}} original design. Until 1998 <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> turned off at 2a.m., but New York Observer columnist Ron Rosenbaum convinced Tishman Speyer to keep the lights on until 6a.m. Since 2015, the Chrysler Building and other city skyscrapers have been part of the Audubon Society's Lights Out program, wherein the building turns off its lights during bird migration seasons.|$|E
5|$|When first {{playing the}} game, the {{scenarios}} for all five heroines and additional smaller scenarios {{are available in}} {{what is called the}} School Life story arc. When the player completes a character's scenario, he or she receives an orb of light. When eight of these lights are obtained, the game's second story arc, called After Story, is made available. One of the lights disappears during School Life, but reappears in After Story. To view the true ending of Clannad, all 13 lights must be obtained. Originally, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> meant to be items that players could use in the game, but since this increased the game's complexity, and detracted from the storyline, the function of the lights was simplified and made less intrusive.|$|E
5|$|Dick Rubin {{handled the}} film's props, {{and set up}} a {{makeshift}} office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have something in their hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of the props were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless earpiece, which Nichols specifically requested {{on the first day of}} shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had forgotten about). The new phaser was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four blinking lights. The prop came with a hefty $4000 price tag; to save money, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> dropped, reducing the size of the phaser by a third. A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, with the provision that it look far different from the watch Dick Tracy had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of the props were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future man-made materials would be used almost exclusively.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} a {{complete}} <b>light</b> characteristic <b>is</b> [...] "Gp Oc(3) W 10s 15m 10M". This indicates that <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> a group occulting light in which {{a group of three}} eclipses repeat every 10 seconds; <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> white; <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> 15 metres above the chart datum and is visible for 10 nmi km.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second example}} {{can be read}} [...] "If both switch A and switch B <b>are</b> closed, then <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on. Therefore, it is either true that if switch A <b>is</b> closed, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on, or that if switch B <b>is</b> closed, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on." [...] Here, the most likely natural-language {{interpretation}} of the [...] "if ... then ..." [...] statements would be [...] "whenever switch A <b>is</b> closed, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on", and [...] "whenever switch B <b>is</b> closed, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on". Again, under this interpretation both clauses of the conclusion may be false (for instance in a series circuit, with a light that only comes on when both switches are closed).|$|R

5|$|Police {{raids on}} gay bars were frequent—occurring on average {{once a month}} for each bar. Many bars kept extra liquor in a secret panel behind the bar, or in a car down the block, to {{facilitate}} resuming business {{as quickly as possible}} if alcohol was seized. Bar management usually knew about raids beforehand due to police tip-offs, and raids occurred early enough in the evening that business could commence after the police had finished. During a typical raid, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> turned on, and customers were lined up and their identification cards checked. Those without identification or dressed in full drag were arrested; others were allowed to leave. Some of the men, including those in drag, used their draft cards as identification. Women were required to wear three pieces of feminine clothing, and would be arrested if found not wearing them. Employees and management of the bars were also typically arrested. The period immediately before June 28, 1969, was marked by frequent raids of local bars—including a raid at the Stonewall Inn on the Tuesday before the riots—and the closing of the Checkerboard, the Tele-Star, and two other clubs in Greenwich Village.|$|E
5|$|The {{last week}} of {{production}} was fraught with issues. Red gel lights appeared orange upon reviewing the daily footage; <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> faulty, and three people were nearly electrocuted. On January 26, 1979, the film finally wrapped after 125 days. The three leads (Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley) delivered their final lines at 4:50 pm. Before the crew could go home, a final shot had to be filmed — the climactic fusing of Decker and V'Ger. The script prescribed a heavy emphasis on lighting, with spiraling and blinding white lights. Collins was covered in tiny dabs of cotton glued to his jacket; these highlights were designed to create a body halo. Helicopter lights, 4000–watt lamps and wind machines were used to create the effect of Decker's fusion with the living machine. The first attempts at filming the scene became a nightmare for the crew. The extreme lighting caused normally invisible dust particles {{in the air to}} be illuminated, creating the appearance that the actors were caught in a blizzard. During the retakes throughout the week the crew mopped and dusted the set constantly, and it required later technical work to completely eliminate the dust in the final print.|$|E
5|$|The line {{score is}} {{displayed}} on the guitar's neck, while the ball/strike/out count, the batter's uniform number, and the hit/error indicator are all situated on the headstock. Six small advertising signs represent the tuning keys. The body of the guitar currently features only an LED display board for displaying messages. Initially, the scoreboard featured two matrix message boards: a low-resolution RGB color board on the left which featured advertising and animations, and a white-light monochromatic board on the right, which primarily featured statistical information and other text-based messages. The monochrome board was replaced by an orange-tinted LED display board in 2009 which served both purposes, while the color board was deactivated and covered with advertising signage. The Greer Stadium scoreboard has never {{had the ability to}} display video or any kind of high-resolution images. Between the two boards are an analog clock and a current temperature display. As of 2014, the temperature display is no longer active. Around the boards are four large spaces for advertising; the two on top are static, and the two on bottom rotate between three images each (the rotating spaces have been covered with static signage since 2009). High-tension nets cover the electronic sections to protect them from home run balls. Above the board is a circular advertising space. This space originally displayed the team's guitar-swinger logo, and at times has displayed other Sounds logos. Originally, when a home run was hit, the guitar-swinger logo would light up and perimeter lights around the entire scoreboard would begin flashing; it was also capable of shooting fireworks after each Sounds home run. By the mid-2000s, the scoreboard had fallen into a state of disrepair and obsolescence, and was only marginally functional. Many of <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> no longer able to be lit, and replacement parts were becoming hard to find. When MFP Baseball purchased the team in late 2008, the organization made minor renovations to the scoreboard, rendering it once again fully functional, although not to its original specifications. It was also repainted black, red, yellow, and white over its original red, white, and blue color scheme to reflect the team's present colors.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 1871. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{one of a}} group of New England lighthouses built to the same plan after an award-winning design by a Vermont architect. Nearly identical <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> constructed at Sabin Point, Rose Island, and Colchester Reef. It was deactivated in 1974, but relighted on July 30, 2006. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> added to <b>the</b> National Register of Historic Places as Pomham Rocks Light Station on July 9, 1979. In <b>the</b> 1970s <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> sold to <b>The</b> American Lighthouse Foundation, and is today managed by the Friends of Pomham Rocks Lighthouse.|$|R

25|$|In April 2015, {{planning}} permission was granted to erect six permanent 55-metre floodlights around the ground. Within weeks, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> in action as Durham Jets hosted the Yorkshire Vikings in a T20 Blast match.|$|E
25|$|On June 20, 1930, {{the first}} night game in Texas League history was played at Katy Park in Waco. <b>The</b> <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> donated by Waco {{resident}} Charles Redding Turner, who owned a local farm team for recruits to the Chicago Cubs.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> {{extremely}} popular in both in Arkansas {{and around the}} world, as news crews often visited to film the display. Since their house was located {{on one of the}} busiest streets in Little Rock, it eventually caused severe traffic issues, and lots of complaints.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> {{badly damaged}} during Hurricane Sandy. The {{non-profit}} {{that has taken}} over stewardship of <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> <b>is</b> working with FEMA and private donors to save this national landmark.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{automated}} in 1978, {{which ended}} 68 {{years of service}} by light keepers. In 1985, the Fresnel lens <b>was</b> replaced when <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> powered by solar energy.|$|R
50|$|Constructed in 1864 from cast iron, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> first lit on 1 January 1865. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> first {{automated}} in 1925 {{and used}} an acetylene burning revolving light. Keepers returned to <b>the</b> <b>light</b> in 1947 and it remained manned until 1984 when <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> fully automated. <b>The</b> <b>light's</b> last keeper, Ray Walter, {{remained on the}} island working with his wife Barbara as Department of Conservation rangers until their retirement in 2006.|$|R
25|$|Genesis {{was later}} to order 55 Vari-lites {{to use in}} their next chain of gigs across the UK. <b>The</b> <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> {{supplied}} with a Vari-Lite console which had 32 channels, five 1802 processors and a dramatic improvement of the first console which was very simple and had an external processing unit.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} after the Battle of Fredericksburg, an aurora was seen from the battlefield. The Confederate Army took this {{as a sign that}} God was on their side, as <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> rarely seen so far south. The {{painting}} Aurora Borealis by Frederic Edwin Church is widely interpreted to represent the conflict of the American Civil War.|$|E
25|$|Except {{in times}} of danger, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> to be placed outside one's door, on the {{opposite}} side of the mezuza, or in the window closest to the street. Rashi, in a note to Shabbat 21b, says their purpose is to publicize the miracle. The blessings for Hanukkah lights are discussed in tractate Succah, p.46a.|$|E

25|$|The {{site and}} <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>are</b> {{operated}} by <b>the</b> Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The island is accessible by boat, but both {{the site and}} <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>are</b> closed to <b>the</b> public.|$|R
50|$|In 1995 <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{replaced}} with a solar powered lantern which was attached outside the previous lantern room. In early 2003 it was deemed unnecessary and <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> shut down.|$|R
25|$|The scene late in {{the film}} where Grier, Lawrence, and Murphy hug {{in front of the}} Empire State Building was shot around one or two o'clock in the morning, when the lights are usually shut off. If the filmmakers had them shut off at their command, it would have cost them $40–$60,000, so instead Hudlin had the three hug, and <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> {{eventually}} shut off as usual. When editing the film, they simply reversed the footage to make it appear as if <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> being turned on. The filmmakers even thought about ending the movie at this point, deciding instead to go with Marcus attempting to win back Angela's affection. For this, an alternate ending was shot where Angela is teaching the kids at the school and Marcus comes, talks to her and eventually wins her back; the filmmakers thought it was slow and uninteresting, and eventually came up with the released version.|$|E
25|$|Hidden {{headlamps}} (also {{known as}} pop-up lights) {{were introduced in}} 1936, on the Cord 810/812. They were mounted in the front fenders, which were smooth until <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> cranked out - {{each with its own}} small dash-mounted crank - by the operator. They aided aerodynamics when the headlamps were not in use, and were among the Cord's signature design features.|$|E
25|$|LED lamps {{are used}} for {{flashing}} beacon lights on vehicles such as maintenance trucks. Previously, traditional light sources required the engine to continue running {{to ensure that the}} battery would not become depleted if <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> to be used {{for more than a few}} hours. The energy-efficient nature of the LED source allows the engine to remain turned off but the light to continue to flash.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{upgraded}} in 1923 and {{was converted}} from kerosene to acetylene gas. Electricity {{was introduced in}} 1966 and <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> kept manned for many years despite automation in 1987.|$|R
