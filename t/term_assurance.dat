50|$|Term life {{insurance}} or <b>term</b> <b>assurance</b> is {{life insurance}} that provides coverage {{at a fixed}} rate of payments for a limited period of time, the relevant term. After that period expires, coverage at the previous rate of premiums is no longer guaranteed and the client must either forgo coverage or potentially obtain further coverage with different payments or conditions. If the life insured dies during the term, the death benefit will {{be paid to the}} beneficiary. Term insurance is typically the least expensive way to purchase a substantial death benefit on a coverage amount per premium dollar basis over a specific period of time.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on the {{calibration}} of affine stochastic mortality models using <b>term</b> <b>assurance</b> premiums. We view <b>term</b> <b>assurance</b> contracts as a "swap" in which policyholders exchange cash flows (premiums vs. benefits) with an insurer analogous to a generic interest rate swap or credit default swap. Using a simple bootstrapping procedure, we derive the term structure of mortality rates from a stream of contract quotes with different maturities. This term structure is used to calibrate the parameters of affine stochastic mortality models where the survival probability is expressed in closed form. The Vasicek, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross, and jump-extended Vasicek models are considered for fitting the survival probabilities term structure.

40|$|The {{underlying}} stochastic {{nature of}} the requirements for the Solvency II regulations has introduced significant challenges if the required calculations are to be performed correctly, without resorting to excessive approximations, within practical timescales. It is generally acknowledged by practising actuaries within UK life offices that it is currently impossible to correctly fulfil the requirements imposed by Solvency II using existing computational techniques based on commercially available valuation packages. Our work has already shown {{that it is possible}} to perform profitability calculations at a far higher rate than is achievable using commercial packages. One of the key factors in achieving these gains is to calculate reserves using recurrence relations that scale linearly with the number of time steps. Here, we present a general vector recurrence relation which can be used for a wide range of non-unit linked policies that are covered by Solvency II; such contracts include annuities, <b>term</b> <b>assurances,</b> and endowments.

40|$|There is endless {{story about}} the {{important}} of housing for human being. Not just one of basic need for human kind, but it provides additional life style value to them. Most of housing practices in Malaysia may classified into four periods that reflect to housing budget needs during renting a room or during renting a house, during buying a house and during living after payment of mortgage loan has been completed. In Malaysia, peoples buy houses through mortgage loans which protected by Mortgage Reducing <b>Term</b> <b>Assurance</b> (MRTA). The buyers with such insurance coverage will benefits from risk of losing the house especially if they die later. This helps their beneficiaries maintain their standard of 	 living in term of housing needs. But, other sad story heard from people who currently renting a house.

40|$|Purpose. Profit and {{profitability}} of any, including transport enterprises {{are the main}} economic indicators of the enterprise effectiveness. These indicators reflect the results and successful performance of the enterprise. On the other hand the enterprise effectiveness in the long <b>term,</b> <b>assurance</b> of rapid development and competitiveness is largely determined by the level of investment activity {{and the range of}} investment activity. The {{purpose of this study is}} the feasibility of the method to determine optimal investments volume for improving these or others (selectable by the management) principal economic indicators of the enterprise effectiveness. Methodology. The basis of the proposed methodology for determining the optimal investments volume is the theory of optimal control, in particular, the procedure of dynamic programming since a managed development process of the enterprise is a multiple stage. This procedure, using a phased plan, allows not only simplifying the solution of optimization problems, but also solving those, which are impossible to apply the methods of mathematical analysis. Findings. The expediency of performing the calculations to determine the optimal investments volume to ensure high rates of enterprise development was proved, it is a key to the effectiveness of the enterprise in the long term and it improves its competitiveness. Originality. It is shown that using methods of the optimum control theory one can calculate the minimum volume of capital investments for the improvement of economic indicators, which determine the enterprise effectiveness. The proposed method of calculation does not depend on the specific content of economic indicators. The effectiveness of this calculation method is demonstrated on a model example. Practical value. The proposed method of calculating the minimum volume of capital investments to improve the economic effectiveness of enterprises is quite simple, but at the same time enables, on the one hand, to determine priority directions of investment activity of the enterprise. On the other hand it improves the manageability and transparency of business enterprises, increases the head's confidence in the correctness of decisions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Krechba {{field is}} one of several gas fields located in the Algerian Sahara desert, and was set in {{operation}} in August 2004 as part of a joint venture with BP, Sonatrach and StatoilHydro. The natural gas in the fields contains up to 10 % CO 2, which has to be reduced to 0. 3 % before the gas is sold, resulting in the production of around 1 million tonnes/year CO 2. Rather than vent the CO 2 to the atmosphere (business as usual), it is re-injected into the water leg of the Krechba Carboniferous Sandstone gas producing reservoir (20  m thick) via three horizontal wells at a depth of around 1, 900 metres. CO 2 injection started in August 2004 and to date nearly 2. 5 million tonnes of CO 2 have been injected, amounting to approximately 25 % of the gas extracted from the Krechba field over the same period. A number of key technologies to monitor the injection, and the subsurface movement and storage of CO 2 have been, and will continue to be, deployed to provide long <b>term</b> <b>assurance</b> of sequestration. Time lapse satellite images (using PSInSARTM Technology) which measure ground deformation to assess the movement of CO 2 in the subsurface have proven to be much more successful than initially thought, despite the depth of injection and the low voidage replacement rate (25 %). Satellite images collected since start of injection show clear increases in ground elevation of up to 30 mm around the three injectors while subsidence is also apparent in the area of maximum gas production. The images have also confirmed the CO 2 is moving in the direction of preferred fracture orientation at reservoir level. Recent downhole pressure measurements in one of the injectors also indicates that the CO 2 is being contained within the injection horizon. Work is ongoing to integrate the satellite images with geomechanical and seismic data to better understand how these images can be used for monitoring of CO 2 movement in the subsurface. A key part of the forward monitoring programme will be the acquistion of time-lapse 3 D seismic, deployment of tiltmeters and GPS to confirm and calibrate the satellite imagery data, microseismic detectors in shallow boreholes to assess the degree of rock strain and use of shallow wells to monitor the water chemistry in the vadose zone. These will supplement the ongoing tracer, wellhead sampling and satellite imagery data acquistion. This paper shares the latest results of the ongoing CO 2 monitoring project...|$|E
40|$|The Human Genetics Commission {{intends to}} study the use of family history in underwriting, {{regarding}} it as genetic information in a broad sense. We survey the developments in genetics and insurance {{that led up to}} this decision. We propose a model for studying the possible costs of adverse selection in the mortgage-related life insurance market (which is important in the United Kingdom) with and without moratoria on the use of family history. We consider both level and decreasing <b>term</b> <b>assurances,</b> finding that the cost of adverse selection is slightly higher for the latter. Several assumptions about mutation penetrance, incidence of additional mortality, prevalence of genetic testing and insurance-buying behaviour are considered. Overall we conclude that: (a) a moratorium on genetic test results alone will lead to negligible adverse selection costs; while (b) a moratorium extended to family history will lead to premium increases just by redefining underwriting classes, with adverse selection being possible as well, but only in extreme circumstances would all premium increases be likely to exceed about 10 %. However, we give examples in a model of a smaller life insurance market that show that our benign conclusions might not apply more generally...|$|R
