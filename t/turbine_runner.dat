2500|$|From January to March 2009, turbine2 was {{undergoing}} scheduled repairs and modernization. It {{was the first}} and only turbine in the station which was equipped with a new electro-hydraulic regulator of its rotational speed supplied by the Promavtomatika company. [...] During the course of the repair, the turbine blades were welded, because after a long period of operation, cracks and cavities had once again appeared. The <b>turbine</b> <b>runner</b> was not properly rebalanced after these repairs, following which turbine2 had increased vibrations, ca [...] for the main bearing during the full load of the turbine. While this did not exceed specifications, the increased vibrations were unacceptable for long term use. The elevated vibration levels compared to other turbines were apparent for turbine 2 before the repair as well. The vibrations exceeded the allowed specification in the beginning of July and continued to increase with accelerated speed.|$|E

The New York Power Authority {{is involved in the}} rehabilitation of large hydropower units, such as those at the St. Lawrence-FDR Power Project. Recent progress in numerical simulation software allows these units to reach a high level of performance in order to improve productivity and reliability. For phase 2 of the rehabilitation project, eight new replacement propeller runners are to be supplied by Alstom Hydro — a company that develops power generation products and systems — for the original Allis-Chalmers <b>turbines.</b> These <b>runners</b> are 6. 096 meters in diameter, have an expected lifespan of 70 years and are capable of producing 64. 9 MW under 24. 7 meters net head. The hub and blades of the runner are castings of stainless steel machined to final shape. Dynamic loads that occur during the life of hydraulic <b>turbine</b> <b>runners</b> can cause failure and, therefore, present a significant risk with regard to the reliability of the turbine as well as the economic viability of the project. Because of this, technical specifications now require dynamic load analyses of <b>turbine</b> <b>runners.</b> A fracture mechanics analysis is used to evaluate crack growth rates for flaws and to predict the mechanical failure of the component over a given lifespan.

40|$|New <b>turbine</b> <b>runners</b> {{designed}} for safer fish passage will {{be installed in}} Units 1, 2 and 3 at Ice Harbor Lock and Dam. Installation of the new runners will begin in 2015 with completion anticipated in 2018. Unit 2 will receive a fixed blade runner and {{will be the first}} installed. Unit 1 and Unit 3 will receive identical adjustable blade (Kaplan) runners. Installation of Unit 2 will be complete in early 2016; Units 3 and 1 will be complete in 2017 and 2018 respectively. These new <b>turbine</b> <b>runners</b> are designed to reduce risk of injury to juvenile fish caused by mechanisms such as blade strike and shear, as well as pressure injuries known as barotrauma. Extensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and physical hydraulic modeling efforts have focused on achieving good hydraulic conditions with minimum pressures of 83 kPa to 103 kPa. Maintaining nadir pressures ≥ 83 kPa will greatly reduce risk of pressure related injury and mortality experienced by turbine passed juvenile salmonids. Once installed the new <b>turbine</b> <b>runners</b> require a biological evaluation to establish the biological performance and to validate the design process and criteria. The biological study design should produce precise, accurate survival estimates with the least associated bias possible. A combination of balloon tag and acoustic telemetry study methods will provide turbine survival estimates encompassing both direct and indirect effects of turbine passage. These study methods have been Regionally accepted and used to establish the most recent estimates of turbine passage survival at the lower Snake and Columbia River dams. Turbine pressure and acceleration data will be collected. These data will be used correlate conditions fish experience as they pass through the turbines with injury and mortality. These data provide evidence of blade strike, shear, and pressure and will also be used to determine how well the new turbine designs meet the biological criteria, and for comparison with and validation of CFD model results. Pertinent factors are discussed for consideration in choosing and implementing each study design. Statistical analysis methods and preliminary sample sizes associated with these study designs are presented, as well as design assumptions and biases, project operations, and sample season considerations.

After years of heavy vibration and a poorly matched turbine design, one of the blades catastrophically failed in February 2009, causing an immediate shutdown of the plant. The sheared off blade, weighing , was later recovered from the river. The <b>turbine</b> <b>runner</b> was repaired in 2010 by welding the old blade back in place.

40|$|AbstractThe {{reliability}} assessment of large rotating structures like hydroelectric Francis runners is often limited by {{our capacity to}} define a proper limit state combined with a relevant degradation model. In this paper, we propose that the proper limit state for fatigue reliability of such structures is the onset of high cycle fatigue (HCF). Based on this premise, a prior interval for our limit state based on available literature is presented. The prior assumptions {{are believed to be}} the first step toward validation of the applicability and suitability of the proposed model.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{turbulent}} flow in water turbines, {{focusing on the}} flow {{in the vicinity of}} reaction water <b>turbine</b> <b>runners</b> such as the Kaplan runner and the Francis runner. The method of investigation is principally numerical although some experimental observations and measurements made in the present work and elsewhere are included. A major part of the present work was to implement an efficient and general CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) code that could resolve the complicated geometry of a water turbine. A parallel multiblock finite volume CFD code, CALC-PMB (Parallel MultiBlock), was developed. The main features of the code are the use of conformal block structured boundary fitted coordinates, a pressure correction scheme (SIMPLEC), Cartesian velocity components as the principal unknowns and a collocated grid arrangement together with Rhie and Chow interpolation. The turbulence is modeled using a low-Reynolds k-omega turbulence model. The parallel multiblock algorithm employs two ghost cell planes at the block interfaces. The message passing at the interfaces is done using either PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) or MPI (Message Passing Interface). Three water <b>turbine</b> <b>runners</b> are used for the investigations, two Kaplan runners and one Francis runner. One of the Kaplan runners was used during the development of the CFD code. This runner could not be used to validate the CFD code but the work on this runner still gave valuable insights on CFD in water turbines. The other Kaplan runner is a model of the runners installed in the H¨olleforsen power plant in Indals¨alven in Sweden. The computational results of the H¨olleforsen wicket gate and runner flow are validated against the thorough experimental investigations from the Turbine 99 workshops and additional LDV (Laser Doppler Velocimetry) measurements made in the present work. The Francis runner model investigated here was used as a test case at a GAMM workshop in 1989. The present computational results of the GAMM Francis runner are validated against measurements at both the best efficiency operating condition and four off-design operating conditions. Several important flow features are visualized to make comparisons with experimental observations and to better understand the flow in water <b>turbine</b> <b>runners.</b> The validations against both detailed measurements and experimental observations show that the flow is captured qualitatively correctly. A method for numerical verification of the computational results has been derived and applied to the computational results of the present work. The method is based on the conservation of a sub-set of the angular momentum equations that is particularly important to swirling flow in water turbines. The method is {{based on the fact that}} the discretized angular momentum equations are not necessarily conserved when the discretized linear momentum equations are solved. The method shows that the first-order hybrid discretization scheme cannot be used and that the second-order Van Leer discretization scheme needs improvement to give quantitatively correct results in these kinds of applications...|$|R
