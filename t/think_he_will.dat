25|$|John Bonham {{played the}} drums {{like someone who}} didn't {{know what was going}} to happen next—like he was teetering on the edge of a cliff. No one has come close to that since, and I don't think anybody ever will. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> forever be the {{greatest}} drummer of all time.|$|E
25|$|This {{country has}} been good to me. It gave me {{everything}} I have. I have never come out for any candidate before but I think Wendell L. Willkie {{will give us a}} square deal. So I am for Willkie because I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> help my people, and I figure my people should be for him, too.|$|E
25|$|The book {{begins by}} {{describing}} the four main characters – Munira, Karega, Wanja, and Abdulla – {{just after the}} revelation that three prominent Kenyans, two businessmen and one educator, {{have been killed in}} a fire. The next chapter moves back in the novel's timeline, focusing on Munira's move to Ilmorog, to begin work as a teacher. He is initially met with suspicion and poor classroom attendance, as the villagers <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> give up on the village soon, {{in much the same way}} previous teachers have done. However, Munira stays and, with the friendship of Abdulla, another immigrant to Ilmorog who owns a small shop and bar, carves out a life as a teacher.|$|E

25|$|Silvio and Patsy rush {{to pack up}} {{important}} {{items from}} the Bing. They are intercepted by two Lupertazzi hit men, Ray-Ray and Petey B, and fired upon. Silvio is hit multiple times while Patsy abandons the car and flees while returning fire. Silvio is left in a medically-induced coma, from which doctors do not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> awaken. Tony arrives back home and, hearing about the hits, orders his family to go into hiding. Carmela and Meadow visit the Baccalieris, who are all in shock over Bobby's death. At nightfall, Tony, Paulie, Carlo, and Dante Greco drive to an old suburban safe house. Tony goes upstairs to get some sleep, clutching the AR-10 assault rifle that Bobby gave him for his birthday.|$|E
500|$|In 1934, Kanō stopped giving public exhibitions. The {{reason was}} his failing health, {{probably}} compounded by kidney stones. The British judoka Sarah Mayer [...] wrote [...] "People don’t seem to <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> live much longer" [...] {{to her friends}} in London. Nevertheless, Kanō continued attending important Kodokan events such as kagami-biraki (New Years' ceremonies) whenever he could, and he continued participating in Olympics business.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the series, Bobrov {{held a press}} luncheon in Moscow. He {{refused to}} {{consider}} that either team would sweep the series. To him, Team Canada had [...] "the fire power, know-how and goaltending", but how would it adapt to international rules, two-referee system and amateur officials? He conceded that Phil Esposito would [...] "be difficult {{to move from the}} front of the net. I expect there will be some surprises for us when we meet your Canadian stars." [...] He also predicted that Valeri Kharlamov [...] "will stand out, even against your best Canadians. By North American standards, he is small but he has an excellent shot. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be effective." [...] Sinden was aware of Kharlamov and he selected Ron Ellis to the Team Canada roster especially to cover Kharlamov.|$|E

2500|$|Early in his pro career, Mayweather {{received}} {{praise from}} {{all corners of}} the boxing world and was touted as a pugilistic prodigy. During his fight with Tony Duran the ESPN commentator remarked, [...] "Emmanuel Steward was quoted as saying there have been very few who have been more talented than this kid. He will probably win two or three world championships; I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> go on to be the best ever". IBHOF trainer and commentator Gil Clancy commented before Mayweather's ninth professional fight (against Jesus Chavez), [...] "I thought that Floyd Mayweather was the outstanding pro prospect in the entire Olympic games".|$|E
2500|$|On 8 May 2006, the Financial Times {{reported}} that Murdoch would be hosting {{a fund-raiser for}} Senator Hillary Clinton's (D-New York) Senate re-election campaign. In a 2008 interview with Walt Mossberg, Murdoch was asked whether he had [...] "anything {{to do with the}} New York Posts endorsement of Barack Obama in the democratic primaries." [...] Without hesitating, Murdoch replied, [...] "Yeah. He is a rock star. It's fantastic. I love what he is saying about education. I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> win Florida... but he will win in Ohio and the election. I am anxious to meet him. I want to see if he will walk the walk." [...] Murdoch is a strong supporter of Israel and its domestic policies.|$|E
2500|$|Upon his {{exit from}} the Senate {{at the end of}} 1996, Nunn was the {{recipient}} of bipartisan praise from his colleagues. Republican Senator John Warner of Virginia concluded, [...] "Senator Nunn quickly established himself as one of the leading experts in the Congress and, indeed, all of the United States on national security and foreign policy. He gained a reputation in our country and, indeed, worldwide as a global thinker, and that is where I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> make his greatest contribution in the years to come, wherever he may be, in terms of being a global thinker. His approach to national security issues has been guided by one fundamental criteria: What Sam Nunn believes {{is in the best interest}} of the United States of America." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He sees a {{beautiful}} face and <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> never forget it, {{but in a}} few weeks the feeling passes off, and he wonders how he could have cared for anybody so absurdly much.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say 'father.' We {{never called}} him papa; {{and if one}} of my {{brothers}} had addressed him as 'governor,' as boys do now, I really <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>'d</b> have him cut off with a shilling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear, sorrowful little people, I {{bring you}} glad tidings of great joy," [...] she said. [...] "The doctor {{has just been}} here, and he finds Peter much better, and <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> pull through after all." ...|$|R
2500|$|Melman {{and other}} critics {{of the book and}} the film have said that the story's premise—that Israeli agents had second {{thoughts}} about their work—is not supported by interviews or public statements. In an interview with Reuters, a retired head of Israel's Shin Bet intelligence service and [...] former Internal Security Minister, Avi Dichter, likened Munich to a children's adventure story: [...] "There is no comparison between {{what you see in the}} movie and how it works in reality". [...] In a Time magazine cover story about the film on December 4, 2005, Spielberg said that the source of the film had second thoughts about his actions. [...] "There is something about killing people at close range that is excruciating," [...] Spielberg said. [...] "It's bound to try a man's soul." [...] Of the real Avner, Spielberg says, [...] "I don’t <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> ever find peace." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wallace's reaction, {{delivered}} in January 1859, {{was that he}} was gratified to have spurred Darwin into making the announcement and that it would have caused him [...] "much pain & regret" [...] if his papers had been published on their own, without Darwin's papers. [...] Darwin was still sensitive on the point, and assured Wallace that he [...] "had absolutely nothing whatever to do with leading Lyell and Hooker to what they thought was a fair course of action". He responded to Wallace's enquiry about what Lyell thought of the theory by saying that [...] "I think he is somewhat staggered, but does not give in and speaks with horror [...] what a job it would be for the next edition of [...] "The Principles" [...] if he were [...] "perverted". But he is most candid and honest, and I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> end up by being [...] "perverted"." [...] Lyell was still struggling {{to come to terms with}} the idea of mankind, with immortal soul, originating from animals, but [...] "Considering his age, his former views and position in society, I think his conduct has been heroic on the subject." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cao Cao admired Guan Yu's character, {{but he also}} {{sensed that}} Guan had no {{intention}} of serving under him for long. He told Zhang Liao, [...] "Why don't you make use of your friendship with Guan Yu to find out his objective?" [...] When Zhang Liao asked Guan Yu, the latter replied, [...] "I'm aware that Lord Cao treats me very generously. However, I've also received many favours from General Liu and I've sworn to follow him until I die. I cannot break my oath. I'll leave eventually, so you should help me convey my message to Lord Cao." [...] Zhang Liao did so, and Cao Cao was further impressed with Guan Yu. The Fu Zi gave a slightly different account of this incident. It stated that Zhang Liao had a dilemma on whether to convey Guan Yu's message to Cao Cao or not: if he did, Cao Cao might execute Guan Yu; if he did not, he would be failing in his service to Cao Cao. He sighed, [...] "Lord Cao is my superior and is like a father to me; Guan Yu is like a brother to me." [...] He eventually made his decision to tell Cao Cao. Cao Cao said, [...] "A subject who serves a lord but does not forget his origins is truly a man of righteousness. When do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> leave?" [...] Zhang Liao replied, [...] "Guan Yu has received favours from Your Excellency. He'll most probably leave after he has repaid your kindness." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The fever {{has quite}} left him," [...] he said; [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> do now. It will be slow, very slow, but I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> regain his strength; {{as to his}} mind, of that I can say nothing at present." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} about the lawsuit? I don't care for that! Do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> hate {{me when he}} sees me?

6000|$|... 1. If Jesus Christ {{should allow}} thee once to <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> cast thee out, he must allow thee to <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> falsify his word; for he hath said, [...] "I will in no wise cast out." [...] But Christ would not that thou shouldst count {{him as one}} that will falsify his word; for he saith of himself, [...] "I am the truth;" [...] {{therefore}} he would not that any that in truth are coming to him, should once <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> cast them out.|$|R
6000|$|... "I told Tippy Tilly that, if {{he could}} help us, we would turn him into a Bimbashi when we got him back into Egypt. I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>willing</b> enough if <b>he</b> only had the power. By Jove, Belmont, do {{look back at the}} river." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 5. If Jesus Christ {{should allow}} those that indeed {{are coming to}} him, once to <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> cast them out, he must allow them to <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be unfaithful to the trust and charge that his Father hath {{committed}} to him; which is to save, and not to lose anything of that which he hath given unto him to save (John 6:39). But the Father hath given him a charge to save the coming sinner; therefore it cannot be, that he should allow, that such an one should once <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> cast him out.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> come by train," [...] she replied. [...] "He will jog back--as Magdalen flippantly {{expressed}} it--in the miller's gig." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{parish priest}} {{calls on the}} local landowner, the Marquis de Chavanes, to say that Jean-Pierre Bacadou, a republican, has {{attended}} Mass, an unheard-of event.
