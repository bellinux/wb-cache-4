5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{names for}} crow or raven species include very {{possibly}} gbgb/gbg3; this bird is once called 3pd km or 'black bird', while its eggs could apparently be gathered according <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> papyrus, and therefore {{points to a}} breeding bird of Egypt. In demotic an ʾbḳ-bird can be determined by help {{of the existence of}} Coptic abook 'Crow, raven'. But perhaps the latter is also a derivatiuon of the bird name kbk.|$|E
5|$|Beyoncé {{has worked}} with Pepsi since 2002, and in 2004 {{appeared}} in a Gladiator-themed commercial with Britney Spears, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias. In 2012, Beyoncé signed a $50million deal to endorse Pepsi. The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPINET) wrote Beyoncé an open letter asking her to reconsider the deal because of the unhealthiness of the product and to donate the proceeds <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> organisation. Nevertheless, NetBase found that Beyoncé's campaign was the most talked about endorsement in April 2013, with a 70 per cent positive audience response to the commercial and print ads.|$|E

5|$|Bound for Glory was {{scheduled}} to feature nine professional wrestling matches and one pre-show match, however, due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> emergency TNA was forced to change the main event of the show, resulting in ten overall matches. Each of these matches involved wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines portraying villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters; these scripted events built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.|$|E
5|$|In {{parts of}} the world which lack a high level of infrastructure, {{ambulances}} are designed to meet local conditions, being built using intermediate technology. Ambulances can also be trailers, which are pulled by bicycles, motorcycles, tractors, or animals. Animal-powered ambulances can be particularly useful in regions that are subject to flooding. Motorcycles fitted with sidecars (or motorcycle ambulances) are also used, though they are subject to some of the same limitations as more traditional over-the-road ambulances. The level of care provided by these ambulances varies between merely providing transport <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> clinic to providing on-scene and continuing care during transport.|$|E
5|$|In several seasons, contestants {{have been}} cast but {{ultimately}} withdrew {{before the game}} began: a 20th contestant, Mellisa McNulty was originally cast in , but dropped out and returned home {{the night before the}} show began because of panic attacks, while in , the 19th and 20th contestants, So and Doo Kim a related couple, were removed just before filming due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> emergency. In both cases, the removed contestants were unreplaced. Fiji and San Juan del Sur proceeded with an uneven gender balance. This occurrence made Fiji the only season {{in the history of the}} show to have an odd number of players.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{his tour}} of duty Nash had been wary of {{preferential}} treatment towards him due to his fame and opposed any attempts to promote him, which he believed he did not deserve.

Following his return to Australia, Nash sold War Bonds and appeared at war-related charity functions, including one where he raised an additional £100 by singing to the large crowd.|$|E

5|$|In 1892 Rimsky-Korsakov {{suffered}} a second creative drought, {{brought on by}} bouts of depression and alarming physical symptoms. Rushes of blood to the head, confusion, memory loss and unpleasant obsessions led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> diagnosis of neurasthenia. Crises in the Rimsky-Korsakov household {{may have been a}} factor—the serious illnesses of his wife and one of his sons from diphtheria in 1890, the deaths of his mother and youngest child, as well as the onset of the prolonged, ultimately fatal illness of his second youngest child. He resigned from the Russian Symphony Concerts and the Court Chapel and considered giving up composition permanently. After making third versions of the musical tableau Sadko and the opera The Maid of Pskov, he closed his musical account with the past; he had left none of his major works before May Night in their original form.|$|E
5|$|In early 1944, Freyberg {{was made}} {{commander}} of the New Zealand Corps, newly formed for the Battle of Monte Cassino, while Kippenberger was promoted to temporary major-general and made {{commander of the}} 2nd Division. This was the pinnacle of his military career. The division had moved into the line around Cassino, replacing the U.S. 36th Infantry Division, which had been attacking the strongly defended German positions. The first attack by the New Zealanders on 17 February was unsuccessful despite {{the bombing of the}} Monte Cassino abbey, which Kippenberger supported. A second attack was planned for 20 February, but it was delayed by bad weather. On 2 March, Kippenberger climbed the slopes of nearby Mount Trocchio to gain an overview of the Cassino battlefield. Near the top of the mountain, he triggered a land mine which exploded and injured both legs to the extent that one foot was severed in the blast. He was evacuated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> centre, and the other foot and the lower portions of both legs were amputated. When the news of his injuries spread to the men of the 2nd New Zealand Division, it was met with some disbelief and shock, greatly affecting morale.|$|E

Per the Alcoholism Treatment and Rehabilitation Act (ATRA), public intoxication without accompanying disorderly behavior is not a criminal offense, and municipalities are prohibited from making ordinances against public intoxication. New Jersey law allows a police officer to take people found to be intoxicated in public to their residence or <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> facility.|$|E

5|$|The story {{centers on}} the {{kidnapping}} of David Tapp by The Jigsaw Killer. During the first Saw film, Tapp witnessed his longtime friend and partner, Detective Steven Sing, fall victim to one of Jigsaw's traps. This left Tapp mentally unstable and he was soon discharged from the police force. Later, Tapp {{was shot in the}} chest by Zep Hindle after chasing him in pursuit of Jigsaw. Jigsaw had Tapp healed and concealed a key in his chest. Tapp was then placed in an abandoned insane asylum. Tapp wakes up in a bathroom with the Reverse Bear Trap on him. He quickly pulls it off and ventures into the rest of the asylum. He is led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> wing by another victim of Jigsaw, only to be betrayed by the man. Tapp learns that he is being hunted by other victims in the asylum who need the key inside his chest to escape their own games. In the medical wing, Jigsaw informs Tapp that there is a woman trapped in the area who needs Tapp's help to survive. He quickly deciphers that it is Amanda Young, whom Tapp interviewed after she survived her first test. He saves Amanda, and she follows Tapp until a mysterious figure called Pighead captures her to fake her escape; she is actually Jigsaw's secret apprentice.|$|E
