25|$|William Hawi {{created a}} “Military Police” {{in charge of}} {{controlling}} the disorder and chaos that were everywhere and introduced a regulatory mechanism to guarantee road safety and guide the citizens to these safe roads. Perhaps the most terrible ordeal he had to face was <b>that</b> <b>famous</b> massacre on December 6, 1975, that was later called the “Black Saturday” where he was also subjected to menaces and humiliation {{when he tried to}} rescue as many innocents as he could. Several persons owe him their lives, their dignity and their properties.|$|E
25|$|He left {{notes on}} {{physical}} {{aspects of the}} human body alongside his ethnographic notes. He introduced a rich terminology on body parts (from head to toes) into the literary language. It should be mentioned that these terms are still used, both in science and everyday speech. He gave, among other things, his own interpretation of the connection between environment and inhabitants, with parts on nourishment, living conditions, hygiene, diseases and funeral customs. All in all this considerable contribution of Vuk Karadžić is not <b>that</b> <b>famous</b> or studied.|$|E

One of these comrades was Lance Corporal Ellis Sifton who won the Victoria Cross that day but lost his life. The tiny box in which his effects were posted to his parents is part of a poignant display in his honour.|$|E
25|$|Juliette Benzoni's {{maiden name}} was Andrée-Marguerite–Juliette Mangin. She was the {{daughter}} of Marie-Susanne Arnold (with Alsace and Swiss Switzerland origin) and Charles-Hubert Mangin. She grew up in an upper-middle-class family in Paris. At the age of nine she discovered in a book Joan of Arc, at the stake and that was the moment her passion for history was awakened. It was her father who persuaded her to read the books of Alexander Dumas as she told 2002 the Magazine Littéraire for the two hundred anniversary of <b>that</b> <b>famous</b> author.|$|E
25|$|In {{one of his}} verses, Cnut's court poet Sigvatr Þórðarson recounts <b>that</b> <b>famous</b> princes {{brought their}} heads to Cnut and bought peace.

It was therefore at some point after this and the consolidation of Norway that Cnut went to Scotland with an army, and the navy in the Irish Sea, in 1031, to receive, without bloodshed, the submission of three Scottish kings: Maelcolm, Maelbeth and Iehmarc. One of these kings, Iehmarc, may be one Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, an Uí Ímair chieftain and the ruler of a sea-kingdom of the Irish Sea, with Galloway among his domains.|$|E

25|$|The most {{conspicuous}} case {{and one which}} {{has given rise to}} long-standing debate is Alba Longa. The location of <b>that</b> <b>famous</b> city, according to tradition founded by Ascanius and the metropolis of the Latins for 418 years, is still a mystery. Some scholars have argued that it has not yet been identified because the Ancients themselves did not know exactly where it was located and the reason for their ignorance was that Alba had never been a real city. It would rather have been a loose collection of small and sparsely populated protohistoric villages organised in the Bronze Age custom around the sanctuary of Mount Albanus and abandoned before it reached the urban stage.|$|E

500|$|The {{new title}} {{immediately}} became successful, {{and demand for}} reprints of old favorites was such that Munsey decided to launch an additional magazine, Fantastic Novels, in July 1940, edited, like Famous Fantastic Mysteries, by Mary Gnaedinger. The two magazines were placed on bimonthly schedules, arranged to alternate with each other, though the schedule slipped slightly with the fifth issue of Fantastic Novels, dated April 1941 but following the January 1941 issue. [...] Fantastic Novels was suspended after that issue and merged with Famous Fantastic Mysteries. [...] The stated reason was <b>that</b> <b>Famous</b> Fantastic Mysteries [...] "is apparently the favorite title", but {{it seems likely that}} production difficulties caused by World War II played a part. [...] The June 1941 and August 1941 issues of Famous Fantastic Mysteries both carried the slogan [...] "Combined with Fantastic Novels Magazine" [...] on the cover.|$|E

500|$|Although {{it would}} still be a month before the term [...] "Army of the Tennessee" [...] came into use, the three {{divisions}} that served under Grant in the Henry-Donelson campaign were the nucleus of <b>that</b> <b>famous</b> army and had now won an important victory that foreshadowed its later successes. [...] One historian describes their accomplishments in the Henry-Donelson campaign as the [...] "first significant Union triumph in the war"; its fruits included breaking the Confederacy's western line of defense, securing Kentucky to the Union, and opening the South, especially Tennessee, to invasion. Another historian notes that Grant's troops [...] "had performed prodigies of valor and endurance during the campaign" [...] and had learned from it that [...] "hard fighting would bring success." [...] As a result of the campaign's conspicuous success, Grant, McClernand, Smith, and Wallace were all promoted to the rank of major general of volunteers. [...] Grant in particular became a national celebrity—"Unconditional Surrender" [...] Grant—for his refusal to allow any other terms of surrender.|$|E
500|$|Becky Bain of Idolator {{commented on}} the simple {{structure}} and themes of the video, writing [...] "There’s not much to this simple vid, but it does feature Carey doing her usual hand waving theatrics while hitting some absolutely killer high notes." [...] Bain also observed {{that the vast majority}} of the shots of Carey are either long shots, showing the singer from a distance, or close up shots, showing Carey from the shoulders and above, so that the viewer was not able to easily recognise that she was pregnant. Nicole James of MTV Buzzworthy also praised the content of the video, writing [...] "Of course it wouldn't be a Mariah Carey video without some glitz and glam so the stage and backdrop are covered in (what else?) glitter. Mariah puts on a great show and sings her heart out with <b>that</b> <b>famous</b> eight-octave range... scrooges need not apply, 'Oh Santa!' is fun and festive and has you longing for a sip of eggnog." ...|$|E
500|$|The main {{theme of}} the novel is drugs, which Faulks said came partly from the {{timeframe}} of the novel and partly from Fleming not using it as a major theme: [...] "1967, the summer of love... Drugs were first coming to public notice. The Stones were busted, and there was <b>that</b> <b>famous</b> leader in The Times. And, you know, {{what are we talking about}} now all the time? Drugs. It's still very resonant. And there's little about drug-dealing in Fleming. It's not something he did in any depth." [...] Faulks also wanted to broaden the aspect of the story compared to Fleming: [...] "The book is set during the Cold War and I wanted it to not just be a crime story but to also have a political background. I was also determined that although the book is set in 1967, I wanted the issues that it touches on to still be alive to us today".|$|E

500|$|Paul Verdon, in {{his history}} of All Black captains, Born to Lead, writes: [...] "The {{overwhelming}} evidence suggests Gallaher's leadership style, honed from {{time spent in the}} Boer War, was very effective." [...] Gallaher's biographer Matt Elliott asserts that in the century since his playing retirement [...] "his reputation as a player and leader have only enhanced". According to historian Terry McLean: [...] "In a long experience of reading and hearing about the man, one has never encountered, from the New Zealand angle, or from his fellow players, criticism of his qualities as a leader." [...] In the view of the English rugby journalist E. H. D. Sewell, writing soon after Gallaher's death, the New Zealand captain was [...] "a very quiet, taciturn sort of cove, who spoke rarely about football or his own achievements... I never heard a soul who met him on <b>that</b> <b>famous</b> trip, say a disparaging word about him." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{other critics}} however, did not react so warmly towards Q's Nikita. Chris Conaton of PopMatters felt that Q [...] "seems to {{be a good}} choice for the title role," [...] but noted that the pilot did not call {{attention}} to the character's background. That said Conaton stated [...] "it's still something of a novelty to build a TV series around an Asian American lead—though plenty of recent ensemble and reality TV shows have featured prominent cast members of Asian descent." [...] Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe felt that Q was [...] "too much of a sad sack," [...] adding [...] "Q doesn't seem able to layer any other emotions over her cold resolve," [...] and compares the character to [...] "a little bit like [...] Debbie Downer." [...] Mary McNamara of The Los Angeles Times believed that while Nikita [...] "provides some sizzle," [...] her emotions [...] "run <b>that</b> <b>famous</b> distance from A to B, as do virtually [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|During the Paris cholera {{outbreak}} of 1832, {{large quantities of}} so-called chloride of lime were used to disinfect the capital. This was not simply modern calcium chloride, but chlorine gas dissolved in lime-water (dilute calcium hydroxide) to form calcium hypochlorite (chlorinated lime). Labarraque's discovery helped to remove the terrible stench of decay from hospitals and dissecting rooms, and by doing so, effectively deodorised the Latin Quarter of Paris. These [...] "putrid miasmas" [...] were thought by many to cause the spread of [...] "contagion" [...] and [...] "infection" [...] – both words used before the germ theory of infection. Chloride of lime was used for destroying odors and [...] "putrid matter". One source claims chloride of lime was used by Dr. John Snow to disinfect water from the cholera-contaminated well that was feeding the Broad Street pump in 1854 London, though three other reputable sources that describe <b>that</b> <b>famous</b> cholera epidemic do not mention the incident. One reference {{makes it clear that}} chloride of lime was used to disinfect the offal and filth in the streets surrounding the Broad Street pump—a common practice in mid-nineteenth century England.|$|E

When the list of songs that was issued by RTÉ, it did in fact include Dustin, who was then tipped as the favourite to win the contest. Dustin's entry, [...] "Irelande Douze Pointe", is a mock entry, making fun of the Eurovision Song Contest, with lyrics such as [...] "Drag acts and bad acts and Terry Wogan's wig". The title of the song also mocks the contest, mimicking the famous phrase from Eurovision [...] "douze points". The song was composed by Darren Smith, Simon Fine and Dustin (aka Johnny Morrison). Dustin was present on stage in a trolley, with Kitty B (Kathleen Burke) and Ann Harrington singing backing vocals, along with three male back-up dancers. The performance began with Dustin being wheeled out {{from the side of}} the stage by a cloaked figure, with the trolley also being cloaked. The cloaks were removed and the performance included a lot of dancing by the back-up dancers, bathed in green, white and orange, the colours of the Republic of Ireland flag.|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack {{was very}} successful, with the critic Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu stating that [...] "Musically, Karnan is of a calibre that few have surpassed" [...] {{and that the}} [...] "Panthulu-Mellisai Mannar [...] combo {{resulted}} in songs that will live on forever". Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu said, [...] "My interest in Karnan (apart from the critic's mandate that I see everything) was primarily the songs", and noted that Sirkazhi Govindarajan's [...] "liquid diction and brass-throated conviction makes today's male singers sound like tentative little boys in a parent's day recital". Meera Srinivasan, another critic from The Hindu praised the film for the [...] "music score and songs by the inimitable Viswanathan-Ramamoorthy duo with Kannadasan's striking lyrics". Malathi Rangarajan said, [...] "The illustrious composing duo of Viswanathan and Ramamurthy has worked magic with music". M. Suganth of The Times of India stated [...] "The songs are one too many (but what songs they are!)". K. N. Vijayan of The New Straits Times said, [...] "Instead of trooping out, the audience sat through the 14 songs composed by the Viswanathan-Ramamoorty pair. They are <b>that</b> <b>famous</b> and many can sing along to the lyrics as the songs have been heard countless times on the radio". Writing for The Hindu, C. V.
