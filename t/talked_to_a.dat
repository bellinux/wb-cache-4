5|$|The Ashaninkas were {{pressured}} to begin growing coca as cocaine trafficking increased in Peru {{by the early}} 1980s. Gagnon {{said that he would}} leave the mission if the people entered the cocaine trade, and no one chose to change their way of life. As the trade grew in the area, though, Gagnon <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> United States Drug Enforcement Administration agent and {{sent a letter to the}} Peruvian security police base commander in Mazamari in 1983. Gagnon was told, and heeded the advice of two drug traffickers, not make any further overtures about the cocaine trade.|$|E

25|$|Immediately after Savile's death, Meirion Jones and Liz Mackean {{from the}} BBC {{programme}} Newsnight began to investigate {{reports that he}} had sexually abused children. They interviewed one alleged victim on camera and <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> number of others {{who were willing to}} be quoted about alleged abuse at Duncroft Approved School near London, the BBC, and Stoke Mandeville hospital. The headmistress of Duncroft was Meirion Jones's own aunt, Margaret Jones. The Newsnight team, which included former police detective Mark Williams-Thomas, also found out about the Surrey police investigation into Savile. The report was scheduled for broadcast on 7 December 2011, but a decision was taken to cancel its transmission, which ultimately developed into a major crisis for the BBC when the ITV documentary was screened in October 2012. The subsequent Pollard Review found that Jones and MacKean assembled cogent evidence that Savile had a history of abusing young women and Newsnight {{was in a position to}} break the story in 2011. No mention of the dropped Newsnight report was made in public at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Research was key to {{discovering}} Booker and his music. [...] He died in 1983 {{and many}} of the people who knew him are either dead or reaching that certain age when memories start to fade. [...] So we <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lot of people and those conversations led to boxes of old photographs and tapes, video and music libraries in the States and in Europe, and the vaults of television stations, record companies, and museums. [...] Over three years of research went into this production.|$|E
2500|$|Hamilton also {{admitted}} {{he had very}} little memory of the night after getting drunk, {{and did not know}} about the contents of the photos. Hamilton did not see the photos after their release, but listened on the phone as his wife described them to him. After the press conference Rangers general manager Jon Daniels said [...] "My first reaction in January was one of concern. Since then I've <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lot of people and they say it was significant that he came forward immediately and was honest about it." [...] Major League Baseball tested Hamilton for illegal drugs two days after the incident and he passed that test.|$|E

2500|$|In 2016, 27 {{years after}} the incident, Duterte made remarks {{in one of his}} {{campaign}} rallies relating to the 1989 hostage crisis and the raping of the Australian missionary. Duterte made the controversial joke on April 12, when he <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> crowd about Australian missionary Jacqueline Hamill who had been kidnapped, raped and killed in 1989 and said, “She was so beautiful. I thought, the mayor should have been first.” [...] This caused outrage from human rights and women's rights advocates, as well as his presidential campaign rivals which condemned Duterte remarks as insensitive. Duterte claimed to have ordered the storming of Davao Metrodiscom during the April 1989 hostage incident. Duterte apologized for the way he spoke but insisted the remark was not a [...] "joke" [...] as reported by some media outlets and that he had spoken the remark in a narrative and out of [...] "utter anger" [...] when he recalled the incident.|$|E
2500|$|On January 25, 1986, a KXAS news {{crew was}} {{assigned}} to cover a standoff started by 40-year-old Thomas E. Stephens, when he barracaded himself inside an Arlington 7-Eleven store where his estranged wife, Patricia (who filed divorce papers that Thomas was served with the day before), had managed. Believing she had initiated {{the idea of the}} divorce to Patricia, Thomas fatally shot her roommate and store clerk, Terry Palmer, and wounded fellow employee Craig Talley; Patricia later snuck out of the store's front door as Thomas <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hostage negotiator over the phone. Around 6:40p.m., during an update on the standoff within the extended 6:00p.m. newscast as a live shot outside the store was being shown, the videographer on-scene captured Thomas coming out and killing himself with a [...]357-caliber pistol, ending the seven-hour standoff. Then-weekend anchor Mike Snyder (who joined KXAS in 1980, and later served as main anchor of the weeknight newscasts from 1992 until he retired from broadcasting in 2013) issued an on-air apology to viewers for the live broadcast of the suicide.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2007 {{interview}} with MTV, Radcliffe stated that, for him, Harry {{is a classic}} coming of age character: [...] "That's what the films are about for me: a loss of innocence, going from being a young kid {{in awe of the}} world around him, to someone who is more battle-hardened by the end of it." [...] He also said that for him, important factors in Harry's psyche are his survivor's guilt in regard to his dead parents and his lingering loneliness. Because of this, Radcliffe <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bereavement counsellor to help him prepare for the role. Radcliffe was quoted as saying that he wished for Harry to die in the books, but he clarified that he [...] "can't imagine any other way they can be concluded." [...] After reading the last book, where Harry and his friends do indeed survive and have children, Radcliffe stated he was glad about the ending and lauded Rowling for the conclusion of the story. Radcliffe stated that the most repeated question he has been asked is how Harry Potter has influenced his own life, to which he regularly answers it has been [...] "fine," [...] and that he did not feel pigeonholed by the role, but rather sees it as a huge privilege to portray Harry.|$|E

2500|$|Crowe {{returned}} to Australia at age 21, intending {{to apply to}} the National Institute of Dramatic Art. [...] "I was working in a theatre show, and <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> guy who was then the head of technical support at NIDA", Crowe has recalled. [...] "I asked him what he thought about me spending three years at NIDA. He told me it'd be a waste of time. He said, 'You already do the things you go there to learn, and you've been doing it for most of your life, so there's nothing to teach you but bad habits.'" [...] From 1986 to 1988, he was given his first professional role by director Daniel Abineri, in a New Zealand production of The Rocky Horror Show. He played the role of Eddie/Dr Scott. He repeated this performance in a further Australian production of the show, which also toured New Zealand. In 1987, Crowe spent six months busking when he could not find other work. In the 1988 Australian production of Blood Brothers, Crowe played the role of Mickey. He was also cast again by Daniel Abineri in the role of Johnny, in the stage musical Bad Boy Johnny and the Prophets of Doom in 1989.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} The Ends of Human Life Emanuel used the AIDS patient [...] "Andrew" [...] {{as an example}} of moral medical dilemmas. Andrew [...] <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> local support group and signed a living will asking that life {{sustaining}} procedures be withdrawn if there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The will was not given to anyone but kept in his wallet, and no one was given power of attorney. [...] There were questions about his competence since he had AIDS dementia when he signed the will. Still, Andrew's lover said that he had talked about such situations, and asked that Andrew be allowed to die. Andrew's family strongly disagreed that Andrew wanted to die. Dr. Wolf previously saved Andrew's life, but promised to help him avoid a [...] "miserable death". [...] The ICU wanted guidance from Dr. Wolf as to how aggressively they should try to keep Andrew alive, as his chances of surviving a cardiac arrest were about zero. Two other critical patients were recently refused admission because of a bed shortage. There was a question as to whether Andrew's lover was representing Andrew's wishes or his own. There was also a question as to whether Andrew’s parents knew Andrew better than others, or whether they were motivated by guilt from rejecting Andrew's identification as a gay male. The cost of aggressive treatment was $2,000 per day.|$|E
2500|$|James Freeman, a 16-year-old {{friend of}} Tennison from Texarkana, {{came forward and}} <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> deputy {{prosecutor}} after hearing that Tennison confessed to being the Phantom. Freeman explained that {{on the night of}} Virgil Starks' death, he was with him at Tennison's house playing cards or checkers between 7 p.m. and midnight. That night, they both heard the news of Starks' death. Tennison's brothers, J. D. Jr. and Craig, said the confession and suicide were [...] "fantastic things" [...] induced by reading too many comic books. They both stated {{that he did not know}} guns, and did not care for weapons, hunting, or shooting. All guns that Tennison would have had access to did not match the bullets used in the Phantom murders. Craig said that he taught Tennison how to drive a car in the summer of 1947. Bowie County Sheriff Presley stated that he was notified Tuesday, November 9, that the fingerprints from Tennison did not match those at the Booker/Martin crime scene. A ballistics expert from Little Rock, Arkansas revealed that cartridge cases of test bullets fired from rifles Tennison would have had access to were nothing like the case of the bullets found at Starks' home. In 2013, a relative of Doodie claimed that all ballistics testing from these available guns were irrelevant since they were most likely not the guns Doodie used; especially if the real guns were disassembled and hidden as stated in his note.|$|E
