5|$|The {{ecliptic}} forms {{one of the}} {{two fundamental}} planes used as reference for positions on <b>the</b> <b>celestial</b> sphere, the other being <b>the</b> <b>celestial</b> equator. Perpendicular to the ecliptic are the ecliptic poles, the north ecliptic pole being the pole north of the equator. Of the two fundamental planes, the ecliptic is closer to unmoving against the background stars, its motion due to planetary precession being roughly 1/100 that of <b>the</b> <b>celestial</b> equator.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{theories}} of his predecessors, Zhang Heng systematically developed <b>the</b> <b>celestial</b> sphere theory. An armillary constructed {{on the basis of}} his hypotheses bears a remarkable similarity to Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. However, Zhang Heng did not definitely propose a theoretical model like Ptolemy's earth-centered one. It is astonishing that <b>the</b> <b>celestial</b> model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. Only a single step separates <b>the</b> <b>celestial</b> globe from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step.|$|E
5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to <b>the</b> <b>celestial</b> sphere, forming <b>the</b> <b>celestial</b> equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses <b>the</b> <b>celestial</b> equator at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on <b>the</b> <b>celestial</b> equator. The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} volume, Makkari has been chosen as the [...] "chosen one" [...] that <b>the</b> awakened Dreaming <b>Celestial</b> {{communicates}} with. This is very frustrating to Ajak because he has spent his entire existence communing with <b>the</b> <b>Celestials,</b> their language and what their showing up means. In conversations between Makkari and <b>the</b> Dreaming <b>Celestial,</b> we find out that <b>the</b> <b>Celestials</b> pick or create a planet and seed it with life forms. They then create 100 Eternals and 100 Deviants. <b>The</b> <b>Celestials</b> then keep a watchful eye on the planet and weigh which of the two races influences the life forms more. This is done in servitude of the Fulcrum. If the Deviants influence has more prominence, <b>the</b> <b>Celestials</b> send <b>the</b> Horde to eradicate the race and they start over. If it is <b>the</b> Eternals, <b>the</b> <b>Celestials</b> allow <b>the</b> goodness to flow back into the Fulcrum, which <b>the</b> <b>Celestials</b> seems to serve.These conversations between Makkari and <b>the</b> Dreaming <b>Celestial</b> take place on a different plane of existence and cause Makkari's body to shut down, seemingly almost dying, which Sersi is concerned with because she thinks he is addicted to this state. We also see here the origin of <b>the</b> Dreaming <b>Celestial</b> and how he came to be put to sleep by <b>the</b> other <b>Celestials.</b>|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Celestials</b> {{returned}} {{to judge the}} worthiness of their creations a few years ago, the Eternals found themselves clashing with the Deviants again, and decided to publicly reveal their existence to humanity. Zuras feared {{what would happen if}} <b>the</b> <b>Celestials</b> judged unfavorably. They encountered Thor again, and were attacked by Thor's father Odin and the Olympian gods, who tried to prevent their interfering with the gods' plans to attack <b>the</b> <b>Celestials.</b> Eventually, <b>the</b> Eternals decided to help the gods and formed a Uni-Mind to assist the Destroyer's assault on <b>the</b> <b>Celestials.</b>|$|R
5|$|Edward Grant, a {{historian}} of science, {{has provided evidence}} that medieval scholastic philosophers generally considered <b>the</b> <b>celestial</b> spheres to be solid {{in the sense of}} three-dimensional or continuous, but most did not consider them solid in the sense of hard. The consensus was that <b>the</b> <b>celestial</b> spheres were made of some kind of continuous fluid.|$|E
5|$|In Cicero's Dream of Scipio, {{the elder}} Scipio Africanus {{describes}} an ascent through <b>the</b> <b>celestial</b> spheres, compared {{to which the}} Earth and the Roman Empire dwindle into insignificance.

5|$|In {{addition}} to borrowing deities from <b>the</b> <b>Celestial</b> Masters and the Shangqing School, the Lingbao School also developed its own gods. The supreme god of Lingbao Daoists {{is known as}} the Yuanshi Tianzun or <b>the</b> <b>Celestial</b> Worthy of the Original Beginning, who played a similar role to the deified Laozi in <b>the</b> <b>Celestial</b> Masters. According to the scriptures, this god went through a series of kalpa cycles that were given names similar to dynastic names, until emerging {{at the beginning of the}} Kaihuang period. The next most important god was Laojun, the deified form of Laozi, who was <b>the</b> <b>Celestial</b> Worthy's chief disciple. Below these two main gods in <b>the</b> <b>celestial</b> hierarchy were those deities associated with the Southern Palace, where spirits went after death to prepare for rebirth. The head of this group of gods was known as the Perfected of the Southern Extremities. Beneath him was the Director of the Equerry, who was in charge of the life records of the spirits, and Lord Han, who controlled Fengdu, the city of the dead. Below these principal gods in the Lingbao hierarchy were other deities such as the Five Old Men, the Dragon Kings, and the Demon Kings.|$|E
50|$|In {{their very}} first season, <b>the</b> <b>Celestials</b> had four {{different}} managers. Two future {{major league baseball}} players played for them that year as well: Cecil Coombs and Mike Prendergast. Coombs played for them in 1910 as well. In 1911 and 1912, future big leaguers Jim Bluejacket and Patsy McGaffigan played for <b>the</b> <b>Celestials.</b> 1913 is <b>the</b> only year in which no known future big league players played for <b>the</b> <b>Celestials.</b>|$|R

5|$|Practicing correct sexual {{practices}} was one method of perfecting the body's internal spirits. <b>The</b> <b>Celestial</b> Masters believed that semen is {{the embodiment of}} qi. If someone ejaculated too often, their life would be shortened. In fact, the Xiang'er indicates that people should not even have sex {{for the purposes of}} reproduction. <b>The</b> <b>Celestial</b> Masters frowned upon the practice of heqi (also known as 'The Union of the Breaths') of not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain', and advocated non-ejaculation simply as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Celestial</b> Masters thought that the method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced. Despite their opposition to 'heqi' and reproductive sex, there is the possibility that <b>the</b> <b>Celestial</b> Masters supported sex for purposes other than reproduction, and a Celestial Master text from around the 5th century describes an elaborate sexual ritual.See Kalinowski(1985) for a full description of the ritual.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Celestial</b> Masters {{believed}} {{that there was an}} upcoming apocalypse that would nearly destroy humanity. Only 18,000 adherents of <b>the</b> <b>Celestial</b> Master who had the right balance of qi would survive the disaster. These were the seed people that would repopulate the earth after the destruction.|$|E

5|$|The {{collapse}} of the Kingdom of Wei in 260 CE, along {{with the fall of}} Northern China to the Huns in 317, further scattered adherents to <b>the</b> <b>Celestial</b> Master. <b>The</b> <b>Celestial</b> Masters later reemerged in the 4th and 5th centuries as two distinct offshoots, the Northern and Southern Celestial Masters.|$|E

5|$|Once again, {{this is a}} simplification. Periodic {{motions of}} the Moon and {{apparent}} periodic motions of the Sun (actually of Earth in its orbit) cause short-term small-amplitude periodic oscillations of Earth's axis, and hence <b>the</b> <b>celestial</b> equator, known as nutation.|$|E
50|$|In time, Ship took to space, {{responding}} to the call of <b>the</b> <b>Celestials,</b> with X-Factor unwittingly along for the ride, leaving them temporarily stranded on a planet undergoing its own mutant crisis. <b>The</b> <b>Celestials</b> collected <b>the</b> data Ship had gathered during its stay on Earth and Ship {{came to realize that}} Apocalypse had not created it. <b>The</b> <b>Celestials</b> showed it its true origin.

5|$|This adds a {{periodic}} component {{to the position}} of the equinoxes; the positions of <b>the</b> <b>celestial</b> equator and (vernal) equinox with fully updated precession and nutation are called the true equator and equinox; the positions without nutation are the mean equator and equinox.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} <b>the</b> <b>Celestials</b> {{has long been}} unknown, with many species across the {{mainstream}} Marvel universe having legends of their beginning, none {{of which have been}} validated.

50|$|One {{thousand}} years ago, <b>the</b> <b>Celestials</b> {{announced that they}} would return in a millennium to judge humanity. The male godheads of the various pantheons agreed to prepare to battle them. Fearing that <b>the</b> <b>Celestials</b> were too powerful, Gaea gathered the female godheads and formed an alternate plan: to prove humanity's worth by choosing 12 individuals, each one representing {{the best of a}} human activity, knowledge, endeavor or talent (such as music or hunting), making them into gods, and putting them into a magical sleep under the Earth, watched over by goddesses (each pantheon taking turns) until <b>the</b> <b>Celestials</b> returned.

5|$|To {{calculate}} what astronomical {{features a}} structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If {{you were to}} go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around <b>the</b> <b>celestial</b> pole. This point is +90° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as declination. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between <b>the</b> <b>Celestial</b> Poles is <b>the</b> <b>Celestial</b> Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where {{you are on the}} globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.|$|E
5|$|Apart from meteors {{within the}} {{atmosphere}} and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west {{at a rate of}} 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near <b>the</b> <b>celestial</b> equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.|$|E
5|$|Mercator {{also added}} {{a feature of}} special value to seamen: from the {{numerous}} compass or wind roses he drew rhumb lines rather than great circles.
