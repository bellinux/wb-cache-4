50|$|At first, he {{attempted}} to use bamboo for one hundred and twenty two pipes. His experiment failed, and the bamboo pipes were eventually used as ornamental pipes located at the rear side. The organ was finally completed in 1824, after Fr. Cera {{decided to make the}} <b>trumpets</b> using <b>metal,</b> musical characteristics of which he could not replicate with bamboo.|$|R
50|$|Many of the long, {{straight}} <b>metal</b> <b>trumpets</b> {{that first}} appeared {{around this time}} {{were associated with the}} spread of Islam. In Africa, for example, end-blown <b>metal</b> <b>trumpets</b> are found only in Islamic regions such as Nigeria, Chad and central Cameroon. Known as kakaki (among the Hausa of Nigeria) or gashi (in Chad), these trumpets consist of narrow cylindrical tubes, sometimes over 2 m in length, with flared metal bells. The silver nafiri is one of only two trumpets found in Malaysia; its name clearly derives from the Arabic būq al-nafīr. Slightly less than 1 m long, a single nafiri is present in each of the royal nobat ensembles maintained by the local sultans. As in Africa, these royal ensembles play on ceremonial occasions and Islamic holidays.|$|R
50|$|The kakaki is a {{three to}} four metre long <b>metal</b> <b>trumpet</b> used in Hausa {{traditional}} ceremonial music. Kakaki is the name used in Chad, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Benin Niger, and Nigeria. The instrument {{is also known as}} waza in Chad and Sudan, and malakat in Ethiopia.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} trumpets {{date back}} to 1500 BC and earlier. The bronze and silver trumpets from Tutankhamun's grave in Egypt, bronze lurs from Scandinavia, and <b>metal</b> <b>trumpets</b> from China {{date back to}} this period. Trumpets from the Oxus civilization (3rd millennium BC) of Central Asia have decorated swellings in the middle, yet are made out of one sheet of metal, which is considered a technical wonder.|$|R
50|$|After {{the fall}} of the Western Empire in 476, the trumpet {{disappeared}} from Europe {{for more than half a}} millennium. Elsewhere the art of bending long metal tubes was lost, for the trumpets of the succeeding era lacked the characteristic G-like curve of the cornu and buccina. The straight-tubed Roman tuba, however, continued to flourish in the Middle East among the Sassanids and their Arabic successors. The Saracens, whose long <b>metal</b> <b>trumpets</b> greatly impressed the Christian armies at the time of the Crusades, were ultimately responsible for reintroducing the instrument to Europe after a lapse of six hundred years.|$|R
50|$|During {{the last}} centuries of the Roman Empire the name buccina was widely used {{throughout}} the Near East to denote {{a particular type of}} straight trumpet similar to, and probably derived from, the Roman tuba. From this, undoubtedly, derives the generic term būq, which first occurs after 800; this was the name used by the Arabs to describe a variety of both trumpet-like and horn-like instruments. The būq al-nafīr ("buccina of war") was a long straight <b>metal</b> <b>trumpet</b> used in the military bands of the Abbasid period (750-1258) and thereafter; by the 14th century it could be as much as 2 m long. From the 11th century, this term was used to denote any long straight trumpet.|$|R
5000|$|Generation Swine {{received}} mixed reviews. The {{staff review}} of Sputnikmusic highlights the experimental {{nature of the}} production which [...] "is devoted to hard rock tracks structurally very similar to their so-called 'classic era' but sonically re-wired and approached from a direction entirely alien to the band" [...] and praises [...] "the vast improvement, {{or at the very}} least development, in Nikki Sixx's songwriting", finally declaring Generation Swine [...] "a worthwhile experiment for the band that produced some of their most enduring music." [...] David Grad of Entertainment Weekly praises Vince Neil's voice, which lost [...] "none of its hormonal urgency" [...] and describes the music as a fine display [...] "of highly burnished <b>metal</b> <b>trumpeting</b> the pleasures of drugs and nasty sex." [...] Martin Popoff calls it [...] "the summer record of '97." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Chinese too {{had a long}} {{cylindrical}} <b>metal</b> <b>trumpet</b> {{known as}} haotong (or, in Japanese, dokaku), {{which may have been}} related to the foregoing instruments. In place of a bell, the haotong had a long, broad cylinder made of wood, iron or brass, into which the rest of the instrument could be telescoped when not in use; the haotong was played with the bell end resting on the ground. The ordinary Chinese trumpet was the laba (rappa in Japanese). This came from Mongolia, where it was called the rapal. It had a narrow, conical bore and consisted of two or three sections which telescoped into each other. (Chinese sources record the use of trumpets on the battlefield by the Huns, or Xiongnu, in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE.) ...|$|R
50|$|Rara {{is a form}} of festival {{music that}} {{originated}} in Haiti, that is used for street processions, typically during Easter Week. The music centers on a set of cylindrical bamboo trumpets called vaksen (which may also be made of metal pipes), but also features drums, maracas, güiras or güiros (a percussion instrument), and metal bells, as well as sometimes also cylindrical <b>metal</b> <b>trumpets</b> which are made from recycled metal, often coffee cans. The vaksen-s perform repeating patterns in hocket and often strike their instruments rhythmically with a stick while blowing into them. In the modern day, standard trumpets and saxophones may also be used. The genre though predominantly Afro-based has some Taino Amerindian elements to it {{such as the use of}} güiros and maracas.The songs are always performed in Haitian Creole and typically celebrate the African ancestry of the Afro-Haitian masses. Vodou is often implemented through the procession. The genre was imported to the Dominican Republic and is now an integral part of the Afro-Dominican music scene, where it is known colloquially as gagá. In the Dominican Republic, the music is often played by the Afro-Dominican population as a cultural tribute to their African ancestors in the same manner as their counterparts in Haiti. Rara in Haiti is often used for political purposes, with candidates commissioning songs praising them and their campaigns. Rara lyrics also often address difficult issues, such as political oppression or poverty. Consequently, rara groups and other musicians have been banned from performing and even forced into exile—most notably, folk singer Manno Charlemagne who later returned to Haïti and was elected mayor of Port-au-Prince in the 1990s.|$|R
