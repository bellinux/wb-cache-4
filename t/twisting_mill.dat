50|$|The Lincoln Mill {{began in}} 1900 as an entirely locally funded concern. One of the investors was Trevanian Dallas, {{founder of the}} adjcent Dallas Mill. Named the Madison Spinning Company, the {{original}} building was built on Oakwood Avenue. The mill required more capital to continue operating by 1903, and outside investors were brought in, including William Lincoln Barrell. Despite the extra cash, the mill closed in 1906. It reopened in 1908 under the name Abingdon Mills. Abingdon constructed a new mill building in 1915, and an addition to it in 1916. The mill was expanded again in 1918, with a two-story addition to the <b>twisting</b> <b>mill,</b> bringing capacity to 28,080 spindles and 476 looms. 47 houses and the village's first school were also built.|$|E
50|$|In 1871 {{the first}} of the large modern mill {{buildings}} was built {{on the north side of}} the river. This was to be known as No 3 <b>Twist</b> <b>Mill</b> (and now called Brook <b>Mill).</b> No 2 <b>Twist</b> <b>Mill</b> (now called Valley Mill) was built nearby in 1881 and the third and largest mill, No 1 Spinning Mill, was built in 1894. By then the company operated some 50,000 spindles and employed some 2000 workers.|$|R
50|$|The large steam-powered Bowreah Cotton Mills {{opened at}} Fort Gloster near Calcutta by British {{interests}} in the 1820s, using British women to impart machine-spinning skills to the local workforce. They closed down in 1837 but reopened with Dwarkanath Tagore as a major shareholder, and by 1840 lay at the centre of a major industrial complex powered by five steam engines, that included a <b>twist</b> <b>mill,</b> foundry and a rum distillery.|$|R
50|$|Built in 1881, it is a Grade II listed building. Originally {{built as}} a <b>twist</b> <b>mill</b> it was {{converted}} to a ring spinning mill in 1903. It is built of brick and cast iron in four storeys with a flat roof, 16 bays in length by 6 bays from front to back. It has a bell cupola in one corner and was originally steam powered, having an 800hp single cylinder engine by Hick Hargreaves.|$|R
50|$|The complex was {{initially}} established in 1814 {{by members of}} the Birley family. The original block was an 8-storey building, including two storeys below ground level, of 20 bays and is the oldest surviving fireproof mill in Greater Manchester. It was powered by a 100hp Boulton and Watt beam engine and illuminated by gas produced in the basement, where it was stored in three gasholders. It stands adjacent to Chorlton Old Mill, rebuilt in 1866 on the site of Robert Owen's 1795 Chorlton <b>Twist</b> <b>Mill.</b>|$|R
50|$|He {{moved to}} Manchester, and was {{employed}} at Satterfield's Drapery in St Ann's Square (a plaque currently marks the site). With money borrowed {{from his brother}} {{he set up a}} workshop making spinning mules but exchanged the business for 6 spinning mules, which he operated in a rented space. In 1792 he was made manager of the Piccadilly Mill at Bank Top by the mill-owner Peter Drinkwater at the age of 21, but after two years he voluntarily gave up a contracted promise of partnership in the company and left to go into partnership instead with other entrepreneurs to establish and manage the Chorlton <b>Twist</b> <b>Mills</b> in Chorlton-on-Medlock.|$|R
50|$|After a cow {{farm was}} {{established}} around 1266, Barley earned its livelihood from agriculture. This continued {{up until the}} 18th century. During the 18th century textiles began to be manufactured as an extra source of income. The brooks around Barley offered an effective source of waterpower {{which led to the}} building of several cotton factories. Two small cotton mills were built at Narrowgates and Barley Green. At its height, Barley Green Mill had 200 looms, until floods destroyed the building in 1880. The cotton <b>twist</b> <b>mill</b> at Narrowgates, which was built by William Hartley to spin cotton warp thread, and the adjacent weavers cottages survive and are now private houses.|$|R
5000|$|William Murdoch and his pupil Samuel Clegg {{installed}} retorts {{in individual}} factories and work places. The earliest example was in 1805, at Lee and Phillips, Salford <b>Twist</b> <b>Mill</b> where 8 gas holders were installed. [...] This was shortly followed by one in Sowerby Bridge, constructed by Clegg for Henry Lodge. The first independent commercial gas works {{was built by}} the London and Westminster Gas Light and Coke Company in Great Peter Street, Westminster in 1812 laying wooden pipes to illuminate Westminster Bridge with gas lights on New Year's Eve in 1813. Public gas lights were seen as a crime reduction measure, and as such, and until the 1840s, regulation lay with the Police Authority rather than the elected council.|$|R
50|$|Until 1860, {{everything}} that Haigh Foundry made {{had to be}} hauled up the steep and <b>twisting</b> Leyland <b>Mill</b> Lane. Teams of up to 48 horses were needed, many hired from local farmers. However a railway line was built from the Earl of Crawford & Balcarres' colliery network at Aspull in 1860 and was replaced in 1869 by a link from the Lancashire Union Railway's 'Whelley' loop.|$|R
5|$|The {{well-established}} {{textile processing}} and trading infrastructure, and the ready {{supply of water}} from the River Irwell and its tributaries, attracted entrepreneurs who built cotton mills {{along the banks of the}} river in Pendleton and Ordsall. Although Salford followed a similar pattern of industrial development to Manchester, most businesses preferred to build their premises on the Manchester side of the Irwell, and consequently Salford did not develop as a commercial centre in the same way as its neighbour. Many of these earlier mills had been based on Arkwright-type designs. These relied on strong falls of water, but Salford is on a meander of the Irwell with only a slight gradient and thus mills tended to be built upstream, at Kersal and Pendleton. With the introduction of the steam engine in the late 18th century however, merchants began to construct mills closer to the centres of Salford and Manchester, where supplies of labour and coal were more readily available (the first steam-powered mill was built in Manchester in 1780). One of the first factories to be built was Philip's and Lee's <b>Twist</b> <b>Mill</b> in Salford, completed in 1801, the second iron-framed multi-story building to be erected in Britain. The large Salford Engine <b>Twist</b> Company <b>mill</b> was built to the west of Salford, between Chapel Street and the Irwell, and in 1806 was the first large cotton mill to use gas lighting. It was however outnumbered by the numerous smaller factories and mills throughout the area, including Nathan Gough's steam-driven mule spinning mill, near Oldfield Road, where a serious accident occurred on 13 October 1824 (see illustration).|$|R

40|$|Haskell Silk Company founder, James Haskell, was {{a native}} of the Cape Anne, area of Massachusetts. In this locale his early career {{included}} service in numerous public and business capacities, not least as agent for The Rockport Steam Cotton Company, and as a State Senator. He was a man experienced in politics, finance and textile production. He moved to Maine in 1858 when he acquired the cotton mill at Saccarappa Falls, Westbrook. Under his management the mill, renamed The Westbrook Manufacturing Company, flourished and expanded. In 1874, his elder son, Frank Haskell, assumed the role of agent. At the same time James took advantage of, by now, well developed machine twist-making technology and launched into the youngest branch of the textile industry [...] silk. The Haskell Silk Company was established as a twist maker in 1874 and incorporated in 1876. Family money financed the venture forming a closely held corporation, more like a family partnership. This undoubtedly contributed to the Haskell Silk Company 2 ̆ 7 s long term stability [...] something unusual in the volatile silk industry. In business for more than 50 years (1874 - 1930) Haskell {{is one of the few}} U. S. silk companies with a history spanning the rise and demise of industrial silk manufacture in America.

40|$|Reported {{drilling}} {{methods for}} CFRP/Ti stacks include <b>twist</b> drilling, end <b>milling,</b> core grinding, and their derived methods. The literature {{does not have}} any report on drilling of CFRP/Ti stacks using rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM). This paper, for the first time, reports a study on drilling of CFRP/Ti stacks using RUM. It also compares results on drilling of CFRP/Ti stacks using RUM with reported results on drilling of CFRP/Ti stacks using other methods. When drilling CFRP/Ti stacks using RUM, cutting force, torque, and CFRP surface roughness were lower, hole size variation was smaller, CFRP groove depth was smaller, tool life was longer, and there was no obvious Ti exit burr and CFRP entrance delamination. Ti surface roughness when drilling of CFRP/Ti stacks using RUM was about the same as those when using other methods...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCurrently {{composites}} {{are being}} used to replace conventional metallic materials {{in a wide range of}} industries including aerospace, aircraft and defense which require structural materials with high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios. GFRP composites are used in fairings, passenger compartments, and storage room doors due to their high mechanical properties. Out of all the machining operations, most commonly used operation is drilling. But drilling of these composite materials, irrespective of the application area, can be considered a critical operation, owing to their tendency to delaminate when subjected to mechanical stresses. With regard to the quality of machined component, the principal drawbacks are related to surface delamination, fibre/resin pull-out and inadequate surface roughness of the hole wall. Hence it is essential to understand the drilling behaviour by conducting a large number of drilling experiments and drilling parameters such as feed rate and spindle speed should be optimized. This paper presents the effect of speed and feed on delamination behaviour of composite materials by conducting drilling experiments using Taguchi's L 25, 5 -level orthogonal array and Analysis of variance by using three different tools namely <b>Twist</b> drill,End <b>mill</b> and Kevlar drill. ANOVA was used to analyse the data obtained from the experiments and finally determine the optimal drilling parameters in drilling GFRP composite materials. Results of these experiments revealed that increasing the spindle speed and reducing feed rate can reduce the delamination within limits of specified speed and feed rates. Too low feed rate and too high spindle speed can also increase the delamination. Results also revealed that feed rate is the more influential factor on delamination than spindle speed...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to analyse the {{grinding}} processes and develop a search system of database for cutting tools. Design/methodology/approach: A tool grinding software with open architecture was used to analyse the grinding processes of square end mills, tapered square end mills, ball nose end mills, tapered ball nose end mills, radius end mills, tapered radius end mills, straight flute reamers, helical flute reamers, flat drills, twist drills, and step drills. According to the characteristics of these tools, 20270 data were established in the relational database. The SQL syntax was then utilized for writing the search algorithm, and the C++ Builder was employed for designing human machine interfaces of the search system of the tool database. Findings: A half of time on the tool design and the change of production line for grinding other types of tools can be saved by means of the proposed system. More specifically, the efficiency in terms of the overall machining time was improved up to 10. 58 %, 9. 36 %, 4. 64 %, and 7. 52 % for grinding the radius end mill, tapered radius end <b>mill,</b> <b>twist</b> drill, and step drill, respectively. Research limitations/implications: Special tools have diversification. They can not be taken into consideration in the database system owing to the tools have specific profiles. Therefore, it is difficult to encode by formal rules. Practical implications: The most commercial tool grinding software is the modular-based design and uses tool shapes to construct the CAM interface. However, it is very difficult for users to design new cutting tools. Utilizing the grinding processes to construct the grinding path of tools, and the search system of the database provides more flexible options to develop new cutting tools. Originality/value: The database and search system of cutting tools were presented in this paper. We can save time for production line change, tool design, and tool grinding by employing this kind of system. It also gives more convenience. That is, company’s productivity and benefit can be improved...|$|R
