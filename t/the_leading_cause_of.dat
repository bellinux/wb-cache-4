5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, heart disease had surpassed {{infectious}} disease as <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death in the United States, and it is currently <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> deaths worldwide. Since 1948, the ongoing Framingham Heart Study has shed light on the effects of various influences on the heart, including diet, exercise, and common medications such as aspirin. Although the introduction of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers has improved the management of chronic heart failure, the disease continues to be an enormous medical and societal burden, with 30 to 40% of patients dying within a year of receiving the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Colony Collapse Disorder Working Group, based {{primarily}} at Pennsylvania State University, was established. Their preliminary report pointed out some patterns, but drew no strong conclusions. A survey of beekeepers early in 2007 indicated most hobbyist beekeepers believed that starvation was <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death in their colonies, while commercial beekeepers overwhelmingly believed invertebrate pests (Varroa mites, honey bee tracheal mites, and/or small hive beetles) were <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> colony mortality. A scholarly review in June 2007 similarly addressed numerous theories and possible contributing factor, but left the issue unresolved.|$|E

5|$|A {{hospital}} was established at Fort Russell for U.S. Army, Navy and Marine Corps personnel. In August 1840, the Army surgeon {{at the hospital}} treated 103 patients, including 23 for fever and 26 for dysentery.

The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women {{under the age of}} 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk of cardiovascular disease amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men. Many aspects of cardiovascular disease vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention and outcome.|$|E

Occasionally, the infection can spread {{to in the}} peritoneum causing inflammation {{and the formation of}} scar tissue on the external surface of the liver (Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome).|$|E
5|$|People with SCI are at {{especially}} {{high risk for}} respiratory and cardiovascular problems, so hospital staff must be watchful to avoid them. Respiratory problems (especially pneumonia) are <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death in people with SCI, followed by infections, usually of pressure sores, urinary tract infections and respiratory infections. Pneumonia can be accompanied by shortness of breath, fever, and anxiety.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 24–45% {{of people}} with SCI suffer disorders of depression, and the suicide rate is as much as six {{times that of the}} rest of the population. The risk of suicide is worst in the first five years after injury. In young people with SCI, suicide is <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death. Depression is associated with an increased risk of other complications such as UTI and pressure ulcers that occur more when self-care is neglected.|$|E

Because it is largely asymptomatic in its earliest stages, more than 50% of women have stage III or higher cancer (spread beyond the ovaries) {{by the time they}} are diagnosed, with a consequent poor prognosis.|$|E
5|$|Norovirus is <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> {{gastroenteritis}} {{among adults}} in America, causing greater than 90% of outbreaks. These localized epidemics typically occur when {{groups of people}} spend time in close physical proximity to each other, such as on cruise ships, in hospitals, or in restaurants.

Crowded, traffic-choked Northeastern cities including Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Boston, Providence, Philadelphia, Newark, Hartford, New Haven, Springfield and Worcester, Massachusetts, {{were most likely to}} have car accidents.

According to NOAA, 25 of the 71 right whale deaths reported since 1970 resulted from ship strikes.|$|E

5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}}, {{which include}} {{diseases of the}} heart, are <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death worldwide. The majority of cardiovascular disease is noncommunicable and related to lifestyle and other factors, becoming more prevalent with ageing. Heart disease is {{a major cause of}} death, accounting for an average of 30% of all deaths in 2008, globally. This rate varies from a lower 28% to a high 40% in high-income countries. Doctors that specialise in the heart are called cardiologists. Many other medical professionals are involved in treating diseases of the heart, including doctors such as general practitioners, cardiothoracic surgeons and intensivists, and allied health practitioners including physiotherapists and dieticians.|$|E
5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an oil fire with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high heat of the oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This is <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} there is little iodine in the diet, {{typically}} remote inland areas and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, iodine deficiency gives rise to hypothyroidism, symptoms of which are extreme fatigue, goitre, mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low basal body temperatures. Iodine deficiency is <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> preventable intellectual disability, a result that occurs primarily when babies or small children are rendered hypothyroidic {{by a lack of}} the element. The addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this problem in the wealthier nations, but iodine deficiency remains a serious public health problem today in the developing world. Iodine deficiency is also a problem in certain areas of Europe. Information processing, fine motor skills, and visual problem solving are improved by iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient children.|$|E
