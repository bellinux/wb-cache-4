This article {{addresses}} some of these changes <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the economic aspects. These include the basic economic conditions of the culture, the development of trade, interaction with other cultures and the apparent use of barter tokens, an early form of money.|$|E

He {{explains that}} this knowledge is had by the rationality of any adequate causes <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> anything {{common to the}} human mind. An example of this could be anything that is classified as being of imperfect virtue. Imperfect virtues are seen as those which are incomplete. Many philosophers, such as Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle, would compare imperfect virtue to pagan virtue.|$|E

25|$|Findings have {{indicated}} abnormal functioning of brainstem structures in individuals with mental {{disorders such as}} schizophrenia, and other disorders <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> impairments in maintaining sustained attention. Some abnormalities in the average size or shape of some regions of the brain {{have been found in}} some disorders, reflecting genes and/or experience. Studies of schizophrenia have tended to find enlarged ventricles and sometimes reduced volume of the cerebrum and hippocampus, while studies of (psychotic) bipolar disorder have sometimes found increased amygdala volume. Findings differ over whether volumetric abnormalities are risk factors or are only found alongside the course of mental health problems, possibly reflecting neurocognitive or emotional stress processes and/or medication use or substance use. Some studies have also found reduced hippocampal volumes in major depression, possibly worsening with time depressed.|$|E

European intellectual property law is shaped by this notion that ideas are an [...] "extension of oneself and of one's personality". Personality theorists argue that by being a creator of something one is inherently at risk and vulnerable for having their ideas and designs stolen and/or altered. Intellectual property protects these moral claims <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> personality.|$|E
2500|$|English is {{a highly}} nominalised language, and thus lexical meaning is largely carried in nominal groups. This is {{partly because of the}} {{flexibility}} of these groups in encompassing premodifiers and qualification, and partly because of the availability of a special resource called the thematic equative, which has evolved as a means of packaging the message of a clause in the desired thematic form (for example, the clause [...] is [...] is structured as [...] = [...] ). Many things are most readily expressed in nominal constructions; this is particularly so in registers <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the world of science and technology, where things, and the ideas behind them, are multiplying and proliferating all the time.|$|E
