Christopher Rosen from Entertainment Weekly {{described the}} clip as [...] "powerful, disturbing and emotional". Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Radhika Sanghani declared that each scenario in the video appeared realistic and wrote: [...] "by making sure the attacks differ in location, scenario and the appearances of both rapist and victim, Gaga is breaking the myth of there being a 'typical rape'". Corinne Heller from E! believed that the [...] "graphic, emotional and hard to watch" [...] video was able to deliver a [...] "powerful message", one that was close to Gaga due to her real-life rape experience. Wright described the video for NME as a [...] "brutal, monochrome rendering" [...] of the subject matter, with [...] "harrowing" [...] depictions of the rapes. She added that the rape statistics {{at the end of the}} video were [...] "horrifying" [...] but complimented Gaga for using her popularity to promote awareness of the subject. Loretta Donelan from Bustle believed that Gaga's previous music videos had political aspects but were open to interpretations. But with the music video of [...] "Til It Happens to You", she showed maturity by featuring [...] "chilling scenes of staged sexual assaults".|$|E
500|$|In September 2009 the Maple Leafs and Marlies {{opened their}} new hockey {{practice}} facility, the MasterCard Centre. The arena was {{a joint venture}} between MLSE, the City of Toronto and the Lakeshore Lions Club to replace the nearby Lakeshore Lions Arena, and was built at a cost of $44 million, after cost overruns drove up the cost from $33.65 million. [...] The Lions Club contributed $40 million to the project, with the city providing a $35.5 million loan guarantee. [...] The Toronto District School Board leased the land for the arena to the Lakeshore Lions for a 50-year term. MLSE spent a further $5 million on training and medical facilities, and pays $600,000 annually to rent the building. [...] The arena was originally operated by the Lakeshore Lions Club, but in June 2011, with the arena on the verge of defaulting on its rising debt, the City of Toronto took control and assumed its $43.4 million debt with the intention to return it to private management within 2–3 years. [...] A city councillor has suggested that MLSE, which operates BMO Field and Ricoh Coliseum on behalf of the city, would be [...] "the logical party" [...] to take over the arena, and a spokesperson for the company said [...] "while we don't have any interest in purchasing the facility, we are open <b>to</b> <b>discussing</b> the possibility of managing the facility on behalf of the City".

500|$|One {{week before}} the Canadian Grand Prix, the FIA {{declared}} the floor used by Red Bull in Monaco to be illegal, forcing the team to change the offending parts for the Canadian Grand Prix. Despite the ruling, the team's results were kept intact. The team was also forced to change the design of their axles, after FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting felt that holes in the axles contravened the technical regulations. Nevertheless, Sebastian Vettel comfortably took pole position by three-tenths of a second. Vettel controlled the early phase of the race, but was caught and passed by Lewis Hamilton before {{the first round of}} stops, while Fernando Alonso slipped through shortly afterwards. All three drivers were using a two-stop strategy at the time, but as Hamilton made his second stop, both Alonso and Vettel shifted to a one-stop strategy, with Alonso's team resorting <b>to</b> <b>discussing</b> strategy options in his native Spanish to prevent their rivals from overhearing their plans. Hamilton had twenty laps to make up a twelve-second deficit, and he easily reeled Vettel in; in response, Red Bull pitted the reigning World Champion, and Vettel fell to fifth. Hamilton's next target was Alonso, whose tyres lost all grip and he fell victim to Hamilton, Romain Grosjean, Sergio Pérez and Vettel in quick succession. Hamilton won the race, becoming the seventh winner in seven races and taking a two-point lead in the championship. Grosjean's second place saw Lotus take third place in the Constructors' Championship from Ferrari. Both Grosjean and Pérez expressed surprise at finishing on the podium, while 2011 winner Jenson Button finished sixteenth in what he described as his [...] "worst race in years" [...] and Michael Schumacher suffered a hydraulics failure that left his drag reduction system (DRS) device jammed in the open position.|$|E

Prior to this, critics and fans had long speculated whether or not Rachel is Jewish; there are entire websites entirely devoted <b>to</b> <b>discussing</b> this. Vulture's Lindsey Weber, who identifies herself as Jewish, observed several similarities and Jewish stereotypes she shares with the character, citing the facts that Rachel refers to her grandmother Ida Green as [...] "Bubbe", Long Island origin, and engagement to a Jewish doctor as allusions to the character's Jewish culture. In her book Changed for Good: A Feminist History of the Broadway Musical, author Stacy Wolf identified Rachel as one of several popular female television characters who embodied Jewish stereotypes during the 1990s and often served as [...] "the butt of the shows' jokes." [...] Meanwhile, JDate's Rebecca Frankel cited Rachel as one of the earliest and most prominent examples of the Jewish American Princess stereotype on screen. Writing for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Alicia R. Korenman also acknowledged Rachel's initial Jewish American Princess qualities, describing her as [...] "spoiled, dependent on her father's money and her fiance's, is horrified at the thought of working for a living and generally inept in her attempts to do so, and is eventually revealed to have had a nose job", which she eventually overcomes as they become less [...] "evident in later seasons of the show". In his article [...] "Princesses, Schlemiels, Punishers and Overbearing Mothers", Evan Cooper described Rachel as a [...] "de-semitized" [...] Jew because, aside from her name, [...] "there is never any discussion of experiences of growing up in a Jewish culture, no use of Yiddish, and few, if any, references to family members with distinctively Jewish surnames". Cooper continued to write that although Rachel possesses some Jewish American Princess traits, she is more similar to the [...] "little woman" [...] stereotype. The New York Post's Robert Rorke labeled Rachel [...] "a rehabilitated Jewish American Princess", in contrast to her sister Amy (Christina Applegate) who remains [...] "selfish, condescending and narcissistic." ...|$|E
