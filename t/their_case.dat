5|$|A {{variety of}} marine animals possess active {{camouflage}} through {{their ability to}} change colour rapidly. Several bottom-living fish such as the flounder can hide themselves effectively against a variety of backgrounds. Many cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid similarly use colour change, in <b>their</b> <b>case</b> both for camouflage and signalling. For example, the big blue octopus, Octopus cyanea, hunts during the day, and can match itself to the colours and textures of its surroundings, both to avoid predators and to enable it to approach prey. It can perfectly resemble a rock or a coral it is hiding beside. When necessary, in order to scare away a potential predator, it can display markings which resemble eyes.|$|E
5|$|Amato (Bruce Willis) is an {{international}} arms dealer who the Federal Bureau of Investigation have been tracking, as they believe Amato is planning the sale of FIM-92 Stinger missiles stolen from a military arms depot. The FBI agrees to allow Metro-Dade to conduct the surveillance as its equipment was in place first. Crockett and Tubbs watch Amato's abusive relationship with his wife Rita (Katherine Borowitz). When Rita attempts to hire a hitman to kill Amato, Crockett intercepts the call and meets with her, arranging her help in <b>their</b> <b>case</b> in return for her safety. She explains that she has tried to leave Amato before, but he hired thugs to rape her divorce lawyer's wife to scare her into place.|$|E

5|$|Congestion pricing {{has also}} been {{implemented}} for scheduled airline services. The British Airports Authority (BAA) has been a pioneer in implementing congestion pricing {{for all types of}} commercial aviation. In 1972 implemented the first peak pricing policy, with surcharges varying depending on the season and time of the day, and by 1976 raised these peak charges. London-Heathrow had seven pricing structures between 1976 and 1984. In this case it was the US carriers that went to international arbitration in 1988 and won <b>their</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} two weeks of the shutdown, there was little {{progress}} and neither the governor nor the Republican leaders made proposals accepted by the other side. On July 4, Republican lawmakers affirmed their commitment to not agree to a budget of over $34 billion. Documents leaked after June 30 stated that the Republican leadership included anti-abortion provisions, a voter ID requirement, and a ban on stem cell research during the budget negotiations. Both the Republican legislative leaders and Dayton (along with DFL legislative leaders) toured Minnesota to make <b>their</b> <b>case</b> to Minnesotans. The government shutdown ended after Governor Dayton announced on July 14 that he would accept the last Republican offer before the shutdown, albeit with certain conditions.|$|E
5|$|Frogs such as Physalaemus nattereri, Physalaemus deimaticus, and Pleurodema brachyops have {{a warning}} display behaviour. These animals inflate {{themselves}} with air {{and raise their}} hind parts to appear as large as possible, and display brightly coloured markings and eyespots to intimidate predators. Seven species of frogs in the genus Pleurodema have lumbar glands (making the animals distasteful, so in <b>their</b> <b>case</b> the display is likely aposematic); these glands are usually boldly contrasted in black as a further warning.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{received}} a 25-second penalty, which demoted him to third place and advanced Massa and Heidfeld to {{first and second}} positions. McLaren appealed the decision at the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) International Court of Appeal. <b>Their</b> <b>case,</b> however, was declared inadmissible, with the Court ruling that 25 second penalties cannot be challenged. The penalty prompted global press discussion, primarily from the United Kingdom and Italy, with several former drivers questioning the decision. Massa's retroactive victory, with Hamilton demoted to third, narrowed {{the gap in the}} Championship from six points to just two.|$|E
5|$|In 1258, a {{group of}} barons seized power from Henry in a coup d'état, citing the need to {{strictly}} enforce Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest, creating a new baronial-led government to advance reform through the Provisions of Oxford. The barons were not militarily powerful enough to win a decisive victory, and instead appealed to Louis IX of France in 1263–1264 to arbitrate on their proposed reforms. The reformist barons argued <b>their</b> <b>case</b> based on Magna Carta, suggesting that it was inviolable under English law and that the King had broken its terms.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, surgeon J. W. Ballantyne {{considered}} {{the case of}} the Biddenden Maids from a teratological perspective. He suggested that they had in fact been pygopagus (twins joined at the pelvis). Pygopagus twins are known to put their arms around each other's shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings. The pygopagus Millie and Christine McCoy had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from <b>their</b> <b>case</b> that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.|$|E

This openness, however, actually allowed Khrushchev greater control over the Committee, since any dissenters would have to make <b>their</b> <b>case</b> in front of a large, disapproving crowd.|$|E
5|$|In February 2015, Jenner was {{involved}} in a fatal multiple-vehicle collision on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California. Kim Howe, an animal rights activist and actress, was killed when Jenner's SUV ran into Howe's car. Accounts of the sequence of collisions have varied, as have the number of people injured. Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges, but three civil lawsuits were brought by Howe's stepchildren and drivers of other cars involved in the collision. Jessica Steindorff, a Hollywood agent who was hit by Howe's car, settled her case in December 2015. Howe's stepchildren settled <b>their</b> <b>case</b> in January 2016. Financial details were not disclosed in either case.|$|E
5|$|In St-Calais' time as bishop, {{a long-running}} dispute began between the monks {{of the cathedral}} chapter and {{successive}} bishops. This arose because St-Calais {{did not make a}} formal division of the diocesan revenues between the bishop's household and the monks of the chapter. Nor had he allowed free elections of the prior. He may have promised these things to the monks before his death, but nothing was in writing. Thus, when a non-monk was selected to replace St-Calais, the monks began a long struggle to secure what they felt had been promised to them, including the forging of charters ascribed to St-Calais that supported <b>their</b> <b>case.</b> These forged charters date from {{the second half of the}} 12th century.|$|E

40|$|Twenty-four genera {{representing}} ten {{families of}} case-building caddis larvae were tested for {{their capacity to}} recognize and re-enter <b>their</b> <b>cases</b> following eviction from them. Glossosomatidae entered cases readily only under conditions of turbulence, which was the only condition under which they tended to remain in <b>their</b> <b>cases.</b> A small sample of Hydroptilidae showed excellent case recognition. In eight families of tube-case builders, some degree of recognition was present in all, but only the Phryganeidae consistently showed good recognition and rapid entry. Entry by backing occurred in two genera of different families. It is suggested that case recognition is a primitive trait which has been reduced or lost in several species. The trait is probably unnecessary in these species because the larvae rarely leave <b>their</b> <b>cases...</b>|$|R
5|$|Initially, Kentucky {{had wanted}} {{the jury to}} force NASCAR to grant the {{speedway}} a Sprint Cup Series event but in 2007 they changed their demand to instead force the France family to sell either NASCAR or ISC. The track is also demanding that NASCAR develop objective standards for the awarding of their race events and damages of $200 million. In January 2008, the court dismissed the lawsuit, saying that the plaintiffs had failed to make <b>their</b> <b>case.</b> Kentucky Speedway says they will appeal the court's decision.|$|E
5|$|Many {{families}} of moths have special organs to help detect bat echolocation. These organs {{are known as}} tympana (singular – typanum). The Pyraloidea and almost all Geometroidea have tympana located on the anterior sternite of the abdomen. The Noctuoidea also have tympana, but in <b>their</b> <b>case,</b> the tympana are located {{on the underside of}} the metathorax, the structure and position of which are unique and a taxonomic distinguishing feature of the superfamily.|$|E
5|$|Michael Farrar {{underwent}} surgery in December 1995 to treat an abscess {{in his brain}} caused by the poisoning. Fearful that Farrar would not survive the proceedings, and knowing that his testimony was key to <b>their</b> <b>case,</b> prosecutors videotaped his testimony beforehand. The surgery was successful, and Farrar testified in person and recounted Green's problems with alcohol and the break-up of their marriage. Under cross-examination by Green's counsel, he admitted that both he and Green had contributed to {{the problems in the}} couple's marriage and that his relationship with his son had been so adversarial that they had sometimes come to blows.|$|E

5|$|Norreis was {{a native}} of {{northern}} England and his family was probably of Norse origin. He was a monk at Christ Church Priory, the cathedral chapter of Canterbury Cathedral; when he became a monk is unknown. In 1187 he was appointed treasurer of the priory, and in that role was sent by the cathedral chapter to King Henry II of England to plead <b>their</b> <b>case</b> against Baldwin of Forde, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The archbishop and his monks were in dispute over Baldwin's plan to found a collegiate church at Hackington in honour of Thomas Becket which most of the monks opposed because they feared it would diminish the prestige of their priory.|$|E
5|$|The Republican minor officeholders {{returned}} to the state courts with <b>their</b> <b>case.</b> Franklin County circuit court justice James E. Cantrill ruled against them, and the Kentucky Court of Appeals, then the state's court of last resort, sustained Cantrill's ruling {{by a vote of}} 4–3. Republican Attorney General Clifton J. Pratt continued with legal challenges and finally was allowed to serve out his term. Though Cantrill's decision was based on the invalidation of Louisville's vote and the votes of four counties in eastern Kentucky, none of the legislators from those areas were unseated.|$|E
5|$|The Samian War {{was one of}} {{the last}} {{significant}} military events before the Peloponnesian War. After Thucydides' ostracism, Pericles was re-elected yearly to the generalship, the only office he ever officially occupied, although his influence was so great as to make him the de facto ruler of the state. In 440 BC Samos went to war against Miletus over control of Priene, an ancient city of Ionia on the foot-hills of Mycale. Worsted in the war, the Milesians came to Athens to plead <b>their</b> <b>case</b> against the Samians.|$|E
