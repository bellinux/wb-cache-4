500|$|It is from Arrian {{that the}} most famous quote on the {{sporting}} fairness of coursing originates: [...] "...true huntsmen do not take out their hounds to catch the creature, but for a trial of speed and a race, and they are satisfied if the hare manages <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> will rescue her".|$|E
500|$|... {{definitely}} {{paved the}} way for the filmmakers and distributors of the world to know that there was a female audience that was really strong out there", Gabler recalls, one that was not segmented by age. She pointed to later movies, such as Mamma Mia!, 27 Dresses (written by McKenna) and Me Before You, that appeared to her to be trying to replicate The Devil Wears Pradas success with that demographic. However, Gabler feels they did not do so as well. [...] "Prada reminds me of movies that we don't have a lot of now—it harkens back to classic movies that had so much more than just one kind of plot line ... You just keep wanting <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> can touch upon the same zeitgeist as this film." ...|$|E
500|$|Two filmed {{scenes from}} [...] "Season 4" [...] were cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scenes were {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season four DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the first scene, in the TGS make-up room, Jenna asks Liz for a ride to Pennsylvania so that she can buy a Confederate Flag so that she can wear as a tube top on her appearance on Fox & Friends, however, Liz cannot give her a ride as she is busy. Kenneth stops by and informs Jenna that actress Mischa Barton is on the phone and wants to speak with her. Jenna, however, tells Kenneth to tell Barton that the deal is off as she has decided to go country. In the second scene, Jack and Lenny go through Kenneth's page desk, while Kenneth is participating in the page strike. The two hope <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> would damage Kenneth's reputation but instead the two come up empty.|$|E
5000|$|According to Kant's {{principle}} of reason, {{everything that is}} conditioned {{is part of a}} total series of conditions. The essential nature of reason tries <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> unconditioned <b>that</b> functions as a beginning of the series.|$|R
50|$|Chapter 8: The OvumBathybius is in {{the studies}} room, further observing the two. He returns to his notes <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> unusual <b>that</b> he had written down and then begins to delve and {{question}} the potential of God compared to Man.|$|R
60|$|The valise {{itself was}} only packed with the few {{necessaries}} for a month's sojourn at the Conciergerie; and the men, under Merlin's guidance, were vainly trying <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something,</b> anything <b>that</b> might be construed into treasonable correspondence with the unfortunate prisoner there.|$|R
2500|$|Today, the retrieval-failure hypothesis, {{concerning}} {{the function of}} the memory, is more widely accepted and popularized (Schöpper-Grabe 1998:237). It says that the storage of information happens on different levels. Therefore, information or memory is not deleted, but rather, the access to the current level is blocked. Thus, the information is not available. Hansen quotes Loftus & Loftus (1976) to describe forgetting: [...] " [...] much like being unable <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> we have misplaced somewhere" [...] (1999: 10). Cohen states, evidence for knowing that a learner is not able to [...] "find" [...] something, is the use of the so-called progressive retrieval (1986). Thereby, the learner is unable to express something that is in his mind and consequently uses an incorrect form. He eventually remembers the correct one (Cohen 1986; Olshtain 1989). Time is considered the decisive factor to measure how far the attrition has proceeded already (de Bot & Weltens, 1995).|$|E
2500|$|For {{the ending}} of the film, Iliadis {{and the rest of the}} {{creative}} team chose to include the song [...] "Dirge", by psychedelic rock band Death in Vegas. Iliadis was hoping <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> was both [...] "ironic" [...] and [...] "innocent" [...] at the same time, given the events in the film that would precede its usage. To the director, the choice helped to illuminate the fact that nothing will be the same for this family again. Craven comments on the choice to have John Collingwood return to finish off Krug at the end. Craven explains, [...] "I also found it interesting that the Dr., whose oath 'does no harm', intentionally [...] and that it kinda shows that when seeking revenge you can become something evil yourself if you don't stop once what's been necessary is done. So I also found it intriguing that we're just seeing these wonderful, perfect people but the father comes back and goes out of his way to do this." ...|$|E

2500|$|Three adult geocachers, a 24-year-old {{woman and}} her parents, were trapped in a cave and rescued by firefighters in Rochester, New York, while searching for an ammo can in 2012.

He hated to own it, but the proof was overwhelming. She knew the power of her beauty and had treated him as a confiding fool. He was not revengeful and had been a fool, but it hurt him badly {{to realize that she}} was not what he had thought. He hardly spoke to Lucille, who came in now and then, and did not ask for Clare, as he had hitherto done. The girl did not know this because she was taking the rest she needed after a week of strain.|$|E

60|$|At first, {{one who is}} {{accustomed}} to the forms and movements of a sea-port feels a little disappointment at seeing a river that bears nothing but dingy barges loaded with charcoal and wine-casks. The magnificence of the quays seems disproportioned to the trifling character of the commerce they are destined to receive. But familiarity with the town soon changes all these notions, and while we admit that Paris is altogether secondary, so far as trade is concerned, we come to feel the magnificence of her public works, and <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is pleasing and picturesque, even in her huge and unwieldy wood and coal barges. Trade {{is a good thing}} in its way, but its agents rarely contribute to the taste, learning, manners, or morals of a nation.|$|E

50|$|Drag kings {{are largely}} a {{phenomenon}} of lesbian culture and can most often be seen at lesbian bars or festivals. However, not all drag kings are lesbians, and some participants in the drag king subculture are not otherwise involved in lesbian culture, society, or politics. Drag kings are a diverse group, making difficult <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> universal <b>that</b> all drag kings have in common. By performing masculinity on the non-cisgender male body, these performers are resisting society's notions of the gender binary. Some transmen also self-identify as drag kings.

60|$|The gentlemen now {{began to}} {{pass into the}} boat the {{different}} things that had been provided, principally by the foresight of Mademoiselle Viefville, where they were received by Paul who thrust them beneath the roof without stopping to lose the precious moments in stowage. They included mattresses, the trunks that contained their ordinary sea-attire, or those that were not stowed in the baggage-room, blankets, counterpanes, potted meats, bread, wine, various condiments and prepared food, from the stores of Saunders, and generally such things as had presented themselves in the hurry of the moment. Nearly half of the articles were rejected by Paul, as unnecessary, though he received many in consideration of the delicacy of his feebler companions, which {{would otherwise have been}} cast aside. When he found, however, that food enough had been passed into the boat to supply the wants of the whole party for several weeks, he solicited a truce, declaring it indiscreet to render themselves uselessly uncomfortable in this manner, {{to say nothing of the}} effect on the boat. The great requisite, water, was still wanting, and he now desired that the two domestics might get into the boat to arrange the different articles, while he endeavoured <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> might serve as a substitute for sails, and obtain the all-important supply.|$|E
60|$|What {{the genius}} of {{imagination}} and romance did thus in ancient times with the scenery of nature, it did also {{on the field of}} history. Men explored that field not at all to learn sober and actual realities, but <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> they might embellish and adorn, and animate with supernatural and marvelous life. What the sober realities might have actually been, was of no interest or moment to them whatever. There were no scholars then as now, living in the midst of libraries, and finding constant employment, and a never-ending pleasure, in researches for the simple investigation of the truth. There was in fact no retirement, no seclusion, no study. Every thing except what related to the mere daily toil of tilling the ground bore direct relation to military expeditions, spectacles and parades; and the only field for the exercise of that kind of intellectual ability which is employed in modern times in investigating and recording historic truth, was the invention and recitation of poems, dramas and tales, to amuse great military audiences in camps or public gatherings, convened to witness shows or games, or to celebrate great religious festivals. Of course under such circumstances there would be no interest felt in truth as truth. Romance and fable would be far more serviceable for such ends than reality.|$|E
60|$|It is {{probably}} {{this lack of}} taste on K'dunk's part that accounts for the astonishing variety in his food. Nothing {{in the shape of}} an insect seemed to come amiss to him. Flies, wasps, crickets, caterpillars, doodle-bugs, and beetles of every description were all treated alike to the same red flash of his tongue and the blinking gulp. A half-dozen boys and girls, who were watching the queer pet with me, were put to their wits' end <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> he would not eat. One boy, who picked huckleberries, brought in three or four of the disagreeable little bugs, known without a name by every country boy, that have the skunk habit of emitting overpowering odors when disturbed, thinking that he had found a poser for our pet; but K'dunk gobbled them up {{as if they had been}} set before him as a relish to tickle his appetite. Another brought potato bugs; but these too were fish for K'dunk's net. Then a third boy, who had charge of a kitchen garden, went away wagging his head and saying that he had just picked something that no living thing would eat. When he came back he had a horse-radish bottle that swarmed with squash-bugs, twenty or thirty of the vile-smelling things, which he dumped out on the ground and stirred up with a stick.|$|E

This album marked a sonic evolution for The Delta Saints as they expanded from their signature Bayou-blues sound to home in on rock ‘n’ roll. Lead single “California” [...] off Monte Vista is an anthem for throwing caution to the wind, skipping town and setting out <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> more <b>that</b> embodies the restless and searching spirit of Monte Vista, a collection of coming-of-age ruminations on life, love, self-discovery and the world at large.|$|R
