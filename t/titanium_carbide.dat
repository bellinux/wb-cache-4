5|$|The {{currently}} known {{processes for}} extracting titanium from its various ores are laborious and costly; {{it is not}} possible to reduce the ore by heating with carbon (as in iron smelting) because titanium combines with the carbon to produce <b>titanium</b> <b>carbide.</b> Pure metallic titanium (99.9%) was first prepared in 1910 by Matthew A. Hunter at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute by heating TiCl4 with sodium at 700–800°C under great pressure in a batch process known as the Hunter process. Titanium metal was not used outside the laboratory until 1932 when William Justin Kroll proved that it can be produced by reducing titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) with calcium. Eight years later he refined this process with magnesium and even sodium in what became known as the Kroll process. Although research continues into more efficient and cheaper processes (e.g., FFC Cambridge, Armstrong), the Kroll process is still used for commercial production.|$|E

25|$|The engine has {{a single}} rotor with a {{capacity}} of 497cc. The rotor spins on an eccentric shaft in a peritrochoid (Mazda uses an epitrochoid) chamber, giving three rotations of the crankshaft for every 360° of rotor travel. Compression ratio is 9.4:1. The eccentric shaft runs on plain bearings, which were better than rollers for heat dissipation. Combustion sealing utilised Apex, corner and side seals. At the three rotor apexes, tip sealing was accomplished with a three-piece seal tensioned by a blade spring. Apex seals were made of a special material known as Ferro Tic, which {{was a combination of}} sintered ferrous alloy and <b>titanium</b> <b>carbide.</b> The surface of the trochoid chamber which the apex seals rubbed along was coated with a CEM (composite electrochemical material) consisting of nickel silicon carbide. Side sealing used one blade-like seal and spring for each rotor face on each side (six side seals in total). Corner seals and springs finished the isolation of combustion. Blow-by gases are recirculated into the combustion process. The rotor spins backward in relation to the motorcycle. Primary power transfer to the clutch and transmission is by duplex chain.|$|E

40|$|Production of low silicon {{hot metal}} is an {{essential}} part of successful treatment of vanadium containing titania-magnetite ore in blast furnace. The formation of <b>titanium</b> <b>carbides</b> and <b>titanium</b> nitrides very much depends on solubility of titanium in hot metal. The analysis showed that with reduction in silicon content the content of titanium in hot metal is also reduced. Similarity in silicon and titanium reduction allows usage of the same factors to control content of these elements in hot metal. Increase in furnace pressure reduces silicon and titanium content in hot metal and first of all titanium-carbide formation. At actual blast furnace conditions the content of <b>titanium</b> <b>carbides</b> is far from equilibrium and materials residence time is an important control parameter. Increase in coke strength after reaction (CSR) improves permeability of coke packing and accelerates filtration of the melt, suppressing titanium-carbides formation. Increase in hearth's height to width ratio with the same hearth's volume also positively affects operation of blast furnace. Uniform descent of pellets and sinter, and uniform distribution of limestone in furnace cross-section stabilize the heat transfer conditions further suppressing formation of titanium-carbides. The practical measures to retard titanium-carbides formation and to produce high quality low silicon and low titanium hot metal are proposed and implemented at Nizgniy Tagil I & S Works in Russia (NTMK) with increase in blast furnace specific productivity up to 3. 5 thm/m 3 /day...|$|R
