25|$|Thalamotomy, {{involving}} {{the creation of}} lesions in the brain region called the thalamus, is quite effective in treating patients with essential, cerebellar, or Parkinsonian tremor. This in-hospital procedure is performed under local anesthesia, with the patient awake. After the patient’s head is secured in a metal frame, the surgeon maps the patient’s brain to locate the thalamus. A small hole is drilled through the skull and a temperature-controlled electrode is inserted into the thalamus. A low-frequency current is passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> to activate the tremor and to confirm proper placement. Once the site has been confirmed, the electrode is heated to create a temporary lesion. Testing is done to examine speech, language, coordination, and tremor activation, if any. If no problems occur, the probe is again heated to create a 3-mm permanent lesion. The probe, when cooled to body temperature, is withdrawn and the skull hole is covered. The lesion causes the tremor to permanently disappear without disrupting sensory or motor control.|$|E
2500|$|Most glucometers today use an {{electrochemical}} method. Test strips {{contain a}} capillary that sucks up a reproducible amount of blood. The glucose {{in the blood}} reacts with an enzyme electrode containing glucose oxidase (or dehydrogenase). The enzyme is reoxidized with an excess of a mediator reagent, such as a ferricyanide ion, a ferrocene derivative or osmium bipyridyl complex. The mediator in turn is reoxidized by reaction at the electrode, which generates an electric current. [...] The total charge passing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> {{is proportional to the}} amount of glucose in the blood that has reacted with the enzyme. The coulometric method is a technique where the total amount of charge generated by the glucose oxidation reaction is measured over a period of time. The amperometric method is used by some meters and measures the electric current generated at a specific point in time by the glucose reaction. This is analogous to throwing a ball and using the speed at which it is travelling at a point in time to estimate how hard it was thrown. The coulometric method can allow for variable test times, whereas the test time on [...] a meter using the amperometric method is always fixed. Both methods give an estimation of the concentration of glucose in the initial blood sample.|$|E

50|$|Space clamp errors. A single {{electrode}} is a {{point source}} of current. In distant parts of the cell, the current passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> will be less influential than at nearby parts of the cell.

50|$|When a {{microelectrode}} {{is inserted}} into an aqueous ionic solution, {{there is a}} tendency for cations and anions to react with the electrode creating an electrode-electrolyte interface. The forming of this layer has been termed the Helmholtz layer. A charge distribution occurs across the electrode, which creates a potential which can be measured against a reference electrode. The method of neuronal potential recording is dependent on the type of electrode used. Non-polarizable electrodes are reversible (ions in the solution are charged and discharged). This creates a current flowing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrode,</b> allowing for voltage measurement <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> with respect to time. Typically, non-polarizable electrodes are glass micropipettes filled with an ionic solution or metal. Alternatively, ideal polarized electrodes do not have the transformation of ions; these are typically metal electrodes. Instead, the ions and electrons at the surface of the metal become polarized with respect to the potential of the solution. The charges orient at the interface to create an electric double layer; the metal then acts like a capacitor. The change in capacitance with respect to time can be measured and converted to voltage using a bridge circuit. Using this technique, when neurons fire an action potential they create changes in potential fields that can be recorded using microelectrodes.|$|E
50|$|For novices in electrochemistry, the {{predictions}} of this equation appear counter-intuitive, i.e. that ip increases at faster voltage scan rates. It {{is important to remember}} that current, i, is charge (or electrons passed) per unit time. In cyclic voltammetry, the current passing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> is limited by the diffusion of species to the electrode surface. This diffusion flux is influenced by the concentration gradient near the electrode. The concentration gradient, in turn, is affected by the concentration of species at the electrode, and how fast the species can diffuse through solution. By changing the cell voltage, the concentration of the species at the electrode surface is also changed, as set by the Nernst equation. Therefore, a faster voltage sweep causes a larger concentration gradient near the electrode, resulting in a higher current.|$|E

50|$|An arc {{between two}} {{electrodes}} can be initiated by ionization and glow discharge, when <b>the</b> current <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> is increased. <b>The</b> breakdown voltage of <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> gap is a combined {{function of the}} pressure, distance between electrodes and type of gas surrounding <b>the</b> <b>electrodes.</b> When an arc starts, its terminal voltage is much less than a glow discharge, and current is higher. An arc in gases near atmospheric pressure is characterized by visible light emission, high current density, and high temperature. An arc is distinguished from a glow discharge partly by the approximately equal effective temperatures of both electrons and positive ions; but in a glow discharge, ions have much less thermal energy than the electrons.|$|R
50|$|The Dynamitron's {{accelerating}} {{column is}} contained within a pressure vessel filled with high pressure Sulfur Hexafluoride insulating gas. The column {{is composed of}} a number of rectifier tubes, assembled in cascades. Semi-circular corona rings are attached to the anode and cathode of each rectifier in the cascade. Two rf electrodes are mounted near the inner surface of the tank. This circuit, with a resonance frequency around 100 kHz, is coupled inductively with an oscillator. Because of its high power, the oscillator sits in a separate tank. Parallel coupling of the cascade to the liners is accomplished <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> to corona ring capacitance. The main advantage of this parallel coupling design is that it allows a much higher beam current to be transported than a typical Cockcroft-Walton style accelerator.|$|E
50|$|But at {{very fast}} rates of discharge, the acid already {{inside the body}} of the plate is used up quickly and fresh acid cannot diffuse <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> in time to {{continue}} the reaction. Hence the reaction is favored toward the outer wall of the electrode, where crystals may form in a dense mat, rather than in dispersed clumps throughout the plate. This mat of crystals further impedes electrolyte transfer. The crystals then grow larger, and because the larger crystals have a large volume compared to their surface area it becomes difficult to remove them chemically during charging, particularly as the concentration of the sulfuric acid in the electrolyte is likely to be high (since only limited lead sulfate has been created {{on the surface of the}} plate) and lead sulfate is less soluble in concentrated sulfuric acid (above about 10% concentration by weight) than it is in dilute sulfuric acid.|$|E
50|$|For this to work, {{the cell}} {{capacitance}} must {{be higher than}} the electrode capacitance by at least an order of magnitude. Capacitance slows the kinetics (the rise and fall times) of currents. If the electrode capacitance is much {{less than that of}} the cell, then when current is passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrode,</b> the electrode voltage will change faster than the cell voltage. Thus, when current is injected and then turned off (at the end of a duty cycle), the electrode voltage will decay faster than the cell voltage. As soon as the electrode voltage asymptotes to the cell voltage, the voltage can be sampled (again) and the next amount of charge applied. Thus, the frequency of the duty cycle is limited to the speed at which the electrode voltage rises and decays while passing current. The lower the electrode capacitance the faster one can cycle.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Some {{patients}} with {{deep brain stimulation}} (DBS), where removal of implants is indicated due to hardware related infections, are not candidates for later re-implantation. In these patients a rescue lesion <b>through</b> <b>the</b> DBS <b>electrode</b> has been suggested as an option. In this case report we present a patient where a pallidotomy was performed using <b>the</b> DBS <b>electrode.</b> CASE DESCRIPTION: An elderly woman with bilateral Gpi DBS suffered an infection around the left burr hole involving <b>the</b> DBS <b>electrode.</b> A unilateral lesion was performed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> DBS <b>electrode</b> before it was removed. No side effects were encountered. Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) dystonia movement scale score was 39 before DBS. With DBS before lesioning BFM score was 2. 5 points. The replacement of the left sided stimulation with a pallidotomy resulted in only a minor deterioration of the score to 5 points. CONCLUSIONS: In the case presented here a small pallidotomy performed with <b>the</b> DBS <b>electrode</b> provided a satisfactory effect on the patient's dystonic symptoms. Thus, rescue lesions <b>through</b> <b>the</b> DBS <b>electrodes,</b> although off-label, might be considered in {{patients with}} Gpi DBS for dystonia when indicated.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the determination of two critical constitutive properties for mass transport of ions through porous electrodes saturated with a liquid electrolyte solution. One is the effective diffusivity that is required to model the mass transport at the representative element volume (REV) level of porous <b>electrodes</b> in <b>the</b> framework of Darcy's law, while the other is the pore-level mass-transfer coefficient for modeling the mass transport from the REV level to the solid surfaces of pores induced by redox reactions. Based on the theoretical framework of mass transport <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), unique experimental setups for electrochemically determining the two transport properties by measuring limiting current densities are devised. The effective diffusivity and the pore-level mass-transfer coefficient <b>through</b> <b>the</b> porous <b>electrode</b> made of graphite felt, a typical material for VRFB electrodes, are measured at different electrolyte flow rates.

50|$|The {{principle}} of gas diffusion {{is illustrated in}} this diagram. The so-called gas distribution layer {{is located in the}} middle of the electrode. With only a small gas pressure, the electrolyte is displaced from this pore system. A small flow resistance ensures that the gas can freely flow inside the electrode. At a slightly higher gas pressure the electrolyte in the pore system is restricted to the work layer. The surface layer itself has such fine pores that, even when the pressure peaks, gas cannot flow <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> into the electrolyte. Such electrodes were produced by scattering and subsequent sintering or hot pressing. To produce multi-layered electrodes a fine-grained material was scattered in a mold and smoothed. Then, the other materials were applied in multiple layers and put under pressure. The production was not only error-prone but also time consuming and difficult to automate.|$|E

By using a Solarton workstation, the cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of cells were performed. A focus ion beam-scanning electron microscope {{was used to determine}} the morphology of the electrodes before and after the high rate pulse discharge (HRPD) cycling. After testing, pure PTMA and LiFePO4 electrode give a sharp redox peak and decrease the voltage gap between oxidation and reduction. Therefore, PTMA and LiFePO4 improve the rate and reversibility of the redox couples. Furthermore, the hybrid cathodes have a lower charge-transfer resistance, allowing easier migration of Li ions <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> interface. Moreover, PTMA/LiFePO4 has a longer life cycle compared to pure LiFePO4 or PTMA systems.|$|E
