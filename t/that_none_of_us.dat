5|$|Secondary School {{is a big}} {{waste of}} time. What are French {{teachers}} doing? None of us can speak French. How much maths can you do? Do you know any history? What is the point in training people to do things <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can do? The system seems designed to qualify you for the Indian Civil Service in 1911. We all leave school unable to drive! Now that would be quite handy.|$|E
25|$|We know it well <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> acting {{alone can}} achieve success.|$|E
25|$|How do you sum {{up one of}} {{the most}} {{remarkable}} endings any of us will ever be fortunate enough to see? How do you sum {{up one of the}} most exciting bowl games ever contested? And how do you sum up what will one day be viewed as one of the most significant moments in the history of college football? I’m not exaggerating....Boise State beating Oklahoma in a New Year’s Day bowl game is college football’s equivalent to George Mason reaching the Final Four, with one extremely significant difference: George Mason had its chance to compete for the national title; Boise State does not. Like it or not, Boise State 43, Oklahoma 42 just became the single biggest argument to date for a college football playoff....Not only did they get in the game, they made a major statement on behalf of their mid-major brethren <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> will soon forget.|$|E
6000|$|... "Remarkable, most remarkable." [...] Mrs. Grantly was {{revolving}} {{the message}} in her mind. [...] "There were two attempts on Mr. Dunbar's life. The subconscious mind cannot explain <b>that,</b> for <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> knew <b>of</b> the accident to-day." ...|$|R
60|$|Without {{any further}} form of {{farewell}} {{he passed away}} from us. It was so obviously his wish {{to be allowed to}} depart <b>that</b> we <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> cared to stop him. Then we all three looked at one another.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, my dear; she won't scold anybody any more; {{and it will}} be {{a blessing}} for some, I must say. Everybody is always so {{considerate}} in this house, Miss Posy, <b>that</b> we <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> know nothing about what that is." ...|$|R
25|$|I {{regret to}} say <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{approved}} of the marriage at that time. Mother thought Jack was too young, and Lottie and I felt that Olive, being in musical comedy, belonged to an alien world. Ollie had all the rich, eligible men of the social world at her feet. She had been deluged with proposals from her own world of the theater as well. Which {{was not at all}} surprising. The beauty of Olive Thomas is legendary. The girl had the loveliest violet-blue eyes I have ever seen. They were fringed with long dark lashes that seemed darker because of the delicate translucent pallor of her skin. I could understand why Florenz Ziegfeld never forgave Jack for taking her away from the Follies. She and Jack were madly in love with one another but I always thought of them as a couple of children playing together.|$|E
500|$|The use of {{children}} proved very controversial. Incoming mayor Albert Boutwell and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy condemned {{the decision to}} use children in the protests. Kennedy was reported in The New York Times as saying, [...] "an injured, maimed, or dead child is a price <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can afford to pay", although adding, [...] "I believe that everyone understands their just grievances must be resolved." [...] Malcolm X criticized the decision, saying, [...] "Real men don't put their children on the firing line." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{incorporates}} the song [...] "Wonderful! Wonderful!" [...] by musician Johnny Mathis. Having read the screenplay Mathis {{refused to allow}} his version to be used, owing to the episode's graphic content, and a cover version had to be created. Producer David Nutter, who had a background as a singer, intended to record the vocals {{but at the last}} minute another singer, who sounded more like Mathis, was used. Manners explained that he wanted to use the song because [...] "certain songs have a creepy, icky quality <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have really openly acknowledged".|$|E
60|$|She {{gave him}} the hand which Arthur had seized upon. I think <b>that</b> we had <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> before seen a smile so {{dazzling}} as hers.|$|R
60|$|Up to <b>that</b> moment <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had {{suspected}} <b>that</b> {{there was a}} second coon anywhere near. He had remained hidden and safe in the tree-top through all the uproar, until what seemed plainly a call for help came, when he threw all thought of self aside and came down like a hero.|$|R
6000|$|The 'predatory rich' (to use Mr. Stead's felicitous term) {{put their}} hands into our pockets because they know <b>that,</b> virtually, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> will refuse to take their hands in our own afterwards, in {{friendly}} salutation. If notorious rascality entailed social outlawry the only rascals would be those properly--and proudly--belonging to the 'criminal class.' ...|$|R
500|$|Clash {{resigned}} from Sesame Workshop on November 20, 2012, and {{released a statement}} saying, [...] "Personal matters have diverted {{attention away from the}} important work 'Sesame Street' is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer. I am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately." [...] Sesame Workshop also released a statement: [...] "Unfortunately, the controversy surrounding Kevin's personal life has become a distraction <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> want, and he has concluded that he can no longer be effective in his job and has {{resigned from}} 'Sesame Street.'" [...] They stated that other puppeteers had been trained to serve as Clash's understudy and would take over his roles on the show.|$|E
500|$|In 1957, Drake {{was sent}} to Eagle House School, a preparatory {{boarding}} school in Berkshire. Five years later, he went to Marlborough College, a public school in Wiltshire, attended by his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He developed an interest in sport, becoming an accomplished sprinter over 100 and 200 yards, representing the school's Open Team in 1966. He played rugby for the C1 House team and was appointed a House Captain in his last two terms. School friends recall Drake at this time as having been confident and [...] "quietly authoritative", while often aloof in his manner. His father Rodney remembered, [...] "In one of his reports [...] said <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> seemed to know him very well. All the way through with Nick. People didn't know him very much." ...|$|E
2500|$|The serialists {{were all}} there. And {{so were the}} Americanists, both Aaron Copland's group and Virgil 's. And here was {{something}} that {{had come out of}} Boston <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had ever heard of and was completely different from either. There was nearly a riot in the foyer [...] — everybody shouting. A real whoop-dee-doo.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Serenity, <b>that's</b> the word! <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> could {{remember}} what the word was. It's a ripping good thing to have. I should be awfully bucked {{if you would have}} it, too.' ...|$|R
6000|$|From all {{of which}} it will be {{gathered}} <b>that</b> since <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> is perfect, even in Thomas there were weak points. For instance, he had {{what is known as}} a [...] "temper," [...] also he was blessed with a good idea of himself and his own abilities, and had a share of that intolerance by which this is so often accompanied.|$|R
60|$|There {{never was}} a {{completer}} victory; I was the only non-combatant left on the field. I would not have deserted my countrywoman anyhow, but indeed I had no desires in <b>that</b> direction. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> like mediocrity, but we all reverence perfection. This girl's music was perfection in its way; {{it was the worst}} music that had ever been achieved on our planet by a mere human being.|$|R
2500|$|In 1972 {{the band}} members decided to choose a new name when they signed to Wooden Nickel Records after being spotted by a talent scout at a concert at St. John of the Cross Parish in Western Springs, Illinois (James Young's hometown). Several {{suggestions}} were made and, according to DeYoung, the name Styx was chosen because it was [...] "the only one <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> hated".|$|E
2500|$|Metallica {{performed}} [...] "Am I Evil" [...] {{along with}} the other bands in the Big 4 (Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer) at the 2010 Sonisphere festival, and with Diamond Head themselves at the Sonisphere festival in Knebworth on 8 July 2011. Lars Ulrich said that there was [...] "a pretty good chance <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would be here" [...] without Brian Tatler before playing the song. Brian performed [...] "Helpless" [...] with Metallica and Anthrax at the Sonisphere festival in Amnéville on 9 July 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Amid {{a growing}} {{consensus}} in the United States that U.S. aid to contain communism in Indochina was necessary, State Department diplomat Charlton Ogburn sounded a cautionary note. [...] "The trouble is <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> knows enough about Indochina and [...] "we have had no real political reporting from there since [...] Reed and [...] O'Sullivan left two years ago." [...] Ogburn said the Viet Minh had fought the French to a draw and were unlikely [...] "to wilt under the psychological impact of American military assistance." [...] Even if defeated, the Viet Minh could return to guerrilla tactics and bide their time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{one thing}} I quite forgot, a {{fortnight}} ago," [...] he said, slowly, [...] "when I suggested <b>that</b> we should <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{look at a}} newspaper {{all the time we}} were in California. Have you kept to our bargain, Professor?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Patton was {{explaining}} {{some of the}} changes you have made," [...] remarked Compton. Patton was the shop foreman. [...] "He said they were so simple <b>that</b> he wondered <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had thought <b>of</b> them before. I quite agree with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Holt and {{the other}} farmers were shown into the room, and Holt {{as a matter of}} course became the spokesman. When Caldigate had shaken hands with them all round, each muttering his word of welcome, then Holt began: 'We wish you to know, squoire, <b>that</b> we, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> ain't been {{comfortable}} in our minds here at Folking since that crawling villain Crinkett came and showed himself at our young squire's christening.' ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, Hoppus told Risen {{that he was}} a {{registered}} Libertarian. [...] "To me it means to respect other people and let them do their own thing. The government is there to help people but not control them," [...] he remarked. A 2000 Rolling Stone profile notes that Hoppus [...] "pray every night". He elaborated on his religious views in a 2005 interview: [...] "It's amazing to me that anyone can say that one thing is right. [...] To draw lines over something <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> on earth could possibly comprehend seems like a waste of time." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{urged that}} {{presently}} polarized national debate be conducted [...] "in {{a way that}} heals, not {{in a way that}} wounds." [...] Quoting the Book of Job 30:26, he observed that [...] "terrible things happen for reasons that defy human understanding." [...] He then said, [...] "For the truth is <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can know exactly what triggered this vicious attack", and that no one can know [...] "what thoughts lurked in the inner recesses of a violent man's mind". Urging his listeners to avoid using the tragedy as [...] "one more occasion to turn on one another", he recommended humility, empathy and especially reflection instead, urging people to consider whether they have [...] "shown enough kindness and generosity and compassion to the people in our lives".|$|E
60|$|We {{discovered}} <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{knew how}} to find him. Stroeve grew more and more distressed.|$|E
60|$|The idea seemed reasonable, but the {{difficulty}} in the way was <b>that</b> we <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> knew where Emily's grave was {{any more than the}} ghost of Johnson himself did. The Governor suggested palming off some other Emily's grave upon the poor thing, but, as luck would have it, there did not seem to have been an Emily of any sort buried anywhere for miles round. I never came across a neighbourhood so utterly destitute of dead Emilies.|$|R
60|$|We {{had been}} in prison for about a fortnight, when one day--oh! shall I ever forget it?--we heard in the {{distance}} a noise like the rumbling of thunder; nearer and nearer it came, and soon the sound became less confused, cries and shrieks could be heard above that rumbling din; but so weird and menacing did those cries seem <b>that</b> instinctively--though <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> knew what they meant--we all felt a nameless terror grip our hearts.|$|R
6000|$|... "He has {{certainly}} won a loyal champion, Miss Porter," [...] said Captain Dufranne, laughing. [...] "I am sure <b>that</b> there be <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> here but would willingly face death {{a hundred times}} in its most terrifying forms to deserve the tributes of one even half so loyal--or so beautiful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps that {{is better}} than {{following}} Gerald's example. But you mustn't be unjust. You know <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would think of thwarting you." ...|$|E
60|$|If so, I {{shall be}} sorry; {{but it will}} be a comfort to think <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> need go any farther than we choose.|$|E
60|$|It was on Joseph's lips {{to answer}} <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are immortal, but he bethought {{him that the}} pleasantry might be ill-timed, and bowed in silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in {{the sense}} you mean, Sergeant--no, not in that p'int of view; never! At least, not in my opinion. I know that natur' is weak--human natur', I mean--and <b>that</b> we should <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> vaunt <b>of</b> our gifts, whether red or white; but I do not think a truer-hearted lad lives on the lines than Jasper Western." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{you always}} wanted things that wouldn't do. But other plans would have come. And {{how can you}} marry Mr. Ladislaw, <b>that</b> we <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> ever thought you could marry? It shocks James so dreadfully. And then it is all so {{different}} from what you have always been. You would have Mr. Casaubon because {{he had such a}} great soul, and was so and dismal and learned; and now, to think of marrying Mr. Ladislaw, who has got no estate or anything. I suppose it is because you must be making yourself uncomfortable in some way or other." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{story of}} Russian Mennonite {{conscientious}} objectors (hereafter COs) {{is probably not}} well-known. It {{is a very important}} story because it explains in large part how it is that we now are Canadians and not Russians, why we live where we do, and why this “objecting” feature is still a facet of our lives today. Without the events <b>of</b> <b>that</b> story, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would be here in Altona, Manitoba, Canada, this evening, and in all likelihood, not be what makes us tick. (This essay is a slightly revised talk given to the Altona History Seekers at Garden on Tenth on March 16, 2017...|$|R
