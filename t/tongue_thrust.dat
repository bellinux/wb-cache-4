But the canoes of the superior kind, which seem to be their men-of-war, are magnificently adorned with openwork, and covered with loose fringes of black feathers, which had a most elegant appearance. The gunwale boards were also frequently carved in a grotesque taste, and adorned with tufts of white feathers placed upon black ground. The paddles are small and neatly made. The blade is of an oval shape, or rather of a shape resembling a large leaf, pointed at the bottom, broadest in the middle, and gradually losing itself in the shaft, the whole length being about six feet. By the help of these oars they push on their boats with amazing velocity." ...|$|E

60|$|When their {{wars are}} {{conducted}} on the sea, the islanders embark in war-canoes, which are so large as {{to be able to}} carry from sixty to eighty and even a hundred men. Captain Cook tells us that the ingenuity of these people appears in nothing more than in their canoes. They are long and narrow. One that he measured was sixty-eight and a half feet long, five feet broad, and three feet and a half deep. The bottom was sharp, with straight sides like a wedge. Each side consisted of one entire plank sixty-three feet long, ten or twelve inches broad, and an inch and a quarter thick. The bottom part of the canoe was hollowed out, and these planks were lashed to it with strong plaiting. A grotesque ornament projected six feet beyond the head, and it had a sort of stern-post that rose to a height of about fourteen feet. Both the head and the stern-post were beautifully carved, and the canoe was propelled by means of short paddles, the men sitting with their faces in the direction in which they were going. The heads of many of the canoes were curious, in some cases it was the figure of a man with a face as ugly as can well be conceived, with a monstrous <b>tongue</b> <b>thrust</b> out of the mouth, and white shells stuck in for eyes.|$|E
5000|$|Speech is not {{frequently}} {{affected by}} the <b>tongue</b> <b>thrust</b> swallowing pattern. The [...] "S" [...] sound (lisping) is the one most affected.

However, lisping and <b>tongue</b> <b>thrust</b> are not always associated.|$|E
5000|$|Since 1958, {{the term}} [...] "tongue thrust" [...] has been {{described}} and discussed in speech and dental publications by many writers. Many school-age children have <b>tongue</b> <b>thrust.</b> For example, according to recent literature, as many as 67-95 percent of children 5-8 years old exhibit <b>tongue</b> <b>thrust,</b> which {{may be associated with}} or contributing to an orthodontic or speech problem.

5000|$|Factors {{that can}} {{contribute}} to <b>tongue</b> <b>thrusting</b> include macroglossia (enlarged tongue), thumb sucking, large tonsils, hereditary factors, ankyloglossia (tongue tie), and certain types of artificial nipples used in feeding infants, also allergies or nasal congestion can cause the tongue to lie low in the mouth because of breathing obstruction and finally contributing to <b>tongue</b> <b>thrusting.</b> In addition, it is also seen after prolonged therapy by levodopa in Parkinsonism, also it occurs as extra pyramidal side effect (Acute muscular dystonia) after use of Neuroleptics (Anti-Psychotics).|$|R
50|$|<b>Tongue</b> <b>thrusting</b> {{and speech}} {{problems}} may co-occur. Due to unconventional postures {{of the tongue}} and other articulators, interdental and frontal lisping are very common.

50|$|While {{identifying}} {{the causes of}} <b>tongue</b> <b>thrust,</b> {{it is important to}} remember that the resting posture of the tongue, jaw, and lips are crucial to normal development of mouth and its structures. If tongue rests against the upper front teeth, the teeth may protrude forward, and adverse tongue pressure can restrict the development of the oral cavity. The tongue lies low in the mouth or oral cavity and is typically forwarded between upper and lower teeth. If <b>tongue</b> <b>thrust</b> behavior is not corrected, it may affect the normal dental development. The teeth may be pushed around in different directions during the growth of permanent teeth.|$|E
25|$|Harmful habits such as thumb sucking or <b>tongue</b> <b>thrusting</b> {{can result}} in or exaggerate an {{alveolar}} prognathism, causing teeth to misalign.

50|$|Diastema is {{sometimes}} caused or {{exacerbated by the}} action of a labial frenulum (the tissue connecting the lip to the gum) causing high mucosal attachment and less attached keratinized tissue which is more prone to recession or by <b>tongue</b> <b>thrusting,</b> which can push the teeth apart.|$|R
40|$|The loss of {{anterior}} teeth has serious functional, esthetic disabilities, {{in addition to}} compromising the patients' quality of life.

The chronic mouth breathing due to nasal adenoids is known to enhance the gingival and periodontal diseases. The dental literature proves the association of nasal breathing, <b>tongue</b> <b>thrusting,</b> and anterior open bite. Arch shape and tooth position are primarily determined by the equilibrium of the forces from tongue and perioral musculature. Increased force from tongue musculature in the <b>tongue</b> <b>thrusting</b> patient leads to flaring of {{anterior teeth}}, making them susceptible for periodontal and traumatic tooth loss. Replacement of the anterior teeth in this patient will also help in restoration of anterior guidance, which is critical for the health of temporomandibular joint, posterior teeth, and musculature...|$|R

5000|$|Tongue {{thrusting}} can {{adversely affect}} the teeth and mouth. A person swallows from 1,200 to 2,000 times every 24 hours with about four pounds (1.8 kg) of pressure each time. If a person suffers from tongue thrusting, this continuous pressure tends {{to force the}} teeth out of alignment. Many people who <b>tongue</b> <b>thrust</b> have open bites; {{the force of the}} tongue against the teeth {{is an important factor in}} contributing to [...] "bad bite" [...] (malocclusion). Many orthodontists have completed dental treatment with what appeared to be good results, only to discover that the case relapsed because of the patient's <b>tongue</b> <b>thrust.</b> If the tongue is allowed to continue its pushing action against the teeth, it will continue to push the teeth forward and reverse the orthodontic work.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tongue</b> <b>thrust</b> (also called reverse swallow or {{immature}} swallow) is {{the common}} name of orofacial muscular imbalance, a human behavioral pattern in which the tongue protrudes through the anterior incisors during swallowing, speech, and while the tongue is at rest.

The purpose of this descriptive research was to present the prevalence of oral habits in homeless children under care of Yayasan Bahtera Bandung, by survey technique. The sample consisted of 92 children collected by purposive sampling. This research was conducted through interviews and clinical examnations of the oral cavity to elucidate signs of oral habits. The result showed 50 % of homeless children performed oral habits, consisting of 26 boys (55, 32 %) and 20 girls (44. 44 %).

50|$|Extra teeth, lost teeth, {{impacted}} teeth, or abnormally shaped teeth {{have been}} cited as causes of malocclusion. A small underdeveloped jaw, caused by lack of masticatory stress during childhood, can cause tooth overcrowding. Ill-fitting dental fillings, crowns, appliances, retainers, or braces as well as misalignment of jaw fractures after a severe injury are other causes. Tumors of the mouth and jaw, thumb sucking, <b>tongue</b> <b>thrusting,</b> pacifier use beyond age 3, and prolonged use of a bottle have also been identified as causes.|$|R
50|$|Posterior open bite {{is caused}} when {{posterior}} teeth such as molars or premolars fail to touch their counterpart tooth. This {{is more likely}} to occur in segments where there may be unilateral open bite or open bite related to one or more teeth. Failure of eruption of teeth either due to primary failure or mechanical obstruction during eruption phase can cause the open bite. Sometimes lateral <b>tongue</b> <b>thrust</b> may also prevent the eruption of the posterior teeth, thus eliminating this habit maybe key to eruption in those instances.|$|E
50|$|From {{the dental}} perspective, teeth move in {{relation}} to the balance of the soft tissue; the normal relationship of teeth lies in occlusion; and any deviation from the normal occlusion can lead to dental distress. Tongue posture {{plays an important role in}} swallowing and dentofacial growth. In case of <b>tongue</b> <b>thrust</b> swallowing, the tip of the tongue can come against or between the dentition; the midpoint may be collapsed or extended unilaterally or bilaterally; or the posterior part of the hard palate. In these conditions, there are chances of abnormal dentofacial growth and other concerns regarding development of the craniofacial complex.|$|E
50|$|Tongue {{thrusting}} {{is a type}} of orofacial myofunctional disorder, {{which is}} defined as habitual resting or thrusting the tongue forward and/or sideways against or between the teeth while swallowing, chewing, resting, or speaking. Abnormal swallowing patterns push the upper teeth forward and away from the upper alveolar processes and cause open bites. In children, tongue thrusting is common due to immature oral behavior, narrow dental arch, prolonged upper respiratory tract infections, spaces between the teeth (diastema), muscle weakness, malocclusion, abnormal sucking habits, and open mouth posture due to structural abnormalities of genetic origin. Large tonsils and adenoids also contribute to <b>tongue</b> <b>thrust</b> swallowing.|$|E
