5|$|M-149 is a rural two-lane {{highway that}} {{starts in the}} {{community}} of Thompson southwest of Manistique on Lake Michigan. It runs west-northwesterly through woodlands away from a junction with US2 along a small pond in the area. The road curves to the north and passes the cemetery and some small farms south of a crossing with a line of the Canadian National Railway. North of the tracks, the road meets County Road 442 (CR442) near Indian Lake. M-149 <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west at that junction while CR442 runs easterly to connect to the main unit of the Indian Lake State Park. The highway continues to a junction with CR455, which connects to the western unit of the state part, after which the trunkline <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest through forested terrain. The highway turns back to the west before intersecting another CR442 in the area.

Where Aristotle expanded on grand theories, Theophrastus was quietly empirical.

The route heads into more commercial areas again before passing urban residences, coming to an intersection that provides access to the Pulaski Skyway. Here, US1-9 Truck turns east on Broadway, running through a business district. A short distance later, it turns north onto an unnamed road with County Route 642 continuing east on Broadway. The route passes under a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line and PATH's Newark – World Trade Center Line before crossing under the Pulaski Skyway. Immediately after, US1-9 Truck intersects the eastern terminus of Route 7 and <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, with County Route 645 continuing north at this intersection. The truck route becomes a four-lane divided highway called the St. Paul's Viaduct that runs {{to the north of the}} Pulaski Skyway and passes through industrial sectors, crossing over a Conrail railroad line and County Route 646. A short distance later, US1-9 Truck comes to the Tonnele Circle with US1-9 and Route 139, where it ends.|$|E
