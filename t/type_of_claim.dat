[...] Many mapping techniques have a relatively low resolution, including hundreds of thousands of neurons in a single voxel. [...] Many functions also involve multiple parts of the brain, meaning that this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> is probably both unverifiable with the equipment used, and generally based on an incorrect assumption about how brain functions are divided. [...] It may be that most brain functions will only be described correctly after being measured with much more fine-grained measurements that look not at large regions but instead at {{a very large number of}} tiny individual brain circuits. [...] Many of these studies also have technical problems like small sample size or poor equipment calibration which means they cannot be reproduced - considerations which are sometimes ignored to produce a sensational journal article or news headline. [...] In some cases the brain mapping techniques are used for commercial purposes, lie detection, or medical diagnosis in ways which have not been scientifically validated.|$|E

However, this assumption may not be realistic: several {{studies have shown that}} there is a positive correlation between <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim.</b> Here we introduce different multivariate Poisson regression models in order to relax the independence assumption, including zero-inflated models to account for excess of zeros and overdispersion. These models have been largely ignored to date, mainly because of their computational difficulties. Bayesian inference based on MCMC helps to resolve this problem (and also allows us to derive, for several quantities of interest, posterior summaries to account for uncertainty). Finally, these models are applied to an automobile insurance claims database with three different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim.</b> We analyse the consequences for pure and loaded premiums when the independence assumption is relaxed by using different multivariate Poisson regression models together with their zero-inflated versions.

40|$|Conscience and {{conscientious}} objections {{are important}} issues in medical law and ethics. However, discussions {{tend to focus}} on a particular <b>type</b> <b>of</b> conscience-based <b>claim.</b> These <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> are based upon predictable, generalizable rules in which an individual practitioner objects to what is otherwise standard medical treatment (for example, the objections recognised in the Abortion Act). However, not all conscience based <b>claims</b> are <b>of</b> this <b>type.</b> There are other claims which are based not on an objection to a treatment in general but in individual cases.

This paper will explore these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> conscience-based <b>claims</b> in two ways. First, it will explore whether these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> individualised conscience-based <b>claims</b> are really conscience claims at all.

5000|$|The Supreme Court sustained, however, Morse's {{claim to}} such {{telecommunication}} when effectuated {{by means of}} Morse's inventive [...] "repeater" [...] apparatus. This was an electrical circuit in which a cascade of many sets comprising a relay and a battery were connected in series, so that when each relay closed, it closed a circuit to cause the next battery to power the succeeding relay, as suggested in the accompanying figure. This caused Morse's signal to pass along the cascade without degrading into noise as its amplitude decreased with the distance traveled. (Each time the amplitude of the signal approaches the noise level, the repeater effect, a nonlinear amplifier boosts the signal amplitude well above the noise level.) This use of [...] "repeaters" [...] permitted a message {{to be sent to}} great distances, which was previously not feasible.The Supreme Court thus held that Morse could properly claim a patent monopoly on the system or process of transmitting signals at any distance by means of the repeater circuitry indicated above, but he could not properly claim a monopoly over any and all uses of electromagnetic force to transmit signals. The apparatus limitation in the former <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> limited the patent monopoly to what Morse taught and gave the world. The lack of that limitation in the latter <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> (i.e., claim 8) both gave Morse more than was commensurate with what he had contributed to society and discouraged the inventive efforts of others who might come up with different and/or better ways to send signals at a distance using the electromagnetic force.|$|E
5000|$|... "Wrongful death" [...] is a {{cause of}} action, or <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim,</b> that can be brought when one person or entity {{wrongful}}ly causes someone's death. It allows a lawsuit to be filed even though {{the person who was}} harmed is no longer alive to bring the case. Typically, each state has its own wrongful death statute, and although the details of the statutes vary significantly from state to state, most {{can be traced back to}} Lord Campbell's Act, passed by the United Kingdom's Parliament in 1864. In some states, the family of the decedent must bring two different types of claims: a [...] "wrongful death" [...] claim to recover the [...] "full value of the life" [...] of the deceased, and a claim on behalf of the decedent's estate to recover for funeral expenses, pain and suffering, or punitive damages.|$|E

40|$|Insurance {{companies}} typically face {{multiple sources}} (<b>types)</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims.</b> Therefore, modeling dependencies among different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> risks {{is extremely important}} for evaluating the aggregate <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> an insurer. In {{the first part of}} this thesis, we consider three classes of bivariate counting distributions and the corresponding compound distributions introduced in a 1996 paper by Hesselager. We implement the recursive methods for computing the joint probability functions derived by Hesselager and then compare the results with those obtained from fast Fourier transform (FFT) methods. In applying the FFT methods, we extend the concept of exponential tilting for univariate FFT proposed by Grubel and Hermesmeier to the bivariate case. Our numerical results show that although the recursive methods yield the exact compound distributions if the floating-point representation error is ignored, they generally consume more computation time than the FFT methods. On the other hand, although FFT methods are in general very fast, they suffer from the so called alias error. However, the alias error can be effectively reduced via the introduced exponential tilting. Therefore, the FFT methods constitute viable alternatives to the recursive methods for computing the joint probabilities. In the second part of the thesis, we introduce a multivariate aggregate claims model, which allows dependencies among claim numbers as well as dependencies among claim sizes. This model makes practical sense because insurance companies typically write multi lines (<b>types)</b> <b>of</b> insurance policies and the claims from different lines of businesses are usually dependent. For example, in auto insurance, insurance companies have to pay claims due to property damages and bodily injuries. The numbers <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> from property damages and bodily injuries are typically dependent. In addition, one would expect that the sizes <b>of</b> the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> are dependent because some accidents cause two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> simultaneously. For this proposed model, we derive recursive formulas for the joint probability functions <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims.</b> In addition, we show that the concepts of exponential tilting in the multivariate FFT can be applied to compute the joint probability functions <b>of</b> the various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> in the introduced multivariate aggregate claims model. Numerical examples are provided to compare the accuracy and efficiency of the two computation methods. In the third part of the thesis, we apply a moment-based technique to approximate the distribution of univariate and bivariate aggregate claims. The numerical examples presented herein indicate that the proposed approximation method constitutes another viable alternative to the recursive and FFT methods...|$|R
40|$|Plaintiffs {{commonly}} bring {{two distinct}} <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> under Section 1 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 : 1) <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> material misrepresentations or omissions; and 2) <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> trade-based market manipulation. Despite the distinctive features <b>of</b> the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims,</b> courts {{have tended to}} treat them identically when applying the “fraud on the market” doctrine. In particular, courts have required both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> plaintiffs to make identical showings that the relevant security traded in an “efficient market” {{in order to gain}} a presumption of reliance. The reasons for requiring such a showing by plaintiffs in a misrepresentation case are, however, inapplicable in market manipulation cases. Plaintiffs alleging market manipulation should not be required to demonstrate an efficient market in order to benefit from the fraud on the market doctrine’s presumption of reliance.
