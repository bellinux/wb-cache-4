5|$|A book {{published}} in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted the account {{as given by}} U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed {{at the beginning of}} the raid. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>SEALs</b> jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards <b>the</b> <b>SEALs.</b> She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as <b>the</b> <b>SEALs</b> went past her. Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of a bedroom door, saw <b>the</b> <b>SEALs,</b> and slammed the door closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden ran up the stairs to the third floor and was killed with two shots.|$|E
5|$|An {{intelligence}} official told Seymour Hersh in 2015 that no fire-fight took place. In the earlier versions, Al-Kuwaiti {{is said to}} have opened fire on the first team of SEALs with an AK-47 from behind the guesthouse door, lightly injuring a SEAL with bullet fragments. A short firefight took place between al-Kuwaiti and <b>the</b> <b>SEALs,</b> in which al-Kuwaiti was killed. His wife Mariam was allegedly shot and wounded in the right shoulder. The courier's male relative Abrar was then said to have been shot and killed by the SEALs' second team {{on the first floor of}} the main house as shots had already been fired and <b>the</b> <b>SEALs</b> thought that he was armed with a loaded AK-47 (this was later confirmed to be true in the official report). A woman near him, later identified as Abrar's wife Bushra, was in this version also shot and killed. Bin Laden's young adult son {{is said to have}} encountered <b>the</b> <b>SEALs</b> on the staircase of the main house, and to have been shot and killed by the second team. An unnamed U.S. senior defense official stated that only one of the five people killed, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, was armed. The interior of the house was pitch dark, because CIA operatives had cut the power to the neighborhood. However, <b>the</b> <b>SEALs</b> wore night vision goggles.|$|E
5|$|As they hovered {{above the}} target, however, the first {{helicopter}} experienced a hazardous airflow condition {{known as a}} vortex ring state. This was aggravated by higher than expected air temperature ("a so-called 'hot and high' environment") and the high compound walls, which stopped the rotor downwash from diffusing. The helicopter's tail grazed one of the compound's walls, damaging its tail rotor, and the helicopter rolled onto its side. The pilot quickly buried the aircraft's nose {{to keep it from}} tipping over. None of <b>the</b> <b>SEALs,</b> crew and pilots on the helicopter were seriously injured in the soft crash landing, which ended with it pitched at a 45-degree angle resting against the wall. The other helicopter landed outside the compound and <b>the</b> <b>SEALs</b> scaled the walls to get inside. <b>The</b> <b>SEALs</b> advanced into the house, breaching walls and doors with explosives.|$|E
50|$|Several {{variants}} of <b>the</b> <b>Seal</b> of Quality exist: <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> alone, <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> {{with a green}} ribbon and the passage COMMISSIONER'S CHOICE, <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> with <b>the</b> passage AGRICULTURAL PARTNER, <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> with <b>the</b> passage FARM HERITAGE PARTNER, and <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> with <b>the</b> passage VALUE-ADDED PRODUCT.|$|R

5|$|Drakengard 2 {{takes place}} in an unnamed land nearly two decades after the events of Drakengard: {{originally}} said to take place after the game's first ending, it was later retconned so it took place in an isolated timeline following events similar to Drakengard. In the original game, two powers, the Empire and the Union, {{were engaged in a}} religious war over <b>the</b> <b>Seals,</b> magical bindings tied to a chosen Goddess of the Seal that kept dark entities known as the Watchers from appearing in the mortal world and destroying humanity. Caught up in the conflict were Caim and Angelus, a human and a dragon who had made a pact (a magical ritual that linked their souls), and fought to try to keep both <b>the</b> <b>Seals</b> and the Goddess safe. Though they ultimately failed, Angelus became the new seal, averting the end of the world. Eighteen years later, <b>the</b> <b>Seals</b> are protected by the Knights of the Seal, who eventually grow to become a dominating force in the land.|$|E

5|$|NOAA {{cultivated}} {{a network}} of volunteers to protect <b>the</b> <b>seals</b> while they bask or bear and nurse their young. NOAA is funding considerable research on seal population dynamics and health {{in conjunction with the}} Marine Mammal Center. From NOAA, several programs and networks were formed in order monk seal. Community programs such as PIRO have helped to improve community standards for the Hawaiian monk seal. The program also creates networks with the Native Hawaiians on the island to network more people in the fight for conservation of <b>the</b> <b>seals.</b> The Marine Mammal Response Network (MMRN) is partnered with NOAA and several other government agencies that deal with land and marine wildlife.|$|E
40|$|A sealing {{construct}} for a {{space environment}} includes a seal-bearing object, a <b>seal</b> on <b>the</b> seal-bearing object, and a seal-engaging object. <b>The</b> <b>seal</b> includes a seal body having a sealing surface, and a textured pattern at <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> surface, <b>the</b> textured pattern defining {{at least one}} shaded channel surface. The seal-engaging object is selectively engaged with the seal-bearing object through <b>the</b> <b>seal.</b> <b>The</b> seal-engaging object has a sealing surface, wherein, when the seal-engaging object is selectively engaged with the seal-bearing object, <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> surface of <b>the</b> seal-engaging object engages <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> surface of <b>the</b> <b>seal,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> is compressed between the seal-bearing object and the seal-engaging object such {{that at least one}} shaded channel surface engages <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> surface of <b>the</b> seal-engaging object...|$|R

40|$|A {{specially}} configured {{seal system}} (see figure) {{has been developed}} and produced that provides a barrier to gas leakage between a pressurized module and its external environment. <b>The</b> <b>seal</b> system includes a shroud covering that both protects <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> surface from its environment {{when not in use}} and retracts to expose <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> surface when engaged. <b>The</b> <b>seal</b> system is constructed and arranged to mate with a replicate seal system or with a flat surface. When mated with a replicate <b>seal</b> system, <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> system functions when <b>the</b> two <b>sealing</b> surfaces are aligned or misaligned. <b>The</b> <b>seal</b> system can operate over a wide range of temperatures, limited only by the glass transition and melt temperatures of the material from which <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> surface is manufactured...|$|R

5|$|Two SEALs {{broke through}} the bedroom door. Bin Laden's wife Amal was {{on the edge of}} the bed {{shouting}} in Arabic at <b>the</b> <b>SEALs,</b> and Osama bin Laden dived across the bed, shoving Amal at the same time, for an AKS-74U kept by the headboard. <b>The</b> <b>SEALs</b> fired four shots at bin Laden; the first missed, the second grazed Amal in the calf also missing bin Laden, and the final two hit bin Laden in the chest and head, killing him instantly. In Pfarrer's account, the total time elapsed from jumping on the roof to Osama bin Laden's death was between 30 and 90 seconds.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1967â€“68 NHL season, Plante received a call from his ex-teammate Bert Olmstead seeking some help coaching the expansion Oakland Seals. Plante coached mainly by example, and after the three-week training camp he returned home to Montreal. Plante also played an exhibition game with <b>the</b> <b>Seals.</b> Rumours swirled that Plante was planning a comeback.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>seal</b> {{construction}} {{will consist}} of a sprung main sealing lip which has a point contact with the shaft. The point contact is formed by two angles, with the air side angle usually less than the oil side angle. Depending on <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> type these two angles are varied to create a pressure distribution at <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> contact point which has a steeper slope on the oil side of <b>the</b> <b>seal.</b> <b>The</b> shallower the slope on the oil side of <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> wetter <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> will run. <b>The</b> spring is positioned such that axially the centerline of the spring is biased to the air side of the lip contact point.|$|R

5|$|Over 80 {{per cent}} of <b>the</b> <b>seals</b> {{attributed}} to Maaibre Sheshi are of unknown provenance, but the remaining 20 per cent {{have been found}} throughout Egypt, Nubia and Canaan, indicating widespread trade and diplomatic contacts during Sheshi's reign.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> main <b>seal</b> is <b>the</b> IX <b>seal</b> ring. <b>The</b> <b>seal</b> ring {{force is}} {{provided}} by the elastic stored energy in <b>the</b> stressed <b>seal</b> ring. Any heel leakage will give internal pressure acting on <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> ring inside intensifying <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> action. This however requires the IX ring to be retained in the theoretical location in the ring groove which is difficult to ensure and verify during installation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{performance}} of Vane hydraulic damp O-ring seal,simulation about <b>the</b> O-ring <b>seal</b> was applied by nonlinear finite element analysis method. <b>The</b> factors influencing <b>sealing</b> performance are considered, such as initial compressibility, <b>sealing</b> materials. Applying <b>the</b> method, <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> structure was designed and optimized. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> performance was improved, and the contract pressure was increased. The finite element analysis method can be effectively used to solve nonlinear material and sealing failure problem for <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> design, optimization and performance analysis, which provide a new approach and theoretical guidance to <b>the</b> rubber <b>seal</b> research. <b>The</b> <b>seal</b> material and compression ratio are both great influence on <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> performance, which should be based on working conditions to select <b>the</b> appropriate <b>sealing</b> materials...|$|R
5|$|The Drakengard games {{take place}} in a dark fantasy version of Medieval Europe called Midgard. Humans appear to be the {{predominant}} species, although races such as dragons, fairies and elves are shown to exist. The setting, mythos and landscape borrow extensively from the lore of Northern Europe. The world is overseen by a group of unnamed gods who have yet to make a personal appearance. The gods are served by beings known as the Watchers, entities created to destroy humanity because they are considered a failure. The Watchers are kept from entering the world with <b>the</b> <b>seals,</b> which act to keep the world in balance: should <b>the</b> <b>seals</b> be destroyed, the Watchers would enter the world and destroy humanity. At the core of <b>the</b> <b>seals</b> is the Goddess of the Seal, a mortal virgin female chosen and branded with the final seal: if all <b>the</b> <b>seals</b> are destroyed, all that stands between the Watchers and the world is the death of the Goddess herself. A core element of the Drakengard universe is the ability for humans and beasts to form a Pact, a magical bond which links their souls and grants the human partner great power at the cost of some physical ability or personal trait (their voice, singing abilities, etc.). Pacts are normally entered into by beasts so they can feed off negative emotions, but sometimes they will enter a pact for other reasons. A recurring element across the series is the representation of magic using the Celestial Alphabet, with a common letter arrangement representing the human gene.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere, Bart is {{not ready}} for the {{upcoming}} Springfield Elementary science fair. He ends up working with Martin Prince and after Bart {{comes up with a}} general ideaâ€”cool roboticsâ€”Martin does all the work and constructs an adorable robotic baby seal. However, it is revealed that when the wiring is tampered with, they become violent attackers. The seal wins first prize at the Fair, to Lisa's disdain. When she goes to the Springfield Retirement Castle to whine about the injustice to Grampa, the seniors citizen see the seal visibly cheer up Jasper and the value of the invention becomes clear. All of the senior citizens then get their own seals, and they become happier and healthier, which angers a consortium of local businesses (led by the local funeral home) who want the oldsters to go back to being miserable and more rapidly dying. The group figures out the wiring secret and reworks <b>the</b> <b>seals</b> so their fury returns, even causing the death of Mrs. Glick. Chief Wiggum has all the robots impounded. Bart and Martin enlist the aid of Professor Frink who then gets a larger group of nerds to remotely hack into the robot software and make them nice again. They succeed and as a result, Chief Wiggum releases all <b>the</b> <b>seals,</b> who return to the nursing home.|$|E
25|$|Many people erroneously {{believe that}} <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> is changed {{during times of}} war, so that the eagle faces the arrows in its left talon. This belief may have arisen because major changes to <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> have coincidentally been made before or after wars â€“ specifically, the 1945 change in <b>the</b> <b>seal,</b> and also <b>the</b> 1916 change in the flag (though not <b>the</b> <b>seal)</b> from <b>the</b> right-facing Great <b>Seal</b> to <b>the</b> left-facing presidential <b>seal.</b>|$|R

5|$|Entanglement {{can result}} in {{mortality}} because when <b>the</b> <b>seals</b> get trapped in marine debris such as fishing nets they cannot maneuver or reach the surface to breathe. Marine fisheries can potentially interact with monk seals via direct and indirect relationships. Directly the seal can become snared by fishing equipment, entangled in discarded debris, and even feed on fish refuse. International law prohibits the intentional discarding of debris from ships at sea. Monk seals {{have one of the}} highest documented rates of entanglement of any pinniped species.|$|E
5|$|Heraldry {{developed}} in medieval Europe {{from the late}} 11th century, originally as a system of personal badges of the warrior classes, which served, among other purposes, as identification on the battlefield. The same insignia were used on seals to identify documents. The earliest seals bore a likeness of {{the owner of the}} seal, with the shield and heraldic insignia included. Over time, <b>the</b> <b>seals</b> were reduced to just the shield.|$|E
