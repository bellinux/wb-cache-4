2500|$|A bone {{anchored}} {{hearing aid}} (BAHA) is an auditory prosthetic based on bone conduction {{which can be}} surgically implanted. It is an option for patients without external ear canals, when conventional hearing aids with a mould in the ear cannot be used. The BAHA uses the skull as a pathway for sound {{to travel to the}} inner ear. [...] For people with conductive hearing loss, the BAHA bypasses <b>the</b> <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canal</b> and middle ear, stimulating the functioning cochlea. [...] For people with unilateral hearing loss, the BAHA uses the skull to conduct the sound from the deaf side to the side with the functioning cochlea.|$|E
2500|$|Barotrauma {{can affect}} the external, middle, or inner ear. [...] Middle ear {{barotrauma}} (MEBT) {{is the most common}} being experienced by between 10% and 30% of divers and is due to insufficient equilibration of the middle ear. [...] External ear barotrauma may occur on ascent if high pressure air is trapped in <b>the</b> <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canal</b> either by tight fitting diving equipment or ear wax. [...] Inner ear barotrauma (IEBT), though much less common than MEBT, shares a similar mechanism. [...] Mechanical trauma to the inner ear can lead to varying degrees of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss as well as vertigo. It is also common for conditions affecting the inner ear to result in auditory hypersensitivity.|$|E

50|$|Ceruminous glands are {{specialized}} sudoriferous glands (sweat glands) located subcutaneously in <b>the</b> <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canal,</b> in {{the outer}} 1/3. Ceruminous glands are simple, coiled, tubular glands made up of an inner secretory layer of cells and an outer myoepithelial layer of cells. They are classed as apocrine glands. The glands drain into larger ducts, which then drain into the guard hairs that reside in <b>the</b> <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canal.</b> Here they produce cerumen, or earwax, by mixing their secretion with sebum and dead epidermal cells. Cerumen keeps the eardrum pliable, lubricates and cleans <b>the</b> <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canal,</b> waterproofs the canal, kills bacteria, {{and serves as a}} barrier to trap foreign particles (dust, fungal spores, etc.) by coating the guard hairs of the ear, making them sticky.|$|E

40|$|Speech {{collected}} {{through a}} microphone {{placed in front}} of the mouth has been the primary source of data collection for speech recognition. There are only a few speech recognition studies using speech collected from the human ear canal. In this study, a speech recognition system is presented, specifically an isolated word recognizer which uses speech collected from <b>the</b> <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canals</b> of <b>the</b> subjects via an in-ear microphone. Currently, the vocabulary is limited to seven words that can be used as control commands {{for a wide variety of}} applications. The speech segmentation task is achieved by using the short-time signal energy parameter and the short-time energy-entropy feature (EEF), and by incorporating some heuristic assumptions. Multi-layer feedforward neural networks with two-layer and three-layer network configurations are selected for the word recognition task and use real cepstrum (RC) and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) extracted from each segmented utterance as characteristic features for the word recognizer. Results show that the neural network configurations investigated are viable choices for this specific recognition task as the average recognition rates obtained with the MFCCs as input features for the two-layer and three-layer networks are 94. 731 % and 94. 61 % respectively on the data investigated.
