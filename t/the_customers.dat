5|$|The series {{features}} customers, usually two {{to three}} per episode, bringing in anything they believe is resalable within reason to the dealership to help {{cover the cost of}} a new or used vehicle (including pigs, maple syrup, and collectable dolls), rather than paying for it with cash. <b>The</b> <b>customers</b> then negotiate the value of their items, usually with Gardner, but occasionally also {{with other members of the}} shop's staff. The trade usually is not enough to cover the full value of the car or truck; because of this, the value of the trade provides <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> with a down payment on the vehicle. Once the trade is completed, Todd, Darcy, and Travis take the items the dealership has acquired and attempt to resell them for a profit.|$|E

5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures {{were taken in}} response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, the power grid {{was taken out of}} commission, as circuit breakers tripped all over Quebec and shut off the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire transmission grid out of service. The collapsed power grid left six million people and the rest of Quebec without electricity for hours on a very cold night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for most places, some locations were in the dark for days. This geomagnetic storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-Québec and tens of millions to <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> of the utility.|$|E
5|$|After {{weeks of}} secret {{negotiations}} between merchants and protest leaders, an agreement was finally reached {{during the first}} week of May. According to the agreement, small, selected groups of African Americans would order food at the downtown lunch counters on a day known in advance to the merchants. The merchants would prepare their employees for the event and instruct them to serve <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> without trouble. This arrangement would continue in a controlled manner for a couple of weeks and then all controls would be taken off, at which point the merchants and protest leaders would reconvene to evaluate the results. Also as part of the agreement, the media was to be informed of the settlement and requested to provide only accurate, non-sensational coverage.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{building}} was a crane for ironware handling. When the frames were taken in, they were fitted with suspension and axles, and then turned the right way up. The next parts were the engine and transmission components. The final part for lorries was a pre-assembled cabin. Conventional bus chassis were delivered with bonnet and wings, but the forward control types left the factory without any body parts. After being painted, the vehicles left the assembly hall. Finally, every vehicle was tested on a -long test run on different roads and with various loads. The bus chassis were tested in a similar way; because there was no body, the drivers only had warm clothes and driving goggles to protect them against the weather conditions. The vehicles were handed over to <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> after final adjustments.|$|E

After hesitating, Swinscow admitted that he earned the money working as a prostitute for a man named Charles Hammond, who operated a male brothel at 19 Cleveland Street. According to Swinscow, he was introduced to Hammond by a General Post Office clerk, eighteen-year-old Henry Newlove. In addition, he named two seventeen-year-old telegraph boys who also worked for Hammond: George Alma Wright and Charles Ernest Thickbroom. Constable Hanks obtained corroborating statements from Wright and Thickbroom and, armed with these, a confession from Newlove.|$|E
5|$|On 16 December 1999, NSB {{confirmed}} the option for another six Class 73 trains, costing NOK680 million, {{for use on}} the Østfold Line. On 7 January 2000, the trains were put into service on the Dovre Line between Oslo and Trondheim, and on the Sørland Line between Kristiansand and Stavanger. The travel time from Trondheim to Oslo was 5 hours and 46 minutes. In an independent marketing survey, Signatur customers were more satisfied than <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> for the two main airlines, Braathens and Scandinavian Airlines, but the train service had a lower reputation than the airlines. By May, the number of passengers on the Sørland Line had fallen by 10 percent. The reason was the limited capacity during the weekends; while NSB had previously run trains with 400 to 500 seats, Class 73 had considerably less capacity. Additional services were introduced on the Dovre Line from 11 June 2000, while the introduction on the Bergen Line was delayed because the infrastructure upgrades on the Bergen Line were not yet completed.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the European population before industrialization lived in rural communities or isolated farms and households. The norm was self-sufficiency with {{only a small percentage}} of production being exported or sold in markets. Large towns were exceptions and required their surrounding hinterlands to support them with food and fuel. The dense urban population could support a wide variety of food establishments that catered to various social groups. Many of the poor city dwellers had to live in cramped conditions without access to a kitchen or even a hearth, and many did not own the equipment for basic cooking. Food from vendors was in such cases the only option. Cookshops could either sell ready-made hot food, an early form of fast food, or offer cooking services while <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> supplied some or all of the ingredients. Travellers, such as pilgrims en route to a holy site, made use of professional cooks to avoid having to carry their provisions with them. For the more affluent, there were many types of specialist that could supply various foods and condiments: cheesemongers, pie bakers, saucers, waferers, etc. Well-off citizens who had the means to cook at home could on special occasions hire professionals when their own kitchen or staff could not handle the burden of throwing a major banquet.|$|E
