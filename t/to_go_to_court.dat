25|$|However, {{with the}} {{colonization}} of Rwanda {{and the arrival}} of western systems of law, Rwandan society soon began to change as a whole. With this implementation and usage of western legal systems, Rwandans began <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> deal with their disputes. In turn, kings and wisemen soon began to lose their legitimacy within Rwandan society. And with this loss of legitimacy, Gacaca <b>courts</b> began <b>to</b> dwindle down in numbers.|$|R

25|$|With the {{expiration}} of the group's contract, SM Entertainment offered them a second contract {{but did not}} include one member, Dong-wan. Other Shinhwa's members especially the leader, Eric, disagreed and took action to reject it and signed with a new company, Good Entertainment. However, they had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> to retain {{the use of their}} name, which they won and duly moved from SM Entertainment to Good Entertainment. Because the contract with Good Entertainment did not begin until 2004, Shinhwa members pursued solo activities in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Arguably, either {{position}} is potentially unfair; {{if a person}} is made to sign a contract under duress, and the contract contains an arbitration clause highly favourable to the other party, the dispute may still referred to that arbitration tribunal. Conversely a court may be persuaded that the arbitration agreement itself is void having been signed under duress. However, most courts will be reluctant to interfere with the general rule which does allow for commercial expediency; any other solution (where one first had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> to decide whether one had to go to arbitration) would be self-defeating.|$|E
25|$|On 14 May 2012, an Indian {{news channel}} India TV aired a sting {{operation}} that accused five players involved in spot fixing.

25|$|John becomes greatly angered, {{tearing the}} arrest warrant to shreds and {{threatening}} Herrick and Cheever with a musket until Elizabeth calms {{him down and}} surrenders herself. He calls Hale a coward and asks him why the accusers' every utterance goes unchallenged. Hale is conflicted, but suggests that perhaps this misfortune has befallen Salem because of a great, secret crime that must be brought to light. Taking this to heart, John orders Mary <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> with him and expose the other girls' lies, but she refuses. Aware of John's affair, she warns him that Abigail is willing to expose it if necessary. John is shocked but determines the truth must prevail, whatever the personal cost.|$|E

Mary retorts that she saved Elizabeth's life that day, as Elizabeth was accused of witchcraft and was to be arrested until Mary spoke in her defense. Mary refuses to identify Elizabeth's accuser, but Elizabeth surmises accurately {{that it must have}} been Abigail. She implores John <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> and tell the judges that Abigail {{and the rest of the}} girls are pretending. John is reluctant, fearing that doing so will require him to publicly reveal his past adultery.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Tafari was {{diagnosed}} with hepatitis C. As he was poor he had no US health insurance, and was therefore unable to have his condition treated. He was also however, a UK citizen. He resigned his position as CEO of Dignity Village and returned to London to receive medical treatment under the English National Health Service (NHS). Homeless at first, he took advantage of English squatting laws to secure temporary housing for himself and sometimes others. These laws, which originated in the middle ages, allowed for unoccupied buildings to be taken over as temporary housing by those in need. During this period Tafari honed his squatting skills in three areas: the ‘scouting’ of suitable squats; ‘cracking’ squats (gaining entry); and ‘legally filing’ (registering) squats, such that property owners would have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> to secure evictions by means of interim possession orders.|$|E

25|$|The legislature's vote to {{fold the}} TBTA into {{the newly created}} Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) could {{technically}} {{have led to a}} lawsuit by the TBTA bondholders, since the bond contracts were written into state law it was unconstitutional to impair existing contractual obligations, as the bondholders had the right of approval over such actions. However, the largest holder of TBTA bonds, and thus agent for all the others, was the Chase Manhattan Bank, headed then by David Rockefeller, the governor's brother. No suit was filed. Moses could have directed TBTA <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> against the action, but having been promised a role in the merged authority, Moses declined to challenge the merger. On March 1, 1968, the TBTA was folded into the MTA and Moses gave up his post as chairman of the TBTA. He eventually became a consultant to the MTA, but its new chairman and the governor froze him out—the promised role did not materialize, and for all practical purposes Moses was out of power.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{concerns}} expressed {{to his office}} in November 2007 that there were actions underway to overwrite email tapes and the Governor's Office was not complying with the Sunshine Law, AG Jay Nixon appointed special investigators on November 15 to study what was taking place. Nixon's team had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> {{in the spring of}} 2008 to get a ruling on whether the governor's office was required to comply with their requests for information, {{at the expense of the}} state. Through various legal maneuverings, the court ruled in favor of the investigation, appointing two Special Attorneys General to lead it. The governor never was deposed. Eventually the completion of the investigation was extended to February 2009 because of the volume of materials that needed to be reviewed. The Kansas City Star, St. Louis Post-Dispatch and Associated Press filed petitions in August 2008 as intervening plaintiffs to gain preliminary and injunctive relief, declaratory judgment that the emails were public records under the state Sunshine Law, and access to the emails under discussion.|$|E

The final inquiry report, released on June 18, 2010, concluded that the RCMP were not justified in using a taser against Mr. Dziekański and that the officers later deliberately misrepresented their actions to investigators.|$|R
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Conan O'Brien and {{directed}} by Wes Archer.

The pair were intended to start fighting and end up having <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>court.</b> Despite O'Brien and other production staff being sure that Rickles would appear in the episode, he was reportedly upset by {{the concept of the}} storyline, as he did not wish to be portrayed as a [...] "mean guy".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, David Zinc starts {{taking his}} own legal initiatives. He stumbles upon a lead {{poisoning}} brain damage case involving {{the child of}} Burmese immigrants. Expending his own time and resources on this case, Zinc gathers enough evidence that if only he can find {{the identity of the}} American company which imported the child's toxic toys from China he would have an [...] "open and shut" [...] tort case. Zinc also succeeds in representing immigrants in a labor law case, giving him an increasing confidence in his ability <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> and effectively represent clients. During the labor case, the employer attempts to have Finley & Figg's offices burned down and the would-be arsonist stumbles upon Oscar at the office. Oscar shoots him and adds an unnecessary debilitating shot that shatteres his leg. He is sued for using excessive force.|$|E

Jackson's older sister La Toya stated that she felt that Michael would not have wanted the film to have been released because he was not giving his all into his performances. In October 2009, Jackson's father, Joe, stated and had strongly insisted that the film [...] "is mostly body doubles" [...] and that [...] "the media is going to tear this movie apart" [...] because of it. TMZ stated that members of the Jackson family had felt that footage of [...] "Jackson" [...] in the film was not him but rather body double(s). However, Sony released a statement denying rumors that the film had rehearsal footage of Jackson body doubles, describing the story as [...] "pure garbage".|$|E
50|$|In New England, slave women <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> {{gain their}} freedom while free black women <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> hold onto theirs; the New England legal system was unique in its {{accessibility}} to free blacks {{and the availability}} of attorneys.

In New England in 1716, Joan Jackson became the first slave woman to win her freedom in a New England court.|$|R
