5|$|The wings {{were of a}} broad 55 m² (590ft²) {{area and}} had a span of 18 m (59ft 0⅝ in) with a {{straight}} leading edge which curved in a near-perfect semicircle into the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge.</b> The positions of the wing roots were offset. The leading edge wing root merged with {{the top of the}} fuselage and cockpit. As the wing extended backwards, by roughly two thirds, it declined downwards at a sharp angle so that the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> wing root ended nearly halfway {{down the side of the}} fuselage increasing the angle of incidence. This design feature was used on all future Dornier bomber designs, namely the Dornier Do 217. The <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> was faired into the round fuselage shape. The engine nacelle was also faired into the flaps. The extreme rear of the nacelle was hollow and allowed the flap with an attached vertical slot to fit into the cavity when deployed.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{radical and}} unusual shape, the {{airframe}} was built along traditional lines. Except {{for the most}} highly stressed parts, the whole structure was manufactured from standard grades of light alloy. The airframe was broken down {{into a number of}} major assemblies: the centre section, a rectangular box containing the bomb-bay and engine bays bounded by the front and rear spars and the wing transport joints; the intakes and centre fuselage; the front fuselage, incorporating the pressure cabin; the nose; the outer wings; the leading edges; the wing <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> and tail end of the fuselage; the wings were not sealed and used directly as fuel tankage, but carried bladders for fuel in the void spaces of the wings; and there was a single swept tail fin with a single rudder on the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} procedure {{has been developed}} for accurate 13; predictions of pressure distribution near sharp <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> of three-dimensional wings by applying a flow stagnation condition. The surface integral approach using quadrilateral where the geometry is smooth and continuous. 13; vortex panels with Neumann boundary condition has been used on real surfaces Auxiliary panels are introduced near sharp <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> to impose a stagnation condition at discontinuous points on the <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> resulting in better pressure distribution and more accurate prediction of induced drag. The flow {{is assumed to be}} steady, irrotational, inviscid and incompressible...|$|R
50|$|Fairey-Youngman {{pneumatic}} dive brakes were {{fitted to}} the wing <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> of several Beaufort IIs. After adverse reports from pilots these were locked shut. It {{was found that}} the curved alloy extensions on the <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> improved the flight characteristics and similar panels were fitted on all later production Beauforts.|$|R

5|$|In flight, {{the white}} {{lining of the}} underwings {{can be seen in}} {{contrast}} to the blackish underbody and upperside. The purple speculum lacks white bands at the front and rear, and rarely has a white <b>trailing</b> <b>edge.</b> A dark crescent is visible on the median underwing primary coverts.|$|E
5|$|The {{light alloy}} split flaps at the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> {{of the wing}} were also {{pneumatically}} operated via a finger lever on the instrument panel. Only two positions were available; fully up or fully down (85°). The flaps were normally lowered only during the final approach and for landing, and the pilot was to retract them before taxiing.|$|E
5|$|The adult female {{is mainly}} {{scalloped}} and mottled in light brown {{with a more}} uniformly grey-brown head, and its pointed tail is shorter than the male's; it is still easily identified by its shape, long neck, and long grey bill. In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake pintail looks similar to the female, but retains the male upperwing pattern and long grey shoulder feathers. Juvenile birds resemble the female, but are less neatly scalloped and have a duller brown speculum with a narrower <b>trailing</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|E
40|$|A turbine stage {{includes}} {{a row of}} airfoils joined to corresponding platforms to define flow passages therebetween. Each airfoil includes opposite pressure and suction sides and extends in chord between opposite leading and <b>trailing</b> <b>edges.</b> Each platform {{includes a}} crescentic ramp increasing in height from the leading and <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> toward the midchord of the airfoil along the pressure side thereof...|$|R
2500|$|The wing <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> carried flaps {{from the}} wing roots {{almost to the}} tips and these were blown with air bled from the {{centrifugal}} compressor of the Deltaviex's Turbomeca Marboré gas turbine engine, exiting the flap <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> via [...] holes. There were also more conventional ailerons, though they were unusual in that they were irregular quadrilaterals in shape and formed the wing tips.|$|R
2500|$|Nowhere in {{the patent}} {{is there a}} {{description}} of mounting the ailerons on the <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> of the airplane's wings, where they would have induced adverse yaw, but only [...] "...on arms projecting from the vessel laterally". Indeed, the first ailerons used by Robert Esnault-Pelterie in 1904 were mounted inter-wing, not on the <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> of the glider's wings where they would have created unequal aileron drag.|$|R
5|$|The <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> of the {{transmitter}} pulse was not perfectly sharp and caused the receiver signals to ring {{for a short}} time even if they were turned on after the pulse was ostensibly complete. This leftover signal caused a large permanent blip known as {{the transmitter}} break through which appeared at the short-range end of the tubes (left and bottom). A control known as the Oscillator Bias allowed the exact timing of the receiver's activation relative to the transmitter pulse to be adjusted, normally so the remains of the pulse were just visible.|$|E
5|$|Operational {{experience}} had found Blackburn's Firebrand strike fighter {{to be far}} from suited to carrier operations. In particular, the pilot sat near the wing's <b>trailing</b> <b>edge,</b> looking over a very long and wide nose which gave a particularly poor view for landing. The Firecrest had also been rendered obsolete {{by the arrival of}} gas turbine engines, and while Blackburn did draw up proposals for turboprop-powered derivatives of the Firecrest, (as the B-62 (Y.A.6) with the Armstrong Siddeley Python engine), these went unbuilt, with orders instead going to Westland for the Wyvern. The two flying prototypes remained in use until 1949, being sold back to Blackburn in 1950, and were later scrapped.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} mammals, and unlike in birds, the radius {{is the main}} {{component}} of the forearm. Bats have five elongated digits, which all radiate around the wrist. The thumb points forward and supports the leading edge, and the other digits support the tension held in the wing membrane. The second and third digits go along the wing tip, allowing the wing to be pulled forward against a strong drag force, without having to be thick like they were in pterosaur wings. The fourth and fifth digits go from the wrist to the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge,</b> and repel the bending force caused by air pushing up against the stiff membrane. Due to their flexible joints, bats are more manoeuvrable and more dextrous than gliding mammals.|$|E
50|$|The wing <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> carried flaps {{from the}} wing roots {{almost to the}} tips and these were blown with air bled from the {{centrifugal}} compressor of the Deltaviex's Turbomeca Marboré gas turbine engine, exiting the flap <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> via 700 μm in holes. There were also more conventional ailerons, though they were unusual in that they were irregular quadrilaterals in shape and formed the wing tips.|$|R

5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, hanging upside {{down from their}} feet. The femurs are {{attached}} at the hips {{in a way that}} allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. The ankle joint can flex so as to allow the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> of the wings to bend downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. This difference is reflected {{in the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when hanging from a roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.|$|E
5|$|One MiG-9 (izdeliye FK) was {{modified}} in 1949 {{to serve as}} a testbed for the Raduga KS-1 Komet air-launched anti-shipping cruise missile. A second unpressurized cockpit was built in line with the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> of the wing for the guidance system operator. The aircraft was fitted with two radars, a K-1M target illumination radar in a prominent bullet-shaped fairing above the air intakes and an aft-looking radar mounted in a cigar-shaped fairing {{at the top of the}} vertical stabilizer. This latter system was intended to test the mid-course guidance system of the launching aircraft and the guidance systems of the missile. Signals from the K-1M radar were received in small bullet-shaped fairings on the leading edges of the wings. The aircraft served in this role for four years, until the missile passed its state acceptance trials in 1952–53.|$|E
5|$|The TSR-2 {{was to be}} {{powered by}} two Bristol-Siddeley Olympus reheated turbojets, {{advanced}} variants of those used in the Avro Vulcan. The Olympus would be further developed and would power the supersonic Concorde. The design featured a small shoulder-mounted delta wing with down-turned tips, an all-moving swept tailplane and a large all-moving fin. Blown flaps were fitted across the entire <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> of the wing to achieve the short takeoff and landing requirement, something that later designs would achieve with the technically more complex swing-wing approach. No ailerons were fitted, control in roll instead being implemented by differential movement of the slab tailplanes. The wing loading was high for its time, enabling the aircraft to fly at very high speed and low level with great stability without being constantly upset by thermals and other ground-related weather phenomena. The EE Chief Test Pilot, Wing Commander Roland Beamont, favourably compared the TSR-2's supersonic flying characteristics to the Canberra's own subsonic flight characteristics, stating that the Canberra was more troublesome.|$|E
5000|$|The wing was a {{cantilever}} structure, {{without the}} lift struts to mid wing seen on most parasol winged aircraft. It had a constant chord centre section with outboard taper on both leading and <b>trailing</b> <b>edges.</b> The ailerons were short and wide chord, with curved <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> that projected {{beyond that of}} the wing. [...] Four sets of V and inverted-V struts attached the wing to the upper fuselage longerons.|$|R
50|$|An {{elliptical}} wing is a wing planform whose leading and <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> each approximate to {{segments of}} an ellipse.|$|R
40|$|Modifications, {{including}} {{incorporation of}} centrifugal casting, made in investment-casting process reducing scrap rate. Used to make first- and second-stage high-pressure-fuel-turbopump nozzles, containing vanes with thin <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> and other thin sections. Investment mold spun for short time while being filled, and stopped before solidification occurs. Centrifugal force drives molten metal into thin <b>trailing</b> <b>edges,</b> ensuring they are filled. With improved filling, preheat and pour temperatures reduced and solidification hastened so less hot tearing...|$|R
5|$|The YF-22 was {{designed}} to meet USAF requirements for survivability, supercruise, stealth, and ease of maintenance. Because Lockheed's submission was selected {{as one of the}} winners, the company, through its Skunk Works division, assumed leadership of the program partners. It would be responsible for the forward cockpit and fuselage, as well as final assembly at Palmdale, California. Meanwhile, the wings and aft fuselage would be built by Boeing, with the center fuselage, weapons bays, tail and landing gears built by General Dynamics. Compared with its Northrop/McDonnell Douglas counterpart, the YF-22 has a more conventional design – its wings have larger control surfaces, such as full-span <b>trailing</b> <b>edge,</b> and, whereas the YF-23 had two tail surfaces, the YF-22 had four, which made it more maneuverable than its counterpart. Two examples of each prototype air vehicle (PAV) were built for the Demonstration-Validation phase: one with General Electric YF120 engines, the other with Pratt & Whitney YF119 engines.|$|E
5|$|The {{avionics}} software {{incorporates the}} concept of open architecture. Instead of the military-optimised Ada programming language, the software is written using the popular C++ programming language, enabling {{the use of the}} numerous civilian programmers available. The aircraft also includes a health and usage monitoring system, and automatic test equipment. The flight control system (FCS) comprises conventional controls with stability augmentation in the yaw and roll axis and a digital fly-by-wire (FBW) system in the pitch axis. The leading edge slats/flaps and <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> flaps are automatically adjusted during manoeuvring to increase turning performance. The FCS of serial production aircraft reportedly have a digital quadruplex (quad-redundant) FBW system in the pitch axis and a duplex (dual-redundant) FBW system in the roll and yaw axis.|$|E
5|$|The broad, {{triangular}} pectoral fins originate {{below the}} third or fourth gill slits, and are no longer than the front margin of the first dorsal fin. The anal fin is about twice as long as the second dorsal fin and preceded by long ridges. The first dorsal fin originates over the pectoral fin free rear tips, and the much smaller second dorsal fin originates over the last third of the anal fin base. The dorsal fins do not have a ridge between them. The lower lobe of the caudal fin is well-developed and the upper lobe has a ventral notch near the tip. This shark is plain gray, brown-gray, or purple-gray above, and white below. The leading edge of the first dorsal fin and the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> of the caudal fin may be dark, and the trailing edges of the pectoral fins may be light.|$|E
50|$|In {{circulation}} control, {{near the}} <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> of wings, aircraft flight control systems {{are replaced by}} slots which emit fluid flows.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 8 mm. They have narrow wings, long hair scales on the <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> of {{the wings and}} sombre colours.|$|R
50|$|Any wing with {{straight}} leading and <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> and with differing root and tip chords is a trapezoid, {{whether or not}} it is swept.|$|R
5|$|The {{project was}} {{designed}} {{with a new}} methodology called fault tree analysis, which allowed {{the effects of a}} failure of a single part to be studied to determine its impact on other systems. To address concerns about safety and flyability, the 747's design included structural redundancy, redundant hydraulic systems, quadruple main landing gear and dual control surfaces. Additionally, some of the most advanced high-lift devices used in the industry were included in the new design, to allow it to operate from existing airports. These included slats running almost {{the entire length of the}} wing, as well as complex three-part slotted flaps along the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> of the wing. The wing's complex three-part flaps increase wing area by 21 percent and lift by 90 percent when fully deployed compared to their non-deployed configuration.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the wing was its washout. The <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> of the wing twisted {{slightly}} upward along its span, the angle of incidence decreasing from +2° at its root to -½° at its tip. This caused the wing roots to stall before the tips, reducing tip-stall that could otherwise {{have resulted in a}} wing drop, often leading to a spin. As the wing roots started to stall, the separating air stream started to buffet (vibrate) the aircraft, warning the pilot, and hence allowing even relatively inexperienced pilots to fly the aircraft to the limits of its performance. This washout was first featured in the wing of the Type 224 and became a consistent feature in subsequent designs leading to the Spitfire. The complexity of the wing design, especially the precision required to manufacture the vital spar and leading-edge structures, at first caused some major hold-ups in the production of the Spitfire. The problems increased when the work was put out to subcontractors, most of whom had never dealt with metal-structured, high-speed aircraft. By June 1939, most of these problems had been resolved, and production was no longer held up by a lack of wings.|$|E
5|$|The XF-104 had {{a radical}} wing design. Most {{supersonic}} jets use a swept or delta wing. This allows a reasonable balance between aerodynamic performance, lift, and internal space for fuel and equipment. However {{the most efficient}} shape for high-speed, supersonic flight had {{been found to be}} a small, straight, mid-mounted, trapezoidal wing of low aspect ratio and high wing loading. The wing was extremely thin, with a thickness-to-chord ratio of only 3.4%. The leading edges of the wing were so thin (0.016in/0.41mm) and so sharp that they presented a hazard to ground crews, and protective guards had to be installed during ground operations. The thinness of the wings meant that fuel tanks and landing gear had to be contained in the fuselage. The hydraulic actuators driving the ailerons were only one inch (25mm) thick to fit into the available space and were known as Piccolo actuators because of their resemblance to this musical instrument. The wings had electrically driven leading and <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> flaps to increase lift at low speed. The XF-104 did not feature the Boundary Layer Control System of the production aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Blunt <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> in a flow often {{generate}} {{tone noise}} due to wall-jet shear layer and vortex shedding. In this paper, the space-time conservation element (CE/SE) method is employed to numerically study the near-field noise of blunt <b>trailing</b> <b>edges.</b> Two typical cases, namely, flow past a circular cylinder (aeolian noise problem) and flow past a flat plate of finite thickness are considered. The computed frequencies compare well with experimental data. For the aeolian noise problem, comparisons {{with the results}} of other numerical approaches are also presented...|$|R
50|$|The cantilever, mid set, wooden {{wing of the}} OE-1 {{consisted}} of three parts: the 9 m span 90 cm chord rectangular planform centre section and two tapered outer panels 4.5 m span and rounded wing-tips. Three position plain flaps were fitted to the <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> of the centre section with a chord of 24 cm and set positions of −0.5, +8 and +80 degrees. Ailerons occupied the entire <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> of the outer panels. A shallow gull form was due to reduced dihedral on the outer panels.|$|R
