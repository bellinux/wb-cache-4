50|$|Some four {{kilometers}} from <b>the</b> main <b>defensive</b> <b>line</b> and three {{kilometers from}} Tutrakan itself lay <b>the</b> secondary <b>defensive</b> <b>line</b> of <b>the</b> fortress. It {{consisted of a}} single line of trenches with few prepared machine gun nests or obstacles, and no artillery at all. With their attention focused almost entirely on <b>the</b> main <b>defensive</b> <b>line,</b> <b>the</b> Romanian command largely ignored this secondary line.|$|R
5|$|Linebackers line {{up behind}} <b>the</b> <b>{{defensive}}</b> <b>line</b> but {{in front of}} the defensive backfield. They are divided into two types: middle linebackers (MLB) and outside linebackers (OLB). Linebackers are the defensive leaders and call the defensive plays. Their diverse roles include defending the run, pressuring the quarterback, and guarding backs, wide receivers and tight ends in the passing game.|$|E

5|$|As {{the second}} day dawned, the 9th SS Panzer Division {{continued}} to reinforce the German blocking line. Krafft's unit withdrew overnight and joined Spindler's line, coming under his command. Spindler's force was now becoming so large as more men and units arrived at the new front, that {{he was forced to}} split it into two battle groups: Kampfgruppes Allworden and Harder. <b>The</b> <b>defensive</b> <b>line</b> now blocked the entire western side of Arnhem and had closed the gap exploited by Frost alongside the river the previous evening.|$|E

He served for five years as <b>the</b> Lions' <b>defensive</b> <b>line</b> coach, leading a group that became known as the Fearsome Foursome (Roger Brown, Alex Karras, Darris McCord, and Sam Williams) and was acknowledged as one of <b>the</b> best <b>defensive</b> <b>lines</b> in <b>the</b> NFL. After the Lions compiled a 7-5-2 record in 1964, team owner William Clay Ford, Sr. fired five assistant coaches, including Bingaman.|$|R
5|$|The Wake Forest {{defense was}} led by All-America honorable mention linebacker Jon Abbate. Abbate, who was a first-team All-ACC selection, was the team's leading tackler and earned the second-most tackles in the ACC during the season. Safety Josh Gattis was another star on the Wake defense. A first-team All-ACC selection, Gattis was the only player in the ACC to earn 70 tackles and five interceptions.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>defensive</b> <b>line</b> (DL) {{consists}} of defensive ends (DE) and defensive tackles (DT). Defensive ends line {{up on the}} ends of the line, while defensive tackles line up inside, between the defensive ends. The primary responsibilities of defensive ends and defensive tackles is to stop running plays on the outside and inside, respectively, to pressure the quarterback on passing plays, and to occupy the line so that the linebackers can break through.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} line (OL) consists of several players whose primary {{function is to}} block members of <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> <b>line</b> from tackling the ball carrier on running plays or sacking the quarterback on passing plays. The leader of the {{offensive line}} is the center (C), {{who is responsible for}} snapping the ball to the quarterback, blocking, and for making sure that the other linemen do their jobs during the play. On either side of the center are the guards (G), while tackles (T) line up outside the guards.|$|E

5|$|A lull ensued, {{during which}} November talks {{sponsored}} by the OAU failed to conciliate the opposing Chadian factions. Ethiopian leader Mengistu's attempt {{at the beginning of}} 1984 was also unsuccessful. Mengistu's failure was followed on 24 January by a GUNT attack, supported by heavy Libyan armor, on the FANT outpost of Ziguey, a move mainly meant to persuade France and the African states to reopen negotiations. France reacted to this breach of the Red Line by launching the first significant air counter-attack, bringing new troops into Chad and unilaterally raising <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> <b>line</b> to the 16th parallel.|$|E
5|$|About 10:30, the Germans reached <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> <b>line</b> near Torčec, and {{fighting}} began. The few remaining Breguet 19s of the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group mounted {{attacks on the}} bridge over the Drava at Gyékényes. After the Germans reinforced their bridgehead with two more battalions, they overcame the Yugoslav defenders, who had suffered significant losses and were running low on artillery ammunition. About 18:00, the 53rd Infantry Regiment withdrew to Koprivnica with its artillery support, and it remained in the town during the night. At 23:00, following orders from Petrović {{that he was to}} attack on 8 April at all costs, Nedeljković issued orders for a counterattack to be carried out early on 8 April.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} game against Mike Bellotti's Oregon Ducks, Oklahoma {{defensive}} coordinator Brent Venables made some major changes to the defensive depth chart after giving up four long running plays {{through the heart of}} <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> <b>line</b> against Washington. The starters at defensive tackle, cornerback, and strong safety were all demoted, opening opportunities for some freshmen to step up. D.J. Wolfe was replaced by Marcus Walker at cornerback while senior Jason Carter started in place of Keenan Clayton at strong safety. Carter replaced Clayton in the game against Washington after a missed tackle by the freshman led to a Husky touchdown on their first offensive play. Even though all four players at defensive tackle had almost the same number of plays, Steven Coleman was moved {{off the top of the}} depth chart as well.|$|E

5|$|In Canada, {{there was}} little {{emphasis}} on football, much to the disappointment of Rex. By the time Rex was a teenager, Doris realized he and his brothers were too much to handle for a single mother trying to advance her career. She decided {{it was in the}} best interest of the brothers to send them to live with their father, who was <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> <b>line</b> coach for the Minnesota Vikings at the time. The reasons behind this were to keep them out of trouble and to help them expand their knowledge of the game of football where it was more prevalent.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1943, Saban {{joined the}} U.S. Army as World War II {{intensified}} following {{the attack on}} Pearl Harbor. In 1944, he was selected {{to compete in the}} College All-Star Game, a now-defunct annual contest between the National Football League champion and a selection of the best college players from around the country. Saban, then stationed at Fort Benning in Georgia, was named the college team's second Most Valuable Player after quarterback Glenn Dobbs of the University of Tulsa. He kicked three extra points and played on <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> <b>line</b> in the all-stars' 24–21 loss to the Chicago Bears. Saban played for Fort Benning's 3rd Infantry Cockades, a military team, while stationed there. He also studied Chinese for five months at the University of California and served in China and India as an Army interpreter.|$|E
5|$|On May 18, 1979, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats traded Allemang and a {{draft pick}} to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers for linebacker Harry Walters and {{defensive}} end Jim Heighton. The retirement of the Buddy Brown left the Blue Bombers {{looking for an}} offensive guard, and they transitioned Allemang into this role {{on the right side}} of the offensive line. Allemang played in all 16 regular season games during the 1979 season, primarily on the offense. He returned to <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> <b>line</b> in 1980 and alternated between the offense and defense for the remainder of his time with the Blue Bombers. In 1981, Allemang saw a reduced role, playing in only four games. After playing 36 total regular season games with the Blue Bombers, Allemang was cut in October 1981.|$|E

50|$|After a rainy {{night the}} 4th Preslav Division used 3 September to {{approach}} the barbed wire of <b>the</b> main <b>defensive</b> <b>line</b> in Sector II, driving away Romanian patrols, taking Daidur, and repositioning its heavy artillery. In the process the division repelled several Romanian counterattacks, while sustaining light casualties.

50|$|By the {{afternoon}} of 5 September the forts of <b>the</b> main <b>defensive</b> <b>line</b> in Sector II had all fallen {{into the hands of}} the attackers. The Romanian 79th Regiment which had defended the sector was practically destroyed. It was left with only 400 effectives, having suffered 46 officers and 3,000 soldiers killed or wounded. The newly arriving Romanian battalions were unable to prevent the Bulgarian breakthrough, and, with the remnants of the 79th Regiment, tried to prepare <b>the</b> secondary <b>defensive</b> <b>line.</b> In this they were helped by the thick forest behind <b>the</b> main <b>defensive</b> <b>line,</b> which made it hard for the Bulgarian units - intermixed, disorganized, and unprepared for their own success - to advance.|$|R
