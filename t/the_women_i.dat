2500|$|All <b>the</b> <b>Women</b> <b>I</b> Am is the twenty-sixth studio album by American {{country music}} singer Reba McEntire. The album was {{released}} November 9, 2010, through the Valory Music Group, {{a division of}} Big Machine Records.

2500|$|Giving {{the release}} a 3½ star rating, Matt Bjorke of Roughstock, saying [...] "All The Woman I Am had the {{potential}} to be a missed-opportunity after the first two tracks on the record but the album is saved by a meaty collection of songs that hopefully will find Reba retaining her current resurgence at radio". Allison Stewart with the Washington Post compared the album to its predecessor, Keep On Loving You, saying that the album [...] "tries harder, with worse results; McEntire and her collaborators aim for Carrie Underwood and too often wind up with warmed-over Shania Twain". On a positive note, she called her version of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] "fantastic". Thom Jurek with Allmusic gave the release a 2½ rating, saying [...] "Everything, from songs and arrangements to production tries hard to sound on the contemporary edge, but comes off as underscoring that Underwood has the corner on this sound [...] ultimately, All <b>the</b> <b>Women</b> <b>I</b> Am falls flat; it feels awkward in its stylistic mimicry, and has no center".|$|E
