She writes that it becomes incredibly difficult to characterize specifically what should and should not be censored, resulting in negative overreaching consequences of censorship. Heins advises the impact on society from censorship could be so great that censors should be sure <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>real</b> actual harm rather than imagined harm prior to enacting restrictive laws regulating indecency or the Internet.|$|E

He said of Phillips at the time, [...] "He should not be rewarded by being allowed to play unless <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>real</b> substantive change. I don't mean surface change.

[...] He favorably compared Jackson's performance of [...] "Is It Scary" [...] to rock singer Marilyn Manson and noted the lyrics, [...] "If you want to see eccentric oddities, I'll be grotesque before your eyes".
