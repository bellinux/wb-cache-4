40|$|Summary. The {{capacity}} {{values of}} strongly acidic and weakly acidic ionexchangers of biopolymers and the <b>total</b> <b>cation</b> exchange capacity {{of leaves and}} stems of maize are determined in dependence of fertilizer application level, soil pH and growth stage under field experiment conditions. Acidification of leached cinnamonic forest soil at high fertilizer application levels leads to an increased share of strongly acidic ionexchangers, mainly in the leaves. This provides additional cation exchange and shows the adaptability of maize to high soil acidity. The cation exchange capacities of leaves and stems increase with the rise in fertilizer application level and plant age. The capacity of stems is {{higher than that of}} the leaves, but the difference between them decreases in the same direction. In milk ripenness stage and highest fertilizer application level the capacities of leaves and stems are almost equal.

To minimize {{the need for}} a large water intake, they must excrete urine with a very high electrolyte concentration (tonicity). Our objective was to evaluate two potential factors that could influence the maximum urine tonicity, hypernatraemia and the rate of urea excretion. Balance studies were carried out in vasopressin-treated rats fed a low-electrolyte diet. In the first series, the drinking solution contained an equivalent sodium chloride (NaCl) load at 150 or 600 mmol l− 1. In the second series, the maximum urine tonicity was evaluated in rats consuming 600 mmol l− 1 NaCl with an 8 -fold range of urea excretion. Hypernatraemia (148 ± 1 mmol l− 1) developed in all rats that drank 600 mmol l− 1 saline. Although the rate of Na+ + K+ excretion was similar in both saline groups, the maximum urine <b>total</b> <b>cation</b> concentration was significantly higher in the hypernatraemic group (731 ± 31 vs. 412 ± 37 mmol l− 1).

The higher contribution of Mg 2 + than that of Ca 2 + is a result of ferromagnesium minerals, ion exchange between Na+ and Ca 2 +, and precipitation of CaCO 3 (Hem 1991). And, drainage wastewaters are also the source of Mg 2 + (Todd 1980). The Na+ content is from 185 to 823 with a mean of 444.73  mg/L, contributing 47.21 – 76.23 % (60.59 %) to the <b>total</b> <b>cations.</b> The higher contribution of Na+ than that of Ca 2 + to the <b>total</b> <b>cations</b> is due to ion exchange and/or precipitation of CaCO 3. The occurrence of CaCO 3 concretions in the soil cover supports the precipitation of CaCO 3, which is formed due to semi-arid climate of the study area. In contrast to the other concentrations of ions among the cations, the K+ content is observed to be low, which is in between 12 and 121 with a mean of 54.33  mg/L. This is because of more resistance of potash feldspars to chemical weathering and fixation of K+ on clay products (Hem 1991). However, its higher concentration could be due to application of chemical fertilizers (potash variety), since there is no other source of it in the study area.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of exchangeable cations in saline soils {{is limited by}} the difficulty in accurately separating soluble cations from exchangeable cations. A method is examined for saline soils in which exchangeable cations are calculated as the <b>total</b> extractable <b>cations</b> minus the concentration of soil solution (soluble) cations. In addition, a further two standard methods were investigated, one which assumes the <b>total</b> soil extractable <b>cations</b> are exchangeable, the other utilises a pretreatment to remove soluble salts prior to {{measurement of}} the remaining (exchangeable) cations. After equilibration with a range of sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) solutions at various ionic strengths, the exchangeable cation concentrations of two soils (Dermosol and Vertosol) were determined by these methods and compared to known values. The assumption that exchangeable cations can be estimated as the <b>total</b> soil extractable <b>cations,</b> although valid at low ionic strength, resulted in an overestimation of exchangeable Na and Ca concentrations at higher ionic strengths due to the presence of soluble salts. Pretreatment with ethanol and glycerol was found to effectively remove soluble salts thus allowing the accurate measurement of the effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), however, dilution associated with the pretreatment process decreased concentrations of exchangeable Ca while simultaneously increasing exchangeable Na. Using the proposed method, good correlations were found between known and measured concentrations of exchangeable Na (Dermosol: y= 0. 873 x and Vertosol: y= 0. 960 x) and Ca (Dermosol: y= 0. 906 x, and Vertosol: y= 1. 05 x). Therefore, for soils with an ionic strength of approximately 50 mM (ECse 4 dS m- 1) or greater (in which exchangeable cation concentrations are overestimated by assuming the <b>total</b> soil <b>cations</b> are exchangeable), concentrations can be calculated as difference between <b>total</b> extractable <b>cations</b> and soluble cations...|$|R

Two soil types (Mollisol and Vertisol) were equilibrated {{with a range of}} sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) solutions at various ionic strengths. The concentrations of exchangeable cations were then determined using several different types of methods, and the measured exchangeable cation concentrations compared to reference values. At low ionic strength (low salinity), the concentration of exchangeable cations can be accurately estimated from the <b>total</b> soil extractable <b>cations.</b> In saline soils, however, the presence of soluble salts in the soil solution precludes the use of this method. Leaching of the soil with a pre-wash solution (such as alcohol) was found to effectively remove the soluble salts from the soil, thus allowing the accurate measurement of the effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC). However, the dilution associated with this pre-washing increased the exchangeable Ca concentrations while simultaneously decreasing exchangeable Na. In contrast, when calculated as the difference between the <b>total</b> extractable <b>cations</b> and the soil solution cations, good correlations were found between the calculated exchangeable cation concentrations and the reference values for both Na (Mollisol: y= 0. 873 x and Vertisol: y= 0. 960 x) and Ca (Mollisol: y= 0. 901 x and Vertisol: y= 1. 05 x).

In this study, based on actual measurements of major ion concentrations in 43 water samples collected during the years 2005 and 2012, we analyzed systemically the spatial-temporal patterns of water chemistry and its controlling factors in the lake and inflowing rivers. The results reveal that {{the water in the}} Manasarovar Basin is slightly alkaline, with a pH ranging between 7. 4 - 7. 9. The amounts of total dissolved solids (TDS) in lake and river waters are approximately 325. 4 and 88. 7 mg/l, respectively, lower than that in most of the surface waters in the Tibetan Plateau. Because of the long-term effect of evaporative crystallization, in the lake, Na+ and HCO 3 (-) have the highest concentrations, accounting for 46. 8 % and 86. 8 % of the <b>total</b> <b>cation</b> and anion content. However, in the inflowing rivers, the dominant ions are Ca 2 + and HCO 3 (-), accounting for 59. 6 % and 75. 4 % of the <b>total</b> <b>cation</b> and anion content.

30|$|In Fig.  4 b, {{the plot}} of (Ca 2 + + Mg 2 +) vs. (HCO 3 − + SO 4 2 −) shows {{that most of the}} data falls below the 1 : 1 line that {{reflects}} the requirement of cations from weathering of silicate rocks. The high ratio from Fig.  4 a suggests that the excess of alkalinity of these water is balanced by alkalis, i.e., Na+ and K+. Moreover, the excess of alkaline earth elements (Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +) reflects an extra source of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + and is balanced by Cl− and SO 4 2 − (Wen et al. 2005). This statement is supported by Fig.  4 c where (Ca 2 + + Mg 2 +) vs. <b>total</b> <b>cation</b> shows that the data is below the 1 : 1 line, reflect an increasing contribution of Na+ and K+ as TDS increase as reported by Rahman et al. (2011).|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} of simulated {{high-level radioactive waste}} borosilicate glasses to incorporate sulfate has been studied {{as a function of}} glass composition. Combined Raman, 57 Fe Mössbauer and literature evidence supports the attribution of coordination numbers and oxidation states of constituent cations for the purposes of modelling, and results confirm the validity of correlating sulfate incorporation in multicomponent borosilicate radioactive waste glasses with different models. A strong compositional dependency is observed and this can be described by an inverse linear relationship between incorporated sulfate (mol% SO 42 −) and <b>total</b> <b>cation</b> field strength index of the glass, Σ(z/a 2), with a high goodness-of-fit (R 2 ≈ 0. 950). Similar relationships are also obtained if theoretical optical basicity, Λth (R 2 ≈ 0. 930) or non-bridging oxygen per tetrahedron ratio, NBO/T (R 2 ≈ 0. 919), are used. Results support the application of these models, and in particular Σ(z/a 2), as predictive tools to aid the development of new glass compositions with enhanced sulfate capacities...|$|R
