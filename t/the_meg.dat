25|$|MEG is {{also being}} used to better {{localize}} responses in the brain. The openness of <b>the</b> <b>MEG</b> setup allows external auditory and visual stimuli to be easily introduced. Some movement by the subject is also possible {{as long as it}} does not jar the subject's head. The responses in the brain before, during, and after the introduction of such stimuli/movement can then be mapped with greater spatial resolution than was previously possible with EEG. Psychologists are also taking advantage of MEG neuroimaging to better understand relationships between brain function and behavior. For example, a number of studies have been done comparing <b>the</b> <b>MEG</b> responses of patients with psychological troubles to control patients. There has been great success isolating unique responses in patients with schizophrenia, such as auditory gating deficits to human voices. MEG {{is also being}} used to correlate standard psychological responses, such as the emotional dependence of language comprehension.|$|E

500|$|Having left Cold Feet, Ripley {{began to}} take on more leading roles; her first role was as {{housewife}} Deanna in the BBC thriller Green-Eyed Monster, which was broadcast in September 2001. She researched her character, a murderer, by visiting a coroner. Guardian critic Gareth McLean wrote of her performance, [...] "Ripley {{did a good job}} of exorcising the ghost of Jenny Gifford [...] by coolly cranking up the insane desperation and needy malevolence to an impressive degree." [...] In 2002, she played domestic abuse victim Donna Massey in Danny Brocklehurst's The Stretford Wives. Ripley was initially not eager to play another character from around Manchester so soon after leaving Cold Feet, but she changed her mind after reading the script. She did not research spousal abuse to play her character, a woman struggling to bring up her two children in a run-down house while her husband is imprisoned, because she did not find it difficult to [...] "work out what it's like to be scared and want to protect your kids". Also in 2002, Ripley played Rose Bell in the ITV post-war period drama Dead Gorgeous, alongside Helen McCrory. The following year, she provided the voice of Meg in the ITV adaptation of <b>the</b> <b>Meg</b> and Mog children's books, before playing Jill in the third series of the BBC One sitcom Bedtime at the end of 2003.|$|E
500|$|Like most Disney heroines, Meg sings {{about the}} {{experience}} of {{falling in love with}} the film's hero. Recognized as Meg's signature song, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] has been identified as the character's [...] "big moment of romantic realization" [...] in Hercules. Prior to [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)", the audience has only been exposed to Meg's cynicism; the song finally reveals that Meg's cynicism is actually a reaction to her romantic side, uncovering the [...] "misunderstood nature" [...] of the character. [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] reveals that <b>the</b> <b>Meg</b> has fallen in love too fast before, and explains that she is afraid of repeating the same mistake once more with Hercules. Despite her best efforts, the character realizes that she has in fact begun to develop feelings for Hercules much to her chagrin, but at first refuses to admit this; the song allows Meg to [...] "work through her denial", by [...] "alternating between fantasizing about how delightful it would be to be loved by Herc, and stomping her foot in anger at the very thought." [...] Resembling an [...] "admonishing" [...] exchange between Meg and the Muses, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] is Meg's attempt to avoid the clichéd storylines of her predecessors. Finally, after strolling a Greek courtyard while performing the song accompanied by the Muses who insist she is in denial, the character's resistance eventually proves futile and she ultimately relents. According to Taylor Weatherby of Billboard, the character [...] "finally comes to a conclusion to which many a girl (or guy) can relate". Tracy Dye of Bustle described the scene: [...] "Joined by The Muses, Meg attempts to vehemently deny her amour for Hercules". Writing for film critic Eric D. Snider's website, Kimber Kay joked that Meg [...] "tries her best to give a top 40 rendition of her solo song, but it gets stolen by the magnificent Muses." [...] Additionally, the musical number predicts that one of Hercules' most difficult challenges will be trying to change Meg's opinion of him. Writing for The Daily Dot, Aja Romano cited the song as Meg's [...] "I Want" [...] song.|$|E

[...] <b>The</b> <b>MEG,</b> which provides {{an improvement over}} EEG in spatiotemporal characterization, allows researchers to stimulate {{certain parts of the}} brain with environmental cues and observe the response in a holistic brain model.

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>MEG</b> (and EEG) signals {{derive from}} {{the net effect of}} ionic {{currents}} flowing in the dendrites of neurons during synaptic transmission. In accordance with Maxwell's equations, any electrical current will produce a magnetic field, and it is this field that is measured. The net currents {{can be thought of as}} current dipoles, i.e. currents with a position, orientation, and magnitude, but no spatial extent. [...] According to the right-hand rule, a current dipole gives rise to a magnetic field that points around the axis of its vector component.|$|E
2500|$|Although EEG and MEG signals {{originate}} {{from the same}} neurophysiological processes, there are important differences. [...] Magnetic fields are less distorted than electric fields by the skull and scalp, which results in a better spatial resolution of <b>the</b> <b>MEG.</b> Whereas scalp EEG is sensitive to both tangential and radial components of a current source in a spherical volume conductor, MEG detects only its tangential components. Scalp EEG can, therefore, detect activity both in the sulci {{and at the top}} of the cortical gyri, whereas MEG is most sensitive to activity originating in sulci. EEG is, therefore, sensitive to activity in more brain areas, but activity that is visible in MEG can also be localized with more accuracy.|$|E

2500|$|The modern penny whistle is {{indigenous}} to the British Isles particularly England when factory-made [...] "tin whistles" [...] were produced by Robert Clarke from 1840–1882 in Manchester and later New Moston, England. Down to 1900, {{they were also}} marketed as [...] "Clarke London Flageolets" [...] or [...] "Clarke Flageolets". The whistle's fingering system {{is similar to that}} of the six hole, [...] "simple system English flutes" [...] ("simple" [...] in comparison to Boehm system flutes). The six hole, diatonic system is also used on baroque flutes, and was of course well known before Robert Clarke began producing his tin whistles. Clarke's first whistle, <b>the</b> <b>Meg,</b> was pitched in high A and was later made in other keys suitable for Victorian parlour music. The company showed the whistles in The Great Exhibition of 1851. The Clark tin whistle is voiced somewhat on an organ-pipe with a flattened tube forming the lip of the fipple mouthpiece and is usually made from rolled tin sheet or brass. Manufactured tin whistles became available no earlier than 1840, and were mass-produced and widespread due to their relative affordability.|$|E

6000|$|As far as plot goes, though Godwin {{denied that}} it had any story, [...] "The Antiquary" [...] may be placed among the most careful. The underplot of the Glenallans, gloomy almost beyond endurance, is very ingeniously made to unravel the mystery of Lovel. The other side-narrative, that of Dousterswivel, is the weak point of the whole; but this Scott justifies by [...] "very late {{instances}} of the force of superstitious credulity, to a much greater extent." [...] Some occurrence of the hour may have suggested the knavish adept with his divining-rod. But facts are never a real excuse for the morally incredible, or all but incredible, in fiction. On the wealth and vraisemblance and variety of character it were superfluous to dilate. As in Shakspeare, there {{is not even a}} minor person but lives and is of flesh and blood, if we except, perhaps, Dousterswivel and Sir Arthur Wardour. Sir Arthur is only Sir Robert Hazlewood over again, with a slightly different folly and a somewhat more amiable nature. Lovel's place, as usual, is among the shades of heroes, and his love-affair is far less moving, far more summarily treated, than that of Jenny Caxon. The skilful contrasts are perhaps most remarkable when we compare Elspeth of the Burnfoot with the gossiping old women in the post-office at Fairport,--a town studied perhaps from Arbroath. It was the opinion of Sydney Smith that every one of the novels, before [...] "The Fortunes of Nigel," [...] contained a Meg Merrilies and a Dominie Sampson. He may have recognized a male Meg in Edie Ochiltree,--the invaluable character who is always behind a wall, always overhears everything, and holds the threads of the plot.

Few will agree with him that Meg Merrilies, in either of these cases, is [...] "good, but good too often." ...|$|E
