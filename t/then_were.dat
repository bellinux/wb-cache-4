Rounding out Crosby's accolades for the 2003–04 regular season were QMJHL All-Rookie and First All-Star Team honours, as well as Offensive Rookie, Offensive Player and Personality of the Year Awards.

5|$|Mondays through Saturdays, BART trains run on five routes; {{four are}} transbay routes {{connecting}} San Francisco to Oakland and various destinations in the East Bay, while the fifth, the Richmond–Warm Springs line, runs {{exclusively in the}} East Bay. Two of the five routes do not run on nights and weekends, and one is truncated on Saturdays, but all stations remain accessible by transfers via other routes. In September 1972 BART's first route opened: Fremont to MacArthur, extended to Richmond in January 1973. Concord to MacArthur started in May 1973 and Montgomery Street to Daly City began in November 1973. The original system was completed in September 1974 when trains first carried passengers through the underwater Transbay Tube.

5|$|On May 30, 1948, in {{the first}} stage of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Lajjun was {{captured}} by Israel's Golani Brigade in Operation Gideon. The capture was particularly important for the Israelis because of its strategic location at the entrance of the Wadi Ara, which thus, brought their forces closer to Jenin. During the second truce between Israel and the Arab coalition, in early September, a United Nations official fixed the permanent truce line in the area of Lajjun, according to press reports. A 500-yard strip was established {{on both sides of the}} line in which Arabs and Jews were allowed to harvest their crops. Lajjun was used as transit place by the Israel Defense Forces to transfer 1,400 Arab women, children and elderly from Ijzim, who <b>then</b> <b>were</b> sent on foot to Jenin.|$|E
5|$|Soviet Russia, {{while at}} the time {{publicly}} supporting Polish and Lithuanian independence, sponsored communist agitators working against {{the government of the}} Second Polish Republic, and considered that its eastern borders should approximate those of the defunct Congress Poland. Poles and Lithuanians, on the other hand, inspired by memories of the greatness of the erstwhile Grand Duchy of Lithuania, part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, saw their borders as lying much farther east. The leader of the Polish forces, Józef Piłsudski, discerned an opportunity for regaining territories that were once the part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and since <b>then</b> <b>were</b> part of the Prussian Empire, shaken by the 1917 Revolution and the ongoing Russian Civil War.|$|E

From the 1860s onwards, many of these Kangchu chalked up debts and began to sell their property rights to these merchants or to larger business magnates (Kongsi in Teochew) based in Singapore, who were known to the locals as Tuan Sungai (literally Masters of the River). The Kangchu <b>then</b> <b>were</b> often hired as supervisors or managers by the merchants to keep watch on the day-to-day operations of the gambier and pepper plantations.

5|$|The first mass exterminations at Auschwitz {{took place}} in early September 1941, when 900 inmates were killed by {{gathering}} them {{in the basement of}} Block 11 and gassing them with Zyklon B. This building proved unsuitable for mass gassings, so the site of the killings was moved to the crematorium at Auschwitz I (Crematorium I, which operated until July 1942). There, more than 700 victims could be killed at once. In order to keep the victims calm, they were told they were to undergo disinfection and de-lousing. They were ordered to undress outside and <b>then</b> <b>were</b> locked in the building and gassed. After its decommissioning as a gas chamber, the building was converted to a storage facility and later served as an air raid shelter for the SS. The gas chamber and crematorium were reconstructed after the war using the original components, which remained on site. Some 60,000 people were killed at Crematorium I.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} {{composed}} {{of a variety of}} volcanic and sedimentary rock formations from the Devonian period. At that time the Scottish landmass formed part of the Old Red Sandstone Continent and lay some 10-25 degrees south of the equator. The accumulations of Old Red Sandstone, laid down from 408 to 370 million years ago, were created as earlier Silurian rocks, uplifted by the formation of Pangaea, eroded and <b>then</b> <b>were</b> deposited into river deltas. The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of the eroding mountains, stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. The structure of Papa Stour is largely made up of ashes and lavas from volcanic activity associated with this period, including bands of solidified volcanic ash and lava (rhyolite), {{but there is also a}} Devonian fish bed at Lamba Banks. There are numerous large boulders deposited by Pleistocene glaciation.|$|E
5|$|The {{new town}} of Conwy was {{populated}} by English settlers, particularly from nearby Cheshire and Lancashire, {{and the town}} walls were in part designed to encourage immigrants to settle there in safety. The town of Conwy was only modestly successful, however; by 1312 it had 124 burgage tenements – properties paying rent to the king – making it more successful than neighbouring Caernarfon, but less so than Beaumaris. Welsh residents appear to have slowly arrived inside the town during the 14th century, and even <b>then</b> <b>were</b> subject to considerable suspicion. Protecting the town remained a priority and during this period the constable charged with {{the security of the}} castle was also the mayor of Conwy, although protecting the town walls was probably the duty of the citizens rather than the forces attached to the castle. The walls were guarded by crossbowmen, and improved firing positions for them were built into the town walls {{at the start of the}} 14th century.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, historians {{tended to}} think ancient Egypt {{was the site}} of cat domestication, owing to the clear depictions of house cats in Egyptian {{paintings}} about 3,600 years old. However, in 2004, a Neolithic grave excavated in Shillourokambos, Cyprus, contained the skeletons, laid close to one another, of both a human and a cat. The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, pushing back the earliest known feline–human association significantly. The cat specimen is large and closely resembles the African wildcat, rather than present-day domestic cats. This discovery, combined with genetic studies, suggests cats were probably domesticated in the Middle East, in the Fertile Crescent {{around the time of the}} development of agriculture, and <b>then</b> <b>were</b> brought to Cyprus and Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In the 1963–64 season, the Royals {{achieved}} a 55–25 record, which put them {{second place in}} the Eastern Division. Under new coach Jack McMahon, Robertson flourished, {{and for the first time}} in his career, he had a decent supporting cast: second scoring option Jack Twyman was now supplemented by Jerry Lucas and Wayne Embry, and fellow guard Adrian Smith helped Robertson in the backcourt. Robertson led the NBA in free-throw percentage, scored a career-high 31.4 points per game, and averaged 9.9 rebounds and 11.0 assists per game. The averages for his first five NBA seasons are a triple-double: 30.3 points, 10.4 rebounds and 10.6 assists per game. He won the NBA MVP award and became the only player other than Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain to win it from 1960 to 1968. Robertson also won his second All-Star Game MVP award that year after scoring 26 points, grabbing 14 rebounds, and dishing off 8 assists in an East victory.
