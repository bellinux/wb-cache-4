500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by {{the cast and crew}} of The X-Files. Producer J.P. Finn praised the episode and Carter's directing, saying [...] "We were all pretty nervous doing that one, because Chris Carter was a new director. It turned out that he directed very...It was a great script, a great cast, and he ended up directing a home run. One of the charming <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> was the end, where we had these alien heads placed on young children. It was so endearing to see them on the set between takes, playing with Chris and everyone". Actor David Duchovny said of Carter's directing [...] "Chris came in meticulously prepared, which is his nature. I think his first episode was great". Carter himself described it as one of his favorite episodes because [...] "it was a chance for me to sort of do it all, and it came out in ways better than I imagined it would".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{over a number}} of afternoons at the end of 2007, with each day's filming {{beginning}} with a repeat of the last section from the previous day, to help blend each scene into the next. It was filmed with a [...] "single camera mentality" [...] but with up to five cameras running to give Brown a [...] "freedom of performance away from hitting marks or favouring one particular camera position." [...] This also helped in the case of technical problems, meaning that second takes were not necessary. Brown cried when she read the script and though she did not cry during fiming, she had expected to, planning to pause the tape recorder if she did. She stated that {{the most difficult part of}} the script was the line about Jim being [...] "here, but not here" [...] because she felt that way about Bardon. Arnold admitted to [...] " [...] away the tears" [...] many times and noted that several other crew cried, and that one of the toughest <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> was that it mirrored real-life events. Brown found the episode easy to film due to the fact there were no other cast members to make mistakes, and because she [...] "knew the character backwards" [...] and [...] "exactly how she'd behave and what she'd feel and [...] her history." [...] She praised Arnold and the crew, stating that the episode was [...] "lovely" [...] to make and she felt [...] "very fortunate to be given the opportunity." [...] The performance was edited in post production after being committed to tape, where usually all scenes are vision mixed, and the usual EastEnders theme tune was replaced at the end of the episode with Tony Jackson's [...] "Pretty Baby".|$|E
2500|$|Pullman {{himself was}} {{described}} by a Times interviewer as sounding [...] "ambivalent" [...] and [...] "guarded" [...] about the film, saying in March 2008: [...] "A lot of <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> were good... Nothing's perfect. Nothing can bring out all that's in the book. There are always compromises". He hoped, however, {{that the rest of}} the trilogy would be adapted with the same cast and crew. In July 2009, after this possibility had been exhausted, Weitz told Time.com that he thought the film's special effects ended up being its [...] "most successful element." ...|$|E

2500|$|The filmmakers {{obscured}} the explicitly Biblical {{character of the}} Authority to avoid offending viewers. Weitz declared {{that he would not}} do the same for the planned sequels. [...] "Whereas The Golden Compass had to be introduced to the public carefully", he said, [...] "the religious themes {{in the second and third}} books can't be minimised without destroying the spirit of these books. ...I will not be involved with any 'watering down' of books two and three, since what I have been working towards the whole time in the first film is to be able to deliver on the second and third". In May 2006, Pullman said of a version of the script that [...] "all the important scenes are there and will have their full value"; in March 2008, he said of the finished film that [...] "a lot of <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> were good.... Nothing can bring out all that's in the book. There are always compromises".|$|E
2500|$|Taylor had {{thoughts}} of retiring {{by the time}} he played the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro in January 1985. He was encouraged by the nascent democracy in Brazil at the time, buoyed by the positive reception he got from the large crowd and other musicians, and musically energized by the sounds and nature of Brazilian music. [...] "I had... sort of bottomed-out in a drug habit, my marriage with Carly had dissolved, and I had basically been depressed and lost for a while," [...] he recalled in 1995. [...] "I sort of hit a low spot. I was asked to go down to Rio de Janeiro to play in this festival down there. We put the band together and went down and it was just an amazing response. I played to 300,000 people. They not only knew my music, they knew <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and were interested in aspects of it that to that point had only interested me. To have that kind of validation right about then was really what I needed. It helped get me back on track." [...] The song [...] "Only a Dream in Rio" [...] was written in tribute to that night, with lines like I was there that very day and my heart came back alive. The October 1985 album, That's Why I'm Here, from which that song came, started a series of studio recordings that, while spaced further apart than his previous records, showed a more consistent level of quality and fewer covers, most notably the Buddy Holly song [...] "Everyday", released as a single reached No. 61. On the album track [...] "Only You," [...] the backing vocals were performed by an all star duo of Joni Mitchell and Don Henley.|$|E
2500|$|The Daily Telegraph {{gave the}} game a 2/5 saying [...] "Despite {{the fact that}} Absolution is a hugely disappointing entry into the canon, Hitman is still a fabulous series." [...] IBITimes gave the game a 5/10 saying [...] "An unremarkable, {{derivative}} clone of a game that's barely a shadow of what Hitman used to be." [...] Videogamer.com gave it 5/10 saying [...] "The problem with Absolution is that its new custodians from the Kane and Lynch team seem to have fundamentally misunderstood what made Hitman great." [...] Blogcritics.org gave the game a 3/5 saying [...] "There are definitely good <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but all too often the game's failures shine through more clearly than its successes." [...] PC Gamer gave it 66% saying [...] "A passable stealth game, but one that betrays almost everything that, until now, has made Hitman great." [...] GameTrailers gave it 6.9/10 saying [...] "It’s clear that {{a good deal of}} effort was put into crafting Hitman: Absolution’s world. This makes its flaws all the more unfortunate." [...] New Statesman gave no rating but said [...] "If developers want to win back fans when they revisit established franchises maybe they should look to what made those games popular {{in the first place and}} by doing so maybe they’d avoid stepping on a rake or two." [...] GamerSyndrome gave no rating but said [...] "Hitman Absolution tries to be a jack of all trades but ends up being a master of none." [...] The Irish Times gave no score but said [...] "The move away from the completely open world may leave some hardcore fans of Hitman disappointed." [...] Gaming Age rated the game a 'C' and said [...] "It feels like I’m playing a low rent, knockoff Metal Gear title as opposed to traditional Hitman." [...] The Daily Record gave the game 3/5 saying [...] "While it’s more accessible than previous Hitman games, Absolution loses a lot of the freedom that fans of the franchise love, and perhaps doesn’t necessarily fit the Hitman name any longer." [...] TheEscapist gave no score but said [...] "Hitman Absolution is not the best nor the worst Hitman". Whatculture gave the game a 3/5 saying [...] "Not Quite the expected hit". The Guardian gave it 3/5 saying [...] "The game may look better and play better than any Hitman game before it, but one can only marvel at how IO managed to lose sight of their IP's most appealing aspects so often." ...|$|E

60|$|It was a {{great day}} for Grayton, that. It was a {{wonderful}} day--quite an indescribable day; but there were also some <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> that made Captain Ellice feel somehow that it was a mysterious day, for, while there were hearty congratulations, and much sobbing for joy on the part of Mrs Bright, there were also whisperings which puzzled him a good deal.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Wickam, {{with her}} eyebrows elevated, {{and her head}} on one side, lighted the way upstairs to a clean, neat chamber, opening on another chamber dimly lighted, {{where there was a}} bed. In the first room, an old woman sat {{mechanically}} staring out at the open window, on the darkness. In the second, stretched upon the bed, lay the shadow of a figure that had spurned the wind and rain, one wintry night; hardly to be recognised now, but by the long black hair that showed so very black against the colourless face, and all the white <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{and if it}} {{were wrong}} to meet any other young man I ought not to go; but there is nothing {{specially}} wrong in my meeting him. She has said very unkind <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and I intend that she shall know that I will not notice them." [...] As Rachel spoke Mrs. Ray looked up at her, and was surprised by the expression of unrelenting purpose which she saw there. There had come over her face that motion in her eyes and that arching of her brows which Mrs. Ray had seen before, but which hitherto she had hardly construed into their true meaning. Now she was beginning to construe these signs aright, and to understand that there would be difficulty in managing her little family.|$|E

60|$|At half-past two the {{following}} day he put himself into the fly. During the morning {{he had taken the}} will out of the book, determined to carry it with him to Carmarthen in his pocket. But when he attempted to enclose it in an envelope for the purpose, his mind misgave him and he restored it. Hateful as was the property to him, odious as were the house and all <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> no sooner did the doing of the act by which he was to release himself from them come within the touch of his fingers, than he abandoned the idea. At such moments the estate would again have charms for him, and he would remember that such a deed, when once done, would admit of no recall.|$|E

In no time you'll be a staid, middle-aged matron, and I shall be nice, old maid Aunt Anne, coming to visit you on vacations. You'll always keep a corner for me, won't you, Di darling? Not the spare room, of course--old maids can't aspire to spare rooms, and I shall be as 'umble as Uriah Heep, and quite content with a little over-the-porch or off-the-parlor cubby hole." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{the first}} time he became animated. A faint flush crept into his cheek. He raised his open hand and clenched it, and dropped it to his knee. He spoke, looking away from me, and for {{all the rest of the}} time he looked away. [...] "We are but phantoms!" [...] he said, [...] "and the phantoms of phantoms, desires like cloud-shadows and wills of straw that eddy in the wind; the days pass, use and wont carry us through as a train carries the shadow of its lights--so be it! But one thing is real and certain, one thing is no dream-stuff, but eternal and enduring.

But I go off from the idea that every living being lives in a state not differing essentially from a state of hallucination concerning the <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Truth, essential truth, is hidden. Always. Of course there must be a measure of truth in our working illusions, a working measure of truth, or the creature would smash itself up and end itself, but beyond that discretion of the fire and the pitfall lies a wide margin of error about which we may be deceived for years.

The men in bonds can know nothing of the real state of things. Plexo, when he rushed out for their aid, could have had no time to do more than to tell them to take up their arms and follow him; indeed, it is doubtful whether he himself had any idea that we were aught but what we seemed. Therefore, the first impression assuredly will be that we were malefactors of the worst kind, escaped slaves, men with no respect for the gods; for assuredly no Egyptians, even the worst of criminals, would, in cold blood, have laid hands on the high priest of Osiris." ...|$|E

The Word of God (which, by the way, is {{beginning}} to be circulated now among us in England in our mother tongue), that Word tells man plainly to go forth and replenish the earth. Common sense, {{from the beginning of}} time, has told us the same thing, but what does man do? He sticks to several small patches of the earth, and there he trades, and works, and builds, and propagates, until these patches swarm like ant-hills, and then he wars, and fights, and kills off the surplus population; in other words, slays the young men of the world and sows misery, debt and desolation broadcast. In fact, man {{seems to me to be}} mad. Rather than obey God and the dictates of common sense, he will leave the fairest portions of the world untenanted, and waste his life and energies in toiling for a crust of bread or fighting for a foot of land!" ...|$|E
