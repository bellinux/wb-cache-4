25|$|Chic Harley {{attended}} East High in Columbus {{and was one}} of {{the greatest}} players to attend an Ohio high school. He passed, ran, received, punted, kicked and played defense. Harley came to Ohio State in 1916 and Columbus fans instantly fell in love with <b>the</b> <b>Chic.</b> Harley and the Buckeyes won the very first Big Ten championship in school history in 1916 when the Buckeyes finished 7–0. He would repeat in 1917 finishing 8–0–1, giving the Buckeyes a second outright title. In 1918, he left to be a pilot in the air force for World War I. With Harley's return in 1919, the Buckeyes would only lose one game—to Illinois. Chic Harley left OSU with a career record of 22–1–1. At the time, OSU played at the small Ohio Field and Harley brought such record crowds it became necessary to open Ohio Stadium in 1922. The stadium was built entirely on fan donations and several stadium drives around the city where Harley would often appear. In 1951, when the College Football Hall of Fame opened, Harley was inducted as an inaugural member.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the album's release, a press {{statement}} from Gil Friesen, the then President of A Records, read that, [...] "The whole industry has a stake in this success". Time magazine speculated that [...] "the fallout from Thriller has given the [...] business its best years since the heady days of 1978, when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of $4.1 billion". Time summed up Thrillers impact as a [...] "restoration of confidence" [...] for an industry bordering on [...] "the ruins of punk and <b>the</b> <b>chic</b> regions of synthesizer pop". The publication described Jackson's influence at that point as, [...] "Star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too".|$|E

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, a {{different}} set of character types were established, including <b>the</b> <b>chic</b> suburbanite, the subtle single, the traditional family person, the successful professional, and the elegant socialite. Erica was in <b>the</b> <b>chic</b> suburbanite category which comprised [...] "flashy," [...] achievement-oriented characters with little interest in family and friends. Like others in this category, Erica was written as [...] "flamboyant, frivolous and carefree, with little commitment other than [...] own selfish enjoyment of life." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1968, {{the band}} was being billed as [...] "Janis Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company", and the media {{coverage}} given to Joplin generated resentment within the band. The other members of Big Brother thought that Joplin was on a [...] "star trip", while others were telling Joplin that Big Brother was a terrible band and that she ought to dump them. Time magazine called Joplin [...] "probably the most powerful singer {{to emerge from the}} white rock movement", and Richard Goldstein wrote for the May 1968 issue of Vogue magazine that Joplin was [...] "the most staggering leading woman in rock... she slinks like tar, scowls like war... clutching the knees of a final stanza, begging it not to leave... Janis Joplin can sing <b>the</b> <b>chic</b> off any listener." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, {{he filed}} for divorce from his second wife, Jeanne. A week later, his {{business}} partnership with the Riviera hotel in Las Vegas dissolved amid reports of the casino's refusal to agree to Martin's request to perform only once a night. He {{was taken by the}} MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, where he was the featured performer on the hotel's opening night December 23, 1973, and also signed a three-picture deal with MGM Studios. Less than a month after his second marriage had dissolved, Martin married 26-year-old Catherine Hawn, on April 25, 1973. Hawn had been the receptionist at <b>the</b> <b>chic</b> Gene Shacrove hair salon in Beverly Hills. They divorced November 10, 1976. He was also briefly engaged to Gail Renshaw, Miss World–U.S.A. 1969. Eventually, Martin reconciled with Jeanne, though they never remarried.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the release}} of Esperanza: The Movie, Santos {{appeared}} opposite de Guzman in the film Paano Ang Puso Ko?, as an insolvent juvenile struggling to pursue higher education amidst financial struggles. The film was a commercial success. In the 1998 movie Muling Ibalik Ang Tamis Ng Pag-ibig that Santos and de Guzman led, the former as an ambitious woman who takes a pseudo-husband {{in order to prevent}} her impending marriage to a family friend. The film received mostly critical reviews, and was generally considered a commercial triumph; [...] "She [...] became a teen idol, as well as the beloved half of the popular love team—at its peak [...] they crossed over to the big screen and starred in one hit after another, movies that made the fans scream with delight and the producers laugh {{all the way to the}} bank", wrote <b>the</b> <b>Chic</b> Magazine. For the second consecutive year, Santos won the Teenage Movie Queen of Philippine Movies citation from Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Scholarship Foundation.|$|E
6000|$|With {{the elders}} it was {{sense of duty}} that prevailed. That, at all events, was English. The country must be saved. To {{their sons and daughters}} it was the originality, the novelty that {{gradually}} appealed. Mrs. Denton's Fridays became a new sensation. It came to be <b>the</b> <b>chic</b> and proper thing to appear at them in shades of mauve or purple. A pushing little woman in Hanover Street designed the [...] "Denton" [...] bodice, with hanging sleeves and square-cut neck. The younger men inclined towards a coat shaped to the waist with a roll collar.|$|E
60|$|This bird {{is about}} twelve inches long, {{of which the}} {{compressed}} and curved beak occupies two inches. The colour of the breast and upper surface appears at first sight nearly black, but a close examination shows that {{no part of it}} is devoid of colour; and by holding it in various lights, the most rich and glowing tints become visible. The head, covered with short velvety feathers, which advance on <b>the</b> <b>chic</b> much further than on {{the upper part of the}} beak, is of a purplish bronze colour; the whole of the back and shoulders is rich bronzy green, while the closed wings and tail are of the most brilliant violet purple, all the plumage having a delicate silky gloss. The mass of feathers which cover the breast is really almost black, with faint glosses of green and purple, but their outer edges are margined with glittering bands of emerald green. The whole lower part of the body is rich buffy yellow, including the tuft of plumes which spring from the sides, and extend an inch and a half beyond the tail. When skins are exposed to the light the yellow fades into dull white, from which circumstance it derived its specific name. About six of the innermost of these plumes on each side have the midrib elongated into slender black wires, which bend at right angles, and curve somewhat backwards to a length of about ten inches, forming one of those extraordinary and fantastic ornaments with which this group of birds abounds. The bill is jet black, and the feet bright yellow. (See lower figure on the plate at the beginning of this chapter).|$|E

60|$|If, {{however, the}} men's dress in England is informal, impatient, I think {{one will be}} well within the lines of safety in saying that above {{everything}} the English women's dress expresses sentiment, though I suppose {{it is no more}} expressive of personal sentiment than <b>the</b> <b>chic</b> of our women's dress is expressive of personal chic; in either case the dressmaker, male or female, has impersonally much to do with it. Under correction of those countrywomen of ours who will not allow that the Englishwomen know how to dress, I will venture to say that their expression of sentiment in dress is charming, but how charming it comparatively is I shall be far from saying. I will only make so bold as to affirm that it seems more adapted to the slender fluency of youth than some realizations of the American ideal; and that after the azaleas and rhododendrons in the Park there is nothing in nature more suggestive of girlish sweetness and loveliness than the costumes in which the wearers flow by the flowery expanses in carriage or on foot. The colors worn are often as courageous as the vegetable tints; the vaporous air softens and subdues crimsons and yellows that I am told would shriek aloud in our arid atmosphere; but mostly the shades worn tend to soft pallors, lavender, and pink, and creamy white. A group of girlish shapes in these colors, seen newly lighted at a doorway from a passing carriage, gave as they pressed eagerly forward a supreme effect of that sentiment in English dress which I hope I am not recreant in liking. Occasionally, also, there was a scarf, lightly escaping, lightly caught, which, with an endearing sash, renewed for a fleeting moment a bygone age of Sensibility, as we find it recorded in many a graceful page, on many a glowing canvas.|$|E
60|$|But {{these were}} minor defects in an {{establishment}} which had many merits, and was mainly of the temperament and {{intention of the}} large English railroad hotels. They looked from their windows down into a gardened square, peopled with a full share of the superabounding statues of Berlin and frequented by babies and nurse maids who seemed not to mind the cold {{any more than the}} stone kings and generals. The aspect of this square, like the excellent cooking of the hotel and the architecture of the imperial capital, suggested the superior civilization of Paris. Even the rows of gray houses and private palaces of Berlin are in the French taste, which is the only taste there is in Berlin. The suggestion of Paris is constant, but it is of Paris in exile, and without <b>the</b> <b>chic</b> which the city wears in its native air. The crowd lacks this as much as the architecture and the sculpture; there is no distinction among the men except for now and then a military figure, and among the women no style such as relieves the commonplace rash of the New York streets. The Berliners are plain and ill dressed, both men and women, and even the little children are plain. Every one is ill dressed, but no one is ragged, and among the undersized homely folk of the lower classes there is no such poverty-stricken shabbiness as shocks and insults the sight in New York. That which distinctly recalls our metropolis is the lofty passage of the elevated trains intersecting the prospectives of many streets; but in Berlin the elevated road is carried on massive brick archways and not lifted upon gay, crazy iron ladders like ours.|$|E
6000|$|People to whom cold means misery, {{who hate}} to be braced, and shudder at the word [...] "seasonable," [...] can have little {{difficulty}} in accounting for {{the origin of the}} sports of winter. They need only adapt to the circumstances that old Lydian tradition which says that games of chance were invented during a great famine. Men permitted themselves to eat only every second day, and tried to forget their hunger in playing at draughts and dice. That is clearly the invention of a southern people, which never had occasion to wish it could become oblivious of the weather, as too many of us would like to be in England. Such shivering and indolent folks may be inclined to say that skating and curling and wildfowl-shooting, and the other diversions which seduce the able-bodied from the warm precincts of the cheerful fire, were only contrived to enable us to forget the state of the thermometer. Whether or not that was the purpose of the first northerner who fixed sheep-bones beneath his feet, to course more smoothly over the frozen sound, {{there can be no doubt}} that winter sports answer their presumed purpose. They keep up that glow which only exercise in the open air can give, and promote the health which shows itself in the complexion. It is the young lady who interprets literally the Scotch invitation [...] "come into the fire," [...] and who spoils the backs of library novels by holding them too near the comfortable hearth, she it is who suffers from the ignoble and unbecoming liberties that winter takes with the human countenance. Happier and wiser is she who studies the always living and popular Dutch roll rather than the Grecian bend, and who blooms with continual health and good temper. Our changeful climate affords so few opportunities of learning to skate, that it is really extraordinary to find so much skill, and to see feats so difficult and graceful. In Canada, where frost is a certainty, and where the covered [...] "rinks" [...] make skating an indoor sport, it is not odd that great perfection should be attained. But as fast as Canadians bring over a new figure or a new trick it is picked up, and critics may dispute as to whether the bold and dashing style of the English school of skaters is not preferable to the careful and smooth, but somewhat pretty and niggling manner of the colonists. Our skating stands to the Canadian fashion somewhat as French does to English etching. We have the dash and <b>the</b> <b>chic</b> with skates which Frenchmen show with the etching-needle, and the Canadian, on the other hand, is apt to decline into the mere prettiness which is the fault of English etchers.|$|E
