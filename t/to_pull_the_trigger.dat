5|$|Mulder's own {{problems}} arise when {{his cell phone}} rings and Krycek disappears from his car. Mulder, after learning what Doggett has witnessed, believes that Crane gave Krycek access to the FBI. Suddenly, Krycek smashes through the car window with his prosthetic hand and crushes Mulder's cell phone. Krycek aims his gun at Mulder and tells him to get out. Krycek is about <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> when a bullet administered by Skinner pierces his arm. Krycek tries to pick his gun up again, but Skinner shoots his hand, rendering it useless. Krycek pushes his gun over and tells Skinner to shoot Mulder, telling him Mulder's life will grant him a thousand lives. Instead, Skinner raises his gun and shoots Krycek in the head. Doggett attempts to apprehend Rohrer and Crane but ends up being chased by the two. The pursuit {{ends up in the}} FBI garage and ends violently with Crane being run over and Rohrer crashing his car into the garage wall, going up in flames. Both men are presumed dead.|$|E
5|$|His father, Calvin T. Underwood, was a peach {{farmer in}} his home town of Gaffney who {{died at the age}} of 43 of a heart attack. The Underwoods lived in poverty, and nearly lost the farm when Frank was a child; to get a bank loan and avoid foreclosure, his father {{attended}} a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, of which the bank manager was a member. Underwood speaks fondly of his father in public, but this is a political ploy; in his asides to the audience, Underwood describes his father as a weak man who accomplished nothing with his life. He even urinates on his father's grave in season 3. Despite disliking his father, however, Underwood was influenced by him. Calvin was an abusive alcoholic and caused his wife and son years of misery. Underwood has said that when he was 13, he walked in on his father putting a shotgun in his mouth. Calvin asked him <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger,</b> which he refused to do. He has stated that his biggest regret is not killing his father when he had the chance.|$|E
25|$|July 2010, A {{stand-off}} in Rothbury between British {{police and}} armed fugitive Raoul Moat ended after two tasers were discharged, possibly causing Moat <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> {{to end his}} own life. An inquest is ongoing.|$|E

50|$|A single-shot {{percussion}} pocket pistol {{with the}} hammer {{in the more}} usual top position for contemporary pistols. The spectacular innovation was the 'double action' which allowed firing simply be <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> Most firearms {{of the day and}} for decades thereafter were 'single action', requiring the user to manually cock <b>the</b> firearm prior <b>to</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> <b>The</b> barrel had a smooth bore with no rifling. With no sights, this was a close range personal defense weapon used with a 'point and shoot' method rather than careful aiming. This model also introduced a screw barrel, allowing for easy disassembly and cleaning. Judging solely from patent dates, production of this pistol began around 1837 and continued beyond 1844 when a patent reissue was granted.|$|R
25|$|After {{completing}} an Escape section, {{the player}} {{needs to take}} a stance in a moral decision; one such decision involves one character being locked into a chair with a gun next to it and another character inside an incinerator. To stop the incinerator, the player needs to choose <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger,</b> which has a 50% possibility of firing a live bullet, killing the character in the chair. The way the decisions are made varies: some involve choosing between options, and some have the player input their own answer.|$|E
25|$|Attempting {{to replace}} Morales' bat, {{at least for}} the short term, the Angels nearly had a trade in place for Chicago Cubs first baseman Derrek Lee; however, even though the two parties agreed on the terms of the deal and were ready <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger,</b> Lee invoked his no-trade clause, and the deal was nixed. This move on Lee's part proved fatal for the Angels, as they never did find the right bat to replace Morales, ending the season with a record of 80–82, in third place and ten games behind the {{division}} champion (and eventually American League champion) Texas Rangers.|$|E
25|$|Afterward, Falcone calls Shank {{about an}} {{important}} hit: the deputy mayor {{is in town}} and he must be eliminated. By taking him out, the mob {{will be able to}} gain control. Shank and Falcone kill the deputy's final bodyguard, and are about to take the deputy out when Eva is taken hostage. Suddenly Shank is full of doubt, and is not able <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> Rudy (voiced by David Goldstein), Cesar's personal assistant, kills the deputy mayor, threatening to kill Eva since she's deemed as a nuisance. Shank quickly dives {{in front of her and}} kills him. Realizing they must flee, Eva and Shank drive off into the sunset. The player then hears the voice of Cesar who tells his assassins to find and kill them.|$|E
5000|$|Heinrich Himmler {{visited the}} {{outskirts}} of Minsk in 1941 to witness a mass shooting. He {{was told by the}} commanding officer there that the shootings were proving psychologically damaging to those being asked <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>triggers.</b> Thus Himmler knew another method of mass killing was required. [...] After the war, the diary of the Auschwitz Commandant, Rudolf Höss, revealed that psychologically [...] "unable to endure wading through blood any longer", many Einsatzkommandos - the killers - either went mad or killed themselves.|$|R
50|$|In March 2006, {{police arrested}} several alleged {{members of the}} Cordì family—a leading clan of the 'Ndrangheta—including the {{suspected}} current boss, Vincenzo Cordì, and Salvatore Ritorto, believed <b>to</b> have <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> in <b>the</b> killing of Fortugno.|$|R
50|$|Jackson, {{his mother}} Viola Jackson, and his 82-year-old {{grandfather}} Cager Lee, ran into Mack's Café behind the church, pursued by state troopers. Police clubbed Lee {{to the floor}} in the kitchen; when Viola attempted <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> police off, she was also beaten. When Jackson tried to protect his mother, one trooper threw him against a cigarette machine. A second trooper shot Jackson twice in the abdomen. James Bonard Fowler later admitted <b>to</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger,</b> saying he thought Jackson was going for his gun. The wounded Jackson fled the café, suffering additional blows by the police, and collapsed in front of the bus station.|$|R
25|$|Nina soon revived {{her role}} as an assassin, {{the only thing that}} she {{recalled}} from her previous life. Two years later, she was contracted by a Mafia syndicate to kill a famous British boxer, Steve Fox. However, she discovered that Steve was in fact her biological son, who was born through In vitro fertilisation during her years in cryosleep, with her gene is being used for Doctor Abel's Hybrid Gene experiment on children, including Steve, until the experiment was cancelled when most of children died during that experiment, except Steve and one of the surviving children, whose statuses are covered by the former Zaibatsu now G Corporation researcher Emma Kliesen (Leo's mother) from being watched by the Zaibatsu's eyes. At the last moment when she tried <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> to her rifle, she somehow and rarely regained her human emotions, and refused to kill Fox. she abandoned her assassination attempt after detective Lei Wulong brought down the syndicate. After the collapse of her employers, Nina no longer required a viable reason to pursue her target. It was also revealed that she remained emotionally impassive about the discovery of her biological son, but the fact that she did not kill him when the chance presented itself shows otherwise for some.|$|E
25|$|Pre-set hybrid {{triggers}} {{are similar}} to a DA/SA trigger in reverse. The first pull of the trigger is pre-set. If the striker or hammer fail to discharge the cartridge, the trigger may be pulled again and will operate as a double-action only (DAO) until the cartridge discharges or the malfunction is cleared. This allows the operator to attempt a second time to fire a cartridge after a misfire malfunction, {{as opposed to a}} single-action, in which the only thing to do if a round fails to fire is to rack the slide, clearing the round and recocking the hammer. While this can be advantageous in that many rounds will fire on being struck a second time, and it is faster <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> a second time than to cycle the action, if the round fails to fire on the second strike, the user will be forced to clear the round anyway, thus using up even more time than if they had simply done so in the first place. The Taurus PT 24/7 Pro pistol (not {{to be confused with the}} first-generation 24/7 which was a traditional pre-set) offered this feature starting in 2006. The Walther P99 Anti-Stress is another example.|$|E
500|$|Ralph summons his shipmates (Sir Joseph's female {{relatives}} also arrive) {{and tells}} {{them that he}} is bent on suicide. The crew expresses sympathy, except for Dick, who provides a stark counterpoint of dissent. Ralph puts a pistol to his head, but as he is about <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger,</b> Josephine enters, admitting that she loves him after all. Ralph and Josephine plan to sneak ashore to elope that night. Dick Deadeye warns them to [...] "forbear, nor carry out the scheme", but the joyous ship's company ignores him.|$|E
50|$|In March 2006, {{police arrested}} {{several members of}} the Cordì family, {{including}} the suspected current boss, Vincenzo Cordì, and Salvatore Ritorto, believed <b>to</b> have <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> in <b>the</b> killing of Francesco Fortugno, the Vice President of the Regional Assembly of Calabria, in October 2005.|$|R

5000|$|Eventually, Jerome finds a loose {{board that}} {{he tries to}} use to block the gun but when that is {{ineffective}} and he has lost all hope, he uses <b>the</b> board <b>to</b> help <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> <b>The</b> gun doesn't go off; it was fired when the building collapsed. Yet the potential firing was enough to send Jerome to his death.|$|R
500|$|Police {{were unable}} to recover any {{fingerprints}} from the well-oiled grip of the pistol, and a paraffin test for gunshot residue was not performed on Danna or Sharon Kinne. Multiple people, including family and neighbors, told police that James had often allowed Danna to play with his guns, and in a test by investigating officers, Danna proved able <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> on a gun matching {{the one that had}} killed her father. With no evidence to the contrary, investigators ruled the case an accidental homicide. The pistol that killed James Kinne was taken into police custody and never returned to the widow, despite her efforts to reclaim it; she later had a male friend secretly buy her a [...]22 caliber automatic pistol. When the friend told her that he had registered the gun in her name, she requested that he re-register it under a name other than hers.|$|E
500|$|Kafka {{worked out}} for the Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, New England Patriots, and Oakland Raiders prior to the draft. Mike Mayock called Kafka the [...] "sleeper" [...] of the quarterback class, {{projecting}} him to be drafted in the sixth round. Mayock also said, [...] "He's a really smart kid. Has a better arm than people think. I don't even think he's sleeping anymore. He was a month-and-a-half ago, but he's on the rise. He's a kid who could surprise people {{at the end of}} the day." [...] Former NFL quarterback Ron Jaworski concurred, saying that Kafka [...] "knows how to play the quarterback position. There's a real feel for hitting the open receiver, good anticipation. I can see him being one of those sleeper type guys." [...] A scout before the draft said that Kafka [...] "throws a lot of picks, but at least he's willing <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> You don't see that from a lot of young kids." ...|$|E
500|$|In the present, Ana Lucia starts {{questioning}} Henry Gale in the hatch, {{but suddenly}} he attacks her, {{and is only}} stopped when John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) knocks him unconscious. Locke asks Henry why he attacked Ana Lucia, but has never tried to hurt him. Henry says that Locke is [...] "one of the good ones". Although Libby (Cynthia Watros) advises Ana Lucia {{not to try to}} get revenge on Henry, she is determined and asks James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) for a gun, but is rejected. Ana Lucia returns and after Sawyer still refuses to give her a gun, she has sex with him, and is able to distract him long enough to steal the gun. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) return with Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau). Michael wakes up and tells everyone in the hatch that he tracked the Others down and found out that they are living worse off than the survivors. He also says that once he is healthy, he will organize a rescue mission to reclaim his son Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley). After Locke and Jack begin to plan a rescue mission for Walt, they realize that they need more guns, and go to Sawyer, who realizes that Ana Lucia has stolen his. Elsewhere, Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) has planned a romantic picnic for himself and Libby, but Hurley gets lost and leads them back to the survivors' beach. There, he realizes that he forgot to pack a blanket and Libby offers {{to go back to the}} hatch to retrieve one. She also suggests that Hurley ask Rose and Bernard for some wine for the picnic, a suggestion that Hurley is delighted to hear. Meanwhile, back in the hatch, Michael asks Ana Lucia what is going on and she explains a few things: Sawyer has all the guns, Jack, Locke, and Kate left to get the guns, and they currently have one of the Others, Henry, in captivity inside the armory. She mentions that Henry tried to kill her earlier in the day and that although she was about to kill Henry, she was not able <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> Michael offers to do it, but after she hands him the gun he turns around and shoots her dead. Libby walks in with the blankets and startles Michael causing him to shoot her too. Michael then walks into the armory where Henry is being held. Instead of shooting Henry, Michael shoots himself in the arm.|$|E

500|$|The defense, led by {{attorneys}} Martha Hickman and James Patrick Quinn, {{focused on}} the circumstantial quality of the prosecution's evidence, noting that prior police investigation had determined James Kinne's death to be [...] "obviously accidental" [...] and that the jury was obligated to assume innocence on the defendant's part no matter how unpleasant they found her moral character to be. The defense, too, attacked the reliability of John Boldizs's testimony, calling him a [...] "poor, mixed-up kid" [...] who would [...] "sign anything". Kinne's attorneys also presented testimony from witnesses supporting {{the viability of the}} theory that Danna Kinne had shot her father, including statements that guns had been regularly left within Danna's reach at the family home, that Danna was able <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>triggers</b> on toy guns with stiffer <b>trigger</b> <b>pulls</b> than <b>the</b> weapon that caused Kinne's death, and that Danna had often been observed pretending to fire guns in play.|$|R
50|$|The man {{believed}} <b>to</b> have <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> had reportedly known {{someone in}} Memphis. After robbing {{a bank in}} Florida, that person told the alleged triggerman to meet him over at Al Jackson's house.

2500|$|The Ruger Redhawk uses modern {{coil springs}} design instead of old-fashioned leaf springs {{that are found}} in most modern revolvers. [...] The revolvers also used a single spring for both the hammer and the trigger, and {{this meant that the}} force {{required}} <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> was higher than similar offerings from other manufacturers, {{and there was no way}} to adjust or correct this as it was inherent in the single-spring design.|$|E
2500|$|A single-action {{revolver}} {{requires the}} hammer {{to be pulled}} back by hand before each shot, which also revolves the cylinder. This leaves the trigger with just one [...] "single action" [...] left to perform - releasing the hammer to fire the shot - so the force and distance required <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> can be minimal. In contrast, with a self-cocking revolver, one long squeeze of the trigger pulls back the hammer and revolves the cylinder, then finally fires the shot. They can generally be fired faster than a single-action, but with reduced accuracy {{in the hands of}} most shooters.|$|E

5000|$|Hammerless and striker-fired, the Steyr M {{features}} a double action only (DAO) pre-set trigger mechanism marketed as a [...] "Reset Action" [...] <b>trigger.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> is in <b>the</b> forward position, {{the firing pin}} spring remains lightly compressed (pre-cocked by the forward motion of the slide as it returns <b>to</b> battery). <b>Pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> all <b>the</b> way to the back will compress the firing pin spring completely, draw the firing pin fully to the rear and position <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> bar to release the firing pin and fire a round. <b>The</b> <b>trigger</b> travel is 4 mm with a pull weight of 25 N.|$|R
2500|$|Neville Quin, {{husband of}} Janet, had escaped to the jetty area, but {{returned}} {{to look for}} his wife. He {{had been forced to}} leave her earlier after Bryant shot her. Bryant exited the coach and, spotting Quin, chased him around the coaches. Bryant fired at him at least twice before Quin ran onto a coach. Bryant entered the coach and pointed the gun at Neville Quin's face, saying, [...] "No one gets away from me". Mr Quin ducked when he realised Bryant was about <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> The bullet missed his head but hit his neck, momentarily paralysing him. After Bryant left, Quin managed to find his wife, although she later died in his arms. Neville Quin was eventually taken away by helicopter and survived.|$|E
2500|$|A form of periscope rifle {{was invented}} in May 1915 during the Gallipoli {{campaign}} by a British-born Australian soldier, Lance Corporal William Beech, a builder's foreman in civilian life. Beech was at time serving in the 2nd Battalion, Australian Imperial Force (AIF). The device allowed a soldier to aim and fire a rifle from a trench, without being exposed to enemy fire. Beech modified a standard Lee–Enfield [...]303 rifle by cutting the stock in half. The two halves were re-connected with a board and mirror periscope, horizontally aligned to the sights of the rifle, {{as well as a}} string <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger,</b> which allowed the rifle to be fired from beneath the line of fire. According to the testimony of John Adams, a private who served with Beech, the idea came to Beech after the dramatic experience of seeing the bodies of fellow soldiers shot through the head.|$|E

5000|$|The M1907 two-piece leather rifle sling was {{the most}} common type of sling used with the weapon through World War II. In 1943 a khaki canvas sling was {{introduced}} that gradually became more common. Another accessory was <b>the</b> winter <b>trigger,</b> developed during <b>the</b> Korean War. It consisted of a small mechanism installed on <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> guard, allowing <b>the</b> soldier <b>to</b> remotely <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> by depressing a lever just behind the guard.

5000|$|Hammer follow {{occurs when}} the {{disconnector}} allows the hammer to follow the bolt and firing pin into battery, sometimes causing the firing mechanism <b>to</b> function without <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> This is usually a result of extreme wear or outright breakage of firing mechanism components, and can result in uncontrollable [...] "full-auto" [...] operation, in which multiple rounds are discharged following a single <b>pull</b> of <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b>|$|R
