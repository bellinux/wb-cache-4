25|$|Later, when {{telephony}} {{began to}} replace telegraphy, {{it was found}} that the currents in the earth induced by power systems, electrical railways, other telephone and telegraph circuits, and natural sources including lightning caused unacceptable interference to the audio signals, and the <b>two-wire</b> or 'metallic circuit' system was reintroduced around 1883.|$|E
25|$|Both {{hard-wired}} (cable) and through-water electronic voice {{communications systems}} {{may be used}} with surface supplied diving. Wired systems are more popular {{as there is a}} physical connection to the diver for gas supply in any case, and adding a cable does not make the system any different to handle. Wired communications systems are still more reliable and simpler to maintain than through-water systems. The communications equipment is relatively straightforward and may be of the <b>two-wire</b> or four-wire type. Two wire systems use the same wires for surface to diver and diver to surface messages, whereas four wire systems allow the diver's messages and the surface operator's messages to use separate wire pairs.|$|E

2500|$|GFCIs are {{commonly}} available {{as an integral}} part of a receptacle or a circuit breaker installed in the distribution panelboard.

In both Canada and the US older <b>two-wire,</b> ungrounded NEMA 1 receptacles may be replaced with NEMA 5 receptacles protected by a GFCI (integral with the receptacle or with the corresponding circuit breaker) in lieu of rewiring the entire circuit with a grounding conductor. In such cases the receptacles must be labeled [...] "no equipment ground" [...] and [...] "GFCI protected"; GFCI manufacturers typically provide tags for the appropriate installation description.|$|E
2500|$|Italian {{railways}} {{were the}} first in the world to introduce electric traction for the entire length of a main line rather than just a short stretch. The 106km Valtellina line was opened on 4 September 1902, designed by Kandó and a team from the Ganz works. The electrical system was three-phase at 3kV 15Hz. The voltage was significantly higher than used earlier and it required new designs for electric motors and switching devices. The three-phase <b>two-wire</b> system was used on several railways in Northern Italy and became known as [...] "the Italian system". Kandó was invited in 1905 to undertake the management of Società Italiana Westinghouse and led the development of several Italian electric locomotives. During the period of electrification of the Italian railways, tests were made as to which type of power to use: in some sections there was a 3,600V Hz three-phase power supply, in others there was 1,500VDC, 3kVDC and 10kVAC45Hz supply. After WW2, 3 kVDC power was chosen for the entire Italian railway system. 1,500 V DC is still used on some lines near France and 25 kV 50Hz is used by high-speed trains.|$|E

(For example, one adapter only handles paths whose lengths are multiples of seven bits.) Some layers built {{on top of}} JTAG monitor the state transitions, and use uncommon paths to trigger higher level operations. Some ARM cores use such sequences to enter and exit a <b>two-wire</b> (non-JTAG) SWD mode.
