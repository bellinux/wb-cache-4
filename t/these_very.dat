5|$|A {{nitrogen}} atom {{has seven}} electrons. In the ground state, they {{are arranged in}} the electron configuration 1s2s2p2p2p. It therefore has five valence electrons in the 2s and 2p orbitals, three of which (the p-electrons) are unpaired. It {{has one of the}} highest electronegativities among the elements (3.04 on the Pauling scale), exceeded only by chlorine (3.16), oxygen (3.44), and fluorine (3.98). Following periodic trends, its single-bond covalent radius of 71pm is smaller than those of boron (84pm) and carbon (76pm), while it is larger than those of oxygen (66pm) and fluorine (57pm). The nitride anion, N3−, is much larger at 146pm, similar to that of the oxide (O2−: 140pm) and fluoride (F−: 133pm) anions. The first three ionisation energies of nitrogen are 1.402, 2.856, and 4.577MJ·mol−1, and the sum of the fourth and fifth is 16.920MJ·mol−1. Due to <b>these</b> <b>very</b> high figures, nitrogen has no simple cationic chemistry.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Raskolnikov's mother, Pulkheria Alexandrovna, and his sister, Avdotya Romanovna (or Dunya), {{have arrived}} in the city. Dunya had been working as a governess for the Svidrigaïlov family until this point, but was {{forced out of the}} {{position}} by the head of the family, Arkady Ivanovich Svidrigaïlov. Svidrigaïlov, a married man, was attracted to Dunya's physical beauty and her feminine qualities, and offered her riches and elopement. Mortified, Dunya fled the Svidrigaïlov family and lost her source of income, only to meet Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin, a man of modest income and rank. Luzhin proposes to marry Dunya, thereby securing her and her mother's financial safety, provided she accept him quickly and without question. It is for <b>these</b> <b>very</b> reasons {{that the two of them}} come to Saint Petersburg, both to meet Luzhin there and to obtain Raskolnikov's approval. Luzhin, however, calls on Raskolnikov while he is in a delirious state and presents himself as a foolish, self-righteous and presumptuous man. Raskolnikov dismisses him immediately as a potential husband for his sister, and realizes that she only accepted him to help her family.|$|E
5|$|The mid-to-late 1970s saw {{a decline}} in Celtic's European achievements, with first-round exits in the European Cup against Olympiacos in 1974 and in the UEFA Cup against Wisła Kraków in 1976. In between <b>these</b> <b>very</b> brief campaigns, Celtic reached the quarter-finals of the Cup Winners' Cup in season 1975–76, but disappointingly were knocked out by East German side Sachsenring Zwickau, whose play was unimpressive despite winning the tie. The tie is best remembered for the bizarre {{situation}} where young Roy Aitken had to be 'adopted' by Celtic {{to be allowed to}} enter East Germany to play the away leg. At only 17 years old, the authorities there did not consider him to be an adult. Celtic's last European campaign under Jock Stein was again very short, a second round exit against Wacker Innsbruck in the 1977–78 European Cup.|$|E
5|$|The 20th Panzer and 6th Infantry Divisions of the XLVII Panzer Corps, {{spearheaded the}} advance of the XLVII Panzer Corps. Behind them the {{remaining}} two panzer divisions followed, ready to exploit any breakthrough. The heavily mined terrain and fortified positions of the 15th Rifle Division slowed the advance. By 08:00 safe lanes had been cleared through the minefield. That morning information obtained from prisoner interrogation identified a weakness at the boundary of the 15th and 81st Rifle Divisions caused by the German preliminary bombardment. The Tigers were redeployed and struck towards this area. Red Army formations countered with a force of around 90 T-34s. In the resulting three-hour battle, Red Army armoured units lost 42 tanks while the Germans lost two Tigers and a further five more immobilized with track damage. While the Red Army counter-attack was defeated and the first defensive belt breached, the fighting had delayed the Germans {{long enough for the}} rest of 29th Rifle Corps of the 13th Army – initially deployed behind the first belt – to move forward and seal the breach. Red Army minefields were covered by artillery fire, making efforts to clear paths through the fields difficult and costly. Goliath and Borgward IV remote-controlled engineer mine-clearing vehicles met with limited success. Of the 653rd Heavy Panzerjäger Battalion's 45 Ferdinands sent into battle, all but 12 of them were immobilized by mine damage before 17:00. Most of these were later repaired and returned to service, but the recovery of <b>these</b> <b>very</b> large vehicles was difficult.|$|E

25|$|In other areas, grammar schools survive {{mainly as}} very highly {{selective}} schools {{in an otherwise}} comprehensive county, for example {{in several of the}} outer boroughs of London. These schools are often heavily oversubscribed, and award places in rank order of performance in their entry tests.

25|$|Unlike {{some parts}} of Isabela like Santiago City, Echague and Alicia {{the history of the}} {{municipality}} of Quezon is relatively recent.
