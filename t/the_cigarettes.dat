5|$|Bond {{is a heavy}} smoker, at {{one point}} smoking 70 {{cigarettes}} a day. Bond has his cigarettes custom-made by Morland of Grosvenor Street, mixing Balkan and Turkish tobacco and having a higher nicotine content than normal; <b>the</b> <b>cigarettes</b> have three gold bands on the filter. Bond carried his cigarettes in a wide gunmetal cigarette case which carried fifty; he also used a black oxidised Ronson lighter. <b>The</b> <b>cigarettes</b> {{were the same as}} Fleming's, who had been buying his at Morland since the 1930s; the three gold bands on the filter were added during the war to mirror his naval Commander's rank. On average, Bond smokes sixty cigarettes a day, although he cut back to around twenty five a day after his visit to a health farm in Thunderball: Fleming himself smoked up to 80 cigarettes a day.|$|E

25|$|Abbott's {{investigations}} {{have led to}} questions concerning the assumptions police had made on the case.

However, a check of government gazettes of the day indicated that Kensitas were actually the expensive brand, which opens the possibility (never investigated) that the source of the poison may have been in <b>the</b> <b>cigarettes</b> that were possibly substituted for the victim's own without his knowledge.

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{mechanism}} for <b>the</b> generation of <b>cigarette</b> smoke, <b>the</b> combustion mechanism of a burning cigarette during a puff was investigated by focusing on air transfer. In particular, the air flow distribution outside a burning cigarette was observed and related to the aerodynamic effects of <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> paper and <b>the</b> puffing rate. The air flow rate was measured by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), using olive oil droplets as the tracer particles. It was found that air does not flow into the tip of <b>the</b> burning <b>cigarette</b> and that <b>the</b> air flow was concentrated at the region - 2 to 2 mm around <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> paper char-line. This behavior was independent of <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> paper basis weight. When the puffing rate was changed from 2. 5 to 35 mL/s, the air flow was concentrated at a region close to <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> paper char-line and the maximum velocity around <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> paper char-line increased with the puffing rate...|$|R

40|$|Propylene glycol (PG) is {{a common}} {{humectant}} added to the tobacco used in cigarettes, and part of this compound is transferred to smoke. The influence of this additive on the retention of solanesol by smokers has been evaluated {{in the present study}} for two <b>cigarettes</b> having <b>the</b> same tobacco blend except for the 3 % addition of PG on one of them. <b>The</b> <b>cigarette</b> with no PG was a commercial brand, and the experimental one was made using the same tobacco blend as <b>the</b> commercial <b>cigarette,</b> but adding 3 % of PG. The construction of <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> with 3 % PG allowed to match as close as possible the ‘tar’ [as measured by Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regimen], pressure drop (open and closed), and nicotine level of <b>the</b> commercial <b>cigarette.</b> <b>The</b> number of human subjects taking the test was ten smokers for each of the two evaluated products. The sample collection was performed from three cigarettes smoked within one hour. The same human subject smoked <b>the</b> regular <b>cigarette</b> and then <b>the</b> one with added PG. The exhaled smoke was collected using a vacuum assisted procedure that avoids strain in exhaling, and the solanesol was analyzed using an high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique. <b>The</b> <b>cigarette</b> butts from <b>the</b> smokers were collected and also analyzed for solanesol. The results obtained for <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> butts from <b>the</b> smokers were used to calculate the level of solanesol in the smoke delivered to the human subject, based on calibration curves. These curves were generated separately by analyzing the solanesol in smoke and in <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> butts obtained by machine smoking under different puffing regimes. Knowing the delivered amount of solanesol and that in the exhaled smoke it was possible to calculate the retention of this compound from mainstream smoke for <b>the</b> two <b>cigarette</b> types. <b>The</b> levels of solanesol delivered to <b>the</b> smoker from <b>Cigarette</b> A was in the range between 350. 4 ìg/cig and 504. 8 ìg/cig for <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> with no PG, and between 401. 5 ìg/cig and 614. 1 ìg/cig for <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> with 3 % PG added. The amount of solanesol retained by <b>the</b> smoker (per <b>cigarette)</b> was on an average 309 ìg/cig with 15. 8 % relative standard deviation for <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> with no PG, and an average of 348 ìg/cig with 20. 4 % relative standard deviation for the 3 % PG cigarette. An ANOVA single factor analysis showed that the results between <b>the</b> two <b>cigarettes</b> were not statistically different for 95 % confidence. The retention of solanesol from <b>the</b> commercial <b>cigarette</b> showed an average of 72. 5 % with 11. 7 % relative standard deviation, and <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> with 3 % added PG showed an average retention of 70. 8 % with 14. 5 % relative standard deviation. ANOVA single factor analysis indicated no significant differences in the retention % of solanesol for <b>the</b> two <b>cigarettes</b> at 95 % confidence.

500|$|Goebbels became {{preoccupied with}} morale {{and the efforts}} {{of the people on the}} home front. He {{believed}} that the more the people at home were involved in the war effort, the better their morale would be. For example, he initiated a programme for the collection of winter clothing and ski equipment for troops on the eastern front. At the same time, Goebbels implemented changes to have more [...] "entertaining material" [...] in radio and film produced for the public, decreeing in late 1942 that 20 per cent of the films should be propaganda and 80 per cent light entertainment. As Gauleiter of Berlin, Goebbels dealt with increasingly serious shortages of necessities such as food and clothing, as well as the need to ration beer and tobacco, which were important for morale. Hitler suggested watering the beer and degrading the quality of <b>the</b> <b>cigarettes</b> so that more could be produced, but Goebbels refused, saying <b>the</b> <b>cigarettes</b> were already of such low quality that it was impossible to make them any worse. Through his propaganda campaigns, he worked hard to maintain an appropriate level of morale among the public about the military situation, neither too optimistic nor too grim. The series of military setbacks the Germans suffered in this period – the thousand-bomber raid on Cologne (May 1942), the Allied victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein (November 1942), and especially the catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad (February 1943) – were difficult matters to present to the German public, who were increasingly weary of the war and skeptical that it could be won. On 15 January 1943, Hitler appointed Goebbels as head of the newly created Air Raid Damage committee, which meant Goebbels was nominally in charge of nationwide civil air defenses and shelters as well as the assessment and repair of damaged buildings. In actuality, the defence of areas other than Berlin remained in the hands of the local Gauleiters, and his main tasks were limited to providing immediate aid to the affected civilians and using propaganda to improve their morale.|$|E
