5|$|June 30, 2010– Tropical Storm Alex {{passes through}} the area {{affected}} by <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill, causing tarballs from the spill as large as apples to wash onshore portions of the panhandle from high storm tides created by the storm.|$|E
5|$|Following the April 2010 {{destruction}} of <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> while drilling the Macondo well, {{and the resulting}} oil spill, all appraisal activities at 33 wells under exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, including Tiber, were placed on hold. At least two rigs that might otherwise {{have been used for}} developing Tiber are also in use on the relief wells for the ruptured well.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocarbon {{exploration}} {{in deep water}} occasionally results in significant environmental degradation resulting mainly from accumulation of contaminated drill cuttings, but also from oil spills. While the oil gusher involved in <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico originates from a wellhead only 1500meters below the ocean surface, it nevertheless illustrates the kind of environmental disaster that can result from mishaps related to offshore drilling for oil and gas.|$|E

5|$|The school {{operates}} the F.G. Walton Smith research vessel. Designed to met the school's specifications, the catamaran {{was put on}} water in 2000. It {{is equipped with a}} special sea water flow system that can take samples. The on-board lab can perform chemical analysis of those water samples. It also has transducers for measuring ocean currents, sub-bottom profiling, and deep water bathymetry. In response to <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill, the vessel was reassigned to environmental monitoring of affected areas and to track underwater plumes of oil.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm was}} {{expected}} to impact operations regarding <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> Oil Spill, with both containment and cleanup operations being affected by repercussions from the storm (such as wave action and wind direction). Although Alex stayed relatively away from the site, the storm caused BP to delay plans to increase oil capture from the leak by a week. Tarballs from the spill as large as apples washed onshore around Grand Isle, {{as well as other}} parts of Louisiana, Alabama and Florida, from high storm tides created by the hurricane.|$|E

In 2004, {{the company was}} awarded a $1.1 billion project with AMEC to help rebuild the water, power and civic {{infrastructure}} of Iraq after the Iraq War. Fluor has also built a rail line in Europe and missile sites in Arizona. The company provided disaster recovery services in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina. In 2010 Fluor provided workers to clean up oil tar on beaches in Florida and Alabama after <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill. In December 2012, Fluor was awarded a $3.14 billion contract {{to build a new}} Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Five was an Atlantic {{tropical}} cyclone {{that lasted for}} 12hours, although its remnants persisted for almost another week. Its precursor was from a non-tropical trough east of Florida, and on August10 it developed in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. It was the fifth depression of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. The system was declassified as a {{tropical cyclone}} the following day, a remnant circulation later moved over Louisiana and Mississippi, producing heavy rainfall and causing flooding. Along the Florida coast, the system produced heavy waves that contributed to two deaths. Moving inland, {{the remnants of the}} depression reached central Alabama before turning southward. The system nearly redeveloped into a tropical cyclone on August16 after it again reached the Gulf of Mexico, but it became disorganized and turned northward into Mississippi. The depression twice caused BP to delay work in building a relief well to combat <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> oil spill.|$|E

Despite pushback from oil companies and states, the Supreme Court ruled to keep the moratorium in place until October 2010. BP agreed to financial compensation for the damage they caused, including payouts to <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> <b>Horizon</b> Oil Spill Trust. Regulations drafted after the accident required oil companies to update their safety equipment, including blowout preventers. This measure was criticized as too costly to integrate and thus harmful to industry and job growth, so it has been weakly enforced.|$|E
