2500|$|On April 7, 1983, Major League Baseball, ABC, and NBC {{agreed to}} {{terms of a}} six-year {{television}} package worth $1.2 billion. The two networks continued to alternate coverage of the playoffs (ABC in even numbered years and NBC in odd numbered years), World Series (ABC televised the World Series in odd numbered years and NBC in even numbered years), and All-Star Game (ABC televised the All-Star Game in even numbered years and NBC in odd numbered years) through the 1989 season, {{with each of the}} 26 clubs receiving $7 million per year in return. The last package gave each club $1.9 million per year. ABC contributed $575 million for regular season prime time and Sunday afternoons and NBC paid $550 million for thirty Saturday afternoon games. It should be noted that ABC was contracted to televise 20 prime time regular season games a year in addition to other games (the aforementioned Sunday afternoon games). But ABC didn't come close to using that many, which meant they actually paid for games they weren't showing. <b>To</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> perspective, ABC televised six prime time games in 1984 and eight 1985. They planned to again televise eight prime time games in 1986.|$|E

40|$|It is a {{privilege}} to appear as lecturer on this platform honoring a noted American law professor, Edwin A. Mooers, particularly when it is in succession to the first lecturer of the series, the Dean of American legal scholars, Roscoe Pound. 1 I recognize my temerity in venturing a new discussion of a topic which Pound and Cardozo have so definitively explored in modern times and which has stimulated lively thinking from at least the time of Aristotle. My excuse {{is not only the}} continuous fascination of the subject, but also the fact that after all these years of legal realism, frankly, even brutally, stripping the process of decision-making of all illusion, there appears to be rising a new wave of mysticism to bemuse the scholars, confuse the judges, and intrigue us all. Each generation, it seems, must work out anew its theories of the judicial process. Let me assure you that I have no new revelations <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you,</b> only <b>some</b> unoriginal bromides, which seem in danger of being overlooked. My aim is to bring the discussion back to a pragmatic and practical level which will be of utility to those on the firing front. For a near quarter century of judging following two decades of teaching in the fields of law administration and legal procedure, if they have not given me final wisdom, have at least brought conviction that we should return the business of judging to the judges, unfettered by either abstract philosophy or mechanical rules of certainty and objectivity...|$|R

6000|$|... 30. All this we {{have from}} the legends of the {{historic}} Æolus only; but, besides these, there is the beautiful story of Semele, the mother of Bacchus. She is the cloud with {{the strength of the}} vine in its bosom, consumed by the light which matures the fruit; the melting away of the cloud into the clean air at the fringe of its edges being exquisitely rendered by Pindar's epithet for her, Semele, [...] "with the stretched-out hair" [...] ('tauuetheira'.) Then there is the entire tradition of the Danaides, and of the tower of Danaë and golden shower; the birth of Perseus connecting this legend with that of the Gorgons and Graiæ, who are the true clouds of thunderous ruin and tempest. I must, in passing, mark for you that the form of the sword or sickle of Perseus, with which he kills Medusa, is another image of the whirling harpy vortex, and belongs especially to the sword of destruction or annihilation; whence it is <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the two angels who gather for destruction the evil harvest and evil vintage of the earth (Rev. xiv. 15). I will collect afterwards and complete what I have already written respecting the Pegasean and Gorgonian legends, noting here only what is necessary to explain the central myth of Athena herself, who represents the ambient air, which included all cloud, and rain, and dew, and darkness, and peace, and wrath of heaven. Let me now try <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you,</b> however briefly, <b>some</b> distinct idea of the several agencies of this great goddess.|$|R

You thought me a fool, I know, and compared with you I am; {{but you do not}} understand what an amount of hatred even a fool is capable of. For twenty years, Lady Bellamy, I have hated you, you will never know how much, though perhaps what I am going <b>to</b> say may <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> idea. I very well knew what terms you were on with George Caresfoot, you never took any pains to hide them from me, you only hid the proofs. I soon discovered indeed that your marriage to me was nothing but a blind, that I was being used as a screen forsooth. But your past I could never fathom. I don't look like a revengeful man, but for all that I have for years sought many ways to ruin you both, yet from one thing and another they all failed, till a blessed chance made that brute's blind passion the instrument of his own destruction, and put you into my hands. You little thought when you told me all that story, and begged my advice, how I was revelling in the sense that, proud woman as you are, it must have been an agony of humiliation for you to have to tell it. It was an instructive scene that, it assured me of what I suspected before that George Caresfoot must have you bound to him by some stronger ties than those of affection, that he must hold you in a grip of iron. It made me think, too, that if by any means I could acquire the same power, I too should be able to torture you." ...|$|R
