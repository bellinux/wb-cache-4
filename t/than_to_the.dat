5|$|As head of state, Hitler became supreme {{commander}} of the armed forces. The traditional loyalty oath of servicemen was altered to affirm loyalty to Hitler personally, by name, rather <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> office of supreme commander or the state. On 19 August, the merger of the presidency with the chancellorship was approved by 88 {{percent of the electorate}} voting in a plebiscite.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{superficial}} {{similarities in}} appearance, the cattle egret is {{more closely related}} to the genus Ardea, which comprises the great or typical herons and the great egret (A. alba), <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> majority of species termed egrets in the genus Egretta. Rare cases of hybridization with little blue herons Egretta caerulea, little egrets Egretta garzetta and snowy egrets Egretta thula have been recorded.|$|E

5|$|According to the Parliamentary paper Misc. 5 of 1966, the {{background}} of the ensign is red with the ratio of its width to its length being one by two. In contrast, the ratio of the national flag of Singapore is two by three. In the centre of the ensign is a white ring, which surrounds a crescent and five stars also coloured white. The five stars are arranged such that they form a pentagon in the middle. The crescent and stars are taken from the national flag, although in the ensign the crescent appears underneath rather <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left of the stars. According to a 1999 circular National Colours for Singapore Ships issued by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the red colour of the civil ensign is {{the same as that of}} the national flag. The shade of red has been defined by the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts as Pantone 032.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of {{perceived}} provocations from Prussia, culminating in the offer of the Spanish crown to the Prussian Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern, the French emperor Napoleon III declared war on 15 July 1870. Initially, this step was supported by an outbreak of patriotic fervour and confident expectations of victory. Bizet, along with other composers and artists, joined the National Guard and began training. He was critical of the antiquated equipment with which {{he was supposed to}} fight; his unit's guns, he said, were more dangerous to themselves <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> enemy. The national mood was soon depressed by news of successive reverses; at Sedan on 2 September, the French armies suffered an overwhelming defeat; Napoleon was captured and deposed, and the Second Empire came to a sudden end.|$|E
5|$|Analyses since 2001 have {{concluded}} that Eumetazoa (more complex than sponges) are {{more closely related to}} particular groups of sponges <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest of the sponges. Such conclusions imply that sponges are not monophyletic, because the last common ancestor of all sponges would also be a direct ancestor of the Eumetazoa, which are not sponges. A study in 2001 based on comparisons of ribosome DNA concluded that the most fundamental division within sponges was between glass sponges and the rest, and that Eumetazoa are more closely related to calcareous sponges, those with calcium carbonate spicules, than to other types of sponge. In 2007 one analysis based on comparisons of RNA and another based mainly on comparison of spicules concluded that demosponges and glass sponges are more closely related to each other than either is to calcareous sponges, which in turn are more closely related to Eumetazoa.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} his {{lifetime}} the Linnean collection in Uppsala was considered one of the finest collections of natural history objects in Sweden. Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala, which was supplied by material donated by Carl Gyllenborg (in 1744–1745), crown-prince Adolf Fredrik (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerström (in 1748 and 1750) and Jonas Alströmer (in 1749). The relation between the museum and the private collection was not formalised and the steady flow of material from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the private collection rather <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> museum. Linnaeus felt his work was reflecting the harmony of nature and he said in 1754 'the earth is then nothing else but a museum of the all-wise creator's masterpieces, divided into three chambers'. He had turned his own estate into a microcosm of that 'world museum'.|$|E
5|$|Balaenidae {{consists}} of two genera: Eubalaena (right whales) and Balaena (the bowhead whale, B. mysticetus). Balaenidae was thought to have consisted of only one genus until studies done through the early 2000s reported that bowhead whales and right whales are morphologically (different skull shape) and phylogenically different. According to a study done by H. C. Rosenbaum (of the American Museum of Natural History) and colleagues, the North Pacific (E. japonica) and Southern right (E. australis) whales are {{more closely related to}} each other <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis).|$|E
5|$|Before {{the battle}} was over, Hitler {{and several of his}} {{followers}} killed themselves. The city's garrison surrendered on 2 May but fighting continued to the north-west, west, and south-west of the city {{until the end of the}} war in Europe on 8 May (9 May in the Soviet Union) as some German units fought westward so that they could surrender to the Western Allies rather <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviets.|$|E

5|$|British ornithologist David Lack {{considered}} that the Puerto Rican amazon had {{evolved from the}} Hispaniolan amazon (A. ventralis) found in Hispaniola, but it has since been argued that he omitted some elements in his analysis, including the similarities found between the black-billed amazon (A. agilis) of Jamaica and the Puerto Rican amazon. Subsequent studies showed that size and color patterns were not sufficient to assess evolutionary relationships, and that patterns changed with relative ease even within {{members of the same}} species. The research concluded that the Puerto Rican amazon may share a common ancestor with the Jamaican A. agilis. Recent phylogenetic studies show that the Puerto Rican amazon is more closely related to the Hispaniolan amazon and the Cuban amazon <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> black-billed amazon.|$|E
5|$|By 26 April, {{the complex}} at Obersalzberg was {{under attack by}} the Allies, so Göring was moved to his castle at Mauterndorf. In his last will and testament, Hitler {{expelled}} Göring from the party and formally rescinded the decree making him his successor. He then appointed Karl Dönitz, the Navy's commander-in-chief, {{as president of the}} Reich and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Hitler and his wife, Eva Braun, committed suicide on 30 April 1945, a few hours after a hastily arranged wedding. Göring was freed on 5 May by a passing Luftwaffe unit, and {{he made his way to}} the American lines in hopes of surrendering to them rather <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Russians. He was taken into custody near Radstadt on 6 May by elements of the 36th Infantry Division of the United States Army. This move likely saved Göring's life; Bormann had ordered him executed if Berlin had fallen.|$|E
5|$|By November 1987, Castro began {{spending}} {{more time on the}} Angolan Civil War, in which the Marxists had fallen into retreat. Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos successfully appealed for more Cuban troops, with Castro later admitting that he devoted more time to Angola <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> domestic situation, believing that a victory would lead to the collapse of apartheid. Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign troops would pull out of Angola. Castro was angered by Gorbachev's approach, believing that he was abandoning the plight of the world's poor in favor of détente.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the {{assessment}} process for the ten routes, two remained. One was route 1, the original suggestion which used the existing course of the South Forty-Foot Drain for most of its length, while the second was a new route, designated as route 11. Route 11 had become the preferred route by the summer of 2014. It involves widening the South Forty-Foot Drain from Donington to Surfleet, to a point near to the Black Hole Drove pumping station. A new lock would be needed at this location, but would connect to a new channel, rather <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest of the drain. It would pass under a new bridge on the A151, and the connection to the River Glen would involve another new lock. An environmental survey of other watercourses near to the route revealed that several provide habitat for nationally important plants and invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Charles, Prince Elector and Duke of Bavaria, {{claimed the}} German territories of the Habsburg dynasty as a {{son-in-law}} of Joseph I, and furthermore presented himself as Charles VI's legitimate imperial successor. If women {{were going to}} inherit, he claimed, then his family should have precedence: his wife, Maria Amalia, {{was the daughter of}} Joseph I. Both Charles VI and his predecessor Joseph I had died without sons. Charles of Bavaria suggested that the legitimate succession pass to Joseph's female children, rather <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> daughters of the younger brother, Charles VI. For different reasons, Prussia, France, Spain and the Polish-Saxon monarchy supported Charles of Bavaria's claim to the Habsburg territory and the Imperial title and reneged on the Pragmatic Sanction.|$|E
