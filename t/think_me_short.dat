6000|$|... "Ha! that's a fair {{slap in the}} face," [...] said Tim, with a laugh, [...] "but {{there may}} be reasons for that, you see. Gals ain't always as willin' as they should be; {{sometimes}} they don't know a good man when they see him. Besides, I ain't too old yet, though p'raps some of 'em <b>thinks</b> <b>me</b> raither <b>short</b> for a husband. Come now, don't keep yer old comrade in the dark. Haven't ye got a notion o' some young woman in partikler?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I {{have done}} this for you, will you do {{something}} for me. I want to dream away the little time I am likely to have left here in my own way. Be a merciful Mother Oldershaw, and spare me the worry {{of looking at the}} Ins and Outs, and adding up the chances For and Against, in this new venture of mine. <b>Think</b> for <b>me,</b> in <b>short,</b> until I am obliged to think for myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Howard {{will not}} <b>think</b> <b>me</b> presumptuous, if I remind her {{that there was}} a time when she did not <b>think</b> <b>me</b> unworthy to be {{entrusted}} with her person and happiness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I thought I {{might just}} try,' pursued he, disconsolately, 'whether she did <b>think</b> <b>me</b> any steadier. I hope {{she did not}} <b>think</b> <b>me</b> very troublesome. I tried not to harass her much.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} will never <b>think</b> well of <b>me</b> any more. You will <b>think</b> <b>me</b> a liar. You will <b>think</b> <b>me</b> dishonest. You will think I didn't care for you, or your father and mother. You always do make the worst of me, I know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, look here! I {{am going}} to tell you {{something}} that will rather surprise you, and that perhaps will make you <b>think</b> <b>me</b> not quite as shrewd as you usually do <b>think</b> <b>me.</b> I intend to marry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And in {{no other}} sense," [...] he asked, [...] "you <b>think</b> <b>me</b> serious? You <b>think</b> <b>me</b> a flaneur who lets fall {{occasional}} truths. You {{do not think that}} in a deeper, a more deadly sense, I am serious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] I smiled, [...] "for {{the way you}} say it. If you don't, as you say, {{understand}} me," [...] I insisted, [...] "it's {{because you}} <b>think</b> <b>me</b> crazy. And if you <b>think</b> <b>me</b> crazy I don't {{see how you can}} leave me." ...|$|R
50|$|They used to <b>think</b> <b>me</b> wonderful.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes! Don't <b>think</b> <b>me</b> presuming; only <b>think</b> <b>me</b> vain. I can't {{hear you}} say too often that you have learned to like me. Is it really a {{pleasure}} to you to have me in the house? Have I always behaved well since I have been with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{instantly}} relented a little. [...] "You mustn't <b>think</b> <b>me</b> unreasonable. But I {{was determined}} to carry my undertaking through on business principles, and you have spoiled my chance--I know you meant it kindly or, if not spoiled, made it more difficult. Don't <b>think</b> <b>me</b> ungrateful. Mr. Merriam--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Somehow, Anne, I don't {{want him}} to <b>think</b> <b>me</b> frivolous. This is ridiculous. Why should I care what a tow-haired person called Jonas, whom I never saw before <b>thinks</b> of <b>me?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>think</b> to pose <b>me</b> with <b>short</b> questions; {{your case}} and mine are {{diametrically}} different, {{and it is}} nonsense attempting to draw a parallel. I say, that when a man endures patiently {{what ought to be}} unendurable, he is a fossil." ...|$|R
60|$|He laughed again. “Look here, Wiltshire, do you <b>think</b> <b>me</b> a fool?” he asked.|$|R
60|$|JOHN. The {{only thing}} I {{know about her}} is that she <b>thinks</b> <b>me</b> vulgar.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!" [...] cried Brown, {{frowning}} {{more and}} more, with a quite unusual concentration of curiosity. [...] "Don't <b>think</b> <b>me</b> rude. Let <b>me</b> <b>think</b> this {{out for a}} moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Because, Venetia, perhaps,' and Lord Cadurcis hesitated, 'perhaps {{you would}} <b>think</b> {{differently}} of <b>me?</b> I mean perhaps your feelings towards me might; ah, Venetia! perhaps you might <b>think</b> <b>me</b> worthy of you; perhaps you might love me.' ...|$|R
60|$|I am {{very very}} {{glad that you}} <b>think</b> <b>me</b> {{stronger}} and more perspicuous. For the perspicuity, I have struggled hard....|$|R
60|$|I hope Miss Heard {{received}} her copy, {{and that you}} will not <b>think</b> <b>me</b> arrogant in writing freely to you.|$|R
6000|$|He promised, however, that {{he would}} go down to Hampton {{immediately}} after the marriage, and he sent his kindest love to Linda and Katie. 'And, dear Mrs. Woodward,' said he, 'I know you <b>think</b> <b>me</b> very harsh, I know you <b>think</b> <b>me</b> vindictive--but pray, pray believe that I understand all your love, and acknowledge all your goodness. The time will, perhaps, come when we shall be as happy together as we once were.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot bear {{to think}} of leaving this place without seeing you again. I wished for one thing--please don't <b>think</b> <b>me</b> very egotistical for saying it--to tell you about some little papers I am writing, {{and one or two}} of which have been printed in a periodical. I think the subject would {{interest}} you. Will you <b>think</b> <b>me</b> very bold, Miss Churton, if I ask you to let me call on you at your home?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Groucho: I suppose youll <b>think</b> <b>me</b> {{a sentimental}} old fluff, {{but would you}} mind giving me a lock of your hair? ...|$|R
60|$|P.S.--I am {{a little}} {{apprehensive}} that your Lordship will <b>think</b> <b>me</b> too lenient towards these men, and half a frame-breaker myself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I trow not! He <b>thinks</b> <b>me</b> at Tantallon, {{watching}} for the raid the Mackays are threatening--little guessing the bird would be flown.' ...|$|R
60|$|CLEOPATRA (hopefully). Then we will cheat him. I {{will put}} on Ftatateeta's head-dress; {{and he will}} <b>think</b> <b>me</b> quite an old woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{delight in}} her mother. You <b>think</b> <b>me</b> more disinterested than I am," [...] Sherringham {{added with a}} certain soreness of irritation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} some day--you won't <b>think</b> <b>me</b> very rude?" [...] asked Barton--"you would mind telling {{me a little}} of your history?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure," [...] replied Dorn, amiably, as {{he started}} away. [...] "I suppose you <b>think</b> <b>me</b> one of these I-dare-you-to-make-me-laugh sort of chaps." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>think</b> <b>me</b> generous, madam," [...] said he. [...] "Do not misapprehend me. I am not. I covet {{neither the}} title nor estates of Ostermore. Their {{possession}} {{would be a}} thorn in my flesh, a thorn of bitter memory. That {{is one reason why}} you should not <b>think</b> <b>me</b> generous, though it is not the reason why I cede them. I would have you understand me on this, perhaps the last time, that we may meet.|$|R
6000|$|Walter {{squeezed}} his hands fast together. [...] "And how--how can you? Don't <b>think</b> <b>me</b> cowardly, Edmund, for that I will never be; never--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For you, of course--to entreat me to {{give you}} up. She <b>thinks</b> <b>me</b> awfully designing--that I've taken some sort of {{possession}} of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>think</b> <b>me</b> changed some {{since that}} morning we drove {{together}} to Holland House--do {{you remember it}} after the night at St. Stephen's?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{opinion of}} me, mejuffrouw, is already {{so low that}} it matters little surely if you <b>think</b> <b>me</b> a common thief as well." ...|$|R
60|$|CAPT. G. I go Home occasionally. And I used to {{know the}} Galleries. (Nervously.) You mustn't <b>think</b> <b>me</b> only a Philistine with--a moustache.|$|R
60|$|Don. Clara. Well, you may <b>think</b> <b>me</b> cruel, but I swear, if he {{were here}} this instant, I believe I should forgive him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur," [...] {{she said}} timidly, [...] "do not <b>think</b> <b>me</b> very presumptuous. I--I {{would wish to}} have five minutes' talk with you--may I?" ...|$|R
