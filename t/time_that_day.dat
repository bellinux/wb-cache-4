5|$|After the Aaron Echolls trial, he is {{interviewed by}} press and cheering fans. Veronica tells Keith (Enrico Colantoni) that the Manning father has offered $20,000 for {{the capture of}} Woody. Veronica talks to Wallace (Percy Daggs III) about Jackie (Tessa Thompson) leaving. Keith visits Vinnie (Ken Marino) in prison, and they agree to track Woody down together. Veronica and Keith learn that Woody was treated for chlamydia. In a dream, Veronica shares a happy family breakfast before her graduation, meeting Wallace for the first <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> before meeting Lilly (Amanda Seyfried). Veronica makes a fake call as Gia to Woody's lawyer, and he reveals that Woody was living at the Quail Creek Lodge under the name Mr. Underhill. At Veronica's graduation, Keith says that he's going to chase Woody, and Mac (Tina Majorino) tells Veronica that {{she is going to}} a hotel with Beaver that night. Just before he can graduate, Weevil (Francis Capra) is arrested for the murder of Thumper (James Molina). Veronica {{graduates}} and says goodbye to Principal Clemmons (Duane Daniels).|$|E
25|$|The Austrians {{declined}} to launch any more serious assaults on Taponier's division and by 1:00 PM the contest degenerated into an artillery duel. Part of Lambert's brigade was rallied and reoccupied Heidenheim. The Austrians threatening the French right flank began withdrawing to Dillingen an der Donau. For the fourth <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> Moreau {{came to see}} Saint-Cyr, this time accompanied by Desaix. They informed their colleague that Delmas' division was not available yet {{and it was too}} late to attack the Austrian right that day. Everything would be ready the next day. Charles hoped that Moreau might concede defeat, but the morning of 12 August found the French army still in position. Charles then gave the order to fall back. Worried about the artillery ammunition shortage, Moreau did not attack Charles' right, but neither did he panic and retreat. Instead he held his position all day on the 12th waiting for confirmation that the Austrians were withdrawing across the Danube.|$|E
50|$|The retreat-and-rise cycle was {{repeated}} several <b>times</b> <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> a full cycle taking between 30 and 45 minutes between each peak.|$|R

500|$|Twitter {{was created}} in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams and {{launched}} in July of that year. The service rapidly gained worldwide popularity. In 2012, more than 100 million users posted 340 million tweets a day, and the service handled an average of 1.6 billion search queries per day. In 2013, {{it was one of}} the ten most-visited websites and has been described as [...] "the SMS of the Internet". As of 2016, Twitter had more than 319 million monthly active users. On the day of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Twitter proved to be the largest source of breaking news, with 40 million election-related tweets sent by 10 p.m. (Eastern <b>Time)</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{their first}} game after the All-Star Break in 1970, the Pirates opened the stadium against Cincinnati on Thursday, July 16. The team donned new uniform {{designs for the}} first <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> a similar plan was for new [...] "mini-skirts" [...] for female ushers however the ushers union {{declined}} the uniform change for female workers. [...] A parade was held before opening ceremonies. [...] The expansive parking lot, both Pirates and Steelers team offices, the Allegheny Club (VIP Club) and the press boxes and facilities were not opened until weeks later due to extended labor union work stoppages. [...] Instead of allowing cars to park, the team instructed fans to park downtown and walk to the stadium over bridges or take shuttle buses. [...] The opening of Three Rivers {{marked the first time}} the Pirates allowed beer to be sold in the stands during a game since the early 1960s.|$|E
500|$|On October 2, 1938, Feller was the {{starting}} pitcher against the Detroit Tigers. Detroit's Hank Greenberg was {{two home runs}} short of Babe Ruth's then-single-season record of 60 home runs. By the ninth inning, Feller had recorded 16 strikeouts, one fewer than the MLB record in a nine-inning game. He tied the record when he struck out Detroit's Pete Fox and passed it, to set a modern major league record of 18 strikeouts, when he struck out Chet Laabs for the fifth <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> Greenberg said, [...] "Feller's curve was jumping wickedly and with that and his fast ball, he was murder." [...] Feller did not earn a win, however, as the Indians lost, 4–1. [...] "It {{was one of those}} days when everything feels perfect, your arm, your coordination, your concentration, everything. There was drama in the air because of Greenberg's attempt to break Ruth's record, and the excitement grew even greater when my strikeouts started to add up", Feller said. For the 1938 season, Feller led all pitchers with 208 walks and 240 strikeouts. In 1939, Feller received his first career Opening Day start against the Tigers after a match against the Browns was rained out. He won the game 5–1, after allowing three hits. On Mother's Day, Feller pitched against the Chicago White Sox with his family in attendance. One pitch was fouled off by Marv Owen into the seats and into the face of Feller's mother; he {{went on to win the}} game. Feller finished the 1939 season having led the AL in wins (24), complete games (24) and innings pitched (296.2) and led the majors for a second consecutive year in both walks (142) and strikeouts (246).|$|E
60|$|Yet he marvelled several <b>times</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> the hilarity {{he should}} have awakened in Sir Terence {{continued}} to cling to the adjutant, and that despite the many vexatious matters claiming attention he should preserve an irrepressible and almost boyish gaiety.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ou des sauvages," [...] {{returned}} the governess, who, {{in spite of}} her ordinary intelligence and great good sense, had several <b>times</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> cast uneasy and stolen glances into the bits of dark wood they had occasionally passed.|$|R
60|$|Colonel Hathaway {{communicated with}} the police office several <b>times</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> and found the {{officials}} courteous but calm--prolific of assurances, but not especially concerned. This was but {{one of a number}} of peculiar cases that daily claimed their attention.|$|R
2500|$|In January 1943, the 9th was re-equipped {{with the}} Bell P-39 Airacobras [...] and Litvyak and Budanova {{were moved to}} the 296 IAP (later the 73 GvIAP, Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment) of Nikolai Baranov, of the 8th Air Army, {{so that they could}} still fly the Yaks. On February 23, she was awarded the Order of the Red Star, made a junior {{lieutenant}} and selected {{to take part in the}} elite air tactic called okhotniki, or [...] "free hunter", where pairs of experienced pilots searched for targets on their own initiative. Twice, she was forced to land due to battle damage. On 22 March she was wounded for the first <b>time.</b> <b>That</b> <b>day</b> she was flying as part of a group of six Yak fighters when they attacked a dozen Ju 88s. Litvyak shot down one of the bombers, but was in turn attacked and wounded by the escorting Bf 109s. She managed to shoot down a Messerschmitt and to return to her airfield and land her plane, but was in severe pain and losing blood.|$|E
2500|$|On May 20, 2010, Dish Network {{announced}} that it was dropping The Weather Channel at 12:00a.m. Eastern <b>Time</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> in favor of its own similar weather information channel, The Weather Cast. The carriage dispute was over the rates that The Weather Channel asked Dish Network to pay: from 11¢ per subscriber per month to 12¢, a 9% increase, totaling $140,000 per month. The dispute was also over The Weather Channel's programming format shifting from an information-based channel to an entertainment-based service. The Weather Channel said in a statement, [...] "Dish has chosen to be the first distributor to drop The Weather Channel rather than pay the standard industry rates others in the industry have already agreed to pay", and encouraged Dish Network customers to switch to other pay television providers. Dave Shull, senior vice president for programming for Dish Network said The Weather Channel's fees were harder for the satellite provider to justify paying as more people receive weather information through the internet and mobile services: [...] "They're looking for bid increases when I feel like there's a real migration to the Web, and it's difficult to really justify those rate increases at this time." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 30 June 1882, {{the day of}} the {{execution}} of Guiteau for the assassination of President James Garfield, Guiteau announced, after famously dancing his way to the gallows, that he would read a poem that he had written. Guiteau said that he had written the poem, which was entitled [...] "I am Going to the Lordy", at about 10:00a.m. Eastern Standard <b>Time</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> After [...] "stubbing his toe {{on the way to the}} gallows", as he put it to {{the execution}}er, Guiteau read [...] and announced that he would now read a prayer of his own composition. After paraphrasing , Guiteau proceeded to read the poem from a piece of paper in a style described as both [...] "sad and doleful" [...] as well as [...] "high pitched" [...] and [...] "childlike". Guiteau had requested an orchestra to play behind him as he recited his poem, but his request was denied. After completing the first verse in song, Guiteau stopped singing and chanted the rest. Multiple times during the reading, Guiteau's voice would fail and he would begin sobbing, even stopping to lay his head on the shoulder of a man standing by him. Right before the completion of the poem, Guiteau raised his voice even higher into falsetto to deliver the final two lines. As the executioner fitted the hood over Guiteau's head and put the rope around his neck, he held onto the piece of paper on which he had written his poem. As per request with the executioner, Guiteau signaled that he was ready to die by dropping the paper.|$|E

60|$|The {{innocent}} words {{which he}} should not have heard were like a blow. What she would never have acknowledged in her waking hours had been revealed in her dreams.

60|$|He thrust {{them into}} her hand and ran quickly down the street, as though he feared that the keen air might make him change his mind in spite of himself.

60|$|Moreover, {{bad as the}} choya was for man, it was {{infinitely}} {{worse for}} beast. A jagged stab from this poisoned cactus {{was the only thing}} Blanco Sol could not stand.

But after Mercedes had been put upon Sol Gale made sure no choya touched him.|$|R
