500|$|With {{but a few}} notable exceptions, the {{interiors}} of the palazzi were from the start less elaborate than those of Sicily's Baroque churches. Many were finished without ornate interior decoration, simply because they {{took so long to}} build {{and by the time they}} were completed Baroque had passed from fashion; the principal rooms were therefore decorated in the new neoclassical style known as [...] "Pompeian". Often one can find a fusion of the two styles, as in the ballroom wing of the Palazzo Aiutamicristo in Palermo, built by Andrea Giganti in 1763, where the ballroom ceiling was frescoed by Giuseppe Cristadoro with allegorical scenes framed by Baroque gilded motifs in plaster. This ceiling was already old-fashioned when it was finished, and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> was decorated in a far simpler mode. Changing use over the past 250 years has simplified palazzo decor further, as the ground floors are now usually shops, banks, or restaurants, and the upper floors divided into apartments, their interiors lost.|$|E
