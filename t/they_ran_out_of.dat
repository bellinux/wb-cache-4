5|$|After {{being forced}} to leave the video arcade when <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> money, Bart and Milhouse find $20 that Homer lost and order a Super Squishee made entirely out of syrup from Apu at the Kwik-E-Mart. With their senses reeling from the high sugar content of the drink, they {{spend the rest of}} the money having a surreal night out in Springfield. The next morning, Bart wakes up with a {{hangover}} and realizes that in the revelry of the night before he joined the Junior Campers, a Boy Scout-style organization that is not affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} days of July, the 24th Infantry {{generally}} tried to hold positions during the day, and then withdrew at night. Their performance was mixed; during the first few North Korean attacks, most units held positions until <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ammunition. Higher officers attempted to move the units back in position but were unsuccessful in the face of mounting North Korean resistance. Notably, L Company fought until surrounded by North Korean attackers; the rest of the regiment was able to drive them off.|$|E
5|$|Gasketball is an action, sports {{video game}} for the iPad by Mikengreg, an {{independent}} development team of Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. Players flick basketballs through 2D physics puzzles into the hoop in single-player, local multiplayer, and asynchronous HORSE-style online multiplayer modes. The game is free-to-play with in-app purchases. Development began in mid 2011 following Mikengreg's successful Solipskier. They were able to live from the earnings for Gasketball two year development at their previous salary, which afforded them the stability to try new avenues and reject prototypes, though they worked 100-hour weeks. Towards {{the end of their}} development, <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> money and lived on the couches of friends. It was released on August 9, 2012, and the game did not reach their desired conversion rate at the time of launch.|$|E

5|$|The Norman castle's defences {{were put}} to the test {{for the first time in}} the Rebellion of 1088, when Norman barons allied with Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy rebelled against the new king William Rufus. The barons, who were also {{supported}} by William the Conqueror's half-brothers Robert of Mortain and Bishop Odo of Bayeux, defended Pevensey Castle against an army led personally by William Rufus. Although the castle's defences were strong enough to resist assaults from land and sea, its defenders were forced to surrender when <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> food after six weeks. Robert was allowed to keep the castle but his son William, Count of Mortain was stripped of it, along with his other English estates, after rebelling against Henry I in the early 12th century.|$|E
5|$|After the {{engagement}} at Le Cornet Malo, C Company and HQ Company of the 2nd Royal Norfolks had fallen {{back to their}} headquarters at Cornet Farm, just outside Le Paradis. The company commanders had been informed by radio that their units were isolated and would receive no assistance. They therefore dug in around the farmhouse, which lay on the Rue du Paradis, {{the boundary between the}} Royal Norfolk Regiment and the adjacent 1st Royal Scots. The Norfolks' last contact with Brigade Headquarters at L'Epinette was at 11:30 but despite no support and heavy opposition, the defenders held out against the 14th Company, 1st Battalion of the 2nd SS Infantry Regiment until 17:15, when <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ammunition. During the battle the Germans attacked the farmhouse with mortars, tanks and artillery shelling, which destroyed the building and forced the defenders to relocate to a cowshed. SS-Standartenführer Hans Friedemann Götze, commander of the Totenkopf Division's third regiment, was killed in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|Gasketball was {{developed}} and produced by Mikengreg, an Iowa-based two-man team: Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. After releasing their first game, the sport-inspired Solipskier for iPhone and iPad, Boxleiter and Wohlwend lived off the profits for two years while working on Gasketball, paying themselves their same salaries from their Adobe Flash development days but having the security to try new ideas. Wohlwend made somewhat more income due to other collaborations, such as Puzzlejuice with Asher Vollmer, but shared his income with Boxleiter. Development began in mid 2011. Even though Solipskier was successful, the duo {{did not have a}} following comparable to indie developers like Team Meat and thus did not feel pressured to meet high expectations. Instead, their pressure was internal. Wohlwend said he worked 100-hour weeks with no weekends or vacations while living on the Solipskier funds. When <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> money, Boxleiter borrowed money from his parents, and eventually they both went homeless, living on the couches of friends.|$|E

5|$|The 4th and 55th Fighter Regiments {{had most}} of the MiG-3s {{assigned}} to the Odessa Military District and their experiences {{on the first day}} of the war may be taken as typical. The 4th, an experienced unit, shot down a Romanian Bristol Blenheim reconnaissance bomber, confirmed by postwar research, and lost one aircraft which crashed into an obstacle on takeoff. The 55th was much less experienced with the MiG-3 and claimed three aircraft shot down, although recent research confirms only one German Henschel Hs 126 was 40% damaged, and suffered three pilots killed and nine aircraft lost. The most unusual case was the pair of MiG-3s dispatched from the 55th on a reconnaissance mission to Ploieşti that failed to properly calculate their fuel consumption and both were forced to land when <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fuel.|$|E
25|$|Losses were {{light on}} both sides despite the {{intensity}} of the fight. Several of the Union ships were hit, but none suffered severe damage. This was true for the Confederates also, aside from Curlew, but the remaining Mosquito Fleet had to retire simply because <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ammunition.|$|E

Warrego was briefly recommissioned from 17 January to 23 August 1920 for the visit of the Prince of Wales to Australia, then recommissioned again on 27 March 1928 for training purposes.|$|E

25|$|Hereford {{originally}} {{played in}} an all-white strip, but their traditional colours are white shirts and black shorts. This {{dates back to}} the end of the Second World War when they used material from blackout curtains to make shorts when <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> white material. However, they occasionally reverted to an all-white strip, latterly in the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons. Their away colours varied over the years, with predominantly yellow colours being used in later years.|$|E
25|$|Curtis {{concentrated}} {{his army}} around the Confederate positions near Elkhorn Tavern during the night; at dawn he started an artillery bombardment which lasted two hours. Due to having no ammunition reserves nearby, the Confederates soon ran very low on artillery shells and couldn't resupply {{for at least}} five or six hours. Van Dorn ordered his army to retreat towards the east before moving southwards. Neither Van Dorn nor Price remained behind to supervise the retreat, so the units left the field chaotically, with the artillery batteries leaving as <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ammunition and the infantry and cavalry regiments following.|$|E

In the final, the Czech Republic collapsed to 61 all out against a much improved Russia team from their last encounter in the Euro Twenty 20 tournament and Russia knocked off the required runs within 11 overs, leaving the Czech team runners up in an international final once again.|$|E

25|$|From {{the police}} force's {{beginnings}} in 1840 {{through the next}} forty years, policing arrangements varied around New Zealand. Whilst the nationally organised Armed Constabulary split its efforts between regular law enforcement functions and militia support to the land wars, some provinces desired local police forces of their own. This led to a separate Provincial Police Force Act being passed by the Parliament. However, provincial policing models lasted only two decades as economic depression in the 1870s saw some provinces stop paying their police as <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> money. Eventually, the government decided a single nationally organised police {{would be the best}} and most efficient policing arrangement.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Kämärä was a 1918 Finnish Civil War battle fought at the Kämärä (now Gavrilovo, Leningrad oblast, Russia) {{railway station}} on 27 January 1918 between the Whites and the Reds. The battle {{began as a}} White Guard {{battalion}} from Vyborg attacked Kämärä on its march to the White controlled side of the Karelian Isthmus. After taking the village, the Whites ambushed a Red train carrying a large cargo of weapons from Saint Petersburg, but were finally forced to leave the scene as <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ammunition. The Battle of Kämärä {{is considered to be}} the first battle of the Civil War, although some minor incidents had occurred throughout January.|$|E
25|$|Durant and {{his crew}} of three, Bill Cleveland, Ray Frank, and Tommy Field, were badly injured in the crash. Durant {{suffered}} a broken femur and a badly injured back. Two Delta Force snipers, MSG Gary Gordon and SFC Randy Shughart, had been providing suppressive fire from the air at hostile Somalis who were converging on the crash site. Both volunteered for insertion onto the ground to protect the crew and join Durant in fighting off the advancing Somalis. The pair killed an estimated 25 Somalis before <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ammunition. They were soon overwhelmed and killed, after Cleveland, Frank and Field had died. Both Gordon and Shughart received the Medal of Honor posthumously for their heroism in this action.|$|E

25|$|In early 2012, Turkish {{clothing}} company Mavi Jeans, {{contracted with}} Lima {{to be the}} face and spokesmodel for the brand. In {{the first quarter of}} 2012, her advertisement campaign increased sales by 50%. It also provided a 20% increase in stores and online traffic. Furthermore, her television commercial, which was watched by 28 million people, became a trending topic at Twitter and the number of people on Mavi's Facebook page increased by 20%. Store officials at Mavi say the clothing Lima wore in the ad campaigns was met with so much demand that <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> stock. Due to her success rate with the company, the European and Russian branch of Mavi decided to make her the global face of the brand.|$|E
25|$|At Krinkelt, T/5 Sgt Vernon McGarity {{was wounded}} {{by the early}} morning {{artillery}} barrage. After he was treated, he refused to be evacuated {{and returned to his}} squad. He and his squad repulsed four German tanks and their supporting infantry, and McGarity repeatedly braved direct fire to secure ammunition and rescue wounded soldiers. McGarity and his squad held the German forces back for a full day and were only captured on the morning of 17 December when <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ammunition. The German forces also drew a rapid response from U.S. artillery, who had registered the forward positions of their infantry. The artillery rained fire on the exposed advancing Germans while the U.S. troops remained in their covered foxholes.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only did}} the weather {{frustrate}} efforts to reach the scene, but also it hampered the ability to fight the fire. Attempts to disconnect hoses to move them resulted in the water freezing and bursting the hoses; Since the street drains were blocked with snow, runoff water from the fire rose to the running boards on the fire department's pumpers. When this water froze, it required jackhammers to extricate the pumpers. Hoses also {{had to be removed}} with jackhammers. Some fire truck pumpers stalled in the snow when wind blew into the engines or <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fuel. Since their design necessitated the use of water instead of antifreeze as a coolant, the water in the pumper froze and ruined them.|$|E
