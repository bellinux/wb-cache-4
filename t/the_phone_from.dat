During flashbacks, a seventeen-year-old Lily Rhodes (Brittany Snow), having deliberately gotten expelled from The Thacher School in Ojai, California travels to Malibu, California to meet with her father, Rick Rhodes (Andrew McCarthy), the wealthy owner of Rhodes Records.

When the antagonism escalates to a fight at the party, security arrests Owen and Lily although Carol and Shep manage to escape. From jail, Lily calls CeCe. CeCe calls her daughters irresponsible. Carol, who has come to pay Lily’s bail, overhears Lily defend Carol's lifestyle.

500|$|Meanwhile, {{in their}} room, Greenfield and fellow speechwriter Adam Walinsky {{worked on a}} formal {{response}} to the King assassination with assistance over <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>from</b> Ted Sorenson in New York City. (The original address prepared for the Cleveland City Club, a campaign piece on the economy meant to win the support of local business owners and Democratic Party officials, was dispensed with.) Sorenson's memory differed in that he recalled receiving a call from Kennedy {{at his home in}} Washington D.C, rather than New York, on the night of April 4. Kennedy asked for Sorenson's thoughts on a speech being prepared for his appearance in Cleveland and said he would call back within the hour. Sorenson, mindful of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, quickly began writing notes on scrap pieces of paper. When Kennedy called back, Sorenson dictated what he had produced and the senator transcribed it. Mankiewicz later recalled being [...] "occasionally" [...] involved in the drafting process.|$|E
500|$|It's {{closing time}} at the Krusty Krab, and Squidward answers a last-minute call from a customer. Just as {{he is about to}} tell them that the {{restaurant}} is closed, Mr. Krabs suddenly appears and snatches <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>from</b> Squidward's hands. The customer wants to order a pizza and have it delivered, an order Mr. Krabs happily accepts knowing he could get extra money. Squidward protests this by saying the restaurant doesn't serve pizza nor do they do deliveries, but Mr. Krabs spontaneously makes a pizza out of Krabby Patties and forces Squidward and SpongeBob to deliver it. After SpongeBob does a few [...] "safety checks" [...] of the delivery boat, Squidward forces him to drive. However, SpongeBob cannot drive as he is still in boating school, but Squidward insists saying [...] "it's just around the corner". SpongeBob tries to shift into reverse, but panics and ends up [...] "backing up" [...] for miles and miles until the boat runs out of gas {{in the middle of a}} desert. Squidward complains about this, and eventually kicks the boat out of frustration after SpongeBob mentions that the pizza is getting cold. This causes the boat to suddenly drive back to the Krusty Krab, leaving the two stranded and to continue their delivery on foot.|$|E

500|$|There {{were only}} 16 presidential primary states in 1920, {{of which the}} most crucial to Harding was Ohio. Harding had to have some loyalists at the {{convention}} to have any chance of nomination, and the Wood campaign hoped to knock Harding {{out of the race}} by taking Ohio. Wood campaigned in the state, and his supporter, Procter, spent large sums; Harding spoke in the nonconfrontational style he had adopted in 1914. Harding and Daugherty were so confident of sweeping Ohio's 48 delegates that the candidate went on to the next state, Indiana, before the April 27 Ohio primary. Harding carried Ohio by only 15,000 votes over Wood, taking less than half the total vote, and won only 39 of 48 delegates. In Indiana, Harding finished fourth, with less than ten percent of the vote, and failed to win a single delegate. He was willing to give up and have Daugherty file his nomination papers for the Senate, but Florence Harding grabbed <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>from</b> his hand, [...] "Warren Harding, what are you doing? Give up? Not until the convention is over. Think of your friends in Ohio!"

If the rewrite doesn't work, we can use the song on a future Whitney project, maybe her greatest hits album." [...] Rich and Friedman ultimately rewrote the entire lyric except for the title. They then redemoed the song and sent the new version to Davis. Davis, Jackson and everyone involved loved the new version of [...] "Run to You", so the song was finally set for the movie.|$|E

H.R. provided the vocals for [...] "Sacred Love" [...] over <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>from</b> the Lorton Reformatory while doing a bid for a cannabis charge. Also critically praised was H.R.'s performance: Rick Anderson wrote on AllMusic that, [...] " [...] digs deep into his bag of voices and pulls them all out, one by one: the frightening nasal falsetto that was his signature in the band's hardcore days, an almost bel canto baritone, and a declamatory speed-rap chatter that spews lyrics with the mechanical precision of a machine gun". The title track's video was shown on MTV's then-new 120 Minutes program, for which the band appeared in promotional footage.|$|E
