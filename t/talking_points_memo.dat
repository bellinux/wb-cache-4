25|$|In October 2009, Democratic {{political}} operatives used YouTube {{videos of}} WWE for political ads. On October 16, Colleen Flanagan, {{a spokeswoman for}} Chris Dodd, posted controversial videos that showed the unsavory side of WWE on <b>Talking</b> <b>Points</b> <b>Memo,</b> a political news website. She said the programming showed “simulated rape, public sex and necrophilia” and McMahon should not be Senator because she “condones this type of behavior”. Hours later, YouTube removed the videos after contact from WWE. WWE had informed YouTube that the material was copyright under US law.|$|E
25|$|An early {{milestone}} {{in the rise}} in importance of blogs came in 2002, when many bloggers focused on comments by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. Senator Lott, at a party honoring U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States {{would have been better}} off had Thurmond been elected president. Lott's critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of racial segregation, a policy advocated by Thurmond's 1948 presidential campaign. This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers. (See Josh Marshall's <b>Talking</b> <b>Points</b> <b>Memo.)</b> Though Lott's comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story. Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader.|$|E

40|$|Creative {{metaphor is}} a {{phenomenon}} that stretches and bends the conventions of semantic description, often to humorous and poetic extremes. The computational modeling of metaphor thus requires a knowledge representation that is just as stretchable and semantically accommodating. We present here a flexible knowledge representation for metaphor interpretation and generation, called <b>Talking</b> <b>Points,</b> and describe how <b>talking</b> <b>points</b> can be acquired {{on a large scale}} from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and from the web. We show how <b>talking</b> <b>points</b> can be fluidly connected to form a slipnet, and demonstrate that <b>talking</b> <b>points</b> provide an especially concise representation for concepts in general. ...|$|R

500|$|On May 27, {{the website}} <b>Talking</b> <b>Points</b> <b>Memo</b> posted a {{handwritten}} letter by Sestak to candidates declaring his intent {{to run for}} Senate. Sestak did not dispute {{the authenticity of the}} letter, but told the press he wanted to discuss the matter with his family before making a formal decision. Sestak told media outlets he realized President Obama wished him not to run against Specter, but that he felt the choice should be with the voters of Pennsylvania rather than the president. Governor Rendell overtly tried to convince him not to run, believing it would damage Sestak's own political future, plus cost the Democratic Party both Sestak's House seat and possibly damage Specter's general election chances. Nevertheless, Sestak formally declared his candidacy for the Democratic nomination on August 4, 2009, in a speech before a Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in his native Delaware County. Shortly after the announcement, Toomey issued a statement welcoming Sestak to the race, describing him as [...] "a consistent liberal who really believes in his values", as compared to Specter, who he called [...] "a career political opportunist who believes in nothing but his own re-election".|$|E

Drudge reported the story without a link but as [...] "developing", titling the headline [...] "Shock: McCain Volunteer Attacked and Mutilated in Pittsburgh – [...] "B" [...] carved into 20 yr old Woman's Face". The story set off a [...] "storm of media attention", being quickly picked up by many conservative bloggers and right-wing talk radio show hosts, all citing the Drudge Report as their source. It was also reported in newspapers and TV both in the US and around the world. The story was confirmed to be a hoax perpetrated by Todd and, according to <b>Talking</b> <b>Points</b> <b>Memo,</b> spread to reporters by McCain's Pennsylvania Communications Director.|$|E
2500|$|During George W. Bush's first term, {{the blog}} {{frequently}} discussed {{foreign policy and}} was especially critical of administration policy towards Iraq and North Korea. After the 2004 election, posts {{began to focus on}} the Bush administration's proposal to privatize Social Security. In addition to criticizing the substance of the proposals, Marshall argued that a unified front in the Democratic Party would deny Republicans political cover and force a loss for them on Social Security. <b>Talking</b> <b>Points</b> <b>Memo</b> closely tracked the positions of members of Congress on the issue throughout 2005. It asked readers to monitor local media for comments from their own members of congress, and public categories were created for politicians on this issue: wavering Democrats were the [...] "Faint-hearted Faction" [...] and Republicans who doubted the President's plan were the [...] "Conscience Caucus". [...] Marshall also coined the term [...] "Bamboozlepalooza", in reference to President Bush's 60-day (it was extended) tour promoting social security privatization. Other terms that Marshall has coined while criticizing the Bush administration include [...] "Up-is-downism" [...] and [...] "Mumbojumbocrats".|$|E

He {{was joined by}} John Mayer, Alan Jackson, Phil Vassar, and Dave Matthews Band. When announced that Nas was to perform, political commentator Bill O'Reilly and Fox News denounced the concert and called for Nas's removal, citing [...] "violent" [...] lyrics on songs such as [...] "Shoot 'Em Up", [...] "Got Urself a Gun", and [...] "Made You Look". During his <b>Talking</b> <b>Points</b> <b>Memo</b> segment for August 15, 2007, an argument erupted in which O'Reilly claimed {{that it was not}} only Nas's lyrical content that made him inappropriate for the event, citing the gun conviction on Nas's criminal record. In the midst of his debate with author Bakari Kitwana (The Hip Hop Generation), who defended Nas, claiming that Fox News had [...] "cherry picked" [...] select fragments of the songs to make their case, O'Reilly shouted, [...] "Even in his personal life, man, he's got a conviction for weapons, all right? He's got a weapons conviction, sir! On his sheet! This is a school that had a mass murderer with a shotgun gunning down people—this guy has got a conviction for weapons, and you say he's appropriate? Come on!" [...] O'Reilly repeated the claim another five times before cutting the segment short.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{effective}} speaker can use metaphor {{to communicate}} {{a wealth of}} propositions and affective attitudes with a single juxtaposition of ideas [12, 8, 6, 10, 7, 3, 15]. But as such, an effective metaphor requires effective communication, which in turn requires that the speaker has {{a clear idea of}} the content to be communicated, and an equally clear understanding of which conceptual vehicles best communicate this content. We present here a concise corpusderived meaning representation for metaphor processing that captures the most widely-used <b>talking</b> <b>points</b> that are evoked in everyday metaphors and similes. We illustrate how these <b>talking</b> <b>points</b> can be acquired by harvesting the web, and further show how comparable but discretely different <b>talking</b> <b>points</b> can be reconciled during metaphor processing. Finally, by replicating the clustering experiments of [1], we show that <b>talking</b> <b>points</b> yield an especially concise representation of concepts in general. ...|$|R
