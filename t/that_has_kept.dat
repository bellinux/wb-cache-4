5|$|Manchester United's {{starting}} right-winger {{from the}} 2008 final, Owen Hargreaves, missed the match {{as he was}} still in rehabilitation after a double knee operation to cure his tendinitis problems that had seen him play little part in the 2008–09 Champions League campaign. It had been expected that defender Wes Brown would also miss the match after suffering a recurrence of a foot injury, but he returned to training quicker than expected and was involved in United's match against Hull City on 24 May, although he picked up a slight knock during the game. Rio Ferdinand was also a doubt following a calf injury <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>kept</b> him out of the United side since the semi-final second leg against Arsenal; Alex Ferguson had said that Ferdinand might not start in Rome if he was not fit to play against Hull, but he later admitted that Ferdinand was on course to recover in time to play in the match. Second-choice goalkeeper Ben Foster also missed the match after requiring surgery to repair a ruptured ligament in his right thumb in May 2009. On the other hand, following John O'Shea's winning goal in Manchester United's semi-final first leg victory over Arsenal, United manager Alex Ferguson suggested that the Irish utility player would be guaranteed a place in the starting line-up were United to reach the final. O'Shea's place in the team was confirmed at Manchester United's media day the week before the final. South Korean midfielder Park Ji-sung was also promised a place in the team after he missed the 2008 final, finally making him the first Asian to appear in a European Cup final. Cristiano Ronaldo suffered a slight injury scare in training the night before the final, requiring a bandage on his lower right leg, but he was eventually fit enough to play in the match.|$|E
25|$|WHO has the {{broadest}} health mandate under the UN system, including setting priorities, coordinating global health surveillance, and emergency {{assistance in the}} event of disease outbreaks. Health experts give WHO credit for major successes, such as the eradication of smallpox, near eradication of polio, and substantial progress in controlling childhood diseases, and in expanding primary health care in developing countries. WHO defenders blame continued member state parsimony <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>kept</b> WHO's regular biennial budget to roughly $850 million for several years and forced it to rely more on voluntary contributions that often come with strings attached as the cause of its shortcomings. This situation led to lack of focus at the top level as well as overly optimistic forecasts.|$|E

[...] The six sides of the [...] "prison" [...] are said to be: patriarchal attitudes, egocentricity, scientific single vision, the bureaucratic mentality, nationalism (xenophobia), and the [...] "big city outlook" [...] (fear of nature). [...] Since consciousness, according to Satin, ultimately determines our institutions, prison consciousness is said to be ultimately responsible for [...] "monolithic" [...] institutions that offer us {{little in the way of}} freedom of choice or connection with others. [...] Some representative monolithic institutions are: bureaucratic government, automobile-centered transportation systems, attorney-centered law, doctor-centered health care, and church-centered spirituality.|$|E

The {{only thing that can}} open it is a key which is sought by the Minion, a demonic spirit that transfers itself into the nearby host body when his previous one is killed off. Awakening in New York City, the Minion tracks down Karen Goodleaf as Lukas arrives to America to protect her and the key. Michael Haag in his book Templars: History and Myth: From Solomon's Temple to the Freemasons (2009) said, [...] "The budget for this film was $12million. A pity they did not spend a cent on research (citing that one reference was 600 years out) ...

[...] Chris Dafoe, in his review for The Globe and Mail, wrote, [...] "At its best, The Abyss offers a harrowing, thrilling journey through inky waters and high tension.

2500|$|The Saarloos wolfdog traces {{its origins}} {{to the efforts}} of a Dutch breeder in 1935. Leendert Saarloos who {{crossbred}} a German Shepherd male to a female Mackenzie Valley wolf (Canis lupus occidentalis). He aimed for an improved version of the German Shepherd that would be immune to [...] canine distemper. He succeeded insofar as the Saarloos Wolfdog known today is a strong, imposing breed <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>kept</b> its wolf-like characteristics; it is cautious, reserved, and lacks the ferocity to attack. [...] It is not, however, the dog that Leendert Saarloos hoped to get, as nearly all the first-generation hybrids succumbed to distemper. Until Leendert Saarloos died in 1969, he was in full control over the breeding of his [...] "European wolfdog". The Dutch Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1975. To honor its creator they changed the name to [...] "Saarloos Wolfdog". In 1981 the breed was recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI). Some Saarloos Wolfdogs have been trained as guide dogs for the blind and as rescue dogs.|$|E
2500|$|Zelaya supporters, {{largely from}} labour unions and the poor, claim {{conservative}} business leaders are actually concerned because Zelaya had sharply increased the minimum wage. Víctor Meza, formerly Zelaya's interior minister, stated that: [...] "The impression that {{stuck with the}} traditional political class and with the most conservative business leaders {{of the country was}} that Zelaya had taken a dangerous turn to the left, and therefore that their interests were in jeopardy." [...] "We underestimated the conservatism of the Honduran political class and the military leadership." [...] According to John Donaghy, of Caritas, the real conflict in Honduras is between the poor and wealthy: [...] "It's a system <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>kept</b> the poor down for years." [...] To some members of Honduras's small upper class, Zelaya was ousted because of his blossoming leftist alliance with President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela which they recognised as a threat to their interests. To the working-class, it appears Zelaya was ousted because the elite felt threatened by his efforts to improve their lives – most notably with a 60% {{increase in the minimum wage}} to about US$9.60 a day from about $6 a day. Some who protested in support of Zelaya had never voted for him.|$|E
