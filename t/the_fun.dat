5|$|From {{the success}} of {{magazines}} in Japan, Nintendo knew that game tips were a valued asset.

5|$|A {{visit by}} Dahlia Brinkley, the only Springfield Elementary {{graduate}} ever to enter an Ivy League college, gives Lisa a severe inferiority complex {{because she is}} involved in very few extracurricular activities. When Ned Flanders resigns as coach of Bart's Little League team, the Springfield Isotots, Lisa seizes the chance to extend her résumé and takes the position. Since she knows nothing about baseball, she seeks advice from the patrons of Moe's Tavern, who direct her to Professor Frink and his scientific colleagues. She learns about sabermetrics from them and uses this science to organize the Isotots' strategy; as a result, their record quickly improves and they rise in the league standings. However, Bart eventually rebels against her management, saying that she has taken all <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> out of the game, and hits a home run despite her orders to let the pitcher walk him. The Isotots win the game, but Lisa throws Bart off the team for his insubordination.|$|E
5|$|Anna is {{the younger}} {{child in the}} royal family of Arendelle, whose older sister, Elsa is born {{with the power to}} create and control ice and snow. As children, they enjoy the life of princesses using Elsa's {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland for their enjoyment. After they create a snowman named Olaf in the throne room, Elsa accidentally strikes Anna unconscious with her magic. The king and queen hurriedly take Anna to the mountain trolls for help. The troll king, Pabbie, erases Anna's memory of her sister's magic, nulling Elsa's power, only leaving memory of <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> the sisters shared. Pabbie warns Elsa to control her powers—a strike to Anna's heart would have been fatal. In an effort to protect Anna, the king and queen lock the castle gates and generally restrict Elsa to her new separate bedroom. Confused by the sudden loss of contact by Elsa, Anna makes repeated failed attempts to draw her out of her room. Elsa cares too much for her sister, traumatized by the near-death experience and she resists reconnecting with Anna. Eventually, the younger sister ceases trying to rekindle their bond. The sisters become even more isolated from each other after their parents, the King and Queen of Arendelle, die in a shipwreck. Devastated by the news, Anna tries to reunite with her sister, looking for love and comfort in the tragedy. Elsa remains in her room, not attending her parents' funeral.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{reported}} that players rarely {{need to use}} Undead Nightmare new weapons. Whitehead (Eurogamer) said that Marston's firearms are mostly indistinguishable apart from the blunderbuss, which is only useful when the player is overrun by zombies. GameSpot added that the game's combat is repetitive and less fun in the expansion, as zombies barely pose a threat. The zombies, without guns, cover, horses, lack the complexities of cowboys and, apart {{from some of the}} special zombie types, are only a threat at short distances. The reviewer found little variation between weapons when firing at close range, which is more effective than aiming at a distance. <b>The</b> <b>fun</b> of the new guns quickly faded for the critic, who found little incentive to use traditional gunfight strategies. Whitehead (Eurogamer) too noted that the base game relied on its use of cover during gunfights, which the expansion jettisons altogether. Thus the player is forced into the technique of backtracking and turning to use the time-slowing Dead Eye mode to clear zombies with headshots. The reviewer also found the controls clumsy and often tripped on piles of zombie bodies or became stuck in doorways. While the idea of zombie animals scared Whitehead, he was both relieved and disappointed to find that bears and cougars, like the humans, died with a single bullet.|$|E
