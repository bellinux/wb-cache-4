5|$|In 2503, Mohandar {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the Hierarchy to discuss Zamara, a missing preserver. There were none on Shakuras. A terran female, Rosemary Dahl, attended the meeting, along with Vartanil (a survivor from Aiur) and Executor Selendis; she was subject to protoss anti-female bias (due to their experiences with Sarah Kerrigan). Among the topics of conversation covered were Ulrezaj, a powerful dark archon and old enemy of the Khalai. During the meeting, Mohandar deferred to <b>the</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> Hierarch Artanis.|$|E
5|$|The ACCC {{was granted}} special {{leave to appeal}} to the High Court against <b>the</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> the full bench of the Federal Court. The appeal was heard on 16 May 2007. The Australian Government Solicitor acted for the ACCC, with Lindsay Foster as Senior Counsel; Blake Dawson and David Yates SC {{represented}} Baxter. In addition to Baxter, the states of Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales were respondents to the appeal. The High Court decided on 29 August 2007, by a 6–1 majority, to allow the ACCC's appeal and remit the matter back to the full bench of Federal Court for reconsideration. The majority held that Baxter was not covered by derivative governmental immunity in its dealings with the state governments.|$|E
40|$|This study extends prior {{cross-cultural}} {{research by}} examining the effects of ethnic culture and organizational culture (Big 4 and non-Big 4 accounting firm affiliations) on <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> accountants in Fiji. The study also examines how interaction between ethnic culture and organizational culture influences <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> accountants. It examines the extent and the cause <b>of</b> differences between <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> Ethnic Fijian and Indo-Fijian accountants when interpreting and applying selected International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). Consistent with their ethnic cultural values, {{the results show that}} Indo-Fijian accountants are generally more conservative in their judgments than their Ethnic Fijian counterparts. This study provides empirical evidence to support the view that both ethnic culture and organizational culture {{have a significant effect on}} the manner in which accountants within a country interpret uncertainty expressions contained in the IFRSs. The results also show that organizational culture has a greater effect on <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> accountants than ethnic culture. The results of this study provide important insights into the factors affecting <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> accountants within a country and raise interesting theoretical issues. 0 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> grammaticality of Japanese and English bitransitive {{sentences}} with a differing {{number of}} arguments. Japanese speakers exposed to Chomsky’s generative grammar (n = 30) and those not exposed (n = 28) were compared. This exposure {{was expected to}} facilitate a sentence− oriented judgment strategy that would direct speakers towards decreasing the grammaticality of the Japanese sentences lacking one or more arguments. Findings showed no effect in <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> Japanese sentences. However, in <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English sentences speakers exposed to generative grammar approximated to those made by native speakers of English. It was suggested that the exposure to generative grammar facilitated the sentence−oriented strategy in <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> English sentences, {{but it was not}} so effective as to weaken a discourse−oriented strategy used by Japanese speakers when they judged Japanese sentences...|$|R

5|$|Though the location, plan of attack, {{and timing}} were {{determined}} by Hitler, he blamed the defeat on his General Staff. Unlike Stalin, who gave his commanding generals the liberty to make important command decisions, Hitler's interference in German military matters progressively increased while {{his attention to the}} political aspects of the war decreased. The opposite was true for Stalin; throughout the Kursk campaign, he trusted <b>the</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> his commanders, and as their decisions led to battlefield success it increased his trust in their military judgment. Stalin stepped back from operational planning, only rarely overruling military decisions, resulting in the Red Army gaining more freedom of action {{during the course of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Wachovia Bank also filed {{a federal}} suit in October 2007 in Atlanta seeking about $940,000 from Vick and Gerald Frank Jenkins, a {{business}} partner.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 303, {{following}} a series of rebellions in Melitene (Malatya, Turkey) and Syria, a second edict was published, ordering the arrest and imprisonment of all bishops and priests.

Following the publication of the second edict, prisons began to fillthe underdeveloped prison system of the time could not handle the deacons, lectors, priests, bishops, and exorcists forced upon it.
