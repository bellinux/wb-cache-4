An artist and watercolorist, Fukuhara would later <b>teach</b> <b>a</b> series of annual artistic {{workshops}} at Manzanar beginning in 1998. His workshops, which usually had about 80 students a year, including Milford Zornes, used outdoor structures at Manzanar to teach water color painting.|$|E

5|$|Rankings tend to {{concentrate}} on representing MBA schools themselves, but some schools offer MBA programs of different qualities and yet the ranking will only rely upon information from the full-time program (e.g., a school may use highly reputable faculty to <b>teach</b> <b>a</b> daytime program, but use adjunct faculty in its evening program or have drastically lower admissions criteria for its evening program than for its daytime program).|$|E
5|$|Dworkin and MacKinnon, however, {{continued}} to discuss civil rights litigation {{as a possible}} approach to combating pornography. In the fall of 1983, MacKinnon secured a one-semester appointment for Dworkin at the University of Minnesota, to <b>teach</b> <b>a</b> course in literature for the Women's Studies program and co-teach (with MacKinnon) an interdepartmental course on pornography, where they hashed out details of a civil rights approach. With encouragement from community activists in south Minneapolis, the Minneapolis city government hired Dworkin and MacKinnon to draft an antipornography civil rights ordinance as {{an amendment to the}} Minneapolis city civil rights ordinance.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from Cornell, Chamberlin {{was hired by}} the University of Utah, where he worked from 1904 to 1908, as an assistant professor (19041905) then full professor. He soon began improving biology courses, which at the time were only of high school grade, to collegiate standards, and introduced new courses in vertebrate histology and embryology. He was the first dean of University of Utah School of Medicine, serving from 1905 to 1907. During the summer of 1906, his plans to <b>teach</b> <b>a</b> summer course in embryology at the University of Chicago were cancelled when he suffered a serious accident in a fall, breaking two leg bones and severing an artery in his leg. In 1907, University officials decided to merge the medical school into an existing department, which made Chamberlin's deanship obsolete. He resigned as dean in May, 1907, although remained a faculty member. The medical students strongly objected, crediting the school's gains {{over the past few years}} largely to his efforts.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Cummings {{was called}} back to USC to develop and <b>teach</b> <b>a</b> {{curriculum}} on civilian aviation for returning veterans. She {{spent much of the}} 1950s as a housewife, raising her children, but remained active as a part-time flight instructor, as well as helping develop curricula for Federal Aviation Administration institutions. She also raced airplanes competitively during this period and won the 1957 Powder Puff Derby, capturing the first prize pot of $800 (approximately $ in present-day terms). In 1962, she joined Harvey Mudd College and, in association with the Bates Foundation, founded the school's Bates Aeronautics Program. She ran the program with her husband until he retired in 1979, and continued alone until the program ended with her 1990 retirement. She continued teaching classes on aeronautics, however, until 1996. Her students include astronauts George Nelson and Stanley G. Love. She also served as an FAA Pilot Examiner for over two decades and was named the organization's Flight Instructor of the Year for the Ontario district in 1972.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, with Babcock's support, Stebbins {{was made}} a full {{professor}} in the Department of Genetics at UC Berkeley, after the Department of Botany failed to promote him. Stebbins was required to <b>teach</b> <b>a</b> course on evolution, and during his preparation he became excited by contemporary research combining genetics and evolution. He became associated with a group known as the Bay Area Biosystematists, which included botanist Jens Clausen, taxonomist David D. Keck, physiologist William Hiesey and the evolutionary geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky. During this time he also became friends with the botanist Herbert Baker. With the encouragement of this group of scientists, Stebbins directed his research towards evolution. He became involved with the Society for the Study of Evolution in 1946, {{and was one of}} the few botanists involved with the new organization.|$|E

5|$|Mohini plays {{a lesser}} {{role in a}} Shaiva legend in the Skanda Purana. Here, Vishnu as Mohini joins Shiva to <b>teach</b> <b>a</b> lesson to arrogant sages. A group of sages are {{performing}} rituals in a forest, and start to consider themselves as gods. To humble them, Shiva {{takes the form of}} an attractive young beggar (Bhikshatana) and Vishnu becomes Mohini, his wife. While the sages fall for Mohini, their women wildly chase Shiva. When they regain their senses, they perform a black magic sacrifice, which produces a serpent, a lion, an elephant (or tiger) and a dwarf, all of which are overpowered by Shiva. Shiva then dances on the dwarf and takes the form of Nataraja, the cosmic dancer. The legend is retold in the Tamil Kovil Puranam and Kandha Puranam with some variation. This legend is also told in the Sthala Purana related to the Chidambaram Temple dedicated to Shiva-Nataraja.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly {{worked in}} the Reformed Protestant {{theological}} tradition, also known as Calvinism. It took the Bible as the authoritative word of God, from which all theological reflection must be based. The divines were committed to the Reformed doctrine of predestination—that God chooses certain men to be saved and enjoy eternal life rather than eternal punishment. There was some disagreement at the Assembly over the doctrine of particular redemption—that Christ died only for those chosen for salvation. The Assembly also held to Reformed covenant theology, a framework for interpreting the Bible. The Assembly's Confession {{is the first of}} the Reformed confessions to <b>teach</b> <b>a</b> doctrine called the covenant of works, which teaches that before the fall of man, God promised eternal life to Adam on condition that he perfectly obeyed God.|$|E
5|$|To {{deal with}} this {{shortage}} of educational opportunities, Scott Weiner et al. suggest that countries with developed emergency medical systems should focus on training the trainers. This, he believes, is a sustainable approach to promote the development of emergency medicine worldwide. It works by sending developed country health care workers to equip {{a small group of}} trainees with the necessary skills to then go on and teach the concepts to others. As such, it may be able to leverage the insights of developed emergency medical systems while remaining sustainable, as the newly trained trainers continue to spread the knowledge. The Tuscan Emergency Medicine Initiative is an example, with physicians from other specialties currently working in emergency departments being taught how to <b>teach</b> <b>a</b> new group of emergency medical specialists.|$|E

5|$|After {{handing over}} the {{earrings}} and taking leave of his guru, Uttanka went to Hastinapur, {{the kingdom of}} King Janamejaya. He resolved to <b>teach</b> <b>a</b> lesson to Takshaka who had caused him trouble. He informed Janamejaya that it was Takshaka who had killed his father Parikshit and advised Janamejaya to perform a snake sacrifice to exterminate the serpents. Uttanka {{was one of the}} rishis who participated in the Sarpa Satra yagna initiated by the king. Sarpa Satra was meant to draw all serpents to the sacrificial fire to certain death by the chanting of mantras. After the serpents started falling into the sacrificial fire, Takshaka was not to be found anywhere. Uttanka then recited the mantras with great vigour to draw Takshaka to the fire. In mortal fear, Taskshaka took shelter with Indra and got himself tied to the throne of Indra for protection. Uttanka, who realised that Takshaka had taken refuge with Indra, intensified his mantras to ensure that not only Takshaka but also Indra along with his throne were drawn to the fire. Indra freed the snake from the throne and escaped. However, when Takshaka was about to drop to death into the sacrificial fire, Astika, a young boy well versed in scriptures, son of the sage Jaratkaru intervened with Janamejaya. Astika ensured that the Sarpa Satra was stopped and the life of Takshaka was saved.|$|E
5|$|Both Gray and Torrey {{were elected}} to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in December 1841. Gray never {{returned}} to <b>teach</b> <b>a</b> course at Michigan. In 1833 Dr.Joshua Fisher, a resident of Beverly, Massachusetts, and a Harvard University alumnus, bequeathed $20,000 to Harvard to endow a chair in natural history. The university allowed the proceeds to accumulate until it could fund a full year's salary for a professor. Because of this and a few problems in finding a suitable professor, this chair was not filled until it was formally offered to Gray on March26, 1842. The offer was $1,000/year salary, teaching duties limited to only botany, and being superintendent of Harvard's botanic garden. While the salary was low, the teaching limitation, rare for the time, allowed him {{plenty of time to}} do research and work in the botanic garden. After an exchange of letters, Gray accepted this appointment as Fisher Professor of Natural History at Harvard. The formal appointment was made April30, 1842. Gray arrived at Harvard on July22, 1842, and began his duties in September. He did not have to teach in the fall of 1842, but began in spring 1843, the first classes he had taught in nine years. Early in his years at Harvard, Gray had to borrow money from his father. Soon he was able to repay his father and help his family because he supplemented his income by giving lectures outside of Harvard, including at the Lowell Institute. Gray was considered a weak lecturer, but because of his expert knowledge, he was highly regarded by his peers. His skills were better suited to teaching advanced rather than introductory classes. He also gained renown for his textbooks and high quality illustrations. Gray moved into {{what became known as the}} Asa Gray House in the Botanic Garden in the summer of 1844. It had been built in 1810 for William Dandridge Peck and later occupied by Thomas Nuttall. As the demands of teaching, collecting, selling specimens, taking care of the herbarium, and writing books increased and he himself was not a good illustrator, Gray found it necessary to hire a botanical illustratorIsaac Sprague, who illustrated much of Gray's works for decades to come.|$|E
