5|$|During the May 21, 2001 {{episode of}} Raw Is War, he {{suffered}} a legitimate and career-threatening injury. In the night's main event, he and Austin were defending the WWF Tag Team Championship against Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit. At one point, Jericho had Austin trapped in the Walls of Jericho and Triple H ran in to break it up, but just as he did, {{he suffered a}} tear in his left quadriceps muscle, causing it to come completely off the bone. Despite his inability to place any weight on his leg, Triple H was able to complete the match. He even allowed Jericho {{to put him in}} the Walls of Jericho, a move <b>that</b> <b>places</b> considerable stress on the quadriceps. The tear required an operation, which was performed by orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews. This injury brought an abrupt end to the McMahon-Helmsley Era, as the rigorous rehabilitation process kept Triple H out of action for over eight months, completely missing The Invasion storyline.|$|E

When the girl opens the Yumetaro gift, she is delighted. Yumetaro becomes the girl's favorite, and so her other toys no longer feel loved. One night, the toys come alive and take the girl to another dimension. The only one left is Yumetaro, who follows the toys in search of the girl.|$|E
5|$|In Brown's {{arrangement}} of the genus, B.sphaerocarpa was placed between B.pulchella and B.nutans in taxonomic sequence; that is, an order <b>that</b> <b>places</b> related taxa next to each other. No subdivision of the genus was given, other than to separate a single distinctive species into a subgenus of its own. Swiss botanist Carl Meissner published a more detailed arrangement in 1856, placing B.sphaerocarpa in section Eubanksia because its inflorescence is a spike rather than a domed head, and in series Abietinae, whose members have inrolled leaf margins with no, or only very fine, serrations. Meissner also published a variety, B.sphaerocarpa var. glabrescens, based on specimens collected by James Drummond; this is now considered a synonym of B.incana.|$|E

While Pyrrhus {{and most of his}} counsellors interpreted the dream as indicating that they would seize Sparta by storm, his friend Lysimachus warned him <b>that</b> <b>places</b> struck by thunderbolts were usually avoided and that Pyrrhus was destined not to enter Sparta. Pyrrhus dismissed this interpretation and buoyed by what he deemed to be a portentous sign, he prepared his men for a further assault.|$|E
5|$|The {{readmission}} of the Scottish Football Association to FIFA {{meant that}} Scotland were now eligible {{to enter the}} 1950 FIFA World Cup.

Scotland won their first two matches, but a 1–0 home defeat by England meant that the Scots finished as runners-up. This meant that the Scots had qualified by right for the World Cup, but had not met the demand of the SFA to win the Championship. The SFA stood by this proclamation, despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players, supported by England captain Billy Wright and the other England players. The SFA instead sent the Scots {{on a tour of}} North America.|$|E
