5|$|New Labour {{accepted}} the economic efficiency of {{free markets and}} believed {{that they could be}} detached from capitalism to achieve the aims of socialism, while maintaining the efficiency of capitalism. Markets were also useful for giving power to consumers and allowing citizens <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions</b> and act responsibly. New Labour embraced market economics because they believed they could be used for their social aims, as well as economic efficiency. The party did not believe that public ownership was efficient or desirable; ensuring that they were not seen to be ideologically pursuing centralised public ownership was important to the party. In government, the party relied on public-private partnerships and private finance initiatives to raise funds and mitigate fears of a 'tax and spend' policy or excessive borrowing.|$|E

25|$|Autonomy {{can come}} into {{conflict}} with beneficence when patients disagree with recommendations that healthcare professionals believe are in the patient's best interest. When the patient's interests conflict with the patient's welfare, different societies settle the conflict {{in a wide range}} of manners. In general, Western medicine defers to the wishes of a mentally competent patient <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions,</b> even in cases where the medical team believes that they are not acting in their own best interests. However, many other societies prioritize beneficence over autonomy.|$|E

Rather than protect adult performers, a condom mandate pushes a legal industry underground where workers are less safe. This is terrible policy that has been defeated in other legislative venues.|$|E
25|$|In April 2014, the United States Senate {{debated the}} Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S. 1737; 113th Congress). The bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to {{increase}} the federal minimum wage for employees to $10.10 per hour {{over the course of}} a two-year period. The bill was strongly supported by President Barack Obama and many of the Democratic Senators, but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House. Portman opposed the bill, arguing that Ohio already had a higher minimum wage than the federal minimum wage, indicating that the states should be able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions.</b>|$|E
500|$|Following his {{election}} as BNP leader, Griffin {{was invited to}} participate in debates at several universities. In November 2002, the Cambridge Union Society invited him {{to take part in a}} debate the following January. Titled [...] "This house believes that Islam is a threat to the west", the resolution was controversial; alongside more moderate speakers, one of those invited was Abu Hamza al-Masri, a fundamentalist Muslim cleric. Some participants threatened to withdraw, and several official bodies criticised the invitations. The two had met earlier in the year, in a debate chaired by Rod Liddle, then editor of BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He was also invited by the Cambridge Forum to a debate on extremism in December 2002, with Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Öpik. The venue was changed twice after protests from property owners, but the threat of a violent confrontation between the Anti-Nazi League and BNP supporters forced the president of the Cambridge Forum, Chris Paley, to cancel the event. Paley called the decision an [...] "own goal" [...] for the values of free speech, and Öpik criticised it, emphasising his belief in [...] "people's right <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions</b> in a democracy".|$|E

2500|$|While {{the film}} depicts the Alliance as an all-powerful, authoritarian-style regime, Whedon {{is careful to}} point out that it is not so simple as that. [...] "The Alliance isn't some evil empire", he explains, but rather a largely benevolent bureaucratic force. The Alliance's main problem is that it seeks to govern everyone, {{regardless}} of whether they desire to belong to the central government or not.

The early sect known as the Ebionites are considered to have practiced vegetarianism. Surviving fragments from their Gospel indicate their belief that – as Christ is the Passover sacrifice and eating the Passover lamb is no longer required – a vegetarian diet may (or should) be observed. However, orthodox Christianity does not accept their teaching as authentic. Indeed, their specific injunction to strict vegetarianism was cited {{as one of the}} Ebionites' [...] "errors".|$|E

[...] instead of the haphazard and partial one that followed one year later.

2500|$|Job {{characteristics}} are {{attributes of the}} job that people traditionally find important, including {{the extent to which}} they identify with the tasks they are doing (identity), {{the extent to which they}} are assigned diverse tasks (variety), extent to which they feel their work affects others (significance), extent to which they receive productive feedback from their job (feedback), and the extent to which they feel they are allowed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions</b> at their job (autonomy). [...] These characteristics play an important role in influencing the relationship between an individual's core self-evaluations and their satisfaction with their job. [...] Studies have found that perceived job characteristics partially mediate the relationship between core self-evaluations and job satisfaction. [...] In other words, a person who appraises themselves positively (i.e., has high core self-evaluations) and has acquired a job which encompasses the aforementioned characteristics of identity, variety, significance, feedback, and autonomy, will be more likely to be satisfied with the job.|$|E

2500|$|Transgender-specific speech {{patterns}} that are gender non-specific include [...] "decoupl the specific corporeal characteristics of [...] from the masculinity [...] entailed by words like dick [...]" [...] Referring to genitals as a transgender person requires a {{suspension of the}} gendered reality of traditional Eurocentric anatomical standards; describing clitorises as 'cocks,' vaginas as 'front holes,' penises as 'girl dicks' or 'clits' both subverts societal expectations of the genitals themselves, and deconstructs the binarism of genital descriptions. This in turn helps normalize intersex experiences, as genital, reproductive, endocrine, and secondary sexual characteristics do not always follow binary, easily categorizable rules, and blurring the line between [...] "vagina" [...] and [...] "penis" [...] both allows transgender individuals to describe themselves more comfortably and validly and intersex individuals <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions</b> about intersex surgery, or genital reconstructive surgery, as consenting adults and to be more visible and accepted in medical and social communities as non-conforming to binary sex descriptors.|$|E
2500|$|Several feminist outlets {{were pleased}} with the show for its feminist twist on fairy tales.

Natalie Wilson from Ms. praised the show for a strong, [...] "kick-butt" [...] female lead, for including multiple strong women who take turns doing the saving with the men, for subverting the fetishization of true love, and for dealing with the idea of what makes a mother in a more nuanced fashion. Wilson went on to state about the lead: [...] "Her pursuit of a 'happy ending' is not about finding a man or going to a ball all gussied up, but about detective work, about building a relationship with her son Henry, and about seeking the 'truth' as to why time stands still in the corrupt Storybrooke world.|$|E
2500|$|Sex {{education}} {{is still a}} debate in the United States to this day. Some parents believe that their children's school programs encourage sexual activity, and the schools {{believe that there are}} many students that don't get any sex education at home. The goal for the parents is for their children to follow their family values. Parents want the ability to teach their children what they want about sex education rather than school programs teaching them of things that certain things that parents are trying to avoid. Sex education programs in schools are mainly trying to give the students a complete picture about sex and sexuality. They want students to know their bodies as well as know how to protect them and make smart decisions. In a study titled [...] "Emerging Answers: Research Findings on Programs to reduce Teen Pregnancy" [...] showed that sex education programs in schools are having a huge impact on teen's decisions to remain abstinent or to use contraceptives if they do choose to have intercourse (1). School programs are teaching students everything they need to know about sex and sexuality and that is helping these same students <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions</b> and to be safe no matter what they choose to do.|$|E
