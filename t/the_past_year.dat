5|$|Lesbians in the U.S. are {{estimated}} to be about 2.6% of the population, according to a National Opinion Research Center survey of sexually active adults who had had same-sex experiences within <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>year,</b> completed in 2000. A survey of same-sex couples in the United States showed that between 2000 and 2005, the number of people claiming to be in same-sex relationships increased by 30%—five times the rate of population growth in the U.S. The study attributed the jump to people being more comfortable self-identifying as homosexual to the federal government.|$|E

5|$|Panic {{reactions}} {{can occur}} after consumption of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, {{especially if the}} ingestion is accidental or otherwise unexpected. Reactions characterized by violent behavior, suicidal thoughts, schizophrenia-like psychosis, and convulsions {{have been reported in}} the literature. A 2005 survey conducted in the United Kingdom found that almost a quarter of those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>year</b> had experienced a panic attack. Other adverse effects less frequently reported include paranoia, confusion, prolonged derealization (disconnection from reality), and mania. Psilocybin usage can temporarily induce a state of depersonalization disorder. Usage by those with schizophrenia can induce acute psychotic states requiring hospitalization.|$|E

5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving {{are associated with}} certain demographic, environmental, and dive style factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, gender, body mass index, smoking, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous decompression illness, years since certification, dives in the last year, number of diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, last dive depth, nitrox use, and drysuit use. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, or body mass index. Increased depth, previous DCI, larger number of consecutive days diving, and being male were associated with higher risk for decompression {{sickness and}} arterial gas embolism. Nitrox and drysuit use, greater frequency of diving in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>year,</b> increasing age, and years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{with severe}} mental illness, {{including}} schizophrenia, {{are at a}} significantly greater risk of being victims of both violent and non-violent crime. Schizophrenia {{has been associated with}} a higher rate of violent acts, but most appear to be related to associated substance abuse. Rates of homicide linked to psychosis are similar to those linked to substance misuse, and parallel the overall rate in a region. What role schizophrenia has on violence independent of drug misuse is controversial, but certain aspects of individual histories or mental states may be factors. About 11% of people in prison for homicide have schizophrenia while 21% have mood disorders. Another study found about 8-10% of people with schizophrenia had committed a violent act in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>year</b> compared to 2% of the general population.|$|E
5|$|Katherine {{continues}} to pursue Mike, believing {{that he is}} {{still in love with}} her. Mike warns her to leave his family alone and claims he never truly loved her. After he leaves, Katherine calls 9-1-1 asking for an ambulance, and then stabs herself with a knife with Mike's fingerprints on it. Katherine frames Mike for her wound. Susan, realizing that Katherine has suffered a total nervous breakdown, calls Katherine's daughter, Dylan (Lyndsy Fonseca), who comes to town and has her mother committed for psychiatric observation. Susan later forgives Katherine once she recovers from her breakdown. Soon after, Mike reveals that he has accumulated an immense debt in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>year.</b> Unable to balance their debt, Susan and Mike decide to move off Wisteria Lane and rent their house out temporarily. They move into an apartment across town while Paul Young rents their house on Wisteria Lane.|$|E
