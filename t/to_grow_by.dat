The elderly population was forecast <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>by</b> 57.9%, with the borough adding 108,000 persons ages 65 and over, compared to 44.2% growth citywide. However, these 2006 projections may have become outdated, as Lower Manhattan has been experiencing a baby boom, well above the overall birth rate in Manhattan, with the area south of Canal Street witnessing 1,086 births in 2010, 12% greater than 2009 and over twice the number born in 2001. The Financial District alone has witnessed growth in its population to approximately 43,000 , nearly double the 23,000 recorded at the 2000 Census. The southern tip of Manhattan became the fastest growing part of New York City between 1990 and 2014.|$|E

5|$|First {{inhabited}} for a {{short period}} {{in the second half of}} the fourth millennium BC, it was repopulated around 2800 BC and continued <b>to</b> <b>grow.</b> <b>By</b> 2000 BC, it became the capital of a regional kingdom that spread its authority over large swathes of the central and southern Levant. The kingdom enjoyed good relations with Mari, but was engaged in constant warfare against Yamhad. By the 15th century BC, Qatna lost its hegemony and came under the authority of Mitanni. It later changed hands between the former and Egypt, until it was conquered and sacked by the Hittites in the late 14th century BC. Following its destruction, the city was reduced in size before being abandoned by the 13th century BC. It was re-inhabited in the 10th century BC, becoming a center of the kingdoms of Palistin then Hamath until it was destroyed by the Assyrians in 720 BC, which reduced it to a small village that eventually disappeared in the 6th century BC. In the 19th century AD, the site was populated by villagers who were evacuated into the newly built village of al-Mishrifeh in 1982. The site has been excavated since the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{the city}} has {{experienced}} steady population growth, and has been faced {{with the issue of}} accommodating more residents. In 2006, after growing by 4,000citizens per year for the previous 16 years, regional planners expected the population of Seattle <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>by</b> 200,000people by2040. However, former mayor Greg Nickels supported plans that would increase the population by 60%, or 350,000people, by 2040 and worked on ways to accommodate this growth while keeping Seattle's single-family housing zoning laws. The Seattle City Council later voted to relax height limits on buildings in the greater part of Downtown, partly with the aim to increase residential density in the city center. As a sign of increasing inner-city growth, the downtown population crested to over 60,000 in 2009, up 77% since 1990.|$|E
5|$|The nominal gross {{domestic}} product (GDP) of Uttar Pradesh grew {{at an annual rate}} of 8 to 12 percent between 2002–03 and 2006-07. When Mayawati began her five-year tenure as chief minister from May 2007, the average annual state GDP growth rate between 2007–08 and 2010-11 shot up to 17 percent. In financial year 2011, UP’s state GDP was predicted <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>by</b> 11 per cent. Thus, UP’s nominal GDP growth in these four years (2007–11) was almost the same as what the entire country clocked in that period. State’s per capita income went up by 136 per cent from about Rs 11,000 in 2007 to Rs 26,000 in 2011. UP continued to be one of the few states with a revenue surplus and Mayawati has used this surplus to reduce the state’s fiscal deficit from 4 percent of state GDP in 2007-08 to a budgeted figure of 2.97 per cent for the financial year 2011. Mayawati also ensured that the state’s indebtedness came down from 43 percent of state GDP in 2007-08 to 32 percent in 2011-12. Mayawati in her five years added about 4,000 MW of generation capacity to the state’s power sector. Mayawati also planned to create 7,000 MW more generation capacity by the end of 2012 for achieving her target is to make state a power-surplus state by 2017 for which the state is already executing power projects with a total capacity of 10,000 MW.|$|E
