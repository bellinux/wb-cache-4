5|$|In Keegan's first season, 1971–72, Liverpool {{missed out}} on winning the League Championship by a single point, the title going to Brian Clough's Derby County. Shankly {{maintained}} that Liverpool were denied a definite penalty in their crucial away match against Derby and <b>then</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good goal disallowed {{towards the end of}} their final match against Arsenal. Both decisions cost the team a vital point which would have been enough to claim first place. Shankly took encouragement from the team's overall form, especially as they made a strong finish to the season, and he was confident of success in 1972–73.|$|E

Because the government <b>then</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> policy of negotiating fixed-price contracts, these costs could not be evened out by a large production run, which left the total order at 170.|$|E

5|$|While Newell's {{place was}} taken first by Kevin Blackwell and later former player Mick Harford, {{the team was}} then relegated twice in a row, {{starting}} in 2006–07, and spent {{the latter part of}} the 2007–08 season in administration, thus incurring a ten-point deduction from that season's total. The club <b>then</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> total of 30 points docked from its 2008–09 record by the Football Association and the Football League for financial irregularities dating back several years.
