These can even appear inside the mouth (buccal), or on the surface of the eye (scleral). These have irregular borders and range in size from 1mm in diameter to café-au-lait spots, several centimeters in diameter. Also, some areas of vitiligo-like hypopigmentation may be observed.|$|E

5|$|The bird's {{head and}} upper body {{typically}} vary between pale brown and some shade of grey (especially {{on the forehead}} and back) in most subspecies. Some are purer, richer brown instead, and all have fine black-and-white speckles except on the remiges and rectrices (main wing feathers), which are light brown with darker bands. The heart-shaped face is usually bright white, but in some subspecies it is brown. The underparts, including the tarsometatarsal (lower leg) feathers, vary from white to reddish buff among the subspecies, and are either mostly unpatterned or bear a varying number of tiny blackish-brown speckles. It {{has been found that}} at least in the continental European populations, females with more spotting are healthier than plainer birds. This does not hold true for European males by contrast, where the spotting varies according to subspecies. The beak varies from pale horn <b>to</b> <b>dark</b> buff, corresponding to the general plumage hue, and the iris is blackish brown. The talons, like the beak, vary in colour, ranging from pink <b>to</b> <b>dark</b> pinkish-grey and the talons are black.|$|E

The normal colour of a French Spaniel's coat is white with brown markings rather in shade from a light cinnamon <b>to</b> <b>dark</b> liver. Historically, the coat was only white with black markings, but the breed was mixed with other colours of Spaniels during the 19th century.|$|E

It was to feature a cooperative multiplayer mode for two players, each controlling one of the two characters: the gun-wielding Jacob and the magic-using Emily (in its early version, Tainted Legacy, they were Joshua and Jack Walters' granddaughter Madeline). Its gameplay was publicly presented during the E3 2005.|$|E

5|$|Flea larvae {{emerge from}} the eggs to feed on any {{available}} organic material such as dead insects, faeces, conspecific eggs, and vegetable matter. In laboratory studies, some dietary diversity seems necessary for proper larval development. Blood-only diets allow only 12% of larvae to mature, whereas blood and yeast or dog chow diets allow almost all larvae to mature. Another study also showed that 90% of larvae matured into adults when the diet included nonviable eggs. They are blind and avoid sunlight, keeping <b>to</b> <b>dark,</b> humid places such as sand or soil, cracks and crevices, under carpets and in bedding.|$|E
5|$|Following {{in a long}} {{tradition}} of all-American teenager Archie Andrews meeting unusual celebrities and pop culture icons, this comic book shows him meeting the galaxy's deadliest hunter, the Predator. The idea was first suggested in the Archie office and then proposed <b>to</b> <b>Dark</b> Horse, who holds the license to comics featuring the Predator character owned by 20th Century Fox. The companies paired de Campi, a horror writer at Dark Horse, with Ruiz, a regular Archie artist. When the comic book was announced, many media outlets noted in their headlines that the new title was not a joke.|$|E

Henson told the Associated Press in 1982 that The Dark Crystal characters evolved directly from his Saturday Night Live creations. Henson described the evolutionary process from The Land of Gorch <b>to</b> <b>Dark</b> Crystal, saying that because The Land of Gorch was featured on late-night television, it helped {{expand the scope}} of his puppets, including risqué behavior. He described the challenge that motivated him to further develop concepts from The Land of Gorch on Dark Crystal, saying his next motivation was to draft a universe of puppets for a feature film without humans.|$|E
