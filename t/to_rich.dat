5|$|Following the turnover, the Eagles' offense {{began work}} at their 46-yard line. Davis {{completed}} a five-yard pass to Robinson, advancing into Tech territory. An incomplete pass followed, but Davis {{was able to}} gain the first down with a pass <b>to</b> <b>Rich</b> Gunnell at the 39-yard line. On the first pass after the first down, Davis and Gunnell connected on a deep pass, but Gunnell fumbled and the ball was recovered {{in the end zone}} by a Virginia Tech defender. The play resulted in a touchback, and Virginia Tech took over on offense at its 20-yard line.

5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>rich</b> dinosaur fossils, {{there are}} also plant fossils that illustrate the reduction in plant species across the K–Pg boundary. In the sediments below the K–Pg boundary the dominant plant remains are angiosperm pollen grains, but the boundary layer contains little pollen and is dominated by fern spores. More usual pollen levels gradually resume above the boundary layer. This is reminiscent of areas blighted by modern volcanic eruptions, where the recovery is led by ferns, which are later replaced by larger angiosperm plants.|$|E

5|$|Sea {{fishing is}} an {{important}} industry for Northern coastal towns. Major fishing ports include Fleetwood, Grimsby, Hull and Whitby. At its height, Grimsby was the largest fishing port in the world, but the Northern fishing industry suffered greatly {{from a series of}} events {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century: the Cod Wars with Iceland and establishment of the exclusive economic zone ended British access <b>to</b> <b>rich</b> North Atlantic fishing grounds, while the North Sea was badly overfished and the European Common Fisheries Policy put strict quotas on catches to protect the almost depleted stocks. Grimsby is now transitioning to the processing of imported seafood and to offshore wind to replace its fishing fleet.|$|E

Each room has distinct furnishings and from moderate <b>to</b> <b>rich</b> decoration. One particular was the Moorish room, furnished in the Moorish style, with mantel and furniture inlaid with mother of pearl. The third floor had bedrooms, a children's suite and a large playroom.|$|E
5|$|In 1646–47, Ashmole {{made several}} {{simultaneous}} approaches <b>to</b> <b>rich</b> widows {{in the hope}} of securing a good marriage. In 1649, he married Mary, Lady Mainwaring (daughter of Sir William Forster of Aldermaston), a wealthy thrice-widowed woman twenty years his senior; she may have been a relative by marriage of his first wife's family and was the mother of grown children. The marriage took place despite the opposition of the bride's family, and it did not prove to be harmonious: Lady Mainwaring filed suit for separation and alimony but it was dismissed by the courts in 1657. Nevertheless, the marriage provided Ashmole with Mary's first husband's estates centred on Bradfield in Berkshire which left him wealthy enough to pursue his interests, including botany and alchemy, without concern for having to earn a living. He arranged for his friend Wharton to be released from prison and appointed him to manage the estates.|$|E

5|$|Warwick {{had planned}} for Edward {{to marry a}} French princess—Bona of Savoy—to create an {{alliance}} between the two countries. The young king, however, favoured ties with Burgundy and, in 1464, further angered the Earl by secretly marrying Elizabeth Woodville; as an impoverished Lancastrian widow, she was regarded by the Yorkists as an unsuitable queen. Edward bestowed gifts of land and titles on her relations and arranged their marriages <b>to</b> <b>rich</b> and powerful families. Eligible bachelors were paired with the Woodville females, narrowing the marriage prospects for Warwick's daughters. Furthermore, the Earl was offended by two matches involving his kin. The first was the marriage of his aunt, Lady Katherine Neville, over 60years old, to Elizabeth's 20-year-old brother, John Woodville, a pairing considered outside of normal wedlock by many people. The other was his nephew's fiancée, the daughter of Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, who was taken as a bride by the Queen's son, Thomas Grey, with Edward's approval. Exasperated by these acts, Warwick decided the Woodvilles were a malignant influence on his liege. He felt marginalized: his influence over the young king was failing, {{and he decided to}} take drastic action to force Edward's compliance. Warwick's alternative plan was to replace the King with his fellow conspirator, the Duke of Clarence, Edward's younger brother.|$|E
5|$|Finishing {{the regular}} season as the seventh seed, Washington was matched up with the {{defending}} champion Boston Bruins. As Tomas Vokoun and Michal Neuvirth were still injured, the Capitals were forced to start Braden Holtby in Game 1. Through the first two periods, Boston was {{in control of the}} game, out-shooting Washington 26–7. Despite the disparity in shots, the game remained tied 0–0 after regulation. Washington lost the game shortly into overtime. They rebounded to tie the series when Nicklas Backstrom scored in double overtime of game two. Through the first two games of the series, Holtby stopped 72 of 74 Bruins' shots. In Game 3, the two teams again looked to be heading to overtime tied 3–3 late in the third when Backstrom took a penalty. Zdeno Chara scored on the man advantage with under two minutes remaining, giving Boston the win. After the game ended, Backstrom was given a match penalty for intent to injure following a cross-check <b>to</b> <b>Rich</b> Peverley. Backstrom received a one-game suspension for his actions. Without Backstrom in Game 4, the Capitals evened the series with a 2–1 victory that featured a 44-save performance from Holtby. The Capitals took their first lead in the series thanks to a Troy Brouwer power-play goal with 1:27 left in regulation of game five. Facing elimination, Boston did not trail throughout Game 6 and was in position to win late in the third. However, an Alexander Ovechkin goal led to overtime, were Tyler Seguin scored to force a seventh and deciding game. Game 7 went to overtime, where a dump-in attempt was blocked by Mike Knuble, giving him a breakaway. He took a backhand that was stopped by Boston's Tim Thomas. Joel Ward followed the play and scored the game-winning goal on the rebound. With Washington's victory in the series, Holtby became just the third rookie goaltender in NHL history to defeat the reigning Stanley Cup champions. It was also the first playoff series in NHL history which all seven games were decided by one goal.|$|E
