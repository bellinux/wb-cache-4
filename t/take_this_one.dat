5|$|Although {{designed}} {{by one of}} Square's development teams in Japan, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was specifically geared for the U.S. market. At the time, console role-playing games were not a major genre in North America; Square thus attempted to broaden the genre's appeal through Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. Square had already released several Final Fantasy spinoffs in North America, including the first three titles in the SaGa series as Final Fantasy Legend, and the first Mana series game as Final Fantasy Adventure, and wished to further break into the popular American consciousness. Square's executives cited the alleged difficulty of RPGs as the reason Americans shied away from them, and eased the difficulty level by tweaking {{various aspects of the}} main series' gameplay. The American release of Final Fantasy IV was altered to make the game simpler, for example. Mystic Quest was to <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> step further, and the Japanese developers worked with the American offices to make sure the game was accessible to children.|$|E
500|$|The music used in {{the segment}} of the episode where Squidward's marching band is playing while coming down the street was from Nick Carr, the series' music editor. He found a piece of marching band music that was a band {{intentionally}} playing poorly, but sound designer Jeff Hutchins said, [...] "You could still discern the tune." [...] Hutchins thought [...] "Well, let's <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> step further. What if they couldn't even play their instruments, let alone a tune?" [...] He brought his portable DAT recorder to a musical instrument retail store and met two men who worked on its loading dock, packaging and shipping the instruments. Hutchins made the two men play most of the instruments terribly. He said, [...] "I got these two guys to squeak, blast, and squawk {{on most of the}} instruments they sold." ...|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps as a {{means of}} {{avoiding}} or clarifying some ambiguities created by the fact that [...] "este" [...] ( [...] > [...] ) and [...] "esse" [...] have merged into the same word, informal BP often uses the demonstrative pronoun with some adverb that indicates its placement in relation to the addressee: if there are two skirts in a room and one says, Pega essa saia para mim (Take this skirt for me), there may be some doubt about which of them must be taken so one may say Pega essa aí (<b>Take</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> there near you") in the original sense of the use of [...] "essa", or Pega essa saia aqui (<b>Take</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> here).|$|E

6000|$|... "How {{would it}} be," [...] said the mate, {{after a long}} pause, and {{speaking}} very slowly; [...] "how would it be if I <b>took</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> off your hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Mrs. Mickleham {{indicates}} politely {{that if she}} <b>took</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> {{it would}} have to swim for it. (The Haggerty Woman takes it long afterwards when she thinks, erroneously, that no one is looking.) ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Please {{turn that}} {{cardboard}} face down, and <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> {{and compare it}} searchingly, by the magnifier, with the fatal signature upon the knife handle, and report your finding to the court." ...|$|E
6000|$|Harold {{took her}} ungloved hand tenderly in his, {{and drew a}} ring off her finger. [...] "Before I give you mine," [...] he said, [...] "you will let me <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>one?</b> I want it for a keepsake and a memorial." ...|$|E
6000|$|As plays were {{constantly}} {{coming in to}} them, Hugh <b>took</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> quite {{as a matter of}} routine, with expectation of being bored. He was a little surprised next morning when she asked, [...] "Did you look into that manuscript?" ...|$|R
50|$|Joseph Bower (1970) and Robert Burgelman (1980) <b>took</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> step further. Not {{only are}} {{strategic}} decisions made incrementally {{rather than as}} part of a grand unified vision, but according to them, this multitude of small decisions are made by numerous people in all sections and levels of the organization.|$|R
5000|$|... eCRM allows {{customers}} to access company services from {{more and more}} places, since the Internet access points are increasing by the day. mCRM however, <b>takes</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> step further and allows customers or managers to access the systems for instance from a mobile phone or PDA with internet access, resulting in high flexibility.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly!' cried Brass, 'the quicker, the better. Mr Richard--have the goodness, sir, to {{take that}} arm. I'll <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>one.</b> It's not easy walking three abreast, but under these {{circumstances}} it must be done, sir; there's no help for it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did. My {{action was}} hardly justifiable, perhaps, but I thought it better {{that the police}} shouldn't get on the track of matters that haven't much bearing on Clarke's death. I found two things, and they're both of {{interest}} to us. We'll <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> of course, uncle. The {{other is}} fashionable, and yes I must say I think it's pretty but it's very heavy, and I {{should have to}} go round like a walking doll if I wore it. I'm much obliged to auntie, but I'll keep this, please." ...|$|E
50|$|The Storyteller System used {{in games}} like Vampire: The Masquerade <b>took</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> step further, {{breaking}} the attributes down into three by three classifications. Power, Finesse, and Resistance, and Mental, Physical, and Social, leading to nine different combinations {{each of which}} has a separate name with, for example, Mental Finesse being the attribute Wits and Social Resistance being Composure.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Wheresoever a holy and a wise woman speaks, {{a warrior}} {{need not be}} ashamed of listening. Did not Alaric bid us spare the nuns in Rome, comrade? And though I am no Christian as he was, I thought it no shame for Odin's man to take their blessing; nor will I to <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>one's,</b> Smid, son of Troll.' ...|$|R
50|$|Waveform {{playback}} is {{the most}} common and allows a 32 byte, 5 bit unsigned linear sample to be played back at selected frequencies. Frequency modulation <b>takes</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> step further, allowing the playback frequency to be dynamically adjusted according to a specified pattern. White noise is used to simulate percussion instruments and effects, such as explosions, by means of a pseudo-random square wave.|$|R
6000|$|... "As I {{think you}} told me you couldn't shoot, I'll give you a short lecture on the {{principles}} of the thing. When they're after birds most men use a scatter gun. It will spread an ounce of shot--several hundred pellets--over a six-foot circle at a distance of about forty yards; but the rifle is the great weapon of western America. <b>Take</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> and open the breach--now look up the barrel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{not looking}} as well {{yourself}} as I'd like to see you, Marilla. You look tired. I'm afraid you've been working too hard. You must take a rest, now that I'm home. I'm just going to <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> day off to visit all the dear old spots and hunt up my old dreams, {{and then it will}} be your turn to be lazy while I do the work." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{see it all}} now: when I {{wanted a}} king, [...] 'Twas the kingship that failed in myself I was seeking,-- [...] 90 'Tis so much less easy to do than to sing, [...] So much simpler to reign by a proxy than be king! Yes, I think I do see; after all's said and sung, [...] <b>Take</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> rule of life and you never will rue it,-- 'Tis but do your own duty and hold your own tongue [...] And Blondel were royal himself, if he knew it! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd bore me, Humphrey," [...] said she, as {{she climbed}} into her runabout {{with the father}} and {{grandfather}} of the absentee. Mr. Crewe laughed as she drove away. He had a chemical quality of turning invidious remarks into compliments, and he <b>took</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> as Victoria's manner of saying {{that she did not}} wish to disturb so important a man.|$|R
50|$|A 2010 {{investigation}} <b>took</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> {{step further}} {{by using the}} ECM scaffold to produce entire lungs in vitro to be transplanted into living rats. These successfully enabled gas exchange but for short time intervals only. Nevertheless, this was a huge leap towards whole lung regeneration and transplants for humans, which has already taken another step forward with the lung regeneration of a non-human primate.|$|R

6000|$|... "It isn't natural," [...] she decided, [...] "with the sun {{rising and}} the day still freshly {{beginning}} that you should go or that I should go. I've wanted to meet you like this and talk about things,--ten thousand times. And as for me Stephen I won't go. And I won't let you go if I can help it. Not this morning, anyhow. No. Go {{later in the day}} if you will, and let us two <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> talk that God Himself has given us. We've not planned it. It's His doing, not ours." ...|$|E
60|$|This remark {{made me feel}} nervous. I did {{not know}} at what moment {{there might be a}} rush for this boat, nor when, indeed, the steamer might go down. The boat {{amidships}} on our side had rowed away some minutes before, and through the darkness I could distinguish another boat, near the bows, pushing off. It would be too late now for us to try to get into any other boat, and I did not feel that there was time enough for me to <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> to a place where the two women could more easily descend to her. Standing upright, I urged them not to delay.|$|E
6000|$|The light, the air, the waters, all defiled! How of {{the earth}} itself? <b>Take</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> fact for type of honour done by the modern Swiss to the earth of his native land. There {{used to be a}} little rock {{at the end of the}} avenue by the port of Neuchâtel; there, the last marble of the foot of Jura, sloping to the blue water, and (at this time of year) covered with bright pink tufts of Saponaria. I went, three days since, to gather a blossom at the place. The goodly native rock and its flowers were covered with the dust and refuse of the town; but, in the middle of the avenue, was a newly-constructed {{artificial}} rockery, with a fountain twisted through a spinning spout, and an inscription on one of its loose-tumbled stones,-- ...|$|E
5000|$|A Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy is {{shot down}} on Christmas Eve when he stumbles upon a robbery-homicide at a {{convenience}} store. A down-on-his-luck L.A. County Sheriff's Dept. homicide detective, Jerry Beck (Johnson), {{is assigned to}} the case. As with every case, he <b>takes</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> very emotionally, because [...] "the job" [...] {{is the last thing}} left in his life, and vows to get the perpetrator no matter what.|$|R
50|$|Whilst being a singer/songwriter for a {{rock band}} for over 7 years, Deckscar always had a passion for club music, and began fusing this style with his rock outfit. In 2010 he <b>took</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> step forward by getting himself a set of decks. During his years {{studying}} at university in London Deckscar took advantage of his location and the regular student nights on all over the city.|$|R
50|$|A {{wide range}} of animals {{demonstrate}} similar crafting of texts, but to <b>take</b> <b>this</b> seriously, <b>one</b> must wrestle with the implications of how nonhuman animals enter rhetorical situations.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rub it gently, Sammy," [...] said Mrs. Pentecost. [...] "I'll get out {{the bottles}} {{and give you a}} dose. It's his poor stomach, major. Hold my trumpet, somebody--and stop the boat. You take that bottle, Neelie, my dear; and you <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> Mr. Armadale; and give them to me as I want them. Ah, poor dear, I know what's the matter with him! Want of power here, major--cold, acid, and flabby. Ginger to warm him; soda to correct him; sal {{volatile}} to hold him up. There, Sammy! drink it before it settles; and then go and lie down, my dear, in that dog-kennel of a place they call the cabin. No more music!" [...] added Mrs. Pentecost, shaking her forefinger at the proprietor of the concertina--"unless it's a hymn, and that I don't object to." ...|$|E
60|$|My dear boys, <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> thought {{away with}} you from this chapel to-day. Believe that the wise and good of every age and clime are {{looking down on}} you, to see what use you will make of the {{knowledge}} which they have won for you. Whether they laboured, like Kepler in his garret, or like Galileo in his dungeon, hid in God's tabernacle from the strife of tongues; or, like Socrates and Plato, in the whirl and noise--far more wearying and saddening than any loneliness--of the foolish crowd, they all have laboured for you. Let them rejoice, when they see you enter into their labours with heart and soul. Let them rejoice, when they see in each one of {{you one of the}} fairest sights on earth, before men and before God; a docile and innocent boy striving to become a wise and virtuous man.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> {{instance}} of the excellent article called [...] "Nurse's Stories" [...] because it is quite typical of all the rest. Dickens (accused of superficiality by those who cannot grasp that there is foam upon deep seas) was really deep about human beings; that is, he was original and creative about them. But about ideas he did {{tend to be a}} little superficial. He judged them by whether they hit him, and not by what they were trying to hit. Thus in this book the great wizard of the Christmas ghosts seems almost the enemy of ghost stories; thus the almost melodramatic moralist who created Ralph Nickleby and Jonas Chuzzlewit cannot see the point in original sin; thus the great denouncer of official oppression in England may be found far too indulgent to the basest aspects of the modern police. His theories were less important than his creations, because {{he was a man of}} genius. But he himself thought his theories the more important, because he was a man.|$|E
50|$|To {{solve the}} problem with {{sticking}} snow, Head adapted another solution being widely introduced in the industry. TEY, creators of the earlier True-Flex design, faced the same sticking problems and had started selling a tape-on plastic sheet {{that could be used}} with any ski and eliminated the need for waxing. Head <b>took</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> step further, using a thicker phenolic plastic sheet and bonding it to the ski along with the other layers.|$|R
25|$|The Fire Precautions Act had {{relied on}} codes and guides for its implementation, and the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations had changed {{that a little}} by {{introducing}} risk assessment {{as a way of}} complying, but because the requirement for a fire certificate was never repealed, the guides and codes were still used as a prescriptive means of applying the law. The RR (FS) O <b>took</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> step further and implemented fully a risk assessment based regime.|$|R
5000|$|The {{individual}} links are {{representations of}} the poem but are widely varied between themselves. [...] "Six" [...] takes a different through a limited use of text and relying on the reader to make {{an interpretation of the}} work through an image. [...] "Eight" [...] <b>takes</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> step further by completely removing any evidence of text and relies on elements of interactivity by means of the user 'clicking' the image to reveal a multiplication of circles.|$|R
