5|$|Himeji {{was heavily}} bombed in 1945, {{at the end}} of World War II, and {{although}} most of the surrounding area was burned to the ground, the castle survived intact. One firebomb was dropped {{on the top floor of}} the castle but failed to explode. In order to preserve the castle complex, substantial repair work was undertaken starting in 1956, with a labor expenditure of 250,000 man-days and a cost of 550 million yen. In January 1995, the city of Himeji was substantially damaged by the Great Hanshin earthquake, but Himeji Castle again survived virtually undamaged, demonstrating remarkable earthquake resistance.

They discover that the barrier is very thick and that the corridor is also blocked on the foundation level.

Mac (Tina Majorino) is called in for tech support when an animal research lab is raided and a valuable monkey is stolen, and Mac asks Veronica for help. The researchers believe that a PETA-like organization, named PHAT, is responsible. At the PHAT meeting, Mac flirts with the group leader, Bronson, {{but there is no}} reason to think that they’re guilty. Weevil invites Keith to investigate Dean O’Dell’s office, and he finds a 40-year-old bottle of scotch unopened.

Corky will be next-door, waiting until she hears Caesar turn on the shower. When he does, Violet will drop <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> Scotch that is for Gino and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more.

Suspicious, Caesar will check the briefcase, find the money gone, and assume Johnnie has taken it. Corky and Violet think Caesar will be forced to skip town because Gino will assume he has been robbed by Caesar, not his son.|$|E

Other containers have emerged: the brick from Tetra Pak, <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> polyethylene terephthalate or PET, the beverage can, and the Bag-In-Box.

25|$|Assembling the {{suspects}} together along with Carla, Poirot makes his denouement about the murder. Although Phillip's hostility to Caroline {{was due to}} her rejection of his love for her, and Meredith's sympathy was due to his weariness for his long affection for her, leading him to form an attachment to Elsa that was unreciprocated, both brothers' emotions were merely red herrings. In putting together the case, he reveals that Caroline had been innocent, but did not defend herself in court, because she believed that Angela had committed the murder; the evidence Poirot had uncovered showed that her younger sister had been angry with Amyas and had put salt in his glass as a prank. She {{had the opportunity to}} steal the poison from Meredith {{on the morning of the}} crime, and was seen fiddling with <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> beer that Caroline would take down to him. However, Caroline did not wish her sister to be charged for the crime, having felt a deep guilt for injuring her sister in a fit of jealous rage many years ago, which had left Angela blinded in one eye and with a permanent scar on the left side of her face. Therefore, she took steps to take the blame for her crime in order to earn redemption, which explained why she did not claim she was innocent in the letter she sent Angela but believed Angela knew Caroline was. However, Poirot reveals that Caroline's actions had actually proved her innocence, as she had wiped the fingerprints off the bottle because she believed that the poison had been put in it rather than in the glass, and that she would have no need to remove her own--thus, she was removing those of a third party. Furthermore, he reveals that Angela was not the killer, as she had been at Meredith's lab in order to steal valerian from him in preparation for playing another prank on Amyas, but never carried out the act because of the murder, deducing this from the way that she spoke of the theft in the future tense to Poirot.|$|E
