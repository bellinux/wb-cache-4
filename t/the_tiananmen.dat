5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tiananmen</b> Square {{self-immolation}} incident {{took place}} in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing, {{on the eve of}} Chinese New Year on 23 January 2001. The incident is disputed; Chinese government sources say that five members of Falun Gong, a spiritual practice that is persecuted in mainland China, set themselves on fire in the square. Falun Gong sources disputed the accuracy of these portrayals, noting that their teachings explicitly forbid violence or suicide. Several Western journalists and scholars also noted inconsistencies in the government's account of event, suggesting the self-immolations were staged by the government to discredit Falun Gong.|$|E
5|$|A {{systemic}} transformation happening {{sooner rather}} than later was made possible by the Polish legislative elections of 4 June 1989, which coincided with the bloody crackdown on <b>the</b> <b>Tiananmen</b> Square protesters in China. When the results of the voting were released, a political earthquake followed. The victory of Solidarity surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the Sejm, while in the newly established Senate they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats (the other seat went to an independent, who later switched to Solidarity). At the same time, many prominent PZPR candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved for them. The communists suffered a catastrophic blow to their legitimacy.|$|E

The detectives go to Washington, D.C. {{to talk to the}} Chinese embassy about the murder, but they deny any knowledge of the incident. Secret Service agent Gruszynski (Ed Lauter) confronts Lewis and Crosetti and tells them not to waste the embassy's time, but agrees to give the detectives a tour of Washington before they go. Crosetti is excited to see the landmarks but Lewis, who believes the Secret Service agent knows who committed the murder, remains confrontational with Gruszynski. When Gruszynski still refuses to help, Crosetti and a frustrated Lewis leave Washington.|$|E
