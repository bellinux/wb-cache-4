However, both have their limitations: PVS is inherently hydrophobic, and PE is rigid. In order {{to take advantage of the}} desirable qualities of both PVS and PE impression materials, a new generation of impression material is being developed called vinyl polyether silicone (VPES, GC). The purpose of the present study was to compare the properties of hydrophilic PVS, PE, and VPES in regard to surface detail reproduction, contact angle, and <b>tear</b> <b>strength.</b> The hypotheses to be tested were: 1) VPES will show a significant superiority insurface detail reproduction compared with PVS and PE impression materials; 2) VPES will show a significant superiority in wettability compared with PVS and PE impression materials; 3) VPES will show a significant superiority in <b>tear</b> <b>strength</b> compared with PVS and PE impression materials. In order to test the surface detail reproduction, impressions were made of stainless steel dies with a parallel series of 15 different width lines on the surface and tested under dry and moist conditions. The wettability was assessed by contact angles of saturated CaSO 4 aqueous solution drops on flat impression surfaces. A trouser tear test was employed to test the <b>tear</b> <b>strength.</b> The trouser-shaped specimens were prepared and tested in the Instron Universal Testing Machine. The data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Pearson‘s Chi square, (p < 0. 05). All the materials showed better detail reproduction under the dry conditions than the moist conditions. There were no differences between the three materials in detail reproduction when impressing under either moist conditions or dry conditions.

In this work, the relationship between the nitrogen content and swelling index (water retention) were studied. The effects of nitrogen content and swelling index (water retention) on the <b>tear</b> <b>strength</b> and the dynamic water absorbency were investigatedThe results showed that(1) The swelling index (water retention) has a strong linear relationship with the total nitrogen content in the fabric. The higher nitrogen content, the lower the swelling index (water retention). (2) The fabric <b>tear</b> <b>strength</b> is highly correlated with the total nitrogen content or the swelling index (water retention). High nitrogen content or low swelling index (water retention), which may be resulted from the wrinkle-free treatment, causes low <b>tear</b> <b>strength.</b> (3) High nitrogen content or low swelling index (water retention) reduces the water absorption rate of the fabric and increases the contact angle when the water drop is in initial contact of the fabric.
