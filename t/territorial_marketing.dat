40|$|The {{increased}} competition between cities, regions and countries {{has led to}} the development of a relatively new concept known as <b>territorial</b> <b>marketing.</b> These territories compete for investments, resources, labour, residents and tourists etc. In the process of <b>territorial</b> <b>marketing,</b> local activities are coordinated to meet the demand of target customers. In order to sustain the current business and public support as well as attracting new investment, business, tourism or new residents, the territory may need to invest in appealing sub products, such as special events, to help the enhancement of the overall territory as a product. The purpose of this thesis has been to gain a deeper understanding on how special events can be used to constitute a part of <b>territorial</b> <b>marketing.</b> In order to achieve this purpose, a qualitative, single-case study was made on an event management company based in Luleå, Sweden. Data was collected by conducting a face-to-face interview with the project manager of this company. The findings of the study indicate that the hosting of special events can be a way of making the <b>territorial</b> <b>marketing</b> more successful, as the marketing efforts can reach out to a national as well as an international audience.

The metaphor of the “territory as a company” has known in literature a wide agreement and broad spread [2, 3, 4, 5]. According to Hall [6] <b>territorial</b> <b>marketing</b> is the device to develop the economy of a region, to attract investors, to create occupation and promote tourism which, in its turn, {{is more and more}} used as a fulcrum to revieve the regional development strategies. Factors of attractiveness of a territory, which have to be strategically considered marketing activities, can be tangible or intangible [3, 5, 6].

Thirty years since the 1978 Constitution, Spain is a quasi-federal state. Their cultural life and policies have expanded and have been decentralized. The redistribution process {{is a result of the}} search of effectiveness confronted with the question of the legitimization of power. Legitimacy is a permanent theme of debate as well as a discursive and strategic instrument between institutional actors, and it sheds light on the apparent inconsistencies of the multi-level governance of cultural policies. To study the different aspects of these relationships, the article principally focuses on three areas. The first is an institutional analysis, which allows us to determine the place of each institutional actor within the network of cultural policies as well as the horizontal and vertical interactions. The second is an analysis of the public financing of culture, which permits us to measure the quantitative impact of cultural policies within the centre–periphery dynamic. The third is an analysis of public policies, which allows a comparative approach to the dynamics of the autonomous community regime. The dialectic between differentiation and standardization, a mark of cultural policies modernity in the context of centre–periphery relationships, is a result of the pressure from the main players on the different Spanish cultural and <b>territorial</b> <b>markets.</b> Examples of " good practices " mimicry as well as of " new " pattern models, like the new Arts Council of Catalonia, are used to expose the non-existence of a formal Spanish model of cultural policy, but shows the process of innovation-reply product strategies, and the dialectic between political autonomy and homogenization processes...|$|R

40|$|Cemetery {{companies}} were the principal {{agency of the}} transition from a traditional reliance on graveyards to the use of modern extra-mural cemeteries. The thesis comprises a study of the 113 cemetery companies established from 1820 to 1853, a period which saw the origin of this type of enterprise and its spreading throughout Britain. The companies are not analysed as economic entities, but rather as representations of a range of attitudes towards the problems associated with intramural interment. To facilitate discerning different trends relating to the public perceptions of the burial problem, the companies have been classified according to type. This is an exercise which relies on textual analysis of company documents to understand the principal motivation of each group of directors. Three different types of company are examined in the thesis. Directors of enterprises within the first group to emerge saw the burial problem as a religious-political issue, and used cemetery companies as a means of providing extended space for burial which was independent of the Established Church. The new cemeteries had unconsecrated ground, and offered the freedom for Dissenters to adopt any burial service they wished. The increased enthusiasm for all joint-stock enterprise in the mid- 1830 s saw the advent of the speculative cemetery company, which saw in the burial issue the potential to make profits in one of three ways: by tapping a specific <b>territorial</b> <b>market,</b> a particular class market, or by buying and selling the scrip of grand and impractical necropolitan schemes. A third type of company dominated the 1840 s, and its main concern was the provision of extra-mural cemeteries as a sanitary measure. In addition to studies of these three groups of companies, the thesis presents analysis of two additional themes essential to the progress of burial reform: fears concerning the integrity of the corpse; and the cultural significance thought to attach to cemetery foundation. The thesis demonstrates, by studying these companies, that the reasons for taking action to found cemetery companies could vary considerably, and that perception of the burial issue altered a number of times...|$|R

Using micro-level {{data from the}} Farm Business Survey (REA) over the pre- and post- 2003 CAP reform periods, we investigated the impact that operator, family, farm and market characteristics exert on these choices. Among other things, the paper focuses also on the differential impact of those variables for operators of smaller and larger holdings. The main results suggest that operator and family characteristics {{have a significant impact}} on the decision to participate in off-farm work more for smaller than for bigger farms. By contrast, farm characteristics are more relevant variables for bigger farms. In particular, decoupled farm payments, by increasing the marginal productivity of farm labour, lower the probability of working off the farm only in bigger farms, while coupled subsidies in pre-reform years do not {{have a significant impact on}} labour decisions. Finally, we show that, after accounting for the standard covariates, local and <b>territorial</b> labour <b>market</b> characteristics generally have a low effect on off-farm work operators’ choices...|$|R
