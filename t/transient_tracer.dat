40|$|The {{capability}} of transient tracers to constrain the ocean circulation in the North Atlantic is explored. Study of an idealized tracer shows that inferences of circulation properties from transient state distributions are impacted by uncertainties in the time-varying boundary conditions and sparse data coverage. Comparison of CFC, tritium, temperature and salinity (T-S) observations with model {{results in the}} North Atlantic shows that regions of important model-data disagreements in the <b>transient</b> <b>tracer</b> fields can also be readily identified in the T-S distributions. In the model, excessive vertical penetration of convective adjustment, leads to problematic production and outflow of the NADW, again appearing in both <b>transient</b> <b>tracer</b> and T-S fields. Sensitivities of the model fields are determined using the adjoint model. In the dual solutions, CFC- 11, CFC- 11 /CFC- 12 ratio age, and T - (β/α) S (β and α are thermal and haline expansion coefficients, respectively) exhibit the major ventilation pathways and the associated timescales, in the model. High sensitivity fields are candidates for providing the most powerful constraints in the corresponding inverse problems. Assimilation of both CFC and tritium data, with different input histories, sampling distributions, and radioactive decay constants, shows that by adjusting only initial-boundary conditions of CFCs and tritium, a 1 ⁰ x 1 ⁰ offline model and the <b>transient</b> <b>tracer</b> data can be brought into near-consistency, in the domain between 4. 5 ⁰S and 39. 5 ⁰N of the North Atlantic. Constraining a GCM with transient tracers is thus fully practical. (cont.)

Special focus lies on the eastern basin, where simulated concentrations of <b>transient</b> <b>tracers,</b> especially the chlorofluorocarbon CFC- 12, is compared with observations. The inner oceanic concentrations of these tracers provide a good means to identify pathways of newly ventilated water in the ocean and therefore allow to assess the model results. After 1987 the deep circulation in the eastern Mediterranean changed dramatically. The Adriatic was replaced by the Aegean as the main source of deep water. This process is simulated in the model via a decrease of sea surface temperature and an increase of sea surface salinity over the Aegean during winter. Realistic ventilation rates of the deeper parts of the Levantine and Ionian basin can be obtained by adjusting the rate of this extra buoyancy forcing. The resulting transient model circulation is compared with observational data and an explanation for the remarkable increase of salt content in the eastern basin of the Mediterranean is given. The concepts of age and age distributions are applied within the model for the old and new circulation state of the Mediterranean. Recently ventilated waters are characterized by young ages close to zero. During the spreading of the water into the ocean interior the ideal age increases, so it gives information on the circulation similar to those derived from <b>transient</b> <b>tracers.</b> The oldest water in the eastern Mediterranean is present in the Levantine basin, where upwelling of the deep water takes place, which reaches close to the surface.

Such repeat measurements can be directly compared without prior assumptions about mixing. A difference larger than similar to 2 years between modern sulfur hexafluoride and historical chlorofluorocarbon- 12 tracer ages implies a change in ventilation, although lack of difference does not necessarily imply no change.

Here we present <b>transient</b> <b>tracer</b> data from a field-campaign in April 2011 that sampled a unique suite of transient tracers (SF 6, CFC- 12, tritium and 3 He) in all major basins of the Mediterranean. We apply the Transit Time Distribution (TTD) model to the data which then constrain the mean age, the ratio of the advective/diffusive transport mechanism, and the presence, or not, of more than one significant (for ventilation) water mass. We find that {{the eastern part of the}} Eastern Mediterranean can be reasonable described with a one dimensional Inverse Gaussian (1 IG) TTD, and thus constrained with two independent tracers. The ventilation of the Ionian Sea and the Western Mediterranean can only be constrained by a multidimensional TTD.

The correlation between hydrographic and <b>transient</b> <b>tracer</b> data indicates that low temperatures in the deep water in the early 1950 s and between 1960 and 1980 reflect periods of higher deep water formation rates whereas periods of increasing temperatures in the late 1950 s and between 1980 and 1994 are related to low deep water formation rates. However, the <b>transient</b> <b>tracer</b> observations obtained in the 1980 s and early 1990 s indicate that even during periods of low deep water formation, some water from the upper water column contributed to deep water formation between 1980 and 1994.

40|$|Interior {{circulation}} pathways {{from the}} subtropics to the equator are markedly {{different in the}} Northern and Southern Hemispheres of the Pacific Ocean. In the North Pacific the pycnocline shoals and strengthens dra-matically under the intertropical convergence zone, separating the North Equatorial Current from the North Equatorial Countercurrent. While the high potential vorticity between these currents would intuitively seem to inhibit meridional water-property exchange between the subtopics and the equator, <b>transient</b> <b>tracer</b> analyses and some modeling studies have suggested an interior pathway from the subtropics to the equator in the pycnocline of the central North Pacific. This study delineates this pathway and estimates an upper bound for its magnitude at 5 (61) 3 109 kg s 21. In contrast, the southern branch of the South Equatorial Current clearly brings pycnocline water estimated at 15 (61) 3 109 kg s 21 from the southern subtropics directly to the equator in the South Pacific through an interior region of low and relatively uniform potential vorticity. In both hemispheres, these interior pathways extend downward {{as far as the}} lightest waters of the equatorial pycnostad. The subsurface counter-currents flanking the pycnostad form the equatorward limbs of tropical subsurface cyclonic gyres. These deep gyres are consistent with the absence of interior ventilation of the equator from the subtropics below the pycnocline.

A temperature maximum (Tmax) was established {{at the base of the}} upper layer (500 m) as a consequence of anomalously strong freshwater input into the near-surface layer at the beginning of the 1990 s. Tmax rapidly descended to 1500 m by 1995 followed by a much slower rate of descent. GSIW became warmer and less saline compared to the 1980 s. During the deepening phase of Tmax, atmospheric data revealed above-average wind stress curl and oceanic heat loss. In addition, high Arctic Ocean sea-ice export and lack of local sea-ice formation have been documented for that period. A combination of all these factors may have evoked the renewal of GSIW with anomalously freshwater from the upper layers. The Tmax layer established a stability maximum that inhibits vertical exchange between intermediate and deeper waters.

40|$|Current bioturbation {{models are}} marked by {{confusion}} in their treatment of porosity. Different equations appear to be needed for different biodiffusion mechanisms, i. e., interphase mixing, where biological activity causes bulk mixing of sediment affecting both tracer and porosity profiles, versus intraphase mixing, where the solid components are intermixed, but the porosity is left unchanged. Another issue is whether the model depends upon the particle type with which tracers are associated, e. g., 137 Cs on small clay particles versus 210 Pb on larger grains. This uncertainty has lead to conflicting conservation equations for radiotracers, and in particular, to the question whether the porosity should be placed inside or outside of the differential term that governs the biodiffusive flux. We have reexamined this situation {{in the context of}} multiphase, multicomponent continuum theory. Most importantly, we prove that under the assumption of steady-state porosity, there exists only one correct form of the steady-state conservation equation for a radiotracer, regardless of biodiffusion mechanism and particle type, i. e.,where x is depth, Cs is the concentration/activity of the tracer, Fseds is the constant flux of solid sediment to the sediment, ?s is the density of the solid phase, fs is the solid volume fraction, DB is the biodiffusion coefficient, and ? is the decay constant. This pertinent finding results from a substantial revision and extension of diagenetic theory. By considering the conservation of momentum, as well as mass, we have identified the correct reference velocities to define biodiffusional fluxes. From that, we have formulated a consistent set of model equations that govern (1) transient porosity and <b>transient</b> <b>tracer</b> concentrations, (2) steady-state porosity and <b>transient</b> <b>tracer</b> concentrations, and (3) steady-state porosity and steady-state tracer concentrations, in sediments that are subject to both compaction and bioturbation. ...|$|E

We found that an Inverse Gaussian distribution where {{the ratio of the}} moments δ and Γ equals 1. 2 is a possible solution (δ/Γ= 1. 2) of the TTD. The transient tracers further show considerable under-saturation in the mixed layer during the winter and spring cruises that can only be maintained by mixing or upwelling by tracer-poor water from below the mixed layer. We use dissipation data from microstructure measurements and the tracer depth distribution to quantify the flux of tracers to the mixed layer by vertical diffusivity and wind data from the ship to quantify the air-sea flux.

These observations have been attributed to "age-dependent" mixing. The present study employs a lattice-automaton model to investigate the short-term behavior of conservative <b>transient</b> <b>tracers.</b> Simulations demonstrate that despite constant, indiscriminate mixing of particles, mixing intensity, as quantified by the diffusion model, appears as a function of time due to the model being invalid on short time scales.

40|$|ArticleThe Southern Ocean is {{the most}} {{important}} area of anthropogenic carbon (Cant) uptake in the world ocean, only rivalled in importance by the North Atlantic Ocean. Significant variability on decadal time-scales in the uptake of Cant in the Southern Ocean has been observed and modelled, likely with consequences for the interior ocean storage of Cant in the region, and implications for the global carbon budget. Here we use eight cruises between 1973 and 2012 to assess decadal variability in Cant storage rates in the southeast Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. For this we employed the extended multiple linear regression (eMLR) method. We relate variability in DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) storage, which is assumed to equal anthropogenic carbon storage, to changes in ventilation as observed from repeat measurements of transient tracers. Within the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) layer, which is the dominant transport conduit for Cant into the interior ocean, moderate Cant storage rates were found without any clear temporal trend. In Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW), a less dense water mass found north of the Subantarctic Front and above AAIW, high storage rates of Cant were observed up to about 2005 but lower rates in more recent times. The <b>transient</b> <b>tracer</b> data suggest a significant speed-up of ventilation in the summer warmed upper part of AAIW between 1998 and 2012, which is consistent with the high storage rate of Cant. A shift of more northern Cant storage to more southern storage in near surface waters was detected in the early 2000 s. Beneath the AAIW the eMLR method as applied here did not detect significant storage of Cant. However, the presence of the <b>transient</b> <b>tracer</b> CFC- 12 all through the water column suggests that some Cant should be present, but at concentrations not reliably quantifiable.

The results are summarized in isopycnal distribution maps and propertyproperty plots. The layer between 800 and 1500 m is oxygen poor and nutrient rich and is poorly ventilated. Below this is a better aerated layer with the deep western boundary current, part of which separates along the equator. Regeneration of nutrients and consumption of oxygen persist into the deep ocean in regions off the west coast of Africa. The Mediterranean Outflow Water apparently is causing significant cross-isopycnal mixing through salt fingering. The resultant cross-isopycnal velocity may be large enough to cause significant vorticity stretching...|$|R
40|$|We compare {{alkalinity}} {{and total}} {{dissolved inorganic carbon}} (DIC) measurements made during the <b>Transient</b> <b>Tracers</b> in the Ocean, North Atlantic Study (TTO-NAS) in 1981 with modern measurements from a TTO reoccupation cruise in 2004 (M 60 / 5). We find that the TTO-NAS alkalinity values are 3. 6 ± 2. 3 µmol/kg higher than modern alkalinity data tied to Certified Reference Materials. The TTO-NAS DIC values re-calculated from original alkalinity and discrete-pCO 2 data using currently accepted constants are 3. 8 µmol/kg higher than those reported in the revised TTO data set. This difference is reduced to 0. 7 µmol/kg when our suggested correction to the TTO-NAS alkalinity is applied. These re-calculated DIC values are 2. 4 µmol/kg too low relative to contemporaneous measurements made by the vacuum extraction/manometric Certified method. Application of this correction brings the TTO data into almost perfect agreement with modern measurements for slowly-ventilated deep water of the eastern Atlantic...|$|R

[...] The entry of CFCs into the ocean makes them extremely useful as <b>transient</b> <b>tracers</b> to estimate rates and pathways of ocean circulation and mixing processes. However, due to production restrictions of CFCs in the 1980s, atmospheric concentrations of CFC-11 and CFC-12 has stopped increasing, and the CFC-11 to CFC-12 ratio in the atmosphere have been steadily decreasing, making water dating of water masses more problematic. Incidentally, production and release of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) have rapidly increased in the atmosphere since the 1970s. Similar to CFCs, SF6 is also an inert gas and is not affected by oceanic chemical or biological activities. Thus, using CFCs in concert with SF6 as a tracer resolves the water dating issues due to decreased CFC concentrations.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that Pb {{can be used as a}} <b>transient</b> <b>tracer</b> in the {{atmosphere}} and the ocean because of strong time-variability of industrial inputs and because Pb isotopic composition can be used to identify contributions from different sources. Pb isotopic measurements on aerosols collected from the North Atlantic Ocean in the trade wind belt are presented. Aerosols sampled at Barbados during the 1969 - 1985 period have a Pb isotopic composition different from that observed by previous investigators in Bermuda corals and Sargasso Sea waters. Barbados aerosols appear to contain significant amounts of relatively unradiogenic industrial and automotive Pb that is derived from Europe and carried to Barbados by the trade winds. In contrast, Bermuda corals and Sargasso sea waters are influenced mainly by U. S. -derived emissions, which contain more radiogenic Pb originating from Missouri-type ores. This difference generates a strong latitudinal Europe-U. S. A. isotopic gradient, thus allowing study of trans-Atlantic atmospheric transport and ocean mixing processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{interpretation}} of <b>transient</b> <b>tracer</b> observations depends on dif•cult {{to obtain information}} on the evolution in time of the tracer boundary conditions and interior distributions. Recent studies have attempted to circumvent this problem by making use of a derived quantity, age, based on the simultaneous distribution of two complementary tracers, such as tritium and its daughter, helium 3. The age is defined {{with reference to the}} surface such that the boundary condition takes on a constant value of zero. We use a two-dimensional model to explore the circumstances under which such a combination of conservation equations for two complementary tracers can lead to a cancellation of the time derivative terms. An interesting aspect of this approach is that mixing can serve as a source or sink of tracer based age. We define an idealized "ventilation age tracer " that is conservative with respect to mixing, and we explore how its behavior compares with that of the tracer-based ages over a range of advective and diffusive parameters. 1...|$|E
40|$|Representation of gaseous {{diffusion}} in variably saturated near-surface soils {{is becoming more}} common in land biogeochemical models, yet the formulations and numerical solution algorithms applied vary widely. We present three different but equivalent formulations of the dual-phase (gaseous and aqueous) tracer diffusion transport problem that is relevant to a wide class of volatile tracers in land biogeochemical models. Of these three formulations (i. e., the gas-primary, aqueous-primary, and bulk-tracer-based formulations), we contend that the gas-primary formulation is the most convenient for modeling tracer dynamics in biogeochemical models. We then provide finite volume approximation to the gas-primary equation and evaluate its accuracy against three analytical models: one for steady-state soil CO 2 dynamics, one for steady-state soil CH 4 dynamics, and one for <b>transient</b> <b>tracer</b> diffusion from a constant point source into two different sequentially aligned medias. All evaluations demonstrated good accuracy of the numerical approximation. We expect our result will standardize an efficient mechanistic numerical method for solving relatively simple, multi-phase, one-dimensional diffusion problems in land models...|$|E

The main parameter is the oxygen concentration that has been used together with temperature and salinity. Earlier it has been stated that the increase in temperature and salinity is due to the inflow of Arctic Ocean Deep Water in the form of Canadian Basin Deep Water and Eurasian Basin Deep Water, and reduced convection compensating for the increase of these parameters. Investigation of the oxygen concentration has provided another argument to support this theory where the decreasing trend in oxygen along with the increasing trend in temperature and salinity indicate the inflow of a warmer, more saline water mass of older age than the Greenland Sea Deep Water...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHere we {{describe}} GENIE-M, {{a new and}} improved version of the Grid ENabled Integrated Earth system model (GENIE), which is a 3 -D earth system model of intermediate complexity. Main development goals of GENIE-M were to: (1) bring oceanic uptake of anthropogenic <b>transient</b> <b>tracers</b> within data constraints; (2) increase vertical resolution in the upper ocean to better represent near-surface biogeochemical processes; (3) calibrate the deep ocean ventilation with observed abundance of radiocarbon. We achieved all these goals through a transparent process of calibration that mostly consisted of objective model optimization. An important new feature in GENIE-M that dramatically improved the uptake of CFC- 11 and anthropogenic carbon is the depth dependent vertical diffusivity in the ocean, which is spatially uniform in GENIE- 1. In GENIE-M, biological production occurs in the top two layers above the compensation depth of 100 m and is modified, for example, by diagnosed mixed layer depth. In contrast, production in GENIE- 1 occurs {{in a single layer}} with thickness of 175 m. These improvements make GENIE-M a well-calibrated model of intermediate complexity suitable for investigations of the global marine carbon cycle requiring long integration time...|$|R
