5|$|Accounts of snaring and {{destroying}} <b>the</b> <b>beast</b> are rare, {{as it is}} not {{generally considered to be}} a threat. In 1819 John MacCulloch, a noted geologist, described how inhabitants around the areas of Loch Awe and Loch Rannoch tried to capture a water bull by shackling a sheep to an oak tree as an enticement, but the tackle was not strong enough. Another story describes a farmer and his two sons hunting a water bull. The farmer's musket was filled with silver sixpence coins as <b>the</b> <b>beast</b> can only be killed with silver.|$|E

5|$|Director Bill Condon {{originally}} intended to include most songs from the Broadway musical adaptation of Beauty and <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> in the remake. However, Disney ultimately decided to recruit composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice to write entirely new songs for the film instead. Original Beauty and <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> composer Menken reunited with Rice, {{with whom he had}} previously collaborated on Disney's animated film Aladdin (1992), to write three new songs for the remake. Rice once again replaced original Beauty and <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> lyricist Howard Ashman, who had passed away shortly before the animated film's release in 1991, similar {{to the way in which}} he replaced the lyricist to aid Menken in writing new material for the 1994 stage adaptation. Menken believes that the songs he and Rice had written for the stage musical would not have translated well to the screen due to structural differences between the two formats.|$|E

5|$|Over a year {{passed before}} <b>The</b> <b>Beast</b> won another championship. In {{the summer of}} 1973, Sweetan was holding the ESA Tag Team Championship with Kurt von Steiger when <b>The</b> <b>Beast</b> teamed with Bobby Kay, {{the only one of}} his {{brothers}} with whom he had not held a tag team championship, and regained the trophy. Once again, however, Sweetan won the title back on July 31 along with partner Mr. X. During the ESA off-season, <b>The</b> <b>Beast</b> returned to Texas and reformed his tag team partnership with brother Leo Burke. In January 1974, the brothers defeated Don Fargo and Hank James to win the NWA Western States Tag Team Championship. Within two months, however, they lost the title to long-time rival Romero and his partner Dory Funk, Jr. Returning to the ESA, <b>The</b> <b>Beast</b> and Bobby Kay defeated Sweetan and Dubois to win the vacant Tag Team Championship. The reign lasted for less than one week before Sweetan and Dubois won the trophy in a rematch. The following month, <b>The</b> <b>Beast</b> had another short reign with the IWA North American Heavyweight Championship, winning the title and losing it back to Great Kuma in less than two weeks. He followed this with a victory for the Tag Team Championship with Burke on July 13, once again winning the title from Sweetan and Dubois.

5|$|Two months later, on April 4, <b>The</b> <b>Beast</b> {{teamed with}} Bull Ramos {{to win the}} NWA Western States Tag Team Championship by {{defeating}} Terry Funk and Romero.

They held the title until dropping it on August 3, 1971 to The Beast's former partner Freddie Sweetan and former rival Eric Pomeroy. <b>The</b> <b>Beast</b> had two more reigns with the ESA International Tag Team Championship that year, however. Four weeks after dropping it to Sweetan and Pomeroy, he regained the title from them {{with the help of}} his new partner Archie Gouldie, with whom <b>The</b> <b>Beast</b> had once feuded over the North American Heavyweight Championship.
