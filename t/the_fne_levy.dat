Although visual adaptation and plasticity have been extensively studied while participants are awake, little is known about what happens while they are asleep. It has been documented that sleep structure as measured by sleep stages using polysomnography is altered specifically in the first sleep session due to exposure to a new sleep environment, known as <b>the</b> first-night effect (<b>FNE).</b> However, <b>the</b> impact of <b>the</b> <b>FNE</b> on spontaneous oscillations in the visual system is poorly understood. How does <b>the</b> <b>FNE</b> affect <b>the</b> visual system during sleep? To address this question, the present study examined whether <b>the</b> <b>FNE</b> modifies <b>the</b> strength of slow-wave activity (SWA, 1 – 4 Hz) —the dominant spontaneous brain oscillation in slow-wave sleep—in the visual areas. We measured the strength of SWA originating in the visual areas during the first and the second sleep sessions. Magnetoencephalography, polysomnography, and magnetic resonance imaging were used to localize the source of SWA to the visual areas. The visual areas were objectively defined using retinotopic mapping and an automated anatomical parcellation technique. The results showed that the strength of SWA was reduced in the first sleep session in comparison to the second sleep session, especially during slow-wave sleep, in the ventral part of the visual areas. These results suggest that environmental novelty may affect the visual system through suppression of SWA. The impact of <b>the</b> <b>FNE</b> may not be negligible in vision research...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy, Health SciencesCarbohydrate (CHO) ingestion, {{especially}} a high glycemic index (GI) CHO meal can improve sleep in healthy individuals, but evidence is lacking regarding its efficacy {{to improve the}} poor sleep quality inherent in insomnia. The efficacy of a high GI meal to improve sleep lies in its capacity to increase the availability of tryptophan (TRP), the amino acid precursor to serotonin (5 HT), which is an intermediary product to melatonin, a primary neurohormone that influences sleep initiation. The addition of fat or protein to a CHO meal lowers the glycemic response. Thus, {{the effects of the}} GI of mixed macronutrient meals on sleep remain unknown. This thesis: (1) investigated the effects of a mixed macronutrient high GI (MHGI) and low GI (MLGI) meal compared to a carbohydrate only high GI (CHGI) meal on the postprandial availability of TRP to the brain, measured by it concentration relative to other large neutral amino acids (TRP/LNAA); and (2) evaluated the efficacy of a high GI mixed macronutrient meal to improve subjective sleep and objective sleep measures using polysomnography (PSG) in a group of men and women with insomnia.

A 55 -item multiple-choice survey was administered to the participants in a regular classroom hour. The survey consisted of five parts: Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE), Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS), Self-Rating Can-Do Scale (SR-CDS), Self-Rating for the Current Level of Study (SR-CL), Self-Rating Perception by the English (SR-EPE). The Pearson correlation coefficients and multiple regression analyses were run for the statistical interpretation of the data. To achieve valid and reliable results, 15 students were also randomly chosen to conduct an interview {{in order to find}} out their reasons for being anxious in using English.

40|$|The {{first night}} effect (FNE) has been {{described}} as a phenomenon that affects sleep quality as measured by objective parameters by polysomnography (PSG) tests that show decreased sleep efficiency, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, total sleep time and increased sleep latencies and REM latencies. Music therapy has been an effective tool in treating anxiety in a number of patient populations as well as helping patients improve sleep quality when measured by questionnaires administered pre and post intervention. It is hypothesized that music therapy may help alleviate <b>the</b> <b>FNE</b> by improving sleep quality and the current study investigates this music intervention by observing objective parameters through PSG. A total of ninety-eight subjects completed the study of determining effectiveness of intervention in a recently constructed sleep laboratory at Boston Medical Center.

Men and subjects that did not receive night-time respiratory treatments showed longer REM latencies when an intervention was involved. At this time, there is no reason to suggest that music therapy can help improve sleep quality on the first night in sleep laboratories when sleep quality is assessed using objective parameters.

Experiment one investigated conscious processing in high (n = 40) and low (n = 40) socially anxious participants. The results showed that the high socially anxious attended towards negative evaluation words (non-evaluative condition) and somatic sensation words (social-evaluative condition), compared to the low socially anxious. Experiment two explored pre-attentive and conscious attentional processing. A pre-attentional bias towards physical threat words was evident in the high socially anxious (n = 41), compared to the low socially anxious participants (n = 41), under social-evaluative conditions. There were no more significant findings. Experiment three investigated conscious attentional processing in generalised social phobics (n = 16) and low anxious controls (n = 16).

This dissertation focuses mainly on thyroid nodules that are {{commonly found in}} about 19 - 67 % {{of the population and}} 5 - 10 % of which are carcinoma. Currently the primary method of thyroid nodule diagnosis - Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC). FNAC has much room for improvement of diagnostic accuracy due to 15 - 32 % nondiagnostic results and 20 - 30 % indeterminate (suspicious) reports that lead for many complications for the patients. Furthermore, there is a wealth of variation of mechanical properties unique to different kinds of thyroid malignancies that are inaccessible with other existing methodologies. This dissertation introduces the novel concept of Fine Needle Elastography (<b>FNE)</b> and presents <b>the</b> design and development of a FNE Device prototype integrated with a FNAC needle that allows for quantitative and sensitive assessment of tissues and materials based on local variations in elastic, friction, and cutting forces on needle insertion. A piezoelectric force-sensor at the base of FNA needle measures the forces opposing needle penetration with the micrometer-scale resolution. The axial resolution (~ 20 &# 956;m) of FNE device was tested using control mm size gelatin matrices and unripe pear in assessing needle penetration resistance, force heterogeneity and optimization of needle penetration velocity. Further, it is demonstrated <b>the</b> usefulness of <b>FNE</b> in quantitative, biomechanical differentiation of simulated thyroid tumor nodules in an ultrasound neck phantom. Fluid or solid nodules were probed in the phantom study coupled with real-time ultrasound guidance. <b>The</b> preliminary <b>FNE</b> data shows significantly higher force and stiffness variations (1 -D Force Heterogeneity; HF,a= 6. 5 mN, HF,q= 8. 25 mN and Stiffness Heterogeneity; HS,a= 0. 0274 kN/m, HS,q= 0. 0395 kN/m) in solid nodules compared either to fluid nodules or to regions corresponding to simulated healthy thyroid tissue within the ultrasound phantom. Further investigation of the utility of the device in a proper clinical setting with excised thyroid tissue and in vivo testing of human subjects with different kinds of thyroid carcinoma can be used to develop a database of FNE data relating to each kind of thyroid nodule. The preliminary results suggest future applications of <b>the</b> <b>FNE</b> Device for in vivo FNE biopsies based on force and stiffness heterogeneity to diagnose thyroid nodules as an ancillary diagnostic tool in thyroid cancer management.

In Study 1, analysis of worry frequency ratings for the 116 negative outcomes revealed two major correlated factors corresponding to physical outcomes (harm or misfortune) and social outcomes (negative evaluation). These higher-order factors could be further subdivided into smaller discrete categories of related concerns. Ratings of worry frequency were higher for social outcomes. Trait anxiety was associated with both physical and social concerns, but stress and depression were primarily associated with social concerns. In Study 2, aversiveness ratings for the 116 negative outcomes followed the same physical-social organization and formed similar lower-order categories. Unlike the worry frequency ratings, aversiveness ratings were higher for physical than social categories, and did not correlate substantially with trait measures of depression, anxiety or stress.
