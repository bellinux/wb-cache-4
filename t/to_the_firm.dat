5|$|From {{the point}} of view of the {{domestic}} country, the subsidy is welfare improving. The 20 million subsidy is a transfer from the government <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> hence it has no effect on national welfare (ignoring costs of taxation; as long as these are not too large the basic insight of the model goes through). Additionally the domestic firm gains 50 million which would have otherwise gone to the foreign firm.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{the company}} {{was the subject of}} a {{decision}} in a lawsuit before the Illinois Supreme Court when a creditor argued that it was owed monies from the defendants after judgments were obtained against them. The court ruled against the creditor and in favor of the law firm, stating that the retainer owed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> took precedence. In Dowling v Chicago Options Associates, Inc, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that preemptive retainers used by attorneys were acceptable arrangements with clients.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> main {{challenge}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{estimation of}} the relationships of interest is that the enforcement measure is probably endogenous. To deal with this problem, I implement an instrumental variable strategy. The proposed instrument {{is a measure of}} the arrival cost of labor inspectors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>firms.</b> Labor inspectors travel by car from <b>the</b> inspection agencies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> <b>to</b> be inspected. A combination of the extension of the road network and the traffic in each province provides a measure of <b>the</b> arrival cost <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>firms.</b>|$|R

5|$|By the 1930s, the Boddington family {{shareholding}} had {{dwindled to}} around 40 per cent. On the 22 December 1940, the brewery water tanks {{were hit by}} bombs during the Manchester Blitz, and the brewery had to be closed down for several months, with production moved temporarily to the nearby Hydes Brewery. The brewery was rebuilt with the most up-to-date and modern equipment of the time, {{and was the first}} in Europe to install stainless steel brewing vats. In 1961, the brewer Whitbread took a 13 per cent stake in the company. In 1962 the company purchased Richard Clarke & Co of Reddish, Stockport, adding 60 public houses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1877 Beato sold most of {{his stock}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> Stillfried & Andersen, who then moved into his studio. In turn, Stillfried & Andersen sold the stock to Adolfo Farsari in 1885. Following the sale to Stillfried & Andersen, Beato {{apparently}} retired for some years from photography, concentrating on his parallel career as a financial speculator and trader. On 29 November 1884 he left Japan, ultimately landing in Port Said, Egypt. It was reported in a Japanese newspaper {{that he had lost}} all his money on the Yokohama silver exchange.|$|E
5|$|Gittings {{admitted}} that early meetings and writings in the Daughters of Bilitis urged their members not to upset mainstream heterosexual society; that integration and acceptance would be won if heterosexuals {{could see that}} gays and lesbians were not dramatically different from themselves. She worked in clerical positions during this time, spending ten years as a mimeograph operator for an architectural firm. The New York chapter of the DOB distributed a newsletter to about 150 people, and Gittings worked on it while being required to stay overtime at her job. In 1959, after using company envelopes to mail the newsletter out and covering the firm's name with a sticker, someone wrote <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> to notify them that a newsletter addressing lesbianism was being distributed. Gittings was sure {{that she would be}} fired, but her boss, a woman, stated cryptically that she was familiar with the topic, having served in the armed forces. She was not fired but cautioned to be more careful instead.|$|E

5|$|The Crow Green tannery was {{situated}} at the south-west end {{of the town and}} was already in existence in 1816. It had a water-powered bark mill and 47 tan pits at that date. It was owned by the Selwood family for much of the 19th and 20th centuries, who probably purchased it from James Whitby around 1830, and it was often referred to as Selwood's tannery. It suffered from fires in 1831, 1867 and 1958. In 1881 it employed 48 people and over 100 in 1958 (8% of the local workforce at the time). One of the major products of the factory in the nineteenth century was high-quality sole leather, but during the Second World War, only poor-quality hides, such as buffalo, were allocated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm.</b> The business was badly damaged by the invention of rubber stick-on shoe soles which reduced the demand for sole leather from shoe repairers. It finally finished operation in 1967 when the leather side of the business was sold to a Yorkshire firm.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model in}} which risk is admitted through random behavior of <b>the</b> <b>firm's</b> demand and cost functions. In a single period context the effects of monopoly power are analyzed with respect to optimal output and valuation of <b>the</b> <b>firm,</b> as well as relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm's</b> level of systematic risk as exhibited in its market return. In a multiperiod context the results are extended to an infinite horizon and a closed-form valuation expression is derived. Risk in <b>the</b> <b>firm's</b> future investment opportunities is shown <b>to</b> affect both <b>the</b> <b>firm's</b> valuation and changes in such valuation over time. The impact {{of this type of}} "growth" risk is directly linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm's</b> ability <b>to</b> obtain monopoly rents in its product market. ...|$|R
