5|$|Han-era astronomers {{adopted a}} geocentric {{model of the}} universe, theorizing that it was shaped like a sphere {{surrounding}} the earth in the center. They assumed that the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical and not disc-shaped. They also thought that the illumination of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>and</b> planets was caused by sunlight, that lunar eclipses occurred when the Earth obstructed sunlight falling onto <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> <b>and</b> that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon obstructed sunlight from reaching the Earth. Although others disagreed with his model, Wang Chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds.|$|E

50|$|In general, Uposatha is {{observed}} {{about once a}} week in Theravadin countries in accordance with the four lunar phases: <b>the</b> new <b>moon,</b> <b>the</b> full <b>moon,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two quarter <b>moons</b> in between.

5|$|Other {{proposals}} involved {{launching the}} Gemini spacecraft on a Titan IIIC, and refueling in low Earth orbit before proceeding to <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> <b>and</b> a single launch architecture using a three-stage {{variant of the}} Saturn IB.|$|E
5|$|After {{incubating}} {{for around}} 80 days, hatchlings dig through the sand to the surface, usually at night, when darkness increases {{the chance of}} escaping predation and damage from extreme sand surface temperatures is reduced. Hatchlings enter the ocean by navigating toward the brighter horizon created by the reflection of <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>and</b> starlight off the water's surface.|$|E
5|$|Cernan and Neil Armstrong {{testified before}} U.S. Congress in 2010 in {{opposition}} to the cancellation of the Constellation program.

50|$|Radiation belts at Uranus {{were found}} to be of an {{intensity}} similar to those at Saturn. The intensity of radiation within the belts is such that irradiation would quickly darken (within 100,000 years) any methane trapped in the icy surfaces of <b>the</b> inner <b>moons</b> <b>and</b> ring particles. This {{may have contributed to the}} darkened surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>moons</b> <b>and</b> ring particles, which are almost uniformly gray in color.|$|R

5|$|Direct Ascent: The {{spacecraft}} {{would be}} launched {{as a unit}} and travel directly to <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>and</b> land. It would return, leaving its landing stage on the Moon. This design would have required development of the extremely powerful Nova launch vehicle.|$|E
5|$|During the 18–19th centuries, {{the study}} of the three body problem by Euler, Clairaut, and D'Alembert led to more {{accurate}} predictions about the motions of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>and</b> planets. This work was further refined by Lagrange and Laplace, allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations.|$|E
5|$|Following the Babylonians, {{significant}} {{advances in}} astronomy {{were made in}} ancient Greece and the Hellenistic world. Greek astronomy is characterized from the start by seeking a rational, physical explanation for celestial phenomena. In the 3rd century BC, Aristarchus of Samos estimated the size and distance of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>and</b> Sun, {{and was the first}} to propose a heliocentric model of the solar system. In the 2nd century BC, Hipparchus discovered precession, calculated the size and distance of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>and</b> invented the earliest known astronomical devices such as the astrolabe. Hipparchus also created a comprehensive catalog of 1020 stars, and most of the constellations of the northern hemisphere derive from Greek astronomy. The Antikythera mechanism (c. 150–80 BC) was an early analog computer designed to calculate the location of the Sun, Moon, and planets for a given date. Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical clocks appeared in Europe.|$|E

5|$|In Aristotle's (384–322BC) {{description}} of the universe, the Moon marked {{the boundary between the}} spheres of the mutable elements (earth, water, air and fire), and the imperishable stars of aether, an influential philosophy that would dominate for centuries. However, in the , Seleucus of Seleucia correctly theorized that tides were due to the attraction of <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> <b>and</b> that their height depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun. In the same century, Aristarchus computed the size and distance of the Moon from Earth, obtaining a value of about twenty times the radius of Earth for the distance. These figures were greatly improved by Ptolemy (90–168AD): his values of a mean distance of 59times Earth's radius and a diameter of 0.292Earth diameters were close to the correct values of about 60 and 0.273 respectively. Archimedes (287–212 BC) designed a planetarium that could calculate the motions of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>and</b> other objects in the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|Once again, {{this is a}} simplification. Periodic {{motions of}} <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>and</b> {{apparent}} periodic motions of the Sun (actually of Earth in its orbit) cause short-term small-amplitude periodic oscillations of Earth's axis, and hence the celestial equator, known as nutation.|$|E

50|$|Also many {{cultures}} believe <b>the</b> sun <b>and</b> <b>moon</b> to be {{husband and wife}} or brother and sister. From the conception that <b>the</b> Sun <b>and</b> <b>Moon</b> were husband <b>and</b> wife many legends concerning them were created, chief among these being the old Persian belief that the stars were the children of <b>the</b> Sun <b>and</b> <b>Moon.</b> As common with many marriages it was also thought that <b>the</b> sun <b>and</b> <b>moons</b> marriage was an uneasy one. There are many legends of <b>the</b> sun <b>and</b> <b>moon</b> that relate their disputes and marital troubles, for mythology reveals that {{as husband and wife}} <b>the</b> Sun <b>and</b> <b>Moon</b> did not live happily together, some of these explaining the reason of seasons and weather. The myths and thoughts of the relationship between <b>the</b> sun <b>and</b> <b>moon</b> <b>and</b> their role in the universe are high in quantity.
