5|$|Russula emetica is <b>the</b> <b>type</b> {{species of}} the genus Russula.

A molecular analysis of European Russula species determined that R.emetica groups in a clade with R.raoultii, R.betularum, and R.nana; a later analysis confirmed the close phylogenetic relationship between R.emetica and the latter two Russulas.|$|E
