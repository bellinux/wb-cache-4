40|$|The damage {{tolerance}} of composite laminates can be significantly improved {{by the addition}} of through-the-thickness fibrous reinforcement such as stitching. However, there are numerous stitching parameters which can be independently varied, and their separate and combined effects on mechanical properties need to be determined. A statistically designed experiment (a 2 (sup 5 - 1) fractional factorial, also known as a Taguchi L 16 test matrix) used to evaluate five important parameters is described. The effects and interactions of <b>stitch</b> <b>thread</b> material, <b>stitch</b> <b>thread</b> strength, <b>stitch</b> row spacing and stitch pitch are examined for both thick (48 ply) and thin (16 ply) carbon/epoxy (AS 4 /E 905 L) composites.

Panel thickness was found not to be an important stitching parameter for tensile properties. Tensile modulus was unaffected by stitching...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} failure {{diagnosis}} {{has received a}} considerable attention {{in the domain of}} reliability engineering, process control and computer science. The increasing stringent requirement of quality of a product needs considerable attention in the performance and reliability of the manufacturing system. In general, the feedback control algorithm for a process designed to handle small perturbation that may arise under normal operating condition but can not accommodate any abnormal behavior due to fault. Thus the automated maintenance or early detection of worn equipment is becoming a critical issue. This justifies the need of development of effective methodology in the area of fault aware controller. In this paper we proposed a novel Algorithm and it have been tested and implemented for making Highly reliable system like Automated Cricket Ball <b>Stitching</b> <b>Machine.</b> Considering this need the present paper proposes the work on the development methodology of fault aware controller using embedded processor with reference to an early needle failure detection of a leather <b>stitching</b> <b>machine.</b> ...|$|R
