5|$|There was no {{established}} {{procedure for}} removing an English king. Adam Orleton, the Bishop of Hereford, {{made a series}} of public allegations about Edward's conduct as king, and in January 1327 a parliament convened at Westminster at which the question of Edward's future was raised; Edward refused to attend the gathering. Parliament, initially ambivalent, responded to the London crowds that called for Prince Edward to take the throne. On 12 January the leading barons and clergy agreed that Edward II should be removed and replaced by his son. The following day it was presented to an assembly of the barons, where it was argued that Edward's weak leadership and personal faults had led the kingdom into disaster, and that he was incompetent <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1258, Henry faced {{a revolt}} among the English barons. Anger had grown {{about the way}} the King's {{officials}} were raising funds, the influence of the Poitevins at court and his unpopular Sicilian policy; even the English Church had grievances over its treatment by the King. The Welsh were still in open revolt, and now allied themselves with Scotland. Henry was also critically short of money; although he still had some reserves of gold and silver, they were totally insufficient to cover his potential expenditures, including the campaign for Sicily and his debts to the Papacy. Critics suggested darkly that he had never really intended to join the crusades, and was simply intending to profit from the crusading tithes. To compound the situation, the harvests in England failed. Within Henry's court there was a strong feeling that the King would be unable <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> through these problems.|$|E

5|$|In 1258, King Henry III of England faced {{a revolt}} among the English barons. Anger had grown {{about the way}} the King's {{officials}} were raising funds, the influence of his Poitevin relatives at court and his unpopular Sicilian policy; even the English Church had grievances over its treatment by the King. Within Henry's court there was a strong feeling that the King would be unable <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> through these problems. On 30 April, Hugh Bigod marched into Westminster {{in the middle of the}} King's parliament, backed by his co-conspirators, including Simon de Montfort, the Earl of Leicester, and carried out a coup d'état. Henry, fearful that he was about to be arrested and imprisoned, agreed to abandon his policy of personal rule and instead govern through a council of 24 barons and churchmen, half chosen by the King and half by the barons.|$|E
25|$|After {{nine years}} in {{opposition}} and academia, Smuts returned as deputy prime minister in a 'grand coalition' government under J. B. M. Hertzog. When Hertzog advocated neutrality towards Nazi Germany in 1939, the coalition split and Hertzog’s motion to remain {{out of the war}} was defeated in Parliament by a vote of 80 to 67. Governor-General Sir Patrick Duncan refused Hertzog's request to dissolve parliament for a general election on the issue. Hertzog resigned and Duncan invited Smuts, Hertzog's coalition partner, to form a government and become prime minister {{for the second time in}} order <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> into World War II on the side of the Allies.|$|E
25|$|In 1996 Persson {{was chosen}} over Mona Sahlin, the Deputy Prime Minister, <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> after Carlsson retired. Persson began {{where he left}} off as finance {{minister}} - by continuing to spearhead government efforts to alleviate Sweden's chronic budget deficit. In 1994, the annual shortfall was about 13% of GDP. But, after implementing welfare cuts and tax increases, it fell to a projected 2.6% of GDP in 1997, which put Sweden {{in a position to}} qualify for the European economic and monetary union. However, the cost was high: unemployment rose, hovering persistently around 13%, then suddenly fell to about 6.5% the same year.|$|E

25|$|The {{case was}} met with a flood of {{nationalist}} and anti-Albanian statements in the Serbian press. This was, in itself, a significant development.

25|$|Revolutionary {{nationalism}} {{reflected the}} heritage and {{rhetoric of the}} military reformist regimes of the past, {{as well as the}} spirit of the 1952 Revolution. It also showed the influence of the Peruvian government of General Juan Velasco Alvarado. Many Bolivian officers believed that the military had to intervene in politics <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> toward reform because civilian governments had failed in that undertaking. They were convinced that it was in the main interest of the armed forces to end underdevelopment, which they saw as the cause of insurgency. The military would therefore fight on the internal frontiers against social injustice and economic dependence.|$|E

500|$|Following the Rhodesian Front's decisive May 1965 {{election}} victory, parliament {{was opened}} by the British-appointed Governor, Sir Humphrey Gibbs, on 9 June. For the first time, Rhodesia had an official Leader of the Opposition who was black: Josiah Gondo, {{leader of the}} United People's Party, now sat opposite Smith and the all-white RF in the House of Assembly. Though Gibbs represented the British Crown in Rhodesia, {{he had been a}} local resident most of his life, and had feet in both camps, regarding himself as loyal both to Rhodesia and to the faraway monarch. While opening parliament, he told the House of Assembly that the RF's strengthened majority amounted to [...] "a mandate <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> to its full independence"—later in the speech he referred to this as [...] "our independence".|$|E
500|$|Juan Manuel de Rosas's {{first term}} as {{governor}} lasted only three years. His rule, assisted by Juan Facundo Quiroga and Estanislao López, was respected {{and he was}} praised {{for his ability to}} maintain harmony between Buenos Aires and the rural areas. The country fell into disorder after Rosas's resignation in 1832, and in 1835 he was once again called <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> He ruled the country not as he did during his first term as governor, but as a dictator, forcing all citizens to support his Federalist regime. According to Nicolas Shumway, Rosas [...] "forced the citizens to wear the red Federalist insignia, and his picture appeared in all public places... Rosas's enemies, real and imagined, were increasingly imprisoned, tortured, murdered, or driven into exile by the mazorca, a band of spies and thugs supervised personally by Rosas. Publications were censored, and porteño newspapers became tedious apologizers for the regime".|$|E
500|$|The Baird {{nomination}} was emblematic of other difficulties Clinton had {{during the transition}} period and his early days in office, including most prominently the dropping of a promised middle-class tax cut and resistance to his proposal to allow gays in the military. [...] Stephanopoulos later wrote that [...] "We should have never let the Baird nomination get {{as far as it}} did, but our systems failed us at every crucial step." [...] And the timing of the announcement of the Wood withdrawal detracted attention from the signing of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the first legislative achievement of the Clinton administration. While a Gallup Poll showed that only 22percent of the public said that Clinton's difficulties in naming someone for Attorney General decreased their confidence in his ability <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> overall, Clinton experienced the highest disapproval ratings at the start of any presidency since such polling began.

5000|$|Woo Jang-choon (April 8, 1898 - August 10, 1959) was a Korean-Japanese {{agricultural}} scientist and botanist famous for breeding plants.

500|$|The Americans {{started to}} notice and become alarmed at {{increasing}} reports of political disillusionment {{in the military}} officer corps in August. An intelligence report prepared by the US State Department in late August claimed the [...] "worsening of internal security, the promotion of incompetent officers and Diệm's direct interference in army operations ... his political favoritism, inadequate delegation of authority, {{and the influence of}} the Can Lao". It also claimed that discontent with Diệm among high-ranking civil servants was at their highest point since the president had established in power, and that the bureaucrats wanted a change of leadership, through a coup if needed. It was said that Nhu and his wife were the most despised among the civil service. The report predicted that if a coup was to occur, the objective would probably be to force Nhu and his wife out of positions of power and allow Diệm to continue <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> with reduced power, should he be willing to do so.

500|$|The RF {{called a}} new general {{election}} for May 1965 and, campaigning on an election promise of independence, won all 50 [...] "A"-roll seats (the voters for which were mostly white). Josiah Gondo, {{leader of the}} United People's Party, became Rhodesia's first black Leader of the Opposition. Opening parliament on 9 June, Gibbs told the Legislative Assembly that the RF's strengthened majority amounted to [...] "a mandate <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> to its full independence", and announced that the new government had informed him of its intent to open its own diplomatic mission in Lisbon, separate from the British embassy there. The British and Rhodesians argued about this unilateral act by Salisbury, described by the historian JRT Wood as the [...] "veritable straw in the wind", alongside the independence issue until Portugal accepted the mission in late September, much to Britain's fury and Rhodesia's delight. Hoping to bring Smith to heel by stonewalling him, Wilson's ministers deliberately delayed and frustrated the Rhodesian government in negotiations. Rhodesia was again excluded from the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in 1965. The UK's refusal of aid, the Lisbon mission, the informal arms embargo and other issues combined with this to cause the Rhodesian government's sense of alienation from Britain and the Commonwealth to deepen. In his memoirs, Smith accused the British of [...] "resorting to politics of convenience and appeasement". Wilson, meanwhile, became exasperated {{by what he saw}} as Rhodesian inflexibility, describing the gap between the two governments as [...] "between different worlds and different centuries".|$|E
500|$|Factionalism {{within the}} PDPA made it ill {{prepared}} {{to handle the}} intensified counter-revolutionary activities in the country. Amin tried to win support for the communist government by depicting himself as a devout Muslim. Taraki and Amin blamed different countries for helping the counter-revolutionaries; Amin attacked the United Kingdom and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and played down American and Chinese involvement, while Taraki blamed American imperialism and Iran and Pakistan for supporting the uprising. Amin's criticism of the United Kingdom and the BBC fed on the traditional anti-British sentiments held by rural Afghans. In contrast to Taraki, [...] "Amin bent over backwards to avoid making hostile reference to", China, the United States or other foreign governments. Amin's cautious behavior was in deep contrast to the Soviet Union's official stance on the situation; it seemed, according to Beverley Male, that the Soviet leadership tried to force a confrontation between Afghanistan and its enemies. Amin also tried to appease the Shia communities by meeting with their leaders; despite this, {{a section of the}} Shia leadership called for the continuation of the resistance. Subsequently a revolt broke out in a Shia populated district in Kabul; this was the first sign of unrest in Kabul since the Saur Revolution. To add to the government's problems, Taraki's ability <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> was questioned – he was a heavy drinker and was not in good health. Amin on the other hand was characterised in this period by portrayals of strong self-discipline. In the summer of 1979 Amin began to disassociate himself from Taraki. On 27 June Amin {{became a member of the}} PDPA Politburo, the leading decision-making body in Afghanistan.|$|E
