5|$|After {{the club}} {{withheld}} payment to Swan, the PFA put an embargo on new manager Neil Warnock, though only after Swan began <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> training sessions did Warnock arrange {{a move to}} Second Division Burnley for £200,000. Swan stalled the move in anticipation for his missing wages from Plymouth, and continued <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> pre-season friendlies when Warnock called him up due to a developing injury crisis; eventually he negotiated a settlement of £25,000. Burnley manager Jimmy Mullen got the sack after a poor start to 1995–96, and his replacement Adrian Heath was appointed in March 1996.|$|E
5|$|From {{the middle}} of 1861, Định's Gò Công guerrillas focused on three objectives: <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> the newly created French bureaucracy, <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> their {{military}} outposts and <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> the transport of rice to Cholon, the main commercial hub of southern Vietnam. The first major attack against the French administration in the area targeted the Gò Công district office on June 22, 1861. At 05:00, 600 rebels {{under the command of}} Do Dinh Thoai stormed the military post in the town, engaging the French troops in hand-to-hand combat with lances, bayonets, knives and bamboo sticks. The French were surprised by the attack, losing one soldier and having 100 wounded. By the time reinforcements and naval cover had arrived from Mỹ Tho, Định's men had fled. Thoai—who had been the district chief until the French invasion—was among the 14 killed.|$|E

5|$|Huge urban roosts {{in cities}} can create {{problems}} {{due to the}} noise and mess made {{and the smell of}} the droppings. In 1949, so many birds landed on the clock hands of London's Big Ben that it stopped, leading to unsuccessful attempts <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> the roosts with netting, repellent chemical on the ledges and broadcasts of common starling alarm calls. An entire episode of The Goon Show in 1954 was a parody of the futile efforts <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> the large common starling roosts in central London.|$|E
5|$|The {{night before}} the start of the operations, the Soviet night bombers {{attacked}} the German divisional headquarters and artillery positions <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> the German command and control. The bombers also attacked German airfields and communication centres <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> the flow of reinforcements. Operation Iskra began at 9:30 on January 12, when the two Soviet fronts began their artillery preparation, which lasted for 2 hours 20 minutes on the western side and 1 hour 45 minutes on the eastern side of the bottleneck. The Soviet attack started five minutes before the artillery preparation finished with a Katyusha barrage, to fully exploit its effects.|$|E
5|$|Arranging a sleep {{environment}} that is quiet, very dark, and cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures have been shown <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> continuous sleep. Other recommendations that are frequently made, though less studied, include selecting comfortable mattresses, bedding, and pillows, and eliminating a visible bedroom clock, to prevent focusing on time passing when trying to fall asleep.|$|E
50|$|The role of {{the corpus}} callosum in {{epilepsy}} is the interhemispheric transmission of epileptiform discharges. These discharges are generally bilaterally synchronous in preoperative patients. In addition <b>to</b> <b>disrupting</b> this synchrony, corpus callosotomy decreases the frequency and amplitude of the epileptiform discharges, suggesting the transhemispheric facilitation of seizure mechanisms.|$|R

5|$|In February 1793, {{following}} years of rising tension, the French Republic that {{had emerged from}} the French Revolution declared war on the Kingdom of Great Britain. For the Royal Navy {{one of the most}} immediate concerns was to contain the French Atlantic Fleet based in the massively fortified harbour at Brest in Brittany. This port was ideally positioned <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> the merchant shipping convoys that passed through the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay en route to Britain from all over the world, and it was therefore imperative that the French fleet was not permitted to put to sea without being challenged. For the French, Brest was a vital port for the receipt of grain supplies from the Americas and so French fleets regularly sailed on missions to escort these convoys into the harbour and <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> British convoys entering the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|In July 1970, {{troops from}} the 196th Infantry Brigade reoccuppied Khâm Đức as part of Operation Elk Canyon I and II <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> North Vietnamese {{logistics}} system in Quảng Tín Province and forestall a VPA offensive in the autumn and winter.

50|$|One {{alternative}} <b>to</b> <b>disrupting</b> {{the harvest}} was to ravage the countryside by uprooting trees, burning houses and crops and killing all {{who were not}} safe behind {{the walls of the}} city. Ravaging the countryside cost much effort and was also dependent on the season because green crops do not burn as well as those nearer to harvest which are more dry.|$|R
50|$|Pressure {{differences}} occur {{outside the}} boundary layer of swimming organisms due <b>to</b> <b>disrupted</b> flow around the body. The difference on the up- and down-stream {{surfaces of the}} body is pressure drag, which creates a downstream force on the object. Frictional drag, on the other hand, is a result of fluid viscosity in the boundary layer. Higher turbulence causes greater frictional drag.|$|R
