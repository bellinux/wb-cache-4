50|$|The first switch may {{be allowed}} to spontaneously break down (sometimes called a self break) during {{charging}} if the absolute timing of the output pulse is unimportant. However, it is usually intentionally triggered once all the capacitors in the Marx bank have reached full charge, either by reducing the gap distance, by pulsing an additional trigger electrode (such as a <b>Trigatron),</b> by ionising {{the air in the}} gap using a pulsed laser, or by reducing the air pressure within the gap.|$|E
50|$|Glass <b>trigatrons</b> {{are often}} {{enclosed}} in a woven wire mesh, to provide protection from fragmentation if the device explodes due to internal overpressure.|$|R
50|$|<b>Trigatrons</b> {{find many}} {{different}} uses in pulsed power applications. For example, {{they were used}} in early radar modulators to feed the high-power pulses into the magnetrons, for use with slapper detonators, or for triggering a Marx generator.|$|R
50|$|Sprytrons {{are often}} {{designed}} similar to <b>trigatrons,</b> with the trigger electrode coaxial to the cathode. In one design the trigger electrode is formed as metallization {{on the inner}} surface of an alumina tube. The trigger pulse causes surface flashover, which liberates electrons and vaporized surface discharge material into the inter-electrode gap, which facilitates formation of a vacuum arc, closing the switch. The short switching time suggests electrons from the trigger discharge and the corresponding secondary electrons knocked from the anode as the initiation of the switching operation; the vaporized material travels too slowly through the gap to play significant role. The repeatability of the triggering can be improved by special coating of the surface between the trigger electrode and the cathode, and the jitter can be improved by doping the trigger substrate and modifying the trigger probe structures. Sprytrons can degrade in storage, by outgassing from their components, diffusion of gases (especially hydrogen) through the metal components, and gas leaks through the hermetic seals; an example tube manufactured with internal pressure of 0.001 Pa will exhibit spontaneous gap breakdowns when the pressure inside rises to 1 Pa. Accelerated testing of storage life {{can be done by}} storing in increased ambient pressure, optionally with added helium, for leak testing, and increased temperature storage (150 &deg;C) for outgassing testing. Sprytrons can be made miniaturized and rugged.|$|R
50|$|In {{magneto-optical}} shutters, {{the active}} material of the Faraday cell (e.g. dense flint glass, which reacts well to strong magnetic field) is located inside an electromagnet coil, formed by few loops of thick wire. The coil is powered through a pulse forming network, by a discharge of a high-voltage capacitor (e.g. 2 microfarads at 1000 volts), switched into the coil by a <b>trigatron</b> or a thyratron.In electro-optical shutters, the active material is a liquid, typically nitrobenzene, {{located in a}} cell between two electrodes. A brief impulse of high voltage is applied to rotate the polarization of the passing light.|$|E
50|$|A <b>trigatron</b> {{is a type}} of triggerable {{spark gap}} switch {{designed}} for high current and high voltage, (usually 10-100 kV and 20-100 kA, though devices in the mega-ampere range exist as well). It has very simple construction and in many cases is the lowest cost high energy switching option. It may operate in open air, it may be sealed, or it may be filled with a dielectric gas other than air or a liquid dielectric. The dielectric gas may be pressurized, or a liquid dielectric (e.g. mineral oil) may be substituted to further extend the operating voltage. Trigatrons may be rated for repeated use (over 10,000 switching cycles), or they may be single-shot, destroyed in a single use.|$|E
50|$|A <b>trigatron</b> {{has three}} {{electrodes}}. The heavy main electrodes {{are for the}} high current switching path, and a smaller third electrode serves as the trigger. During normal operation, the voltage between the main electrodes is somewhat lower than the breakdown voltage corresponding to their distance and the dielectric between them (usually air, argon-oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, or sulfur hexafluoride). To switch the device, a high voltage pulse is delivered to the triggering electrode. This ionizes the medium between it {{and one of the}} main electrodes, creating a spark which shortens the thickness of non-ionized medium between the electrodes. The triggering spark also generates ultraviolet light and free electrons in the main gap. These lead to the rapid electrical breakdown of the main gap, culminating in a low resistance electric arc between the main electrodes. The arc will continue to conduct until current flow drops sufficiently to extinguish it.|$|E
50|$|Special purpose, high-energy triggerable {{spark gaps}} {{can be used}} to rapidly switch high {{voltages}} and very high currents for certain pulsed power applications, such as pulsed lasers, railguns, fusion, ultrastrong pulsed magnetic field research, and in the triggering of nuclear bombs. Commercially available devices can be divided into two classes: positive pressure and triggered vacuum gaps. Positive pressure triggered gaps have a limited operating voltage range (for instance, from 1/3 to 2/3 of the self breakdown voltage). Triggered vacuum gaps offer a wide operating voltage range (400 V to 90 kV is achievable). Both classes can switch higher energy levels than any thyristor, thyratron, krytron, or sprytron. Triggered gaps are popular for single-shot and low-repetition-rate applications. One such switch is known as a <b>trigatron.</b> The Ignitron and Crossatron could be considered triggered gaps. The latter is unique in that it can be turned back off by the control electrode after conduction begins. The xenon flash tube is another common triggered gap. Various schemes have also been devised to trigger open air gaps on command. A set of spark gaps are a key element of a Marx generator, used to generate high-voltage impulses; the spark gaps allow a chain of capacitors to be slowly charged in parallel and then rapidly discharged in series.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} <b>trigatron</b> spark gap was {{described}} by J. D. Craggs, M. E. Haine, and J. M. Meek [J. Inst. Electr. Eng. 93 A, 963 (1946) ], there has been controversy about the physical mechanism responsible for triggering the devices. In this letter we present experimental evidence that directly shows the sequence of physical events responsible for triggering in the gap we studied, and we present a model for <b>trigatron</b> triggering based on this information. We believe this model to be general and discuss it in light of existing literature. We briefly discuss {{the implications of the}} model for the engineering design of <b>trigatron</b> gaps...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of breakdown voltage of a <b>trigatron</b> air-gap {{is related to}} the charge and energy of the triggering spark. Experiments were performed on a sphereplate <b>trigatron</b> spark-gap with the purpose of determining any direct dependence on lowering of breakdown voltage of either of the above characteristics. The experimental results have shown that the breakdown voltage reduces linearly as the triggering energy increases, irrespective of capacitor size or triggering voltage, and lead {{to the conclusion that the}} {{reduction of}} breakdown voltage depends directly on the energy of the triggering spark...|$|E
40|$|The <b>trigatron</b> {{has been}} in {{widespread}} use as a demand-triggered, high-voltage switch for more than 40 years. In spite of the popularity and maturity of the technology, there persists an uncertainty over the basic physical mechanism(s) responsible for triggering breakdown in the devices. We present {{the results of an}} empirical study of trigatrons that demonstrates that breakdown is initiated by a streamer launched from the trigger pin, independent of the trigger spark. We compare our results with those of previous workers, and discuss the generality of our conclusions...|$|E
40|$|The Nevada shocker is a 540 kV, 7 /spl Omega/, 50 ns {{pulsed power}} device based on Marx bank and Blumlein technologies. The Marx bank is {{composed}} of nine 60 kV capacitors charged in series with a gamma high voltage source connected by means of Ross relays in an air environment. A <b>trigatron</b> switch energized with an isolated mini capacitor bank is used to erect the Marx bank. The <b>trigatron</b> switch and erecting electrodes are contained in a gas manifold pressurized to 20 /spl plusmn/ 1 psi with dry air. The energy is released sequentially through an inductor and a water filled charging transmission line to the Blumlein immersed in deionized water. The Blumlein shapes and compresses the energy into a 50 ns pulse upon discharge. A self-breaking water switch initiates the release {{of energy in the}} Blumlein. The energy flows through a water filled discharging transmission line to the diode end of the Nevada Shocker. The current diode end of the Blumlein supports vacuum pressures as low as 6. 5 /spl times/ 10 /sup - 6 / Torr. The chamber is pumped {{with the aid of a}} roughing pump and a cryogenic vacuum pump. The vacuum section of the Nevada Shocker is currently being rebuilt to incorporate mechanical and thermal loading capabilities with sensors located at the experiment. A number of diagnostic developments are currently underway to support flashover studies on plastics. Resistive probe and differential B-dot diagnostics with the aid of a 6 GHz 20 GS/s TDS 6604 real time scope is documented demonstrating the capability of the machine...|$|E

The scheme of the accelerator includes the high-voltage transformer with resonant contours (Tesla transformer) charging the double forming line filled with the transformer oil and the high-voltage diode. The gas-filled <b>trigatron</b> spark gap with up to 10 atm operating pressure is used for the double forming line switching.

40|$|The system {{described}} {{here is a}} novel application of ferroelectric ceramics combined with a gas flow scheme that provides reliable triggering at high repetition rates. The design {{can be interpreted as}} an active trigatron-like switch, where the ferroelectric ceramic behaves as an electron/corona source and the trigger configuration is that of a simple <b>trigatron,</b> with the advantage that the trigger voltages are not as high as the gap voltage. The trigger system is integrated into a fast gas flow switch chamber design capable of sustaining 500 kV at a pressure of 1500 psig. The switch chamber is tailored to reduce field stresses and provide a low inductance current path with a very compact geometry. The high gas flow allows the replacement of the gas in the discharge region on a time scale necessary to sustain the required repetition rate (100 Hz to 1 kHz). The switch has been successfully operated during preliminary tests using N 2 at low pressure. The jitter was found to be less than 70 ps at a rep rate of 1 Hz. The rise time was on the order of 500 ps. Higher rep rates, faster rise times, and higher voltages will be attained as testing an...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To obtain {{experimentally}} {{that the}} duration of the high-voltage pulse front is less than 1. 5 nanoseconds on the load of a pulse voltage generator of less than 50 ohms in the form of more than two working chambers with a water-containing product. That increases the efficiency of disinfection of treated products. Methodology. To obtain high-voltage pulses in working chambers - the generator load - the pulse generation method was used according to the Arkadyev-Marx scheme. The pulses on the load were measured with a low-ohm resistive voltage divider, transmitted over a broadband coaxial cable, and recorded using a C 7 - 19 oscilloscope with a 5 GHz bandwidth. The working chambers were filled with water and consisted of an annular body made of PTFE 4 and metal electrodes forming the bottom and the chamber cover having flat linings of food stainless steel for contact with the food product inside the chamber. Results. The high-voltage pulses on the generator load of about 50 Ohm or less have a trapezoidal shape with a rounded apex and a base duration of no more than 80 ns. The experimentally obtained pulse amplitudes on the generator load are up to 18 kV. As the load resistance decreases, the amplitude of the pulses decreases, and {{the duration of}} the front and pulse duration in general are shortened because of the accelerated discharge of cascade capacitive storages. Originality. For the first time we have obtained experimentally on the load of the generator in the form of three parallel working chambers with water, the active resistance of each of which is less than 50 Ohm, the pulse front duration tf≈ 1 ns. In addition, we have obtained experimentally a stable 9 - 10 channel triggering mode of the <b>trigatron</b> type spark gap in a five-cascade pulse voltage generator with a step-by-step peaking (exacerbation) of the pulse front in its cascades (GPVCP). Practical value. We have obtained experimentally the nanosecond pulse front duration on the GPVCP load and that opens the prospect of industrial application of such generators for microbiologically disinfecting treatment (inactivation of microorganisms in food) water-containing food products...|$|E
