Knowing that Steve is monitoring the transport by helicopter, they get {{the car to the}} <b>target</b> <b>spot</b> and then create a diversion as they detonate explosives to drop the part of the road with the car into the old subway tunnels below. Stella cracks the safe, and they load up the Coopers with the gold. They race from the subway to the Los Angeles River and through the city, pursued by Steve's henchmen on motorcycles, with Napster helping to create a green wave to evade traffic. Steve himself eventually leaves his helicopter and steals a truck to follow them to Union Station.|$|E
25|$|In {{analysis}} of biological systems, Inorganic salts, {{which are also}} part of protein extracts, interfere with the ionization process. The salts can be removed by solid phase extraction or by washing the dried-droplet MALDI spots with cold water. Both methods can also remove other substances from the sample. The matrix-protein mixture is not homogenous because the polarity difference leads to a separation of the two substances during co-crystallization. The spot diameter of the target is much larger than that of the laser, which makes it necessary to make many laser shots at different places of the target, to get the statistical average of the substance concentration within the <b>target</b> <b>spot.</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{accurately}} {{control the}} pulse, a full {{characterization of the}} pulse spectral phase is a must {{in order to get}} certain pulse spectral phase (such as transform-limited). Then, a spatial light modulator can be used in the 4f plane to control the pulse. Multiphoton intrapulse interference phase scan (MIIPS) is a technique based on this concept. Through the phase scan of the spatial light modulator, MIIPS can not only characterize but also manipulate the ultrashort pulse to get the needed pulse shape at <b>target</b> <b>spot</b> (such as transform-limited pulse for optimized peak power, and other specific pulse shapes). If the pulse shaper is fully calibrated, this technique allows controlling the spectral phase of ultrashort pulses using a simple optical setup with no moving parts. However the accuracy of MIIPS is somewhat limited with respect to other techniques, such as frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG).|$|E

The first is a geotagged tweet, which demonstrates that the tweeter was indeed at the <b>target</b> <b>spot</b> at the time the tweet was posted.
