50|$|Originally {{an island}} {{that was used}} for agriculture, in 1928 Norsk Hydro decided to locate a new {{artificial}} fertilizer factory there, Hydro Porsgrunn, and in just 16 months both this factory and a shipping port for Norwegian saltpeter (calcium nitrate) were built. In the process, the narrow sound between the island and the mainland was mostly filled up, thus transforming the island to a peninsula. The reason Hydro wanted to establish itself in the Grenland region was the proximity to limestone, one of the necessary components in the fertilizer, Calcium nitrate. Norsk Hydro had previously had to build its fertilizer plants in Notodden (in 1907) and Rjukan (in 1909) because technology at that time didn't allow for efficient <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> long distances from the power plants {{to the place of}} use.

Service oriented architectures are heavily used to integrate heterogeneous systems. One key aspect of this integration is the use of a common language, such as the Common Information Model (CIM). Important use cases are exchange of topologies and storage of topology histories. This paper describes {{the development and implementation of}} CIM Topology Store (CTS). CTS introduces new difference models for CIM/XML-serialized topologies. 1 Interoperability in the energy utilities domain Various reasons result in a growing need for energy distribution companies to exchange data between them. One reason is the close coupling and the physical interdependencies between networks operated by different companies. Other reasons are challenges posed by new developments like the legal unbundling laws passed in 1998 by the EU.

Taking into account energy losses inherent in the transport, low overall efficiencies of around 33 % are obtained, meaning that about 67 % of the energy is lost as waste heat. In most modern power plants operating in combined cycles, efficiency values are about 52.5 % at the central outlet and approximately 48.5 % if it is {{taking into account the}} losses inherent in the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity,</b> which means that about 51.5 % of the primary energy continues to be lost to the environment as waste heat.|$|E
