40|$|Introduction: Transverse {{aberrant}} testicular maldescent is {{an extremely}} rare congenital anomaly characterized by the migration of one testicle towards the opposite inguinal canal. Mostly such cases are reported in children {{and they are very}} rarely seen in adults. Presentation of case: We report a case of a 24  year old male patient with left reducible indirect inguinal hernia with absence of testis in the right hemiscrotum. On surgical exploration, the patient had both the testicles on the left side. Left meshplasty with left orchidectomy for the atrophic ectopic testis was done. Discussion: It can either be associated with inguinal hernia, persistent Mullerian duct structures, hypospadias, <b>true</b> or pseudo <b>hermaphroditism</b> or other scrotal abnormalities. Usually treatment includes transeptal orchiopexy or extra peritoneal transposition of the testis. Conclusion: This rare anomaly is usually diagnosed incidentally during surgical exploration and carries importance due to risk of malignant transformation of the ectopic testis. Therefore it needs specific long term follow up after orchiopexy...|$|R

The 3 Primary Karyotypes for <b>True</b> <b>Hermaphroditism</b> are XX with genetic defects (55-70% of cases), XX/XY (20-30% of cases) & XY (5-15% of cases) with the remainder being a variety of other Chromosomal abnormalities and Mosaicisms.|$|E

The most common presentation of 45,X/46,XY karyotype is phenotypically normal male, next being genital ambiguity.|$|E

5000|$|The {{suggested}} solution {{put forth}} by ISNA was to restructure the system of intersex taxonomy and nomenclature to not include the words ‘hermaphrodite’, ‘hermaphroditism’, ‘sex reversal’, or other similar terms.

50|$|After {{her death}} a {{forensic}} test on body cells obtained from her clothing {{showed signs of}} a Y-chromosome in her DNA.

50|$|In the Vinaya Pali Canon, 4 gender {{types are}} defined: male, female, ubhatobyanjanaka and pandaka. ubhatobyanjanaka refers to {{intersex}} or literally {{a person with}} the signs of both sexes/genders.

Pandaka is a less clear cut case, all references have a central theme: some form of deficiency in male sexual reproductive capacity or reproductive desire. In traditional Hindu pre-scientific thought, all reproductive capacity (or burden) has been assigned to the sperm and lingam with no credit to the female or egg.|$|E
50|$|Pseudohermaphroditism, or pseudo-hermaphroditism, is a {{clinical}} {{term for the}} condition in which an organism is born with primary sex characteristics of one sex but develops the secondary sex characteristics that are different from what would be expected {{on the basis of}} the gonadal tissue (ovary or testis). It can be contrasted with the term <b>true</b> <b>hermaphroditism,</b> which described a condition where testicular and ovarian tissue were present in the same individual. This language has fallen out of favor due to misconceptions and pejorative connotations associated with the terms, and also a shift to nomenclature based on genetics.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{significant}} shift from publishing a regular journal titled Hermaphrodites with Attitude and demonstrating {{using the same}} name, the last stated goal of the organization was to eradicate what the organization deemed as [...] "misleading language". The ISNA claimed that nomenclature based on hermaphroditism was stigmatizing to intersex individuals, as well as potentially panic-inducing to parents of intersex children. The suggested solution put forth by the ISNA was to restructure the system of intersex taxonomy and nomenclature to not include the words ‘hermaphrodite’, ‘hermaphroditism’, ‘sex reversal’, or other similar terms.

50|$|Testes in {{androgen}} insensitivity are {{a special}} case: {{if there is}} any degree of responsiveness to testosterone, they should be removed before puberty. On the other hand, if androgen insensitivity is complete, the testes may be left to produce estradiol (via testosterone) to induce breast development, but there is a slowly increasing risk of cancer in adult life. Streak gonads without a Y chromosome cell line need not be removed but will not function. Finally, the gonads in <b>true</b> <b>hermaphroditism</b> must be directly examined; atypical gonads with Y line or potential testicular function should be removed but in rare instances a surgeon may try to preserve the ovarian part of an ovotestis. Potential surgical problems: A lifetime of hormone replacement will be required, to avoid osteoporosis and enable sexual functioning.|$|E
40|$|XX <b>true</b> <b>hermaphroditism,</b> {{also know}} as ovotesticular {{disorder}} of sexual development (DSD), is a disorder of gonadal development {{characterized by the}} presence of both ovarian and testicular tissue in a 46,XX individual. The genetic basis for XX <b>true</b> <b>hermaphroditism</b> and sex reversal syndromes unrelated to SRY translocation is still mostly unclear. We report mutational analysis of the RSPO 1 gene in a 46,XX woman with <b>true</b> <b>hermaphroditism,</b> palmoplantar keratoderma, congenital bilateral corneal opacities, onychodystrophy, and hearing impairment. R-spondin 1 {{is a member of the}} R-spondin protein family and its pivotal role in sex determination has been recently described. We identified a homozygous splice-donor-site mutation in the RSPO 1 gene in our patient. We found that the c. 286 + 1 G>A mutation led to an aberrantly spliced mRNA (r. 95 _ 286 del), which is presumably translated into a partially functional protein (p. Ile 32 _Ile 95 del). Our case demonstrates for the first time, to our knowledge, that XX <b>true</b> <b>hermaphroditism</b> can be caused by a single gene mutation. The reported findings represent a further step toward a complete understanding of the complex mechanisms leading to DSDs. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E

The results are consistent with double paternal and single maternal genetic contributions. Possible mechanisms that would explain these findings are discussed.
