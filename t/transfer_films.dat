40|$|Effects {{of water}} {{lubrication}} and applied {{load on the}} formation of PTFE <b>transfer</b> <b>films</b> and metal-F bonds during sliding when PTFE filled composites sliding against steel and Al 2 O 3 are investigated. In water lubricated conditions, XPS analysis reveals that {{a thin layer of}} water molecules at the sliding interface inhibits the formation of PTFE <b>transfer</b> <b>films</b> and Al-F bonds on the Al 2 O 3 ball, leading to a detrimental effect on the tribo-performance. Under various normal loads in dry sliding condition, it is found that the smearing of PTFE onto the wear surface of the composite and the transfer of PTFE onto the surface of the steel counterpart are stimulated by a high load. During sliding, the contact pressure is found to be the driving force of the reaction between steel and PTFE. It is concluded that under various loads, the total amount of PTFE <b>transfer</b> <b>films</b> has a larger impact on the friction behavior than the formation of Fe-F bonds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

Pin-on-disk sliding experiments were conducted with DLC coated disks and aluminum pins in hydrogen, nitrogen, and argon.

The low friction in hydrogen was brought about by the formation of <b>transfer</b> <b>films</b> with structured amorphous carbon, but no differences in the structure and contents of the films were found in the tests with and without trace water.

The <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> consists of reattached fine wear debris particles, the film, whenever formed, is strongly attached, enough to resist being wiped off by the slider. Calculations suggest that the fine particles are attached primarily by van der Waals forces {{and to a lesser}} extent by electrostatic attractive forces. As a consequence, the {{formation of}} <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> leads to a decrease in the wear rate because of the `protecting' role of the film.

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>transfer</b> <b>films</b> atop steel counterfaces {{in contact with}} unfilled and bronze-filled PTFE has been studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The sliding apparatus was contained within the vacuum of the analytical system, so {{the effects of the}} native oxide, hydrocarbon, and adsorbed gaseous surface layers of the steel upon the PTFE transfer behavior could be studied in situ. For both the filled and the unfilled PTFE, cleaner surfaces promoted greater amounts of transfer. Metal fluorides, which formed at the transfer film/counterface interface, were found solely in cases where the native oxide had been removed to expose the metallic surface prior to sliding. These fluorides also were found at clean metal/PTFE interfaces formed in the absence of frictional contact. A fraction of these fluorides resulted from irradiation damage inherent in XPS analysis. PTFE <b>transfer</b> <b>films</b> were found to build up with repeated sliding passes, by a process in which strands of transfer filled in the remaining counterface area. Under these reported test conditions, the transfer process is not expected to continue atop previously deposited <b>transfer</b> <b>films.</b> The bronze-filled composite generated greater amounts of transfer than the unfilled PTFE.

40|$|AbstractPolyetheretherketone (PEEK) {{polymers}} {{are increasingly}} used in tribological applications. An {{important aspect of}} PEEK tribology is the surface temperature reached during sliding. At present, most knowledge of frictional heating in PEEK is based on post-hoc analysis of debris and wear surfaces. In this study, infrared thermography was used to observe the full field temperature map of PEEK against sapphire counterface during ball-on-disc sliding. The measured temperatures matched closely those predicted by flash temperature models. Additionally, friction studies were performed with steel and sapphire counterfaces. It was observed that PEEK debris readily deposited on steel but not on sapphire. The friction studies also indicated a greater adhesive friction response for PEEK against steel compared to PEEK against sapphire. The transfer of PEEK material to the steel surface may elevate the temperature at the sliding interface. Analysis of <b>transfer</b> <b>films</b> on steel suggests that the transferred PEEK was oriented {{in the direction of}} sliding. The deposition of debris and formation of oriented films resembled a high temperature drawing process, which was likely to be due to localized frictional heating.

The worn surfaces and <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> on the coun-terface {{were analyzed by}} means of scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results show that, due to the wear of the OTS monolayer {{and the formation of}} the <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> on the counterpart ball, the friction coefficient gradually increases from 0. 06 to 0. 13 with increasing sliding cycles and then keeps stable at a normal load of 0. 5 N. The <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> is characterized by deposition, accumulation, and spalling at extended test duration. Though low friction coefficients of the monolayer in sliding against steel or ceramic counterfaces are recorded, poor load-carrying capacity and antiwear ability are also shown. Moreover, the monolayer itself or the corresponding <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> on the counterface fails to lubricate even at a normal load of 1. 0 N.

40|$|Influence {{of surface}} {{roughness}} on the friction of TiC/a-C nanocomposite coatings while sliding against bearing steel balls in humid air was examined by detailed {{analyses of the}} wear surfaces and the wear scar on the ball counterparts by atomic force microscopy, optical, and confocal microscopy. It was observed that the surface roughness of the coatings essentially determines the wear behavior of the ball counterpart, which consequently influences the <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> formation. A rough coating causes abrasive wear of the steel ball during the running-in period, which impedes {{the formation of a}} stable <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> and leads to higher values of coefficient of friction (CoF). Moreover, the CoF does not show a decreasing trend after the running-in period, although the roughness of the coating was greatly reduced. Replacing the worn ball with a new one after the running-in period yields lower CoF values similar to that observed for a smooth coating. In both of the cases, no wear of the steel ball occurs and a stable <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> forms and effectively covers the contact area. The influence of the wear debris on the formation of the <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> is also discussed. ...|$|R

Results showed that the COF is significantly depend on surface texture when compared to surface roughness (Ra) of the harder steel material. The <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> formation is found {{to depend on the}} COF. Detailed analysis of friction components, namely adhesion and hysteresis, demonstrated that the effect of surface texture on the COF and <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> formation was attributed to the variation of the hysteresis friction component.

Until now the characterization of <b>transfer</b> <b>films</b> in terms of their mechanical properties has been hampered by their nonhomogeneous distribution across a tested surface, their small size, low thickness and the difficulty in accurately positioning a test probe such that the film properties can be measured independently from those of the substrate.

In this study, mechanical and dry sliding wear properties of UHMWPE reinforced with different loading of talc particles were investigated. The wear test {{was carried out}} using Ducom TR- 20 pin-on-disc tester at different pressure velocity (pv) factors under dry sliding conditions. The worn surfaces and <b>transfer</b> <b>films</b> of pure UHMWPE and talc/UHMWPE composites were observed under scanning electron microscope (SEM). The experimental {{results showed that the}} microhardness increased with the increase of talc loadings in UHMWPE. The 20 wt. % talc/UHMWPE composites showed a 17 % increment in microhardness as compared with pure UHMWPE. The dry sliding wear behaviour of UHMWPE was also improved upon the reinforcement of talc. The wear rate of UHMWPE decreased after incorporation of talc particles. The coefficient of friction (COF) increased slightly under low pv conditions. At high pv conditions, the COF decreased in values with increasing talc loadings. The improvement in wear behaviour may be attributed to the increase in load-carrying capacity and surface hardness of the talc/UHMWPE composites. SEM micrographs on worn surfaces showed that plastic deformation and grooving wear were dominant for UHMWPE.

A correlation was established between the changes in <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> geometry and both the friction coefficient and the wear rate variations during a single stroke, {{as well as with}} sliding time. The role of wear products in running-in was found to be the determining factor. In order to avoid any unspecified influence of frictional heat variation on the sliding process, the counter specimen temperature was kept constant. Significant correlations, between both local and mean coefficients of friction and local and total areas of <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> respectively, were found. The latter relation shows the existence of two different types of running-in process which depend on whether, initially, adhesive or abrasive wear mechanisms prevail. In both cases, the building up of the <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> together with roll-like wear particles create several types of interactions between the rubbing bodies. These interactions, subsequently called subprocesses, have their own different specific coefficients of friction and can exist on the sliding track solely or in combination.
