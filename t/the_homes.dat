5|$|A {{historical}} plaque {{awarded to}} Avery {{indicates that it}} is the oldest house in Ledyard and states its date from 1720, but evidence suggests it to be older. This plaque was part of a statewide funded campaign by the State of Connecticut for the 350th anniversary of the state's founding. Disagreements over the program were widespread due to the difficulty in dating <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> by craftsmanship and the lack of documentation to prove it. Ledyard recognized the Avery Homestead because of the documentation possessed by Amos G. Avery.|$|E

5|$|As {{it moved}} ashore, Iris damaged houses and schools {{in dozens of}} villages. In 35villages, the storm {{destroyed}} more than 95% of the buildings. Its small size confined the worst damage largely to Toledo and Stann Creek districts, which are the two southernmost and poorest districts of the country. The percentage of damaged houses was 72% in Toledo district and about 50% in Stann Creek, leaving about 15,000people homeless. In both districts, the storm caused power outages and contaminated water supplies. In the worst-affected areas, poor Mayan people living on farms lost {{much of what they}} owned. At Placencia near the coast, about 80% of <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> were destroyed and many of the remaining buildings had roof damage, with downed power poles in the streets. About 90% of the houses in nearby Seine Bight were destroyed, and where Iris made landfall, over 90% of <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> were destroyed throughout Monkey River Town. The storm damaged several roads and fishing piers in southern Belize. Iris also damaged tourism facilities, including minor impact to the Maya ruins of Belize, and damaged 20% of the hotel rooms in the country, accounting for $37million in losses. The remainder of the country remained generally unaffected during the storm.|$|E

5|$|Damage was {{greatest}} {{in the southwest}} portion of the island, especially in the capital city, Roseau, which resembled an air raid target after the storm's passage. Strong winds from Hurricane David destroyed or damaged 80 percent of <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> (mostly wood)on the island, leaving 75 {{percent of the population}} homeless, with many others temporarily homeless in the immediate aftermath. In addition, the rainfall turned rivers into torrents, sweeping away everything in their path to the sea. Power lines were completely ripped out, causing the water system to stop as well.|$|E

5|$|During {{the years}} between World War I and World War II, {{many of the old}} mansions were hastily {{converted}} into apartments to house the growing labor supply, a practice encouraged by the federal government at the time through low-interest loans. However, after World War II, with the housing shortage solved by large-scale suburban development affordable to the middle class, vacancy rates in Old Louisville surged. To attract renters, landlords had to lower rents dramatically, attracting less affluent tenants with less funds to maintain <b>the</b> <b>homes.</b>|$|E

5|$|Many traditions have {{stressed}} the grief of mothers over deprivation {{of their children}} but little has been said historically about young children's loss of their mothers; {{this may have been}} because loss of the mother in infancy frequently meant death for a breast-fed infant.

5|$|Memorials to Ball in {{his native}} Nottingham include a {{monument}} and statue in the grounds of Nottingham Castle. The monument, which was commissioned by the city council and funded by public subscription, consists of a bronze group on a carved pedestal of Portland stone and granite.

The monument was unveiled on 8 September 1921 by Air Marshal Trenchard, with military honours including a flypast by a squadron of RAF aircraft.
