25|$|Although {{there is}} not any {{official}} definition {{of what constitutes a}} Cinderella team, <b>there</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be a consensus that such teams represent small schools, are usually low-seeded in the tournament, and achieves at least one unexpected win in the tournament. A recent example of this is Florida Gulf Coast University, a relatively new school that held its first classes in 1997 and became Division I postseason eligible in 2011. They made their first ever appearance in the 2013 tournament, winning two games to become the first ever #15 seed to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. The term was popularized as a result of City College of New York's successful run in the 1950 tournament.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be general {{agreement}} from most sources that this monastery {{was on a}} large site; with monastic dwelling houses located roughly around the site {{of what is now}} the Kirkgate carpark, the Trafalgar Masonic Lodge, South Leith Parish Church Halls and some of the Henderson Street tenements. A burial ground was located to the south of these structures extending towards Great Junction Street. This has been substantiated by the discovery of a burial site in this location during the laying of gas pipes in St Anthony Street. The site of the monastery reputedly extended down to Henderson Gardens and all along the street still known as Yardheads. It is thought that the street name 'Yardheads' may derive from the old Germanic stem, in which the word Yard means a garden or orchard. This would suggest the monastery had large gardens and orchards extending to this point. It is said that the monastery suffered great damage during the Siege of Leith in 1560. After the Scottish Reformation the monastery was allowed to languish; other buildings being gradually erected in its place and removing all physical traces of its existence. The Seal of the Preceptory of St Anthony (used to authenticate official paperwork of the hospital / monastery and dating from the mid-1500s) is held at the National Museum of Scotland.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008 Dr John Jackson of the Turin Shroud Center of Colorado {{proposed}} a new hypothesis – namely {{the possibility of}} more recent enrichment if carbon monoxide were to slowly interact with a fabric so as to deposit its enriched carbon into the fabric, interpenetrating into the fibrils {{that make up the}} cloth. Jackson proposed to test if this were actually possible. Professor Christopher Ramsey, the director of the Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, took the theory seriously and agreed to collaborate with Jackson in testing a series of linen samples that could determine if the case for the Shroud's authenticity should be re-opened. He told the BBC that [...] "With the radiocarbon measurements and with all of the other evidence which we have about the Shroud, <b>there</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be a conflict in the interpretation of the different evidence."

2500|$|The lyrical {{themes of}} death metal may invoke slasher film-stylised {{violence}}, {{but may also}} extend to topics like Satanism, religion, occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, philosophy, science fiction, and politics. Although violence may be explored in various other genres as well, death metal may elaborate {{on the details of}} extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. Sociologist Keith Kahn-Harris commented this apparent glamorisation of violence may be attributed to a [...] "fascination" [...] with the human body that all people share to some degree, a fascination which mixes desire and disgust. Heavy metal author Gavin Baddeley also stated <b>there</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be a connection between [...] "how acquainted one is with their own mortality" [...] and [...] "how much they crave images of death and violence" [...] via the media. Additionally, contributing artists to the genre often defend death metal as little more than an extreme form of art and entertainment, similar to horror films in the motion picture industry. This explanation has brought such musicians under fire from activists internationally, who claim that this is often lost on a large number of adolescents, who are left with the glamorisation of such violence without social context or awareness of why such imagery is stimulating.|$|E
