5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present {{in up to}} 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of the tear. Air can also be <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E

These synchrotron emissions were used to estimate the number and energy of the electrons around Jupiter and led to improved estimates of the magnetic moment and its tilt.|$|E
