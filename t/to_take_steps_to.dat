5|$|Testimony was {{presented}} that in October 2002, Mme M'Barek had convinced the peer {{that she was}} pregnant with his child, and as a result, Shaftesbury married her on 5 November 2002. Shaftesbury made out a new will leaving his new wife properties in Ireland and France. Two years later, with no child forthcoming, he began looking elsewhere for affection. When Shaftesbury initiated divorce proceedings, his wife feared losing her valuable inheritance and began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> secure her financial future.|$|E
5|$|Borobudur {{attracted}} {{attention in}} 1885, when Yzerman, the Chairman of the Archaeological Society in Yogyakarta, made a discovery about the hidden foot. Photographs that reveal reliefs on the hidden foot {{were made in}} 1890–1891. The discovery led the Dutch East Indies government <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> safeguard the monument. In 1900, the government set up a commission consisting of three officials to assess the monument: Brandes, an art historian, Theodoor van Erp, a Dutch army engineer officer, and Van de Kamer, a construction engineer from the Department of Public Works.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Iskandar and {{his family}} members were not prosecuted for their past {{violations}} of the law on grounds that the royal immunity was still applicable when the incidences occurred. Nevertheless, shortly after the incident, Sultan Iskandar was prompted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> rehabilitate his public image, which {{was more or less}} tarnished by the incident. In a public speech shortly after the episode, the Sultan was noted to have toned down somewhat on his hardline image and appeared to be somewhat more humble, appealing to Johoreans to maintain their loyalty to him.|$|E

5|$|After the Veterans' Mountain Camp {{was closed}} in the 1960s, the {{property}} was sold off to private owners, turning NY971D into {{little more than a}} private drive. Thus, the road saw little use, handling less than 10 vehicles per day on average. As a result, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) no longer considered the highway worthy of inclusion in the state highway system and began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> remove the highway from the system. On February22, 1999, NYSDOT sent a memorandum to the New York State Senate that laid out the groundwork for a bill which, if passed, would allow NYSDOT to remove NY971D from the state highway system once it was able to transfer ownership and maintenance of the highway to another entity. A bill based on the memo was introduced in the State Senate on March29 and eventually passed by the Senate and the New York State Assembly. The bill was signed into law by Governor George Pataki on July27, 1999. The former routing of NY971D is now officially a private drive.|$|E
5|$|The Minister can declare any fence or barrier {{surrounding}} {{a part of}} a security area to be a perimeter fence. The Commissioner of Police is permitted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> prevent people from crossing the fence or passing articles over, through or under the fence, including defensive measures that involve or may involve danger to life. If the measures are taken in a place other than on, under or within the perimeter fence, the Commissioner must take precautions – including displaying prominent warning signs – to ensure that people do not accidentally enter the area. If anyone is injured or dies {{as a result of a}} defensive measure, no compensation is payable unless the Minister certifies that it is just and equitable for such compensation to be paid. It is an offence to cross or attempt to cross, or pass or attempt to pass any article over, though or under a perimeter fence except at an authorized entry point; and to damage, attempt to damage or tamper with any fence or any gate or movable barrier at an entry point.|$|E
5|$|The Mortaras {{spent the}} morning of 24 June {{attempting}} to have Feletti's order overruled by either the city's cardinal legate, Giuseppe Milesi Pironi Ferretti, or the Archbishop of Bologna, Michele Viale-Prelà, but they found that neither was in the city. Around noon, the Mortaras decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> make the separation as painless as possible. Edgardo's siblings were taken to visit relatives while Marianna reluctantly agreed to spend the evening with the wife of Giuseppe Vitta, a Jewish family friend. Around 17:00 Momolo visited San Domenico to make one last plea to Feletti. The inquisitor repeated all he had said to Padovani and Moscato the previous night and told Momolo not to worry as Edgardo would be well cared for, {{under the protection of}} the Pope himself. He warned that it would benefit no-one to make a scene when the carabinieri returned that evening.|$|E

25|$|Promoting {{the concept}} of United States as a Judeo-Christian nation based upon Judeo-Christian ethics first became a {{political}} program in the 1940s, {{in response to the}} growth of anti-Semitism in America.

25|$|The Armenian {{leadership}} approved an ultimatum, {{presented to}} it by the Soviet plenipotentiary Boris Legran.

5000|$|Duty to {{mitigate}} - the aggrieved party {{has a duty}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> reasonable <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> mitigate damages. Failure <b>to</b> <b>take</b> such <b>steps</b> can cut off damages which arose from such a failure <b>to</b> <b>take</b> reasonable <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> mitigate. This is a duty of reasonable care thus no duty <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>steps</b> which are unreasonably burdensome. Example - buyer breaches contract to purchase produce; seller is expected {{to mitigate}} e.g., [...] "cover" [...] under the U.S. Uniform Commercial Code or resale; failure to make reasonable attempts to resell can be a ground to deny damages arising from breach e.g., spoilage. Breaching party is liable for costs which arise from an effort <b>to</b> <b>take</b> reasonable <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> mitigate. E.g., party continues to work after being notified of a breach and running up the bill. (however, this might be reasonable if the aggrieved party reasonably believed they had {{a better chance of}} selling a completed product to an alternative buyer).|$|R

25|$|Despite the {{agreement}} at Alinagar, neither side was {{content with the}} status quo. The British felt {{that if they did}} not assert their position, the French would become the dominant power in Bengal. Siraj ud-Daulah was fearful of being forced to accept British suzerainty. His position was weakened by his unpopularity with his own subjects, and the threat of other military enemies to the west. He began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> drive the British out of Bengal entirely.|$|E
25|$|As a result, {{a series}} of quick fixes {{followed}} to ensure that American forces would not be caught completely off guard {{in the event of}} war. More important was the sensitivity with which American officials now treated the nervousness of their European counterparts; the Americans now became more willing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> boost morale in Europe and ease the now-widespread anxieties there. The coup and the Berlin Blockade that June made clear that constant reassurance was needed to bind the Europeans to the U.S. system; hence, the remobilization of U.S. armed forces began.|$|E
25|$|In the USA, the Clean Air Act {{directs the}} EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for several pollutants, {{including}} ground-level ozone, and counties out {{of compliance with}} these standards are required <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> reduce their levels. In May 2008, under a court order, the EPA lowered its ozone standard from 80 nmol/mol to 75 nmol/mol. The move proved controversial, since the Agency's own scientists and advisory board had recommended lowering the standard to 60 nmol/mol. Many public health and environmental groups also supported the 60 nmol/mol standard, and the World Health Organization recommends 51 nmol/mol.|$|E
