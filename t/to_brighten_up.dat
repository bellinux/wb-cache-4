5|$|The {{campaign}} group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways held {{a celebration}} in 2009 {{to mark the}} increase in passenger numbers. They were joined by pupils from Parson Street Primary School who had provided artwork <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> <b>up</b> the station. This was done {{as part of the}} Severnside Schools Community Stations Programme, organised by the Severnside Community Rail Partnership. The Severnside CRP also installed plant displays in 2008, and in 2011 distributed leaflets advertising train services to local residents, in association with Bristol City Council and Passenger Focus. In January 2017 a group called Friends of Parson Street Railway Station was formed to lobby for improvements to facilities and services at the station.|$|E
5|$|At Tabata's suggestion, Naora {{expanded}} the color palette {{to increase the}} game's realism and tie in with XVs art style. The original idea was to change the original red hue to a golden one to match the redone logo, but the graphics looked too dark on the large screen even with the adjustment, so blue tones were added <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> <b>up</b> the scenery. Additional bass sounds {{were added to the}} sound effects, as the original platform's speaker system had previously limited the range and strength of sounds. The original camera behavior needed to be developed from scratch, as the camera angles used in the original looked out of place on the large screen. During the run-up to release, the team made modifications to the camera after receiving negative comments during demonstrations, addressing scenery collisions and the visibility of player and enemy characters during active gameplay. Because of these modifications, character speed and movement could be increased and improved. By December 2014, the game was in its final stages of development and undergoing debugging.|$|E
25|$|The {{residents}} of Samawah have used some simple and low-cost means <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> <b>up</b> {{the appearance of}} the grey concrete walls surrounding official buildings and schسكولion was started in the early 1970s, but was cut off during the period of Saddam Hussein's rule (1979–2003). The wall paintings put up since 2003 depict the new life achieved since the liberation.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{must try}} to make it pleasanter, dear. I'm going to get acquainted with Mr. Cragg and coax him <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> things <b>up</b> some, and buy you some new clothes, and take better care of you." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2011, Center Parcs began {{refurbishing}} {{all of its}} lodges. The beds {{were all}} replaced and new interiors introduced <b>to</b> help <b>brighten</b> <b>up</b> interiors. A new style 'Woodland Lodge' replaced the previous basic lodges to become the entry-level standard accommodation. Executive lodges were also upgraded.|$|R
25|$|Jewelry {{was also}} popular {{among those that}} could afford it. Necklaces were beaded gold or silver chains and worn in {{concentric}} circles reaching as far down as the waist. Ruffs also had a jewelry attachment such as glass beads, embroidery, gems, brooches or flowers. Belts were a surprising necessity: used either for fashion or more practical purposes. Lower classes wore them almost as tool belts with the upper classes using them as another place to add jewels and gems alike. Scarves, although not often mentioned, {{had a significant impact}} on the Elizabethan style by being a multipurpose piece of clothing. They could be worn on the head to protect desirable pale skin from the sun, warm the neck on a colder day, and accentuate the colour scheme of a gown or whole outfit. The upper class had silken scarves of every color <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> <b>up</b> an outfit with the gold thread and tassels hanging off of it.|$|E
500|$|As {{the group}} is {{backstage}} preparing for the Christmas pageant, Mr. Rad informs Abed of his long-term intentions for the group. As Abed had only made the group join <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> <b>up</b> Christmas, he sets forth upsetting Mr. Rad's plans. While the group performs [...] "Planet Christmas" [...] on stage, he asks Britta (who was originally cast as the mute tree) to replace him as the Mouse King. She does and ruins the pageant with her poor singing and bad, improvised lyrics and choreography.. Despite Mr. Rad's objections, Dean Pelton (Jim Rash) and the audience supportively agree to 'let Britta finish her awkward song' {{in the spirit of}} inclusion. However Mr. Rad then becomes enraged at the idea and inadvertently reveals that he caused the bus crash that killed the glee club members mentioned in [...] "Paradigms of Human Memory" [...] before distracting everyone and running off. Abed regretfully concedes that [...] "forcing things to be bright just makes the darkness underneath it even darker." ...|$|E
500|$|Passenger {{numbers at}} Clifton Down were further boosted by a {{marketing}} campaign by the Severnside Community Rail Partnership {{to attract more}} people, especially students, to use the station. The work won a Department for Transport Community Rail Marketing Award in 2007. The Severnside CRP also formed {{a support group for}} the station, and improved the provision of timetabling information through the use of simplified departure timetable posters. In 2009, they painted a large station sign on the road bridge over the line, and in 2010 they collaborated with Redland Green School to decorate the bricked-up windows and doors of the station building with animal artwork <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> <b>up</b> the station and promote Bristol Zoo. The work won a Community Rail Award. Customer help points with next train information screens were installed during 2008/09, paid for by money from the Department for Transport's [...] "Access for All" [...] fund and local councils. Ticket machines were installed in early 2011, following complaints that passengers were unable to pay their fares. The station building was again renamed in 2016, and is now the Steam Bristol beer hall and rotisserie.|$|E

500|$|Lost Horizons {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics, although several critics critiqued the album's near-constant mellowness. Stuart Mason of AllMusic called the album [...] "a delightful but slightly faceless blend of lounge pop, subtle beats, found sound, with mellow jazz influences." [...] A reviewer for Entertainment.ie praised the band for approaching electronica {{from a new}} angle, writing, [...] "this London-based duo employ Playschool pianos, acoustic guitars and sprightly beats to create laid-back instrumentals guaranteed to soothe even the most restless of souls. [...] What really marks Lemon Jelly as exciting new talents is their quirky sense of humour, which they use <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> <b>up</b> their sound with skilful use of nursery rhymes, brass bands and offbeat samples. Pascal Wyse of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Everything is approachable and purely crafted, but Lost Horizons cheats banality with some choice quirks: Magnificent Seven strings, astronauts chatting, panoramic sound effects." [...] Chris Dahlen of Pitchfork felt that the album {{was a little too}} saccharine at times, but that it is [...] "the perfect disc to throw on after your four-disc Ultrachill Dub Groove Mix has put the whole party to sleep. It's like eight flavors of ribbon candy, beach balls hitting the ground like hail, and a big plastic clown face that blows helium." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of the tower was empty after opening because most tenants had not moved in yet {{and there was a}} global recession. [...] <b>To</b> <b>brighten</b> <b>up</b> the tower, lights and lasers were installed during the Christmas celebrations of 1991.|$|E

60|$|Major Hill was {{in command}} of the {{detachment}} of Northwest Mounted Police at Dufferin Bluff. Mrs. Hill was wont to declare that it was the most forsaken place to be found in Canada or out of it; but she did her very best <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> it <b>up,</b> and it is only {{fair to say that the}} N.W.M.P., officers and men, seconded her efforts.|$|R

2500|$|Set number 4110 was {{delivered}} in April 2013 {{in a special}} Shibuya Hikarie body graphics and with modified interior to mark {{the first anniversary of}} Tokyu's [...] "Shibuya Hikarie" [...] development located above the newly expanded underground Shibuya Station. This trainset entered revenue service on 26 April 2013. It is the first 5050 series train to feature LED interior lighting, and has higher backed seating than regular trains, with grey seat backs in cars 1, 3, 8, and 10, brown seat backs in cars 2, 4, 6, and 9, and blue seat backs in cars 5 and 7.

2500|$|Describing the {{character}} in 2002, actress Kim Medcalf said, [...] "She’s {{always looking for}} something <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> <b>up</b> her day — to either play a trick on someone, or flirt with them, or just to cause a bit of mischief. Sam’s a colourful and fun character as she’s had such a past." [...] She added in 2003, [...] "She wears her heart on her sleeve. She so wants to settle down that she doesn't select men well. She goes for people too quickly. She likes the danger aspect — {{the thrill of the}} chase. She loves guys with a dangerous edge [...] She's had a tough upbringing. She didn't know her dad and her older brothers bossed her around. She needed to find herself and has done it by being independent and going away. She's headstrong and has a definite independent streak." [...] She has added that Sam has a problem with women, as she [...] "finds it quite hard to relate".|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{think she}} was looking quite so well as usual, when I first come in," [...] said Mrs. Peckover, patting the girl's cheek with her chubby fingers; [...] "but she seems <b>to</b> have <b>brightened</b> <b>up</b> again now." [...] (This was true: the sad stillness had left Madonna's face, at sight of the friend and mother of her early days.) [...] "Perhaps she's been {{sticking}} {{a little too close}} to her drawing lately--" ...|$|R

50|$|First {{patented}} by Elijah Galloway in 1843, kamptulicon was first launched in public at the 1862 International Exhibition in London, where it caused a sensation. Its promoters {{compared it to}} thick, soft leather, and lauded its ease of cleaning, water resistance, warmth, and sound-deadening qualities. Critics, however, pointed out that its grey-brown colour was unattractive. Attempts were made <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> it <b>up</b> by stencilling patterns on it with oil paint, but these suffered {{from a lack of}} durability.|$|R

50|$|Kiri Koshiba {{uses her}} hairstyling talents <b>to</b> help <b>brighten</b> <b>up</b> {{the lives of}} girls, but she does so anonymously. On the other hand, the Scissors Project (also known as the SP), {{a group of three}} boys at school, gives grand makeovers to already-beautiful handpicked girls. Shougo Narumi, the head of the group and a hairstyling genius in his own right, finds himself butting heads with Kiri. To make matters worse, Ochiai, another member of SP, plots to expose Kiri's talents. As much as Kiri tries to shy away from the spotlight, she finds herself drawn into the world of hairstyling.|$|R
5000|$|In his castle, Old King Cole [...] {{is having}} a long face for some reason. His {{personal}} jester tries <b>to</b> <b>brighten</b> him <b>up</b> but <b>to</b> no avail, and therefore leaves the throne room. Oswald then shows up and reads to him a book of comical rhymes. The rabbit's attempt helps a little and the king's mood improves slightly. Other entertainers (caricatures of film comedians Charlie Chaplin, Laurel & Hardy, The Marx Brothers and Jimmy Durante [...] ) also {{come in for a}} similar cause. Each of them has a distinctive method in providing comedy. It all comes down when some of them employs an act that involves hurling pies at each other. Eventually, everyone in the room joins the food fight, and so does the king who starts to enjoy it.|$|R
