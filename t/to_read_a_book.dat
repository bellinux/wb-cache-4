5|$|Although {{she writes}} under the pen name J. K. Rowling (pronounced rolling), her name, before her remarriage, was simply Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target {{audience}} of young boys might not want <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> written by a woman, her publishers asked that she use two initials rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother. She calls herself Jo. Following her remarriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence {{under the name of}} Joanne Kathleen Rowling and her entry in Who's Who lists her name also as Joanne Kathleen Rowling.|$|E

Technology evangelist Jon Udell admitted that, in his [...] "retreats" [...] from the Internet, he sometimes struggled to settle into [...] "books, particularly fiction, and particularly in printed form". He found portable long-form audio to be [...] "transformative", however, because he can easily achieve [...] "sustained attention", which makes him optimistic about the potential to [...] "reactivate ancient traditions, like oral storytelling, and rediscover their powerful neural effects".|$|E

[...] "On the other hand, there are words that may appear {{only one or two}} times in <b>an</b> entire <b>book.</b> Earth’s missing minerals are like these rare words; we haven’t found them yet because they formed only in very few places and in very small quantities.” ...|$|R

500|$|A {{second group}} {{surrounded}} PC Coombes, who sustained a five-inch-long cut to his face, and broken {{upper and lower}} jaws. In 2004 {{he said he was}} still suffering the effects of the attack, which the police regard as attempted murder, including poor hearing and eyesight, epileptic fits, and a memory so poor that he was left unable <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> or drive. A third constable, Michael Shepherd, had his protective helmet pierced by an iron spike. Several of the officers and firemen turned and ran back toward the crowd to try to save Blakelock and Coombes. Trevor Stratford told a reporter in 2010: [...] "I remember running in with another fire officer to get Dick Coombes. I literally slid into the group, like a rugby player charging into a ruck. We dragged him out, but he was in a hell of a state": ...|$|E
500|$|Scholastic Corporation {{bought the}} U.S. rights at the Bologna Book Fair in April 1997 for US$105,000, {{an unusually high}} sum for a children's book. They thought that a child would not want <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> with the word [...] "philosopher" [...] in the title and, after some discussion, the American edition was {{published}} in September 1998 under the title Rowling suggested, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Rowling claimed that she regretted this change and would have fought it {{if she had been}} in a stronger position at the time. Philip Nel has pointed out that the change lost the connection with alchemy, and the meaning of some other terms changed in translation, for example from [...] "crumpet" [...] to [...] "muffin". While Rowling accepted the change from both the British English [...] "mum" [...] and Seamus Finnigan's Irish variant [...] "mam" [...] to [...] "mom" [...] in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, she vetoed this change in the later books, which was then reversed in later editions of Philosopher's Stone. However, Nel considered that Scholastic's translations were considerably more sensitive than most of those imposed on British English books of the time, and that some other changes could be regarded as useful copyedits. Since the British editions of early titles in the series were published months prior to the American versions, some American readers became familiar with the British English versions due to buying them from online retailers.|$|E
500|$|In critiquing {{the rise}} of Internet-based computing, the {{philosophical}} {{question of whether or}} not a society can control technological progress was raised. At the online scientific magazine Edge, Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger argued that individual will was all that was necessary to maintain the cognitive capacity <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> all the way through, and computer scientist and writer Jaron Lanier rebuked the idea that technological progress is an [...] "autonomous process that will proceed in its chosen direction independently of us". Lanier echoed a view stated by American historian Lewis Mumford in his 1970 book The Pentagon of Power, in which Mumford suggested that the technological advances that shape a society could be controlled if the full might of a society's free will were employed. Lanier believed that technology was significantly hindered by the idea that [...] "there is only one axis of choice" [...] which is either pro- or anti- when it comes to technology adoption. Yet Carr had stated in The Big Switch that he believed an individual's personal choice toward a technology had little effect on technological progress. According to Carr, the view expressed by Mumford about technological progress was incorrect because it regarded technology solely as advances in science and engineering rather than as an influence on the costs of production and consumption. Economics were a more significant consideration in Carr's opinion because in a competitive marketplace the most efficient methods of providing an important resource will prevail. As technological advances shape society, an individual might be able to resist the effects but his lifestyle will [...] "always be lonely and in the end futile"; despite a few holdouts, technology will nevertheless shape economics which, in turn, will shape society.|$|E
50|$|Program {{execution}} {{might be}} likened <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> <b>a</b> <b>book.</b> While <b>a</b> person will normally read each word and line in sequence, they may at times jump {{back to an}} earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest. Similarly, a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program {{over and over again}} until some internal condition is met. This is called the flow of control within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention.|$|R
5000|$|The {{events of}} the week were mostly held {{during the day and}} hence {{primarily}} reached, or in some cases specifically targeted at, women, children and teachers. Indeed, it was generally accepted that women formed the bulk of the readership. Norman Lindsay, for example, wrote that [...] "My personal opinion is that the average woman reads much better stuff than the average man". In his Authors' Week talk, Frank Dalby Davison said that [...] "many people preferred yelling themselves hoarse at a test match or racecourse <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> by <b>a</b> cultured author".|$|R
5000|$|Another running gag {{involved}} Yoyo's ability <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>an</b> entire <b>book</b> {{by simply}} fanning its pages; his invariable comment after doing so was, [...] "Thanks for the book! I really enjoyed reading it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Muir {{was often}} {{invited to the}} Carrs' home; he shared Jeanne's love of plants. In 1864, he left Wisconsin to begin {{exploring}} the Canadian wilderness and, while there, began corresponding with her about his activities. [...] Carr wrote Muir in return and encouraged him in his explorations and writings, eventually having an important influence over his personal goals. At one point she asked Muir <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> she felt would influence his thinking, Lamartine's The Stonemason of Saint Point. It {{was the story of}} a man whose life she hoped would [...] "metabolize in Muir," [...] writes Gisel, and [...] "was a projection of the life she envisioned for him." [...] According to Gisel, the story was about a [...] "poor man with a pure heart," [...] who found in nature [...] "divine lessons and saw all of God's creatures interconnected." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Utah Territory was heavily {{populated}} by Mormons and dominated religiously and politically by the Mormon Church, which held great sway over Mormons voters. Because {{the vast majority}} of the population was Mormon, people outside of the LDS church had very little political representation. The segregation between Mormons and non-Mormons (at the time called [...] "Gentiles") became very apparent. As a non-Mormon woman there were few ways to meet other women, whereas, the women of the Mormon Church had the Relief Society to build friendships and expend energy. Froiseth struggled with the lack of social engagement. During a visit to family and friends back in New York City in 1875, Froiseth attended the Sorosis Women's club with her sister Julia. The experience Froiseth had at the club motivated her to form a literary club back in Salt Lake City which was organized in 1875 and called the Blue Tea. It was Utah's first women's club. The Blue Tea's first president was Froiseth (1876) who set a cap of 25 members. The Blue Tea discussed many topics for the purpose of stimulating [...] "mental culture" [...] within its members. A few women would be assigned <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> or article and come back the next week to expound on the ideas they read. Then the club would debate over those ideas. Froiseth described the Blue Tea's first year: [...] "we did good work, had some fine programmes, necessitating not a little reading and study, and the meetings went so well that there was rarely a vacant chair". Froiseth's club gave non-Mormon women the chance to socialize but also empowered them to push for change within their society. The minutes for the Blue Tea can be found in the Special Collections of the Marriott Library, ...|$|E

60|$|The {{study of}} books alone, is {{insufficient}} to give knowledge to the young. In the first stage, learning <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> is of no use whatever, without {{the voice of the}} living teacher. The child cannot take a step alone. As the pupil, however, advances in his course, his dependence upon his teacher for guidance and help, continually diminishes, until, at last, the scholar sits in his solitary study, with no companion but his books, and desiring, for a solution of every difficulty, nothing but a larger library. In schools, however, the pupils have made so little progress in this course, that they all need more or less of this oral assistance. Difficulties must be explained; questions must be answered; the path must be smoothed, and the way pointed out, by a guide, who has travelled it before, or it will be impossible for the pupil to go on. This is the part of our subject, which we now approach.|$|E
