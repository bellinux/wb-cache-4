5|$|According to Herodotus and Diodorus, the king, {{having taken}} {{the measure of}} the enemy, threw his best troops into a second assault the same day, the Immortals, an elite corps of 10,000 men. However, the Immortals fared no better than the Medes, and failed to make any headway against the Greeks. The Spartans {{apparently}} used a tactic of feigning retreat, and then <b>turning</b> <b>and</b> killing the enemy troops when they ran after them.|$|E
5|$|Insect ecology is the {{scientific}} study of how insects, individually or as a community, interact with the surrounding environment or ecosystem. Insects play {{one of the most important}} roles in their ecosystems, which includes many roles, such as soil <b>turning</b> <b>and</b> aeration, dung burial, pest control, pollination and wildlife nutrition. An example is the beetles, which are scavengers that feed on dead animals and fallen trees and thereby recycle biological materials into forms found useful by other organisms. These insects, and others, are responsible for much of the process by which topsoil is created.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} extratropical, Charley re-intensified under baroclinic instability. The resulting {{storm was}} a very large and fairly strong gale that gradually moved across the northern Atlantic Ocean. As an extratropical cyclone, Charley attained an atmospheric pressure of 980 mbar, which was lower than its pressure as a tropical cyclone. On August 24, it spawned a separate extratropical cyclone, which initially moved northeastward before <b>turning</b> <b>and</b> dissipating near Spain. The remnants of Charley accelerated as it approached the British Isles, and after passing south of Ireland it moved across Great Britain on August 27. While in the North Sea, the cyclone weakened as it executed a counter-clockwise loop, and on August 30 the remnants of Charley dissipated near Denmark as a new circulation developed to its southwest.|$|E

5|$|After forming, the {{depression}} moved slowly southeastward for about 24  hours {{before turning to}} the northeast, slowly organizing in the process. On September 10, {{the depression}} turned eastward, and later that day intensified into Tropical Storm Ginger, the seventh named storm {{of the year in}} the Atlantic, about 325 mi (525 km) south of Bermuda. The storm quickly intensified, and within 24 hours reached winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), making it a hurricane. It turned to the northeast, passing well to the east of Bermuda. Late on September 13, Ginger attained its minimum barometric pressure of 959 mbar (28.32 inHg), and early the next day reached peak maximum sustained winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). After reaching a position about halfway between Bermuda and the Azores, the hurricane's eastward movement halted due to a building ridge to its north and east. It turned sharply southward before <b>turning</b> <b>and</b> beginning a westerly drift, during which Ginger weakened to minimal hurricane status.|$|E
5|$|Fully aquatic mammals, the {{cetaceans}} and sirenians, {{have lost}} their legs and have a tail fin to propel themselves through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. Whales swim by moving their tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. Most species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from turning upside-down in the water. The flukes of sirenians are raised {{up and down in}} long strokes to move the animal forward, and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in <b>turning</b> <b>and</b> slowing.|$|E
5|$|Having {{failed to}} cut the French line at his first attempt, Howe reissued the order at 12:30. Once more Caesar was to lead the way, with the {{intention}} of splitting the enemy fleet in half. Captain Molloy then refused to carry out the order, signalling without cause that Caesar was unable to tack and then <b>turning</b> <b>and</b> sailing eastwards down the outside of the British fleet, rather than towards the enemy. This unexpected move threw the following ships into a state of confusion; Queen, coming behind Caesar, attempted to obey Howe's signal alone but was badly damaged by shot, and her captain John Hutt mortally wounded. Unable to effectively manoeuvre, Queen passed down the outside of the French line, firing as she went.|$|E

5|$|Players {{choose a}} course, a car, a {{transmission}} (automatic or six-speed manual), and a song. The cars {{vary in their}} specifications: some have a high top speed, others excel at acceleration or <b>turning,</b> <b>and</b> others present a balance. Certain cars are named after other Namco games such as Solvalou, Mappy, Bosconian, Nebulasray, and Xevious. The racetrack can be observed from the first-person perspective or, for the PlayStation version, from the third-person perspective. Namco's NeGcon controller {{can be used to}} play. Because the game is an arcade-style racing game, collisions do no damage, and merely slow the player down. There is a time limit, which ends the race if counted down to zero.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} Mk. XIV {{was first}} tested in June 1941. It {{was the first}} modern bombsight that allowed for accurate bombing immediately after radical manoeuvring, with a settling time as little as 10 seconds. The fast settling time was invaluable during night bombing missions, as it allowed the bomber to fly a corkscrew (a helical path), climbing and <b>turning</b> <b>and</b> then level out immediately before the drop. Even slow turns {{made it difficult for}} night fighters to track the bombers within the limited view of their radar systems and continually changing altitude was an effective way to avoid anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
5|$|Architecture {{during the}} Song period reached new heights of sophistication. Authors such as Yu Hao and Shen Kuo wrote books {{outlining}} {{the field of}} architectural layouts, craftsmanship, and structural engineering in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively. Shen Kuo preserved the written dialogues of Yu Hao when describing technical issues such as slanting struts built into pagoda towers for diagonal wind bracing. Shen Kuo also preserved Yu's specified dimensions and units of measurement for various building types. The architect Li Jie (1065–1110), who published the Yingzao Fashi ('Treatise on Architectural Methods') in 1103, greatly expanded upon the works of Yu Hao and compiled the standard building codes used by the central government agencies and by craftsmen throughout the empire. He addressed the standard methods of construction, design, and applications of moats and fortifications, stonework, greater woodwork, lesser woodwork, wood-carving, <b>turning</b> <b>and</b> drilling, sawing, bamboo work, tiling, wall building, painting and decoration, brickwork, glazed tile making, and provided proportions for mortar formulas in masonry. In his book, Li provided detailed and vivid illustrations of architectural components and cross-sections of buildings. These illustrations displayed various applications of corbel brackets, cantilever arms, mortise and tenon work of tie beams and cross beams, and diagrams showing the various building types of halls in graded sizes. He also outlined the standard units of measurement and standard dimensional measurements of all building components described and illustrated in his book.|$|E

5|$|Discus {{is one of}} {{the events}} where the athlete has to throw a heavy disc in the attempt to mark a farther {{distance}} than their competitors. As one of the events within the ancient pentathlon, the history of the discus throw dates back to 708 BC. In ancient times a heavy circular disc was thrown from a set standing position on a small pedestal, and it was this style that was revived for the 1896 Olympics. This continued until the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens, which featured both the ancient style and the increasingly popular modern style of <b>turning</b> <b>and</b> throwing. By the 1912 Olympics, the ancient standing throw style had fallen into disuse and contests starting within a 2.5m squared throwing area became the standard. The discus implement was standardised to 2kg (4.4pounds) in weight and 22cm (8inches) in diameter in 1907. The women's discus was among the first women's events on the Olympic programme, being introduced in 1928., although they had been competing at some national and regional levels previously.The first modern athlete to throw the discus while rotating the whole body was Czech athlete Frantisek Janda-Suk. He invented the technique when studying the position of the famous statue of Discobolus.|$|E
5|$|Pan frying (or shallow frying) {{requires}} {{a frying pan}} of sturdy construction {{and a source of}} fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces {{have been added to the}} hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often <b>turning</b> <b>and</b> even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Dujuan, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Onyok, was the strongest {{tropical}} cyclone to strike the Pearl River delta since Typhoon Hope in 1979. The 13th storm and 7th typhoon of the 2003 Pacific typhoon season, Dujuan developed on August27 {{to the east of}} Taiwan. It initially moved to the northwest, slowly intensifying into a tropical storm while drawing moisture and rainfall over the Philippines. On the island of Luzon, one person was killed and areas were flooded. Dujuan quickly intensified after <b>turning</b> <b>and</b> moving quicker to the west-northwest, developing an eye. It reached peak winds of 150km/h (90mph) on September1, and shortly thereafter passed just south of Taiwan. There, Dujuan left 590,000people without power, killed three, and caused NT$200million (NWD, $115million USD) in crop damage. While moving through the South China Sea, the typhoon developed concentric eyewalls. Dujuan weakened to severe tropical storm status before making landfall on September2 in southern China, just east of Hong Kong near Shenzhen, Guangdong. The storm dissipated the next day after causing 40deaths and ¥2.3billion (CNY, $277million USD) in damage. Most of the deaths were in Shenzhen where the storm moved ashore, and the city experienced a near-total power outage.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the 2012–13 season, May went {{on trial}} with League Two club Gillingham, {{training}} {{with the club}} {{for a number of}} weeks and playing in several pre-season friendlies. However, no move materialised, and May signed for Conference South side Dover Athletic on a free transfer on 8 August 2012. May made his competitive debut for Dover in a 2–2 away draw against Sutton United on 21 August 2012, coming on as an 86th-minute substitute. He made his first start four days later as Dover defeated AFC Hornchurch 1–0 at Hornchurch Stadium, before scoring his first goal for the club in a 3–1 away win at Eastleigh on 1 September. May went on to score in seven consecutive games running from September to November, five of which in the league and a further two in the FA Cup, subsequently taking his goal tally for the season to eight. Goals in convincing victories over Weston-super-Mare and Truro City took May's goal count into double figures. He ended the year with a run of five goals in three matches, scoring braces in wins against Eastleigh and Hayes & Yeading United, as well as scoring a late consolation strike in a 2–1 defeat to Tonbridge Angels on 26 December 2012. It took May a month to get off the mark {{at the start of the}} new year, controlling the ball and scoring on the turn in a 3–2 win over Welling United at the Crabble Athletic Ground on 9 February 2013. He scored four times in March 2013, subsequently taking his tally for the season to over 20 goals – the first time May had reached this milestone in his career. He scored two further times during the regular season, in away victories against Chelmsford City and Staines Town. Dover finished the season in third place, meaning they would play fourth placed Eastleigh in the two legged play-off semi-finals. May scored a dipping volley as Dover took a 3–1 lead in the first leg, controlling the ball on his chest with his back to goal, <b>turning</b> <b>and</b> hitting the ball from 25-yards past Ross Flitney in the Eastleigh goal. Dover progressed to the final, but lost 3–2 to Salisbury City after extra-time, with May playing in all three play-off matches. During his one season at Dover, May finished the season as the club's top goalscorer, scoring 24 times in 45 matches.|$|E
