25|$|Ray <b>transfer</b> <b>matrix</b> {{analysis}} (also {{known as}} ABCD matrix analysis) {{is a type}} of ray tracing technique used in the design of some optical systems, particularly lasers. It involves the construction of a ray <b>transfer</b> <b>matrix</b> which describes the optical system; tracing of a light path through the system can then be performed by multiplying this matrix with a vector representing the light ray. The same analysis is also used in accelerator physics to track particles through the magnet installations of a particle accelerator, see Beam optics.|$|E
500|$|Expressing the {{behaviour}} of {{a mechanical}} component as a two-port or multi-port with a <b>transfer</b> <b>matrix</b> {{is a useful}} thing to do because, like electrical circuits, the component can often be operated in reverse and its behaviour {{is dependent on the}} loads at the inputs and outputs. [...] For instance, a gear train is often characterised simply by its gear ratio, a SISO transfer function. [...] However, the gearbox output shaft can be driven round to turn the input shaft requiring a MIMO analysis.

[...] If, however, we attempt to use the circuit in reverse, driving it with a voltage at port 2 and calculate the resulting voltage at port 1 the expression gives completely the wrong result even with no load on port 1. [...] It predicts a greater voltage at port 1 than was applied at port 2, an impossibility with a purely resistive circuit like this one. [...] To correctly predict the behaviour of the circuit, the currents entering or leaving the ports must also be taken into account, which is what the <b>transfer</b> <b>matrix</b> does.

40|$|The fused six-vertex {{models with}} open {{boundary}} conditions are studied. The eigenvalues and the Bethe ansatz equations of the <b>transfer</b> <b>matrices</b> of the fused {{models have been}} given starting from Sklyanin's Bethe ansatz solutions.

For the case of the <b>transfer</b> <b>matrices</b> commuting with U_q[sl(2) ] the functional relations in braid limit close if q^h=- 1. This important property allows us to solve the functional relations. From the finite-size corrections of the fused <b>transfer</b> <b>matrices</b> we obtain the central charges and conformal weights of underlying conformal field theory. These conformal spectra are the same as those of the U_q[sl(2) ] invariant higher spin XXZ chains with open boundaries.

500|$|In {{control system}} theory, and various {{branches}} of engineering, a transfer function matrix, or just <b>transfer</b> <b>matrix</b> is a generalisation {{of the transfer}} functions of single-input single-output (SISO) systems to multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. [...] The matrix relates the outputs of the system to its inputs.

40|$|The fused six-vertex {{models with}} open {{boundary}} conditions are studied. The Bethe ansatz solution given by Sklyanin has been generalized to the <b>transfer</b> <b>matrices</b> of the fused models. We {{have shown that}} the eigenvalues of <b>transfer</b> <b>matrices</b> satisfy a group of functional relations, which are the su(2) fusion rule held by the <b>transfer</b> <b>matrices</b> of the fused models. The fused <b>transfer</b> <b>matrices</b> form a commuting family and also commute with the quantum group U_q[sl(2) ]. In the case of the parameter q^h=- 1 (h= 4, 5, [...] .) the functional relations in the limit of spectral parameter u→ı∞ are truncated. This shows that the su(2) fusion rule with finite level appears for the six vertex model with the open boundary conditions. We have solved the functional relations to obtain the finite-size corrections of the fused <b>transfer</b> <b>matrices</b> for low-lying excitations. From the corrections the central charges and conformal weights of underlying conformal field theory are extracted. To see different boundary conditions we also have studied the six-vertex model with a twisted boundary condition. Comment: Pages 29; revised versio...|$|R
500|$|In {{electrical}} systems it {{is often}} the case that the distinction between input and output variables is ambiguous. [...] They can be either, depending on circumstance and point of view. [...] In such cases the concept of port (a place where energy is transferred from one system to another) can be more useful than input and output. [...] It is customary to define two variables for each port (...) : the voltage across it (...) and the current entering it (...)

500|$|In some systems, {{especially}} ones consisting {{entirely of}} passive components, {{it can be}} ambiguous which variables are inputs and which are outputs. [...] In electrical engineering, a common scheme is to gather all the voltage variables {{on one side and}} all the current variables on the other regardless of which are inputs or outputs. [...] This results in all the elements of the <b>transfer</b> <b>matrix</b> being in units of impedance. [...] The concept of impedance (and hence impedance matrices) has been borrowed into other energy domains by analogy, especially mechanics and acoustics.|$|E
