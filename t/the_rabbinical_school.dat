25|$|Beginning in the 1970s, {{the topic}} of women's {{ordination}} was regularly discussed at JTS. Women who unsuccessfully sought admission to <b>the</b> <b>rabbinical</b> <b>school</b> during the 1970s included Susannah Heschel, daughter of JTS faculty member Abraham Joshua Heschel. There was a special commission appointed by the chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (Gerson D. Cohen) to study the issue of ordaining women as rabbis, which met between 1977 and 1978, and consisted of 11 men and three women; the women were Marian Siner Gordon, an attorney, Rivkah Harris, an Assyriologist, and Francine Klagsbrun, a writer. After years of discussion, the JTS faculty voted to ordain women as rabbis and as cantors in 1983. The first female rabbi to graduate from the school (and the first female Conservative Jewish rabbi in the world) was Amy Eilberg, who graduated and was ordained as a rabbi in 1985. The first class of female rabbis that was admitted to JTS in 1984 included Rabbi Naomi Levy, who later became a best-selling author and Nina Beth Cardin, who became an author and environmental activist. Erica Lippitz and Marla Rosenfeld Barugel were the first women ordained as cantors by JTS (and the first female Conservative Jewish cantors in the world.) They were both ordained in 1987.|$|E

5000|$|The teachers' institutes {{which were}} {{substituted}} for <b>the</b> <b>rabbinical</b> <b>schools</b> were, in <b>the</b> {{words of the}} Jewish Encyclopedia [...] "scarcely more satisfactory" [...] (The JE refers to the teachers' institute at Zhytomyr as [...] "probably the worst-managed Jewish institution in Russia of which there is any record," [...] citing Prelooker, Under the Czar and Queen Victoria, pp. 8-21, London, 1895).
