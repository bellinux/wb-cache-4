In 2002, she came in second, and later went fourth in 2003. She was second in both the 27th and 28th, and remained fourth in the 29th. In a Newtype poll, Cagalli was voted as the most popular female anime character from the 2000s. Cagalli was also the winner in a Sunrise poll that asked fans what female character from Gundam SEED and Gundam SEED Destiny would <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in swimsuit. She was also first in another that asked what female characters from the Gundam franchise would <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in a wedding dress. Two other polls from the same site asked fans what was the most memorable characters from Gundam SEED and from Gundam SEED Destiny; Cagalli was fourth in both of them.|$|E

In Donna Eder's study, Navajos were interviewed about storytelling practices that they have had in the past and what changes <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in the future. They notice that storytelling makes an impact on the lives of the children of the Navajos. According to some of the Navajos that were interviewed, storytelling is one of many main practices that teaches children the important principles to live a good life. In indigenous communities, stories are a way to pass knowledge on from generation to generation.|$|E
25|$|Self-enhancement {{suggests}} that optimistic predictions are satisfying {{and that it}} feels good to think that positive events will happen. People can control their anxiety and other negative emotions if they believe they are better off than others. People tend to focus on finding information that supports what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> happen, rather than what will happen to them. With regards to the optimistic bias, individuals will perceive events more favorably, because that is what they would like the outcome to be. This also {{suggests that}} people might lower their risks compared to others to make themselves look better than average: they are less at risk than others and therefore better.|$|E

However, as their plan moves through, things start to fall apart {{when they find out}} that Bill has no checkered past and nothing for them to use against him. Elise, feeling sorry for herself, gets drunk which only results in her and Brenda hurling vicious insults at each other, and the women drift apart. When Annie starts thinking about closing down the First Wives Club, her friends come back, saying that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> this to the end and Bill hasn't done anything blatantly wrong, but only as far as he knows. As a result, the wives manage to uncover information revealing that Bill's mistress (Elizabeth Berkley) is actually a minor.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{assumptions}} underlie their game theoretic model, {{and allow for}} the authors' simplified model of society. First, Acemoglu and Robinson assume that society is simply divided between a small rich class and a large poor class. Second, they assume that regimes must be either democratic or nondemocratic; {{there is nothing in}} between. Third, people's preferences in society are defined only by monetary redistribution from the rich ruling class. The more monetary benefits they get, the more they prefer the ruling class. Fourth, people care not only about redistribution today but also redistribution in the future. Therefore, people would not only want more redistribution today but also <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a guarantee for more or stable redistribution in the future. Fifth, the economic output of a country fluctuates year by year, which means revolution is less costly for the ruling class during economic downturn. Finally and most importantly, each individual in the society tries to maximize their own utility.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{announced}} by Fox in July 2013 to premiere {{in the fall}} of 2014. In May 2014, the network presented two clips from the episode at their annual upfront presentation. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly about the episode, MacFarlane stated that the key to a good crossover episode is [...] "really about the character interaction. People want to see Peter interact with Homer. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Bart interact with Stewie. In a way, the story in a crossover episode, while it has to be there, is never quite as important as how the characters interact with each other." [...] The Simpsons creator Groening added, [...] "In this case, it's two really vivid shows and seeing what they can do together. You want to see them having a good time and you want to see Peter and Homer duke it out".|$|E
500|$|... "Immortality" [...] was {{watched by}} about 3.7 million viewers, drawing a 1.4/4 ratings share on its initial broadcast, down 12.5 {{percent from the}} {{previous}} episode's viewership. During the first half hour, the episode placed second in its timeslot, but dropped to fourth for its second half. Its lead-in, Kitchen Nightmares, also dropped 12 percent, as did all other network shows for that night. Time shifting viewing added 57 percent to the episode's ratings for three days out, and 64 percent for a week following the first airing. This was the greatest DVR gain yet for the series in that timeslot. Despite this, Joshua Jackson urged fans to watch the series live {{in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly a week after [...] "Immortality" [...] aired. He explained [...] "I'm a positive person in general, but we really need our Fringe fans to tune in and watch us on Fridays.

500|$|The opening {{sequence}} of the episode was meant to replicate the same idea of season 2's premiere [...] "Man of Science, Man of Faith", where {{what seems to be}} a flashback is instead set on a new part of the island. Director Jack Bender questioned what Jack's goal was when he pulled on the chain, but Lindelof told him not to worry, because [...] "Fox will sell it, and he did". Lindelof described when Jack attacks his father at the AA meeting as [...] "pot-committed... it basically means you put so much money on the bluff, you can't fold your cards". The scene with Kate in a dress was inspired by Raiders of the Lost Ark, where Belloq gives a dress for Marion Ravenwood to wear, and was intended to make [...] "tom-boyish" [...] Kate feel vulnerable. The title, inspired by Charles Dickens' eponymous novel, refers to the reveal of another [...] "city" [...] on the island with the place where the Others live, in addition to the castaways' beach camp. The episode has only three characters of the second season's main cast, Jack, Kate and Sawyer. Lindelof later described this limited scope as [...] "a mistake, when the audience is away from the show for that long, <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> everybody", causing the following season openers to have scenes with most of the main characters.|$|E
500|$|Without {{more direct}} {{interaction}} on the curation process, allowing hundreds more {{games on the}} service, Valve had looked to find methods to allow players to find games {{they would be more}} likely to buy based on previous purchase patterns. [...] The September 2014 [...] "Discovery Update" [...] added tools that would allow existing Steam users to be curators for game recommendations, and sorting functions that presented more popular titles and recommended titles specific to the user, as to allow more games to be introduced on Steam without the need of Steam Greenlight, while providing some means to highlight user-recommended games. This Discovery update was considered successful by Valve, as they reported in March 2015 in seeing increased use of the Steam Storefront and an increase in 18% of sales by revenue from just prior to the update. A second Discovery update was released November 2016, giving users more control over what titles <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> or ignore within the Steam Store, alongside tools for developers and publishers to better customize and present their game within these new users preferences. By February 2017, Valve reported that with the second Discovery update, the number of games shown to users via the store's front page increased by 42%, with more conversions into sales from that viewership. In 2016, more games are meeting a rough metric of success defined by Valve as selling more than $200,000 in revenues in its first 90 days of release.|$|E

[...] Speaking before the UN General Assembly in New York on 24 September 2009, Netanyahu expressed a different opinion than Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's speech at the forum, saying those who believe Tehran is a threat only to Israel are wrong. [...] "The Iranian regime", he said, [...] "is motivated by fanaticism... <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> us go back to medieval times.
