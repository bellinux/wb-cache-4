500|$|Speaking of {{the album}} cover, Ranaldo said: [...] "in some ways the whole album started with the cover photo, and I kind of built it up from there. A young Canadian {{photographer}} took that photo of me in September 2010 during an interview session about legendary Canadian group The Nihilist Spasm Band. When I saw the photo I thought it looked so much like a cool album cover. At that point I only had three or four acoustic demos going, and it remained in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> that if I ever made enough songs for an album, I’d use that pic as the cover. So that helped push me to develop the songs." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 1, 1951, Feller {{recorded}} his third career no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers. [...] "I was depending on my slider and I didn't {{begin to think}} of a no-hitter until about the seventh inning. I tried to keep it in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> bearing down and concentrating on one hitter at a time", Feller said. Feller was the third pitcher, after Larry Corcoran and Cy Young, to record three career no-hitters. He became the first pitcher of the 1951 season to reach 20 wins after he pitched a shutout against the Washington Senators on August 21. Along with Early Wynn and Mike Garcia, Feller reached the 20-win mark during the season; they were the first trio of pitchers on the same staff to earn 20 wins since 1931. Feller was named the Sporting News Pitcher of the Year.|$|E
500|$|The Atlanta Braves' Marquis Grissom and slugger David Justice {{were part}} of a Braves roster that, heading into the 1997 season, was the MLB's highest-paid. Grissom ($4.8 million annual salary) and Justice ($6 million) were traded to the Indians in return for Lofton ($4.75 million) and Alan Embree ($206,000). [...] "This is a trade of {{enormous}} magnitude for two very, very good franchises. We're talking about franchise-type players", Hart said. For Lofton, considered [...] "the centerpiece of the Indians' 1990s revival", it was a return to the National League. [...] "The trade will be in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> for a long time, but it's baseball. It happens to nearly everybody. I'm [...] to play every day. It's all Braves from now on", Lofton said. By April 19, the Braves were 133 and Lofton's hitting (.453 batting average) had won favor with his new Braves teammates. [...] "If he keeps hitting [...]400 he'll fit in just fine", said Chipper Jones. For the season Lofton's [...]333 batting average and 27 stolen bases were team-highs (his stolen base total was to that point a career-low). He was caught stealing 20 times, an MLB-high. Atlanta won the National League East division with a MLB-best 10161 record. The Braves swept the Houston Astros in the 1997 National League Division Series (NLDS), three games to none. In the 1997 National League Championship Series (NLCS), the Braves lost to the Florida Marlins, four games to two (the Marlins later defeated the Cleveland Indians in the World Series). For the NLCS, Lofton batted [...]185 and was one of three Braves' players who recorded seven strikeouts in the series. For Lofton, who was eligible for free agency {{at the end of the}} season, it was his only season spent with the Braves.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the remix of [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] {{was directed by}} Carey's husband, Nick Cannon. Minaj spoke about filming a video with Carey and how she {{did not believe that}} the video would ever be released: [...] "I didn’t even tell anyone I shot a video with Mariah, because I didn’t even believe. In <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> I felt like, ’This video is not gonna come out. There’s no way I’m gonna do a video with Mariah Carey before I even put out my album.’ Then, when it came out, I think it was the #1 video on YouTube in one day, something crazy like that." [...] It premiered simultaneously with the video for [...] "Angels Cry" [...] with Ne-Yo on Vevo on January 28, 2010. Carey and Minaj play different characters, include Barbie dolls who escape from their boxes, sexy nurses in matching outfits, two women in a nail salon and two divas shopping. Carey's doll box has [...] "She sings" [...] written on the front, while Minaj's say [...] "She raps". Cannon makes a cameo appearance in the video, which Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy thought was a reference to the 2002 film, Drumline. According to Anna Pickard of The Guardian, the escape from their packaging demonstrates a theme of being independent women and {{that they will not be}} restrained by men. Minaj spoke about the video in an interview for MTV News: [...] "A lot of times, more famous artists or more confident artists take from a younger artist but they’ll never include you in that. I feel like she liked the whole doll thing and she wanted to do it with me. But she said that: She said, ’Everybody’s gonna say 'she’s doing Nicki.' But I told her, she’s always had a doll persona, like all that ’doll baby’ [...] So it goes perfect with Barbie and we had fun. That’s all that matters." ...|$|E

She signed with the Octagon sports management firm. She said: [...] "It was a hard decision, but I’ve always thought about it in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> I just wanted to try it and have no regrets, because I thought if I didn’t try to go pro, I’d always wonder. I know all the girls at Florida, and they love it there so much. But {{not a lot of people}} get the opportunity to be a professional gymnast and be able to have sponsors.

2500|$|As {{possible}} {{evidence that}} the [...] "sexual song" [...] theory was created later, songwriter LaBostrie was quoted as saying, [...] "Little Richard didn't write none of 'Tutti Frutti'. I'll tell you exactly how I came to write that. I used to live on Galvez Street and my girlfriend and I liked {{to go down to}} the drug store and buy ice cream. One day we went in and saw this new flavor, Tutti Frutti. Right away I thought, 'Boy, that's a great idea for a song'. So I kept it in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> until I got to the studio that day. I also wrote the flip side of 'Tutti Frutti', 'I'm Just A Lonely Guy', and a spiritual, 'Blessed Mother', all in the same day." [...] LaBostrie was still receiving royalty checks on the average of $5,000 every three to six months from the song in the 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert {{awarded the}} film two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing: [...] "It is a well-directed film, because Besson has a natural gift for {{plunging}} into drama with a charged-up visual style. And {{it is well}} acted." [...] However, he was not entirely complimentary: [...] "Always at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> was the troubled {{thought that there was}} something wrong about placing a 12-year-old character {{in the middle of this}} action. ... In what is essentially an exercise—a slick urban thriller—it seems to exploit the youth of the girl without really dealing with it." [...] The New York Times Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "The Professional is much too sentimental to sound shockingly amoral in the least. Even in a finale of extravagant violence, it manages to be maudlin … Mr. Oldman expresses most of the film's sadism as well as many of its misguidedly poetic sentiments." ...|$|E
2500|$|Woolf {{wrote about}} meeting Sackville-West in 1925: [...] "Vita shines in the grocer's shop in Sevenoaks...pink growing, grape clustered, pearl hung...There is her {{maturity}} and full-breastedness; her being so much full in sail {{on the high}} tides, where I am coasting down backwaters; her capacity I mean to take the floor in any company, to represent her country, to visit Chatsworth, to control silver, servants, chow dogs, her motherhood...her in short being (what I have never been) a real woman". [...] Sackville-West greatly admired Woolf's writings, declaring in a 1925 letter: [...] "My darling, last night I went to bed early and read Mrs. Dalloway-It was a very curious sensation: I thought {{you were in the}} room...I was very unhappy because I had a row with my mother and very happy because of you; so it felt like being two different people at the same time...I felt quite light, as though I was falling through my bed, like when one has a high fever. Today I am quite solid again and my boots are quite muddy. They weigh me down. Yet I am not solid as usual-not quite an oaf-because there is at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> all the time...a glow, a sort of nebula, which only when I examine it hardens into a shape; as soon as I think of something else it dissolves again, remaining there like the sun through a fog and I have to reach out again, to take it into my hands & feel its contours: then it hardens, [...] "Virginia is coming on Saturday!". Sackville-West considered Woolf to be the better writer, telling Woolf in one letter: [...] "I contrast my illiterate writing with your scholarly one, and I am ashamed". Though Woolf envied Sackville-West's ability to quickly turn out books compared to her laborious efforts to turn out a novel, she was inclined to agree with this assessment, writing in her diary that A Passenger to Tehran was written too much in haste as [...] "Vita's prose is too fluent". Before going on her second trip to Persia in 1927, a chastened Sackville-West, after receiving several letters from Woolf telling her not to churn out books, wrote to Woolf: [...] "I shall work so hard , partly to please you and partly to please myself...I treasure your sudden discourse on literature yesterday morning, a send-off to me, rather like Polonius to Laertes. It is quite true that you have had infinitely more influence on me intellectually than anyone else, and for this alone, I love you...You do like me to write well, don't you? And I do hate writing badly-and having written so badly in the past. But now, like Queen Victoria, I will be good".|$|E
