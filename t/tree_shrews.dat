40|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>shrew</b> {{has been}} used as a primate animal model in {{neuroscience}} studies but it has only rarely been employed in the study of reproductive systems. This is mainly because we know very little about the histological features of reproductive organs of the <b>tree</b> <b>shrew.</b> In this study, we have systematically analyzed the histology of reproductive organs of <b>tree</b> <b>shrew,</b> in comparison with human organs. The uterus of female <b>tree</b> <b>shrew</b> is uterus biomes unicolis, which is connected with an enveloped ovary through a thin fallopian tube. Histologically, the fallopian tube consists of folded mucosa, muscularis and serosa. Like other mammalian animals, the different developmental stages (primordial, primary, secondary and Graafian follicles) of ovarian follicles including inner oocyte and outer granulosa cells are embedded in the cortex. The luminal endometrium, middle muscular myometrium and serosa constitute the wall of uterus of <b>tree</b> <b>shrew.</b> The uterine endometrium contains simple columnar ciliated cells and goblet cells, and there are rich uterine glands in underlying stroma. Furthermore, these glands of <b>tree</b> <b>shrew</b> are round and smaller during anestrus, and become much longer when they are in estrus. The uterine endometrium in younger animals was less developed when compared to a mature <b>tree</b> <b>shrew.</b> Compared to human uterine endometrium, the histological features of <b>tree</b> <b>shrew</b> are very similar, indicating that it could potentially be good primate animal model for studying the diseases in reproductive system...|$|R

To assess the potential of the Chinese <b>tree</b> <b>shrew</b> for pharmacological testing, we performed drug target prediction and analysis on genomic and transcriptomic scales. Using our pipeline, 3, 482 proteins were predicted to be drug targets. Of these predicted targets, 446 and 1, 049 proteins with the highest rank and total scores, respectively, included homologs of targets for cancer chemotherapy, depression, age-related decline and cardiovascular disease. Based on comparative analyses, more than half of drug target proteins identified from the <b>tree</b> <b>shrew</b> genome were shown to be higher similarity to human targets than in the mouse. Target validation also demonstrated that the constitutive expression of the proteinase-activated receptors of <b>tree</b> <b>shrew</b> platelets is similar to that of human platelets but differs from that of mouse platelets.

In this study, the proteome of liver and muscle tissue in <b>tree</b> the <b>shrew</b> was identified by combining peptide fractionation and LC-MS/MS identification. In total, 2146 proteins were detected, including 1759 proteins in liver samples and 885 proteins in skeletal muscle samples from the <b>tree</b> <b>shrew.</b> Further sub-source analysis revealed that nearly half of the identified proteins (846 proteins and 418 proteins) were derived from human database. In this study, we are the first to describe the characteristics of the proteome from the liver and skeletal muscle of the <b>tree</b> <b>shrew.</b> Phylogenetic <b>tree</b> analysis based on these proteomic data showed that the <b>tree</b> <b>shrew</b> is closer to primates (human) than to glires (the mouse and rat).|$|R

The Chinese <b>tree</b> <b>shrew</b> (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) has been proposed as an alternative experimental animal to primates in biomedical research. However, {{there is a lack of}} biological knowledge about the immune system of the <b>tree</b> <b>shrew.</b> In this study, we cloned the IL 7 gene (tIL 7) in the Chinese <b>tree</b> <b>shrew</b> and quantified the expression of mRNA transcripts in eight tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, intestine, skeletal muscle and brain) from 20 individuals. Eleven tIL 7 mRNA transcripts were identified in different tissues. The canonical form (tIL 7 c) had a length of 1817 bp and encoded a predicted gene product with 177 amino acids. Phylogenetic analyses based on the amino acid sequences revealed a considerably large genetic difference between <b>tree</b> <b>shrew</b> and human. Quantification of mRNA expression of transcripts tIL 7 c, tIL 7 -sv 1, tIL 7 -sv 2 and tIL 7 -sv 3 showed that these transcripts were expressed in all tissues, albeit the expression levels varied in different tissues. Transcripts tIL 7 c, tIL 7 -sv 1, and tIL 7 -sv 2 had the lowest expression in brain, and tIL 7 -sv 3 had a dramatically high mRNA expression in skeletal muscle and heart.

This study was carried out to discover the potential mechanism. Methods Blood samples were collected from healthy men and male animals. Plasma lipid profile and activities of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) were measured, compared and analyzed in human, <b>tree</b> <b>shrew,</b> and Beijing duck. Results The results showed that there were species differences on plasma lipid profile and activities of CETP and PLTP in the three species. Compared with human, <b>tree</b> <b>shrew</b> and beijing duck had higher high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) /total cholesterol (TC) and HDL-C/low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ratios, but lower CETP and PLTP activities. In the three species, CETP and PLTP activities were negatively related with the ratio of HDL-C/LDL-C.

Moreover, low PLTP activity may also make the animals resistant to AS by the relative high vitamin E content of apoB-containing lipoproteins and high anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties of HDL particles.

40|$|Cortical {{pyramidal}} cells, {{while having}} a characteristic morphology, show marked phenotypic variation in primates. Differences {{have been reported}} in their size, branching structure and spine density between cortical areas. In particular, there is a systematic increase in the complexity of the structure of pyramidal cells with anterior progression through occipito-temporal cortical visual areas. These differences reflect area-specific specializations in cortical circuitry, which are believed to be important for visual processing. However, it remains unknown as to whether these regional specializations in pyramidal cell structure are restricted to primates. Here we investigated pyramidal cell structure in the visual cortex of the <b>tree</b> <b>shrew,</b> including the primary (V 1), second (V 2) and temporal dorsal (TD) areas. As in primates, there was a trend for more complex branching structure with anterior progression through visual areas in the <b>tree</b> <b>shrew.</b> However, contrary to the trend reported in primates, cells in the <b>tree</b> <b>shrew</b> tended to become smaller with anterior progression through V 1, V 2 and TD.

Here, the phylogenetic tree, sequence alignment and protein structure model of <b>tree</b> <b>shrew</b> and human IL- 21 were analyzed using bioinformatics software. A pEGFP-N 3 /tsIL- 21 eukaryotic expression vector of <b>tree</b> <b>shrew</b> IL- 21 (tsIL- 21) was constructed, and IL- 21 expression by the vector-transfected Huh 7 cells was evaluated using the newly established quantitative real-time PCR and immunologic protocols for assessing human IL- 21. The cytokine profiles were also evaluated in <b>tree</b> <b>shrew</b> spleen lymphocytes induced by recombinant human IL- 21 or concanavalin A. It was found that the coding sequence (CDS) of tsIL- 21 amplified from spleen lymphocytes belonged to the predicted sequence. The tsIL- 21 was closely clustered with primate IL- 21 rather than rodent IL- 21, and it had an alignment of 83. 33 % with the human IL- 21 nucleotide sequence and 69. 93 % with the amino acid sequence. The profiles of secondary structure, hydrophobicity and surface charge of tsIL- 21 were also similar with those of human IL- 21. The tsIL- 21 expressed by the vector-transfected Huh 7 cells could be identified by their different sources of antibodies against human IL- 21, which were all dose-dependent. Recombinant human IL- 21 could induce the change of the cytokine profiles of <b>tree</b> <b>shrew</b> spleen lymphocytes, which showed a higher expression of IL- 10 and IFN-Î³ rather than IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 17, TNF-a and IL- 21 during the five-day stimulation. These results indicate that tsIL- 21 has a high degree of homology, structural similarity and immunological cross-reactivity with human IL- 21 and also confirm the accuracy of this predicted tsIL- 21 CDS.
