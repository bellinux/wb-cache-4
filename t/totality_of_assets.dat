40|$|In this study, we employ an {{innovative}} new methodology inspired from {{the approach of}} Hwang and Salmon (2004) {{and based on the}} cross sectional dispersion of trading volume to examine the herding behavior on Toronto stock exchange. Our findings show that the herd phenomenon consists of three essential components: stationary herding which signals the existence of the phenomenon whatever the market conditions, intentional herding relative to the anticipations of the investors concerning the <b>totality</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets,</b> and the third component highlights that the current herding depends on the previous one which is the feedback herding.

Till följd av EU-domstolens avgörande i X BV och HFD:s avgörande i HFD 2014 ref. 1 står nu klart att kostnader hänförliga till en från mervärdesskatt undantagen aktieöverlå- telse också kan utgöra allmänna omkostnader, vilket medför att den ingående mervär- desskatten är avdragsgill i den mån förvärven har ett direkt och omedelbart samband med den samlade ekonomiska verksamheten eller en avgränsad del därav. Avgörandena i X BV och HFD 2014 ref. 1 innebär även att det nu står klart att en aktieö- verlåtelse kan utgöra en del i en verksamhetsöverlåtelse. För förvärv som gjorts i samband med en sådan transaktion är den ingående mervärdesskatten avdragsgill i sin helhet. Utredningen visar att eftersom det i HFD 2014 ref. 1 aldrig prövades om kostnaderna kunde anses utgöra allmänna omkostnader har underinstanserna såväl som Skatteverket inte fått ledning i hur bedömningen ska göras. Författaren anser att Skatteverket och un- derinstanserna i sin prövning av om kostnader för förvärv kan anses utgöra allmänna om- kostnader inte tar hänsyn till de EU-rättsliga principer som EU-domstolen har framhållit. Vidare anser författaren att rättsläget efter X BV och HFD 2014 ref. 1 innebär att den rätt till avdrag av ingående mervärdesskatt hänförlig till förvärv i samband med aktieöverlåtelser som svenska beskattningsbara personer ska erhålla enligt EU-rätt, synes skilja sig från den faktiska rätt som erhålls i praktiken.  The input VAT {{related to}} {{acquisitions}} made {{that have a}} direct and immediate link with a share transfer that constitute a transaction that is exempted from VAT, is not deductible. Due to the EU Court of Justice’s ruling in X BV and HFD:s ruling in HFD 2014 ref. 1 {{it is now clear}} that costs related to a share transfer exempted from VAT also can constitute overheads, with the result that the input VAT is deductible to the extent the acquisitions have a direct and immediate link with the whole economic activity or a clearly defined part of the economic activities. The rulings in X BV and HFD 2014 ref. 1 mean that {{it is now clear that}} a share transfer can be a part of a transfer of a <b>totality</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets.</b> For acquisitions made in connection with such a transfer, the input VAT is entirely deductible. The thesis shows that due to the fact that the ruling in HFD 2014 ref. 1 did not include a determination of if the costs in question could constitute overheads, the Swedish courts of lower instances as well as Skatteverket have not received any guidance on how the deter- mination is to be made. The author is of the opinion that the courts of lower instances and Skatteverket in their determination of whether costs related to acquisitions can constitute overheads do not consider the EU-law principles declared by the EU Court of Justice. Further, the author is of the opinion that the legal situation due to X BV and HFD 2014 ref. 1 mean that the right to deduct input VAT related to acquisitions made in connection with share transfers that Swedish taxable persons are supposed to obtain in accordance with EU-law seem to differ from the rights actually obtained in practice. ...|$|E
