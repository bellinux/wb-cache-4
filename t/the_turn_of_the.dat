5|$|Critics {{were divided}} in their reviews of <b>The</b> <b>Turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Screw.

40|$|AbstractThe classic {{approach}} for cochlear implant surgery includes mastoidectomy and posterior tympanotomy. The middle cranial fossa {{approach is a}} proven alternative, {{but it has been}} used only sporadically and inconsistently in cochlear implantation. ObjectiveTo describe a new approach to expose <b>the</b> basal <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cochlea in cochlear implant surgery through the middle cranial fossa. MethodFifty temporal bones were dissected in this anatomic study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temporal bone. Cochleostomies were performed through the middle cranial fossa approach in the most superficial portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basal <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cochlea, using the meatal plane and the superior petrous sinus as landmarks. <b>The</b> lateral wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> internal acoustic canal was dissected after the petrous apex had been drilled and stripped. <b>The</b> dissected wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner acoustic canal was followed longitudinally to the cochleostomy. ResultsOnly <b>the</b> superficial portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basal <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cochlea was opened in the fifty temporal bones included in this study. <b>The</b> exposure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basal <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cochlea allowed <b>the</b> visualization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scala tympani and the scala vestibuli, which enabled the array to be easily inserted through the scala tympani. ConclusionThe proposed approach is simple to use and provides sufficient exposure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basal <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cochlea...|$|R
