5|$|Coastal troop deployments, {{comprising}} five {{companies of}} infantry, were concentrated mostly at 15 strongpoints called Widerstandsnester ("resistance nests"), numbered WN-60 {{in the east}} to WN-74 near Vierville in the west, located primarily around the entrances to the draws and protected by minefields and wire. Positions within each strongpoint were interconnected by trenches and tunnels. As well as the basic weaponry of rifles and machine guns, more than 60 light artillery pieces were deployed at these strongpoints. The heaviest pieces were located in eight gun casemates and four open positions while the lighter guns were housed in 35 pillboxes. A further 18 anti-tank guns completed <b>the</b> <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> artillery targeting the beach. Areas between the strongpoints were lightly manned with occasional trenches, rifle pits, and 85 machine-gun emplacements. No area of the beach was left uncovered, and <b>the</b> <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> weapons meant that flanking fire could {{be brought to bear}} anywhere along the beach.|$|E
5|$|Information {{about the}} Bruneval radar {{installation}} was also gathered during this period, {{often with the}} help of the French Resistance, without whom detailed knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> the German forces guarding the installation would have been impossible.

5|$|After Williams' death, Audrey Williams filed a suit in Nashville against MGM Records and Acuff-Rose. The suit {{demanded that}} both of the {{publishing}} companies continue to pay her half of the royalties from Hank Williams' records. Williams had an agreement giving his first wife half of the royalties, but allegedly there was no clarification that the deal was valid after his death. Because Williams may have left no will, <b>the</b> <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> the other fifty percent was considered uncertain; those involved included the second Mrs. Williams and her daughter and Hank Williams' mother and sister.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 7 September 1191, as Richard's forces {{began moving}} out of camp enemy scouts were visible in all directions, hinting that Saladin's whole army lay hidden in the woodland.

The {{probable}} posts of greatest danger, at the front and especially {{the rear of the}} column, were given to the military orders. They had the most experience of fighting in the East, were arguably the most disciplined, and were the only formations which included Turcopole cavalry who fought like the Turkish horse archers of the Ayyubid army.|$|E

5|$|After {{his final}} return to Northumbria Wilfrid retired to the monastery at Ripon, {{where he lived}} until his death {{during a visit to}} Oundle, at the age of 75. A little over a year before his death in either 709 or 710 Wilfrid {{suffered}} another stroke or seizure, which led him to make arrangements for <b>the</b> <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> his monasteries and possessions. He was buried near the altar of his church in Ripon. Bede records the epitaph that was placed on the tomb. Wilfrid was succeeded at Hexham by Acca of Hexham, a protégé who had accompanied him to Rome in 703. The monastery at Ripon celebrated the first anniversary of Wilfrid's death with a commemoration service attended by all the abbots of his monasteries and a spectacular white arc was said to have appeared in the sky starting from the gables of the basilica where his bones were laid to rest.|$|E
5|$|Altogether, Hawkins called 215 witnesses, {{including}} {{numbers from}} France, Melipilla, Australia and Wapping, who testified either that the Claimant was not Roger Tichborne {{or that he}} was Arthur Orton. A handwriting expert swore that the Claimant's writing resembled Orton's but not Roger Tichborne's. The entire story of rescue by the Osprey was, Hawkins asserted, a fraud. A ship of that name had arrived in Melbourne in July 1854 but did not correspond to the Claimant's description. Furthermore, the Claimant had provided the wrong name for Ospreys captain, and the names he gave for two of Ospreys crew were found to belong {{to members of the}} crew of the Middleton, the ship which had landed Orton at Hobart. No mention of a rescue had been found in Ospreys log or in the Melbourne harbourmaster's records. Giving evidence on the contents of the sealed packet, Gosford revealed that it contained information regarding <b>the</b> <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> certain properties, but nothing relating to Katherine Doughty's seduction or pregnancy.|$|E

Banks had been diagnosed with dementia shortly before the change in his will. A Chicago funeral home sent Elizabeth a bill for $35,000 in funeral costs, but the bill went unpaid as Elizabeth challenged the legality of Banks' new will. In March 2015, the Chicago Cubs announced that they would pay the funeral home costs.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the British {{government}} {{comes under}} public pressure {{to resolve the}} problem. It becomes clear to the British diplomats assigned {{to find a solution}} that defeating the Burgundians through starvation is both difficult and unpopular with the British people, so they negotiate. The sticking point turns out to be <b>the</b> <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> the unearthed treasure. Wix, now the Burgundian Chancellor of the Exchequer, suggests a Burgundian loan of the treasure to Britain. With the final piece of the deadlock eliminated, Burgundy reunites with Britain, which also sees the return of rationing for food and clothing to the area. The celebratory outdoor banquet is interrupted by heavy rain.|$|E

40|$|This article aims at a {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} invalidity of states’ consent and examines {{the manner in which}} they are regulated in the Public International Law and in the domestic law. Thus, according to <b>the</b> <b>dispositions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vienna Convention (1969) on the law of treaties between states, invalidity of states’ consent are: breach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispositions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic law of the state regarding the competence to sign treaties; the error; the fraud; the corruption of a state representative; the coercion of a state representative; the coercion against a state. The invalidity of states’ consent are sanctioned both in the matter of the Public International Law as well as in the domestic civil law by nullity, either absolute (such as the coercion exercised on the state representative and the coercion against a state) or relative (such as <b>the</b> breach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispositions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic law of the state regarding the competence to sign treaties, the error, the fraud or the corruption of a state representative). In certain cases, <b>the</b> <b>dispositions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic law are fully mirrored by the regulations of the Vienna Convention, as is the case of the fraud, but there are also cases – <b>the</b> breach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispositions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic law of the state regarding the competence to sign treaties – where the Vienna Convention introduces a disposition which flagrantly contradicts the civil theory in the matter, the state being able to invoke itself the defect in its consent. At the same time, in the domestic civil law, the rule according to which no one can invoke his/her own turpitude is widely sanctioned. We conclude by showing that the manner of regulation of nullity taken over from the domestic civil law and transposed in <b>the</b> <b>dispositions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vienna Convention fails to meet the exigencies and rigors of the definition of nullity. Public International Law, civil law, Vienna Convention...|$|R

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 3 July, she ferried Captain Cedric Holland, the {{emissary}} of Admiral James Somerville, commander of Force H, to meet with Admiral Marcel-Bruno Gensoul, commander of the Vichy French forces at Mers-el-Kébir, Algeria. Holland was to deliver an ultimatum regarding <b>the</b> <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> the French ships there {{to ensure that they}} could not {{fall into the hands of}} the Germans. Gensoul initially refused to meet with such a low-ranking envoy, but later relented and negotiations were underway that afternoon to disarm the French ships in place when the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, ordered the talks terminated to forestall the impending arrival of French reinforcements. The British opened fire a half-hour later, including Foxhound. A month later the ship escorted Force H during Operation Hurry, a mission to fly off fighter aircraft for Malta and conduct an airstrike on Cagliari on 2 August. Shortly afterwards, she escorted Hood back home and began a refit at Sheerness that lasted until October.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day, the Egyptian forces also changed <b>the</b> <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> their forces, moving the 9th Battalion to the Ad Halom bridge, the 2nd to Isdud itself, and the 1st to Iraq Suwaydan and Faluja. Heavy machine gun and armored units were {{dispersed}} in between. Staff soldiers {{and those who}} manned Bren carriers took positions together with regular infantry soldiers. The Israeli side {{did not know of}} this development, but was aware that they had been detected in the previous night's preparations. The army was against attacking Isdud soon, but the order was given by the political echelon. The attack was expected to be a tactical failure; Avraham Ayalon writes that it could have succeeded if only the southern Egyptian force in Isdud itself was attacked, but attributes that lack of such a plan to the inexperience of the command and the heterogeneous nature of the Israeli force, which according to him could not have pulled off such an offensive.|$|E
5|$|Second, Giáp made {{a mistake}} in Nà Sản by {{committing}} his forces to reckless frontal attacks before being fully prepared. He learned his lesson: at Điện Biên Phủ, Giáp spent months meticulously stockpiling ammunition and emplacing heavy artillery and antiaircraft guns before making his move. Teams of Viet Minh volunteers were sent into the French camp to scout <b>the</b> <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> the French artillery. Wooden artillery pieces were built as decoys and the real guns were rotated every few salvos to confuse French counterbattery fire. As a result, when the battle finally began, the Viet Minh knew exactly where the French artillery pieces were, while the French did not even know how many guns Giáp possessed.|$|E
