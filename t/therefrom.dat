5|$|Riemannian {{manifolds}} are manifolds whose tangent {{spaces are}} endowed with a suitable inner product. Derived <b>therefrom,</b> the Riemann curvature tensor encodes all curvatures of a manifold in one object, which finds applications in general relativity, for example, where the Einstein curvature tensor describes {{the matter and}} energy content of space-time. The tangent space of a Lie group can be given naturally {{the structure of a}} Lie algebra and can be used to classify compact Lie groups.|$|E

The code was developed by Frenchman Émile Baudot in the 1870s, and was a widely used method of terrestrial and telegraph communication.|$|E

25|$|If {{a person}} has wrongfully damaged to the body, health, reputation, liberty, credit, privacy or {{chastity}} of another, or to another's personality in a severe way, the injured person may claim a reasonable compensation in money even if such injury is not a purely pecuniary loss. If it was reputation that has been damaged, the injured person may also claim the taking of proper measures for the rehabilitation of his reputation. A person who, intentionally or negligently, has wrongfully damaged the rights of another is bound to compensate him for any injury arising <b>therefrom.</b> The same rule shall be applied when the injury is done intentionally in a manner against the rules of morals. A person, who violates a statutory provision enacted {{for the protection of}} others and therefore prejudice to others, is bound to compensate for the injury, except no negligence in his act can be proved. If several persons have wrongfully damaged the rights of another jointly, they are jointly liable for the injury arising <b>therefrom.</b> The same rule shall be applied even if which one has actually caused the injury cannot be sure. Instigators and accomplices are deemed to be joint tortfeasors.|$|E
25|$|I {{think there}} is a growing distaste for the family duties among women … that should be condemned. The efforts of women to equal man in studies, work, etc., while still {{claiming}} their sex privileges, with the dissolution of club and society life, are leading to a 'race suicide.' This ought not to be. Woman is anatomically, physiologically, and emotionally evolved for one sole and single purpose, any departure <b>therefrom</b> being done at the violation of her best ideals and a misdirection of energy.|$|E
25|$|If {{injury is}} caused by an animal, the {{possessor}} is bound to compensate the injured person for any injury arising <b>therefrom,</b> unless reasonable care in keeping according to the species {{and nature of the}} animal has been exercised, or unless the injury would have been occasioned notwithstanding the exercise of such reasonable care. The possessor may claim for reimbursement against the third party, who has excited or provoked the animal, or against the possessor of another animal which has caused the excitement or provocation.|$|E
25|$|The Omer, {{which the}} Torah {{mentions}} as being equal to one-tenth of an Eiphah, {{is equivalent to}} the capacity of 43.2 eggs, or what is also known as one-tenth of three seahs. In dry weight, the omer weighed between 1.560 kg. to 1.770 kg., being the quantity of flour required to separate <b>therefrom</b> the dough offering. In the Torah, it is the Priestly Code which refers to the Omer, rather than to the Se'ah or Kab; textual scholars view the Priestly Code as one of the later sources of the Torah, dating from a period when Egypt and Assyria had much more direct influence over Israel.|$|E

Its walls are highly muscular, but all the muscles are longitudinal {{and there is no}} circular muscular bulb. Its outstanding feature is the presence of a long, slender, sharply pointed, scimitar-shaped, black, horny stylet with a saddle-shaped base which is sometimes prolonged into a long, sharply pointed spur. In some individuals, however, the spur is completely absent.|$|E
25|$|An official, who has {{intentionally}} {{committed a}} breach of duty which he ought to exercise {{in favor of a}} third party and therefore prejudice to such third party, is liable for any injury arising <b>therefrom.</b> If the breach is the result of this official's negligence, he may be held liable to compensate only in so far as the injured person is unable to obtain compensation by other means. In the case mentioned in the preceding sentence, if the injured person who may obviate the injury by making use of a legal remedy has intentionally or negligently omitted to make use of it, the official shall not be liable to compensate for the injury.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{otherwise}} {{provided by}} the act or by the contract, the compensation shall {{be limited to the}} injury actually suffered and the interests which have been lost. Interests which could have been normally expected are deemed to be the interests which have been lost, according to the ordinary course of things, the decided projects, equipment, or other particular circumstances. A person who has wrongfully caused the death of another shall also be bound to make compensation for the injury to any person incurring the medical expenses, increasing the need in living, or incurring the funeral expenses. If the deceased was statutorily bound to furnish maintenance to a third party, the tortfeasor shall also make compensation to such third party for any injury arising <b>therefrom.</b> In case of death caused by a wrongful act, the father, mother, sons, daughters and spouse of the deceased may claim for a reasonable compensation in money even if such injury is not a purely pecuniary loss.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} frontier cities once {{marked the}} boundary of the Land of Israel, or the extent of places repopulated after the return from Babylonian exile. In a broader sense, the list of frontier towns and villages herein named represent the geographical limits of regulations imposed upon all agricultural produce, making them fully liable to tithing and to sabbatical-year restrictions within that same border, or, {{in the event of}} being purchased from the common people of the land, to separate <b>therefrom</b> only the demai-tithe. As one moved further east of Achziv, the border extended northward, into what are now portions of south Lebanon, and as far east as places in the present-day Kingdom of Jordan. While the settlements here named reflect a historical reality, bearing heavily on Jewish legal law (Halacha), they did not always reflect a political reality, insofar that the political borders have since changed owing to a long history of occupiers and conquerors.|$|E
25|$|A {{person of}} no {{capacity}} or limited in {{capacity to make}} juridical acts, who has wrongfully damaged the rights of another, shall be jointly liable with his guardian for any injury arising <b>therefrom</b> if {{he is capable of}} discernment at the time of committing such an act. If he is incapable of discernment at the time of committing the act, his guardian alone shall be liable for such injury. In the case of the preceding sentence, the guardian is not liable if there is no negligence in his duty of supervision, or if the injury would have been occasioned notwithstanding the exercise of reasonable supervision. If compensation cannot be obtained according to the provisions of the preceding two sentences, the court may, on the application of the injured person, take the financial conditions among the tortfeasors, the guardian and the injured person into consideration, and order the tortfeasors or his guardian to compensate for a part or the whole of the injury.|$|E
25|$|Resolved, That a {{committee}} of five members be appointed by the Speaker to ascertain and report what contracts {{have been made by}} any of the departments for provisions, supplies, and transportation; for materials, and services, or for any articles furnished for the use of government without advertising for proposals, as required by the statute of 1861; the parties to whom given; the compensation and terms thereof, and the reasons therefor. Also, where proposals were received, if contracts were awarded to the lowest bidder; if not, the reason therefor. Also, whether the contracts, as let, are in accordance with the specifications inviting proposals; and if any alterations, the reasons for the same. Also, whether any person or persons have any interest in the contracts thus made and awarded, or obtained the same, or profits <b>therefrom,</b> except the contractors. That said committee shall have power to send for persons and papers to administer oaths and examine witnesses, and report at any time.|$|E
25|$|An investigatory stop is {{a seizure}} under the Fourth Amendment. The state must justify the seizure {{by showing that}} the officer {{conducting}} the stop had a reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. The {{important point is that}} officers cannot deprive a citizen of liberty unless the officer can point to specific facts and circumstances and inferences <b>therefrom</b> that would amount to a reasonable suspicion. The officer must be prepared to establish that criminal activity was a logical explanation for what he perceived. The requirement serves to prevent officers from stopping individuals based merely on hunches or unfounded suspicions. The purpose of the stop and detention is to investigate to the extent necessary to confirm or dispel the original suspicion. If the initial confrontation with the person stopped dispels suspicion of criminal activity the officer must end the detention and allow the person to go about his or her business. If the investigation confirms the officer's initial suspicion or reveals evidence that would justify continued detention the officer may require the person detained to remain at the scene until further investigation is complete.|$|E
25|$|The debtor {{shall be}} {{responsible}} for his acts, whether intentional or negligent. The extent of responsibility for one's negligence varies with the particular nature of the affair; but such responsibility shall be lessened, if the affair {{is not intended to}} procure interests to the debtor. If there is change of circumstances which is not predictable then after the constitution of the contract, and if the performance of the original obligation arising <b>therefrom</b> will become obviously unfair, the party may apply to the court for increasing or reducing his payment, or altering the original obligation. If according {{to the nature of the}} contract or the expression of intent of the parties, the purpose of the contract can not be accomplished if not performed within the fixed period, and if one of the parties does not perform the contract within that period, the other party may rescind the contract without giving the notice specified in the preceding article. Unless otherwise provided by the act or by the contract, a person who is bound to make compensation for an injury shall restore the injured party to the status quo before the injury. If the restoration of the status quo ante shall be paid in money, interest shall be added from the time of the injury.|$|E
