25|$|The most {{important}} contemporary standards are informed and voluntary consent. After World War II, the Nuremberg Code was established because of Nazi abuses of experimental subjects. Later, most countries (and scientific journals) adopted the Declaration of Helsinki. In the U.S., the National Institutes of Health established <b>the</b> <b>Institutional</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> in 1966, and in 1974 adopted the National Research Act (HR 7724). All {{of these measures}} encouraged researchers to obtain informed consent from human participants in experimental studies. A number of influential studies led {{to the establishment of}} this rule; such studies included the MIT and Fernald School radioisotope studies, the Thalidomide tragedy, the Willowbrook hepatitis study, and Stanley Milgram's studies of obedience to authority.|$|E
2500|$|Another partial {{replication}} {{of the experiment}} was conducted by Jerry M. Burger in 2006 and broadcast on the Primetime series Basic Instincts. Burger noted that [...] "current standards {{for the ethical treatment}} of participants clearly place Milgram's studies out of bounds." [...] In 2009, Burger was able to receive approval from <b>the</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>review</b> <b>board</b> by modifying several of the experimental protocols. Burger found obedience rates virtually identical to those reported by Milgram found in 1961–62, even while meeting current ethical regulations of informing participants. In addition, half the replication participants were female, and their rate of obedience was virtually identical to that of the male participants. Burger also included a condition in which participants first saw another participant refuse to continue. However, participants in this condition obeyed at the same rate as participants in the base condition.|$|E
