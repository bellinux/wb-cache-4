[...] Meanwhile, the Theatre Guild took Molnár to see Oklahoma! [...] Molnár stated that if Rodgers and Hammerstein could adapt Liliom as beautifully as they had modified Green Grow the Lilacs into Oklahoma!, he would be pleased to have <b>them</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> [...] The Guild obtained the rights from Molnár in October 1943. [...] The playwright received one percent of the gross and $2,500 for [...] "personal services". [...] The duo insisted, as part of the contract, that Molnár permit them to make changes in the plot. [...] At first, the playwright refused, but eventually yielded. [...] Hammerstein later stated that if this point had not been won, [...] "we could never have made Carousel." ...|$|E
500|$|The new {{publisher}} scrapped Vanderbilt's editorial policy, {{and began}} a campaign against vice. The Los Angeles police chief, James E. Davis, had a hands-off policy {{when it came to}} vice and organized crime. Most local reporters valued the perks given to them by the police, and did nothing to push the issue. [...] After Boddy began a crusade against crime and corruption, he weathered harassment by police and politicians, circulation rose, and the paper was soon showing a profit. Boddy also streamlined operations and stabilized the paper's management. During the first six years of Boddy's ownership, the Daily News maintained a conservative editorial policy. By 1932, Boddy had dropped the word [...] "Illustrated" [...] from the name of the paper. He was a personal supporter of Herbert Hoover's bid for reelection. Los Angeles newspaper owners met and decided that, with all newspaper owners supporting Hoover, one paper had to support Democratic candidate and New York governor Franklin Roosevelt, and Boddy and the Daily News volunteered for the job. The day after the election, which saw Roosevelt elected, Boddy turned to his city editor and said of the voters: [...] "They have made a terrible mistake. I helped <b>them</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> But damn it, I had to make a living." ...|$|E

Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, and called the script [...] "very witty". The two wrote that [...] "the brilliance of Chris Carter's direction" [...] allowed the viewer of the episode to see it [...] "from God's point of view". Shearman and Pearson concluded that the episode [...] "is not as smart as it thinks it is. But it's still pretty smart." [...] John Keegan, writing for Critical Myth, on the other hand, gave the episode a more mixed review {{and gave it a}} 6 out of 10 rating. He wrote that [...] "overall, this episode was amusing enough, but there was nothing about it that would prompt me to rank it as highly as the more inspired [...] "lite" [...] episodes of previous seasons. And considering that the sixth and seventh seasons suffered tremendously from too many episodes like this, it's a shame to see <b>them</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, called the episode [...] "bizarre yet amusing" [...] and said that the central numerology story [...] "doesn't feel like it's enough to sustain an entire episode".|$|E
