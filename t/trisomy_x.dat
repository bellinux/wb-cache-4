Cytogenetic analysis was performed on nonmalignant breast tissue from benign breast lumps (n = 8), reduction mammoplasties (n = 31), and grossly nontumorous tissue from cancerous breasts (n = 84), using standard techniques and G-banding. All samples were reviewed histologically. Clonal chromosomal changes were found in three of eight benign breast tumors (38 %). Of the reduction mammoplasties, 17 samples contained nonproliferative changes, and three of these (18 %) showed a clonal deletion of 3 p. No pathology was identified in the other 14 samples, of which one (7 %) contained two clonal changes, apparently balanced translocations. Of nontumorous tissues from cancerous breasts, 15 (18 %) showed clonal chromosomal abnormalities. Five of these samples were histologically normal. Two clones were identical {{to those found in}} the corresponding cancer. In 18 additional samples, single cells were detected with the same change as that seen in clones or single cells in the cancer. Only 4 of these 20 samples contained detectable cancer cells. Clonal abnormalities found in two or more samples included <b>trisomies</b> <b>X,</b> 7, and 20 and monosomies 19 and 18. Clonal changes were not significantly more frequent in proliferative than in nonproliferative lesions. The Icelandic BRCA 2 founder mutation, 999 del 5, was detected in four samples, all histologically normal, two of which had clonal chromosomal abnormalities. In conclusion, clonal chromosomal changes are not infrequent in nonmalignant breast tissue and can be detected {{even in the absence of}} histological abnormalities...|$|R
40|$|To {{estimate}} whether multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), {{a molecular}} technique used for detecting {{the most common}} chromosomal aneuploidies, is comparable with karyotyping {{for the detection of}} aneuploidies of chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18, and 21 in routine clinical practice and to estimate the costs differences of both techniques. In this prospective, nationwide cohort study, we consecutively included 4, 585 women who had an amniocentesis because of their age (36 years or older), increased risk after prenatal screening, or maternal anxiety. Amniotic fluid samples were tested independently with both MLPA and karyotyping. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy of MLPA to detect aneuploidies of chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18, and 21. Secondary outcome measures were turnaround time for test results and costs. A sample size was calculated using a critical noninferiority margin of 0. 002; therefore, at least 4, 497 paired test results were needed (one-sided alpha 0. 05, power 0. 90). Diagnostic accuracy of MLPA was 1. 0 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 99 - 1. 0), sensitivity was 100 % (95 % CI 0. 96 - 1. 0) and specificity was 100 % (95 % CI 0. 999 - 1. 0). Diagnostic accuracy of MLPA was statistically similar (noninferior) to that of karyotyping (P <. 001). In 75 cases, MLPA failed (1. 6 %); karyotyping failed once (0. 02 %). Compared with karyotyping, MLPA shortened the waiting time by 14. 5 days (P <. 001, 95 % CI 14. 3 - 14. 6) and cost less (- 47, P <. 001).

30|$|Spontaneous {{miscarriage}} is {{the most}} common complication in early pregnancy, occurring at the frequency of 10 â€“ 15 Â % of all clinically recognized pregnancies. Approximately 50 Â % of miscarriages are caused by chromosomal abnormalities of conception, such as autosomal <b>trisomy,</b> polyploidy, monosomy <b>X,</b> and structural abnormalities (Stephenson and Kutteh 2007; van den Berg et al. 2012). Most of these abnormalities occur sporadically and become crucial obstacle for women hoping for a child. At present, cytogenetic analysis of spontaneously aborted products of conception (POC) is not routinely performed. For women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), however, cytogenetic analysis of POC is practically essential for the evaluation of currently-performed treatments and the management of subsequent pregnancies (Stephenson et al. 2002; Brezina and Kutteh 2014). In case of structural abnormality inherited from either parent, preimplantation genetic diagnosis is recommended to avoid another miscarriage. Repeated aneuploidy results could be plausible indication of preimplantation genetic screening in future (Chang et al. 2011; Dahdouh et al. 2015).|$|R

50|$|X {{chromosomes}} {{in females}} undergo {{a process known}} as X inactivation. X inactivation is when one of the two X chromosomes in females is almost completely inactivated. It is important that this process occurs otherwise a woman would produce twice the amount of normal X chromosome proteins. The mechanism for X inactivation will occur during the embryonic stage. For people with disorders like <b>trisomy</b> <b>X,</b> where the genotype has three X chromosomes, X-inactivation will inactivate all X chromosomes until there is only one X chromosome active. Males with Klinefelter syndrome, who have an extra X chromosome, will also undergo X inactivation to have only one completely active X chromosome.|$|E

The majority have also been reported as being longer and taller. Many also show joint and muscle tone abnormalities, including hypotonia and joint looseness in the hips. Skeletal problems may also be present, including abnormal curvatures of the spine.

40|$|Abstract <b>Trisomy</b> <b>X</b> is a sex {{chromosome}} anomaly with a variable phenotype {{caused by the}} presence of an extra X chromosome in females (47,XXX instead of 46,XX). It is the most common female chromosomal abnormality, occurring in approximately 1 in 1, 000 female births. As some individuals are only mildly affected or asymptomatic, it is estimated that only 10 % of individuals with <b>trisomy</b> <b>X</b> are actually diagnosed. The most common physical features include tall stature, epicanthal folds, hypotonia and clinodactyly. Seizures, renal and genitourinary abnormalities, and premature ovarian failure (POF) can also be associated findings. Children with <b>trisomy</b> <b>X</b> have higher rates of motor and speech delays, with an increased risk of cognitive deficits and learning disabilities in the school-age years. Psychological features including attention deficits, mood disorders (anxiety and depression), and other psychological disorders are also more common than in the general population. <b>Trisomy</b> <b>X</b> most commonly occurs as a result of nondisjunction during meiosis, although postzygotic nondisjunction occurs in approximately 20 % of cases. The risk of <b>trisomy</b> <b>X</b> increases with advanced maternal age. The phenotype in <b>trisomy</b> <b>X</b> is hypothesized to result from overexpression of genes that escape X-inactivation, but genotype-phenotype relationships remain to be defined. Diagnosis during the prenatal period by amniocentesis or chorionic villi sampling is common. Indications for postnatal diagnoses most commonly include developmental delays or hypotonia, learning disabilities, emotional or behavioral difficulties, or POF. Differential diagnosis prior to definitive karyotype results includes fragile X, tetrasomy X, pentasomy X, and Turner syndrome mosaicism. Genetic counseling is recommended. Patients diagnosed in the prenatal period should be followed closely for developmental delays so that early intervention therapies can be implemented as needed. School-age children and adolescents benefit from a psychological evaluation with an emphasis on identifying and developing an intervention plan for problems in cognitive/academic skills, language, and/or social-emotional development. Adolescents and adult women presenting with late menarche, menstrual irregularities, or fertility problems should be evaluated for POF. Patients should be referred to support organizations to receive individual and family support. The prognosis is variable, depending on the severity of the manifestations and on the quality and timing of treatment. </p...|$|E

This study aimed to {{investigate}} aneuploidy in spontaneous abortion by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes for 13, 16, 18, 21, 22, X and Y chromosomes. Methods: A total of 840 chorionic samples from spontaneous abortion were collected and examined by FISH. We analyzed the incidence and type of abnormal cases and sex ratio in the samples. We also analyzed the relationship between the rate of aneuploidy and parental age, the rate of aneuploidy between recurrent abortion and sporadic abortion, the difference in incidence of aneuploidy between samples from previous artificial abortion and those from no previous induced abortion. Results: A total of 832 samples were finally analyzed. 368 (44. 23 %) were abnormal, in which 84. 24 % (310 / 368) were aneuploidies and 15. 76 % (58 / 368) were polyploidies. The first was trisomy 16 (121 / 310), followed by <b>trisomy</b> 22, and <b>X</b> monosomy. There {{was no significant difference in}} the rate of aneuploidy in the advanced maternal age group (â‰¥ 35 years old) and young maternal age group (< 35 years old).

40|$|Background and Objectives The {{chromosome}} 13 deletion (Delta(13)) {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequent chromosomal alterations in multiple myeloma (MM). Delta(13) is associated with an unfavorable prognosis, although there is increasing agreement that its prognostic relevance must be related to the ploidy status and the presence of different chromosomal translocations. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional features of Delta(13) in MM. Design and Methods Highly purified plasma cells from 80 newly diagnosed MM patients were characterized by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and high-density oligonucleotide microarray for gene expression profiling and chromosomal alterations. Results We identified 67 differentially expressed genes in the patients with and without the chromosome 13 deletion, all of which were downregulated in the cases with Delta(13) : 44 mapped along the whole chromosome 13, seven on chromosome 11 and three on chromosome 19. Functional analyses of the selected genes indicated their involvement in protein biosynthesis, ubiquitination and transcriptional regulation. An integrative genomic approach based on regional analyses of the gene expression data identified distinct chromosomal regions whose global expression modulation could differentiate Delta(13) -positive cases, in particular the upregulation of 1 q 21 - 1 q 42 and the downregulation of 19 p and almost the entire chromosome 11. FISH analyses confirmed the close relationship between Delta(13) -positivity and the presence of extra copies of 1 q 21 - 1 q 42 (p= 6 x 10 (- 4)) or the absence of chromosome 11 and 19 <b>trisomy</b> (p= 5 <b>x</b> 10 (- 4)). Interpretation and Conclusions Our results indicate that distinct types of chromosomal aberrations are closely related to the transcriptional profiles of Delta(13) -positive cases, suggesting that the contribution of Delta(13) to the malignancy should be considered together with associated abnormalities...|$|R

The co-occurrence with the Tourette syndrome in two of our families, and the fact that both Rett and Tourette syndrome are associated with movement disorders, possible dopaminergic hypersensitivity and increased chromosomal fragility in subsets of fragile sites, may suggest a possible avenue for further research. The cytogenetic findings indicate that both X- linked and autosomal regulatory region(s) may be part of a complex genetic alteration in association with Rett syndrome. Articl...|$|E
40|$|Background and aims: The {{obstetric care}} of a pregnancy, as it is practiced today, {{includes}} non-invasive screening approaches as well as invasive procedures for the definitive prenatal diagnosis of fetal disorders correlations between indications for prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis and results of the chromo-somal analysis made upon fetal cells. The aim of our study was to evaluate {{the correlations between the}} screening test results and results of chromosomal analysis on fetal cells. Methods: Amniotic fluid samples from 1159 pregnant women were studied with the rapid FISH method and the cytogenetic analysis (karyotype). The results from both methods were compared. Results: The indications to perform prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis for numerical chromosomal ab-normalities were: abnormal results of double or triple test, advanced maternal age, fetal abnormality detected through ultrasound examination, and positive family history for chromosomal anomalies. In our study we identified 30 cases with abnormal numeric chromosomes (18 cases of trisomy 21, 4 cases of trisomy 18, 3 cases of <b>trisomy</b> <b>X,</b> 1 case of monosomy, 2 cases of trisomy XYY, 1 case of trisomy XXY and 1 case of triploidy). Conclusions: This report confirms the importance of screening and the cytogenetic diagnosis in the identification of the numerical chromosomal abnormalities...|$|E
