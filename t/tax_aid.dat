40|$|This report {{identifies}} the 11 Long Island districts {{with the most}} student poverty and compares them with the 11 districts with middle student poverty, and the 11 districts with the least student poverty. In addition to poverty, this report looks at the demographic composition of these districts, and percentage of English language learners. Historically on Long Island, as elsewhere, {{there has been a}} large funding gap between school districts with high poverty and those with little poverty. The funding gap, as examined by The Education Trust and others, documents the difference in educational opportunity between school districts. In order to make this calculation it is necessary to both examine expenditures per pupil and student need (as measured by the proportion of student poverty). Policy makers and researchers across the spectrum agree that it generally costs more to provide equivalent educational opportunity to students from poor households as those from middle class or wealthier households. This report factors student poverty into the measurement of the funding gap. The report examines the effectiveness since 2007 of different state school aid categories at closing the funding gap [...] specifically looking at foundation aid, high <b>tax</b> <b>aid</b> and all state operating aid as a whole. In addition, this report looks at student outcomes according to 8 th grade English Language Arts and Math exams, graduation rates, Regents diploma rates, and college enrollment rates in order to evaluate whether there has been progress at closing the achievement gaps since funding reforms were instituted...|$|E
40|$|The {{distinction}} between developing and developed countries {{has long been}} central to development studies and to debates on development policy. In earlier decades, it was in many respects accurate, and was for many purposes useful. Although the world {{is still very much}} divided between rich and poor countries, relationships among countries have changed so much that the developing– developed country distinction has become an obstacle to understanding current problems and opportunities and, even more, to thinking productively about the future. It is time to stop using it. Many alternative ways of categorising countries have been suggested. In recent years in particular, large numbers of organisations have begun annually to rank countries according {{to a wide variety of}} criteria: from economic vulnerability, bribe payers, competitiveness, digital access, ease of doing business, food insecurity, governance, and happiness to water poverty and welfare. These do not adequately capture the structural and relational changes that have occurred in our multi-polar world with substantially altered flows of ideas, resources and influence. Focusing on the needs of European policymakers, this paper suggests two axes for classifying countries. The first is the external capacity of states to influence and work with other states. This is captured in the (measureable) concept of ‘anchor countries’ developed by the German Development Institute and beginning to be put into practice in the enlargement from the G 8 to the G 20. The second is internal state capacity, as shaped by the sources of government income, in particular contrasting <b>tax,</b> <b>aid,</b> and oil. Using sources of public revenue as a way of classifying countries requires more work but would help to steer the development debate toward the key issue of improving the quality of governance and thus strengthening the capacity of poor countries to help themselves.

This paper compares the legislative processes that France and Spain countries followed in this matter. In both cases politicians’ arguments for and against progressive taxation were similar, and backed by well-known economic ideas and authors. The process in France was leaded by a majority of MPs believing that progressive <b>taxes</b> <b>aided</b> in the achievement of real justice in taxpaying. In Spain, there was not this majority, but the reform passed due to other circumstances.

40|$|Households who save in {{anticipation}} of their child’s college expenses reduce their child’s eligibility for financial aid. The penalty of reduced financial aid eligibility acts as an implicit tax on household assets. At the same time, the federal algorithm used to compute the financial aid {{does not take into}} consideration the assets accumulated in retirement accounts or as home equity. Households can diminish their marginal financial <b>aid</b> <b>tax</b> rates by moving funds into retirement accounts or by increasing their home equity. Using the 2001 Survey of Consumer Finances, this study investigates the effect of the college financial aid rules on household portfolio choices. Our results show that households who have higher marginal financial <b>aid</b> <b>tax</b> rates have higher retirement assets and home equity compared to their taxable financial assets.

This paper reexamines the relationship between <b>aid</b> and domestic <b>tax</b> revenues using a more recent and comprehensive dataset covering 118 countries for the period 1980 – 2009. Overall, our results support earlier findings of a negative association between net Official Development Assistance (ODA) and domestic tax revenues, but this relationship appears to have weakened in reflection of greater efforts at mobilizing domestic revenues in many countries. The composition of net ODA matters: ODA grants are associated with lower revenues, while ODA loans are not. The paper further finds that net ODA and grants are negatively associated with VAT, excise and income tax revenues, but have a positive relationship with trade <b>taxes.</b> <b>Aid</b> has a particularly strong negative effect on domestic tax revenues in low-income countries and incountries with relatively wea...|$|R
5000|$|Duties owed by a vassal to his lord can be {{categorised}} {{into four}} types: military (auxilium), court duties (consilium), special <b>taxes</b> (<b>aids)</b> and incidents. Military duties included personal service, providing troops (raising levies), and later scutage {{in lieu of}} service. Military duties also included work on fortifications and roads and bridges, thus the trinoda necessitas. [...] Court duties encompassed everything from security (being a guard) through rendering advice in council, providing squires and even in some cases providing de facto hostages. Aids, often called feudal aids, were monies due upon certain contingent events, such as contributing to the lord's ransom, or to pageant-like events at court such as royal marriages. [...] Incidents included such things as a negotiated kickback to the lord upon being granted a fief (politely called a receipt), the duty to feed and house the lord and his retinue when the lord visited (droit de gîte), allowing the lord to hunt or fish on his land (droit de garenne) and being subject to the residual lordly rights of guardianship upon minority inheritance, and forfeiture upon a failure of heirs or failure to observe his feudal obligations.|$|R
