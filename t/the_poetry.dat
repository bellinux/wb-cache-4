5|$|However, the {{aesthetic}} involved with <b>the</b> <b>poetry</b> goes much farther {{back in time}} and is used much more subtly than these examples suggest. Beyond issues of adaptation of text to film, Kiarostami often begins with an insistent will to give visual embodiment to certain specific image-making techniques in Persian poetry, both classical and contemporary, and often ends up enunciating a larger philosophical position, namely the ontological oneness of poetry and film.|$|E
5|$|In Norse mythology, Sif is {{a goddess}} {{associated}} with earth. Sif is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, {{written in the}} 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in <b>the</b> <b>poetry</b> of skalds.

5|$|In his Poetics, Aristotle {{points to}} the ″voice of the shuttle″ in Sophocles′ tragedy Tereus {{as an example of}} a poetic device that aids in the ″recognition″—the change from ignorance to knowledge—of what has {{happened}} earlier in the plot. Such a device, according to Aristotle, is ″contrived″ by the poet, and thus is ″inartistic.″. The connection between the nightingale's song and poetry is evoked by Aristophanes in his comedy The Birds and in <b>the</b> <b>poetry</b> of Callimachus. Roman poet Virgil compares the mourning of Orpheus for Eurydice to the “lament of the nightingale”.|$|E
5|$|Khan {{was born}} on 15 July 1914 in Agra. He was among the four sons and three daughters of Khansaahib Ameer Ahmed Khan and Mehmoodah Begum.

In his early age, Khan's mother introduced him to <b>the</b> <b>poetry</b> of Maulana Hali and Muhammad Iqbal, the sermons of Abul Kalam Azad, and the Sufist philosophy of Rumi. This upbringing influenced his interest in historical as well as contemporary social, economic, and political affairs.|$|E
5|$|Latin {{writers were}} {{immersed}} in the Greek literary tradition, and adapted its forms and much of its content, but Romans regarded satire as a genre in which they surpassed the Greeks. Horace wrote verse satires before fashioning himself as an Augustan court poet, and the early Principate also produced the satirists Persius and Juvenal. <b>The</b> <b>poetry</b> of Juvenal offers a lively curmudgeon's perspective on urban society.|$|E
