5|$|After {{leaving the}} major labels, Black Lab {{essentially}} ceased touring, fearing that a self-booked and promoted national tour {{would not be}} cost-effective. <b>They</b> <b>maintained</b> a relationship with fans via their website and MP3 of the Month Club, through which users were able to subscribe to monthly tracks of new content, such as soundtrack songs, unreleased works, and insights into the band's songwriting process.|$|E
5|$|In July 1943, the Montenegrin Partisan leader Đilas {{contacted}} both Ostojić and Baćović {{to establish}} their willingness to work jointly against the Axis occupiers, given that a new government-in-exile {{was about to be}} established without Mihailović.

5|$|By 28 February 1943, 2,807 of the 8,137 Chetniks {{operating}} in northern Dalmatia {{as part of}} the Italian Anti-Communist Volunteer Militia (MVAC) XVIIth Corps were under Baćović's command. In July 1943, Montenegrin Partisan leader Milovan Đilas contacted both Baćović and Ostojić to establish their willingness to work jointly against the Germans and Italians, given that a new Yugoslav government-in-exile was about to be established in London without Mihailović. Baćović and Ostojić reported this contact to Mihailović who threatened to exclude them from his Chetnik organization if <b>they</b> <b>maintained</b> contact with the Partisans.|$|E

5|$|In 1469 Shetland {{came under}} nominal Scottish control, {{although}} the Norse 'Lairds of Norway' kept their Papa Stour estates until the 17th century. In the 16th century merchants from Bremen and Hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy {{fish from the}} local fleet. By the 18th century, two Scottish lairds, Thomas Gifford of Busta, and Arthur Nicolson of Lerwick, owned the island. <b>They</b> <b>maintained</b> a prosperous Haaf (Old Norse: 'deep sea') fishing industry, undertaken in the summer months using six-oared boats known as sixareens.|$|E
5|$|The {{performers}} {{were allowed}} to improvise provided that <b>they</b> <b>maintained</b> factual accuracy. Howick said that improvisation was actually often necessary due to the rapid-fire pace of filming, which left very little {{time to prepare for}} individual roles. On the other hand, both Rickard and Baynton suggest this enforced spontaneity may have ultimately worked to enhance the comedy, not least by preventing the jokes from becoming over-rehearsed.|$|E
5|$|<b>They</b> <b>maintained</b> {{that the}} {{potassium}} tartrate {{used in his}} treatment prevented his stomach from expelling these compounds and that his thirst was {{a symptom of the}} poison. Their hypothesis was that the calomel given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left extensive tissue damage behind. According to a 2007 article, the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral, the most toxic, and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion that he was murdered.|$|E

5|$|Though <b>they</b> <b>maintained</b> {{a formal}} {{neutrality}} policy {{in regards to}} religion, the French colonial administration began to regulate Islamic education in the early 1900s. In addition, fear of a pan-Islamism political rise throughout North Africa and the Sahel led the French to adopt policies that aimed {{to prevent the spread}} of Islam beyond where it already existed and to prevent Muslim leaders from governing non-Muslim communities. Indigenous religions and Christianity existed under less formal policies, and French efforts often used these to balance the spread of Islam in the region.|$|E
5|$|Within {{two years}} the Boston {{membership}} had exceeded the original church's capacity. By 1903 the block around the church had been purchased by Christian Scientists, and in 1906 the Mother Church Extension, accommodating 5,000 people, was completed {{at a cost of}} $2 million. This attracted the criticism that, whereas Christian Scientists spent money on a magnificent church, <b>they</b> <b>maintained</b> no hospitals, orphanages or missions in the slums.|$|E
5|$|Ashot III {{established}} the Kingdom of Lori (Tashir-Dzoraget Kingdom) in Gugark for strategic reasons and enthroned Gurgen in 982. Gurgen {{along with his}} brother Smbat are depicted on the sculptures of the patrons in both Sanahin and Haghpat. When the Tashir-Dzoraget kingdom fell {{as a result of}} Seljuk raids the Kyurikids migrated to Tavush and Metsnaberd yet <b>they</b> <b>maintained</b> ties with their ancestral fortress and compound in Akhtala. The fortress was built on an elevated rocky outcrop surrounded by deep canyons from three sides forming a natural protection. The somewhat accessible parts between the cliffs are reinforced by towers and walls. The only entrance to the compound is on the northern side protected by bell-shaped towers and walls. The walls and towers of the fortress are built of bluish basalt and lime mortar. The Kyurikids gradually lost their influence under the Seljuk grasp {{by the end of the}} 12th century.|$|E

5|$|Gary and Veronica Cooper's daughter, Maria Veronica Cooper, {{was born}} on September 15, 1937. By all accounts, he was a patient and affectionate father, {{teaching}} Maria to ride a bicycle, play tennis, ski, and ride horses. Sharing many of her parents' interests, she accompanied them on their travels and was often photographed with them. Like her father, she developed a love for art and drawing. As a family they vacationed together in Sun Valley, Idaho, spent time at Rocky's parents' country house in Southampton, New York, and took frequent trips to Europe. Cooper and Rocky were legally separated on May 16, 1951, when Cooper moved out of their home. For over two years, <b>they</b> <b>maintained</b> a fragile and uneasy family life with their daughter. Cooper moved back into their home in November 1953, and their formal reconciliation occurred in February 1954.|$|E
5|$|In 1341–1347 the Byzantine Empire was {{plunged into}} a {{protracted}} civil war between the regency for Emperor John V Palaiologos under Anna of Savoy and his intended guardian John VI Kantakouzenos. The neighbours of the Byzantines {{took advantage of the}} civil war, and while Stefan Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia sided with John VI Kantakouzenos, Ivan Alexander backed John V Palaiologos and his regency. Although the two Balkan rulers picked opposite sides in the Byzantine civil war, <b>they</b> <b>maintained</b> their alliance with each other. As the price for Ivan Alexander's support, the regency for John V Palaiologos ceded him the city of Philippopolis (Plovdiv) and nine important fortresses in the Rhodope Mountains in 1344. This peaceful turnover constituted the last major success of Ivan Alexander's foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|In 1938 Vaughan Williams met Ursula Wood (1911–2007), {{the wife}} of an army officer, Captain (later Lieutenant-Colonel) Michael Forrester Wood. She was a poet, and had {{approached}} the composer with a proposed scenario for a ballet. Despite their both being married, and a four-decade age-gap, {{they fell in love}} almost from their first meeting; <b>they</b> <b>maintained</b> a secret love affair for more than a decade. Ursula became the composer's muse, helper and London companion, and later helped him care for his ailing wife. Whether Adeline knew, or suspected, that Ursula and Vaughan Williams were lovers is uncertain, but the relations between the two women were of warm friendship throughout the years they knew each other. The composer's concern for his first wife never faltered, according to Ursula, who admitted in the 1980s that she had been jealous of Adeline, whose place in Vaughan Williams's life and affections was unchallengeable.|$|E

5|$|In 753, {{when the}} Rashtrakutas {{replaced}} the Badami Chalukyas {{as the dominant}} force in the Deccan, the Gangas offered stiff resistance for about a century. King Shivamara II is mostly known for his wars with the Rashtrakuta Dhruva Dharavarsha, his subsequent defeat and imprisonment, his release from prison and eventually his death on the battle field. The Ganga resistance continued through the reign of Rashtrakuta Govinda III and by 819, a Ganga resurgence gained them partial control over Gangavadi under King Rachamalla. Seeing the futility of waging war with the Western Ganga, Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha I gave his daughter Chandrabbalabbe in marriage to Ganga prince Butuga I, son of King Ereganga Neetimarga. The Gangas thereafter became staunch allies of the Rashtrakutas, a position <b>they</b> <b>maintained</b> {{till the end of}} the Rashtrakuta dynasty of Manyakheta.|$|E
5|$|On June 30, 1891, Cornwell married Nannie V. Dellinger (1869–1893) of Middletown, Virginia. They had two {{children}} before her death on June 29, 1893. Cornwell's second marriage was to Sophie H. Colston (1878–1928) in Martinsburg, West Virginia on June 14, 1899. She {{was the daughter of}} W. B. Colston and his wife Minnie Colston of Martinsburg. Cornwell relocated to Fairmont in 1902, and engaged in the practice of law there. In 1906, lawyer Raymond J. Abbaticchio arrived in Fairmont and entered Cornwell's law office and later became a junior member of the law firm of Cornwell & Abbaticchio. <b>They</b> <b>maintained</b> their partnership until Cornwell's departure from Fairmont in 1910.|$|E
5|$|Riou {{worked closely}} with Parker's second-in-command, Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson, and Captain Thomas Foley in the lead-up to the Battle of Copenhagen, and Nelson duly {{appointed}} Riou commander of the frigates and smaller vessels, instructing Rious to deploy his ships {{in support of the}} main fleet. As the battle began, several of Nelson's ships of the line ran aground on shoals in the harbour, forcing the improvisation of a new plan of attack. As Nelson's ships engaged their Danish counterparts, Riou took his frigates in to harass the Trekroner Fort and blockships. Although the frigates were heavily outmatched and dangerously exposed, <b>they</b> <b>maintained</b> the engagement for several hours. The ships suffered heavy casualties, and a splinter hit Riou on the head.|$|E

5|$|The Bayreuth {{authorities}} allowed unstaged performances to {{take place}} in various countries after Wagner's death (London in 1884, New York City in 1886, and Amsterdam in 1894) but <b>they</b> <b>maintained</b> an embargo on stage performances outside Bayreuth. On 24 December 1903, after receiving a court ruling that performances in the United States could not be prevented by Bayreuth, the New York Metropolitan Opera staged the complete opera, using many Bayreuth-trained singers. Cosima barred anyone involved in the New York production from working at Bayreuth in future performances. Unauthorized stage performances were also undertaken in Amsterdam in 1905, 1906 and 1908. There was a performance in Buenos Aires, in Teatro Coliseo, on June 20, 1913 under Gino Marinuzzi.|$|E
5|$|The Pallittorre's {{numbers have}} been {{estimated}} from as low as 50–60 to as high as 600. <b>They</b> <b>maintained</b> cleared grassy plains by regular careful burning, and used this method also to control undergrowth in the forests. This land management technique enabled easier hunting and food gathering. European colonists noted, after the Pallittorre had been eliminated from the area, how the forests rapidly reclaimed the formerly cleared land. They ranged across the land on a seasonal basis, {{at least as far}} as Mole Creek, and lived in villages of bark huts at times. They mined ochre in the Gog Range, trading this with other aborigines, across Tasmania. The Pallitorre congregated in areas in the Meander area, such as Jackeys Marsh - the name 'jackey' being a colloquial term for aboriginal people.|$|E
5|$|The most {{usual way}} in the 15th century for a patron to {{commission}} a piece was to visit a master's workshop. Only {{a certain number of}} masters could operate within any city's bounds; they were regulated by artisan guilds to whom they had to be affiliated to be allowed to operate and receive commissions. Guilds protected and regulated painting, overseeing production, export trade and raw material supply; and <b>they</b> <b>maintained</b> discrete sets of rules for panel painters, cloth painters and book illuminators. For example, the rules set higher citizenship requirements for miniaturists and prohibited them from using oils. Overall, panel painters enjoyed the highest level of protection, with cloth painters ranking below.|$|E
