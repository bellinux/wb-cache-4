To warn Peter of his impending role, the Fringe Division work with biotechnology corporation Massive Dynamic to come up with a way to cross over. They form a plan that takes advantage of Olivia's universe-hopping ability, and recruit three other Cortexiphan test subjects who have unique abilities: Nick Lane (David Call), Sally Clark (Pascale Hutton), and James Heath (Omar Metwally), two of whom appeared in previous episodes. The team—composed of Walter, Olivia, Nick, Sally, and James—successfully arrives on the Other Side. James dies shortly after arrival, but the rest manage to escape the alternate reality's Fringe Division, who had used their special technology to detect their arrival. It is revealed that Walternate is the Secretary of Defense on the Other Side.|$|E

2500|$|The manga (and the {{subsequent}} anime television series) The Vision of Escaflowne {{takes place in}} a world, Gaea, mirrored <b>to</b> <b>ours</b> where Atlanteans were a race of winged people who fell in some catastrophic event.

[...] One of the main characters, Van, is said to have descended from the people of Atlantis. The people of Atlantis, also referred to as the Draconians or Dragon People (ryū-jin), were responsible for creating the mystical world of Gaea using the power of wishes, and the story of Escaflowne revolves largely around Emperor Dornkirk's attempt to regain that power. Note that the film version of Escaflowne does not involve Atlantis in any way.|$|E

"After {{stating the}} {{constitutional}} reasons against a public establishment of any religious instruction, we suggest the expediency of encouraging the different religious sects to establish, each for itself, a professorship {{of their own}} tenets on {{the confines of the}} university, so near as that their students may attend the lectures there and have the free use of our library and every other accommodation we can give them; preserving, however, their independence of us and of each other.

2500|$|Greek numerals {{were used}} by Archimedes, Diophantus and others in a {{positional}} notation not very different from ours.

Their addition algorithm was identical <b>to</b> <b>ours,</b> and their multiplication algorithm was only very slightly different. Their long division algorithm was the same, and the square root algorithm that was once taught in school was known to Archimedes, who may have invented it.

2500|$|I {{have always}} been {{of the opinion that}} we have no right to impose our ideals upon other nations, no matter how strange it may seem to us that they enjoy the kind of life they lead, how slow they may be in {{utilizing}} the resources of their countries, or how much opposed their ideals may be <b>to</b> <b>ours</b> ... Our intolerant attitude is most pronounced in regard to what we like to call [...] "our free institutions." [...] Modern democracy was no doubt the most wholesome and needed reaction against the abuses of absolutism and of a selfish, often corrupt, bureaucracy. That the wishes and thoughts of the people should find expression, and that the form of government should conform to these wishis is an axiom that has pervaded the whole Western world, and that is even taking root in the Far East. It is a quite different question, however, in how far the particular machinery of democratic government is identical with democratic institutions ... To claim as we often do, that our solution is the only democratic and the ideal one is a one-sided expression of Americanism. I see no reason why we should not allow the Germans, Austrians, and Russians, or whoever else it may be, to solve their problems in their own ways, instead of demanding that they bestow upon themselves the benefactions of our regime.|$|E
2500|$|The attack {{began on}} 22 June. Despite ample warning from {{intelligence}} sources and defectors, Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Command were caught by surprise, and the Germans rapidly {{broke through the}} frontier defences, helped by their total command of the air. But the Soviet commander in northern Ukraine, Colonel-General Mikhail Kirponos, {{was one of the}} better Soviet generals, and he commanded the Red Army's largest and best-equipped force: nearly a million men and 4,800 tanks. The Germans soon encountered stubborn resistance. Rundstedt testified at Nuremberg: [...] "The resistance at the frontier was not too great, but it grew continually as we advanced into the interior of the country. Very strong tank forces, tanks of a better type, far superior <b>to</b> <b>ours,</b> appeared." [...] The Soviet tank armies were in fact stronger than the German panzer divisions, and in the T-34 they possessed a superior tank: Kleist called it [...] "the finest tank in the world." [...] Rundstedt said after the war: [...] "I realised soon after the attack that everything that had been written about Russia was wrong." [...] But {{at this stage of the}} war the Red Army tank commanders lacked the tactical skill and experience of the German panzer commanders, and after ten days of bitter fighting Kleist's armour broke through, reaching Zhitomir, only 130km from Kiev, on 12 July. By 30 July the Red Army in Ukraine was in full retreat. Rundstedt and his commanders were confident that they could seize Kiev [...] "off the march," [...] that is, without a prolonged siege.|$|E
2500|$|In the 17th century, Racine {{expressed}} {{admiration for}} Sophocles but was more influenced by Euripides (e.g. Iphigenia at Aulis and Hippolytus were the models for his plays Iphigénie and Phèdre). Euripides' reputation {{was to take}} a beating early in the 19th century when Friedrich Schlegel and his brother August Wilhelm Schlegel championed Aristotle's 'biological' model of theatre history, identifying Euripides with the moral, political and artistic degeneration of Athens. August Wilhelm's Vienna lectures on dramatic art and literature went through four editions between 1809 and 1846 and, in them, he opined that Euripides [...] "not only destroyed the external order of tragedy but missed its entire meaning," [...] a view that came to influence Friedrich Nietzsche, who however {{seems not to have}} known the Euripidean plays at all well. However literary figures such as the poet Robert Browning and his wife Elizabeth Barrett Browning could study and admire the Schlegels while still appreciating Euripides as [...] "our Euripides the human" [...] (Wine of Cyprus stanza 12). [...] Classicists such as Arthur Verrall and Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff reacted against the views of the Schlegels and Nietzsche, constructing arguments sympathetic to Euripides, which involved Wilamowitz in this restatement of Greek tragedy as a genre: [...] "A [...] tragedy does not have to end 'tragically' or be 'tragic'. The only requirement is a serious treatment." [...] In the English-speaking world, the pacifist Gilbert Murray {{played an important role in}} popularizing Euripides, influenced perhaps by his anti-war plays. Today, as in the time of Euripides, traditional assumptions are constantly under challenge and audiences therefore have a natural affinity with the Euripidean outlook which seems nearer <b>to</b> <b>ours</b> for example than the Elizabethan. As stated above, however, opinions continue to diverge, so that one recent critic might dismiss the debates in Euripides' plays as [...] "self-indulgent digression for the sake of rhetorical display" [...] and another springs to the poet's defence in terms such as: [...] "His plays are remarkable for their range of tones and the gleeful inventiveness, which morose critics call cynical artificiality, of their construction." ...|$|E

Just before Colonel Campbell became so very ill, we had decided to kill and eat it, when one morning Johnny ran in and said, 'Oh, mamma, the white hen has laid an egg!' We took it at once to Colonel Campbell, it being a great luxury in those days. The hen laid one every day for him till he died, and then ceased for the rest of the siege; but we would not kill it then.
