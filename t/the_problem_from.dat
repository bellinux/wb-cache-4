People of the time would spit on their chest believing that this would keep <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>from</b> affected them. According to Apuleius and other ancient physicians, in order detect epilepsy it was common to light a piece of gagates, whose smoke would trigger the seizure. Occasionally a spinning potter's wheel was used, perhaps a reference to photosensitive epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{began to}} address <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>from</b> 1649 onwards, {{but it was}} slow to make a difference. Helen Small writes that, under George III (reigned 1760–1820), new {{legislation}} prevented debts of under 40shillings leading to jail (£ in 2014), but even the smallest debt would exceed that once lawyers' fees were added. Under the Insolvent Debtors Act 1813, debtors could request release after 14days by taking an oath that their assets did not exceed £20, but if a creditor objected they had to stay inside. Even after years in prison, the debt remained to be paid.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the results}} of this {{experiment}} were accurate, Fricke misinterpreted the data to mean that the cell membrane is a single molecular layer. Prof. Dr. Evert Gorter (1881–1954) and F. Grendel of Leiden University approached <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>from</b> a different perspective, spreading the erythrocyte lipids as a monolayer on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared the area of the monolayer to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses showed several errors and incorrect assumptions with this experiment but, serendipitously, these errors canceled out and from this flawed data Gorter and Grendel drew the correct conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer.|$|E

25|$|Newton {{and others}} before Pierre-Simon Laplace worked <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>from</b> the {{perspective}} of a static system (equilibrium theory), that provided an approximation that described the tides that would occur in a non-inertial ocean evenly covering the whole Earth. The tide-generating force (or its corresponding potential) is still relevant to tidal theory, but as an intermediate quantity (forcing function) rather than as a final result; theory must also consider the Earth's accumulated dynamic tidal response to the applied forces, which response is influenced by ocean depth, the Earth's rotation, and other factors.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of more sophisticated SAMs such as the MIM-104 Patriot and the US Navy's Aegis combat system {{put pressure on the}} Soviets to develop better ARMs in turn. Zvezda came at <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>from</b> a different angle to Raduga, having a background in lightweight air-to-air missiles. However, in the mid-1970s they had developed the successful Kh-25 family of short-range air-to-surface missiles, including the Kh-25MP (AS-12 'Kegler') for anti-radar use. Zvezda started work on a long-range ARM and the first launch of the Kh-31 was in 1982.

25|$|Tax evasion {{has long}} saddled Argentina's public finances, {{shifting}} the burden {{to the middle}} and working classes by way of high value-added taxes (which are easier to collect). Improvements in enforcement since the 1990s have abated <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>from</b> its peak in the 1980s, when fully half of all tax liabilities (and most income taxes) were evaded. Nevertheless, Hernán Arbizu, a former JP Morgan Chase executive, testified in 2013 and 2014 on how Argentine firms and wealthy Argentine clients still evade {{billions of dollars in}} taxes using local banks and exchange houses. Among those implicated were the Clarín Media Group; energy firm Petrobras Argentina; electricity distributor Edesur; the late María Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat and her executor, Congressman Alfonso Prat-Gay; former YPF head Sebastián Eskenazi; and the late television host Bernardo Neustadt.|$|E
25|$|One {{approach}} considers <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>from</b> {{the perspective}} of who benefits most from the public good. This approach is sensitive {{to the fact that}} different preferences exist between different income classes. The public good is viewed in a similar way as a private good, where those who use the public good must pay for it. Some people will benefit more from the public good than others, thus creating inequalities in the absence of benefit taxes. A difficulty with public goods is determining who exactly benefits from the public good, although some estimates of the distribution of {{the costs and benefits of}} global warming have been made – see above. Additionally, this approach does not provide guidance as to how the surplus of benefits from climate policy should be shared.|$|E

25|$|Thus, by {{the early}} twentieth century the chemical, but not the {{structural}} nature of the cell membrane was known. Two experiments in 1924 laid the groundwork to fill in this gap. By measuring the capacitance of erythrocyte solutions Fricke determined that the cell membrane was 3.3nm thick. Although the results of this experiment were accurate, Fricke misinterpreted the data to mean that the cell membrane is a single molecular layer. Because the polar lipid headgroups are fully hydrated, they do not show up in a capacitance measurement meaning that this experiment actually measured the thickness of the hydrocarbon core, not the whole bilayer. Gorter and Grendel approached <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>from</b> a different perspective, performing a solvent extraction of erythrocyte lipids and spreading the resulting material as a monolayer on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared the area of the monolayer to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses of this experiment showed several problems including an incorrect monolayer pressure, incomplete lipid extraction and a miscalculation of cell surface area. In spite of these issues the fundamental conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer- was correct.|$|E

2500|$|A third {{approach}} {{looks at}} <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>from</b> {{the perspective of}} who has contributed most to the problem.

This stock of emissions has been described as an [...] "environmental debt" [...] (Munasinghe et al., 1996, p.167). In terms of efficiency, this view is not supported. This is because efficiency requires incentives to be forward-looking, and not retrospective (Goldemberg et al., 1996, p.29). The question of historical responsibility is a matter of ethics. Munasinghe et al. (1996, p.167) suggested that developed countries could address the issue by making side-payments to developing countries.|$|E
