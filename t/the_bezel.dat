5|$|In {{addition}} to fueling Hero actions, Bezels {{act as a}} safeguard to character defeat. Characters will not receive any direct damage {{as long as there}} is at least one Bezel. If there are enough Bezels remaining, receiving damage that would otherwise defeat the character instead causes the character to be knocked into the air and <b>the</b> <b>Bezel</b> is shattered into shards that scatter across the battlefield. If the player does not have any Bezels remaining, the characters go into critical mode. Critical mode causes the characters to become extremely scared, leaving them unable to shoot quickly, unable to use Hero actions, and taking direct damage from every attack. Four Bezel Shards must be collected by the characters in order to restore a Bezel and replenish their power, and enemies can even pick up Bezel Shards to regenerate health and shields. The game ends if any character is killed and there are no intact Bezels to protect them.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the most}} plunderable portables from the Etruscan tombs of Etruria are the finely {{engraved}} gemstones set in patterned gold to form circular or ovoid pieces intended {{to go on}} finger rings. Of the magnitude of one centimeter, they are dated to the Etruscan floruit from {{the second half of}} the sixth to the first centuries BC. The two main theories of manufacture are native Etruscan and Greek. The materials are mainly dark red carnelian, with agate and sard entering usage from the third to the first centuries BC, along with purely gold finger rings with a hollow engraved bezel setting. The engravings, mainly cameo, but sometimes intaglio, depict scarabs at first and then scenes from Greek mythology, often with heroic personages called out in Etruscan. The gold setting of <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> bears a border design, such as cabling.|$|E

500|$|The G2's {{exterior}} {{consists of}} a polycarbonate shell—unlike its predecessor, which used a glass-based construction. The rear cover is adorned with a subtle pattern resembling carbon fiber. The G2's volume and power keys are located directly below the camera on {{the rear of the}} device. The power button contains an LED lamp, which {{can be used as a}} notification light. The positioning of the buttons on the rear deviates from the majority of smartphones, where they are located on <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> (side edge) of the phone. LG argued that buttons located on <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> were harder to reach on larger smartphones, and made it more likely for users to drop their phone when adjusting the volume during a call. As such, the G2's buttons are instead located where the index finger would normally lie when the phone is held. Alongside the power button, the G2 is also [...] powered on by double-tapping on the screen, and turned off by double-tapping on the status bar or a blank area on the home screen, a feature branded as [...] "KnockOn". When the phone is off, the volume keys can also be used to launch directly into the camera or QuickMemo applications by holding them down.|$|E

30|$|This can be {{observed}} by comparing the DSIS scores for Figures 10 (a)– 10 (c) to those from Figures 10 (d)– 10 (f), respectively. In general, people prefer a tiled display with smaller or no bezels. Our results show that a tiled display system which has bezels can allow a more lax synchronization among tiles compared to one without <b>bezels.</b> <b>The</b> results in terms of lower distortion visibility for <b>the</b> <b>bezels</b> case corresponds well with that from standard spatial vernier acuity threshold elevation as gap width increases.|$|R
3000|$|In {{a typical}} tiled display system, each panel {{may have a}} bezel (mullion). Typically, tile bezels may be black/dark in color, as seen in Figure 2. When {{displaying}} the overall image, <b>the</b> tile <b>bezels</b> behave {{in a manner similar}} to occluding virtual pixels underneath them. Thus, the middleware removes those pixels which fall [...] "underneath" [...] <b>the</b> tile <b>bezels.</b> This helps humans perceive the overall displayed image as natural (such as seen through a French window). Thus, circles stay as circles and not as ellipses. Similarly, a human face retains its proportion. In this paper, <b>the</b> tile <b>bezel</b> width is treated as a occlusion and is referred to as gap width.|$|R
2500|$|The letters [...] "IHTFP" [...] {{have been}} {{featured}} prominently on some hacks, but are more usually subtly embedded within other hacks as an inside joke.

2500|$|The gold finger-rings {{could have}} been worn by either men or women, though the bracelets, and {{necklaces}} with pendants were chiefly feminine jewels at this date. [...] Many of the rings display elaborate filigree work, typical of late-Roman taste, and a few are of highly unusual design. [...] The tiny horned, Pan-like head that forms <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> of ring no.23 appears to be unparalleled, and may well be intended as a reference to Faunus, while the design of no.7, two birds flanking a vase, is both a standard Bacchic image, eventually adopted in Christian iconography, and possibly something more specific in this instance. [...] The birds, {{even though they are}} at a very small scale, have the appearance of woodpeckers, and picus, the Latin name for birds of this kind, was also {{the name of the father}} of Faunus in some sources (Virgil, Aeneid 7, 48).|$|E

60|$|She {{was again}} left alone, and, as it still wanted {{some time to}} Nicholas's appointment, she stood by the fire, looking {{at herself in the}} glass over the mantel. Reflectively raising a lock of her hair just above her temple she {{uncovered}} a small scar. That scar had a history. The terrible temper of her late husband--those sudden moods of irascibility which had made even his friendly excitements look like anger--had once caused him to set that mark upon her with <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> of a ring he wore. He declared that the whole thing was an accident. She was a woman, and kept her own opinion.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{smiling in}} her quiet fashion, his mother drew from {{the bosom of}} her robe some object that was wrapped in linen and, {{touching}} her forehead with the royal seal that fastened it, gave it to Rames.

It was massive and of plain gold, and upon <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> of it was cut {{the symbol of the}} sun, on either side of which knelt {{a man and a woman}} crowned with the double crown of Egypt, and holding in their right hands the looped Sign of Life which they stretched up towards the glory of the sun.|$|E
60|$|As I {{remained}} curious I made {{an opportunity}} to scramble {{to the bottom of}} one of these craters, taking with me some of the natives with their wooden tools. Here I found a good deal of soil either washed down from the surface or resulting from the decomposition of the rock, though oddly enough in it nothing grew. I directed them to dig. After a while to my astonishment there appeared a corner of a great worked stone quite unlike that of the crater, indeed it {{seemed to me to be}} a marble. Further examination showed that this block was most beautifully carved in bas-relief, apparently with a design of leaves and flowers. In the disturbed soil also I picked up a life-sized marble hand of a woman exquisitely finished and apparently broken from a statue that might have been the work of one of the great Greek sculptors. Moreover, on the third finger of this hand was a representation of a ring whereof, unfortunately, <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> had been destroyed.|$|E

40|$|International audienceUsing tiled {{monitors}} {{to build}} wall-sized displays has multiple advantages: higher pixel density, simpler setup and easier calibration. However, the resulting display walls {{suffer from the}} visual discontinuity caused by <b>the</b> <b>bezels</b> that frame each monitor. To avoid introducing distortion, the image has to be rendered as if some pixels were drawn behind <b>the</b> <b>bezels.</b> In turn, this raises the issue that a non-negligible part of the rendered image, that might contain important information, is visually occluded. We propose to draw upon the analogy to french windows that {{is often used to}} describe this approach, and make the display really behave as if the visualization were observed through a french window. We present and evaluate two interaction techniques that let users reveal content hidden behind bezels. ePan enables users to offset the entire image through explicit touch gestures. GridScape adopts a more implicit approach: it makes the grid formed by bezels act like a true french window using head tracking to simulate motion parallax, adapting to users' physical movements in front of the display. The two techniques work for both single- and multiple-user contexts...|$|R

50|$|A cabochon stone, a {{gemstone}} {{that is not}} faceted, usually {{relies on}} the shallow angle cut {{into the side of}} the stone which helps the metal to stay in place.
