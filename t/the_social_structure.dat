5|$|Little says Rosenberg was {{influenced}} by Erich Fromm, George Albee, and George Miller to adopt a community focus in his work, moving away from clinical psychological practice. The central ideas influencing this shift by Rosenberg were that: (1) individual mental health depends on <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>structure</b> of a community (Fromm), (2) therapists alone are unable to meet the psychological needs of a community (Albee), and (3) knowledge about human behavior will increase if psychology is freely given to the community (Miller).|$|E

5|$|Sociology is the {{scientific}} study of society, including patterns of social relationships, social interaction, and culture. It is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about social order, acceptance, and change. Many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter ranges from the micro-sociology level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E

By the 1880s women in temperance and suffrage movements shifted the boundaries between private and public life in Dallas by pushing their way into politics {{in the name of}} social issues.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to trace {{the relationship between the}} atomistic personality and <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>structures</b> of <b>the</b> Chippewa-Ojibwa cultural-linguistic groups. The selection of this group was determined after an ethnographic survey of the urban Indians of Chicago at the American Indian Center during the summer of 1973. The basic hypothesis of this research is that the atomistic personality, which is a characteristic feature of the Chippewa-Ojibwa, has hindered native development of extensive <b>social</b> <b>structures</b> known historically beyond that of the individual family and that most of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>structures</b> were results of externally initiated forces or influences.

5|$|As {{with many}} of his novels, Balzac {{analyzes}} the influence of history and social status in La Cousine Bette. The book takes places between 1838 and 1846, when the reign of Louis-Philippe reflected and directed significant changes in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>structure.</b> Balzac was a legitimist favoring the House of Bourbon, and idolized Napoleon Bonaparte as a paragon of effective absolutist power. Balzac felt that French society under the House of Orl√©ans lacked strong leadership, and was fragmented by the demands of parliament. He also believed that Catholicism provided guidance for the nation, and that its absence heralded moral decay.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were {{hierarchical}} societies, each {{based on}} ties of allegiance between powerful lords and their immediate followers.

Beneath the king were thegns, nobles, the more powerful of which maintained their own courts and were termed ealdormen. The relationship between kings and their nobles was bound up with military symbolism and the ritual exchange of weapons and armour. Freemen, called churls, formed {{the next level of}} society, often holding land in their own right or controlling businesses in the towns. Geburs, peasants who worked land belonging to a thegn, formed a lower class still. The very lowest class were slaves, who could be bought and sold and who held only minimal rights.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>social</b> <b>structure</b> of the Byzantine Greeks was {{primarily}} {{supported by a}} rural, agrarian base that consisted of the peasantry, and {{a small fraction of}} the poor. These peasants lived within three kinds of settlements: the chorion or village, the agridion or hamlet, and the proasteion or estate. Many civil disturbances that occurred during the time of the Byzantine Empire were attributed to political factions within the Empire rather than to this large popular base. Soldiers among the Byzantine Greeks were at first conscripted amongst the rural peasants and trained on an annual basis. As the Byzantine Empire entered the 11th century, more of the soldiers within the army were either professional men-at-arms or mercenaries.|$|E

On the basis of examples in today's chimpanzee and bonobo societies, Klaus Ebner introduced both patriarchal and matriarchal characters in the novel, Costello and Akshaya. Some of the female characters are very strong and self-conscious, such as Akshaya, who is so firm that even Costello s from her. While political power is controlled by the males, <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>structure</b> seems matrifocal and matrilineal, corresponding to the image of prehistoric societies exhibited by scholars.|$|E
5|$|Although legal {{accounts}} do {{not describe}} {{the course of}} the combat, contemporary chroniclers have left several records of the day's battle. According to the chronicles, the claimants entered the field last and before all present repeated their accusations against the other and swore oaths guaranteeing their honesty before the King, Parlement and God. Before they remounted, the marshal of the duel performed a brief ceremony in which he knighted Jacques Le Gris. This ceremony was traditional before battle but also performed a part in maintaining <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>structure</b> of medieval France. With both men on the same social footing, there would be no defeat of a senior rank by a lesser one. Having been raised to the status of a knight, Sir Jacques regained his horse and the arena was cleared. Both knights were heavily armed and armoured, protected by a hide and wood shield bearing their coat of arms and thick plate armour, riding a heavy warhorse and wielding a lance, longsword, heavy battle axe and long dagger known as a misericordia.|$|E

5|$|From 1848, the {{national}} {{consciousness of the}} local people grew and from 1848 {{to the end of}} the 19th century local Poles and Czechs co-operated, uniting against the Germanizing tendencies of the Austrian Empire, and later of Austria-Hungary. Various Polish clubs were founded. Most schools were Polish, followed by German and Czech. At the end of the century, ethnic tensions appeared as the area's economic significance grew. This growth caused a wave of immigration from Galicia, when about 60,000 people arrived and settled between 1880 and 1910. They settled mainly in the Ostrau region, but also in Zaolzie. The new immigrants were Polish and poor, about half of them being illiterate, and worked mostly in coal mining and metallurgy. For these people, the most important factor was material well-being; they cared little about the homeland from which they had fled, more readily assimilating into the Czech population which was demographically dominant in the Ostrava region in the heart of Czech Silesia. <b>The</b> <b>social</b> <b>structure</b> of the territory was generally divided along ethnic lines. Germans were economically strongest, mostly owners, Czechs were mostly clerks and other officials, and Poles were mostly manual workers, miners, and metallurgists. This structure had changed over time but in 1921 it was still very similar, with 61.5% of Poles working as labourers.|$|E

They rest {{in the shade of}} trees or bushes, and often bed down in the open when weather is cooler. <b>The</b> <b>social</b> <b>structure</b> of the springbok {{is similar to that of}} Thomson's gazelle. Mixed-sex herds or harems have a roughly 3:1 sex ratio; bachelor individuals are also observed. In the mating season, males generally form herds and wander in search of mates. Females live with their offspring in herds, that very rarely include dominant males. Territorial males round up female herds that enter their territories and keep out the bachelors; mothers and juveniles may gather in nursery herds separate from harem and bachelor herds. After weaning, female juveniles stay with their mothers until the birth of their next calves, while males join bachelor groups.|$|E

40|$|Disaster {{management}} officials, {{as well as}} {{the general}} public, are increasingly using social media to communicate. Such usage has resulted in new and emergent social consequences for disaster management and has reformed the roles of its relevant stakeholders. However, the existing literature on social media use in disasters is still preliminary and incomplete, and does not capture <b>the</b> change in <b>social</b> roles that stakeholders have taken and the consequences of the actions that people take in using social media.
