The plan was opposed by President George W. Bush and faced strong opposition in Congress. Restrictions on retirement account allocations were in direct opposition to the contemporaneous movement towards self-directed individual retirement accounts for Social Security.|$|E

The order had previously been sent on December 1, but Davis had apparently ignored it. Both the Air Force and Davis' family had growing concerns that Chinese and Soviet pilots would be gunning for Davis, given his success and fame. By this point, Davis had 12 victories, and the second-highest scoring aces each had 6 victories. Davis was averaging one victory for three missions.|$|E

5|$|This {{mushroom}} is edible {{but very}} peppery. The Italian chef Antonio Carluccio recommends only {{using it to}} add flavour to other mushrooms. It {{has been used as}} a condiment in many countries. The mushroom should be well-cooked before consumption <b>to</b> <b>minimize</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of gastric symptoms; the peppery taste is lost with cooking. In powdered form, it loses its peppery taste quickly. Some guidebooks classify C.piperatus as inedible. Fruit bodies can be used for mushroom dyeing; depending on the mordant used, yellow, orange, or greenish-brown dyes can be made.|$|E
5|$|However, later {{research}} suggests that the initial stability of the implant in bone is a more important determinant of success of implant integration, rather than a certain period of healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the implant is placed in and the number of implants splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand high torque (35 Ncm) and are splinted to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or bone loss between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months. The corollary is that single implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load <b>to</b> <b>minimize</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of initial failure.|$|E

5|$|Open circuit scuba divers by {{definition}} {{are independent of}} surface supply, and must take any gas mixture with them {{that is to be}} used on the dive. However, if they are confident of returning by a specific route, the decompression gas may be stored at appropriate places on that route.

Similar cylinders are carried by the divers when the route back is not secure. They are commonly mounted as sling cylinders, clipped to D-rings at the sides of the diver's harness.|$|E
5|$|Caesar then {{increased}} the number of magistrates who were elected each year, which created a large pool of experienced magistrates, and allowed Caesar to reward his supporters. Caesar even took steps to transform Italy into a province, and to more tightly link the other provinces of the empire into a single, cohesive unit. This process, of ossifying the entire Roman Empire into a single unit, rather than maintaining it as a network of unequal principalities, would ultimately be completed by Caesar's successor, the emperor Augustus. When Caesar returned to Rome in 47 BC, he raised the senate's membership to 900. While the Roman assemblies continued to meet, Caesar submitted all candidates to the assemblies for election, and all bills to the assemblies for enactment, which caused the assemblies to become powerless and unable to oppose him. <b>To</b> <b>minimize</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> that another general might attempt to challenge him, Caesar passed a law which subjected governors to term limits. Near the end of his life, Caesar began to prepare for a war against the Parthian Empire. Since his absence from Rome might limit his ability to install his own Consuls, he passed a law which allowed him to appoint all magistrates in 43 BC, and all Consuls and Tribunes in 42 BC. This, in effect, transformed the magistrates from being representatives of the people to being representatives of the Dictator, and robbed the popular assemblies of much of their remaining influence.|$|E

40|$|Aim:? To {{undertake}} a narrative {{review of the}} impact and pattern of alcohol consumption in young adults with Type 1 diabetes. Methods:? Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, meeting abstracts of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the American Diabetes Association and Diabetes UK, Current Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials. gov, UK Clinical Research Network, scrutiny of bibliographies of retrieved papers and contact with experts in the field. Inclusion criteria: relevant studies of any design of alcohol consumption and young adults with Type 1 diabetes (age 14 – 25 years) were included. The key outcomes were the quantity, pattern and impact of alcohol consumption, the effect on diabetes control {{and the effect of}} interventions <b>to</b> <b>minimize</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> of alcohol for this population. Results:? Six articles and two conference abstracts met the inclusion criteria. There were six cross-sectional studies, one qualitative study and one within-subjects design study. Quality of studies was variable. Alcohol use amongst young adults with Type 1 diabetes was reported to be common and potentially harmful. There was a paucity of evidence on interventions <b>to</b> <b>minimize</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> of alcohol in this target group. Conclusions:? Research is required to understand the social context of alcohol consumption in this population with a view to developing appropriate interventions <b>to</b> <b>minimize</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> associated with its use. <br/...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>minimizing</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> of soft errors at modelling {{level of}} mobile and ubiquitous systems is outlined. From a pure dependability viewpoint, critical components, whose failure {{is likely to}} impact on system functionality, attract more attention of protection/prevention mechanisms (against soft errors) than others do. Tolerating soft errors can be much improved if critical components can be identified at an early design phase and measures are taken to lower their criticalities at that stage. This improvement is achieved by presenting a criticality ranking (among the components) formed by combining a prediction of soft errors, consequences of them, and a propagation of failures at system modelling phase; and pointing out the ways to apply changes in <b>the</b> model <b>to</b> <b>minimize</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> of degradation of desired functionalities.
