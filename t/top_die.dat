This bending process can produce angles greater than 90° in a single hit on standard press brakes process.|$|E
5000|$|In the spring, fruiting {{structures}} (acervuli) {{form from}} corn residue and produce spores (conidia) that are dispersed by wind blown raindrops and splashing. Conidial spores infect young plants through the epidermis or stomata. Anthracnose develops rapidly in cloudy, overcast conditions with high temperatures and humidity. In optimal environmental conditions, conidia can germinate {{in as little}} as 6-8 hours in 100% humidity. [...] Initial necrotic spots or lesions can be seen within 72 hours after infection by conidia. Lower leaves that develop lesions provide conidial spores and cause secondary infections on the upper leaves and stalk. Vascular infections primarily occur from wounds caused by stalk-boring insects, such as the larvae of the European corn borer, allowing for conidia to infect and colonize the xylem. From this, anthracnose <b>top</b> <b>die</b> back (vascular wilt) or stalk rot can occur. In the fall, C. graminicola survives as a saprophyte on corn leaf residue. The pathogen can also overwinter on corn stalks as conidia in an extracellular secretion. The secretion prevents conidia from desiccating and protects them from unfavorable environmental conditions. Overwintering on corn residue serves as a vital source of primary inoculum for the leaf blight phase in the spring. The cycle will start all over again when susceptible corn seedlings emerge from the ground in the spring.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a deep drawing die (1) with a <b>top</b> <b>die</b> and a bottom die (2, 3), wherein the <b>top</b> <b>die</b> (2) has a holding down clamp (2 a) and the bottom die (3) has a die plate (3 a), and wherein at least one device (6), with which {{the distance between the}} holding down clamp (2 a) and the die plate (3 a) can be modified in portions or partially, is arranged in a flange region. The invention further relates to a method for deep drawing a workpiece (4) with a deep drawing die (1), wherein a workpiece (4) is inserted between a <b>top</b> <b>die</b> and a bottom die (2, 3) and deep drawn by closing the top and bottom dies (2, 3), and wherein at least one actuator (8) is controlled to generate a holding force during deep drawing. Essentially, the invention presented controls the flange feed of a workpiece (4) in the tool (1) by pressure distributions which are adjustable in the forming process. By selectively increasing forces in the flange feed at selected locations between holding down clamp (2 a) and die plate (3 a) it is possible to control the flow of material into the die plate (3 a) during deep drawing. Using this control, it is possible to relieve the load on regions with high deforming work, so that tears or cracks at these points in the finished component can be prevented. This involves increasing the friction between die plate (3 a) and plate (4) or between plate (4) and holding down clamp (2 a) by generating holding forces, as a result of which the material is held fast and prevented from flowing at this location...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Severe plastic {{deformation}} {{is defined as}} metal forming methods in which a very large strain is imposed to a bulk {{in order to make}} an ultra-fine grained metal.

In this investigation, a model of ECAP process has been developed based on FEM and effects of extrusion speed on effective strain, load and effective stress imposed in the copper road are researched.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand on {{the complexity of}} microelectronic components will soon require architectures that build in the third dimension. A number of current projects and world-wide {{research in this field}} focuses on technologies that aim at combining individual devices on wafer level into complex systems that have a variety of features. However, the interfaces available for interconnecting the individual components are limited and thus a three-dimensional approach will provide the ultimate solution. An architecture that enables the above mentioned features will largely challenge conventional inspection techniques for quality control and failure analysis. Of particular interest for 3 D-integrated devices are methods that operate non-or semi-destructively. Acoustic microscopy remains a powerful tool for investigating opaque samples and their internal structure. However, due to the continued miniaturization and the demand of higher resolution acoustic microscopy has to go to smaller wavelengths. In the current study bonded devices with electrical routings in the bonded interface were inspected using acoustic microscopy applying highly focussed ultrasonic transducers operating at 1 GHz. Inspected samples contained high density interconnects (10 (6) per cm(2)) forming large area arrays on 10 mu m and 15 mu m pitch. Acoustic inspection was performed through the <b>top</b> <b>die</b> of the device after thinning to 10 mu m thickness. The acoustic inspection was also performed through a polymer mechanical key after removal of the <b>top</b> <b>die.</b> Defects detected acoustically were confirmed by FIB-cross sectioning and high-resolution SEM imaging. Defects found were delaminations in the electrical cross-links and voids in the underfill material when inspecting samples with and without a thinned top-die. The trade-off between the achievable resolution, acoustic attenuation and the thickness of the top-die has {{to be taken into account}} when imaging through opaque materials. It is expected that semi-destructive preparation will be required in practical applications. However, for performing failure analysis the acoustic inspection and the detection of delaminations at the interfaces will be greatly beneficial for guiding additional destructive analyses...|$|E

The simulation {{results show that the}} curved distribution runner system is more suitable than the rectangular distribution one in the optical ferrule molding. Moreover, the effect of gravity on the ceramic injection molding process was discussed for determining a more reasonable balanced runner system of the special designed two-plate mold with six die cavities.
