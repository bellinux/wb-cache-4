5|$|In 2012, {{there are}} five extant schools of Noh acting called Kanze (観世), Hōshō (宝生), Komparu (金春), Kongō (金剛), and Kita (喜多) schools <b>that</b> <b>train</b> shite actors. Each school has its own iemoto family that carries {{the name of the}} school and is {{considered}} the most important. The iemoto holds the power to create new plays or modify lyrics and performance modes. Waki actors are trained in the schools Takayasu (高安), Fukuou (福王), and Hōshō (宝生). There are two schools <b>that</b> <b>train</b> kyōgen, Ōkura (大蔵) and Izumi (和泉). 11 schools train instrumentalists, each school specializing in one to three instruments.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1975, Ochs {{took on the}} {{identity}} of John Butler Train. He told people <b>that</b> <b>Train</b> had murdered Ochs, and that he, John Butler Train, had replaced him. Train was convinced that someone {{was trying to kill}} him, so he carried a weapon at all times: a hammer, a knife, or a lead pipe.|$|E
5|$|The Lake Shore Limited {{has served}} Lakefront Station from its opening in 1977. The Capitol Limited began {{stopping}} at Lakefront on November 12, 1990, after Conrail's abandonment of {{portions of the}} ex-Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway in northwestern Indiana forced the re-routing of <b>that</b> <b>train</b> along with the Broadway Limited. Previously it had passed to the south, serving Canton. Between 1998 and 2003, the Pennsylvanian served Cleveland, providing daylight service to Chicago and Philadelphia. Weak ridership prompted Amtrak to return the train to a Pittsburgh–New York schedule.|$|E

5|$|Another {{factor in}} making the Zephyr lighter than {{conventional}} trains was that the individual carbodies in the train share their trucks with adjacent cars. In this design by Budd engineer Walter B. Dean, the train was three articulated compartments. On conventional passenger cars, each carbody rode upon a pair of trucks (pivot-mounted wheel-axle assembly), with one truck at each end. The articulation not only {{reduced the number of}} trucks under the train, but it also dispensed with the need for couplers between each of the carbodies, further reducing the train's weight. It did, however, mean <b>that</b> <b>train</b> lengths could not be easily changed by switching out cars.|$|E
5|$|Mainer's first {{recordings}} came in 1934 and are compiled on Ragged But Right: 30's Country Bands. Mainer {{performed with}} The Mountaineers on tracks such as Maple on the Hill, Seven and a Half and Johnson's Old Grey Mule. Also {{included on the}} compilation are Mainer's later collaboration Short Life and It's Trouble with Zeke Morris, his solo effort Riding on <b>That</b> <b>Train</b> 45 and a sample song Mitchell Blues from his band the Sons of the Mountaineers. Throughout his career, he was noted for his unique and innovative two-finger banjo fingerpicking style, which some view as a precursor to three finger bluegrass banjo styles. Mainer took jobs at local radio stations to increase the visibility of his relative's ensemble, recording classics such as Take Me in the Lifeboat. During this time, he appeared on many regional stations including WBT in Charlotte, WPTF in Raleigh, WNOX in Knoxville and WPAQ in Mount Airy.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB found <b>that</b> <b>Train</b> 214 {{had come}} to a stop entirely within the faulty circuit B2-304, making it {{effectively}} invisible to the automatic train control system. Other trains had received speed commands of 0 when traveling through this circuit but had enough forward momentum {{to make it to the}} next circuit and resume detection and receipt of speed commands from the ATC system. Train 214 was going slower than normal because it was being driven in manual mode by its operator, and it came to a stop while remaining on circuit B2-304 and was therefore invisible. Train 112 behind it was given full speed commands by the ATC to proceed on the track. The investigation found that the emergency brakes had been applied by the operator of train 112 when train 214 came into view but it was too late to avert the collision.|$|E

25|$|After 2000 the German Football Association and the Bundesliga {{mandated}} that all clubs run a youth academy, {{with the aim}} of bolstering the stream of local talent for the club and national team. As of 2010 the Bundesliga and second Bundesliga spend €75m a year on these youth academies, <b>that</b> <b>train</b> five thousand players aged 12–18, increasing the under-23-year-olds in the Bundesliga from 6% in 2000 to 15% in 2010. This allows more money to be spent on the players that are bought, and there is a greater chance to buy better instead of average players.|$|E
25|$|On 14 October 2006, Railway Minister Lalu Prasad waved off {{the flag}} for a 1962 WP 7200 model steam {{locomotive}} Ruby Queen {{and the seven}} carriages as part of SCR's ruby jubilee celebrations. On its inaugural run to Falaknuma, the heritage train had only one stop — Kachiguda. The 'queen' was enthusiastically received by people who gathered at the station on that day.To run 120km, the awesome beauty consumes just 15,000kg of coal and 25,000 litres of water.

The last shipment of Jews (including those who had already died in transit) arrived in Bełżec in December 1942. The burning of exhumed corpses continued until March.

25|$|Three of {{the trains}} were {{captured}} by four men of Company K, 2nd New York Cavalry Regiment, who rode {{up to the}} train engineers and ordered them to surrender, which they did since only a few Confederate engineers of Colonel T. M. R. Talcott's command were the only soldiers near the station. In {{his account of the}} battle, Colonel Alanson Merwin Randol commanding the 2nd New York Cavalry said that the cars had been partially unloaded and were preparing to move away when Custer ordered Randol to capture the trains. The locomotive and one or two cars of one of the trains escaped toward Lynchburg before Custer's men could tear up the track in front of it to prevent its escape. The remaining car or cars of <b>that</b> <b>train</b> were burned. After Randol's men stopped the three other trains from getting away, they gathered both white and black prisoners, many from Confederate quartermaster and commissary details. Dismounted men from Pennington's brigade took control of the station and area.|$|E
