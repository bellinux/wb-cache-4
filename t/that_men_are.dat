5|$|Looking Forward is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Adapted from James Oliver Curwood's short story of the same name, the film follows a young chemist named Jack Goodwin. He discovers a chemical compound that puts a person {{into a state of}} sleep for a determined period of time and decides to test it upon himself. The first test is a success and Jack makes arrangements for his sleep of a hundred years, in a state similar to suspended animation. When he awakes in 2010 into a world ruled by women, he woos the female mayor. Jack joins a society to campaign for men's rights. The society ends up before the female mayor who jails all of them, save for Jack who she proposes to. Jack accepts on the condition <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> given back their rights and she accepts. The cast and production credits of the film are not known, but Theodore Marston was not the director. The film was released on December 20, 1910. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Stay-at-home dads {{make up a}} {{very small}} portion of the Australian {{population}} although this appears to be rapidly changing. In 2003, 91% of fathers with children aged under 15 years were employed with 85% employed full-time. Because of this, there are few role models or resources that can help Australian fathers with the stay-at-home dad role. The Australian Bureau of Statistics show that approximately 7% of two parents families with {{children under the age of}} 14 have a father who is unemployed and a mother who works full-time. Stay at home dads in Australia have almost doubled over the past decade from 57,900 to 106,000, and expected to increase in the future. Recent sociological studies have shown <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> dedicating more time and support to their children in comparison to the 19th century. The idea of a stay at home dad were far from mainstream, however the rising demand for female work has influenced this statistic to rise.|$|E
5|$|Villermé {{published}} Des prisons telles qu'elles sont et telles qu'elles devraient être (On Prisons as They Are and as They Should Be) in 1820. In {{this work}} he {{called attention to}} the unhealthy conditions of the prisons in Paris. He outlined several components of the prison systems that he believed should be abolished including torture, ill treatment, cells, and unequal treatment of prisoners based on the amount of money men are able to give up. Villermé urged the government of Paris to take after the newly reformed prison systems of the United States and Russia. His goal was to persuade officials to reevaluate the unhealthy living environments and treatments of men in prisons so <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> able to become functioning citizens upon their release. This work in particular reflects the multifaceted approach Villermé took in his research, combining knowledge of medicine, data analysis, and social epidemiology.|$|E

50|$|Early theorists {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> better eyewitnesses than women. This belief {{began with}} William Stern, who claimed <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> better at remembering details and {{less susceptible to}} misleading information than women. However, subsequent studies challenged Stern’s findings. Several contemporary findings show that overall; there are no significant gender differences in eyewitness memory.|$|R
25|$|Conservatives {{reject the}} {{assertion}} that different laws prescribed {{for men and women}} imply <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> more valuable than women.

25|$|Among other behaviors, {{this means}} <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely to}} favour {{chastity}} in a woman, as this way a male can be more certain that her offspring are his own. Such a strategy is seen in males, and maternity is never doubted by the female, and so a chaste male is not highly valued by a women. However, for men, female chastity confirms paternity, causing the male to compromising his sexual strategies in order to select a chaste mate.|$|E

25|$|Ovulating {{women are}} also {{seen as a}} threat. Research has shown that women subconsciously change their {{behaviour}} across their menstrual cycle, such as dressing more provocatively, which is noticed by men. In one study, men rated photos of ovulating (fertile) women as more attractive, compared to photos of women {{who were in the}} luteal (infertile) stage of the menstrual cycle. It is suggested <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> therefore more likely to pursue ovulating women, which become potential threats to their female mates.|$|E
25|$|The liberal {{champions of}} {{equality}} {{under the law}} were {{fully aware of the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> born unequal and that it is precisely their inequality that generates social cooperation and civilization. Equality under the law was in their opinion not designed to correct the inexorable facts of the universe and to make natural inequality disappear. It was, on the contrary, the device to secure for the whole of mankind the maximum of benefits it can derive from it. Henceforth no man-made institutions should prevent a man from attaining that station in which he can best serve his fellow citizens.|$|E
25|$|The skin of {{children}} becomes darker {{as they go}} through puberty and experience the effects of sex hormones. This darkening is especially noticeable in {{the skin of the}} nipples, the areola of the nipples, the labia majora in females, and the scrotum in males. In some people, the armpits become slightly darker during puberty. The interaction of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors on skin coloration with age is still not adequately understood, but it is known <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> at their darkest baseline skin color around the age of 30, without considering the effects of tanning. Around the same age, women experience darkening of some areas of their skin.|$|E

Most members were between 20 and 40 years old (73%) and were predominantly female (87%); coinciding with established social roles in the culture <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> alcoholics and women suffer from depression and other emotional problems. All members in the sample had average or below average levels of income. While members worked on average 2.5 hours per day and 87% {{were satisfied with the}} amount of time spent working per day (as it allowed them more time to participate in the group) 87% were also dissatisfied with their economic security.|$|E
25|$|Fundamentalist {{scholars}} {{justify the}} different religious laws {{for men and}} women by referring to the biological and sociological differences between men and women. For example, regarding the inheritance law which states that women’s share of inheritance is half that of men, Ayatollah Makarim Shirazi quotes the Imam Ali ibn Musa Al-reza who reasons {{that at the time of}} marriage man has to pay something to woman and woman receives something, and <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> responsible for both their wives' and their own expenses but women have no responsibility thereof. Women, however, make up 27% of the Iranian labor force, and the percentage of all Iranian women who are economically active has more than doubled from 6.1% in 1986 to 13.7% in 2000.|$|E
25|$|Perceptions of wage {{entitlement}} differ {{between women}} and men such <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> more likely to feel worthy of higher pay while women's sense of wage entitlement is depressed. Women's beliefs about their relatively lower worth and their depressed wage entitlement reflects their lower social status such that when women's status is raised, their wage entitlement raises as well. However, gender-related status manipulation has no impact on men's elevated wage entitlement. Even when men's status is lowered on a specific task (e.g., by telling them that women typically outperform men on this task), men do not reduce their self-pay and respond with elevated projections of their own competence. The usual pattern whereby men assign themselves more pay than women for comparable work might explain why men tend to initiate negotiations more than women.|$|E

50|$|Hollingworth also {{attacked}} the variability hypothesis theoretically, criticizing the underlying {{logic of the}} hypothesis. Hollingworth argued that the variability hypothesis was flawed because: (1) it had not <b>been</b> empirically established <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> more anatomically variable than women, (2) even if greater anatomical variability in <b>men</b> <b>were</b> established this would not necessarily mean <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> also more variable in mental traits, (3) even if it <b>were</b> established <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> more variable in mental traits this would not automatically mean <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> innately more variable, (4) variability is not significant in and of itself, but rather {{depends on what the}} variability consists of, and (5) that any possible differences in variability between men and women must also be understood with reference to the fact that women lack the opportunity to achieve eminence because of their prescribed societal and cultural roles. Additionally, the argument that great variability automatically meant greater range was criticized by Hollingworth.|$|R

25|$|Human capital {{explanations}} posit additionally <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely}} than women to preference their work life over their family life. However, the General Social Survey found that men were only slightly less likely than women to value short hours, and that preferences for particular job characteristics depended mostly on age, education, race, and other characteristics rather than on gender. In addition, other {{research has shown that}} men and women likely hold endogenous job preferences, meaning that their preferences are due to the jobs they hold and those they have held in the past rather than related inherently to gender. After taking into consideration men and women's jobs, there is no difference in their job preferences. Men and women engaged in similar types of work have similar levels of commitment to work and display other similar preferences.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{difference between}} de Romieu’s Brief Discourse and Estienne’s Paradoxes {{can be found}} within the author’s voice. Marie de Romieu’s is distinctly a woman’s voice, showcasing true indignity {{at the idea that}} it is women who lead men astray. She proceeds to thoroughly develop on the notion <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> at fault, attempting to seduce women with their wily ways. De Romieu then accuses them of blaming guileless women for the seduction they impose upon their innocence. She attributes the injustice to man’s ignorance, comparing him to a “cock who cannot distinguish between a pearl and a stone”. Furthermore, while Estienne’s audience was primarily masculine, de Romieu speaks to multiple audiences. She addresses women, including herself, as “us, women” and “we, my ladies”, as well as a universal and neutral “one”. She utilizes those when presenting dialogue in which a masculine voice presents arguments that are subsequently countered by her own female voice.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have found}} <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely to}} engage in extramarital sex if they are {{unsatisfied}} sexually, while women are {{more likely to engage}} in extramarital sex if they are unsatisfied emotionally. Kimmel and Van Der Veen found that sexual satisfaction may be more important to husbands and that wives are more concerned with compatibility with their partners. Studies suggest that individuals who can separate concepts of sex and love are more likely to accept situations where infidelity occurs. One study done by Roscoe, Cavanaugh, & Kennedy found that women indicated relationship dissatisfaction as the number one reason for infidelity, whereas men reported a lack of communication, understanding, and sexual incompatibility. Glass & Wright also found that men and women who are involved in both sexual and emotional infidelities reported being the most dissatisfied in their relationships than those who engaged in either sexual or emotional infidelity alone. In general, marital dissatisfaction overall is the number one reason often reported for infidelity for both sexes.|$|E
