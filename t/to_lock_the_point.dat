40|$|We {{describe}} {{and analyze the}} operation and stabilization of a Mach–Zehnder interferometer, which separates the carrier and the first-order sidebands of a phase-modulated laser field, and which is <b>locked</b> using <b>the</b> Hänsch–Couillaud method. In addition to the necessary attenuation, our interferometer introduces, via total internal reflection, a significant polarization-dependent phase delay. We employ a general treatment to describe an interferometer with an object that affects the field along one path, and we examine how this phase delay affects the error signal. We discuss the requirements necessary <b>to</b> ensure <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> <b>point</b> remains unchanged when phase modulation is introduced, and we demonstrate and characterize this locking experimentally.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. A fiber optic Fabry-Perot engine pressure sensor using a continuous wave laser source is implemented and tested. <b>The</b> operating <b>point</b> of <b>the</b> Fabrv-Perot sensor is <b>locked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> quadrature <b>point</b> by electronic feedback control of laser temperature. System design considerations are described. Two systems were built and tested with a gasoline engine and a diesel engine. Pressure signals from a fiber Fabrv-Perot sensor were found to be in good agreement with, those from a conventional piezoelectric sensor. Through the tests with engines, the feasibility as a useful pressure sensing device is assesed and described. Finally, an internal mirror tensile strength test is accomplished in an effort to build more reliable Fabry-Perot sensors and the results are presented...|$|R
