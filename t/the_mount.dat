5|$|The upper {{handling}} {{room was}} {{just below the}} visible part of <b>the</b> <b>mount.</b> It was armored and reinforced to support the weight of <b>the</b> <b>mount.</b> A person standing in the upper handling room could {{look up and see}} the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which <b>the</b> <b>mount</b> rotated. Hanging from <b>the</b> <b>mount,</b> and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to <b>the</b> <b>mount.</b> This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists.

30|$|The design {{strategies}} for powertrain mounting systems {{play an important}} role in the reduction of vehicular vibration and noise.

This paper presents a complete design process of <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> system, including <b>the</b> vibration decoupling, vibration simulation analysis, topology optimization, and experimental verification. Based on the 6 -degrees-of-freedom vibration coupling model of <b>the</b> powertrain <b>mounting</b> system, an optimization algorithm is used to extract the best design parameters of each <b>mount,</b> thus rendering <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> system fully decoupled and the natural frequency well configured, and the optimal parameters are used to design <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> system. Subsequently, vibration simulation analysis is applied to <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> system, considering both transmission and road excitations. According to the results of finite element analysis, the topological structure of the metal frame of <b>the</b> front <b>mount</b> is optimized to improve the strength and dynamic characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> system. Finally, <b>the</b> vibration bench test is used to verify the availability of the optimization design with the analysis of acceleration response and vibration transmissibility of <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> system. <b>The</b> results show that the vibration isolation performance of <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> system can be improved effectively using the vibration optimal decoupling method, and the structural modification of the metal frame can well promote the dynamic characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> system.|$|R

5|$|Although The Volcano is {{estimated}} to have last erupted 150years ago, {{it is one of}} the five volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province that have recorded seismicity since 1985.

Seismic data suggest that these volcanoes still contain active magma chambers, indicating that some Northern Cordilleran volcanoes are probably active, with significant potential hazards.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a complete design process of <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> system, including <b>the</b> vibration decoupling, vibration simulation analysis, topology optimization, and experimental verification. According {{to the actual}} state of <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> system, <b>the</b> 6 -DOF vibration model is established. The natural frequency and vibration mode are obtained using eigenvalue analysis. Considering the low-frequency vibration decoupling rate as the objective function, the design parameters (including mount hardness, thickness, and stiffness in all directions) that render <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> system fully decoupled and the natural frequency well configured are extracted, and the optimal parameters are used to design <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> system. Subsequently, <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> system is simulated and analyzed to study the vibration response. The torsional excitation of the shafting is calculated as the transmission excitation using the equivalent model, and the road excitation is simulated using the sinusoidal scanning signal based on the data of acceleration measured by the actual vehicle. A comprehensive analysis shows that the strength and dynamic characteristics of <b>the</b> front <b>mount</b> should be improved, and hence, topology optimization {{is applied to the}} metal frame. Finally, the vibration bench test of <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> system is carried out to extract the acceleration signals in time domain and frequency domain of the upper and lower parts of <b>the</b> <b>mounts.</b> <b>The</b> data is analyzed and the vibration transmissibility is calculated using the corresponding root-mean-square values of acceleration. The results showed that the design process of <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> system could well improve the vibration isolation performance.|$|R
