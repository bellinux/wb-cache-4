5|$|Dark Gaia then attacks Sonic and Chip, but Chip protects Sonic {{and calls}} {{all of the}} Gaia temples {{together}} to form the Gaia Colossus and fight Dark Gaia. The Gaia Colussus seemingly destroys Dark Gaia, but Dark Gaia is not finished with them or the Earth yet, and consumes the entire world in darkness, becoming Perfect Dark Gaia in the process. Chip then gives the restored Chaos Emeralds to Sonic, allowing him to turn into Super Sonic and destroy it; Dark Gaia then sinks back into the planet, but the battle takes its toll on Super Sonic. Chip saves Sonic by throwing him to the surface, before returning himself {{to the inside of}} the planet; he leaves behind his necklace and some parting words. Sonic places the necklace on his hand as a bracelet <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> their adventure together before speeding off with Tails, flying alongside him on the coastline in the Tornado plane.|$|E
5|$|As the Enterprise arrives, {{the crew}} members explore the offerings of Farpoint Station and {{establish}} relations with their Bandi host, Groppler Zorn (Michael Bell). The crew becomes suspicious when items they desire seem to appear out of nowhere moments later, and are unable to identify the power source that feeds the station. Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis), an empath, senses a being with powerful yet despairing emotions nearby, and the crew discover a strange labyrinth beneath the station, but Zorn does not offer an explanation. As the Enterprise crew continues its explorations, a large unknown alien craft enters orbit and begins to fire upon an older Bandi settlement near Farpoint Station, and abducts Zorn. Before Picard orders the ship's phasers to be fired at the craft, Q appears <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> humanity's trial and prompts Picard to send an away team to the alien craft. The away team discovers the craft has passages similar to those under Farpoint and {{they are able to}} free Zorn. Their actions cause the alien craft to transform into a jellyfish-like space creature, and Picard is able to deduce the mystery of Farpoint Station. He confirms with the apologetic Zorn that the Bandi found a similar lifeform injured on their planet and, while attempting to care for it, they also exploited its ability to synthesize matter to create Farpoint Station. The creature now in orbit is trying to help free its mate by attacking those who hold it captive.|$|E
5|$|Todd was {{initially}} a short-term villain, but his popularity {{with the audience}} and critics inspired the writers to forgo killing him or permanently sending him to prison, like most soap operas had done with rapists in the past. While keeping aspects of his personality dark or violent, they had Todd exhibit a conscience and compassion. They took steps to redeem him and made him {{an integral part of}} OLTL canvas, despite Howarth's objections to a redemption storyline. With the use of literary techniques for the redemptive arc, the writers borrowed from nineteenth-century melodrama and Gothic traditions, and literature such as Frankenstein. Todd became the product of an affair between his father, Victor Lord, and his mother, Irene Manning, which provided him a fortune and ties to other major characters, including his sisters, Tina and Victoria Lord. An important aspect of the character became his appearance, most notably the scar on his right cheek, which emerged as synonymous with him and served <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> his past misdeeds against Marty. Music and the use of humor were also key to Todd's development. Although he formed many relationships (including with his wives, Blair Cramer and Téa Delgado), and fathered children, a defining characteristic of his personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy.|$|E
5000|$|The Emperor {{continues}} to oversee his failing realm, where his subjects angrily protest their suspension in limbo {{between life and}} death. Harlequin appeals <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>reminding</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> his innocent childhood. The Drummer urges the Emperor to maintain his resolve, but the Emperor's memories turn his thoughts from {{his plans for the}} annihilation of all. Instead he gazes into a covered mirror and asks: [...] "What do men look like? Am I still a man or just the adding machine of God?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Chapter 2: The {{following}} morning, the Buddha {{tells his}} story to the gathered disciples. He begins the story by telling of his previous life, in which the future Buddha {{was living in the}} heavenly realms surrounded by divine pleasures. In this previous life, he was known as the Bodhisattva. The Bodhisattva is enjoying the immense pleasures of his heavenly life, but due to his past aspirations, one day the musical instruments of the heavenly palace call out <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>reminding</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> his prior commitment to attain awakening.|$|R
50|$|Filled with abhorrence for the {{strength}} and prominence of the White supremacy of his childhood town, the Colonel does all he can to undo the workings of Mr. William Fetters. The Colonel imagines building a library for the Black residence and fixing up White schools. However, Laura convinces <b>him</b> not <b>to,</b> <b>reminding</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> the violence that would come from the White residents because of their dedication to preventing Black people by any means possible from moving up in society, including restricting Blacks' ability to educate themselves. As Laura predicted, the plans of the Colonel to reconstruct Clarendon are met with strong opposition. People who {{were a part of}} the White supremacy and majority show the Colonel great defiance and hostility.|$|R
25|$|During the {{leadership}} election, Lamont clashed angrily in private with Nigel Lawson who preferred Michael Heseltine as Thatcher's successor, phoning Lawson up <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> his caustic remarks made about Heseltine's economic policies. Lamont eventually slammed {{the phone down}} on Lawson in temper, though he later wrote to Lawson to offer an apology.|$|E
25|$|San Francisco stormed back, driving 70 {{yards in}} seven plays on a drive that {{consumed}} only 2:24 {{and ended with}} Garcia's 26-yard touchdown pass to Owens. Owens added a 2-point conversion catch on the next play, cutting the 49ers deficit to 38–22. After the play, an iconic scene of defensive lineman Michael Strahan walking over to Owens and pointing to the scoreboard <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> the deficit they still faced would be a highlight of the game.|$|E
25|$|Hnæf and his unnamed nephew, said {{also to be}} Hildeburh's son, {{are placed}} on a funeral pyre. After this most of the Danish warriors leave, but Hengest and {{probably}} some of the Danes stay throughout winter. Eventually a figure {{referred to as the}} son of Hunlaf places a sword on Hengest's lap <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> his loyalties. Other Danes also return, and probably together they wreak havoc on the Frisians and slay king Finn. The Danes take the unnamed Frisian queen back to what appear to be her own people in Denmark, identifying the Frisian queen as probably Danish.|$|E
60|$|The {{first part}} of the Jew's caution would have availed little, for when Mariano was roused he recked little of his own life; but the {{reference}} <b>to</b> others <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> Angela and his father, so that he made up his mind to be a very model of forbearance whatever should happen.|$|R
50|$|O'Malley meets her {{daughter}} Melissa (Carol Lynley). He is immediately attracted <b>to</b> Missy, who <b>reminds</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> Belle {{when they were}} lovers years ago. Breckenridge, meanwhile, hires O'Malley to drive his herd to Texas.|$|R

25|$|Following Sun Quan's {{death in}} May 252, the Grand Tutor Zhuge Ke, {{who had been}} {{appointed}} regent for Sun Quan's youngest son and successor, Sun Liang, proposed to the imperial court to move the nobles away from areas with a heavy military presence. He thus relocated Sun Fen from Wuchang to Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi). However, Sun Fen turned furious {{when he heard about}} it and refused to move out of Wuchang. Zhuge Ke wrote a long letter to Sun Fen to warn him about the perils of not knowing his place and <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> the downfall of his fourth brother, Sun Ba, the Prince of Lu.|$|E
500|$|A Widener curator's {{compilation}} of [...] "fanciful oral history" [...] recited by student tour guides includes [...] "Flowers mysteriously appear every morning outside the Widener Room" [...] and [...] "Harry {{used to have}} carnations dyed crimson <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> Harvard, and so his mother kept up the tradition" [...] in the flowers displayed in the Memorial Rooms.|$|E
500|$|As {{the crowd}} departs, the stump starts cackling {{and makes the}} charlatan confess. The stump cackles again, {{demanding}} the king never hurt a wizard again, and build a statue of Babbitty on the stump <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> his foolishness. The king agrees and heads back to the palace. Afterwards, a [...] "stout old rabbit" [...] with a wand in its teeth hops out from a hole beneath the stump and leaves the kingdom.|$|E

2500|$|Lee {{returned}} {{to the role of}} Dracula in Hammer's [...] (1965). Lee's role has no lines, he merely hisses his way through the film. Stories vary as to the reason for this: Lee states he refused to speak the poor dialogue he was given, but screenwriter Jimmy Sangster claims that the script did not contain any lines for the character. This film set the standard for most of the Dracula sequels in the sense that half the film's running time was spent on telling the story of Dracula's resurrection and the character's appearances were brief. Lee went on record to state that he was virtually [...] "blackmailed" [...] by Hammer into starring in the subsequent films; unable or unwilling to pay him his going rate, they would resort <b>to</b> <b>reminding</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> how many people he would put out of work, if he did not take part.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nobody {{knows that}} better than he, Mrs. Rivers," [...] {{returned}} the doctor with an equally marked precision of manner, [...] "and you could not have a guest who {{would be less likely}} <b>to</b> make you <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> it." ...|$|R
500|$|Consumed by sport, Wills, to his father's chagrin, {{fell behind}} academically. It {{was said that}} he [...] "could {{not bring himself to}} study for {{professional}} work" [...] after [...] "having led a sort of nomadic life when a youth in Australia". Suffering from homesickness, he decorated his study with objects <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> Lexington, including Aboriginal weapons. Horatio wrote to Tom about the latter's friends, the Djab wurrung: [...] "They told me to send you up to them as soon as you came back." ...|$|E
500|$|Since 1963, the Doctor has {{travelled}} {{with various}} companions who generally serve <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> his [...] "moral duty". The casting of Billie Piper as the Ninth Doctor's primary female companion Rose Tyler {{was announced in}} May 2004. Julie Gardner felt that the young actress and former pop star was perfect as a [...] "unique" [...] and [...] "dynamic" [...] companion for the Doctor. Press for the series focused heavily {{on the fact that}} Rose was to be more independent and courageous than previous companions. Prior to the casting of Piper, Eccleston had joked that [...] "I'll be doing the running around screaming." [...] He later opined that Rose is not as [...] "vulnerable" [...] as previous companions and that [...] "she's as brave and courageous and intelligent as he is" [...] citing the fact that she saves the Doctor's life. Piper remarked that the Doctor challenges Rose more than anyone else in her life and that he in turn sees in her [...] "she has huge potential, to be someone really, really great." [...] Eccleston felt that Rose is a [...] "heroine" [...] who [...] "teaches [...] huge emotional lessons". He felt that {{the relationship between the two}} characters was [...] "love at first sight" [...] although in a more mysterious fashion than a conventional love affair. Commentators on the series noted the romantic tension between the two characters. In their book Who is the Doctor?, Graeme Burk and Robert Smith described the climactic kiss between the Ninth Doctor and Rose in [...] "The Parting of the Ways" [...] as being something [...] "we all secretly wanted, even though it ultimately killed him".|$|E
500|$|During {{their second}} meeting, Cisneros asked Martínez {{to cast a}} spell on Fischer. Martínez said {{she was unable to}} do that, and Cisneros grew angry and left the store. A few days later, Cisneros called Martínez and asked her to pray for Fischer to get back {{together}} with Cristina. Cisneros returned for a third visit to Martínez's shop in October 1992, and asked her if she knew anyone willing to beat up Fischer. By winter, she changed her request and asked to have Fischer killed, offering US$3,000 to the person who would do it. According to Martínez, Cisneros told her that Fischer had raped Cristina and was telling his classmates at St. Joe that he had sex with her. However, Cristina said she never had sex with him. Although Garza assured Martínez that he would find someone to carry out the job, he kept calling and visiting her to discuss his marriage problems. Under pressure from Cisneros, Martínez would often interrupt the sessions with Garza <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> the plan. Garza lied to Martínez on several occasions telling her he had someone lined up to kill Fischer. Cisneros contacted Martínez in November to ask her why the job had not been done. Martínez responded that she did not know when the murder would be carried out. Garza eventually divorced his wife on January 4, 1993, and kept calling Martínez to tell her his personal problems had not been fixed. On January 9, he traveled to Brownsville from San Antonio to talk about the divorce, and Martínez reminded him that a client of hers wanted Fischer dead. She told him again that if he facilitated Fischer's murder, Garza's personal problems would be solved.|$|E
60|$|Strange, {{but even}} the few hours' absence which had intervened; during which, Harry had been left to himself, to stare at strange streets, and strange faces, had wrought a marked change in his countenance. He was a {{creature}} of the suddenest impulses. Left to himself, the strange streets seemed now <b>to</b> have <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> his friendless condition; and I found him with a very sad eye; and his right hand groping in his pocket.|$|R
50|$|In {{his flat}} Chris hears strange voices coming from next door - a couple arguing. He keeps seeing a woman around town, from time <b>to</b> time, who <b>reminds</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> {{the woman in}} the photo. And he discovers a bloody knife in his shower.|$|R
50|$|Elgar is {{not known}} to have done any work on the concerto until 1919. However, {{as far back as}} 1900 the cellist of the Brodsky Quartet, Carl Fuchs, had {{extracted}} from Elgar an agreement to write a cello concerto. Fuchs later wrote <b>to</b> Elgar <b>reminding</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> this agreement. In 1903, Fuchs' friend the cellist Paul Grümmer reiterated the request orally, and in 1906 by letter. So the idea of such a piece was not new.|$|R
2500|$|In Doctor Who, revival series 6, episode 11 [...] "The God Complex" [...] (Air date: September 17, 2011), the {{character}} called Joe [...] "quotes the finale of old English nursery rhyme 'Oranges and Lemons,' singing 'Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop off your head!,' which echoes {{a moment in}} George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, where Winston Smith uses a snatch of the same rhyme <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> a forgotten and innocent past." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Canio enters, {{he hears}} Nedda and exclaims [...] "Name of God! Those same words!" [...] He tries to {{continue}} the play, but loses control and demands to know her lover's name. Nedda, hoping to keep to the performance, calls Canio by his stage name [...] "Pagliaccio," [...] <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> the audience's presence. He answers with his arietta: [...] He sings that if his face is pale, it is not from the stage makeup but from the shame she has brought him. The crowd, impressed by his emotional performance, which they do not realize is real, cheers him.|$|E
2500|$|Guns N' Roses {{signed with}} a major record label within eight months of the band's inception, and topped {{national}} sales charts weeks after garnering late hours airplay on MTV. Appetite for Destruction is the highest-selling debut album of all time in the United States. Peers of the band {{in the music industry}} often spoke highly of the band. Joe Perry stated that the band was the first group <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> Led Zeppelin. Ozzy Osbourne stated that Guns N' Roses could have been [...] "the next Rolling Stones" [...] if the classic lineup stayed together. Country musician Steve Earle stated in 1989 that [...] "Guns n' Roses are what every L.A. band pretends to be".|$|E

[...] The Deal magazine reported, [...] "Espuelas couldn't have picked a more challenging era in which to launch a media company. The Internet has transformed everything from distribution to consumer behavior. Ironically, Espuelas erred in underestimating the one medium he should have understood best, the Internet.

2500|$|In a May 2014 {{interview}} with the Australian Financial Reviews Christopher Joye, Donaldson disclosed {{that he had been}} shot in the leg during a contact in Afghanistan: [...] "This 35-year-old 'shooter' has also been clipped through his left hamstring, where a slug remains <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> why he should never have traversed a track while a Taliban carrying night-vision goggles zeroed in with an AK-47." [...] He also spoke about killing terrorists: [...] "Pressed on the burden of taking another life, he says that rubbing out bad guys in [...] "gun fights" [...] – a notably [...] "more personal experience than dropping bombs from jets" [...] – is just a [...] "part of the job". Donaldson is at peace with a profession that few have the mental or physical equipment to pursue: [...] "I don’t get nightmares, mate. Sure you remember stuff; I just don’t dwell on it." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Russell Hulme {{provides}} {{further evidence}} that the music of The Zoo, or {{at least part of}} it, was already in existence before Trial by Jury opened. [...] He notes that Sullivan's sketch manuscript for Trial contains the first sixteen bars of a solo for the Usher that was deleted before the opera's premiere, called [...] "His Lordship's always quits". [...] Aside from a key change, it is the same tune that Sullivan would use for Carboy's aria in The Zoo, [...] "I loved her fondly." [...] But because Sullivan entered only a bit of the tune in his sketch, Hulme concluded that the composer [...] "needed only a few notes <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> his intentions. (Nowhere else in the sketches do we find similar curtailment.) [...] It is reasonable to suggest {{that he was able to}} do this because he intended drawing on ready-made material." ...|$|E
60|$|A solemn {{and respectful}} silence succeeded this {{incoherent}} {{burst from the}} lips of the Delaware prophet.
