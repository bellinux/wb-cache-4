5|$|A {{cancerous}} patient, Marina Wagner (Amanda Collins), {{is admitted}} {{into the hospital}} and is revealed to have toxic blood - presumably caused by a chemical reaction between an herbal supplement and chemotherapy - making several physicians fall ill. O'Malley is exposed to the neurotoxin, and quickly becomes anxious, fearing that his marriage is the cause of the sickness. Ellis is diagnosed with a heart condition, in which surgery or medication are options. Ellis does not want the surgery, but Meredith fears that she will not be compliant with her medication. Shepherd and Burke try to close up Wagner as <b>the</b> <b>OR</b> was evacuated before her surgery was completed, by entering the operating room with sealed, airtight suits. Ellis agrees to the surgery, but opts to speak with Webber, her former lover. A teenage patient is brought into the clinic by her father, hoping that a doctor can teach her how to use tampons. When her father leaves the room, she explains to Bailey that she had sex, but her pregnancy test is negative. Shepherd and Burke run out of air whilst operating on Wagner, so Yang, Stevens, and Meredith enter holding their breath to close the patient's incision. O'Malley's colleagues act in a rude manner to his new marriage, and displeased, he lectures them, standing up for Torres. Sloan is seen to be having sex with Montgomery, and Yang agrees to marry Burke. At the conclusion of the episode, Ellis' lucidity has vanished, leaving Meredith and Webber distraught.|$|E
5|$|By midday on August 15, rainbands with gusty winds began {{affecting}} the Texas coastline. As it moved ashore, the storm produced heavy rainfall near and to <b>the</b> <b>or</b> northeast of its path, reaching 11.02inches (280mm) at a station in Lockwood. The storm caused several bayous in the Houston area to reach or exceed flood levels. Across southeastern Texas, the cyclone spawned several funnel clouds, and near IAH an EF0 tornado was reported. Wind gusts from Erin were minor across the state, peaking at 35mph (55km/h) at Palacios with an unofficial report of 39mph (63km/h) at Jamaica Beach. Upon moving ashore, the storm produced a minor storm surge peaking at 3.22feet (0.98m) at Pleasure Pier, which caused minor beach erosion.|$|E

5|$|Cristina is re-hired and Owen {{asks for}} a divorce once Cristina wants to reconcile. Shocked, Cristina agrees, but later finds out that the {{potential}} conflict of interest regarding the plane crash lawsuit was a key motive behind Owen's request and confronts him. Owen tells her that he 'feels responsible' and was worried as {{he thought she was}} dead. They have a sexual relationship after divorcing. The hospital is sued and found guilty of negligence. The surviving doctors, including Yang, must receive $15 million of compensation each, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurers refuse to pay. Yang, Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), and the other surviving doctors buy the hospital {{with the help of the}} Harper-Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. After buying the hospital, Yang realizes that she was made for <b>the</b> <b>O.R.</b> and breaks things off with Owen because he still wants kids and she still doesn't.|$|E

While saying her farewell to her colleagues of the last seven years, there is a possible act of terrorism in Seattle, which later turns out to be just a gas main explosion. Cristina has a quick but emotional goodbye hug with Derek, Bailey, and Webber, leaves her shares of the hospital to Alex, and dances it out with Meredith one last time to an old favorite song. Owen, however, is busy saving a patient in <b>the</b> <b>O.R.,</b> so they share a silent goodbye through the gallery's glass.|$|E
5|$|Meredith recovers {{enough to}} start seeing Nathan Riggs, Owen Hunt's former best friend, by season 13, {{although}} their relationship {{is complicated by the}} fact that Maggie confesses to Meredith that she has feelings for Riggs and Meredith is not ready to declare their relationship formally or publicly. Eventually she accepts her relationship with Riggs, but it's complicated by the unexpected return of Owen's sister, Megan Hunt, Riggs' fiancée. Meredith finds herself in another love triangle when Megan rejects Riggs because he is still in love with Meredith, but Meredith pushes them to be together. After her relationship with Riggs ends, Meredith is nominated for a Harper Avery Award for her groundbreaking surgery on Megan. In the penultimate 300th episode, after failing to attend the award ceremony to stay for a medical trauma, post surgery Meredith learns with all her closest friends in <b>the</b> <b>OR</b> room thag she has won the Harper Avery Award.|$|E
