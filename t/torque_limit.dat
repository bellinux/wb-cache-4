5000|$|A {{torque tester}} [...] is {{required}} during the packaging design process. It {{could be used}} as a destructive tester to identify if there is any material weakness of the packaging during the screwing process. It also allows to define the torque tolerances of the capping machine. The lower <b>torque</b> <b>limit</b> is considered as the minimum pressure of the cap to avoid any leak of the product. This torque test needs to be combined with a leak test with secure seal analyzer. The higher <b>torque</b> <b>limit</b> is the maximum torque the customer can apply to open or close the product's cap.|$|E

50|$|A {{coupling}} is {{a device}} used to connect two shafts together at their ends {{for the purpose}} of transmitting power. Couplings do not normally allow disconnection of shafts during operation, however there are torque limiting couplings which can slip or disconnect when some <b>torque</b> <b>limit</b> is exceeded.|$|E
50|$|A {{ball detent}} type limiter transmits force through {{hardened}} balls which rest in detents {{on the shaft}} and are held in place with springs. An over-torque condition pushes the balls out of their detents, thereby decoupling the shaft. It can have single or multiple detent positions, or a snap acting spring which requires a manual reset. There may be a compression adjustment to adjust the <b>torque</b> <b>limit.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} many {{references}} to the numbering designation that Opel elected to utilise for gearboxes; {{one of the more}} common arguments is that it refers to the ft·lbf torque capacity of the gearbox, in this case being a 250 lbft Nm <b>torque</b> <b>limit.</b> Other arguments include that it is simply related to the engine size (the F25 gearbox was often fitted to 2.5-litre engine vehicles).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the implementation of}} Digital PI Controller Using Anti Wind-Up Mechanism For A Speed Controlled Electric Drive System. To eliminate the system zeros relocated proportional integral controller is implemented. Which in turn reduces the over shoots. The <b>torque</b> is not <b>limited,</b> inspite {{of the use of}} relocated proportional integral controller. The motor windings get damaged, if the torque reaches higher values. In order to <b>limit</b> this <b>torque,</b> we introduce a <b>torque</b> limiter, which <b>limits</b> the <b>torque</b> value to the permissible limits. Due to <b>limited</b> <b>torque,</b> over shoots are produced for large inputs. To eliminate these overshoots, with <b>limited</b> <b>torque,</b> we implement the anti-windup mechanism.

50|$|A {{synchronous}} {{magnetic torque}} limiter uses permanent magnets mounted to each shaft, {{with an air}} gap between. They are very fast acting, but may have more backlash than mechanical types. Because there is no mechanical contact between the two shafts, they are also used to transmit torque through a physical barrier like a thin plastic wall. On some models, the <b>torque</b> <b>limit</b> may be adjusted by changing {{the gap between the}} magnets.|$|E

50|$|After {{receiving}} an operation command, the actuator moves the valve in direction OPEN or CLOSE. When reaching the end position, an automatic switch-off procedure is started. Two fundamentally different switch-off mechanisms can be used. The controls switch off the actuator {{as soon as}} the set tripping point has been reached. This is called limit seating. However, there are valve types for which the closing element has to be moved in the end position at a defined force or a defined torque to ensure that the valve seals tightly. This is called torque seating. The controls are programmed as to ensure that the actuator is switched off when exceeding the set <b>torque</b> <b>limit.</b> The end position is signalled by a limit switch.|$|E
50|$|Originally, the {{connector}} {{was designed}} to carry signals at frequencies up to 1 GHz in military applications, but today's common Type N easily handles frequencies up to 11 GHz. More recent precision enhancements to the design by Julius Botka at Hewlett Packard have pushed this to 18 GHz. The male connector is hand-tightened (though versions with a hex nut are also available) and has an air gap between the center and outer conductors. The coupling has a 5/8-24 thread. The center coaxial contacts are identical to TNC and BNC connectors. Amphenol suggests tightening to a torque of 15 inlb Nm, while Andrew Corporation suggest 20 inlb Nm for their hex nut variant. As <b>torque</b> <b>limit</b> depends only on thread quality and cleanliness, whereas the main operational requirement is good RF contact without significant steps or gaps, these values {{should be seen as}} indicative rather than critical.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a mechanism for}} permitting convenient manual or servo-powered control of a boom assembly, which is rotatably positionable about yaw and pitch axes by means of releasably locking, yaw and pitch torque-limiting mechanisms, each {{of which may be}} locked, unlocked, and positioned by respective yaw and pitch levers. The boom may be longitudinally projected and withdrawn by rotating a boom extension/retraction crank. <b>Torque</b> <b>limiting</b> is provided by spring loaded clutch mechanisms, whereby positioning forces applied to the handles are effective to move the boom unless overcome by greater opposing forces, sufficient to overcome the torque applied by the <b>torque</b> <b>limiting</b> clutch mechanisms.

40|$|Motivated by {{the need}} for formal {{guarantees}} on the stability and safety of controllers for challenging robot control tasks, we present a control design procedure that explicitly seeks to maximize {{the size of an}} invariant "funnel" that leads to a predefined goal set. Our certificates of invariance are given in terms of sums of squares proofs of a set of appropriately defined Lyapunov inequalities. These certificates, together with our proposed polynomial controllers, can be efficiently obtained via semidefinite optimization. Our approach can handle time-varying dynamics resulting from tracking a given trajectory, input saturations (e. g. <b>torque</b> <b>limits),</b> and can be extended to deal with uncertainty in the dynamics and state. The resulting controllers can be used by space-filling feedback motion planning algorithms to fill up the space with significantly fewer trajectories.

40|$|When a {{robot system}} collides with its environment, {{unexpected}} position errors occur {{due to the}} effect of impact. Large actuation effort may grow up to compensate for these errors. The sudden increases of actuator torque may violate the <b>torque</b> <b>limit.</b> In this papec we propose to employ redundant actuation mode to facilitate disturbance rejection. An optimal loud distribution algorithm for redundantly actuated system is introduced to reduce the effect of shocks. This scheme distributes the compensating effort to the system actuators in consideration of the <b>torque</b> <b>limit.</b> The disturbance rejection capability of the proposed scheme is compared with those of other load distribution methods by simulation and experiment.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from EWTEC via the link in this record. This paper investigates the design trade-off between power production and structural loading for Wave Energy Converters (WECs), based on tank test results for the Albatern 12 S floating wave energy array. This work feeds into the design development process, which is currently in the concept design and testing phase. The paper focuses on two methods for reducing structural loading: limiting the power take off (PTO) torque generation capacity (for operational loads), and controlling the PTO damping (for extreme loads). The torque that can be generated by the primary PTO mechanism affects the size (and cost) of the structural components within the device. Increased torque results in a potentially greater power capture, but also greater structural loading. It is therefore important to highlight the target <b>torque</b> <b>limit</b> early in the design process. The aim of this work is to identify the optimum <b>torque</b> <b>limit</b> to refine the design towards the lowest overall Levelised Cost of Energy (LCoE). In addition, a high-level investigation {{of the impact of}} PTO damping on extreme loading has been carried out, to help to identify appropriate “operational” and “survival” sea states for the device. The paper calculates an optimum <b>torque</b> <b>limit</b> for the device at the West Harris site and quantifies the trade-off between Annual Energy Production and structural cost, using the LCoE as an optimisation criteria. The approach is in principle applicable to other technologies, if the design drivers are adjusted to the technology’s working principle.

40|$|The {{two major}} classes of {{laminate}} joints are bonded and bolted. Often the two classes are combined as bonded-bolted joints. Several characteristics of {{fiber reinforced composite}} materials render them more susceptible to joint problems than conventional metals. These characteristics include weakness in in-plane shear, transverse tension/compression, interlaminar shear, and bearing strength relative to the strength and stiffness in the fiber direction. Studies on bolted joints of composite materials have been focused on joining assembly subject to in-plane loads. Modes of failure under these loading conditions are net-tension failure, cleavage tension failure, shear-out failure, bearing failure, etc. Although the studies of torque load {{can be found in}} literature, they mainly discussed the effect of the torque load on in-plane strength. Existing methods for calculating <b>torque</b> <b>limit</b> for a mechanical fastener do not consider connecting members. The concern that a composite member could be crushed by a preload inspired the initiation of this study. The purpose is to develop a fundamental knowledge base on how to determine a <b>torque</b> <b>limit</b> when a composite member is taken into account.
