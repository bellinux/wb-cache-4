5|$|In 2013, Bevin {{announced}} he would challenge Kentucky's senior U.S. Senator, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, in the 2014 Republican primary. Although he gained the support of various groups aligned with <b>the</b> <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> <b>Movement,</b> McConnell attacked him repeatedly for inconsistencies in his public statements and policy positions and defeated him by almost 25 percentage points. After announcing he would seek the governorship in 2015, Bevin emerged from a four-way Republican primary, besting his nearest competitor, Agriculture Commissioner James Comer by 83 votes.

5|$|With {{incumbent}} U.S. Representative Bill Delahunt {{choosing to}} retire, Keating declared his candidacy in the 2010 congressional election. In order {{to run for}} Delahunt's 10th district seat, Keating moved from his longtime home in Sharon (located in the neighboring 4th district) to a rental property in Quincy. On September 14, he won the Democratic primary against state senator Robert O'Leary. Keating faced Republican state Representative Jeff Perry in the general election. In the wake of <b>the</b> <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> <b>movement</b> and the election of Republican U.S. Senator Scott Brown, the campaign was unusually close for a modern Massachusetts race, which would normally skew heavily Democratic. The Keating campaign largely focused on a 1991 incident during Perry's tenure as a police sergeant, in which a teenage girl had been illegally strip-searched by another officer while Perry was on the scene. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran a widely aired advertisement highlighting the incident and challenging Perry's character. With 47 percent of the vote, Keating defeated Perry (42 percent) and two independents in the November 2 election.|$|E

The present draft of the document was published on May 13, 2009 and incorporated much of the feedback that Barnett had received in response to the previous draft. The document is an expansion of an earlier 'Federalist Amendment' that Barnett composed as part of an article he wrote in the Wall Street Journal.|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} an {{examination}} of <b>the</b> <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> <b>movement's</b> effects on <b>the</b> 2010 midterm elections. <b>The</b> <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> proves to be a grassroots movement that was initially spurred by economic crisis and gradually pulled within the Republican Party. While a handful of experienced conservative interest groups—and the Republican Party itself—managed to use <b>the</b> energies of <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> sentiment to effect a Republican takeover of the House of Representatives, the movement's decentralized and independent nature prevented grassroots <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> groups from being a significant force in <b>the</b> election. While <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> supporters continue to resist organization, the effective translation of their political concerns into policy change seems very unlikely. Moreover, {{in the absence of}} severe economic crisis, their fortunes seem certain to be determined by the Republican Party...|$|R
