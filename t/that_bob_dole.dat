50|$|With one angry caller, Hamburger claimed <b>that</b> <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> had censored the show, {{to which}} the caller replied 'Yeah, fuck Bob Dole!'. Hamburger then {{suggested}} the caller 'go down to the local wall' and spray paint 'Fuck Bob Dole' on it, {{to which the}} caller replied 'I'll spray paint everything'. This has become a joke with fans of Poolside Chats, who bring up their dislike for Dole because of his censorship.|$|E

He is a graduate of Bishop McGuinness Catholic High School in Oklahoma City and Washington and Lee University in Virginia, where he received a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. At W&L, he was a co-chairman of the 1996 Mock Convention, which correctly predicted <b>that</b> <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> would receive the Republican presidential nomination. After attending W&L, he received his J.D. from the University of Oklahoma.|$|E
5000|$|With {{respect to}} the issues, Dole promised a 15% {{across-the-board}} reduction in income tax rates and made former Congressman and supply side advocate Jack Kemp his running mate. Bill Clinton framed the narrative against Dole early, painting him as a mere clone of unpopular House Speaker Newt Gingrich, warning America <b>that</b> <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> would work {{in concert with the}} Republican Congress to slash popular social programs, like Medicare and Social Security, dubbed by Clinton as [...] "Dole-Gingrich". Bob Dole's tax-cut plan found itself under attack from the White House, who said it would [...] "blow a hole in the deficit," [...] which had been cut nearly in half during his opponent's term.|$|E
5000|$|Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, {{joined by}} Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., and Justice William Rehnquist concurred in the {{judgment}} only. Justice O’Connor, a former Arizona statehouse legislator, began by noting <b>that</b> Senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole,</b> “the architect of the compromise”, had insisted the 1982 amendment explicitly disclaim any right to racially proportional representation. [...] Nevertheless, Justice O’Connor sees the majority opinion as attempting to create a right to “usual, roughly proportional representation”. Justice O’Connor next agrees with Justice White that the plurality was wrong to insist the only relevant evidence is {{the race of the}} voters. She writes that the law does not permit “an arbitrary rule against consideration of all evidence considering voting preferences”.|$|R

Obama was to repeat his win in 2012 by 1.49 percent, but a dramatic swing to Republican Donald Trump in 2016 saw him win by the largest margin since Ronald Reagan’s 1984 landslide.|$|R
