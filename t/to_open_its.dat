5|$|The snout {{shape of}} {{crocodilians}} varies between species. Crocodiles may have either broad or slender snouts, while {{alligators and caimans}} have mostly broad ones. Gharials have snouts that are extremely elongated. The muscles that close the jaws are much more massive and powerful than the ones that open them, and a crocodilian's jaws can be held shut by a person fairly easily. Conversely, the jaws are extremely difficult to pry open. The powerful closing muscles attach at the median of portion of the lower jaw and the jaw hinge attaches to the atlanto-occipital joint, allowing the animal <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>its</b> mouth fairly wide.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Hungry Jack's renewed its {{franchise}} agreement with then BK parent Burger King Corporation, which allowed Hungry Jack's to license third party franchisee. One {{of the terms}} and conditions of the renewed agreement required Hungry Jack's to open a minimum number of new locations each year {{for the duration of}} the contract. Shortly after the Australian trademark on the Burger King name lapsed in 1996, Burger King requested that Cowin rebrand the Hungry Jack's locations to Burger King, which Cowin declined. Burger King Corporation accused Hungry Jack's of violating the conditions of the renewed {{franchise agreement}} by failing to expand the chain at the rate defined and sought to terminate the agreement. Under the aegis of this claim, Burger King Corporation, in partnership with Royal Dutch Shell's Australian division Shell Company of Australia Ltd., began <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>its</b> own stores in 1997 beginning in Sydney and extending throughout the regions of New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. In addition, BK sought to limit HJ's ability to open new locations in the country, whether they were corporate locations or third-party licensees.|$|E
5|$|On April 22, 1844, Secretary Calhoun {{signed the}} treaty of {{annexation}} and ten days later delivered it to the Senate for consideration in secret session. The details of the treaty negotiations and supporting documents were leaked by Senator Benjamin Tappan of Ohio to the press. Tappan, a Democrat, was an opponent of annexation and of slavery. The terms of the Tyler-Texas treaty {{and the release of}} Calhoun's letter to British ambassador Richard Pakenham exposed the annexation campaign as a program to expand and preserve slavery. In the Pakenham letter, Calhoun alleged that the institution of slavery contributed to the physical and mental well-being of Southern slaves. The U.S. Senate was compelled <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>its</b> debates on ratification to public scrutiny, and hopes for its passage by the two-thirds majority required by the Constitution were abandoned by administration supporters. In linking Texas annexation to the expansion of slavery, Calhoun had alienated many who might previously have supported the treaty.|$|E
