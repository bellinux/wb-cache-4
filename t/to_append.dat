5|$|Deir Ghassaneh and Beit Rima were merged {{and granted}} {{municipal}} status in February 1966 during Jordanian rule, partially {{due to the}} efforts of Kassim al-Rimawi, the rural affairs minister at the time and a native of Beit Rima. Its first mayor, Adib Mohammed Rimawi, was appointed by King Hussein. The municipality building is located in Beit Rima. In June 1967 Israel occupied the West Bank after defeating Arab forces in the Six Day War. In 1972 the first municipal polls were held and Fa'eq Ali Rimawi was elected. In 1978 Bani Zeid was one of several Palestinian localities <b>to</b> <b>append</b> its municipal seal to the Memorandum from the masses and the institutions of the West Bank to the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization in a display of unity with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The memorandum was a rejection of any solution, regardless of its origin, not containing a clear recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to establishing an independent Palestinian national state. In 2000 Bani Zeid was incorporated into Area A giving the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), the Palestinian governing body established after the Oslo Agreements with Israel in 1993, full control over security and civilian affairs in the town.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{when the}} family name reform was {{introduced}} in the mid-19th century, the default was to use a patronym, or a matronym when the father was dead or unknown. The typical derivation was <b>to</b> <b>append</b> the suffix -escu to the father's name, e.g. Anghelescu ("Anghel's child") and Petrescu ("Petre's child"). (The -escu seems to come from Latin -iscum, thus being cognate with Italian -esco and French -esque.) The other common derivation was <b>to</b> <b>append</b> the suffix -eanu to the name of the place of origin, especially when one came from a different region, e.g. Munteanu ("from the mountains") and Moldoveanu ("from Moldova"). These uniquely Romanian suffixes strongly identify ancestral nationality.|$|E

25|$|In Figure 5, both ribosomal {{subunits}} (small and large) assemble at {{the start}} codon (towards the 5' end of the RNA). The ribosome uses RNA that matches the current codon (triplet) on the mRNA <b>to</b> <b>append</b> an amino acid to the polypeptide chain. This is done for each triplet on the RNA, while the ribosome moves towards the 3' end of the mRNA. Usually in bacterial cells, several ribosomes are working parallel on a single RNA, forming {{what is called a}} polyribosome or polysome.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{breakthroughs}} in molecular, cell, evolutionary, and developmental biology generated {{a cornucopia of}} data-based theory relevant to cognition. Categorical assignments were problematic. For example, the decision <b>to</b> <b>append</b> cognitive to a body of biological research on neurons, e.g. the cognitive biology of neuroscience, is separate from the decision to put such body of research in a category named cognitive sciences. No less difficult a decision needs be made—between the computational and constructivist approach to cognition, and the concomitant issue of simulated v. embodied cognitive models—before appending biology to a body of cognitive research, e.g. the cognitive science of artificial life.|$|E
5000|$|Biblical Hebrew often {{expresses a}} pronoun direct object by appending a pronominal suffix {{directly}} to the verb, as an alternative <b>to</b> <b>appending</b> it <b>to</b> the preposition that signals a definite direct object.

40|$|Given {{a linear}} time-invariant control system, {{it is well}} known that the {{transmission}} zeroes are the generalized eigenvalues of a matrix pencil. Adding outputs to place additional zeroes is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>appending</b> rows <b>to</b> this pencil to place new generalized eigenvalues. Adding inputs is likewise equivalent <b>to</b> <b>appending</b> columns. Since both problems are dual to each other, in this paper we only show how to choose the new rows to place the new zeroes in any desired locations. The process involves the extraction of the individual right Kronecker blocks of the pencil, accomplished entirely with unitary transformations. In particular, when adding one new output, i. e., appending a single row, the maximum number of new zeroes that can be placed is exactly the largest right Kronecker index...|$|R

500|$|The Student, before Smart's work, was {{a serious}} {{magazine}} that included a few poems and critical essays. However, once he joined and began writing under many pseudonyms, the magazine became filled with satire, parody, and humorous essays and poems. Along with him composing 15 of the essays {{and the majority of}} the poems published in the two volumes of the magazine, he decided <b>to</b> <b>append</b> three of The Inspector, a [...] "humorous news report", to the second of the volumes. These reports included many [...] "puff pieces" [...] promoting Smart's works along with various stories written by his friends and associates, including the famous writers/poets Henry Fielding, Samuel Johnson, William Collins, and Tobias Smollett. However, this was not the only important publication produced by him during this time.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} his tour as Director of Intelligence at AAF HQ {{at the end}} of 1944, Hewitt became acting Air Member for Personnel (AMP) in 1945. As AMP, Hewitt sat on the Air Board, the RAAF's controlling body that consisted of its most senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff. Along with {{the other members of the}} board, he reviewed the findings of the inquiry by Justice John Vincent Barry into the [...] "Morotai Mutiny", which had involved senior pilots of the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF) attempting to resign their commissions to protest the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to strategically unimportant ground attack missions. Hewitt recommended that the AOC No.1 TAF, Air Commodore Harry Cobby, be removed from command, along with his two senior staff officers. The majority of the Air Board saw no reason to take such action, leaving Hewitt <b>to</b> <b>append</b> a dissenting note to its decision. Drakeford supported Hewitt's position, and the three senior No.1 TAF officers were later dismissed from their posts by Air Vice Marshal Jones.|$|E

30|$|All {{protocols}} {{considered in}} this evaluation require {{that a certain}} overhead is added into beacons or data messages in order to guarantee their proper functioning. Such overhead is generally translated into a fixed number of bytes which correspond <b>to</b> extra fields <b>appended</b> <b>to</b> either beacon or data messages. However, both AMD and UV-CAST resort <b>to</b> <b>appending</b> a message list with variable length to beacons {{in order to prevent}} that repeated messages are unnecessarily disseminated in the network. In particular, AMD also includes a small variable list in data messages to guarantee that the order of rebroadcast in the neighborhood is achieved. Therefore, in this last section, we measure the message overhead required by these two protocols when increasing network densities are considered.|$|R

2500|$|Due to the {{relational}} nature of many built-in predicates, they can typically {{be used in}} several directions. For example, length/2 {{can be used to}} determine the length of a list (length(List, L), given a list List) as well as to generate a list skeleton of a given length (length(X, 5)), and also to generate both list skeletons and their lengths together (length(X, L)). [...] Similarly, append/3 can be used both <b>to</b> <b>append</b> two lists (append(ListA, ListB, X) given lists ListA and ListB) as well as to split a given list into parts (append(X, Y, List), given a list List).

2500|$|One {{source of}} {{confusion}} with {{the definition of}} the spherical harmonic functions concerns a phase factor of (−1)m for m > 0, 1 otherwise, commonly referred to as the Condon–Shortley phase in the quantum mechanical literature. In the quantum mechanics community, it is common practice to either include this phase factor in {{the definition of the}} associated Legendre polynomials, or <b>to</b> <b>append</b> it to the definition of the spherical harmonic functions. [...] There is no requirement to use the Condon–Shortley phase in the definition of the spherical harmonic functions, but including it can simplify some quantum mechanical operations, especially the application of raising and lowering operators. [...] The geodesy and magnetics communities never include the Condon–Shortley phase factor in their definitions of the spherical harmonic functions nor in the ones of the associated Legendre polynomials.|$|E
2500|$|Torah Umadda {{is closely}} {{associated}} with Yeshiva University.
