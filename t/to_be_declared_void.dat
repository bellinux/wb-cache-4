25|$|PP {{claims in}} Barcelona were cast {{off after the}} tally of Spaniards voting abroad gave an even larger margin for the PSC and secured their 14th seat in the constituency. However, the Electoral Commission found {{irregularities}} in Murcia after determining on 5 November {{that the number of}} voters and of ballot papers did not match up in fifteen wards. The new provisional results published on 6 November, which did not include the wards where irregularities had been found, awarded the last seat to PSOE by just two votes. Some IU members openly accused the PSOE of fraud, claiming that Socialist intervenors had voted twice in some wards not just in Murcia, but also in Málaga, Madrid and La Rioja—where, however, election results had not been contested—. A new tally in Murcia resulted in the Commission awarding the seat to IU on 11 November, which prompted the PSOE to announce that they would appeal to the Superior Court of Justice of Murcia. Concurrently, both the PP and the CDS alleged to have found irregularities in several polling stations in Melilla and Pontevedra, where the PSOE had also been awarded seats by a handful of votes, and asked for the vote <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>declared</b> <b>void.</b> The chaotic situation was further aggravated when, on 22 November, the PP denounced that it had found cases of duplicity of names in the Ceuta electoral register, with the party demanding for the election to be repeated in Murcia after claiming irregular procedures in the vote tally conducted by the Electoral Commission. The Spanish Attorney General, Javier Moscoso, entered the fray and stated on 24 November that the disputed Murcia seat belonged to the PSOE. On 1 December, the Superior Court of Murcia voided the election results in the constituency and required the government to call a by-election within three months.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the opening}} day of the 1833 Newmarket season, Camarine started the 1/4 {{favourite}} for the Craven Stakes, a weight-for-age race over ten furlongs. The mare won [...] "in a canter" [...] by a length from Rubini, only for the race <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>declared</b> <b>void</b> by the judge who decided that a false start had caused two horses to be left behind. The race was re-run immediately and Camarine won again, beating Lady Charlotte and Fang, the two horses who had not competed in the original race, by a margin of six lengths. The race was likened to watching [...] "countrymen on foot running after a wild stag". At the First Spring meeting no horses appeared to challenge Camarine, who was allowed to walk over in a 100 guinea King's Plate and a £50 race over the Beacon Course. Camarine made her final appearance at the Second Spring meeting in May. Running over the Beacon Course, she won the Jockey Club Plate by eight lengths from her only opponent, Lord Tavistock's seven-year-old Taurus.|$|E

50|$|Mary <b>was</b> married <b>to</b> {{her first}} husband Thomas Boyd before 26 April 1467 when she was almost {{fourteen}} years old. The Isle of Arran was given as her dowry; Thomas Boyd was subsequently created Earl of Arran. Law Castle, in Ayrshire was built for the couple. In 1469, Thomas <b>was</b> sent <b>to</b> escort King James's future consort Princess Margaret from Denmark to Scotland; during his absence the king became alienated from Thomas by the enemies of the Clan Boyd who brought false charges of treason against Thomas and his brother, Alexander. Mary, upon hearing that Thomas <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> summoned before the king and Parliament to answer the charges, immediately went to the harbour of Leith to forewarn her husband when his ship docked in July. Mary and Thomas promptly sailed to Denmark. On 22 November 1469 he was attainted, and his title, honours, and estates forfeited to the crown. She later returned to Scotland {{in an attempt to}} have her husband cleared of all charges laid against him. Upon her arrival in Scotland, King James detained her in custody in Dean Castle at Kilmarnock until her marriage was annulled.

Madero who {{had also}} been exiled into Texas, wrote the Plan de San Luis Potosí calling for the {{election}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>declared</b> null and <b>void,</b> and for Díaz <b>to</b> <b>be</b> overthrown, Alvarado recrossed the border into Mexico. He joined the revolutionary army as a captain, fighting Porfirio Díaz, {{under the command of}} Juan G. Carvajal. In February 1911, Madero and his forces attacked the city of Casas Grandes, Chihuahua and defeated Díaz's troops. A short time later, two of Madero's generals, Pascual Orozco and Pancho Villa against Madero's orders, attacked and defeated Díaz's federales at Ciudad Juárez, just across the border from El Paso, Texas. These victories led, in May 1911, to Porfírio Díaz's resignation and exile. A peace treaty was signed, Madero and his troops marched into Mexico City, elections were held and in November, 1911, Francisco Madero became Mexico's new President.|$|R
50|$|In {{the seventh}} {{year of his}} reign (c. 893), Theophano retired to a monastery in the Blachernae suburb of Constantinople. Theophano is {{considered}} particularly devoted to the church throughout her life. Whether her retirement was voluntary is left vague by both Theophanes and Symeon. Zoe replaced her in the palace and court life. There is a contradiction on her particular status from c. 893 to 897. According to Symeon, the marriage of Leo VI <b>to</b> Theophano <b>was</b> officially <b>declared</b> <b>void,</b> allowing Leo and Zoe to marry within the year. According to Theophanes, the original marriage was still valid and Zoe remained the royal mistress. Both agree however that her father Stylianos Zaoutzes rose {{to the top of}} palace hierarchy and was even awarded the new title of basileopatōr ("father of the emperor"), which he held until his death in 899. Theophano died in her monastery on 10 November 897. According to Theophanes, Leo and Zoe proceeded to marry at this point. Both Symeon and Theophanes agree that Zoe was only crowned Augusta following the death of her predecessor.|$|R

25|$|On July 7, 1983, the Reverend Roger H. Nero {{and four}} other Cherokee Freedmen were {{turned away from the}} Cherokee polls {{as a result of the}} newly instituted Cherokee voting policy. A Freedman who voted in the 1979 Cherokee election, Nero and colleagues sent a {{complaint}} to the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, claiming discrimination on the basis of race. On June 18, 1984, Nero and 16 Freedmen descendants filed a class action suit against the Cherokee Nation. Principal Chief Ross Swimmer, tribal officials, the tribal election committee, the United States, the office of the President, the Department of the Interior, the Secretary of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and three Muskogee, Oklahoma BIA officials were named as defendants. The suit sought nearly $750 million in damages and asked for the 1983 tribal election <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>declared</b> null and <b>void.</b> The court ruled against the plaintiff Freedmen because of jurisdictional issues, with the same ruling made by the Court of Appeals on December 12, 1989.

No judgment <b>was</b> made as <b>to</b> the merits of the case itself.|$|R
5000|$|Florida Attorney General Robert Butterworth in his {{advisory}} opinion to county canvassing boards: The longstanding case law in Florida [...] has {{held that the}} intent of the voters as shown by their ballots should be given effect. Where a ballot is so marked as to plainly indicate the voter's choice and intent, it should be counted as marked unless some positive provision of law would be violated. As the state has moved toward electronic voting, nothing in this evolution has diminished the standards first articulated in such judicial decisions ... that {{the intent of the}} voter is of paramount concern and should be given effect if the voter has complied with the statutory requirement and that intent may be determined. ... The Florida Statutes contemplate that where electronic or electromechanical voting systems are used, no vote <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>declared</b> invalid or <b>void</b> if there is a clear indication of the intent of the voter as determined by the county canvassing board. Conservative writer Andrew Sullivan in a contemporaneous article: There is a real issue here about what voting actually means. <b>To</b> some, voting <b>is</b> a right that should be guaranteed regardless of any incompetence, error, failure, or irresponsibility {{on the part of the}} voter. ... Others have a different view. They argue that American democracy is ... a far stricter, Lockean, Anglo-American system based on the letter of the law and a successful vote cast by a rational, responsible voter. In this constitutional system, the [...] "will of the people" [...] is an irrelevant abstraction. ... From affirmative action and hate-crime laws it's a small step to ensuring that all voters, however negligent, have their intent, however vague, reflected in the final result of an election. Florida Code Section 101.56145 states that no vote [...] "shall <b>be</b> <b>declared</b> invalid or <b>void</b> if there is a clear indication of the intent of the voter." [...] A physical mark on a ballot, at or near a designated target, is such an indication.|$|R
