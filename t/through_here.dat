In 1850, the first steam powered boat {{traveled}} <b>through</b> <b>here,</b> connecting Mexico City with Chalco. Steam powered ships remained in Xochimilco waters from then until the 1880s, when they faded from use. Before, during and after, Xochimilco continued to make more traditional rafts, canoes and trajineras, pushed along the shallow waters by a pole.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{strategic}} position between the Mexico City area and points south, armies {{associated with the}} Mexican War of Independence, Reform War and Mexican Revolution all passed <b>through</b> <b>here.</b> In 1810, Yecapixtla {{was part of the}} Jonacatepec municipality. It became an independent municipality in 1869.|$|E
25|$|The Central Ontario Railway {{arrived in}} 1900, and in 1903 a second railway, the I.B. & O., built a line <b>through</b> <b>here.</b> They were {{beneficial}} in transporting settlers and goods; the railway would operate here until 1982. Bancroft was incorporated as {{a village in}} December 1904. The first telephone in the village was at the railway station; it was connected in 1905. Electricity was not available until 1930.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{municipality}} did suffer consequences during the Mexican Revolution. Generally, it was {{sympathetic to the}} rebel cause and many joined, such as brothers Alfredo, Leonel, Hector and Homero Lopez. Because of its sympathies, various bands associated with the different forces fighting against the Porfirio Diaz government (and each other) came <b>through</b> <b>here,</b> as well as federal forces. These led to {{a certain amount of}} sacking, pillaging and vandalism.|$|E
25|$|From {{the colonial}} period to recent times, the area has been {{relatively}} isolated, keeping many of its old traditions, including economy intact. The highway connecting Mexico City to Cuautla was built <b>through</b> <b>here</b> in the latter 20th century, bringing traffic and some tourism. In 1994, the San Juan Bautista monastery was named {{as part of a}} World Heritage site officially named “Earliest 16th century monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl”.|$|E
25|$|In 1867, Maximilian I of Mexico was {{defeated}} at the Battle of the Cerro de las Campanas, where the liberals took him prisoner along with Generals Miguel Miramón and Tomás Mejía. In May 1867, the emperor {{was sentenced to}} death along with Mejía and Miramón in the Cerro de las Campanas. No major battles were fought here during the Mexican Revolution but various of the factions passed <b>through</b> <b>here</b> given the state's location between the northern states and Mexico City.|$|E

25|$|The {{modern day}} state of Hidalgo is {{located within the}} pre-Hispanic region of Mesoamerica. Numerous migrations of {{indigenous}} people took place <b>through</b> <b>here,</b> mostly arriving or passing through from the north, with many eventually settling in the Valley of Mexico. The Toltecs initially settled in Xochicoatlán, now the municipality of Molango {{at the beginning of}} the 7th century. From here they dispersed to locales such as Huejutla and Tollatzingo (now called Tulancingo) where they eventually had their capital of Tollan, today known as Tula.|$|E
25|$|Later migrations to {{the area}} brought ethnicities such as the Purépecha, the Mixtecs, the Maya and the Zapotecs who left traces on the local {{cultures}} as they established commercial centers around the 7th century. In the 8th century, Toltec influence was felt as they traveled the many trade routes <b>through</b> <b>here</b> in search of tropical bird plumage and amate paper. From the 12th century to the 15th, the various peoples of the state were influence by the Chichimecas, culminating in Aztec domination by the 15th century.|$|E
25|$|The economy spurs {{immigration}} to the city, which has seen a population growth of more than 3.5 percent a year. The industrialization of the area has attracted {{a large number of}} migrants from poorer areas of Mexico but many of these are unemployed or under-employed. This has led to an explosion of informal markets and other businesses in and around the city. Also a large number of those seeking to migrate to the northern Mexican states or to the United States pass <b>through</b> <b>here.</b> This has led to commerce being the largest economic activity in the municipality.|$|E

25|$|The area {{remained}} a farming area, mostly with family plots {{through the rest}} of the colonial period. During the Mexican War of Independence, there was restlessness here among the population, but no major incidents. In 1812, a number of natives from here fought in the war under Leonardo Bravo in other places. The municipality was mostly likely founded in 1824 along with the founding of Mexico State. U.S. troops passed <b>through</b> <b>here</b> during the Mexican-American War. In 1833, Amecameca was part of the state of Mexico in the eastern prefecture. In 1861, the settlement gained official town status from the state due to its historical and economic importance. The municipal palace was built in 1899.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the city}} is the Sierra Gorda de Querétaro, part of the Sierra Madre Oriental, was {{declared}} by UNESCO as a Biosphere Reserve. This protected area is very rugged terrain, filled with canyons, steep mountains, waterfalls and deep abysses with a total expansion of 24,803 hectares. The area contains 360 species of birds, 130 species of mammals, 71 of reptiles and twenty-three of amphibians. It also contains about thirty percent of the country's butterfly species including the endangered Humboldt, the Jaguar the Oso Negro and the Guacamaya. Plant species include 1,710 different species including endangered species and {{is considered to be}} one of the best-preserved forested areas in Mexico. The Missionary Route of Friar Junípero Serra passes <b>through</b> <b>here</b> as caves such as the Sótano del Barro are located here.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipality}} {{is located}} in the Sierra Papanteca, which is a series of low mountains with numerous valleys. The most notable peaks are the La Jarana, Pelón, El campanario, La Palma, De la Cruz, Del Jazmín, del Grillo, de Dolores and Del Clavel. Small rivers which feed into the Tecolutla, and Texistepec Rivers pass <b>through</b> <b>here,</b> such as the Tlahuanapa, Santa Agueda and the Poza Verde. The area is heavily forested with subtropical perennial foliage with trees such as the heliocarpus, laurel, cedar and ceiba. It contains 17km of mostly virgin beaches. The coastline includes the Boquila Estuary, Playa Chichinit, Rancho Playa, Playa Olmo, Tenixtepec and Boca de Lima. Most of the animal life consists of small mammals such as rabbits, raccoons and coyotes along with various species of birds and snakes. The area is considered to be tropical rainforest with most rain falling between May and August. September and October are notable for the occasional hurricane.|$|E

25|$|The {{municipality}} has {{a territory}} of 63.44km2, 81% {{of which is}} occupied by the city, which consists of 86 neighborhoods called colonias. The rest {{is part of the}} Federal Zone of the Ex-Basin of Texcoco. The municipality is flat with only one elevation reading 1,220 meters above sea level. The Los Remedios and a brand of the Churubusco River run <b>through</b> <b>here.</b> At the far northeast is a remnant of Lake Texcoco and an artificial lake was built here as part of the Parque del Puebla to serve as an ecological reserve. The climate is temperate with a fairly cold winter and rain mostly falling between June and October. Average temperature is about 15C with temperatures as high as 34C and as low as −5C. The area has little to no native wild flora and fauna {{due to the fact that}} it was underwater until the 20th century and the area is nearly completely urbanized. However, in winter a number of bird species such as cranes and storks pass through.|$|E
25|$|Arroyo Seco {{is part of}} {{the heart}} of the Sierra Gorda. This region has been {{occupied}} for about 6000 years. In the Pre Classic and Classic periods, the Sierra Gorda had a number of small cities as the climate at that time was wetter than it is now. Most of the larger cities were south of the current municipalities due to mining activities and major trade routes, but there were cities and trade routes <b>through</b> <b>here</b> as well, connecting the area mostly with Huasteca areas to the east and other areas to the north. As the climate of the Sierra Gorda dried out in the early Post Classic period, cities were abandoned for simpler hunter gatherer communities and there were migrations of Chichimecas, mostly Pames and Chichimeca Jonaz from the north. Arroyo Seco would become Pame territory. In the late pre Hispanic period, the Sierra Gorda had incursions from both the Purépecha and Aztecs from as early as 1400, attracted by the area’s mineral deposits, but neither had true dominance as the Chichimecas fiercely opposed them. In the 15th century, the area was marginally dominated by the Oxitipa dominion, which was conquered by Moctezuma Ilhuicama and the Pames. This officially converted the area into an Aztec tributary state, but the Aztecs never truly had control.|$|E
25|$|As {{municipal}} seat, Santa María Tonameca is {{the government}} authority over 150 other communities with a total population of 21,223 people (as of 2005). It is bordered to the north by the Sierra Madre del Sur and by the Pacific Ocean to the south. The highest elevations are Gordo Mountain and Gavilan Mountain. A number of rivers flow <b>through</b> <b>here</b> including the Tonameca, the San Francisco and the Cozoaltepec. There are numerous arroyos which mostly flow during the rainy season. The climate is hot and humid with temperatures rarely going below 27C and with frequent rains in the summer. Various types of palm trees grow here including the coconut palm. There are also some wood trees in the higher elevations. Fruit trees include mango, almond, avocado, orange, zapote and tamarind. Common animals found here are the iguana, deer, coyote, raccoons, armadillos, rabbits and other small mammals. There is also {{a large number of}} bird species and reptiles such as rattlesnakes, various lizards, land and sea turtles. Natural resources include the petroleum deposit called Aragón, a marble mine in Cozoaltepc, the Palmar lagoon, forested areas in the higher elevations and the beaches of Escobills, Ventanilla, Mazunte, Mariposario and San Agustinillo. Many of these beaches as well as the Chacahua estuary are considered to be ecological reserves.|$|E
