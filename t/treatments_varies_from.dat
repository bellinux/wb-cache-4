40|$|Given {{the higher}} {{efficacy}} of follitropin-beta, a new recombinant {{follicle stimulating hormone}} (r-FSH), versus urinary-FSH (u-FSH), {{the present study was}} carried out to evaluate the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) of follitropin-beta in comparison with u-FSH in women undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) in Italy. Clinical decision analysis techniques were used to retrospectively model the direct medical costs of women undergoing IVF treatment. Seven Italian experts were interviewed, using a semi-structured questionnaire, in order to adapt the results of all clinical trials to the Italian patterns of care. Three analyses were conducted considering the public, the private sectors and a mixture of them (currently representing the Italian situation). The estimated total cost of IVF <b>treatments</b> <b>varies</b> <b>from</b> 106. 9 and 211. 7 billion Lire (63. 2 and 125. 2 million US$) depending on setting and type of treatment.

Irrigation regimes consisted of three irrigation intervals (A 1 := 25 mm; A 2 := 50 mm; A 3 : = 75 mm of cumulative pan evaporation) and six irrigation levels (I 1 = 0. 50, I 2 = 0. 75, I 3 = 1. 00 and I 4 = 1. 25). In addition, I 5 =PRD 75 and I 6 =PRD 50 treatments were considered. They received 75 and 50 % of the full irrigation (I 3) treatment from alternative laterals, respectively. Also, rainfed treatment is a control plot in the experiment. Maximum and minimum yields {{were obtained from the}} A 2 I 4 and rainfed treatments, respectively in all experimental years. As the irrigation level value decreased the total yields in each irrigation interval also decreased. Seasonal irrigation amounts in the <b>treatments</b> <b>varied</b> <b>from</b> 199 mm to 563 mm in the experimental years. Seasonal evapotranspiration values in the <b>treatments</b> <b>varied</b> <b>from</b> 243 mm to 611 mm in the experimental years. Both irrigation amounts and irrigation frequencies had significantly effects on oil content of sunflower. The saturated (palmitic and stearic acid) and unsaturated (oleic and linoleic acid) fatty acid contents were significantly affected by water stress. In conclusion, A 2 I 4 irrigation regime is recommended for sunflower production in the Mediterranean region in order to attain higher yields with improved quality. In case of water shortage, A 2 I 13 irrigation regime is recommended to increase sunflower yield and quality...|$|R
