40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} maintaining, under insertions and deletions, <b>the</b> <b>union</b> of a set S of intervals on a line. We present a scheme that reports the ordered list of intervals in <b>the</b> <b>union</b> in Θ(k) time, while achieving O(log n) time in worst case for each insertion or deletion, where n {{is the number of}} intervals currently in S and k is the number of disjoint intervals in <b>the</b> <b>union.</b> <b>The</b> <b>scheme</b> uses Θ(n) space. This is an improvement upon a previous approach which uses O(log 2 n) time for each insertion or deletion. Moreover, the insertion time is provably optimal for a certain class of structures. One of the applications of our scheme is an optimal contour algorithm for iso-oriented rectangles that is competitive, and in some cases better, when compared to known algorithms. © 1991...|$|R
50|$|Once {{the test}} scheme was completed, the {{lettering}} was deemed unsatisfactory {{due to the}} word 'MISSOURI' being too large to fit on smaller four-axle carbodies. Effective May 14, 1984, <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> Pacific <b>scheme</b> was to be used, but in substitution of <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> Pacific 'Jinx' typeface, a renovated version of lettering was used. Using the type style seen on Missouri Pacific reporting marks and locomotive numbers, 'North Little Rock' lettering was used, as it fit the large and small carbodies decently. On January 1, 1986, the scheme was discontinued after the consolidation of the Missouri Pacific & Union Pacific operating departments. To this day, the paint scheme remains controversial among management, employees and rail fans.|$|R

5000|$|The first railway to be {{constructed}} was the Stafford to Shrewsbury Line, {{as it could}} be built quickly, and would be a great asset to the area. It was also stated that [...] "its construction will not involve the loss of any revenue from the canals." [...] Realignments of various railway companies resulted {{in the formation of the}} London and North Western Railway Company (LNWR) on 1 January 1846, and they saw <b>the</b> Shropshire <b>Union</b> <b>scheme</b> as a threat. They therefore offered to lease <b>the</b> Shropshire <b>Union</b> in late 1846, and an Act to authorise this was obtained in June 1847. Conditions of the lease, which was not fully completed until 25 March 1857, meant that <b>the</b> Shropshire <b>Union</b> dropped all plans for further railway expansion, but they were given a free hand to run the canals as they saw fit. However, Robert Skey, the canal manager, when he addressed a meeting in September 1861, noted that the carriage of general merchandise had suffered, as it had gradually transferred to the railways.|$|R

This paper shows that, in Romania, agriculture has an extremely special position, being one of the primary branches of material production, taking into account that the economic and social growth of the contemporary world is in close connection with the level of accomplishments in agriculture and it cannot exist outside a strong development of this production branch. Because the agricultural sector is currently growing, now, in 2014, we can see a considerably large migration from the urban area to the rural area.

5000|$|In 1997, Ayling dropped BA's {{traditional}} Union Flag tailfin livery {{in favour}} of world design tailfins, {{in an effort to}} change the airline's image to be more cosmopolitan; several members of the senior management had expressed negative opinions of nationalism within the company. This move quickly came under fire by the media for making hundreds of employees redundant while squandering money on expensive rebranding. Several influential figures, such as former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, spoke out against abandoning <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> Flag <b>scheme</b> and BA turning its back on the nation. British Airways' long-time rival, Virgin Atlantic, took advantage of BA's public relations blunder and adopted the British flag along with the slogan [...] "Britain's national flagcarrier", recognising the value and prestige of bearing the flag. Ayling eventually declaring the fleet would sport a dual livery; half <b>Union</b> Flag, half <b>the</b> world design tailfins. On 6 June 1999, he announced that all newly delivered and overhauled BA planes would bear <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> Flag, based on a design first used on Concorde; the cosmopolitan scheme was abandoned.|$|R

5000|$|In her ruling, Judge Jacobson wrote: [...] "Since Windsor, {{the clear}} trend {{has been for}} Federal {{agencies}} to limit the extension of benefits to only those same-sex couples in legally recognized marriages." [...] She pointed out {{that many of these}} agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Department of Labor, that are extending benefits to same-sex couples in a marriage, do not recognize New Jersey civil unions for benefits purposes. She pointed out that the proper issue before the court is whether the New Jersey civil <b>union</b> <b>scheme</b> is unconstitutional because [...] "of the manner it is applied and incorporated by the Federal government." [...] She reasoned that this disparate treatment of civil unions versus marriage raised an equal protection claim under both state and Federal constitutions if a state action led to this situation. Because New Jersey enacted a civil union statute that created a [...] "parallel" [...] structure to marriage and the N.J. Supreme Court deferred to the legislature on the actual name of the legal status granted to same-sex couples [...] "as long as the classifications do not discriminate arbitrarily among persons similarly situated," [...] Windsor changed the significance of <b>the</b> state's civil <b>unions</b> <b>scheme.</b> She determined that [...] "the parallel legal structures created by the New Jersey Legislature no longer provided same sex couples with equal access to the rights and benefits enjoyed by married heterosexual couples, violating the mandate of Lewis and the New Jersey Constitution's equal protection guarantee." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{implementation}} of <b>the</b> European <b>Union</b> <b>scheme</b> of preferential tariffs for developing countries under the Generalised System of Preferences during the past forty years shows that the scheme has made at best a modest contribution towards increasing the export earnings of India and other beneficiary countries covered by the standard GSP. The benefits for these countries have been constrained by the shallow cuts in tariffs for important products {{and the practice of}} product/sector graduation. The policy of differentiation among beneficiaries, which is a central pillar of the EU scheme, has resulted in deeper and wider preferences for GSP + countries and LDCs and limited the benefits for other developing countries. The reduction of MFN tariffs after successive rounds of multilateral trade negotiations has diminished the value of the GSP concessions. If there is accord in the current trade talks in the WTO, the general level of MFN tariffs will be in the range of 3 - 4 per cent, rendering preferential tariffs even less consequential. It is unfortunate that at present, the prospect for conclusion of the Doha Round appears to be dim. In light of this, perhaps a better bet is forging ahead with the bilateral trade and investment agreement that India and the EU have been negotiating since 2007. A deal on this front might bring home advantage on the tariff front vis-à-vis the EU that is bigger than what the Doha Round can offer...|$|R

40|$|First {{available}} online: 2 November 2015 This article {{starts out}} from the general question of how fields of regulation have impacted on the private law relationships between individuals, i. e., in competition law and capital market law. It states that the impact is sometimes more direct, as in capital market law, sometimes less direct and felt only after much more time, like in competition law, {{but that it is}} always present. Hence, the first result is obvious: <b>the</b> new Banking <b>Union</b> <b>scheme</b> will impact also on private law relationships. While this is already discussed in some specific areas—namely organisation of banks and recovery and resolution of banks (with the bail-in mechanism) —and while these areas are addressed in this article as well, the question most thoroughly dealt with here is whether such impact will be felt more generally and how it should be shaped. It concerns all bank-client relationships—mostly contract law—, the question of how much influence is welcome, and in which ways it can be channelled. The article provides ample material as to where similar questions have already been discussed in neighbouring fields of law and sees the regulatory package introduced under the term 'Banking Union' as one which will have a considerable amount of private law repercussions...|$|R
