5|$|Prior to Mubarak's speech, {{contradictory}} {{reports from}} various media sources {{around the world}} stated that either Suleiman or Tantawi was expected to take over.

5|$|After {{the recent}} events, Queen Margaret still {{considered}} Warwick {{a threat to}} the throne, and cut off his supplies. In August 1457, however, a French attack on the English seaport of Sandwich set off fears of a full-scale French invasion. Warwick was again funded to protect the garrison and patrol the English coast. In disregard of royal authority, he then conducted highly successful acts of piracy, against the Castilian fleet in May 1458, and against the Hanseatic fleet a few weeks later. He also used his time on the Continent to establish relations with Charles VII of France and Philip <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> <b>of</b> Burgundy. Developing a solid military reputation and with good international connections, he then brought a part of his garrison to England, where he met up with his father and York in the summer of 1459.|$|E
5|$|After their father's {{death in}} 1906, Hogg and her {{brothers}} {{tried to sell}} the Varner plantation, but a provision in his will specified that the land be kept for 15years. On January 15, 1918, oil {{was found on the}} Varner plantation. A second strike the following year provided oil income amounting to $225,000 a month shared among the four siblings. According to Hogg biographer Gwendolyn Cone Neely, the Hoggs did not believe that the oil money was rightfully theirs, as it had come from the land and not hard work, and they were determined to use it for <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>of</b> Texas.|$|E

5|$|Another {{traditionally}} respected {{group which}} Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims {{who have been}} on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without any interest in <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>of</b> humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging high interest rates for a loan, and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is waiting on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, in the opinion of Kartini et al., it is as if he is deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, Chamarro {{performed}} a delicate balancing act. Her choice {{to lead the}} Assembly, , {{was rejected by the}} UNO vote, which chose Myriam Arguello and Chamorro kept her word not to go against the vote. Her Vice President-elect Virgilio Godoy was in favor of hard-line policies to exclude the Sandinistas, but Chamorro retained Daniel Ortega's brother, Humberto Ortega, as a military leader, granting herself the position of Defense Minister and naming Humberto to second-in-command as the Chief of Staff. For this, Chamorro's critics accused her of supporting the Sandinistas, but it proved to be a valuable political move, as it demonstrated that, for <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>of</b> the nation, she was willing to compromise in ways that fostered reconciliation. She also appointed three FSLN cabinet members, including one for agrarian reform.|$|E

Other scholars, however, hold that all possibilities must be examined to see if <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waqf can be used at all, exhausting all methods of exploitation before the termination. Thus, land, according to such jurists, can never become extinguished.|$|R
5|$|In 2003, Chia mooted {{the idea}} that Singaporeans {{should be able to}} borrow from their own Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings to tide over periods of {{financial}} difficulty. His rationale was that if individuals could borrow from their own CPF accounts to buy depreciating property and money-losing stocks, there was no reason why they {{should not be allowed to}} do so to pay for bills. Dr. Ong Seh Hong, MP for Aljunied GRC, opposed the view, stating that it was important and for <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>of</b> Singapore that Singaporeans were independent individuals who could assume the risks and successes of their investments and be self-sufficient.|$|E

5|$|John Constantine, {{the main}} {{character}} of Hellblazer, was portrayed {{as a kind of}} confidence man and occult detective who did morally questionable things, arguably for the greater good. He usually triumphed through guile, deceit, and misdirection, but often made more enemies in the process than he defeated. Indeed, it was a common theme in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>of</b> mankind, Constantine was often manipulative and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of ghosts.|$|E

5|$|Michael {{was born}} under {{the family name}} of Pătraşcu. In 1601, during a stay in Prague, he was portrayed by the painter Aegidius Sadeler, who {{mentioned}} on the portrait the words aetatis XLIII ("in the 43rd year of life"), which indicates 1558 as the year of Michael's birth. Very {{little is known about}} his childhood and early years as an adult. He is argued by most historians to have been the illegitimate son of Wallachian Prince Pătraşcu cel Bun, (Pătrașcu <b>the</b> <b>Good)</b> <b>of</b> the Drăculeşti branch of the House of Basarab, while others believe he merely invented his descent in order to justify his rule. His mother was Theodora Kantakouzene, a member of the Kantakouzenoi, a noble family present in Wallachia and Moldavia, and allegedly descended from the Byzantine Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos.|$|E
5|$|The Catechism {{explains}} that this commandment regulates worldly goods, and forbids unjustly taking, using or damaging those {{that belong to}} someone else.

The Catechism addresses the concept of human stewardship of God's creation in its explanation of the seventh commandment and forbids abuse of animals and the environment.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} {{marriage}} is a social and spiritual bond {{between a man and}} a woman, ordered towards <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>of</b> the spouses and procreation of children; according to Catholic teachings on sexual morality, it is the only appropriate context for sexual activity. A Catholic marriage, or any marriage between baptised individuals of any Christian denomination, is viewed as a sacrament. A sacramental marriage, once consummated, cannot be dissolved except by death. The Church recognises certain conditions, such as freedom of consent, as required for any marriage to be valid; In addition, the Church sets specific rules and norms, known as canonical form, that Catholics must follow.|$|E

5|$|The all-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, re-established in December 2002, was {{conducting}} {{a review of}} the entire Constitution.

Among the many issues raised by the committee were the definition of the family and the rights of same-sex couples to marry.|$|E
5|$|The sitter is unknown, {{although}} some art historians have speculated on her identity. On {{the grounds of}} similarity of facial features, writer Wilhelm Stein suggested in the early 20th century {{that she might be}} Marie de Valengin, the illegitimate daughter of Philip <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> <b>of</b> Burgundy. However, this is a contentious assertion and not widely held. Because her hands are shown as resting on the painting's lower frame, art historians generally accept that this was an independent portrait, rather than a devotional work. It is possible that it was intended as a pendant to a picture of the woman's husband, however no other portrait has been suggested as a likely companion.|$|E
