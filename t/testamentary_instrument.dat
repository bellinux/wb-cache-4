By the 7 and 8 statute of the 14 of George, chapter 29, s. 22, it is enacted that if any person shall either during the lifetime or after the death of any person steal, or for any fraudulent purpose conceal any will, codicil, or other <b>testamentary</b> <b>instrument,</b> they shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and being convicted thereof, be liable to various punishments. And by the same statute, chapter 29, s. 63, it says if any credible witness shall prove upon oath before a justice of the peace, a reasonable cause to suspect that any person has in his possession, or on his premises, any property whatsoever, or in respect to which any such offence (such as stealing a will, &c.,) shall have been committed, the justice may grant a warrant to search for such property, {{as in the case of}} stolen goods. Now by this Act it is clear that a warrant could be obtained upon an affidavit that you believed, as you do believe, that the will exists; but that would not allow you to pull the house to pieces, and it is quite certain that in no other way would you discover a chamber built for the purpose of concealment, and which you say baffled the priest-hunters of the old time--men who were pretty well accustomed to the finding of this sort of hiding-place, and who knew exactly where they were likely to be situated. You would never find it; and even while you were searching for it, Miss Harmer might enter by the secret door--wherever that may be--and abstract or destroy the will, without your being one bit the wiser; or, at any rate, she would be certain after you had given up the hopeless search and left, to destroy the will to prevent the possibility of your ever trying again with better fortune. No, your best course is to find out, first, where the chamber is; next, how to get into it; and when these two points are discovered, we can arrange about going in and taking possession of the will without asking any one's leave in the matter. That is, I believe, our only chance of recovering it--by strategy. Take one of the servants into your pay, and get her to search for the chamber. This I leave to you, as of course you are acquainted with some of the domestics. I do not know that I have anything more which I can suggest at present. Should anything strike me, I will write from town, and, as I go by the early train, I will now, with your permission, retire to bed. You will of course write to me immediately you find out anything which may seem to you to have the smallest bearing upon the affair. I should especially advise that you do not hint to any one your belief in the existence of the will, as it may get to Miss Harmer's ears; and although, if she believes that no search is being made for it, she may be content to let it remain for years concealed as at present, you may be assured that should she believe that you are working to find it, either she or the priest will destroy it at once." [...] We all agreed in the propriety of following this advice, and then separated for the night.|$|E

50|$|Wills, Estates And Succession Act of British Columbia (WESA) is {{a provincial}} statute that governs {{the law of}} {{inheritance}} in British Columbia, Canada. The bill was introduced in Legislative Assembly of British Columbia on September 24, 2009 and received royal consent on October 29, 2009. WESA amalgamated {{and in some cases}} replaced five earlier pieces of legislation. These include: Estate Administration Act RSBC 1996, c. 122,Probate Recognition RSBC 1996, c. 376, Wills Act RSBC 1996, c. 489, Wills Variation Act RSBC 1996, c. Law and Equity Act RSBC 1996, c. 253, s. 46, 49, 50 & 51 and Survivorship and Presumption of Death Act RSBC 1996, c. 444. WESA has awarded the courts with curative discretion under S.5; which allows for validatation of <b>testamentary</b> <b>instruments</b> that are deemed previously defective.|$|R

40|$|A {{consensus}} {{has begun}} to develop in the case law, the academic commentary, and the statutory reform movement that a testator’s provision in her will mandating arbitration of any challenge to the will should not be enforceable against a beneficiary who has not agreed to the arbitration provision, at least where the will contestant, by her contest, seeks to increase her inheritance outside the will. Grounding this consensus is the widespread understanding that a will is not a contract. This Article seeks to challenge both the understanding that the will is not a contract and the opposition to enforcement of testator-compelled arbitration provisions that arises from that understanding. This Article argues that the will {{is part of an}} implied unilateral contract between the testator and the state in which the state offers to honor the testator’s donative intent and the testator accepts and provides consideration for the offer by creating and preserving wealth. Importantly, the greater contract respecting donative freedom of which the will is a part also includes a provision providing for the distribution of an individual’s intestate property in line with that individual’s imputed intent should the individual fail to execute an effective estate plan. Similar to the testator, the property owner who has failed to make an effective estate plan accepts this offer of intestate distribution through her industry and thrift. This Article’s theory borrows from the law respecting implied unilateral contracts arising from employee handbooks in concluding that it should be of no moment that the property owner is unfamiliar with the specifics of the state probate code. Rather, the critical factor should be that the state has, through its offer to respect donative intent, created an atmosphere that is “instinct with an obligation” and that encourages diligence and the prudent management of wealth. The conclusion that the will is a contract between the testator and the state grounds this Article’s additional argument that the Federal Arbitration Act and state arbitration statutes require enforcement of a testator-compelled arbitration provision contained in a will even against a beneficiary who has not agreed to the arbitration provision. Settled arbitration law in conjunction with third-party beneficiary theory or direct benefits estoppel theory supports binding the beneficiary to the will’s arbitration contract. A virtue of this Article’s theory that the will and the intestacy statute are both clauses in a greater donative freedom contract is that the analysis escapes the limitations inherent in the dominant understanding that a will’s arbitration clause, if enforceable at all, can be enforced only against a beneficiary who seeks by her will contest to increase her inheritance under the will as opposed to circumstances in which the donee seeks to increase her intestate inheritance. According to the conventional wisdom, even if arbitration clauses are enforceable in some <b>testamentary</b> <b>instruments,</b> they govern only a narrow range of claims. This Article’s implied unilateral contract theory goes further and expands the universe of arbitrable contests. Specifically, this Article’s theory is the first theory that encompasses even a will contest that seeks to render the will a complete nullity...|$|R
50|$|Where {{the stolen}} item {{is not a}} <b>testamentary</b> <b>instrument</b> and is not worth more than $5000 it is known as Theft Under $5000 and is a hybrid offence, meaning {{that it can be}} treated either as an indictable offence or a less serious summary {{conviction}} offence, depending on the choice of the prosecutor.|$|E
5000|$|Even when a {{testator}} {{are found}} to have lacked testamentary capacity due to senility, loss of memory due to the aging process, infirmity or insanity, courts will sometimes rule that the testator had a [...] "temporary period of lucidity" [...] or a [...] "lucid moment" [...] {{at the time of}} the execution of the <b>testamentary</b> <b>instrument.</b> Such finding will validate a will that would otherwise be denied probate.|$|E
5000|$|To be {{effective}} as a testamentary document, a [...] "holographic" [...] will must be signed by its author. Unlike a typewritten or word-processed [...] "formal" [...] will, where usually two disinterested witnesses are required to attest to the author's signing or [...] "execution" [...] of the document, a holographic will does not require any witnessing or notarization (an accepted form of witnessed certification of authenticity) {{in order to be}} a proper and valid <b>testamentary</b> <b>instrument</b> (document) having full legal force and effect.|$|E
50|$|A will can be revoked by a {{subsequent}} valid will or by a codicil. A codicil is {{a supplement to}} a will: a <b>testamentary</b> <b>instrument</b> intended to alter an already executed will. Later wills are obviously the later wills {{in a series of}} wills executed by the same person. A valid will loses all legal force and effect—that is, its validity—if it is revoked by the testator before his death. In revoking a previous will, the testator must intend to revoke the previous will; if accidentally done, the revocation is not effective.|$|E
5000|$|The {{testator}} devises {{a general}} type of property, and then changes the specific items of property within that category. For example, Joey {{writes in his}} will, [...] "I leave my car to Rachel". Joey drives a 1974 AMC Gremlin {{at the time of}} the <b>testamentary</b> <b>instrument,</b> but later sells the Gremlin and purchases a 2016 Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupé with suicide doors and teak paneling. Because Joey bought a new car to get a more comfortable ride, rather than to change a will without going through the testamentary formalities, the gift to Rachel remains enforceable.|$|E

5000|$|If {{the estate}} is not {{automatically}} devised to the surviving spouse {{in this manner}} or through a joint tenancy, and is not held within a trust, {{it is necessary to}} [...] "probate the estate", whether or not the decedent had a valid will. A court having jurisdiction of the decedent's estate (a probate court) supervises probate, to administer the disposition of the decedent's property according to the law of the jurisdiction and the decedent's intent as manifested in his <b>testamentary</b> <b>instrument.</b> Distribution of certain estate assets requires selling illiquid assets, including real estate. There are exceptions for smaller estates. For example, California has a “Small Estate Summary Procedure” to allow the summary transfer of a decedent’s asset without a formal Probate proceeding. The dollar limit by which the Small Estate procedure can be effectuated is $150,000.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{provides}} the first analysis of wrongful death damages {{from the perspective}} of individual justice accounts of tort law. There is a widespread belief that wrongful death damages are incoherent. Currently, tort law responds only to the harms of the decedent’s living relatives. Drawing on deterrence rationales, Cass Sunstein, Eric Posner, and others have recommended altering these damage awards so that they respond to the harms of the decedent herself by providing “lost life” damages. This Article offers a different and powerful new foundation for lost life damages rooted in corrective justice and its main competitor, civil recourse. At first blush, both corrective justice and civil recourse appear to undercut lost life damages. Once properly understood, however, each theory supports a life-projects approach to lost life damages. The normative underpinnings of these tort theories suggest that tort damages should respect the ends that the victim set for herself and should refrain from valuing the victim only as a means. Our current tort practices do the reverse. The victim is valued only through the effects she had on others—only as a means of her family’s flourishing—rather than as an equal person with her own life projects. Lost life damages can respect the victim’s ends in several ways. One possibility would be awarding money to her estate. The victim’s will or other <b>testamentary</b> <b>instrument</b> would then direct that award to further whatever life projects she felt were important enough to survive her death...|$|E
