5|$|Like all metal type revivals, {{reviving}} Gill Sans {{in digital}} form raises several decisions of interpretation, such as {{the issue of how}} to compensate for the ink spread that would have been seen in print at small sizes more than larger. As a result, printed Gill Sans and its digital facsimile may not always match. The digital release of Gill Sans, like many Monotype digitisations, has been criticised, in particular for excessively tight letter-spacing and lack of optical sizes: with only one design released that has to be used at any text size, it cannot replicate <b>the</b> <b>subtlety</b> <b>of</b> design and spacing of the metal type, for which every size was drawn differently. In the hot metal era the structure of the font varied by size as is normal for metal type, with wider spacing and other detail changes at smaller text sizes. In the phototype period Monotype continued to offer two or three sizes of master, but all of this subtlety was lost on transfer to digital. To replicate this, it is necessary to make manual adjustment to spacing to compensate for size changes, such as expanding the spacing and increasing the weight used at smaller sizes.|$|E

25|$|Shakespeare's Elizabethan tragedies (including {{the history}} plays with tragic designs, such as Richard II) {{demonstrate}} his relative independence from classical models. He takes from Aristotle and Horace {{the notion of}} decorum; with few exceptions, he focuses on high-born characters and national affairs as the subject of tragedy. In most other respects, though, the early tragedies are far closer to the spirit and style of moralities. They are episodic, packed with character and incident; they are loosely unified by a theme or character. In this respect, they reflect clearly the influence of Marlowe, particularly of Tamburlaine. Even in his early work, however, Shakespeare generally shows more restraint than Marlowe; he resorts to grandiloquent rhetoric less frequently, and his attitude towards his heroes is more nuanced, and sometimes more sceptical, than Marlowe's. By {{the turn of the}} century, the bombast of Titus Andronicus had vanished, replaced by <b>the</b> <b>subtlety</b> <b>of</b> Hamlet.|$|E

500|$|Dylan critic Michael Gray also praises <b>the</b> <b>subtlety</b> <b>of</b> the song. Gray {{acknowledges}} {{that it is}} difficult to say what this song is [...] "about", since it is at once indefinable and precise. For Gray, its principal achievement lies in the way it confuses categories, using language to be simultaneously serious and flippant, delicate and coarse, and mixing up [...] "abstract neo-philosophy and figurative phraseology".|$|E
500|$|The critic John Ruskin {{compared}} <b>the</b> <b>subtlety</b> <b>of</b> {{his drawing}} {{to that of}} Holbein, J. M. W.

His fame faded as illustration became more widespread and more mechanical, but twentieth-century artists such as Gwen Raverat (née Darwin) continued to admire his skill, and work by artists such as Paul Nash and Eric Ravilious {{has been described as}} reminiscent of Bewick.|$|E

500|$|Highway 61 Revisited is {{the sixth}} studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. It was {{released}} on August 30, 1965, by Columbia Records. Having until then recorded mostly acoustic music, Dylan used rock musicians as his backing band on every track of the album, except for the closing 11-minute ballad, [...] "Desolation Row". Critics {{have focused on the}} innovative way in which Dylan combined driving, blues-based music with <b>the</b> <b>subtlety</b> <b>of</b> poetry to create songs that captured the political and cultural chaos of contemporary America. Author Michael Gray has argued that in an important sense the 1960s [...] "started" [...] with this album.|$|E
500|$|Critics lauded the game's narrative. Kimberley Wallace of Game Informer {{wrote that}} the [...] "fragmented" [...] {{delivery}} of the story [...] "works to its benefit". She appreciated <b>the</b> <b>subtlety</b> <b>of</b> the narrative, and the ambiguity surrounding the ending. Polygons Megan Farokhmanesh noted that Her Story [...] "nails the dark, voyeuristic nature of true crime". Chris Schilling of The Daily Telegraph {{was impressed by the}} coherence of the narrative, [...] "even when presented out of order". Eurogamer's Simon Parkin found the effects of the narrative to be similar to well-received HBO thrillers, particularly in terms of audience attention. Stephanie Bendixsen of Good Game was disappointed that large plot points were revealed early in the game, but attributed this to the uniqueness of each players' experience.|$|E
500|$|Monotype's original, early {{digitisation}} of Bembo {{was widely}} seen as unsuccessful. Two main problems have been cited with it: it was much lighter in type colour than the original metal type, perhaps through failure to anticipate the reduced ink spread on modern printing equipment. In addition, the digital Bembo {{was based on the}} 9 pt metal drawings, creating a font with different proportions to the metal type in the point sizes at which Bembo was most often used in books. This made the proportions of the digital font appear wrong, failing to match <b>the</b> <b>subtlety</b> <b>of</b> the metal type and even phototype, which was released in three different optical sizes for different print sizes.

The Daily Telegraphs Tim Martin praised the characters' interactions, and Eurogamers Stace Harman felt that Left Behind improves the understanding of Joel and Ellie's relationship. Kotakus Kirk Hamilton described Ellie and Riley's kiss as [...] "video gaming's latest breakthrough moment", declaring it [...] "a big deal". Keza MacDonald of IGN wrote that the kiss was [...] "so beautiful and natural and funny that [...] was left dumbstruck".

500|$|Greil Marcus {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} disregarding one's initial reading of the song. [...] "The first impression is that Bob Dylan is setting up the usual private scene: 'I'll sit here and watch the river flow.' Well, that's certainly a boring idea. It's the implicit message of just about everything James Taylor has ever written". He went on to describe how Dylan explores the difficulty of retaining privacy while making public art; the singer is {{coming to terms with}} unwanted attention inherent in stardom, without giving up his connection to his fans. Marcus argued that the reason the single was not a hit in the US was because [...] "the time has passed when people are interested in hearing Bob Dylan say he'll just sit there and watch the river flow... even though that's not quite what he's saying". For Marcus, [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] is a compelling work, but <b>the</b> <b>subtlety</b> <b>of</b> the song may have prevented it from reaching a wide audience.|$|E
500|$|Ward {{does not}} believe this {{a trick of the}} eye {{resulting}} from loss of perspective towards the high reaches of the panel. Instead he sees it as a subtle reference to the iconography and mythology of the Book of Genesis' Tree of life, which he describes here as [...] "reborn in Christ's death". He does acknowledge <b>the</b> <b>subtlety</b> <b>of</b> the illusion, and the fact that neither of the two well known near copies include the motif. The idea of flowers shown as if sprouting {{from the top of the}} cross may have been borrowed from Masaccio's c.1426 Crucifixion, where flowers are placed on the upper portion of the vertical beam of the cross. Ward concludes than van Eyck took the idea even further by showing the flowers emanating from another source, and sought to depict the actual moment where the tree of life is reborn and [...] "the cross comes to life and sprouts flowers as one watches".|$|E
500|$|On 24 July 1999, Climbié {{was taken}} by Kouao to the accident-and-emergency {{department}} at North Middlesex Hospital with severe scalding to her head and other injuries. The hospital {{found no evidence of}} scabies. Consultant Mary Rossiter felt Climbié was being abused but still wrote 'able to discharge' on her notes. According to Maureen Ann Meates, another doctor at the hospital, when Rossiter had written that note, she had noted that Climbié was exhibiting signs of neglect, emotional abuse and physical abuse. Later, in the inquiry, Rossiter said that by writing 'able to discharge', she did not mean she wanted Climbié to go home, merely that she was physically fit to leave. Garnham said, [...] "quite how <b>the</b> <b>subtlety</b> <b>of</b> that distinction was to be ascertained from the notes is far from obvious". Rossiter admitted to the inquiry that she had expected police and social services to follow up on the case. For a brief period while Climbié was in hospital, Enfield social services took up the case before passing it to Haringey.|$|E
