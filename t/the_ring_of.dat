5|$|After Hardy's client Adam Cole {{defeated}} Jay Briscoe {{to become}} the Undisputed Ring of Honor World Champion, Cole presented Jay Briscoe's custom made world championship belt (Briscoe claimed to still be <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> <b>of</b> Honor champion as he forfeited the title due to injury and never officially lost it) to Hardy as a show of appreciation, Hardy re-branded the belt as <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> <b>of</b> Honor Iconic (Innovative Creator and Originator of a New-Found Industry Champion) Championship, however, the title has not been sanctioned as an official championship by Ring of Honor. On June 22, 2014 at Best in the World, Hardy and Michael Bennett were defeated by The Briscoe Brothers in a no disqualification tag team match.

5|$|As protons {{cross the}} {{membrane}} through the channel {{in the base}} of ATP synthase, the FO proton-driven motor rotates. Rotation might be caused by changes in the ionization of amino acids in <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> c subunits causing electrostatic interactions that propel <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> c subunits past the proton channel. This rotating ring in turn drives the rotation of the central axle (the γ subunit stalk) within the α and β subunits. The α and β subunits are prevented from rotating themselves by the side-arm, which acts as a stator. This movement of the tip of the γ subunit within the ball of α and β subunits provides the energy for the active sites in the β subunits to undergo a cycle of movements that produces and then releases ATP.|$|E

Also, like those <b>of</b> Uranus, Neptune's <b>rings</b> probably resulted from the collisional fragmentation of onetime inner moons. Such events create moonlet belts, which act as the sources <b>of</b> dust for <b>the</b> <b>rings.</b> In this respect <b>the</b> <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Neptune are similar to faint dusty bands observed by Voyager 2 between <b>the</b> main <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Uranus.|$|R
5|$|During the Bronze Age fewer {{large stone}} {{structures}} were built although the great ceremonial circles continued in use as metalworking was slowly introduced to Britain from Europe over a lengthy period.

5|$|The story {{follows a}} nameless protagonist {{who lives in}} near-future Tokyo. When a portal {{to the realm of}} demons is opened, United States {{officials}} order a nuclear attack on Tokyo. Transported with two other supporting characters thirty years into the future, the protagonist finds the Earth ruined by a demon invasion, which is now the stage for an escalating conflict between the Order of Messiah and <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> <b>of</b> Gaea, conflicting cults who wish to bring about kingdoms for their respective patron deities (YHVH and Lucifer). The story is influenced by moral decisions the protagonist makes, aligning him either with the Order, <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> <b>of</b> Gaea, or setting him up as an independent agent.|$|E

5|$|When {{they return}} to Tokyo, thirty years have passed, and the world lies in ruins. Both demons and humans live in Tokyo, and two warring groups have formed: the Order of Messiah, who is {{building}} a cathedral and wants {{to bring about the}} Thousand-Year Kingdom, and <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> <b>of</b> Gaea, who intends to summon Lucifer and wants freedom. While exploring the city, the Hero meets the Heroine, who has been reincarnated, and she joins the group. They keep traversing the ruins, until the Chaos Hero decides to leave, and fuses himself with a demon to gain power; they move on without him, until the Law Hero's soul gets taken by an attacking demon. The Chaos Hero joins <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> <b>of</b> Gaea, while the Law Hero's soul gets reincarnated as the new Messiah. Both try to get the Hero to join their respective side; players can choose to support either, or to reject both. Regardless of what they choose, the Order of Messiah finishes building their cathedral, and a great flood appears, drowning people who were not inside the cathedral at the time. Survivors set up camps inside the cathedral; the Order of Messiah takes control of the top floors, while <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> <b>of</b> Gaea occupies the basement floors.|$|E

5|$|A charred {{hazelnut}} shell, {{recovered in}} 2007 during excavations in Tankerness on the Mainland has been dated to 6820–6660 BC indicating {{the presence of}} Mesolithic nomadic tribes.

The village of Skara Brae, Europe's best-preserved Neolithic settlement, {{is believed to have been}} inhabited from around 3100 BC. Other remains from that era include the Standing Stones of Stenness, the Maeshowe passage grave, <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> <b>of</b> Brodgar and other standing stones. Many of the Neolithic settlements were abandoned around 2500 BC, possibly due to changes in the climate.|$|E
5|$|After rescuing Emilio, Gamma {{arranges}} to have <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> <b>of</b> the Dead {{removed from}} his body by an old friend, mad scientist Nazna Gemini. The characters are brought to Gemini's lab by Angelle Cooney, a young girl {{with the power of}} teleportation. Once there, Gemini agrees to operate to remove the ring from Emilio in exchange for a year of experimentation rights on Wolfina. Due to the series' early cancellation, Zombiepowder. is ended without a solid conclusion. The final chapter shows Gamma and Smith leaving Elwood and Wolfina behind as they depart the Gemini Laboratory, whose staff have just begun the operation to save Emilio. It is left ambiguous whether Elwood chooses to follow Gamma and Smith, stay with Wolfina and Emilio, or become a powder hunter in his own right.|$|E

5|$|As a whole, <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> system <b>of</b> Uranus {{is unlike}} either <b>the</b> faint dusty <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter or <b>the</b> broad and complex <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Saturn, {{some of which}} are {{composed}} of very bright material—water ice. However, there are similarities with some parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter <b>ring</b> system; <b>the</b> Saturnian F <b>ring</b> and <b>the</b> Uranian ε <b>ring</b> are both narrow, relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons.
