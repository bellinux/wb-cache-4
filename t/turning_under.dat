25|$|The Type C barge was {{specifically}} converted {{to carry the}} Panzer II amphibious tank (Schwimmpanzer). Because of the extra width of the floats attached to this tank, cutting a broad exit ramp into {{the bow of the}} barge was not considered advisable as it would have compromised the vessel's seaworthiness to an unacceptable degree. Instead, a large hatch was cut into the stern, thereby allowing the tanks to drive directly into deep water before <b>turning</b> <b>under</b> their own motive power and heading towards shore. The Type C barge could accommodate up to four Schwimmpanzern in its hold. Approximately 14 of these craft were available by the end of September.|$|E
25|$|West of Times Square, {{the tracks}} curve sharply {{downward}} before <b>turning</b> <b>under</b> 11th Avenue. The tracks end at 24th Street, although the last station is at 34th Street. This segment was built {{as part of}} the extension of the Flushing Line west to Manhattan's Far West Side (see below). A decommissioned lower level at the IND Eighth Avenue Line's 42nd Street–Port Authority Bus Terminal station formerly blocked the way; it had been rumored that the IND built it to keep the IRT from extending the Flushing Line, although no blueprints indicate that the IRT planned such an expansion. While some originally questioned the necessity of the plan, with London receiving the 2012 Summer Olympics, the city pursued it as a means to enable the redevelopment of the far West Side under the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, {{the plan}} for the Fourth Avenue subway {{included}} a spur via 86th Street running through Dyker Heights and Bensonhurst. At this time the spur was not authorized, {{but at the time}} it was viewed as a necessary part of the transportation plan for the area. The line was planned as a four-track line from Dean Street to Fort Hamilton, before being fed by a subway line going under the East River, and by a line over the Manhattan Bridge. An additional two-track spur was to begin at 37th Street before running under private property and 38th Street, before connecting with the South Brooklyn Railway. An additional two-track spur would branch off between 63rd and 64th Streets before connecting with the Sea Beach Railway. South of 65th Street the main line was planned to continue as a four-track line to 100th Street. Another proposal for a branch line was for a subway via New Utrecht Avenue. The line, consisting of four tracks, would have branched off at 40th Street before <b>turning</b> <b>under</b> New Utrecht Avenue and 86th Street to a point between 23rd and 24th Avenues. From there the line would have become an elevated line running to Coney Island. A spur of the Fourth Avenue line via 86th Street would have merged in here.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the song, {{the narrator}} {{addresses}} an unidentified girl, asking [...] "When {{will you come}} with me", and lamenting {{the fact that she}} laughs at him for having nothing to his name. He tells her he wants to give her his hopes and bring her freedom, that [...] "the earth is <b>turning</b> <b>under</b> your feet" [...] and [...] "the waters of life are flowing free", yet she persists in scorning him. He asks why she laughs at the pack he carries on his back, and he wonders why he keeps on going, with nothing to his name. At last, he tells her that he has waited for a long time, and that this is his final plea: he wants to grab her by the hands, to [...] "take you away with me". As he sees her hands tremble, and her eyes [...] "overflow with tears", he asks her, [...] "Do you really mean to tell me, you love me as I am?" ...|$|E

60|$|Again he came down; {{prepared}} for shooting, though both pale and lame; but he quietly put aside all expostulations, walking on until, about fifty {{yards from the}} house, a pebble, <b>turning</b> <b>under</b> the injured foot, caused such severe pain that he could but just stagger to a tree and sit down.|$|E
60|$|He was {{interrupted}} by feeling a gigantic hand on his shoulder. <b>Turning,</b> <b>under</b> a sort of confused impression that necromancy was actually abroad in the place, he {{found that he was}} in the hands of a sorcerer no less dangerous and powerful than Ishmael Bush. The file of the squatter's well-armed sons, that was seen issuing from behind the still standing tent of Mahtoree, explained at once, not only the manner in which their rear had been turned, while their attention had been so earnestly bestowed on matters in front, but the utter impossibility of resistance.|$|E
60|$|The heavy brogans on the man's feet {{made him}} appear clumsy-footed, but he swung {{down from the}} giddy height as lightly and airily as a {{mountain}} goat. A rock, <b>turning</b> <b>under</b> {{his foot on the}} edge of the precipice, did not disconcert him. He seemed to know the precise time required for the turn to culminate in disaster, and in the meantime he utilized the false footing itself for the momentary earth-contact necessary to carry him on into safety. Where the earth sloped so steeply that it was impossible to stand for a second upright, the man did not hesitate. His foot pressed the impossible surface for but a fraction of the fatal second and gave him the bound that carried him onward. Again, where even the fraction of a second's footing was out of the question, he would swing his body past by a moment's hand-grip on a jutting knob of rock, a crevice, or a precariously rooted shrub. At last, with a wild leap and yell, he exchanged the face of the wall for an earth-slide and finished the descent in the midst of several tons of sliding earth and gravel.|$|E

60|$|This is Belgium, reader. Look! don't {{call the}} picture a flat or a dull one--it was neither flat nor dull {{to me when}} I first beheld it. When I left Ostend on a mild February morning, and found myself {{on the road to}} Brussels, nothing could look vapid to me. My sense of {{enjoyment}} possessed an edge whetted to the finest, untouched, keen, exquisite. I was young; I had good health; pleasure and I had never met; no indulgence of hers had enervated or sated one faculty of my nature. Liberty I clasped in my arms for the first time, and the influence of her smile and embrace revived my life like the sun and the west wind. Yes, at that epoch I felt like a morning traveller who doubts not that from the hill he is ascending he shall behold a glorious sunrise; what if the track be strait, steep, and stony? he sees it not; his eyes are fixed on that summit, flushed already, flushed and gilded, and having gained it he is certain of the scene beyond. He knows that the sun will face him, that his chariot is even now coming over the eastern horizon, and that the herald breeze he feels on his cheek is opening for the god's career a clear, vast path of azure, amidst clouds soft as pearl and warm as flame. Difficulty and toil were to be my lot, but sustained by energy, drawn on by hopes as bright as vague, I deemed such a lot no hardship. I mounted now the hill in shade; there were pebbles, inequalities, briars in my path, but my eyes were fixed on the crimson peak above; my imagination was with the refulgent firmament beyond, and I thought nothing of the stones <b>turning</b> <b>under</b> my feet, or of the thorns scratching my face and hands.|$|E

The [...] "Tourist" [...] had effective streamlining, perhaps unsurprising in view of its aircraft ancestry, and although it had only a , 9.5 bhp 4-stroke engine, it was capable of sustaining speeds of up to 70 mph (official figures 58 mph), given time to get there.|$|E

50|$|It {{is usually}} most {{desirable}} {{to have the}} car adjusted for {{a small amount of}} understeer, so that it responds predictably to a turn of the steering wheel and the rear wheels have a smaller slip angle than the front wheels. However this may not be achievable for all loading, road and weather conditions, speed ranges, or while <b>turning</b> <b>under</b> acceleration or braking. Ideally, a car should carry passengers and baggage near its center of gravity and have similar tire loading, camber angle and roll stiffness in front and back to minimise the variation in handling characteristics. A driver can learn to deal with excessive oversteer or understeer, but not if it varies greatly {{in a short period of}} time.|$|E

5000|$|The {{problem with}} the blunt-nose system is that the {{resulting}} design creates very little lift, meaning the vehicle has problems maneuvering during re-entry.

After a single low-earth orbit, the launching point will be over 1000 km to the east of the spacecraft by the time it flies over again after one full orbit. A considerable amount of research was dedicated to combining the blunt-nose system with wings, leading {{to the development of the}} lifting body designs in the U.S.|$|E

5000|$|The {{modified}} prototype underwent combat evaluation on the Western Front by Oberleutnant Otto Parschau in October 1915, {{making it}} the first twin-gun fighter in service. Leading German ace Oswald Boelcke evaluated the E.IV at Fokker's Schwerin factory in November. The pilots discovered that mounting the much heavier Oberursel U.III onto the Eindecker airframe did not produce a better aircraft - one pilot described it as [...] "practically a flying engine." [...] The inertial and gyroscopic forces of the spinning mass made the E.IV less manoeuvrable than the E.III and any loss of efficiency from the notoriously unreliable engine made the aircraft virtually uncontrollable, requiring the engine to be switched off. <b>Turning</b> <b>under</b> such conditions was exceedingly difficult because the E.IV still used wing warping instead of ailerons. Furthermore, the engine worked well when new, but lost power {{after only a few}} hours of operation.|$|E
