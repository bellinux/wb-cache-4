5|$|As {{the freeways}} in the Lansing area were {{completed}} in the 1960s through the 1980s, the highways through downtown changed designations. The section of I-96 west of Lansing opened in December 1962. In 1973, M-78 was converted to a freeway near the Flint area, and from Olivet southwest of Lansing to the new freeway, the old highway was redesignated Temporary I-69 (Temp. I-69). Additional segments of I-69 north of Lansing were finished in 1984 and 1987. I-69 was routed over I-96 and the new freeway north of Lansing, and the business loop was designated along M-43 and the former Temp. I-69 in 1987 after <b>that</b> <b>second</b> segment opened.|$|E
5|$|Between the Octagon and {{the main}} {{gatehouse}} in the north wall was a barbican, of which little survives– {{just a piece of}} the west wall– although the structure was originally two storeys high. The surviving fabric includes a slot for a portcullis for the barbican's north gate, although there are no hinges for gates. The base of a garderobe demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>second</b> storey would have provided space for habitation, probably a guard room. Drawings from the late 18th century show the ground floor of the barbican still standing and includes detail such as vaulting inside the passageway.|$|E
5|$|Brunner's term as Ohio Secretary of State ends in 2011 and {{was up for}} {{re-election}} in 2010 along with other Ohio statewide offices. In January, rumors that were eventually confirmed began circulating <b>that</b> <b>second</b> term Republican United States Senator George Voinovich would not run {{for re-election}} in 2010. Brunner's name was mentioned as a potential Democratic candidate for the seat. On January 23, 2009, Brunner and Ohio Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher met to discuss the possibility that either of them would run, but did not confirm any decision or leanings to the media.|$|E

5|$|On March 8, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Second</b> Sons pre-order sales had surpassed those of The Last of Us in the United Kingdom. Two special edition versions of the game were produced; pre-ordered and first-run copies of the game received the Limited Edition, which includes the Coles Legacy mission pack that explain story events between Infamous 2 and Second Son. The Collector's Edition includes a unique box cover, a replica of Delsin's beanie, eight pins from his vest, an exclusive in-game vest, and a D.U.P.-themed patch. All pre-ordered copies of the game included four in-game vests for Delsin.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{revolves}} around the characters of Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter, ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and ex-spouses on the run, with Adrianne Palicki and Nick Blood reprising their respective roles of Morse and Hunter from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.. Delroy Lindo, Fernanda Andrade, and Oded Fehr also starred in the pilot. A television series featuring Morse entered development for ABC Family in July 2011, but never materialized. The character subsequently appeared in the second season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. along with Hunter, and plans for a spin-off centered on the duo, with Palicki and Blood attached, began in April 2015. The series would {{have been based on}} storylines occurring at the end of <b>that</b> <b>second</b> season, but ABC passed on the project.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} other {{highways}} that bore the M-51 designation. The first connected Holland and Grand Rapids {{with the birth}} of the highway system in 1919. After the creation of the United States Numbered Highway System in 1926, the number was moved to a different highway in The Thumb area. <b>That</b> <b>second</b> highway was scaled back and later decommissioned in the 1960s. The current highway dates back to 1971 when the southern end of M-40 was rerouted, and the previous alignment was given the M-51 moniker. It was extended to the state line in 1998 to complete the current highway.|$|E

50|$|A {{telephone}} {{call to the}} station between 11:35 and 11:40 warned <b>that</b> a <b>second</b> bomb had been planted in the building, but police initially reported that no such device was found. A report released later that day said <b>that</b> a <b>second</b> device {{had been found in}} a locker near the one in which the first bomb was placed, and a third announcement at 4:45 pm again issued the story <b>that</b> no <b>second</b> bomb had been found.|$|R
5|$|Trapped {{refugees}} began {{piling up}} bodies as barricades {{and tried to}} dig into the ground to hide. Some managed to escape that first night, while U.S. troops turned searchlights on the tunnels and continued firing, said Chung Koo-ho, whose mother died shielding him and his sister. By the second day, the gunfire was reduced to potshots and occasional fusillades when a trapped refugee moved or tried to escape. Some also recall planes returning <b>that</b> <b>second</b> day to fire rockets or drop bombs. Racked with thirst, survivors resorted to drinking blood-filled water from a small stream running under the bridge.|$|E
5|$|In September and October the {{battalion}} {{took part in}} important actions {{as part of the}} offensive in the Munassib Depression and at Miteiriya Ridge during the Second Battle of El Alamein. On 2 November {{the battalion}} supported the final breakthrough by Allied forces that decided the outcome of the battle. Casualties were high during this time and three of its commanding officers were either killed or wounded between July and November 1942. Nevertheless, the battalion remained in the fighting and in March 1943, at Medenine it undertook a defensive role before switching to the offensive at Point 209 in the Tebaga Gap, where it was responsible for almost completely destroying a German panzer grenadier battalion. It was during this action <b>that</b> <b>Second</b> Lieutenant Moana-Nui-a-Kiwa Ngarimu performed the deeds that led to him being posthumously decorated with the Victoria Cross. The battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Bennett, also received the Distinguished Service Order for his leadership during the attack.|$|E
5|$|<b>That</b> <b>second</b> column, {{commanded}} by Soult and including Gen. Honoré Gazan's VCorps division, was escorting the French siege-train and therefore {{had to take}} a longer, more practicable route into Extremadura. Bad weather and the desertion of the Spanish drivers caused the artillery train to become separated from the escorting infantry, a problem that was further complicated when the column was threatened by 5,000 Spanish troops under Gen. Francisco Ballesteros. When confronted by Marshal Mortier, Ballesteros retreated without suffering serious harm but remained a threat {{to the rear of the}} French column. For this reason Soult directed Gazan's infantry to head off the Spanish force and protect the delayed siege-train, while he himself continued onward to Almendralejo with his cavalry. As a result, Soult finally joined Latour-Maubourg on 6 January with only a fraction of his original column and no heavy artillery.|$|E

5000|$|Consider {{the actions}} of the second player given any {{arbitrary}} proposal by the first player (<b>that</b> gives the <b>second</b> player more than zero). Since the only choice the second player has at each of these points in the game is to choose between something and nothing, one can expect <b>that</b> the <b>second</b> will accept. Given <b>that</b> the <b>second</b> will accept all proposals offered by the first (<b>that</b> give the <b>second</b> anything at all), the first ought to propose giving the second as little as possible. This is the unique subgame perfect equilibrium of the Ultimatum Game. (However, the Ultimatum Game does have several other Nash equilibria which are not subgame perfect.) ...|$|R
