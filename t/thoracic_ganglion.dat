40|$|Background : Unilateral lumbar sympathectomy {{involved}} {{that increased}} skin temperature on the ipsilateral foot and simultaneously decreased temperature on contralateral foot. In the neurolyzed extremity, blood flow increased {{at the expense}} of contralateral blood flow. The compensatory distribution of blood is called “borrowing-lending”　phenomenon (DeBakey. 1947), on which few reported on the account of thoracic sympathetic neurolysis, hence effects of volume preload on the phenomenon were elucidated under radiofrequency neurolysis of <b>thoracic</b> sympathetic <b>ganglion</b> in anesthetized dogs. Method : The 30 dogs were divided into three groups following pre-neurolysis level of right atrial pressure (RA) : 1) hypovolemic group (n= 10) : RA< 3 mmHg, 2) normovolemic group (n= 10) : 3 mmHg≦RA≦ 6 mmHg, 3) hypervolemic group (n= 10) : 6 mmHg<RA. Skin temperature on the bilateral costal arch region and hemodynamic variables were measured before and after neurolysis. Results : No significant changes of hemodynamic variables were observed in all groups. Regional skin temperature of the neurolyzed side increased significantly 5 and 20 minutes after neurolysis. The contralateral skin temperature simultaneously decreased in hypovolemic and normovolemic groups, but we found no change of temperature in hypervolemic group. Conclusion : These results suggest that volume loading plays an important role to antagonize the “borrowing-lending”　(Compensatory phenomenon) produced by　radiofrequency neurolysis of <b>thoracic</b>　sympathetic <b>ganglions...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: The aim of {{this study}} was to clarify the {{anatomic}} variations of the intrathoracic nerve of Kuntz, and this should help delineate the resection margins during video-assisted thoracic sympathectomy. Methods: Sixty-six thoracic sympathetic chains of 39 adult Korean cadavers were dissected on both sides of the thorax in 27 cadavers (54 sides) and on one side in 12 cadavers (12 sides). Results: The intrathoracic nerve was observed in 45 (68. 2 %) sides and was present bilaterally in 48. 1 % of cadavers. No intrathoracic nerve or ascending ramus communicans arising from the second thoracic nerve was observed in only 5 (7. 6 %) sides. The diameter of the intrathoracic nerve was 1. 25 ± 0. 55 mm on average. The arising point of the intrathoracic nerve from the second thoracic nerve was 7. 3 mm on average from the sympathetic trunk. Presence of the stellate ganglion was noted in 56 (84. 8 %) sides, and 6 (9. 1 %) sides showed a single large ganglion formed by the stellate and the second thoracic sympathetic ganglia. The second <b>thoracic</b> sympathetic <b>ganglion</b> was most commonly located (50 %) in the second intercostal space. Conclusion: The anatomic variations of the intrathoracic nerve of Kuntz and the second <b>thoracic</b> sympathetic <b>ganglion</b> were characterized in human cadavers. It is hoped that this study will help to improve the recurrence of symptoms caused by the intrathoracic nerve in an upper thoracic sympathectomy for hyperhidrosis.

40|$|Neurolytic <b>thoracic</b> {{sympathetic}} <b>ganglion</b> blockade {{has only}} relatively recently been introduced as a clinical therapeutic strategy. To cast {{light on the}} efficacy of this procedure, data for 111 patients (21 - 78 years old, 132 affected extremities/sites) were analyzed. Methods : A comparative assessment was performed with fluoroscopic and contrast-radiographic observation of the blockade using chemical or thermocoagulative approaches, with anterior paratracheal or posterior paravertebral injection sites and upper-thoracic or lower-thoracic regions. Results : Chemical neurolytic sympathetic ganglion blockade was applied to patients 217 times, and radiofrequency thermocoagulation at 90 ℃ for 180 seconds a total of 64 times. Statistically, chemical neurolytiques proved longer lasting than thermocoagulation neurolytiques but {{no significant differences between}} anterior and posterior approaches were observed regarding the period of influence. Lower-thoracic injection was associated with a longer effective duration than evident with the upper-thoracic group. Complications were observed with chemical neurolytique including two cases of pneumothorax, two cases of Horner's syndrome and one case of nerve injury, despite radiographic evaluation. Conclusions : Chemical or radiofrequency thermocoagulation neurolytique can be extensively applied to patients suffering from persistent intractable pain in the cervical or thoracic regions, but performance under fluoroscopy is an absolute requiement. 個人の特定が出来ると思われる写真が掲載されているため本文PDFの登録はな...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We have {{isolated}} a cDNA coding for a putative invertebrate-type dopamine receptor (Peadop 2) from P. americana brain {{by using}} a PCR-based strategy. The mRNA is present in samples from brain and salivary glands. We analyzed {{the distribution of the}} PeaDOP 2 receptor protein with specific affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies. On Western blots, PeaDOP 2 was detected in protein samples from brain, subesophageal <b>ganglion,</b> <b>thoracic</b> ganglia, and salivary glands. In immunocytochemical experiments, we detected PeaDOP 2 in neurons with their somata being located at the anterior edge of the medulla bilaterally innervating the optic lobes and projecting to the ventro-lateral protocerebrum. In order to determine the functional and pharmacological properties of the cloned receptor, we generated a cell line constitutively expressing PeaDOP 2. Activation of PeaDOP 2 -expressing cells with dopamine induced an increase in intracellular cAMP. In contrast, a C-terminally truncated splice variant of this receptor did not exhibit any functional property by itself.

40|$|The steal {{phenomenon}} {{between the}} bilateral sides following unilateral sympathetic denervation can {{be influenced by}} intravascular blood volume. We studied the changes in skin temperature {{as an indicator of}} this phenomenon induced by unilateral lumbar or <b>thoracic</b> sympathetic <b>ganglion</b> blockade in dogs under various hemodynamics. Each of 30 dogs in lumbar and thoracic experiments, which were divided into three groups according to mean right atrial pressure (RAP, mmHg) as hypovolemic (RAP＜ 3; n= 10), normovolemic (3 ≦RAP≦ 6; n= 10) and hypervolemic (RAP＞ 6; n= 10), underwent'unilat- eral high-frequency thermocoagulation in lumbar (L 5 -L 7) or thoracic (Th 7 -Th 11) sympathetic ganglia. Skin temperature at planta of both hindlimbs or bilateral costal arches was compared among three groups for 60 minutes following･either blockade. Ipsilateral skin temperature rose in all groups (p＜ 0. 05). Contralateral skin temperature fell significantly only in the hypovolemic and the normovolemic groups (p＜ 0. 05), but not in the hypervolemic group. After lumbar sympathetic blockade, the changes is the contralateral skin temperature for 60 minutes, expressed {{as a percentage of the}} respective control value, were significantly larger (p＜ 0. 05) in the hypovolemic (- 6. 4 ± 1. 8 %) and the normovolemic (- 6. 0 ± 2. 2 %) groups than that in the hypervolemic group (+ 0. 1 ± 1. 7 %). After thoracic sympathetic blockade, this percentage change was significantly differ- ent (p＜ 0. 05) among the hypovolemic (- 1. 2 ± 0. 7 %), the normovolemic (- 0. 7 ± 0. 6 %) and the hypervolemic (+ 0. 0 ± 0. 4 %) groups. We conclude that the steal phenomenon may be influenced by intravascular volume. Therefore, it is necessary to sufficiently understand the patient's systemic hemodynamics or peripheral circulation in performing unilateral sympathetic ganglion blockade. Further- more, a pretreatment such as a preoperative volume loading can be beneficial, especially for the hypovolemic patient who has bilateral vascular disorders...|$|R
40|$|Enhancement of {{vitellogenin}} synthesis by serotonin in {{the giant}} freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii (de Man). Zoological Studies 48 (5) : 597 - 606. Serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 HT) plays {{important roles in}} regulating diverse physiological processes in crustaceans. The stimulatory effect of 5 HT on vitellogenin (Vg) synthesis in the giant freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii (de Man) is presented in this paper. During a 16 d experimental period, hemolymph was collected from both intact and bilateral eyestalk-ablated prawns 2 d after the administration of 5 HT, which was periodically injected into prawns on day 2 and every 4 th day thereafter. The vitellogenin concentration in the hemolymph was quantified using an ELISA technique. The results showed that 5 HT enhanced the process of Vg synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. The fact that 5 HT is able to stimulate Vg synthesis in eyestalk-ablated prawns {{in a similar manner}} as in intact prawns, and that the synthesis and release of Vg from the hepatopancreas and the increment of total Vg mRNA in hepatopancreas were all enhanced by 5 HT stimulation in the presence of ganglion tissues in vitro suggest that the stimulatory action of 5 HT on Vg synthesis is mediated through a factor, likely a vitellogenesis-stimulating hormone in brain, and <b>thoracic</b> and abdominal <b>ganglion</b> tissues...|$|R

Pev-SK 2 (pQFDEY(SO 3 H) GHMRF-NH 2) fully complies with the typical sulfakinin Core sequence and is blocked by a pyroglutamyl residue. Synthetic analogs (sulfated and unsulfated) were synthesized and the tyrosyl sulfations were confirmed by myotropic activity studies and co-elution with the native fractions. Pev-SK I is the first disulfated neuropeptide elucidated in the phylum of the arthropoda, with the only other reported disulfated neuropeptide. called cionin. found in a protochordate. The similarities in amino acid sequence and posttranslational modifications of the crustacean sulfakinins and protochordate cionin provide further evidence for the hypothesis stating that gastrin/CCK. cionin, and sulfakinins originate from a common ancestral gastrin/CCK-like peptide.

60|$|While {{the brain}} is {{registering}} sensations, the four dynamic centers are coming into perfect relation. Or rather, as we see, the reverse is the case.

60|$|And how? As we know, a child {{lives from}} the great field of dynamic {{consciousness}} established between the four poles of the dynamic psyche, two great poles of sympathy, two great poles of will.

At these four poles the whole flow, both within the individual and from without him, of dynamic consciousness and dynamic creative relationship is centered. These four first poles constitute the first field of dynamic consciousness for the first twelve or fourteen years {{of the life of}} every child.|$|E
40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} distribution of three peptides, DSK I, DSK II, and DSK 0, encoded by the Drosophila melanogaster drosulfakinin (Dsk) gene, have been examined in the central nervous system. DSK I and DSK II have a -RFamide C-terminus and are structurally similar to sulfakinin peptides; in contrast, DSK 0 contains -SFamide and is not structurally similar to sulfakinins. Antisera specificities were determined by {{the design of the}} antigens and confirmed by dot blot analysis and preincubation with peptides prior to their use in immunocytochemistry. The distribution of immunoreactivity suggests that all three DSK peptides are processed from the polypeptide precursor and expressed in many of the same cells.

Cells in the brain lobe, optic lobe, subesophageal <b>ganglion,</b> <b>thoracic</b> ganglia, and the eighth abdominal neuromere contain DSK-immunoreactive materials. Immunoreactive fibers project from some cells and extend into the brain and ventral ganglion with regions of extensive arborization. DSK 0 immunoreactivity provides initial evidence for the presence of a -SFamide peptide in neural tissue. The observed expression of DSK-immunoreactive materials throughout development in numerous cells of the central nervous system suggests that DSK peptides may serve as hormones, modulators, or transmitters involved in several functions...|$|R

Maternal tanezumab administration appeared to increase stillbirths and infant mortality, but no consistent pattern of gross and/or microscopic change was detected to explain the mortality. Offspring exposed in utero were evaluated at 12 months of age using light microscopy (all tissues), stereology (basal forebrain cholinergic and dorsal root ganglia neurons), and morphometry (sural nerve). Light microscopy revealed decreased number of neurons in sympathetic ganglia (superior mesenteric, cervicothoracic, and ganglia in the thoracic sympathetic trunk). Stereologic assessment indicated an overall decrease in dorsal root <b>ganglion</b> (<b>thoracic)</b> volume and number of neurons in animals exposed to tanezumab 4 mg/kg (n 9) and 30 mg/kg (n 1). At all tanezumab doses, the sural nerve was small due to decreases in myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Existing axons/ myelin sheaths appeared normal when viewed with light and transmission electron microscopy. There was no indication of tanezumab-related, active neuron/nerve fiber degeneration/necrosis in any tissue, indicating decreased sensory/ sympathetic neurons and axonal changes were due to hypoplasia or atrophy.

60|$|And then smell. The {{nostrils}} are {{the great}} gate from the wide atmosphere of heaven to the lungs. The extreme sigh of yearning we catch through the mouth. But the delicate nose advances always into the air, our palpable communicator with the infinite air. Thus {{it has its}} first delicate root in the cardiac plexus, the root of its intake. And {{the root of the}} delicate-proud exhalation, rejection, is in the <b>thoracic</b> <b>ganglion.</b> But the nostrils have their other function of smell. Here the delicate nerve-ends run direct from the lower centers, from the solar plexus and the lumbar ganglion, or even deeper. There is the refined sensual intake when a scent is sweet. There is the sensual repudiation when a scent is unsavoury. And just as the fullness of the lips and the shape of the mouth depend on the development from the lower or the upper centers, the sensual or the spiritual, so does the shape of the nose depend on the direct control of the deepest centers of consciousness. A perfect nose is perhaps the result of a balance in the four modes. But what is a perfect nose!--We only know that a short snub nose goes with an over-sympathetic nature, not proud enough; while a long nose derives {{from the center of the}} upper will, the <b>thoracic</b> <b>ganglion,</b> our great center of curiosity, and benevolent or objective control. A thick, squat nose is the sensual-sympathetic nose, and the high, arched nose the sensual voluntary nose, having the curve of repudiation, as when we turn up our nose from a bad smell, but also the proud curve of haughtiness and subjective authority. The nose is one of the greatest indicators of character. That is to say, it almost inevitably indicates the mode of predominant dynamic consciousness in the individual, the predominant primary center from which he lives.--When savages rub noses instead of kissing, they are exchanging a more sensitive and a deeper sensual salute than our lip-touch.|$|E

It is passive, but cold and negative. It is the great force of our day. From the ganglion of the shoulders, also, the child breathes and his heart beats. From the same center he learns the first use of his arms. In the gesture of sympathy, from the upper plane, he embraces his mother with his arms.

60|$|Nervous System and Organs of Sense.--In {{most of the}} genera, {{there are}} six main ganglia, namely, the supra-oesophageal, and five {{thoracic}} ganglia; but in Pollicipes mitella there are only four thoracic ganglia. Of these, the first thoracic or infra-oesophageal ganglion is considerably {{the largest and most}} massive; it is squarish, or oval, or heart-shaped; it presents no trace of being formed by the union of two lateral ganglia. Two great nerves spring from its under side (A), represented in the woodcut on page 49, by dotted lines, and run straight down amongst the viscera in the prosoma: these nerves are about as large as those forming the collar and those running to the second ganglion; hence, six great nerves meet here, two in front, two behind, and two on the under side. At the anterior end, over the junction with the collar chord, three equal-sized nerves rise on each side, with a fourth, smaller one, outside; these go to the trophi and to the two olfactory sacks. At the posterior end, on each side, a pair of nerves branch out rectangularly, one of which (a,) goes to the first cirrus, and there divides into two branches; of these, the upper runs up the cirrus, and the lower one downwards. The other nerve (b), proceeding on each side from this first <b>thoracic</b> <b>ganglion,</b> runs to the muscles beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus. The collar surrounding the oesophagus is generally very long, sometimes equalling the whole thoracic chord; at a middle point, a small branch is sent off, and at the anterior end (e, e), close to the supra-oesophageal ganglia, double or treble fine branches run to the true ovaria, lying close to {{the upper end of the}} stomach. The four (or only three) other thoracic ganglia, when viewed as transparent bodies, are seen to be solid; but in some of the genera, as in Conchoderma, the outline plainly shows, that each consists of a lateral pair fused together. The second <b>thoracic</b> <b>ganglion</b> (B) is rather small; it is either close to the first, as in Pollicipes mitella and Lepas fascicularis, or far distant, as in Ibla. The third (C) and fourth are of about the same size with the second: these three ganglia send large branches to the second, third, and fourth pair of cirri: other minute branches spring from their under sides, and from the intermediate double chords. The fifth ganglion is larger and longer than the three preceding ones, and gives off nerves to the fifth and sixth pair of cirri; it is clearly formed by the union of the fifth, with what ought to have formed a sixth ganglion. The two nerves going to the sixth cirrus give off on their inner sides, each a great branch to the penis. In Pollicipes mitella, in which there are only four instead of five thoracic ganglia, it is evident from the outline and position of the nerves going to the fourth pair of cirri, that the fourth ganglion is fused into the fifth, itself, as we have just seen, normally composed of two consecutive ganglia. In this Pollicipes there is other evidence of concentration in the nervous system, for none of the ganglia show signs of being formed of lateral pairs; the second is close to the first; and the abdominal double chord is in part separated by a mere cleft; lastly, as we shall immediately see, the same remark is applicable to the supra-oesophageal ganglia.|$|E
60|$|The {{eyes are}} the third great gateway of the psyche. Here the soul {{goes in and}} out of the body, as a bird flying forth and coming home. But the root of {{conscious}} vision is almost entirely in the breast. When I go forth from my own eyes, in delight to dwell upon the world which is beyond me, outside me, then I go forth from wide open windows, through which shows the full and living lambent darkness of my present inward self. I go forth, and I leave the lovely open darkness of my sensient self revealed; when I go forth in the wonder of vision to dwell upon the beloved, or upon the wonder of the world, I go from the center of the glad breast, through the eyes, and who will may look into the full soft darkness of me, rich with my undiscovered presence. But if I am displeased, then hard and cold my self stands in my eyes, and refuses any communication, any sympathy, but merely stares outwards. It is the motion of cold objectivity from the <b>thoracic</b> <b>ganglion.</b> Or, from the same center of will, cold but intense my eyes may watch with curiosity, as a cat watches a fly. It may be into my curiosity will creep an element of warm gladness in the wonder which I am beholding outside myself. Or it may be that my curiosity will be purely and simply the cold, almost cruel curiosity of the upper will, directed from the ganglion of the shoulders: such as is the acute attention of an experimental scientist.|$|E
60|$|There is a {{wonderful}} complementary duality between the voluntary and the sympathetic activity on the same plane. But between the two planes, upper and lower, there is a further dualism, still more startling, perhaps. Between the dark, glowing first term of knowledge at the solar plexus: I am I, all is one in me; and the first term of volitional knowledge: I am myself, and these others are not as I am;--there {{is a world of}} difference. But when the world changes again, and on the upper plane we realize the wonder of other things, the difference is almost shattering. The <b>thoracic</b> <b>ganglion</b> is a ganglion of power. When the child in its delicate bliss seeks the mother and finds her and is added on to her, then it fulfills itself in the great upper sympathetic mode. But then it relinquishes her. It ceases to be aware of her. And if she tries to force its love to play upon her again, like light revealing her to herself, then the child turns away. Or it will lie, and look at her with the strange, odd, curious look of knowledge, like a little imp who is spying her out. This is the curious look that many mothers cannot bear. Involuntarily it arouses a sort of hate in them--the look of scrutinizing curiosity, apart, and as it were studying, balancing them up. Yet it is a look which comes into every child's eyes. It is the reaction of the great voluntary plexus between the shoulders. The mother is suddenly set apart, as an object of curiosity, coldly, sometimes dreamily, sometimes puzzled, sometimes mockingly observed.|$|E

50|$|The suboesophageal {{ganglion}} (acronym: SOG; synonym: subesophageal ganglion) of arthropods {{and in particular}} insects {{is part of the}} arthropod central nervous system (CNS). As indicated by its name, it is located below the oesophagus, inside the head. As part of the ventral nerve cord, it is connected (via pairs of connections) to the brain (or supraoesophageal ganglion) and to the first <b>thoracic</b> <b>ganglion</b> (or protothoracic ganglion). Its nerves innervate the sensory organs and muscles of the mouthparts and the salivary glands.|$|E
50|$|The {{thoracic}} segments {{have one}} ganglion on each side, which are connected into a pair, one pair per segment. This arrangement is also {{seen in the}} abdomen {{but only in the}} first eight segments. Many species of insects have reduced numbers of ganglia due to fusion or reduction. Some cockroaches have just six ganglia in the abdomen, whereas the wasp Vespa crabro has only two in the thorax and three in the abdomen. Some insects, like the house fly Musca domestica, have all the body ganglia fused into a single large <b>thoracic</b> <b>ganglion.</b>|$|E
