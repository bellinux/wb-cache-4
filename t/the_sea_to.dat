5|$|A {{traditional}} {{story from}} western Arnhem Land tells of Black Cockatoo {{and her husband}} Crow, who are Bird-people, sprouting black feathers after becoming afflicted with a sickness from across <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> the north. In fear of being buried underground, they transform into birds and fly high in the sky.|$|E

5|$|Nineteenth-century sources {{refer to}} Palestine as {{extending}} from <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> the caravan route, presumably the Hejaz-Damascus route {{east of the}} Jordan River valley. Others {{refer to it as}} extending from <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> the desert. Prior to the Allied Powers victory in World War I and the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire, which created the British mandate in the Levant, most of the northern area of what is today Jordan formed part of the Ottoman Vilayet of Damascus (Syria), while the southern part of Jordan was part of the Vilayet of Hejaz. What later became Mandatory Palestine was in late Ottoman times divided between the Vilayet of Beirut (Lebanon) and the Sanjak of Jerusalem. The Zionist Organization provided its definition of the boundaries of Palestine in a statement to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.|$|E

5|$|Admiralty {{law is the}} {{particular}} body of national laws applied to maritime questions and offenses, as the uncertainty of sea voyages has caused <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> {{be viewed as a}} unique jurisdiction since antiquity. Rhodian, Roman, Byzantine, Trani, and Amalfian laws were important influences on the French, Genovese, and Hanseatic codes which established the first English courts of admiralty. Unlike the usual English common law system, the courts of admiralty hewed closer to Continental practice, leaving it open for abuse that contributed to the American Revolution. The adoption of the present constitution reintroduced admiralty law to the United States, but with a relatively larger sphere for trials by jury.|$|E
5|$|After a {{hard but}} {{inconclusive}} fight during which Admiral Brézé was killed, the French fleet withdrew to Toulon leaving <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> the Spanish, who {{decided not to}} pursue them to relieve Orbetello. The land forces disembarked by Count of Linhares a few days later, however, failed to dislodge the French lines, and the siege could be undertaken until 24 July, when another Spanish army led by the Marquis of Torrecuso and the Duke of Arcos, which {{had come from the}} Kingdom of Naples across the Papal States, defeated the besieging French troops, forcing them to retreat with heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|Black drongos were {{introduced}} {{just before the}} Second World War from Taiwan to the island of Rota {{to help in the}} control of insects. It is believed that they dispersed over <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> the island of Guam in the 1950s. By 1967, they were the fourth most commonly seen birds in roadside counts on Guam and are today the most abundant bird there. Predation by and competition from black drongos have been suggested as factors in the decline of endemic bird species such as the Rota bridled white-eye and the Guam flycatcher.|$|E

5|$|Crickets have a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, being {{found in all}} parts of the world with the exception of cold regions at latitudes higher than about 55° North and South. They have colonised many large and small islands, sometimes flying over <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> reach these locations, or perhaps conveyed on floating timber or by human activity. The greatest diversity occurs in tropical locations, such as in Malaysia, where 88 species were heard chirping from a single location near Kuala Lumpur. A greater number than this could have been present because some species are mute.|$|E
5|$|Geological {{mapping of}} the volcano has {{indicated}} {{that as much as}} 80% {{of the volcano}}'s surface has been topped by lava flows during the last 5,000years, entirely composed of shield alkalic basalt. More than half of this is under 3,000years old, and about 12% is less than 1,000years of age. Between the years 1700 and 2016, eruptions originated from six vents; four of these lava flows poured into <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> the west coast.|$|E
5|$|In many decapods, {{the first}} (and {{sometimes}} the second) pair of pleopods are specialised {{in the male}} for sperm transfer. Many terrestrial crustaceans (such as the Christmas Island red crab) mate seasonally and return to <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> release the eggs. Others, such as woodlice, lay their eggs on land, albeit in damp conditions. In most decapods, the females retain the eggs until they hatch into free-swimming larvae.|$|E

5|$|It is {{said that}} this is the place from where the Hindu god Rama built a bridge across <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> Lanka to rescue his wife Sita from her {{abductor}} Ravana. The Ramanathaswamy Temple, dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, is located at the centre of the town and is closely associated with Rama.

5|$|Johngarthia lagostoma {{lives in}} burrows among vegetation, at altitudes {{of up to}} , {{emerging}} at night to feed on plant matter and occasionally on animals. From January to March there is an annual migration to <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> release the planktonic larvae. The species was first described (as Gecarcinus lagostoma) by Henri Milne-Edwards in 1837 from material sent {{to him by the}} naturalists Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard, collected by the French ship Astrolabe.|$|E
5|$|Robert Hichens {{applied to}} {{transfer}} from the Territorial Army to the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) {{in the summer}} of 1930, and eventually transferred to the Royal Naval Volunteer Supplementary Reserve in 1936, which was formed from yachtsmen sufficiently knowledgeable about <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> be considered suitable for a commission. After the declaration of war he was ordered to join the training depot HMS King Alfred on 27 October 1939, and after passing an interview and medical was promoted to sub lieutenant RNVR, completing his training in six weeks instead of the normal three months.|$|E

5|$|The {{amount of}} {{trackage}} for cargo was increased, {{with a wide}} section of land mass being filled into <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> create a larger rail and port facility at Brattøra, though the filling of {{a large part of}} the seabed to create artificial land. The railways allowed the transshipment of cargo from ships from Northern Norway to rail, as well as from rail from Central Sweden to ships to the British Isles. The port was supplemented by a new line to Ilsvika would allow the loading of ore there. The suggestion to build double track to Leangen was dropped.|$|E

Their {{trenches}} stretched from <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> Walkers Ridge and included two outposts, No.1 Post and No.2 Post. The regiment took over on the extreme right, with one squadron in the front line, one squadron in the support trench and the third squadron as the reserve. Next in line to their right, was the Auckland Mounted Rifles, and then the Wellington Mounted Rifles on the left. However, the regiment {{had to wait until}} it got dark before sending men forward to man the two outposts.|$|E

5|$|According to Hindu mythology, {{the lands}} of Kerala were {{recovered}} from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parasurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu (hence, Kerala is also called Parasurama Kshetram ("The Land of Parasurama")). Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded {{as far as it}} reached. According to legend, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari. The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so Parasurama invoked the Snake King Vasuki, who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land. The legend was later expanded, and found literary expression in the 17th or 18th century with Keralolpathi, which traces the origin of aspects of early Kerala society, such as land tenure and administration, to the story of Parasurama. In medieval times Kuttuvan may have emulated the Parasurama tradition by throwing his spear into <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> symbolise his lordship over it.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Fire Emblem games, Path of Radiance {{takes place in}} a continuity and setting separate {{from the rest of the}} series. The game's setting is the continent of Tellius, inhabited by two species: the humanoid Beorc, and the shape-shifting Laguz. According to legend, the goddess who made the world created Beorc in her image, and created the Laguz to fill the gap between herself and beasts. The two races have struggled to coexist, leading to racial tensions and conflict on both sides. By the events of Path of Radiance, Tellius is divided into seven nations which remain at peace. A key item in Tellius is Lehran's Medallion, the world's incarnation of the recurring Fire Emblem. It is a bronze medallion said to contain a dark deity who brought chaos to the world 800 years before and caused all the world but Tellius to be engulfed by <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> <b>To</b> prevent the dark god being freed, war must be prevented in Tellius.|$|E

Nevertheless, he considered retiring from <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> go into business with his seafaring brother Oliver, who had also grown tired of the wandering life. They did not proceed with this project, but instead each invested his savings in a share of a ship: Oliver in Julia A. Hallock, and Benjamin in Mary Celeste. In October 1872, Benjamin took command of Mary Celeste for her first voyage following her extensive New York refit, which was {{to take her to}} Genoa in Italy. He arranged for his wife and infant daughter to accompany him, while his school-aged son was left at home with his grandmother.|$|E
