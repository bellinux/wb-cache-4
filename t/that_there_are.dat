5|$|Further {{calculations}} of this ilk combine {{to show that}} the number of essentially different Sudoku grids is 5,472,730,538, for example as demonstrated by Jarvis / Russell and verified by Pettersen. Similar methods have been applied to the 2x3 case, where Jarvis / Russell showed <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 49 essentially different grids (see also the article by Bailey, Cameron and Connelly), to the 2x4 case, where Russell showed <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 1,673,187 essentially different grids (verified by Pettersen), and to the 2x5 case where Pettersen showed <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 4,743,933,602,050,718 essentially different grids (not verified).|$|E

Viruses are the main agents responsible for the rapid destruction of harmful algal blooms, which often kill other marine life, and help maintain the ecological balance of different species of marine blue-green algae, and thus adequate oxygen production for life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} written references {{that have}} survived {{relating to the}} islands were made by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History, where he states <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 30 Hebudes, and makes a separate reference to Dumna, which Watson (1926) concludes is unequivocally the Outer Hebrides. Writing about 80 years later, in 140-150AD, Ptolemy, drawing on the earlier naval expeditions of Agricola, writes <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> five Ebudes (possibly meaning the Inner Hebrides) and Dumna. Later texts in classical Latin, by writers such as Solinus, use the forms Hebudes and Hæbudes.|$|E
