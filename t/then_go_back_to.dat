5|$|Another novel {{aspect of}} the {{offensive}} used by the attackers, which was extensively commented upon by American journalist Timothy Turner who was observing the battle from El Paso, was the rotation of troops that the rebels employed. Rather than attacking en masse with the whole army, Villa and Orozco had their soldiers engage the enemy for a few hours, <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> secure positions to sleep, while other rebels took their place. As a consequence the rebel troops were always rested while the less numerous defending federal troops were forced to remain sleepless and ever vigilant.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} {{property of}} the non-radiative transition between 3E and 1A {{is that it is}} stronger for ms = ±1 and weaker for ms = 0. This property results in a very useful manipulation of N-V center, which is called optical spin-polarization. First, an off-resonance excitation which has a higher frequency (typically 2.32 eV (532nbsp&nm)) than the frequencies of all transitions and thus lays in the vibronic bands for all transitions. By using a pulse of this wavelength, people can excite all spin states and create phonons as well. For a spin state with ms = 0, due to conservation of spin in transition, it will be excited to the corresponding ms = 0 state in 3E and <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> original state. However, for a spin state with ms = ±1 in 3A, after the excitation, it has a relatively high probability to jump to the intermediate state 1A by non-radiative transition and go to the ground state with ms = 0. After sufficient cycles, the state of the N-V center can be regarded as in the ms = 0 state. Such a process can be used in the initialization of quantum state in quantum information processing.|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} studio {{version of}} [...] "What Is Life" [...] – in fact, a rough {{mix of the}} original backing track with different orchestration (in this case, piccolo trumpet and oboe) – was issued as one of five bonus tracks on the 2001 remaster of All Things Must Pass. In the accompanying booklet, Harrison writes that this orchestral arrangement was discarded because he [...] "didn't like the feel". Speaking to Billboard editor-in-chief Timothy White in December 2000, Harrison explained {{the reason for the}} lack of a guide vocal on this version: [...] "I'm playing the fuzz guitar part that goes all through the song. So all I could do on the [...] take was to give the band the cue line – the first line of each verse – and <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> playing that riff. So that rough mix without the vocal – I'd forgot all about it …" [...] The track also appears on the 2014 Apple Years 1968–75 reissue of All Things Must Pass.|$|E
500|$|When Levi {{was first}} {{cast as the}} voice of Flynn, the {{character}} had been scripted as a British farmer at the time, requiring Levi to voice him with a British accent until Flynn was eventually developed into a bandit with an American accent. Although Flynn and Rapunzel share several scenes together during the film, Levi and singer Mandy Moore, his co-star who provides the voice of Rapunzel, recorded virtually none of their dialogue together due to scheduling conflicts, which Levi cited as one of the challenges he endured while working on the film, in addition to having to star in the television series Chuck simultaneously. Levi's starring role on Chuck required the actor to constantly [...] "shed a character and take on another character and shed that character and <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> something else". However, Levi and Moore did meet on one occasion to record their romantic duet [...] "I See the Light", Levi was not intimidated by the thought of recording the song, describing the experience as [...] "an added bonus". However, he admitted to having been nervous to sing with Moore, a professional singer, and working with composer Alan Menken. Although the actor identifies himself as [...] "no stranger to singing" [...] due to his background in musical theatre, Levi's performance of [...] "I See the Light" [...] is considered to be his [...] "big singing debut" [...] because it was his first time recording a song professionally.|$|E

500|$|After Rachel and Ross drunkenly {{get married}} while on {{vacation}} in Las Vegas during season five, Schwimmer had initially objected {{to the idea of}} having his character Ross divorce her– his third divorce– because he felt that it was taking it [...] "too far." [...] The actor explained that [...] "The whole arc of the relationship was weird then ... because for [...] {{to be able to move}} on enough to marry someone else and <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> being in love with Rachel later just went a bit too far." [...] Rachel and Joey's romantic storyline was conceived because the writers wanted to delay Ross and Rachel's reunion further. Crane felt that pairing Rachel and Joey during season ten [...] "was for the greater good" [...] because [...] "It was inappropriate." [...] However, the cast initially protested the idea, fearing that Rachel, Joey, and Ross would ultimately become unlikeable characters and audiences would either [...] "resent Joey for going after a pregnant woman, or resent Rachel for rejecting him, or resent Ross for standing between the two of them." [...] Meanwhile, the writers also approached the concept of Rachel's pregnancy and baby tentatively, worrying about how they would include it in the show because they did not want Friends [...] "to become a show about a baby" [...] while [...] "On the other hand, we don't want to pretend that there isn't one." [...] According to Robert Bianco of USA Today, the critical success and popularity of Rachel's pregnancy is ultimately responsible for [...] "propel the show to the top of the ratings". When it finally came time to write the series finale, [...] "The only thing [...] absolutely knew from very early on was that we had to get Ross and Rachel together," [...] deciding, [...] "We had dicked the audience around for 10 years with their 'will they or won’t they,' and we didn’t see any advantage in frustrating them" [...] any longer. However, at one point the writers had deliberated ending the series with Ross and Rachel in [...] "a gray area of where they aren’t together, but we hint there’s a sense that they might be down the road." [...] Ultimately, Crane and Kauffman relented in favor of giving the audience what they want.|$|E

2500|$|Since 2004 a US subsidy {{has been}} paid to {{companies}} that blend biofuel and regular fuel. [...] The European biofuel subsidy is paid at the point of sale. [...] Companies import biofuel to the US, blend 1% or even 0.1% regular fuel, and then ship the blended fuel to Europe, where it can get a second subsidy. [...] These blends are called B99 or B99.9 fuel. [...] The practice is called [...] "splash and dash". [...] The imported fuel may even come from Europe to the US, get 0.1% regular fuel, and <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Europe. For B99.9 fuel the US blender gets a subsidy of $0.999 per gallon. The European biodiesel producers have urged the EU to impose punitive duties on these subsidized imports.

It never crossed my mind that the {{occasion}} would ever arise, so when I got the phone call, it was really odd. There was never any doubt that I'd do it for Mike [...] and it's not something that's really been done — I don't think someone's ever died off-screen and then they've done the funeral on-screen. I think everyone was quite wary because it's quite an odd thing to do to have attended his real funeral and <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> film it all over again. There was some trepidation about how it was going to work. But as soon as we arrived, it was like 11 years of your life had been wiped out and you'd been there the day before [...] I had this really lovely scene with Sid [...] where I said: [...] "Isn't it strange, you imagine you’d come back and everything would be here waiting for us just like it was." [...] Diane's saying everything's moved on, but for me it was the opposite, I'd got back there and everything was the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|Achill Archaeological Field School {{is based}} at the Achill Archaeology Centre in Dooagh, which {{has served as a}} {{catalyst}} for a wide array of archaeological investigations on the island. It was founded in 1991 and is a training school for students of archaeology and anthropology. Since 1991, several thousand students from 21 countries have come to Achill to study and participate in ongoing excavations. The school is involved in a study of the prehistoric and historic landscape at Slievemore, incorporating a research excavation at a number of sites within the deserted village of Slievemore. Slievemore is rich in archaeological monuments that span a 5,000 year period from the Neolithic to the Post Medieval. Recent archaeological [...] research suggests the village was occupied year-round at least as early as the 19th century, though it is known to have served as a seasonally occupied booley village by {{the first half of the}} 20th century. A booley village (a number of which exist in a ruined state on the island) is a village occupied only during part of the year, such as a resort community, a lake community, or (as the case on Achill) a place to live while tending flocks or herds of ruminants during winter or summer pasturing. Specifically, some of the people of Dooagh and Pollagh would migrate in the summer to Slievemore and <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Dooagh in the autumn. The summer 2009 field school excavated Round House 2 on Slievemore Mountain under the direction of archaeologist Stuart Rathbone. [...] Only the outside north wall, entrance way and inside of the Round House were completely excavated.|$|E
