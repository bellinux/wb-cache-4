It was written by Krista Vernoff and directed by Ed Ornelas. The episode was originally broadcast on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States on September 24, 2009. In [...] "Good Mourning", the physicians are seen dealing with the revelation that a dead John Doe is their beloved co-worker Dr. George O'Malley (T.R. Knight), {{and dealing with the}} aftermath of Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl)'s near-death experience. Further storylines include Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) and Stevens <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> or not to donate O'Malley's organs and Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) being offered Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.)'s chief of surgery job.|$|E

Extra security precautions were taken to prevent the finale's secrets from becoming exposed. Network staff members were forced to sign non-disclosure agreements, and decoy scripts were drafted and disseminated to protect the twist ending. In one of the fake alternate endings, Dexter learned on the news about a child murderer escaping from prison, and the episode would end with Dexter <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> to join Rita on vacation or go after the escaped killer. Nobody but essential cast and staff were allowed on the set during filming of the episode, and the scripts and DVDs of the episode were watermarked before they were taken off the set.|$|E

She did not get the part but Jemison's dancing skills did get her into the line up as a background dancer. [...] "I had a problem with the singing but I danced and acted pretty well enough for them to choose me. I think that people sometimes limit themselves and so rob themselves of the opportunity to realise their dreams. For me, I love the sciences and I also love the arts," [...] says Jemison.

The following part of the thesis contains interpretations of some of the poems - these focus on the analysis of language deformations and the imagination of the collection. The hesitation between mimesis and maniera, i. e. between an independent aesthetic structure and a new enunciation of the world, is finally revealed as one of the constitutive traits of the collection...|$|R
30|$|N- 1 RSs {{transmit}} a known {{signal and}} collect data generated {{according to the}} echo. They make local decisions (their independent decisions) according to these data and then transmit these decisions to a fusion center through several relay nodes over fading and noisy channels. The relay nodes are selected following a certain routing protocol. Each relay node sends the decision from its source node to the next node until it reaches the fusion center. The fusion center <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> or not <b>to</b> have a target in the monitoring area based on the received information. For the significantly improving of detection performance, the fusion center uses likelihood ratio to fuse each sensor’s local decision. In this section, we will describe two fusion rules based on different relay rules.|$|R

The focus is a classroom episode in which the children <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> two lines that they know continue (but cannot {{see all of the}} continuation) will intersect, or not. The analysis illustrates how the children can move from an empirical, visual description of spatial relations to a more theoretical, abstract one.

30|$|Several {{types of}} {{anti-phishing}} solutions {{have been developed}} for web-based phishing solutions. The traditional URL-based anti-phishing solutions [2 – 5] <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> a page is a phishing page based on its URL. They are limited by the timeliness of malicious URL database update. The solutions based on page contents [6, 7] rely on the context or image processing techniques to detect phishing attacks, which can cause high performance overhead. As the phishing pages usually maintain similar page layouts to their target websites, the similarity of page layouts has been demonstrated as an important metric to detect phishing pages [8, 9]. In particular, features extracted from CSS layout files are used to measure page similarity. However, these measurements heavily rely on human experiences and thus may not be comprehensive to detect new attacks. How to comprehensively evaluate the pages’ similarity remains a great challenge.|$|R

5000|$|An online {{identity}} that has acquired an excellent reputation is valuable for two reasons: first, {{one or more}} persons invested {{a great deal of}} time and effort to build the identity's reputation; and second, other users look to the identity's reputation as they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> it is sufficiently trustworthy.

Sony objected, asserting that the character is Sony's intellectual property, and demanded the removal of the auction; under the terms of the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), eBay could have become a party to a copyright infringement lawsuit if it failed to comply.
