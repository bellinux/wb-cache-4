Many methods of spindle <b>temperature</b> <b>field</b> measurement have been proposed. However, most of the methods are based on the electric temperature sensors. There exist some defects (e. g., anti-interference, multiplexing, and stability capacity are poor).

40|$|The {{explicit}} finite difference (EFD) {{method is}} used to calculate the casting <b>temperature</b> <b>field</b> during the solidification process. Because of its limited time step, the computational efficiency of the EFD method is lower than that of the alternating direction implicit (ADI) method.

50|$|Infrared (IR) {{thermography}} is {{an analysis}} technique {{based on the}} detection of radiation in the IR wavelength spectrum. According to the black body radiation law, all objects with temperature greater than absolute zero emit IR radiation. The device detecting and composing a 2D image of the IR radiation is generally called an IR camera or a thermographic camera, {{also referred to as}} an infrared camera. The result of the thermographic recording is an image or a sequence, which corresponds to the intensity of the thermal radiation of the recorded object. The recording is called a thermogram. The intensity of the thermal radiation of the object is directly connected with the object temperature. The thermogram is therefore an image of the object surface temperature distribution. IR thermography is in the most cases used for non-contact measurement of spatial and time distribution of <b>temperature</b> <b>fields.</b>|$|E
50|$|The flamelet concept {{considers}} the turbulent flame as an aggregate of thin, laminar(Re<2000), locally one-dimensional flamelet structures present within the turbulent flow field. Counterflow diffusion flame {{is a common}} laminar flame {{which is used to}} represent a flamelet in a turbulent flow. Its geometry consists of opposed and axi-symmetric fuel and oxidizer jets. As the distance between the jets is decreased and/or the velocity of the jets is increased, the flame is strained and departs from its chemical equilibrium until it eventually extinguishes. The mass fraction of species and <b>temperature</b> <b>fields</b> can be measured or calculated in laminar counterflow diffusion flame experiments. When calculated, a self-similar solution exists, and the governing equations can be simplified to only one dimension i.e. along the axis of the fuel and oxidizer jets. It is in this direction where complex chemistry calculations can be performed afford-ably.|$|E

40|$|There is {{method of}} control of <b>temperature</b> <b>field</b> of {{thermocouple}} based sensor with controlled profile of <b>temperature</b> <b>field</b> (TBS with CPTF) along electrodes of main thermocouple (MTC) considered in this paper. This mentioned above method is based on neural networks. MTC measure temperature of an object directly. Stable profile of the <b>temperature</b> <b>field</b> along electrodes of MTC doesn?t allow to the heterogeneity error of thermoelectrodes of MTC appear itself. Such stability of the <b>temperature</b> <b>field</b> is achieved due to control subsystems that create and support their own <b>temperature</b> <b>field</b> for MTC. Thus, change of <b>temperature</b> <b>field</b> of an object of measurement doesn?t lead to change of the <b>temperature</b> <b>field</b> along electrodes of MTC. And, as it was mentioned above, heterogeneity error of thermoelectrodes of MTC don?t affect on total error of a measurement. There are 2 main properties of the method. The first property is to measure temperature deviation from given temperature for each zone. After that, create ordered sets of those deviations and corresponding temperatures of zones. Then it?s necessary to input those sets to neural network. Second property is to create training vectors for neural network. Those vectors are created by measurement of temperature deviations after random change of control action. Training of a neural network without precise mathematical model of an object is possible by this way. ? ?????? ????????? ???????????? ????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ?????????????? ???? ????? ???????? ?????????
