5|$|The predators of the <b>tilefish</b> {{are poorly}} understood. Juveniles can be preyed upon by dogfish or conger eels, which are prey for adult <b>tilefish.</b> Sharks have been presumed be predators of the <b>tilefish,</b> but no {{evidence}} is seen of free-swimming <b>tilefish</b> {{being attacked by}} dusky sharks or sandbar sharks. The one listed predator for the <b>tilefish</b> is the goosefish. The function of the tilefish's burrows was predator avoidance, but this has been disputed because chased <b>tilefish</b> try to outswim their predators rather than entering their burrows to seek shelter.|$|E
5|$|A small {{percentage}} of golden <b>tilefish</b> {{is known to be}} intersexual, having opposite nonfunctional sex tissues. Male <b>tilefish</b> specimens also inhibited a cavity that came from ovarian tissue and sperm sinuses. <b>Tilefish</b> of both genders in the Gulf of Mexico exhibited a higher rate of intersex characteristics than other populations.|$|E
5|$|The diet of <b>tilefish</b> larvae is unknown, {{but it is}} {{believed}} to be zooplankton. Juvenile and adults are omnivorous with a preference for small benthic invertebrates, with a staple being crabs and lobster. Great northern <b>tilefish</b> also consume bivalve molluscs, salps, squid, Atlantic dogfish, mackrel, hagfish, and herring. Human trash is also eaten, including potato peels and meat bones. They also eat other <b>tilefish</b> in a display of cannibalistism.|$|E

5|$|The great {{northern}} <b>tilefish</b> has {{a unique}} burrowing behavior and habitat preference. In addition to their unique habitat choice, golden <b>tilefish</b> display sexually dimorphic growth with males growing to larger sizes and are behaviorally dominant over their female counterparts. The great northern <b>tilefish</b> is not a migratory fish; it stays in one local area that fits its needs all year round. Seasonal migration may occur with changes in the water temperatures around the Nantucket Shoals and Georges Bank during the winter or spring, but this theory has no definitive evidence. A competing theory suggests that <b>tilefish</b> may instead reduce their activity or hibernate within their burrows during times of cold temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Decline in age, size during sexual {{maturity}} in great northern <b>tilefish</b> population is occurring throughout the continental shelf. In the mid-Atlantic Bight, smaller sizes and younger ages at maturity {{were observed in}} 2008, compared to the survey data from the 1980s where recorded measurements showed a larger population. The recent estimates of age and size at maturity in the southern U.S. waters were smaller than those previously reported in the late 1980s. There were also very few juvenile <b>tilefish</b> seen in <b>tilefish</b> population surveys in the southern U.S. waters in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Declines in population could negatively affect other organisms in their surrounding environment {{due to the fact}} that without <b>tilefish,</b> the burrows underneath the continental shelf will disappear, therefore putting an end to the symbiotic relationship with other organisms that use the tunnels as shelter.|$|E
5|$|The great {{northern}} <b>tilefish</b> {{has been}} subject to regulation to prevent overfishing. Regulations include catch limits and gear restrictions to prevent damage to the species' habitat and population. The result of these regulations has been a rebounding of the population, which led {{to an increase in}} the 2012 catch limit {{in the southern part of}} the Atlantic seaboard.|$|E

5|$|Shark fin soup is {{a status}} symbol in Asian countries, and is {{considered}} healthy and full of nutrients. Sharks are also killed for meat. European diners consume dogfishes, smoothhounds, catsharks, makos, porbeagle and also skates and rays. However, the U.S. FDA lists sharks as one of four fish (with swordfish, king mackerel, and <b>tilefish)</b> whose high mercury content is hazardous to children and pregnant women.|$|E
5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and <b>tilefish</b> contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E
25|$|Fish Hawks {{capabilities}} {{launched a}} new era in both fisheries research and fish culture. Her first assignment was to investigate a previously unknown fish, the <b>tilefish,</b> which a commercial fisherman had brought to the Fish Commission station in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 1879. During 1880, operating out of Newport, Rhode Island, she made four voyages to dredge the edge of the continental shelf, during which she gathered data establishing the range and quantity of the <b>tilefish,</b> which later would become an important fishery. Such were her scientific capabilities that she also discovered 40 new species of mollusk and 20 new species of fishes during the four voyages. With the four voyages completed, she returned to Wilmington to have her hatching cones installed so that she could begin her first hatchery work with shad eggs off the southeast coast of the United States by about March 1881.|$|E
2500|$|Several species {{build up}} mounds of coral pieces either {{to protect the}} {{entrance}} to their burrows, as in <b>tilefishes</b> and gobies of the genus Valenciennea, or to protect the patch of sand in which they will bury themselves for the night, as in the Jordan's tuskfish Choerodon jordani [...] and the rockmover wrasse Novaculichthys taeniourus.|$|R
2500|$|The city's fishery economy {{improved}} {{beginning with}} a fishery opened by Captain Dick Myers in 1920, whom the next year purchased [...] between West 7th Street and the bay. In 1927, several Scandinavian fisherman united to form the Independent Fishery. During this period, gillnetting declined in popularity, but it would later gain a comeback in the 1950s. Also in the 1950s, dragger fishing was ended and <b>tilefishing</b> began.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to the overfishing, the <b>tilefish's</b> age of sexual maturity has been dramatically affected. From 1978 to 1982, {{the median age of}} sexual maturity in males declined by 2.5 years from 7.1 to 4.6 years. This resulted in the males becoming sexually mature before females. In 2008, the median age of sexual maturity in males had risen to 5.9 years. Females of the species also exhibit low reproductive ability after becoming sexually mature, instead increasing with age and their sexual maturity has varied to a lesser extent then the male population across the years.|$|R
25|$|Another {{study found}} that {{pregnant}} women who consumed 340grams of low-mercury containing fish with fatty acids per week have benefits that outweigh the risks for mercury poisoning. They {{were less likely to}} have children with low verbal IQ, motor coordination and behavioral problems. However, foods containing high amounts of mercury, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel and <b>tilefish,</b> might cause mental retardation.|$|E
25|$|Some animals {{move through}} solids such as soil by {{burrowing}} using peristalsis, as in earthworms, or other methods. In loose solids such as sand some animals, {{such as the}} golden mole, marsupial mole, and the pink fairy armadillo, are able to move more rapidly, 'swimming' through the loose substrate. Burrowing animals include moles, ground squirrels, naked mole-rats, <b>tilefish,</b> and mole crickets.|$|E
25|$|The Scandinavian {{fisherman}} {{founded the}} Independent Dock, {{which is now}} known as Viking Village and, today, provides a combined shopping and industrial establishment with both handcrafted goods and fresh seafood. Catches typically consist of scallops, tuna, swordfish, <b>tilefish,</b> weakfish, monkfish, bluefish, shad, dogfish, and various other types of in-shore fish. In the 1960s and 1970s, foreign trawlers were permitted to fish in the area. Nearly all of the cod to have been fished out of the area. The scallop boat Lindsay L, docked at Viking Village, was used in the movie The Perfect Storm.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} mating systems among teleosts. Some species are promiscuous, where {{both males and}} females breed with multiple partners and there are no obvious mate choices. This has been recorded in Baltic herring, guppies, Nassau groupers, humbug damselfish, cichlids and creole wrasses. Polygamy, where one sex has multiple partners can come in many forms. Polyandry consists of one adult female breeding with multiple males, which only breed with that female. This is rare among teleosts, and fish in general, but is found in the clownfish. In addition, it may also exist to an extent among anglerfish, where some females have more than one male attached to them. Polygyny, where one male breeds with multiple females, is much more common. This is recorded in sculpins, sunfish, darters, damselfish and cichlids where multiple females may visit a territorial male that guards and takes care of eggs and young. Polygyny may also involve a male guarding a harem of several females. This occurs in coral reef species, such as damselfishes, wrasses, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and <b>tilefishes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Striped bass has {{firm and}} flavorful flesh {{with a large}} flake. The hybrid striped bass yields more meat, has a more fragile texture, and a blander flavor than wild striped bass. The fish has a mild and {{distinctive}} flavor. In recipes, it can be substituted for milder fish like cod, {{as well as for}} stronger fish like bluefish. Other fish can substitute it, including weakfish, <b>tilefish,</b> blackfish, small bluefish, catfish, salmon, swordfish, and shark. Striped bass is easily grilled in fillets, and is therefore popular in beach communities.|$|E
25|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, albacore tuna, and <b>tilefish</b> contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. This is because mercury is stored in the muscle tissues of fish, and when a predatory fish eats another fish, it assumes the entire body burden of mercury in the consumed fish. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. The first occurrence of widespread mercury poisoning in humans occurred this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E
500|$|The tilefish's {{construction}} {{and expansion of}} burrows {{are the subject of}} ongoing research to better understand the behavior of the species. Whether the <b>tilefish</b> begins the construction a burrow or if it expands an existing one is unknown. The burrow is presumed to be lengthened and widened by the <b>tilefish</b> as it continues to grow and age. [...] <b>Tilefish</b> typically are found in their own burrows, with sharing exhibited with male and female pairs. <b>Tilefish</b> tend to congregate in their habitat, with their burrows in relative proximity to each other; the species does not form schools. The grouping of <b>tilefish</b> can be as dense as 13,000 burrows per km2 off the southern U.S. Atlantic coast, but 1,600 burrows per per km2 were reported in inhabited areas of the Gulf of Mexico and 2,500 burrows per per km2 [...] near the Hudson Canyon. <b>Tilefish</b> burrows also provide a home for various species that live in the area, such as mollusks and other crustaceans.|$|E
500|$|The great {{northern}} <b>tilefish</b> (Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps), or golden tile, is {{the largest}} species in the family Malacanthidae (tilefishes), which grows to an average length between [...] [...] The great northern <b>tilefish</b> is a slow-growing and long-lived species, which has four stages of life. After hatching from eggs, the larvae are found in plankton. As they grow into juveniles, the individuals seek shelter until finding or making their own burrows. As adults, the <b>tilefish</b> continue to expand their burrows in the sediment throughout their lives. The diet of the larvae is unknown, but presumed to consist of zooplankton; juveniles and adults feed upon various benthic invertebrates, crustaceans, and fish. After reaching sexual maturity between 5 and 7 years of age, females lay eggs throughout the mating season for the male to fertilize, with each female laying an average of 2.3 million eggs.|$|E
500|$|The great {{northern}} <b>tilefish</b> {{is known}} to dig and occupy burrows along the outer continental shelf, and on the flanks of submarine canyons in malleable clay substrate. Due to their long life expectancy, slow growth, complex breeding system, and habitat specificity, they are vulnerable to overexploitation, and they are susceptible to mass mortality events due to cold-water intrusion and overfishing. Their abundance is strongly correlated with presence of silt-clay substrate, because the soft clay enables the fish to create the burrow itself by simply digging away the clay substrate. The minimum temperature threshold for golden <b>tilefish</b> is [...] Temperature observations and measurements are obtained by interpolated observations. Temperature plots indicate that 9°C is the norm for the area around Florida and the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

The larvae are found in plankton from July to September in the Middle Atlantic Bight. The transitional phase between larvae and juveniles is unknown, but juveniles either find or excavate a burrow or place of shelter to inhabit. After they grow in size and become sexually active, the adults spawn throughout the mating season to propagate the species.|$|E
500|$|The {{species was}} first {{discovered}} in 1879, when a cod trawler caught some by chance while working {{off of the}} coast of Massachusetts. The species was named Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps by George Brown Goode and Tarleton Hoffman Bean in 1896 in their seminal work Oceanic Ichthyology, A Treatise on the Deep-Sea and Pelagic Fishes of the World, from a sample collected [...] southeast of Nomans Land, Massachusetts. Its genus is Lopholatilus, which [...] is in the family Malacanthidae, commonly known as <b>tilefish.</b> The Malacanthidae {{are part of the}} Percoidea, a suborder of the order Perciformes. L. chamaeleonticeps gained its moniker [...] "great northern tilefish" [...] from its prodigious size and its discovery at relatively high latitudes for a member of the Malacanthidae. When used in cooking, the species is generally referred to as the [...] "golden tile", for the large yellow spots across its blue-green back and lighter-yellow or pink sides. The species is distinguished from other members of its large family by a prominent crest on its head.|$|E
2500|$|Methylmercury is {{the major}} source of organic mercury for all individuals. Due to {{bioaccumulation}} it works its way up through the food web and thus biomagnifies, resulting in high concentrations among populations of some species. Top predatory fish, such as tuna or swordfish, are usually of greater concern than smaller species. The US FDA and the EPA advise women of child-bearing age, nursing mothers, and young children to completely avoid swordfish, shark, king mackerel and <b>tilefish</b> from the Gulf of Mexico, and to limit consumption of albacore ("white") tuna to no more than [...] per week, and of all other fish and shellfish to no more than [...] per week. A 2006 review of the risks and benefits of fish consumption found, for adults, the benefits of one to two servings of fish per week outweigh the risks, even (except for a few fish species) for women of childbearing age, and that avoidance of fish consumption could result in significant excess coronary heart disease deaths and suboptimal neural development in children.|$|E
