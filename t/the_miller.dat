5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Miller</b> House is a Mid-Century modern home {{designed}} by Eero Saarinen and located in Columbus, Indiana. The residence {{was commissioned by}} American industrialist, philanthropist, and architecture patron J. Irwin Miller and his wife Xenia Simons Miller in 1953. Design and construction on <b>the</b> <b>Miller</b> House took four years and was completed in 1957. The home was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2000. In 2009, the home and gardens, along {{with many of the}} original furnishings, were donated to the Indianapolis Museum of Art by <b>the</b> <b>Miller</b> family. In addition to Eero Saarinen, the house and gardens showcases the work of leading 20th-century figures such as interior designer Alexander Girard, landscape architect Dan Kiley, and principal design associate at the Saarinen office, Kevin Roche.|$|E

5|$|In 1664 {{the mill}} {{partially}} burned down. It was rebuilt and, {{in order to}} recover from the losses, <b>the</b> <b>miller</b> did not have to pay taxes for the next 15 years. In 1764 another fire destroyed the entire mill, according to an ordenance from the States General after <b>the</b> <b>miller</b> requested assistance. The mill was rebuilt {{with the addition of a}} second water wheel. The larger building was a gristmill and the smaller building an oil mill. In 1909 a sawmill was added to the larger building, and for a period the smaller building also acted as a fulling mill.|$|E

5|$|Rand and Robyn Miller both {{wanted to}} develop Mysts back story into novels. After {{the success of}} Myst, {{publisher}} Hyperion signed a three-book, US$1 million deal with the brothers. David Wingrove worked from <b>the</b> <b>Miller</b> brothers' story outlines. The three books, entitled Myst: The Book of Atrus, Myst: The Book of Ti'ana, and Myst: The Book of D'ni, were released in 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively. The books were later packaged together as The Myst Reader. A fourth novel, entitled Myst: The Book of Marrim, is planned.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Miller</b> {{brothers}} {{wrote the}} entire first novel, but were unsatisfied with the result; the Millers {{pointed out that}} writing a character for a novel is much harder than writing the characters of a game. Hyperion recruited author David Wingrove {{to assist with the}} project; the Millers ended up giving Wingrove a detailed draft, and the author rewrote the entire book. The book's design was made to fit the themes of the game; the novels are made to look like journals found in Myst, with embossed covers and pages darkened as though with time and use.|$|E

5|$|Another of {{the early}} subwoofers was {{developed}} during the late 1960s by Ken Kreisel, {{the former president of}} <b>the</b> <b>Miller</b> & Kreisel Sound Corporation in Los Angeles. When Kreisel's business partner, Jonas Miller, who owned a high-end audio store in Los Angeles, told Kreisel that some purchasers of the store's high-end electrostatic speakers had complained about a lack of bass response in the electrostatics, Kreisel designed a powered woofer that would reproduce only those frequencies that were too low for the electrostatic speakers to convey. Infinity's full range electrostatic speaker system that was developed during the 1960s also used a woofer to cover the lower frequency range that its electrostatic arrays did not handle adequately.|$|E
5|$|Between Bow Bridge and Channelsea Bridge {{there were}} three others, said in 1303 to have been built to fill the gaps caused by the cutting of mill streams through Maud's causeway, {{although}} {{there is evidence that}} the mills pre-dated the causeway. However, the mill owners took responsibility for the bridges, which crossed the mill streams for St Thomas's, Spileman's and Saynes mills. The last two were owned by the City of London, and the bridges were called Pegshole and St Michael's Bridges. An administrative mistake around 1814 resulted in the City of London taking responsibility for St Thomas's Bridge, but <b>the</b> <b>miller</b> did not complain as Pegshole bridge was smaller and therefore less costly to maintain. The names were eventually swapped, and all three were replaced by Groves Bridge in 1933, which crossed the widened Three Mills Wall River, the two branches of the Waterworks River having been combined into Three Mills Wall River, while Three Mills Wall Back River was filled in.|$|E
5|$|Data {{processing}} {{begins with}} indexing the reflections. This means identifying {{the dimensions of}} the unit cell and which image peak corresponds to which position in reciprocal space. A byproduct of indexing is to determine the symmetry of the crystal, i.e., its space group. Some space groups can be eliminated from the beginning. For example, reflection symmetries cannot be observed in chiral molecules; thus, only 65 space groups of 230 possible are allowed for protein molecules which are almost always chiral. Indexing is generally accomplished using an autoindexing routine. Having assigned symmetry, the data is then integrated. This converts the hundreds of images containing the thousands of reflections into a single file, consisting of (at the very least) records of <b>the</b> <b>Miller</b> index of each reflection, and an intensity for each reflection (at this state the file often also includes error estimates and measures of partiality (what part of a given reflection was recorded on that image)).|$|E
50|$|Nicollet Park {{went out}} with a bang, as <b>the</b> <b>Millers</b> won <b>the</b> American Association {{championship}} tournament, {{and then went on}} to vie for the Junior World Series championship, facing the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. The series went the distance of 7 games, and the finale was a close-fought win for <b>the</b> <b>Millers</b> in what was also the final game at Nicollet Park. In 1956 <b>the</b> <b>Millers</b> moved to Metropolitan Stadium in the suburb of Bloomington.|$|R

5|$|For years, Rosecroft Raceway held {{an annual}} sale of {{yearling}} Standardbred horses. It hosted the annual Maryland Sire Stake Races {{to promote the}} best of Maryland-bred horses. When Rosecroft opened, it became {{the political and social}} center for Prince George's County, Maryland. Each year during <b>the</b> <b>Miller</b> era, several thousand people traveled from across the country to wager on and watch the horses. In 1953, Rosecroft's attendance of 192,585 was the highest among all harness tracks in Maryland. Owners, trainers, and drivers from across the United States moved their farms to Maryland in the 1950s following the opening of Rosecroft, hoping to compete with the best horses.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main Myst saga, Cyan developed , which was released on November 14, 2003. Uru allows players to customize their avatars, and renders graphics in real-time. The multiplayer component of Uru was initially cancelled, but GameTap eventually revived it as , which was in turn cancelled. The game was later resurrected as an open source title. The newest and current iteration of online Uru was made open source and various fan ages have been created. <b>The</b> <b>Miller</b> brothers collaborated with David Wingrove and wrote several novels based on the Myst universe, which were published by Hyperion. The novels, entitled Myst: The Book of Atrus, Myst: The Book of Ti'ana, and Myst: The Book of D'ni, fill in the games' backstory and were packaged together as The Myst Reader.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} the IMA has begun to focus on {{developing}} its contemporary art collection, which includes works such as Two White Dots in the Air by Alexander Calder and Light and Space III, a permanent installation by Robert Irwin located in the Pulliam Great Hall.

The Efroymson Pavilion has featured works by artists such as William Lamson, Ball-Nogues Studio, Orly Genger, and Heather Rowe to name a few. Contemporary art is also featured in 100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park, which is unique in its inclusion of commissioned works by emerging mid-career artists. Since 2007, the IMA has committed to building a modern design collection that illustrates the artistic merits of utilitarian objects.
