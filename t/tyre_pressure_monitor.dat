This includes examining the latest pressure sensing methods and comparing different types of pressure transducers, particularly their power consumption and measuring range. Having the aim of this research to investigate possible means to obtain a tyre condition monitoring system (TCMS) powered by energy harvesting, various approaches of energy harvesting techniques were evaluated to determine which approach is the most applicable for generating energy within the pneumatic tyre domain and under rolling tyre dynamic conditions. This article starts with an historical review of pneumatic tyre development and demonstrates the reasons and explains the need for using a tyre condition monitoring system. Following this, different <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement approaches are compared in order to determine what type of pressure sensor is best to consider in the research proposal plan.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose {{standardization}} of the firmware of in-car sensors to achieve software homogeneity across vendors. Such standardization enhances {{the reliability of the}} code by adhering to pre-set practices and definitions. It also increases the throughput of the programmers and opens up hardware platforms to third party developers. We make our case by advocating the use of TinyOS. TinyOS applications, coded in nesC introduce event-driven execution and component-centric design. Furthermore, programming in nesC reduces code size and potential bugs. We use the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>monitoring</b> system of a car as a case study to illustrate our model. In our implementation, TinySec is employed to address the security and privacy problems that plague current systems. Throughout the paper we show that the use of a common software stack automatically leads to hardware standardization and security improvement...|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} energy {{harvesting}} from a rotating automotive tyre is suggested {{in which the}} principle of stochastic resonance is advantageously exploited. A bistable response characteristic is obtained by recourse a small harvester comprising a magnetically repellant configuration in which an instrumented cantilever beam can flip between two physical response states when suitably excited by the rotation of a car wheel into which it is fitted. The rotation of the wheel creates a periodic modulation which enables stochastic resonance to take place {{and as a consequence}} of this for energy to be harvested from road noise transmitted through the tyre. An optimised mathematical model of the system is presented based on a series of experimental tests and it is shown that a ten-fold increase in harvested energy over a comparable monostable case is feasible. The suggested application for this harvester is to provide electrical power for a <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>monitoring</b> system...|$|R
