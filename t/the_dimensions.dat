5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{valuable}} use of an accurate orbit for a binary star system is to directly calculate the masses of the stars. This requires <b>the</b> <b>dimensions</b> and inclination of the orbit to be accurately known. <b>The</b> <b>dimensions</b> of Eta Carinae's orbit are only known approximately as the stars cannot be directly and separately observed. The inclination has been modelled at 130–145 degrees, but the orbit is still not known accurately enough to provide the masses of the two components.|$|E

5|$|Another way {{to measure}} {{the speed of light}} is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If <b>the</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. <b>The</b> <b>dimensions</b> were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.|$|E

5|$|Logarithms {{have many}} {{applications}} {{inside and outside}} mathematics. Some of these occurrences {{are related to the}} notion of scale invariance.

Benford's law on the distribution of leading digits can also be explained by scale invariance. Logarithms are also linked to self-similarity. For example, logarithms appear in the analysis of algorithms that solve a problem by dividing it into two similar smaller problems and patching their solutions. <b>The</b> <b>dimensions</b> of self-similar geometric shapes, that is, shapes whose parts resemble the overall picture are also based on logarithms.|$|E
