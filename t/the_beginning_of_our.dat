2500|$|When Orthodox Christians {{refer to}} Fallen Nature {{they are not}} saying that human nature has become evil in itself. Human nature is still formed {{in the image of}} God; we are still God's creation, and God has never created {{anything}} evil. But our fallen nature remains open to evil intents and actions. It is sometimes said that we are [...] "inclined to sin"; that is, we find some sinful things attractive. It is the nature of temptation to make sinful things seem the more attractive, and it is the fallen nature of humans that seeks or succumbs to the attraction. Orthodox Christians reject the Augustinian position that the descendants of Adam and Eve are actually guilty of the original sin of their ancestors. But just as any species begets its own kind, so fallen humans beget fallen humans, and from <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> existence we lie open to sinning by our own choice.|$|E
2500|$|Ivan Turgenev {{gradually}} re-considered {{his initial}} skepticism {{as to the}} novel’s historical aspect and also the style of Tolstoy's psychological analysis. In his 1880 article written {{in the form of}} a letter addressed to Edmond Abou, the editor of the French newspaper , Turgenev described Tolstoy as [...] "the most popular Russian writer" [...] and War and Peace as [...] "one of the most remarkable books of our age". [...] "This vast work has the spirit of an epic, where the life of Russia of <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> century in general and in details has been recreated by the hand of a true master ... The manner in which Count Tolstoy conducts his treatise is innovative and original. This is the great work of a great writer, and in it there’s true, real Russia", Turgenev wrote. It was largely due to Turgenev's efforts that the novel started to gain popularity with the European readership. The first French edition of the War and Peace (1879) paved the way for the worldwide success of Leo Tolstoy and his works.|$|E
