40|$|The {{search for}} {{efficiency}} in the cooperative credit sector has led cooperatives to adopt {{new technology and}} managerial knowhow. Among the tools that facilitate efficiency, data mining has stood out {{in recent years as}} a sophisticated methodology to search for knowledge that is “hidden” in organizations' databases. The process of granting credit is one of the central functions of a credit union; therefore, the use of instruments that support that process is desirable and may become a key factor in credit management. The steps undertaken by the present case study to perform the knowledge discovery process were data selection, data pre-processing and cleanup, data transformation, data mining, and the interpretation and evaluation of results. The results were evaluated through cross-validation of ten sets, repeated in ten simulations. The goal {{of this study is to}} develop models to analyze the capacity of a credit union's members <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> their <b>commitments,</b> using a decision tree—C 4. 5 algorithm and an artificial neural network—multilayer perceptron algorithm. It is concluded that for the problem at hand, the models have statistically similar results and may aid in a cooperative's decision-making process...|$|R

A control method that consists of {{the balance of the}} gaits, through the correction of the lateral and longitudinal angles of the pendulum is proposed in this work. This method presents three phases: first the trajectory of the foot in movement is defined, applying the inverse kinematics to calculate the robot's internal angles, and the direct kinematics is used to obtain the positions and orientations of the robot's joints; then the linear and angular accelerations are obtained; last, the zero moment point (ZMP) is calculated as a verification parameter of the requested margin of stability. Simulation of the robot gaits to walk in horizontal, sloping plans, and up and down stairs is also made. In order to decrease the calculation time of the dynamic stability, the impact of using zero pendulum angles as starting points for the interactive process of achieving the desired stability is compared {{to the use of the}} starting angles given by the static model. We also made a study to evaluate the necessary number of notable points to represent the gait to walk in horizontal plans. That evaluation demands <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> down a <b>commitment</b> between the stability quality and the computer effort, being therefore necessary to find a number of notable points that allows to reach that commitment, representing the gait satisfactorily...|$|R
