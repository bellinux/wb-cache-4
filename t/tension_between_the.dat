5|$|The citadel was {{not used}} during the rule of Gia Long and the only {{military}} action occurred after his son had ascended the throne as Minh Mạng. Years of <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> monarch and General Lê Văn Duyệt, the governor of southern Vietnam, {{came to a head}} after the death of the latter in 1831. <b>Tension</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> pair surfaced when Gia Long made Minh Mang the heir to the throne. Duyet had opposed the succession, favouring the enthronement of a young son of the late Prince Cảnh, the eldest of Gia Long's sons.|$|E

5|$|After {{several months}} of {{increasing}} <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> factions struggling for power within the insurgency, {{the first of the}} pro-Chetnik coups occurred, in the Ozren Partisan Detachment. It was sparked by the arrest and execution on 18 April of pro-Chetnik agitator Bogdan Jovićić by Vukmanović-Tempo and the newly formed 1st East Bosnian Shock Battalion. Fighting ensued between pro-Chetnik members of the detachment and the Shock Battalion. Vukmanović-Tempo then abandoned the Ozren Partisan Detachment, taking the detachment staff and remaining loyal Partisans with him.|$|E
5|$|For a time, Duyệt's {{attitude}} and stature {{in the south}} forced Minh Mạng to moderate his policies and allow the preaching of Christian missionaries. However, it also increased the <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> pair and Minh Mạng was anxious to curtail the autonomy {{that his father had}} granted to Duyệt and the southerners. The emperor began to slowly wind back their military powers, in an attempt to wear down Duyệt's power base by gradually removing the general's close aides.|$|E

5|$|Later in the day, 19 KLA {{fighters were}} wounded when the VJ shelled an arms {{smuggling}} route {{near the site}} of the ambush. They were evacuated by Albanian border guards and airlifted to receive treatment in the country's capital, Tirana. Albanian officials later alleged that two of the mortar rounds fired by Yugoslav troops had landed inside Albania, sparking further <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two countries. That afternoon, KLA militants attacked a Yugoslav border patrol, wounding another soldier.|$|E
5|$|To {{assist the}} actors in {{preparing}} for their roles, Scott wrote several pages of backstory for each character explaining their histories. He filmed many of their rehearsals in order to capture spontaneity and improvisation, and tensions between some of the cast members, particularly towards the less-experienced Weaver; this translated convincingly to film as <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> characters.|$|E

5|$|Anne had {{explained}} before {{that she did}} not wish the public to know that her relationship with Sarah was failing, because any sign that Sarah was out of favour would have a damaging impact on the Duke of Marlborough's authority as Captain-General. Sarah was kept in all of her offices – purely for the sake of her husband's position as Captain-General of the army – and the <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two women lingered on until early in 1711. This year was to see the end of their relationship for good.|$|E
5|$|Between 1830 and 1832 the Mexican Congress {{passed a}} series of laws that seemed to {{discriminate}} against Anglo colonists {{in the province of}} Coahuila y Tejas, increasing <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Anglo citizenry and Mexican officials. In response to the rumblings, Mexican troops established military posts in several locations within the province, including San Antonio de Béxar. Although much of the military supported the administration of President Anastasio Bustamante, Antonio López de Santa Anna led an insurrection against him in 1832. Anglo colonists in Texas supported Santa Anna and General José Antonio Mexía, who led soldiers into Texas to oust commanders loyal to Bustamante.|$|E
5|$|By February, Candice Michelle had {{announced}} {{that she was going}} to be on the cover of the April edition of Playboy magazine, and tension began to grow between Candice Michelle and Torrie Wilson. After winning a number one contender's Diva battle royal on Raw in which she first eliminated Wilson and then Mickie James and Ashley at the same time, Candice Michelle received her first singles WWE Women's Championship match, but she lost to champion Trish Stratus on February 27. After the match, Candice Michelle slapped Wilson, blaming her, in storyline, for the loss. As a result of the <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> women, Wilson became a fan favorite, while Candice Michelle and Victoria continued to act as villains on-screen.|$|E

5|$|Casino Royale {{deals with}} the {{question}} of Anglo-American relations, reflecting the real-world central role of the US in the defence of the West. The academic Jeremy Black points to the 1951 defections of two members of MI6—Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean—to the Soviet Union as having a major impact on how Britain was poorly viewed in US intelligence circles; Fleming was aware of this <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two countries, but he did not focus on it too strongly, and Bond and Leiter's warm relationship did not reflect the reality of the US-UK relationship.|$|E
5|$|In 1842 Secretary of State Daniel Webster {{negotiated}} with Britain the Webster–Ashburton Treaty, which determined {{the border between}} Maine and Canada. That issue had caused <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> United States and Britain for decades and had brought the two countries {{to the brink of}} war on several occasions. Though the treaty improved Anglo-American diplomatic relations,, Tyler was nevertheless unsuccessful in concluding a treaty with the British to fix the boundaries of Oregon. On Tyler's last full day in office, March 3, 1845, Florida was admitted to the Union as the 27th state.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania was {{incorporated}} into the Russian Empire in 1795. It was occupied by Germany during World War I, and declared itself independent on 16 February 1918. The next two years were marked by the turbulence of the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, delaying international recognition {{and the establishment of}} political institutions. The newly formed army fought the Bolsheviks, the Bermontians, and Poland. In October 1920, Poland annexed Vilnius, the historic and modern-day capital of Lithuania, and the surrounding area; this controversial action was the source of ongoing <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two powers during the interwar period. Lithuania's second-largest city, Kaunas, was designated the interim capital of the state.|$|E

5|$|Moondram Pirai {{depicts a}} young woman whose mental state regresses {{to that of a}} child {{following}} an accident. Sexuality and the repression of desire are dominant motifs, similar to Balu Mahendra's previous film Moodu Pani (1980). The film also explores the possibility of unresolved sexual <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> protagonists. Critic K. Jeshi compares Moondram Pirai to other films based on physical and mental disabilities like Sethu... (1999), Pithamagan (2003), Perazhagan (2004), Chandramukhi (2005), Anniyan (2005) and Ghajini (2005). When asked about the reason amnesia was chosen for a disability, Mahendra said the disorder is used as a camouflage and as an excuse to portray relationships in the film.|$|E
5|$|On Wednesday, October 26, 1881, the <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Earps and the Cowboys {{came to a}} head. Ike Clanton, Billy Claiborne, {{and other}} Cowboys had been {{threatening}} to kill the Earps for several weeks. Tombstone city Marshal Virgil Earp learned that the Cowboys were armed and had gathered near the O.K. Corral. He asked Wyatt and Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday to assist him, as he intended to disarm them. Wyatt was acting as a temporary assistant marshal, Morgan was a deputy city marshal, and Virgil deputized Holliday for the occasion. Around 3 pm, the Earps headed towards Fremont Street, where the Cowboys had been reported gathering.|$|E
5|$|Over the winter, {{there seems}} to have been some <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Allies. In particular, the Athenians, who were not {{protected}} by the isthmus, but whose fleet were the key to the security of the Peloponnesus, felt hard done by. They demanded an Allied army march north the following year. When the other Allies failed to commit to this, the Athenian fleet probably refused to join the Allied navy in the spring. The navy, now under the command of the Spartan king Leotychides, thus skulked off Delos, while the remnants of the Persian fleet skulked off Samos, both sides unwilling to risk battle. Similarly, Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the isthmus was pointless, while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus.|$|E
