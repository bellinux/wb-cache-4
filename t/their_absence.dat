5|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{required}} serpin, the protease that it normally would regulate is over-active, leading to pathologies. Consequently, simple deficiency of a serpin (e.g. a null mutation) can result in disease. Gene knockouts, particularly in mice, are used experimentally to determine the normal functions of serpins by the effect of <b>their</b> <b>absence.</b>|$|E
5|$|The violent {{removal of}} the Hébertists and Dantonists {{provided}} only a mirage of stability. Their deaths caused deep resentment in the Convention, and <b>their</b> <b>absence</b> only {{made it more difficult}} for the Jacobins to influence the dangerously unpredictable masses of sans-culottes. The elimination of the popular demagogues and the consequent loss of support in the streets would prove disastrous for Saint-Just and Robespierre during the events of Thermidor.|$|E

5|$|Alvarado rested {{two days}} at Tazuzcalco, before {{proceeding}} to Miahuaclan, {{which had been}} abandoned by its inhabitants, then on to Atehuan (modern Ateos, near the Pipil city of Cuscatlan, capital of {{the province of the}} same name). Messengers from the lords of Cuscatlan brought promises of submission to the King of Spain, but when Pedro de Alvarado's army arrived at the city, he found {{that the majority of the}} inhabitants had fled. Alvarado sent messengers to them, ordering them to return and submit, but they refused. Alvarado tried them in <b>their</b> <b>absence,</b> and condemned them to death; he branded all the Pipil prisoners as slaves.|$|E
5|$|At the May 2012 Digital Hollywood conference, Lindelof {{said that}} the videos {{originated}} from {{the question of the}} film's status as an Alien prequel. It was decided that creating videos with the film's stars would generate more interest than any commentary about its connection to the Alien films. He also {{said that the}} videos needed to be cool enough to justify their existence, but not so important that <b>their</b> <b>absence</b> from the final film would be an issue for audiences.|$|E
5|$|Comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) must {{be present}} to {{diagnose}} acne. In <b>their</b> <b>absence,</b> an appearance {{similar to that}} of acne would suggest a different skin disorder. Microcomedones (the precursor to blackheads and whiteheads) are not {{visible to the naked eye}} when inspecting the skin and can only be seen with a microscope. There are many features that may indicate a person's acne vulgaris is sensitive to hormonal influences. Historical and physical clues that may suggest hormone-sensitive acne include onset between ages 20 and 30; worsening the week before a woman's menstrual cycle; acne lesions predominantly over the jawline and chin; and inflammatory/nodular acne lesions.|$|E

5|$|Evaluating Mountfort's works today, one has {{to avoid}} judging them against a {{background}} of similar designs in Europe. In the 1860s, New Zealand was a developing country, where materials and resources freely available in Europe were conspicuous by <b>their</b> <b>absence.</b> When available they were often of inferior quality, as Mountfort discovered with the unseasoned wood in his first disastrous project. His first buildings in his new homeland were often too tall, or steeply pitched, failing to take account of the non-European climate and landscape. However, he soon adapted, and developed his skill in working with crude and unrefined materials.|$|E
5|$|Funding {{shortfalls}} have constrained {{the development}} of the F-FDTL. The government has been forced to postpone plans to form an independent company stationed in the Oecussi enclave and two reserve infantry battalions. These units formed {{an important part of the}} King's College report's option3 force structure and <b>their</b> <b>absence</b> may have impacted on East Timor's defence policy. As of 2011 the government was yet to announce what, if any, reserve units would be formed, though provisions for such units had been included in legislation.|$|E
5|$|Geologically, a {{predominant}} {{feature of}} the substrata of Manhattan is that the underlying bedrock base of the island rises considerably closer to the surface near Midtown Manhattan, dips down lower between 29th Street and Canal Street, then rises toward the surface again in Lower Manhattan. It has been widely believed that the depth to bedrock was the primary underlying reason for the clustering of skyscrapers in the Midtown and Financial District areas, and <b>their</b> <b>absence</b> over the intervening territory between these two areas. However, {{research has shown that}} economic factors played a bigger part in the locations of these skyscrapers.|$|E

5|$|In the Fourth Test at Adelaide, both Lindwall and Miller {{broke down}} in the middle of match, leaving Australia two bowlers short. In <b>their</b> <b>absence,</b> Johnston took 5/110 and 2/67 but Australia were unable to force a win. He sent down 587 balls for the entire match. Lindwall and Miller were unable to play in the Fifth Test, and in <b>their</b> <b>absence,</b> the South Africans were able to score heavily. Johnston had a large workload, taking 6/152 and 1/114 as the {{tourists}} won by six wickets to level the series 2–2. On this occasion, Johnston sent down 662 balls for the match. In the last two Tests, Johnston conceded more than 100 runs in three of the four innings with the increased burden in his colleagues' absence; the only previous occasion when he had conceded a century of runs in an innings was in the First Test against England in 1948 when Lindwall broke down mid-match. Johnston was again Australia's leading wicket-taker with 21 wickets, but his average of 35.10 was substantially higher than in previous seasons, as Australia struggled to a 2–2 series result. It was the first time Australia had not won a Test series since the 1938 Ashes tour. Yet, he remained the top ranked ICC Test Bowler for three consecutive years from 1950. His best effort against the South Africans was in the second tour match between Victoria and the tourists, in which he totalled 7/122. Aided by his two ten-wicket match hauls against Queensland, Johnston totalled 59 wickets at 26.47 for the season.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no simple}} way of {{differentiating}} a venomous snake from a non-venomous one merely by using a scale character.

Scale patterns help to indicate the species and from the references, it can be verified if the snake species is known to be venomous or not.|$|E

5|$|Tubman and her brothers, Ben and Henry, {{escaped from}} slavery on September 17, 1849. Tubman {{had been hired}} out to Dr. Anthony Thompson, who owned a large {{plantation}} in an area called Poplar Neck in neighboring Caroline County; it is likely her brothers labored for Thompson as well. Because the slaves were hired out to another household, Eliza Brodess probably did not recognize <b>their</b> <b>absence</b> as an escape attempt for some time. Two weeks later, she posted a runaway notice in the Cambridge Democrat, offering a reward of up to 100 dollars for each slave returned. Once they had left, Tubman's brothers had second thoughts. Ben may have just become a father. The two men went back, forcing Tubman to return with them.|$|E
5|$|Arkane were {{influenced}} by some criticisms of the first Dishonored. Although the difficulty was not considered a major problem, a sizeable number of players had complained the first was too easy, and thus the harder difficulty settings were reworked. The chaos system of Dishonored, considered as merely a binary ersatz meter, was intended more depth in the sequel. The altered chaos system, where different individuals grant varying amounts of chaos, was implemented due to how many players used the Heart in the original game. As the Heart would reveal secrets about whomever it was pointed at, players would use it to decide which NPCs to kill and which to leave be or spare. Also intended to yield additional improvements was the upgrade system, which would {{for the first time}} level up based on a skill tree. Bonecharms were made into craftable items, with 400,000 possible combinations available. While taking into account the intricacies of how supernatural abilities would be used, designers faced increased difficulty in relation to the play-style where the game is traversed in <b>their</b> <b>absence,</b> noting the accommodation of the play-style {{in a way that would}} not cancel out the other as a challenge.|$|E

5|$|At the outset, the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and USCG {{agreed to}} recruit and to train the members of their {{respective}} women's reserves together, using existing Navy facilities. For recruiting purposes, the SPARS would utilize the Offices of the Naval Officer Procurement. Their first recruiting efforts got underway in December 1942, but they were hampered somewhat {{by the absence of}} SPAR recruiting personnel. <b>Their</b> <b>absence</b> resulted from the agreement between the Navy and the USCG, whereby the SPARS would receive its first personnel by transfer from the WAVES. A total of 15 WAVE officers and 153 WAVE enlisted women requested and were discharged from the WAVES to become the first SPARS. Eventually, SPAR officers were assigned to most of the Naval Officer Procurement offices. The recruiting information about SPARS was disseminated with WAVES publicity materials and it was also done separately. But it became apparent that the job of selling the SPARS included selling the USCG as well.|$|E

On December 5, Pole received twenty-six votes, only two short of the requisite two-thirds majority, prompting French ambassador Claude d'Urfé to rush {{to the door of the}} conclave, demanding that the conclave wait for the French cardinals, whom he claimed were in Corsica, and threatening that the election of a pope in <b>their</b> <b>absence</b> would be likely to cause a schism.|$|E
5|$|David {{decides to}} take the lead in {{opposing}} the Conqueror in hopes of earning independence for Athlum, which is currently a vassal state to the city of Celapaleis. The party succeeds in stopping the Conqueror's army from attacking Celapaleis, but the Conqueror himself attacks Athlum in <b>their</b> <b>absence.</b> He kills Emma, who had remained behind to defend the city and takes the massive Remnant of Athlum, shrinking it to a normal-sized sword. The party then returns to Elysion to rescue Irina from Wagram. Irina is revealed to have a special power, that of unbinding bound Remnants, and it was for this reason that she was kidnapped. They discover that Hermeien is trying to use the Conqueror and Wagram to spark distrust in the people for Remnants and the city-states' ability to control them, so that he can then use Irina and her power to prop himself up as supreme ruler. While the party are successful in retaking Irina and killing Hermeien, Wagram escapes while revealing that he and the Conqueror never planned to support Hermeien. Confronted by the Conqueror, Irina uses Nagapur's Remnant to protect her brother, destroying half of the city in the process.|$|E
