5|$|Charles faced a {{political}} storm over his brother James, a Catholic, being {{next in line}} to the throne. The prospect of a Catholic monarch was vehemently opposed by Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury (previously Baron Ashley {{and a member of}} the Cabal, which had fallen apart in 1673). Shaftesbury's power base was strengthened when the House of Commons of 1679 introduced <b>the</b> <b>Exclusion</b> Bill, which sought to exclude the Duke of York from the line of succession. Some even sought to confer the Crown on the Protestant Duke of Monmouth, the eldest of Charles's illegitimate children. The Abhorrers—those who thought <b>the</b> <b>Exclusion</b> Bill was abhorrent—were named Tories (after a term for dispossessed Irish Catholic bandits), while the Petitioners—those who supported a petitioning campaign in favour of <b>the</b> <b>Exclusion</b> Bill—were called Whigs (after a term for rebellious Scottish Presbyterians).|$|E
5|$|Fearing that <b>the</b> <b>Exclusion</b> Bill {{would be}} passed, and bolstered by some acquittals in the {{continuing}} Plot trials, which seemed to him to indicate a more favourable public mood towards Catholicism, Charles dissolved the English Parliament, {{for a second time}} that year, in mid-1679. Charles's hopes for a more moderate Parliament were not fulfilled; within a few months he had dissolved Parliament yet again, after it sought to pass <b>the</b> <b>Exclusion</b> Bill. When a new Parliament assembled at Oxford in March 1681, Charles dissolved it for a fourth time after just a few days. During the 1680s, however, popular support for <b>the</b> <b>Exclusion</b> Bill ebbed, and Charles experienced a nationwide surge of loyalty. Lord Shaftesbury was prosecuted (albeit unsuccessfully) for treason in 1681 and later fled to Holland, where he died. For the remainder of his reign, Charles ruled without Parliament.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to analyse {{exclusions}} and exceptions from patentability which is a negative requirement for an invention to enjoy a patent protection. It aims {{to answer the question}} why <b>the</b> <b>exclusions</b> are needed and whether they should be preserved as some of them proved to be very controversial. The law and practice of the European Patent Office, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom are compared with the emphasis on the European Patent Convention and the EPO's case law. In the national regulation, mainly the differences and peculiarities to the European approach are pointed out. The work is composed of four chapters. The first chapter explains the basic concepts of patent law and presents justifications for patent protection. The second chapter deals with various patent systems and reviews the most important international tools of harmonization. In the third chapter, <b>the</b> <b>exclusions</b> are introduced and the distinction between Article 52 (2) and (3) EPC (exclusions) and Article 53 (exceptions) is clarified whereas it is submitted that the difficulty posed by <b>the</b> <b>exclusions</b> lies in <b>the</b> interpretation of the words "as such" used in Article 52 (3) EPC. The main focus of the thesis lies in chapter four which is subdivided into nine subchapters, each discussing one of <b>the</b> <b>exclusions</b> and [...] ...|$|R
5|$|Like most felines, the bobcat {{is largely}} solitary, but ranges often overlap. Unusual for cats, males are more {{tolerant}} of overlap, while females rarely wander into others' ranges. Given their smaller range sizes, two or more females may reside within a male's home range. When multiple territories overlap, a dominance hierarchy is often established, resulting in <b>the</b> <b>exclusion</b> of some transients from favored areas.|$|E

5|$|Although the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are {{generally}} considered {{the starting point}} of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of demonstrations and actions took place before that date.
