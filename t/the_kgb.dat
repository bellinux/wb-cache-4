5|$|Beginning in 1966, Khrushchev {{began his}} memoirs. He {{dictated}} {{them into a}} tape recorder and recorded indoors, after attempts failed to record outdoors due to background noise, knowing that every word would be heard by <b>the</b> <b>KGB.</b> However, the security agency {{made no attempt to}} interfere until 1968, when Khrushchev was ordered to turn over his tapes, which he refused to do. Khrushchev was hospitalized with heart ailments when his son Sergei was approached by <b>the</b> <b>KGB</b> and told that there was a plot afoot by foreign agents to steal the memoirs. Sergei Khrushchev turned over the materials to <b>the</b> <b>KGB</b> since <b>the</b> <b>KGB</b> could steal the originals anyway, but copies had been made, some of which had been transmitted to a Western publisher. Sergei instructed that the smuggled memoirs should be published, which they were in 1970 under the title Khrushchev Remembers. Under some pressure, Nikita Khrushchev signed a statement that he had not given the materials to any publisher, and his son was transferred to a less desirable job. Upon publication of the memoirs in the West, Izvestia denounced them as a fraud. Soviet state radio carried the announcement of Khrushchev's statement, {{and it was the first}} time in six years that he had been mentioned in that medium. In the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Khrushchev was given a short characterization: ″In his activities, there were elements of subjectivism and voluntarism".|$|E

They escape Bratislava while being pursued by <b>the</b> <b>KGB,</b> crossing over the border into Austria. Meanwhile, Pushkin meets with arms dealer Brad Whitaker in Tangier, informing him that <b>the</b> <b>KGB</b> is cancelling an arms deal previously arranged between Koskov and Whitaker.|$|E
5|$|In {{a seminar}} at the Woodrow Wilson Institute on May 20, 2009, {{and based on}} an {{extensive}} analysis of the Vassiliev notebooks taken from <b>the</b> <b>KGB</b> archives, John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr, and Alexander Vassiliev concluded that Oppenheimer never was involved in espionage for the Soviets. <b>The</b> <b>KGB</b> tried repeatedly to recruit him, but were never successful. Allegations that he had spied for the Soviets are unsupported, and in some instances, contradicted by voluminous KGB and Venona documentation released {{after the fall of}} the Soviet Union. In addition, he had several persons removed from the Manhattan project who had sympathies to the Soviet Union.|$|E
