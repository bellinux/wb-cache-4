40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether two securities {{that have}} identical payoffs, the equity warrant and the exchange <b>traded</b> <b>option,</b> are priced differently {{when they are}} subject to different microstructure issues. The results show that different trading processes, the behaviour of market makers and short-selling restrictions seem to have an effect on relative pricing. This study indicates that, on average, a warrant is priced higher relative to an equivalent option. It appears that this pricing difference may be related to greater liquidity in the warrant market as compared to the option market...|$|E

An appealing feature of nonparametric arbitrage- free derivative pricing is that fitted prices are obtained {{that are consistent with}} <b>traded</b> <b>option</b> prices and are not based on specific restrictions on the underlying asset price process or the functional form of the risk-neutral density. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{a test of the}} {{efficiency}} of the London <b>Traded</b> <b>Options</b> Market. Because it uses the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model, it is also a test of option pricing. In the process of examining call option price behaviour it investigates the effects of three empirical factors. First, it investigates the effect of a non-constant share price volatility. Hitherto, there has been no agreed procedure on modelling or forecasting the future share price volatility. This study shows that the GARCH process has the best forecasting accuracy. The ex ante GARCH volatility estimate is then incorporated in the Black-Scholes model. Because the volatility is assumed constant in the Black-Scholes model, the consideration of adapting the GARCH volatility into the model sheds insight on bridging empirical results and theoretical requirements. Second, because the London <b>Traded</b> <b>Options</b> Market is thinly traded the quoted prices may not reflect prices at which trade did or could take place. However, information on call <b>option</b> <b>trading</b> volume may not be available. This study develops and implements an analytical criterion to select the most actively <b>traded</b> call <b>options.</b> The call options selected by this criterion bear the basic characteristics of those frequently <b>traded</b> call <b>options</b> where <b>trading</b> volume is available. Third, this study uses the bid and ask quotations for shares and call options to test the efficiency of the London <b>Traded</b> <b>Options</b> Market. By incorporating the bid-ask spread directly in the establishment of arbitrage portfolios, an accurate assessment of transactions data can be made. The results of incorporating these factors in the test for market efficiency reveal that, despite the identification of mispriced call options, {{it would not have been}} possible to exploit the mispricing by setting up arbitrage portfolios. It must therefore be concluded that the London <b>Traded</b> <b>Options</b> Market was <b>trading</b> efficiently over the period of this study...|$|R

40|$|The second partial {{derivative}} of a European-style vanilla option {{with respect to}} the current price of the underlying asset—the option gamma—defines a probability density function for the current underlying price. By use of entropy maximization it is possible to obtain an option gamma, from which the associated option pricing formula can be recovered by integration. A number of pricing formulae are obtained in this manner, corresponding to different specifications of the constraints. When the available market information consists solely of a set of <b>traded</b> <b>option</b> prices, the entropic formulation leads to a model-independent calibration procedure. The result thus obtained also allows one to recover the relevant Greeks. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{recent study}} by Professor Marsh of the London Business School has {{estimated}} that sub-underwriters of rights issues (firms that commit to buy up any remaining shares {{at the end of}} a rights issue) make an excess profit of 86 % of the fee they charge. Because of this study, the OFT (who originally commissioned it) have argued that underwriting is too expensive and have encouraged firms to reconsider their issuance techniques. Marsh's study, however, is based on a number of assumptions that are unlikely to hold in practice. In particular, Marsh used the Black and Scholes option pricing formula to value the economic cost of underwriting (underwriting is like a put option since it gives the firm the right but not the obligation to sell shares to the underwriter). But it is well known that the Black and Scholes formula is based on a high unrealistic view of financial markets with no transactions costs and no information asymmetries. To make a more realistic estimate of the economic cost of underwriting, this paper looks at the cost of buying put options in the <b>traded</b> <b>option</b> market. This does not mean that buying a put option in the <b>traded</b> <b>option</b> market is a viable alternative to underwriting it simply allows for a more realistic measure of transactions costs. By looking at the price of put options on firms who have just announced a rights issue the paper funds, unsurprisingly, that the true cost of put options was much higher than the Black and Scholes formula predicted. However, it still found that underwriters made an abnormal profit, even if it was only 40 % of the fee rather than 86 %. ...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{develop an}} option pricing model for calls and puts written on {{leveraged}} equity {{in an economy}} with corporate taxes and bankruptcy costs. The model explains implied Black-Scholes volatility biases by relating them to the firm's structural characteristics such as leverage and debt covenants. The authors test the model by comparing predicted pricing biases with biases observed in a large cross-section of firms with liquid exchange <b>traded</b> <b>option</b> contracts. Their empirical study detects leverage related pricing biases. The magnitudes of these biases correspond to those predicted by their model. The authors also find significant pricing biases for firms financed primarily by short-term debt. This supports their model because short-term debt introduces net-worth hurdles similar to net-worth covenants. Copyright 1997 by American Finance Association. ...|$|E
40|$|The key {{contribution}} {{in this paper}} is to provide a new approach in estimating the physical distribution of the underlying asset return by using a quadratic Radon-Nikodym derivative function. The latter function transforms a fitted Variance Gamma risk-neutral distribution that is obtained from <b>traded</b> <b>option</b> prices. The generality of the VG distribution helps to avoid unnecessary mis-specification bias. The estimated empirical distribution is then used to find the risk measure of VaR. We show that possible underestimation of VaR risk using existing methods is largely not due to VaR itself but perhaps due to mis-specification errors which we minimize in our approach. Our method of measuring VaR clearly captures large tail risk in the empirical examples on S 2 ̆ 6 P 500 index...|$|E

40|$|We use a {{controlled}} economic experiment {{to examine the}} implications of asymmetric information for informational linkages between a stock market and a traded call option on that stock. The setting {{is based on the}} Kyle model and Back (1993). We find that an insider trades aggressively in both the stock and the option, and that this leads to important feedback effects between the two markets: price discovery in the stock market also occurs in the option market and vice versa. The time series properties of the stock price depend directly on the intrinsic value of the option: when the intrinsic value of the option is positive, informational efficiency is higher in the market for the stock, and volatility is lower. We argue that this provides new insights into how the introduction of a <b>traded</b> <b>option</b> improves the market quality of the underlying asset. experimental economics; financial derivatives; information asymmetry; market microstructure...|$|E
