40|$|This {{article is}} the third {{one in a series}} of papers by the authors on vanishing-viscosity {{solutions}} to rate-independent damage systems. While in the first two papers [KRZ 13, KRZ 15] the assumptions on the spatial domain Ω were kept as general as possible (i. e. nonsmooth domain with mixed boundary conditions), we assume here that ∂Ω is smooth and that the type of boundary conditions does not change. This smoother setting allows us to derive enhanced regularity spatial properties both for the displacement and damage fields. Thus, we {{are in a position to}} work with a stronger solution notion at the level of the viscous approximating system. The vanishing-viscosity analysis then leads us to obtain the existence of a stronger solution concept for the rate-independent limit system. Furthermore, in comparison to [KRZ 13, KRZ 15], in our vanishing-viscosity analysis we do not switch to an artificial arc-length parameterization of the trajectories but we stay with the true physical time.

The switching and modulating properties of the memristor which we have considered endow the circuit with two discontinuity boundaries and multiple equilibrium points as well. As the Jacobian matrices about these equilibrium points are non-invertible, they are non-hyperbolic, some of these admit local bifurcations as well. Consequently when these equilibrium points are perturbed, they lose their stability giving rise to quasiperiodic orbits.

Commonly, q takes its values in some set Q, suitably structured for the velocity u to be introduced as the derivative of t→ q, when it exists. This, in fact, makes sense if Q is a topological linear space or, more generally, a differential manifold modelled on such a space. For smooth situations, classical dynamics rests, in turn, on the consideration of the acceleration. This is the derivative of t → u, if it exists in the sense of the topological linear structure of Q, or, when Q is a manifold, in the sense of some connection. But, from its early stages, classical dynamics has also had to face shocks, i. e. velocity jumps. For isolated shocks, one traditionally resorts to the equations of the dynamics of percussions. Even in the absence of impact, it has been known for a long time that systems submitted to such nonsmooth effects as dry friction may exhibit <b>time</b> <b>discontinuity</b> of the velocity. Furthermore, nonsmooth mechanical constraints may also prevent t→ u from admitting a derivative.

The bistability nature of the memristor introduces two discontinuty boundaries or switching manifolds in the circuit topology. As a result, the circuit becomes a piecewise smooth system of second order. Grazing bifurcations, which are essentially a form of discontinuity induced non-smooth bifurcations, occur at these boundaries and govern {{the dynamics of the}} circuit. While the interaction of the memristor aided self oscillations of the circuit and the external sinusoidal forcing result in the phenomenon of beats occurring in the circuit, grazing bifurcations endow them with chaotic and hyper chaotic nature. In addition the circuit admits a codimension- 5 bifurcation and transient hyper chaos. Grazing bifurcations as well as other behaviors have been analyzed numerically using time series plots, phase portraits, bifurcation diagram, power spectra and Lyapunov spectrum, as well as the recent 0 - 1 K test for chaos, obtained after constructing a proper Zero <b>Time</b> <b>Discontinuity</b> Map (ZDM) and Poincare Discontinuity Map (PDM) analytically.

The Taylor-Proudman theory does apply since the derivatives {{in the direction of the}} rotation axis vanishes rapidly. A closer analysis reveals that the dissipation rate of the incompressible component of the turbulent kinetic energy indeed decreases with a higher rotation rate, consistent with incompressible flow simulations (Bardina), while the dissipation rate of the compressible part increases; the net gain is positive.
