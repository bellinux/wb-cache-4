5|$|Fermi {{was among}} the first to warn {{military}} leaders about <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>impact</b> of nuclear energy, giving a lecture on the subject at the Navy Department on 18March 1939. The response fell short of what he had hoped for, although the Navy agreed to provide $1,500 towards further research at Columbia. Later that year, Szilárd, Eugene Wigner, and Edward Teller sent the famous letter signed by Einstein to U.S. President Roosevelt, warning that Nazi Germany was likely to build an atomic bomb. In response, Roosevelt formed the Advisory Committee on Uranium to investigate the matter.|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objectives}} of {{this phase of}} the Gulf Coast Study were to assemble the data needed for an analysis of <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>impacts</b> on transportation, determine whether climate and ecological data could be usefully employed in such an assessment, identify and implement an assessment approach, and provide an overview of <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>impacts.</b> <b>The</b> results are striking. They show that the data can provide useful information to transportation decision-makers about the natural environment as it exists today, as well as the likely changes stemming from climate shifts. By using the historical data on the natural environment, an ensemble of climate models, a range of emission scenarios, wellestablished literature on climate impacts, and a conservative approach toward interpretation, this study indicates that <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>impacts</b> on transportation in the Gulf Coast are highly significant, as summarized below. While further study is needed to examine in more detail the impacts on specific transportation facilities, such as individual airports or rail terminals, this preliminary assessment finds that <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>impacts</b> on infrastructure are so important that transportation decision-makers should begin immediately to assess consider them in th...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>impacts</b> {{caused by}} <b>the</b> loss of active {{environmental}} control measures during the aftercare period of landfill management. A combined mechanistic solute flow model and {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA) approach {{was used to evaluate}} <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>impacts</b> of leachate emissions over a 10, 000 year time horizon. A continuum of control loss possibilities occurring at different times and for different durations were investigated for four different basic aftercare scenarios, including a typical aftercare scenario involving a low permeability cap and three accelerated aftercare scenarios involving higher initial infiltration rates. Assuming a ‘best case’ where control is never lost, <b>the</b> largest <b>potential</b> <b>impacts</b> resulted from <b>the</b> typical aftercare scenario. The maximum difference between <b>potential</b> <b>impacts</b> from <b>the</b> ‘best case’ and the ‘worst case’, where control fails at the earliest possible point and is never reinstated, was only a fourfold increase. This highlights potential deficiencies in standard life cycle impact assessment practice, which are discussed. Nevertheless, the results show how the influence of active control loss on <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>impacts</b> of landfilling varies considerably depending on the aftercare strategy used and highlight the importance that leachate treatment efficiencies have upon impact...|$|R

5|$|Banksia prionotes is {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} threatening processes. It is highly {{susceptible to}} Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback; wild populations are harvested commercially by the cut flower industry; and some of its range is subject to land clearing for urban or agricultural purposes. An assessment of <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>impact</b> of climate change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to a reduction in its range of around 50% by 2080; and even mild change is projected to cause a reduction of 30%; but under mid-severity scenarios the distribution may actually grow, depending on how effectively it can migrate into newly habitable areas. However, this study does not address the potential of climate change to alter fire regimes; these have already been impacted by the arrival of humans, and this change is thought to have led to a decline in the abundance and range of B.prionotes.|$|E
5|$|Chris Beveridge's {{review for}} Fandom Post was highly {{positive}} towards the anime series, {{calling it a}} dark horse contender {{as one of their}} top new anime series of the year. Beveridge praised the technical and fundamental aspects of magic in the series for breaking the supernatural approach other works usually take and liked <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>impact</b> it could have on future events. However, while the reviewer liked the series' technicality, they noted it will frustrate certain viewers in that aspect. Richard Eisenbeis, writing for Kotaku, liked the characters, story, the complex and technical magic system, and mysteries. However, Eisenbeis criticized the exposition, citing it to be poorly timed, heavy, and failing to explain things with better clarity. He concluded his review by writing how the anime might have been great if a different director or screenwriting was hired.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> environmental <b>impacts</b> {{associated with}} denying a renewed operating license (OL) (i. e., the no-action alternative); <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> environmental <b>impacts</b> from electric generating sources other than {{renewal of the}} Edwin I.

The impacts are evaluated using a three-level standard of significance—SMALL, MODERATE, or LARGE—based on Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) guidelines. These significance levels are as follows: SMALL: Environmental effects are not detectable or are so minor that they will neither destabilize nor noticeably alter any important attribute of the resource. MODERATE: Environmental effects are sufficient to alter noticeably, but not to destabilize important attributes of the resource. LARGE: Environmental effects are clearly noticeable and are sufficient to destabilize important attributes of the resource. 8. 1 No-Action Alternativ...|$|R

By 9.00am on the morning after the accident, a hastily convened coroner's jury was assembled in the Grapes public house in Eccles. The coroner himself, MrMilne, arrived at 10.00am and was in a hurry to proceed as he had another inquest scheduled that afternoon, but proceedings were unable to begin as Lord Wilton, the only sworn witness scheduled to attend the inquest, could not be found. In the meantime, Milne sent the jury to the vicarage to view Huskisson's body.|$|E

5|$|Planning for a bypass around Northam {{began in}} the 1960s. The {{original}} route through the town centre functioned as both a local access road and primary traffic route, including for heavy vehicles. There were particular concerns {{with the amount of}} traffic congestion, frequency of crashes, and the noise and visual pollution of the highway's traffic. Twelve different alignments were considered for the bypass, which were narrowed down to three options by the 1990s. In 1993 the Environmental Protection Authority assessed the proposal, and found that only the route that deviated furthest away from the townsite would be environmentally acceptable. The closer routes were not acceptable due to <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>impact</b> on the Avon River. The project gained the Minister for the Environment's conditional approval on 24 June 1994. Construction of the Northam bypass began in January 2001, with the new road opened on 17 May 2002.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>potential</b> <b>impact</b> of {{thiomersal}} on autism {{has been}} investigated extensively. Multiple lines of scientific evidence have shown that thiomersal does not cause autism. For example, the clinical symptoms of mercury poisoning differ significantly from those of autism. In addition, multiple population studies have found no association between thiomersal and autism, and rates of autism have continued to increase despite removal of thiomersal from vaccines. Thus, major scientific and medical bodies such as the Institute of Medicine and World Health Organization (WHO) as well as governmental {{agencies such as the}} Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC reject any role for thiomersal in autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. In spite of the consensus of the scientific community, some parents and advocacy groups continue to contend that thiomersal is linked to autism.|$|E
5|$|The {{survival}} {{of this species}} is tied closely to rainfall because of the susceptibility of seedlings to drought. It is thus especially vulnerable {{to the effects of}} climate change. This was recognised as early as 1992, when it was noted that winter rainfall in the Quairading region had been falling by about 4% per decade, and that a continuation of this trend may reduce the species' distribution. Recently, a more thorough assessment of <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>impact</b> of climate change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to extinction, and mild change to a reduction of its range by 80% by 2080. However, there may not be any range reduction at all under mid-severity climate change, depending on how effectively this species can migrate into newly habitable areas.|$|E
