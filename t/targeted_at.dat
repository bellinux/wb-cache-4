50|$|At {{the same}} time, Westinghouse won the {{contract}} to develop the AN/APQ-81 radar for the aircraft. This was an advanced pulse-Doppler radar system with a maximum range against bomber-sized <b>targets</b> <b>at</b> about 120 mi, {{and was able to}} track eight <b>targets</b> <b>at</b> a time in its track while scan mode at up to 80 mi. The radar also broadcast midcourse corrections to the missiles, and was in charge of calculating their lofted trajectories. The 120 mi range of the AN/APQ-81 meant the Eagle could not be fired at its maximum effective range of 160 mi, but the Eagle also had a home-on-jam capability that allowed it to attack <b>targets</b> <b>at</b> its maximum range, although this was reduced in practice as it did not use midcourse corrections and flew directly <b>at</b> the <b>target</b> <b>at</b> lower altitudes.|$|R

(2) Fixed near: accommodative demands from 1 to 5 D were created by placing the near <b>target</b> <b>at</b> 16. 7 cm and the far <b>target</b> <b>at</b> various distal positions. (3) Fixed amplitude: far and near target positions were changed to create an accommodative demand of 1. 5 D from starting posi-tions of 1 to 4. 5 D in 0. 5 -D steps.
