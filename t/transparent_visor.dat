500|$|On August 10, 2013, two {{snippets of}} the song leaked online. Gaga urged fans to [...] "please take these down as much as possible" [...] and {{provided}} {{instructions on how to}} report information regarding the unauthorized distribution of her song to her label's parent company, Universal Music Group. In response, fans reported websites seen distributing or linking to the snippets of the single, with nearly 2,500 individuals sending a singular link to Universal's takedown page. However, despite such efforts, a leak was eminent. So Gaga released the song a week early onto various radio stations across America. The single was made available in most countries just before midnight (EST) on the iTunes Store, coupled with a pre-order of Artpop. Following day, Gaga was seen in goth costume with clown-like face paint similar to the [...] "Applause" [...] artwork, at various promotional events. The Huffington Post compared the style-shift to Marilyn Manson, saying: [...] "With her black hair slicked back, a face full of white powder and her black blazer and shirt combo, Gaga could have easily been mistaken for Manson if it wasn't for her towering heels." [...] Gaga also premiered a short clip of [...] "Applause" [...] that quoted harsh journalism that attacked her credibility as an artist. In the video, Gaga was seen sitting naked in a white room and wearing a <b>transparent</b> <b>visor.</b> The sound of an audience booing and jeering was heard in the background. Direct quotations from critics and detractors appeared {{at the bottom of the}} video, which included: [...] "Lady Gaga is over"and [...] "Do not buy Lady Gaga's new single 'Applause'". The clip was construed as an attempt at reverse psychology.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} {{story as}} written by Aykroyd {{was much more}} ambitious—and unfocused—than what would be eventually filmed; in Aykroyd's original vision, a group of Ghostbusters would travel through time, space and other dimensions taking on huge ghosts (of which the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man {{was just one of}} many). Also, the Ghostbusters wore SWAT-like outfits and used Proton Packs to fight the ghosts; Ghostbusters storyboards show them wearing riot squad-type helmets with movable <b>transparent</b> <b>visors.</b> The original draft of the script written by Aykroyd was very large, compared to a [...] "phone book" [...] by director Ivan Reitman.|$|R
5000|$|The movie's {{concept was}} {{inspired}} by Dan Aykroyd's fascination with the paranormal. Aykroyd conceived it {{as a vehicle for}} himself and his friend and fellow Saturday Night Live alumnus John Belushi. The original story, as written by Aykroyd, was very different from what was eventually filmed. In the original version, a group of [...] "Ghostsmashers" [...] traveled through time, space, and other dimensions combating huge ghosts (of which the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man was one of many). They wore SWAT-like outfits and used wands instead of proton packs to fight the ghosts. (Original storyboards show them wearing riotsquad-type helmets with movable <b>transparent</b> <b>visors.)</b> In addition to a similar title, the movie shares the premise of professional [...] "exterminators" [...] on a paranormal mission with The Bowery Boys slapstick comedy Spook Busters (1946, directed by William Beaudine) {{as well as with the}} 1937 Disney short Lonesome Ghosts. Lonesome Ghosts includes the line [...] "I ain't scared of no ghost".|$|R
5000|$|In 1989, Lego further its storyline {{direction}} {{with the}} introduction of Space Police to oppose Blacktron, since police and robbers were popular sellers in its Lego Town theme. The Space Police sets had a black, blue, with red transparent color scheme and the minifigures shared the torso design with the black Futuron minifigure, but with a <b>transparent</b> red <b>visor.</b> This would be the first time that Lego had a [...] "bad guy", [...] "good guy" [...] and [...] "civilian" [...] faction, a theme that would be used for the next decade. Space Police also utilized modular systems but on a smaller scale by featuring a Space Police jail cell that could be used interchangeably among almost all sets and came with a Blacktron occupant.|$|R

50|$|In one {{suggested}} protocol, chimpanzees {{are given}} first-hand experience of wearing two mirrored visors. One of the visors is transparent {{whereas the other}} is not. The visors themselves are of markedly different colours or shapes. During the subsequent test session, the chimpanzees are {{given the opportunity to}} use their species-typical begging behaviour to request food from one of the two humans, one wearing the <b>transparent</b> <b>visor</b> and the other wearing the opaque. If chimpanzees possess ToM, it would be expected they would beg more often from the human wearing the <b>transparent</b> <b>visor.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In 1987, Lego added [...] "factions" [...] to its space theme {{with the}} {{introduction}} of Blacktron and the new subtheme based on space exploration was given the name [...] "Futuron". The new line kept the white and blue color scheme used in the later years of [...] "Classic" [...] Space but redesigned its minifigures. They came in four colors (red, blue, yellow and black), but had a new design with a zipper crossing from hip to shoulder and the color on top with white below, as well as utilizing a newly redesigned helmet that had a <b>transparent</b> light blue <b>visor.</b> Instead of a large spaceship, the theme centered around the Monorail Transport System, which featured a battery-powered train system and some twenty linear feet of track.|$|R
5000|$|In 1990, Lego {{designed}} {{its next}} theme around magnets and M:Tron {{took over the}} [...] "civilian" [...] role of the Futuron faction. Vehicles in this set, distinctive for their red hulls, gray and black trim and transparent neon green canopies, are devoted primarily to exploration or mining and was the only civilian Space theme to not include any bases. They often featured crane-like attachments with magnets for picking up small cargo and storage boxes. These boxes, unfortunately, were generally not interchangeable. The figures wore white trousers, a red shirt with an [...] "M" [...] logo in the middle, and a black helmet with <b>transparent</b> neon green <b>visor.</b> This theme also extensively used brick-built robot figures to assist the M:Tron spacemen. These were the last sets produced under the [...] "Legoland" [...] banner before Lego began branding their sets as Lego System.|$|R
40|$|An {{article of}} {{laminate}} construction is disclosed which {{is comprised of}} an underlayer of polycarbonate polymer material to which is applied a chemically resistant outer layer of polysulfone. The layers which are joined by compression-heat molding, are molded to form {{the shape of a}} body protective shell such as a space helmet comprising a shell of polycarbonate, polysulfone laminate construction attached at its open end to a sealing ring adapted for connection to a space suit. The front portion of the shell provides a <b>transparent</b> <b>visor</b> for the helmet. An outer visor of polycarbonate polysulfone laminate construction is pivotally mounted to the sealing ring for covering the <b>transparent</b> <b>visor</b> portion of the shell during extravehicular activities. The polycarbonate under layer of the outer visor is coated on its inner surface with a vacuum deposit of gold to provide additional thermal radiation resistance...|$|E
40|$|The general {{spirit and}} intent of Augmented Reality (AR) {{is to add}} virtual objects to the real world. A typical AR {{apparatus}} consists of a video display with partially <b>transparent</b> <b>visor,</b> upon which computer-generated information is overlayed. The general spirit of what is proposed, like typical AR, includes adding virtual objects, but also includes the desire to take away, alter, or more generally to visually `mediate' real objects, using a body-worn apparatus where both the real and virtual objects are placed on an equal footing, {{in the sense that}} both are presented together via a synthetic medium. Successful implementations have been realized by viewing the real world using a head-mounted display (HMD) fitted with video camera(s), body-worn processing, and/or bidirectional wireless communications. This portability enabled various forms of the apparatus to be tested extensively in everyday circumstances, such as while riding the bus, or shopping. The proposed approach shows promise [...] ...|$|E
