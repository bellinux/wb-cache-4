5|$|However, not all inhibitors {{are based}} on the {{structures}} of substrates. For example, the structure of another HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir is shown on the left. This molecule is not based on a peptide and has no obvious structural similarity to a protein substrate. These non-peptide inhibitors can be more stable than inhibitors containing peptide bonds, because <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> substrates for peptidases and {{are less likely to be}} degraded.|$|E

Before he leaves, Harry says that Robert will be the ruin of the company and says <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> working for Dunder Mifflin in six months, leaving a look of concern on Dwight and Jim's faces.|$|E

5|$|Animated {{television}} advertisements starring the transgender playboy cow Graham Heffer {{ran from}} 1999 until 2002. The adverts attracted complaints {{from the public}} for allegedly promoting bestiality, homosexuality and drug-taking. Boddingtons become an official partner of the 2002 XVII Commonwealth Games held in Manchester in a deal worth at least £1million. To mark the occasion, a special Boddingtons 5% ABV Commonwealth Ale cask ale was produced for the North West of England, and subsequently launched nationwide. The last Boddingtons television advertising campaign in 2005 was criticised for capitalising on the beer's Manchester heritage with a Happy Mondays soundtrack, even though production had {{moved out of the}} city. Mike Thompson, a former worker at the brewery and representative of the Transport & General Workers' Union, said: This is at best cynical and at worst a slur on our great city, its heritage and the Strangeways workers. People have lost their livelihoods because of how this company has behaved. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> best pleased at what we can only see as pouring salt on the wounds.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 and 2009, {{personnel}} shortages {{reduced the}} number of submarines able to be deployed to three; the maintenance cycles of Sheean, Rankin, and Dechaineux, and problems with Collins and Waller further reducing this to one, Farncomb, in mid-2009. Farncomb was docked for repair after a generator malfunction in February 2010, by which point Collins and Waller were active (the former on limited duties because of defects), and Dechaineux was slated to re-enter service by May 2010. Workforce shortages and malfunctions on other submarines during the preceding two years impacted heavily on the maintenance of Sheean and Rankin, with RAN and ASC officials predicting that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> active until 2012 and 2013, respectively. In June 2011, The Australian newspaper claimed despite two submarines (Waller and Dechaineux) designated as operational, neither was in sailable condition. The initial findings from the Coles Review revealed significant, systemic problems with the submarines and noted the need for their management to be reformed. A 2014 statement by Vice Admiral Ray Griggs indicated that up to four submarines had been operational on most occasions since 2012.|$|E
40|$|There are {{two kinds}} of {{contraction}}s: verb contraction and negative or not contraction. Forms like he's <b>not,</b> they'll <b>not</b> <b>are</b> called verb contraction because the verbs or auxiliary verbs are contracted, whereas forms like isn't, won't are called negative or not contraction because <b>not</b> <b>is</b> contracted. The objective {{of this article is to}} find out the extent to which these two kinds of contractions occur in American newsweeklies and which of these two forms is more frequently used in them. Uncontracted forms like he <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>not,</b> <b>are</b> also included for comparison. The material examined here is Newsweek and TIME...|$|R

5|$|In March 2006, {{contractors}} halted construction {{because of}} fears that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> paid. This caused Morningstar to reconsider their lease commitment. As a result, {{the value of}} the project declined, which made the resale of the project rights difficult. Mills was close to a deal with German investment firm, Deutsche Immobilien Fonds A.G. prior to the difficulties. DIFA had outbid Chicago developer Golub & Co., which then became the frontrunner. Golub, an international real estate investment company headquartered in Chicago, has closed on the office space portion of the project. Mills eventually sold the retail space rights to Chicago developer Joseph Freed & Associates, who had previously purchased the nearby Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building (located at 1 South State Street) that closed in early 2007.|$|E

The two survive {{the night in the}} cabin and set out on foot the next morning. They finally make it to Santa's workshop, only to find a dark, gloomy factory in a dreary, polluted, lifeless wasteland; Santa a sickly and {{depressed}} old man, the elves all horribly mutated and inbred due to Santa's attempts {{to keep up with the}} increasing gift demands year after year, and the reindeer carnivorous, feral monsters that eat the elves who wander out into the snow to die of exhaustion. Santa suddenly collapses and is too sick to deliver the presents. Brian and Stewie agree to do it, but end up wasting an hour and a half at their first house after the family discover their presence, before discovering they were in the wrong house. Realizing that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to complete the delivery in time, and understanding firsthand the impossibility of Santa's job, Stewie and Brian abandon the delivery in lieu of another plan.|$|E
