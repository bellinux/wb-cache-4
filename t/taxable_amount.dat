40|$|The {{effects of}} {{amortization}} on {{the presentation of}} the financial statements are quite noticeable when calculating the profit before tax as well as for its recognition in the balance sheet. Accounting amortization changes the value of the fixed assets itemized in the assets column, while the related expense changes the profit and loss account. Tax amortization does not affect the performance of the enterprise, but only the <b>taxable</b> <b>amounts.</b> The differences between accounting amortization and tax amortization generate temporary differences that are either taxable or deductible, and these are matters that will be analysed under circumstances when the deferred tax method is applied. The recognition {{of the value of the}} deferred tax in the profit and loss account for each type of temporary difference would be a step towards the separation of financial accounting from taxation...|$|R
50|$|A {{key factor}} in income inequality/equality is the {{effective}} rate at which income is taxed coupled with the progressivity of the tax system.

5000|$|A {{proportional}} tax {{is a tax}} imposed so that the tax rate is fixed, with no change as the <b>taxable</b> base <b>amount</b> increases or decreases.

5000|$|Specifically, a {{progressive}} tax {{is a tax}} by which the tax rate increases as the <b>taxable</b> base <b>amount</b> increases. [...] "Progressive" [...] describes a distribution effect on income or expenditure, referring {{to the way the}} rate progresses from low to high, where the average tax rate is less than the marginal tax rate. It can be applied to individual taxes or to a tax system as a whole; a year, multi-year, or lifetime. Progressive taxes attempt to reduce the tax incidence of people with a lower , as they shift the incidence increasingly to those with a higher ability-to-pay.|$|R
25|$|Another {{cause is}} {{the rate at}} which income is taxed coupled with the {{progressivity}} of the tax system. A progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the <b>taxable</b> base <b>amount</b> increases. In a progressive tax system, the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society, either increasing it or decreasing it, provided that income does not change {{as a result of the}} change in tax regime. Additionally, steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board. The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.|$|R
50|$|The Internal Revenue Code imposes severe {{restrictions}} on withdrawals of tax-deferred or Roth contributions while a person remains in service {{with the company}} and is {{under the age of}} 59½. Any withdrawal that is permitted before the age of 59½ is subject to an excise tax equal to ten percent of the amount distributed (on top of the ordinary income tax that has to be paid), including withdrawals to pay expenses due to a hardship, except to the extent the distribution does not exceed the amount allowable as a deduction under Internal Revenue Code section 213 to the employee for amounts paid during the taxable year for medical care (determined without regard to whether the employee itemizes deductions for such <b>taxable</b> year). <b>Amounts</b> withdrawn are subject to ordinary income taxes to the participant.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of other {{important}} details that govern different situations. For Roth IRAs with only contributed funds the basis can be withdrawn before age 59½ without penalty (or tax) on a first in first out basis, and a penalty would apply only on any growth (the <b>taxable</b> <b>amount)</b> that was taken out before 59½ where an exception didn't apply. Amounts converted from a traditional to a Roth IRA must stay in the account for a minimum of 5 years to avoid having a penalty on withdrawal of basis unless one of the above exceptions applies.|$|E
5000|$|The federal {{gift tax}} is {{applicable}} to the donor, not the recipient, and is computed based on cumulative taxable gifts, and is reduced by prior gift taxes paid. The federal estate tax is computed on the sum of taxable estate and taxable gifts, and is reduced by prior gift taxes paid. These taxes are computed as the <b>taxable</b> <b>amount</b> times a graduated tax rate (up to 35% in 2011). The estate and gift taxes are also reduced by a [...] "unified credit" [...] equivalent to an exclusion ($5 million in 2011). Rates and exclusions have varied, {{and the benefits of}} lower rates and the credit have been phased out during some years.|$|E
5000|$|A {{progressive}} tax {{is a tax}} in which the tax rate increases as the <b>taxable</b> <b>amount</b> increases. The term [...] "progressive" [...] refers {{to the way the}} tax rate progresses from low to high, with the result that a taxpayer's average tax rate is less than the person's marginal tax rate. The term can be applied to individual taxes or to a tax system as a whole; a year, multi-year, or lifetime. Progressive taxes are imposed in an attempt to reduce the tax incidence of people with a lower , as such taxes shift the incidence increasingly to those with a higher ability-to-pay. The opposite of a {{progressive tax}} is a regressive tax, where the relative tax rate or burden decreases as an individual's ability to pay increases.|$|E
50|$|Hand pays {{also occur}} {{whenever}} {{the amount of}} the win is over the minimum <b>taxable</b> win <b>amount</b> for the jurisdiction that the machine is in. This allows the floor attendant to collect the patron's identification and tax ID numbers (such as the Social Security number in the United States) and other pertinent information, such as the winning combination. The patron is then provided with the applicable tax forms. In the United States, a hand pay will normally occur for all wins over $1,200, which is the amount above which winnings must be reported to the IRS; some states may have lower thresholds where the taxes must be reported to the state revenue office. Citizens of the United States winning in that country will receive a W-2G tax form, and often a W-9 form to validate that the Social Security number they provided is correct.|$|R
