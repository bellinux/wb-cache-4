5|$|By 1965 pirate radio had a British {{audience}} of 10 to 15 million, and by 1966 sold almost £2million worth of advertising {{a year to}} customers including the government-funded Egg Marketing Board. Radio Caroline's audience was one third {{the size of the}} Light Programme in the parts of <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>where</b> it could be received, but the Light Programme's audience did not decrease, indicating that pirate radio appealed to an audience that the BBC did not serve.|$|E

The population of the breed has been in decline since 1985, despite government promotion of the breed.|$|E

5|$|Iravan, {{also known}} as Iravat and Iravant, is a minor {{character}} from the Hindu epic of Mahabharata. The son of Pandava prince Arjuna (one of the main heroes of the Mahabharata) and the Naga princess Ulupi, Iravan is the central deity of the cult of Kuttantavar {{which is also the}} name commonly given to him in that cult—and {{plays a major role in}} the cult of Draupadi. Both these cults are of Tamil origin, from a region of <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>where</b> he is worshipped as a village deity and is known as Aravan. He is also a patron god of well-known transgender communities called ThiruNangai (also Aravani in Tamil, and Hijra throughout South Asia).|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{management}} of hyperthyroidism may include drugs that suppress thyroid function such as propylthiouracil, carbimazole and methimazole. Radioactive iodine-131 {{can be used}} to destroy thyroid tissue. Radioactive iodine is selectively taken up by the thyroid, which over time destroys the cells involved in its uptake. The chosen first-line treatment will depend on the individual and on <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>where</b> being treated. Surgery to remove the thyroid can sometimes be performed as a transoral thyroidectomy, a minimally-invasive procedure. Surgery does however carry a risk of damage to the parathyroid glands and the nerves controlling the vocal cords. If the entire thyroid gland is removed, hypothyroidism will naturally result, and thyroid hormone substitutes will be needed.|$|E
5|$|Nigersaurus {{was named}} and {{described}} {{in more detail}} by Sereno and colleagues only in 1999, based on remains of newly found individuals. The same article also named Jobaria, another sauropod from Niger. The genus name Nigersaurus ("Niger reptile") is a reference to <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>where</b> it was discovered, and the specific name taqueti honours Taquet, who was the first to organise large-scale palaeontological expeditions to Niger. The holotype specimen (MNN GAD512) consists of a partial skull and neck. Limb material and a scapula found nearby were also referred to the same specimen. These fossils are housed at the National Museum of Niger.|$|E

5|$|Parseghian was the {{youngest}} of three children born to an Armenian father and a French mother in Akron, Ohio. His father, Michael, had come to the United States from Turkey in 1915, fleeing the Armenian Genocide during World War I and settling in part of <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>where</b> there was a large Armenian population. Despite his mother's protectiveness, Parseghian became involved in sports from an early age, and developed a reputation as the toughest kid in his class. He was hired by Akron's Board of Education in the eighth grade to patrol his school's grounds at night to deter vandals.|$|E
5|$|The policy {{commenced}} {{during the}} final years of the Ottoman Empire and continued into the Turkish Republic. Under the Kemalist oriented government, specialized governmental commissions were created for the purpose of changing names. Approximately 28,000 topographic names were changed, which included 12,211 village and town names and 4,000 mountain, river, and other topographic names. Most name changes occurred in the eastern regions of <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>where</b> minority ethnicities form a large part or a majority of the population. Policies at times included banning the use of foreign names that were considered divisive and inappropriate.|$|E

5|$|During the 10th century, a {{small number}} of stone keeps began to be built in France, such at the Château de Langeais: in the 11th century, their numbers {{increased}} as the style spread through Normandy across the rest of France and into England. Some existing motte-and-bailey castles were converted to stone, with the keep amongst usually the first parts to be upgraded, while in other cases new keeps were built from scratch in stone. These stone keeps were introduced into Ireland during the 1170s following the Norman occupation of the east of <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>where</b> they were particularly popular amongst the new Anglo-Norman lords. Two broad types of design emerged across France and England during the period: four-sided stone keeps, known as Norman keeps or great keeps in English – a donjon carré or donjon roman in French – and circular shell keeps.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic Khmers have a poor {{perception}} of the Vietnamese community, due to persistent feelings of communal animosity from the past history of Vietnamese rule over Cambodia. In 1958, a survey conducted by Donald Willmott upon {{high school students in}} Phnom Penh showed that relations with Chinese were generally rated as friendly, whereas Khmer students viewed their Vietnamese classmates with suspicion. Relations between the Vietnamese and Chinese are considerably better, as both ethnic groups share a close cultural affinity. Chinese males sometimes take Vietnamese wives, particularly in Phnom Penh and eastern parts of <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>where</b> there are large Chinese and Vietnamese communities. In recent years, field research carried out by Ehrentraut in 2013 suggested that ethnic relations between Vietnamese have deteriorated not only with the ethnic Khmer, but also with the Cham and Chinese Cambodians.|$|E
5|$|For a time, no overt {{action was}} taken, and the plans {{continued}} to evolve. A further refinement {{of the plan}} was developed by William and McGeorge Bundy on 29 November 1964, with a more moderate target list, which the Joint Chiefs opposed. No action was taken while these, and other, plans were considered. But matters {{came to a head}} with the attack on Camp Holloway on 7 February 1965, which demanded immediate action, and resulted in a reprisal raid known as Operation Flaming Dart. A sapper raid against an American enlisted men's billet at Qui Nhon on the 10th led to Flaming Dart II. These small-scale operations were launched against the southern region of <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>where</b> the bulk of North Vietnam's ground forces and supply dumps were located.|$|E

5|$|In 1771, the Tây Sơn {{rebellion}} {{erupted from}} Bình Định Province. In 1777, {{the last of}} the Nguyễn lords was deposed and killed. His nephew Nguyen Phuc Anh was the most senior member of the Nguyễn family to have survived the Tây Sơn victory and conquest of Saigon in 1777. Nguyễn Ánh fled to Hà Tiên in the far south of <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>where</b> he met Pigneau de Behaine, a French priest who became his adviser and played a large part in his rise to power. Over the next few decades, there were continuous attacks and counterattacks by both sides and Saigon changed hands frequently. Eventually, Nguyễn Ánh was forced him into exile. The Tây Sơn regularly raided the rice growing areas of the south during the harvesting season, confiscating the Nguyễns' supply of food.|$|E
5|$|On July 13, 1995, Cameron County {{officials}} and state authorities traveled to Mexico City to ask Mexican officials to prosecute Puentes Pizaña and Olivarez for Fischer's murder. Thousands of documents were translated from English to Spanish {{and handed over}} to Mexico's attorney general for review. On July 15, Mexican officials agreed to prosecute both of them for the murder in an international prosecution court in Mexico City. Texas prosecutors asked the Mexican government to use Article 4 of the Mexican Federal Penal Code, a little-used provision that permits Mexican citizens to be prosecuted in Mexico for crimes they committed outside the country. In order for the provision to take effect, it required the accused to be in Mexican territory; not to have faced justice in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>where</b> the crime was committed; and that the crime was not only illegal in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>where</b> it was committed, but also in Mexico. Murder in Mexico carries a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison, though {{it is common for}} people to be released after 15 to 25 years for good behavior. The Cameron County office said they would use a federal prosecutor from Tamaulipas as the judge. The two accused would be issued an arrest warrant and asked to appear in court where a federal judge would review their case and determine the punishment in a few months. When Puentes Pizaña heard the news, he was surprised and angered by the decision. He maintained his innocence saying he was only a car thief. Olivarez was in custody in a Matamoros prison. On September 20, a Mexican federal judge agreed to prosecute Puentes Pizaña and Olivarez for the murder. Both of them were eventually found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison.|$|E
