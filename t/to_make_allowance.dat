2500|$|The {{philosophers}} John Leslie and Nick Bostrom {{reject the}} Barrow and Tipler SAP {{as a fundamental}} misreading of Carter. For Bostrom, Carter's anthropic principle just warns us <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowance</b> for anthropic bias—that is, the bias created by anthropic selection effects (which Bostrom calls [...] "observation" [...] selection effects)—the necessity for observers to exist {{in order to get}} a result. He writes: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, Elsie!" [...] {{returned}} the youth, as he shook hands, [...] "you ought in fairness <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowance</b> {{for the effects}} of spring. You know full well that the glare of the sun on the snow half blinds a fellow, so that even when, when--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All one's faculties {{have their}} play," [...] said Richard. [...] "I may be {{treading}} on dangerous ground; but what I feel about poets and artists {{in general is}} this: on your own lines, you can't be beaten--granted; but off your own lines--puff--one has <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowances.</b> Now, I shouldn't {{like to think that}} any one had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowances</b> for me." ...|$|R
60|$|Moody {{was in no}} humor <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowances</b> for the {{unbridled}} gayety {{of youth}} and good spirits.|$|R
60|$|The Babe was one {{of those}} {{thoroughly}} excellent persons who always try, when possible, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowances</b> for everybody.|$|R
60|$|Whatever Isabel's {{obligations}} {{may have}} been to Mr. Osmond, it must be admitted that she found them sufficient to lead her to put to Ralph sundry questions about him. She thought Ralph's judgements distorted by his trials, but she flattered herself she had learned <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowance</b> for that.|$|E
60|$|It {{was found}} rather {{difficult}} to get the sledge into the hut, as Nazinred had forgotten <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowance</b> for its size, but by enlarging the door and manoeuvring, the difficulty was overcome--a matter of considerable importance, for there was no knowing what Arctic monsters might take a fancy to play havoc with its contents while its owner slept.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir!" [...] cried Mr. Lorry, {{thoroughly}} heated by his indifference, [...] "business is a {{very good}} thing, and a very respectable thing. And, sir, if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr. Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowance</b> for that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you, sir! I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy life.--Chair there!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{altering}} {{your opinion}} about Laura," [...] she said. [...] "You are readier <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowances</b> for her {{than you were}} yesterday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They're consistent, if {{not always}} very logical," [...] she {{concluded}} after a pause. [...] "One endeavors <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowances</b> for men of that description." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{found his}} manner trying, but one has <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowances.</b> I was telling myself that I should {{be seeing a}} very {{different}} Gussie after lunch.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said he, [...] "it's {{all very}} well for you to say, `What has come over you?' but you ought <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowance</b> {{for a man who}} has carried a heavy load all the forenoon. Besides, he was almost beyond range. Moreover, {{although}} I have hunted a good deal, I really have not been in the habit of firing at animal locomotives under full steam. Did you ever see such a slapping pace and such an outrageous pair of legs, Ralph?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Guy," [...] he said, [...] "you {{know that}} if I leave you behind, you link your lot with--them. You will be an outcast and a {{fugitive}} all your days. You will have to avoid every place where the English language is spoken. You {{will never be able}} to recover your honour, you will be the scorn of all Englishmen and English--women. I speak to you for your mother's sake, boy. You have started life with a cursed heritage. I want <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowance</b> for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Dick admitted, [...] "she's too ambitious. But then Molly's all right. A cussed little fool {{to tackle}} a trip like this, but a plucky sight {{better than those}} pick-me-up-and-carry-me kind of women. She's the stock that carried you and me, Tommy, and you've got <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowance</b> for the spirit. Takes a woman to breed a man. You can't suck manhood from the dugs of a {{creature}} whose only claim to womanhood is her petticoats. Takes a she-cat, not a cow, to mother a tiger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I trust Sir George Templemore {{knows how}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowances</b> for Mr. John Effingham's pictures," [...] cried Grace, unable {{to refrain from}} expressing her discontent any longer.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{imagine he}} meant mother; they {{sometimes}} clash," [...] she said. [...] "You don't know Bernard yet. When you do, you will try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowances,</b> {{like the rest}} of us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose that}} follows, but I {{would prefer to}} think you are fair enough <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowances</b> {{for a man who}} tried {{to do the right thing}} in a {{difficult}} situation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's honest on my part, {{knowing the}} people with whom I have to deal. If I were to lay down the strict minimum which he should grant, he would add other things which would cause him to act not in {{accordance}} with my advice. I have <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowance</b> for his folly,--a sort of windage, which is not dishonest. Had he referred her lawyers to me I could have been as hard and honest as you please." [...] All which did not quite satisfy Dolly's strict ideas of integrity.|$|E
60|$|Am always feeling {{how strong}} is his aversion to seeing {{more than he}} can help of what is sordid, mean, ignoble. He has not been in public life all these years without rubbing {{shoulders}} with plenty of baseness on every scale, and plenty of pettiness in every hue, but he has always kept his eyes well above it. Never was a man more wholly free of the starch of the censor, more ready <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowance,</b> nor more indulgent even; he enters into human nature in all its compass. But he won’t linger a minute longer than he must in the dingy places of life and character.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is naught <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowance</b> for," [...] {{the countess}} said gently. [...] "Women can {{appreciate}} simple truth, and are not, as men seem to think, always yearning for compliments. Those {{who are most}} proficient in turning phrases are not often among those foremost in battle, or wisest in council, and I {{can tell you that}} we women value deeds far higher than words. Sir Fabricius Caretto is a cousin of mine, and has this afternoon been speaking so highly of you to me and my young daughter here, that I am glad indeed to make your acquaintance. How long do you intend to stay in Genoa?" ...|$|E
50|$|A {{correspondent}} pleads {{on behalf}} of young actors, suggesting urging theatre critics <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowances</b> for nervousness and inexperience. Johnson extends the appeal to young poets, then to young people in general.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{reminded}} {{myself that}} one has got <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowances</b> for a woman with only about half a spoonful of soup inside her, and I checked the red-hot crack that rose to the lips.|$|R
6000|$|Appleby, who fancied he {{understood}} his man, smiled. “I scarcely think it is. Nobody attaches much importance to a trifling dispute in a café. One has also <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowances</b> {{in moments of}} political excitement.” ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY GIOVANNA. [...] I will. You know sick people, More {{specially}} sick children, have strange fancies, Strange longings; and {{to thwart}} {{them in their}} mood May work them grievous harm at times, may even Hasten their end. I would you had a son! It might be easier then for you <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>Allowance</b> for a mother--her--who comes To rob you of your one delight on earth. How often has my sick boy yearn'd for this! I have put him off as often; but to-day I dared not--so much weaker, so much worse For last day's journey. I was weeping for him: He gave me his hand: 'I should be well again If the good Count would give me---- ...|$|E
60|$|Little Mary Carbonel was not {{the worse}} for all the agitations, from which, indeed, {{she had been so}} {{carefully}} shielded, but her mother was sadly broken down by all she had undergone, and likewise by mortification at the whole conduct of the Uphill people. After all the years {{that she and her husband}} and sisters had striven for them, it was very hard to find that so very few would exert themselves for their protection, and that so many would even turn against them. It was hard <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowance</b> for the bewilderment of slow minds, for sheer cowardice, and for the instinct of going along with one's own class of people. She and Sophy prayed that they might forgive the people, but it was impossible just then not to feel that there was a good deal to forgive, and Captain Caiger was always telling them that all their trouble came in trying to help the good-for-nothing people.|$|E
60|$|After the {{tackling}} {{was prepared}} {{and in good}} working order, it took me {{the greater part of}} a day to hoist the main topsail. As I could not steer and work at this at the same time, I lashed the helm in such a position that, with a little watching now and then, it kept the schooner in her proper course. By this means I was enabled, also, to go about the deck and down below for things that I wanted as occasion required; also to cook and eat my victuals. But I did not dare to trust to this plan during the three hours of rest that I allowed myself at night, as the wind might have shifted, in which case I should have been blown far out of my course ere I awoke. I was, therefore, in the habit of heaving-to during those three hours--that is, fixing the rudder and the sails in such a position as that, by acting against each other, they would keep the ship stationary. After my night's rest, therefore, I had only <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowance</b> for the leeway she had made, and so resume my course.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor Alda! It is a {{hard time}} for her, {{and she is not}} used to it. I am afraid she is out of her element among you all. Don't be vexed, Clem; you all ought <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowances</b> for her.' ...|$|R
60|$|Festing {{thought this}} was {{doubtful}} praise, although it bore out his opinion of the girl. For all that, Sadie {{might not be so}} willing <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowances</b> for her husband as for a lover of whom she was not quite sure.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} away because I have had dinner enough, and wine enough," [...] {{answered}} the Count. [...] "Be so kind, Percival, as <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowances</b> for my foreign habit {{of going out}} with the ladies, as well as coming in with them." ...|$|R
60|$|Next morning Mildred was sulky and taciturn. She {{remained}} {{in her room}} till {{it was time to}} get the dinner ready. She was a bad cook and could do little more than chops and steaks; and she did not know how to use up odds and ends, so that Philip was obliged to spend more money than he had expected. When she served up she sat down opposite Philip, but would eat nothing; he remarked on it; she said she had a bad headache and was not hungry. He was glad that he had somewhere to spend the rest of the day; the Athelnys were cheerful and friendly. It was a delightful and an unexpected thing to realise that everyone in that household looked forward with pleasure to his visit. Mildred had gone to bed when he came back, but next day she was still silent. At supper she sat with a haughty expression on her face and a little frown between her eyes. It made Philip impatient, but he told himself that he must be considerate to her; he was bound <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowance.</b>|$|E
60|$|Roland Graeme {{had spent}} {{about an hour}} in grumbling against Catherine Seyton, the Queen, the Regent, and the whole house of Lochleven, with George Douglas {{at the head of}} it, when the time {{approached}} that his duty called him to attend the meal of Queen Mary. As he arranged his dress for this purpose, he grudged the trouble, which, on similar occasions, he used, with boyish foppery, to consider {{as one of the most}} important duties of his day; and when he went to take his place behind the chair of the Queen, it was with an air of offended dignity, which could not escape her observation, and probably appeared to her ridiculous enough, for she whispered something in French to her ladies, at which the lady Fleming laughed, and Catherine appeared half diverted and half disconcerted. This pleasantry, of which the subject was concealed from him, the unfortunate page received, of course, as a new offence, and called an additional degree of sullen dignity into his mien, which might have exposed him to farther raillery, but that Mary appeared disposed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowance</b> for and compassionate his feelings.|$|E
60|$|To Mr. Gilbert Burns, especially, let my sentiments be conveyed, with my sincere respects, {{and best}} wishes {{for the success}} of his praise-worthy enterprize. And if, through modest apprehension, he should doubt of his own ability to do justice to his brother's memory, let him take {{encouragement}} from the assurance that the most odious part of the charges owed its credit to the silence of those who were deemed best entitled to speak; and who, it was thought, would not have been mute, had they believed that they could speak beneficially. Moreover, it may be relied on as a general truth, which will not escape his recollection, that tasks of this kind are not so arduous as, to those who are tenderly concerned in their issue, they may at first appear to be; for, if the many be hasty to condemn, there is a re-action of generosity which stimulates them--when forcibly summoned--to redress the wrong; and, for the sensible part of mankind, they are neither dull to understand, nor slow <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowance</b> for, the aberrations of men, whose intellectual powers do honour to their species.|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, trett {{had fallen into}} disuse,with merchants preferring <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>{{allowance}}s</b> in the price for any impurity, as such allowance was far easier than the arithmetic calculation for trett. It was not used at custom houses, nor was it available at the British East India Company's warehouses.|$|R
50|$|We are {{confident}} that the knowledge and experience of CPMI experts will help improve the efficiency in large-scale projects and programs management systems, allowing not only to correctly plan the budgets, but to also employ well-timed measures in minimizing risks, as well as <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowances</b> <b>to</b> achieve initial objectives.|$|R
60|$|I cannot tell to {{the full}} how Marion thwarted me and failed in that life of {{intimate}} emotions which is the kernel of love. That life of intimate emotions {{is made up of}} little things. A beautiful face differs from an ugly one by a difference of surfaces and proportions that are sometimes almost infinitesimally small. I find myself setting down little things and little things; none of them do more than demonstrate those essential temperamental discords I have already sought <b>to</b> <b>make</b> clear. Some readers will understand--to others I shall seem no more than an unfeeling brute who couldn't <b>make</b> <b>allowances....</b> It's easy <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowances</b> now; but <b>to</b> be young and ardent and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>allowances,</b> <b>to</b> see one's married life open before one, the life that seemed in its dawn a glory, a garden of roses, a place of deep sweet mysteries and heart throbs and wonderful silences, and to see it a vista of tolerations and baby-talk; a compromise, the least effectual thing in all one's life.|$|R
