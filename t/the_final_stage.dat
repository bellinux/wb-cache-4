5|$|Borgarello won {{his second}} stage with his {{victory in the}} seventh stage, out-sprinting Micheletto and Carlo Durando.

The police then moved the two riders to a bar, until the crowd dispersed. Micheletto won his second stage of the race two days later. Before the start of <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>stage,</b> Micheletto became sick and Pavesi {{convinced}} him to continue the race and finish <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>stage.</b> Borgarello won his third stage of the race, while Atala-Dunlop consolidated their lead and the race win by having two riders, Micheletto and Galetti, finish in the top four.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is divided}} into four {{different}} single-screen stages. Each represents 25 meters of the structure Donkey Kong has climbed, one stage being 25 meters higher than the previous. <b>The</b> <b>final</b> <b>stage</b> occurs at 100 meters. Stage one involves Mario scaling a construction site made of crooked girders and ladders while jumping over or hammering barrels and oil drums tossed by Donkey Kong. Stage two involves climbing a five-story structure of conveyor belts, each of which transport cement pans. The third stage involves the player riding elevators while avoiding bouncing springs. <b>The</b> <b>final</b> <b>stage</b> involves Mario removing eight rivets which support Donkey Kong. Removing the final rivet causes Donkey Kong to fall and the hero {{to be reunited with}} Pauline. These four stages combine to form a level.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>final</b> <b>stage</b> {{occurs when}} a massive star begins {{producing}} iron. Since iron nuclei are more tightly bound than any heavier nuclei, any fusion beyond iron does not produce a net release of energy. To a very limited degree such a process proceeds, but it consumes energy. Likewise, since they are more tightly bound than all lighter nuclei, such energy cannot be released by fission.|$|E
