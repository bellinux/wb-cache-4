500|$|Most of the {{cartoons}} Davenport drew during the 1896 campaign were simple in execution and somber in mood. One, for example, depicts Hanna walking down Wall Street, bags {{of money in}} each hand and a grin on his face. [...] Another shows only Hanna's hand and wristâ€”and McKinley dangling from his fob chain. [...] One that {{is intended to be}} funny depicts McKinley as a small boy accompanied by Hanna as nursemaid; McKinley <b>tugs</b> <b>at</b> Hanna's skirts, wanting to go into a shop where the labor vote is for sale. [...] Another shows Hanna wearing a Napoleon hat (McKinley was said to resemble the late emperor), raising a mask of McKinley's face to his own.|$|E
500|$|Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{gave the}} film {{a rating of}} 4 out of 5, calling it [...] "a must-see for its {{interpretation}} of modern-day romance... Anjaana Anjaani is an unpretentious romantic saga that revels in the exuberance of newly found love." [...] He also broadly praised the acting, styling and cinematography, writing: [...] "The film bears a magnificent look all through and the panoramic and exotic locales of America only make every frame stand out." [...] Daily News and Analysis gave it a rating of 3.5 out of 5, saying that it stood apart from [...] "other done-to-death rom-coms in Hindi cinema in the sheer exclusivity of its screenplay {{and the way the}} subject is developed ... Here, at last, is a romantic comedy from Bollywood that actually does what rom-coms are supposed to do. Anjaana Anjaani <b>tugs</b> <b>at</b> your heartstrings {{while at the same time}} tickling your funny bone." [...] It also praised Chopra's performance as [...] "engagingly brilliant".|$|E
500|$|The EEF {{controlled}} the coastal sea lanes, and the Intelligence Service spread rumours about possible sea landings {{in the rear}} of Gaza. Ships were seen taking soundings off the coast and a fleet of small boats was located near Deir el Belah. During the late afternoon of 1 November, an embarkation of members of the Egyptian Labour Corps onto motor launches, trawlers and <b>tugs</b> <b>at</b> Deir el Belah was staged as a feint, giving the appearance of continuing into the night. The next morning, two trawlers appeared off the mouth of the Wadi el Hesi north of Gaza. To add to the confusion, between the Battle of Beersheba on 31 October and the main attacks at the Battle of Hareira and Sheria beginning on 6 November, the Ottoman left flank north of Beersheba was being fiercely contested during the Battle of Tel el Khuweilfe for control of the road to Hebron and Jerusalem. According to Wavell, [...] "an assault on a portion of the Gaza defences was to be made by the XXI Corps." [...] The date of this attack, which was primarily a feint, was scheduled for between 24 and 48 hours before the attack on Sheria.|$|E

500|$|The film {{opens with}} an inter-title that reads [...] "Poor little rich girl has {{no one to}} play with" [...] and cuts to Baby Helen with her doll, looking out the window. A group of {{children}} play Ring a Ring o' Roses in the yard. Next, Baby Helen goes to tea party {{set up on the}} yard and holds her doll, all by herself, with a lonely expression. The neighbor's dog, Shep comes out of his dog house and barks, and Baby Helen rises with a joyful expression. She takes a piece of a muffin and tosses it through the boxwood hedge separating the two yards. Shep eats the muffin and Helen invites him to her tea party. Shep runs along the hedge and passes through to join her. Helen instructs Shep with her finger and Shep barks in understanding, Helen takes her seat and shares a muffin with Shep. An inter-title announces that a week later, Helen is out on an errand. Helen passes through the hedge and skips down the sidewalk and Shep barks at her. As Helen crosses the street, she is struck by a passing automobile and Shep races to the rescue. He <b>tugs</b> <b>at</b> her dress at the waist and finding that he is unable to move her, runs to Helen's home and jumps against the screen door, barking repeatedly. As Helen's parents are summoned, Shep leads them to Helen, where a passerby has scooped up Helen {{from the middle of the}} street. All three depart and the scene changes to a dimly lit room with Helen laid on a bed, seemingly dead. Her parents watch over her, with sad faces as a doctor inspects her and folds her arms across her chest. Beyond saving, her parents bury their heads in the pillow next to Helen as the doctor pens a note. Then Shep is shown resting against the side of the door in a feeble and sorrowful looking position.|$|E
2500|$|We agonised {{over the}} {{inclusion}} of [...] "Yesterday" [...] in the show. It is such a famous song, the icon of an era, but had it been heard too much? The story of {{the addition of the}} original string quartet is well known, however, few people know how limited the recording was technically, and so the case for not including it was strong, but how could we ignore such a marvellous work? We introduced it with some of Paul's guitar work from [...] "Blackbird", and hearing it now, I know it was right to include it. Its simplicity is so direct; it <b>tugs</b> <b>at</b> the heartstrings.|$|E
2500|$|Brooklyn {{received}} {{a standing ovation}} at its Sundance Film Festival premiere. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 97%, based on 222 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "Brooklyn buttresses outstanding performances from Saoirse Ronan and Emory Cohen with a rich period drama that <b>tugs</b> <b>at</b> the heartstrings as deftly as it satisfies the mind." [...] Writing for The Student Pocket Guide, James Jones praised Ronan as [...] "the lynchpin of the film, captivating the camera with her electric-blue eyes as it focuses on her in tight close-up, capturing her transformation from a rather uninspiring girl to a confident young woman".|$|E

2500|$|Phoenixes were {{reinforced}} concrete caissons constructed by civil engineering contractors around {{the coast of}} Britain, collected and sunk at Dungeness and Pagham prior to D-Day. There were six different sizes of caisson (from approximately 2,000 tons to 6,000 tons each) and each unit was towed to Normandy by two <b>tugs</b> <b>at</b> around three knots. The caissons were initially sunk awaiting D-Day and then engineers refloated ("resurrected", hence the name) the Phoenixes and US Navy Captain (later Rear Admiral) Edward Ellsberg, already well known for quickly refloating scuttled ships at Massawa and Oran, {{was brought in to}} accomplish the task, though not without obtaining Churchill's intervention in taking the task away from the Royal Engineers and giving it to the Royal Navy. The Phoenixes, once refloated, were towed across the channel to form the [...] "Mulberry" [...] harbour breakwaters together with the [...] "Gooseberry" [...] block ships. Ellsberg rode one of the concrete caissons to Normandy; once there he helped unsnarl wrecked landing craft and vehicles on the beach.|$|E

Batfish arrived at the Will Brothers Port of Muskogee Terminal on 7 May 1972: this was her temporary home until a [...] wide, [...] trench could be dug to the boat's permanent berthing site. On 4 July 1972, while still at Muskogee Terminal, Batfish was unofficially opened to the public. Heavy spring rains flooded the Arkansas River on 12 March 1973, which caused Batfish to strain at her moorings, with fears that she would rip loose and damage the surrounding docks or collide with the new U.S. Route 62 bridge downriver and block the channel. Although the submarine remained moored, the Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation Commission wanted to return the submarine to the Navy. However, the Navy expected Oklahoma to honor its contract.|$|E

2500|$|... "Beauty and the Beast" [...] {{continues}} to be constantly lauded by both film and music critics alike. Film critic Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised [...] "Beauty and the Beast", describing it as [...] "a glorious ballad" [...] while dubbing it Ashman and Menken's [...] "biggest triumph". Beliefnet called the song [...] "stirring", while Hal Hinson of The Washington Post considers it {{to be among the}} film's best. Roger Moore of the Chicago Tribune referred to [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] as a [...] "brilliant" [...] song that [...] "can move you to tears," [...] while James Berardinelli of ReelViews cited it among the film's most [...] "memorable" [...] songs. Anthony Quinn of The Independent highlighted [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] as the film's best song, going on to praise Lansbury's [...] "magnificent" [...] performance, while the Deseret News Chris Hicks called it [...] "beautiful." [...] Simon Brew of Den of Geek specifically enjoyed the lyrics [...] "bittersweet and strange, finding you can change," [...] describing the song as [...] "superb." [...] Lansbury's vocal performance has also been singled out for praise: Slant Magazines Jaime N. Christley wrote that Lansbury [...] "delivers the film's title tune, gooey treacle that it is, like nobody's business." [...] Describing the song as [...] "beautiful", the Chicago Tribunes Gene Siskel wrote that [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] is [...] "performed poignantly by the richly textured voice of Angela Lansbury." [...] Similarly, PopMatters' Bill Gibron penned, [...] "the moment Angela Lansburyâ€™s trite teapot steps up to sing the title song, all dry eye bets are off." [...] The New York Posts Lou Lumenick wrote that [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] was [...] "unforgettably delivered by Angela Lansbury." [...] Aylin Zara of BuzzFeed opined that Lansbury's version is superior to the single, penning, [...] "Though the commercial pop version of 'Beauty and the Beast,' sung by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson, is great, the film version â€” performed by Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Potts â€” is even better. Tender and warm ... it <b>tugs</b> <b>at</b> all the right heartstrings to get your eyes a little misty." [...] Rachael Monaco of AXS cited [...] "Tale as old as time. Tune as old as song. Bittersweet and strange. Finding you can change. Learning you were wrong. Certain as the sun rising in the East. Tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme, Beauty and the Beast" [...] as the film's best lyric. Entertainment Weeklys Darren Franich, however, admitted to preferring [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] and [...] "Belle" [...] over [...] "Beauty and the Beast".|$|E
