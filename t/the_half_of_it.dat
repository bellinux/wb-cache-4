2500|$|On {{the night}} of the murder, 16/17 December 1916, Rasputin was invited to Felix's {{apartment}} at the Moika Palace. He was told that Irina would be in residence and Rasputin would have an opportunity to meet her. Rasputin had often expressed interest in meeting the beautiful 21-year-old princess. Irina, however, was on a visit to the Crimea. Irina had been aware that Felix had talked about eliminating Rasputin and it was originally intended that she participate in the murder. [...] "You too must take part in it," [...] Felix wrote to her before the murder. [...] "Dm(itri) Pavl(ovich) knows all about it and is helping. It will all take place in the middle of December, when Dm(itri) comes back." [...] In late November 1916, Irina wrote to Felix: [...] "Thanks for your insane letter. I didn't understand <b>the</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> I see that you're planning to do something wild. Please take care and do not get mixed up in any shady business. The dirtiest thing is that you have decided to do it all without me. I don't see how I can take part in it now, since it's all arranged... In a word, be careful. I see from your letter that you're in a state of wild enthusiasm and ready to climb a wall... I'll be in Petrograd on the 12th or 13th, so don't dare do anything without me, or else I won't come at all." ...|$|E

60|$|So saying, he put Ting-a-ling gently {{down upon}} the table.

60|$|France was a wreck, a ruin, a desolation. <b>The</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> {{belonged to}} England, with none to dispute or deny the truth; {{the other half}} belonged to nobody--in three months would be flying the English flag; the French King was making ready to throw away his crown and flee beyond the seas.|$|E

60|$|Yes, {{our project}} is to go home next autumn if we find {{we can afford to}} live in New York. We've asked a friend to inquire about flats and expenses. But perhaps nothing will come of it.

60|$|But {{she did not}} {{understand}} him; nor perhaps was it very likely that she should understand him.

This was what he intended her to understand;--but she did {{not understand}} <b>the</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|Cecily Foster {{came down}} the sloping, fir-fringed road from the village at a leisurely pace. Usually she walked with a long, {{determined}} stride, but to-day the drowsy, mellowing influence of the Autumn afternoon was strong upon her and filled her with placid content.
