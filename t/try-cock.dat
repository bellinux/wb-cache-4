25|$|Vertical glass tubes, {{known as}} water gauges or water glasses, show {{the level of}} water in the boiler and are {{carefully}} monitored at all times while the boiler is being fired. Before the 1870s it was more common to have a series of try-cocks fitted to the boiler within reach of the crew; each try cock (at least two and usually three were fitted) was mounted at a different level. By opening each <b>try-cock</b> and seeing if steam or water vented through it, the level {{of water in the}} boiler could be estimated with limited accuracy. As boiler pressures increased the use of try-cocks became increasingly dangerous and the valves were prone to blockage with scale or sediment, giving false readings. This led to their replacement with the sight glass. As with the injectors, two glasses with separate fittings were usually installed to provide independent readings.|$|E
