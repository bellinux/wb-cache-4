25|$|The University follows <b>the</b> <b>semester</b> {{calendar}} {{beginning in}} mid-July and ending in early-May. About 90% {{of the students}} are residential. The Master's programme is usually of 2 years while the M.Phil and Ph.D programme are of 18 months and 5 years respectively.|$|E
25|$|The University {{follows the}} {{continuous}} assessment pattern, with 40% marks awarded through assignments spread out through <b>the</b> <b>semester</b> and 60% through semester-end examinations. Grading is on a 10.0 point scale, with D being the lowest passing grade, and A+ being the highest. The toppers post-graduate courses are awarded medals.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the English progress of first-year students of Economics in Nagasaki University by comparing their G-TELP (Level 3) scores {{in the first and}} second <b>semesters</b> of 2011. <b>The</b> 264 students took the test twice－one in <b>the</b> first <b>semester</b> and <b>the</b> other in <b>the</b> second <b>semester.</b> <b>The</b> average total score in <b>the</b> second <b>semester</b> was significantly higher than that of <b>the</b> first <b>semester.</b> A more in-depth analysis revealed the following tendencies: (a) those who scored higher in <b>the</b> first <b>semester</b> tended to produce much lower scores in the second semester; (b) conversely, those who scored lower in <b>the</b> first <b>semester</b> tended to score much higher in all sections of the test in <b>the</b> second <b>semester.</b> This suggests that the classes were more effective for lessproficient students of English than for students with higher degrees of English proficiency. The declining scores of the more-proficient students in <b>the</b> second <b>semester</b> might be in part because the classes were not offered on a proficiency basis. In conclusion, {{the findings of this study}} would seem to suggest that serious measures need to be taken to improve the English proficiency of the students with higher scores and not just the low-level ones. 是枝正啓教授、内田滋教授定年退職記念号In Honour of Prof. Masahiro Koreeda and Prof. Shigeru Uchid...|$|R
