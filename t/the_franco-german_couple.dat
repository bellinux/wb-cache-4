40|$|The thesis {{will define}} Italian {{contribution}} to European {{integration in the}} field of Security and Defence Policy. The first objective of this research is to describe how Italy placed itself in the debate on the development of ESDP if compared to <b>the</b> <b>Franco‐German</b> <b>couple</b> and the British approach: two opposing views dominated this debate: Atlanticism and the “autonomous” approach to European Defence. The former has been supported by the UK and other countries; The latter has been supported by <b>the</b> <b>Franco‐German</b> <b>couple</b> and other countries. Italy has often placed in between, by assuring conformity of the European initiatives with NATO, while promoting a stronger cooperation in a European framework. The thesis analyses in depth the Italian defence policy, the contribution to the European military and civilian capabilities and operations, the participation of Italian high brass in ESDP and NATO structures, the industrial interests in European defence industry and in the intergovernmental cooperation in armaments. The research utilise the Foreign Policy Analysis method, by means of a three level: transatlantic level (relations between US and European allies through NATO); European (relation between Anglo‐ Italians and Franco‐German approaches) internal (the interests of main Italian stakeholders: Politicians, Military, Diplomats and Industry). The main findings are that Italy had given to the ESDP a more sound contribution than expected. This is mainly due to the cooperation with the UK and the bureaucratic interests of the internal administrative actors. Italy is together with France is the first troops contributor for the EU military capabilities. The British‐Italian cooperation has led to new concepts for the ESDP, such as the headline goal and has boosted the military operation in the bilateral, NATO, and ESDP framework. Italy has been leading in the civilian capabilities and operations, in particular in Police Missions and Civil Protection. The Italian defence industry is emerging as a key actor in the European and US markets. The lack of a consistent national security and defence policy, because the ruling class is not interested, boosts the bureaucratic interests of the administrative élites that are shaping the role of Italy in the development of ESDP...|$|E

25|$|Political unity & solidarity: Future of the European Union is {{increasingly}} reliant on {{the unity of}} <b>the</b> <b>Franco-German</b> political leadership <b>couple</b> and {{the willingness of the}} EU-3 to undertake radical structural reforms. Global geopolitical distractions had resulted in UK and France momentarily stepping back and allowing Germany to pilot the European project. Germany resists the idea of sovereign debt mutualisation between Eurozone members. While the EU-3 continue to be gridlocked over their competing and increasingly divergent visions for Europe, the bureaucracy in Brussels has lurched from one crisis to the next without purposeful direction.|$|R
