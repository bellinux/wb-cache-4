500|$|Inside the dorm, {{common area}} {{furnishings}} are Jacobean {{in style and}} architectural features include plaster ceilings, windows with tracery, and wood paneling. Within rooms, closets and windows are also notably large and soft light is present throughout the hall. The building was designed to house 130 students split between two double rooms and 126 singles, but now fits up to 202 students, demonymously referred to as [...] "Cushlings". The house presently includes single dorms, one-room doubles, and two-room doubles and triples. Upon opening in 1927 (prior to Vassar's 1969 transition from being an all-female to co-ed college), the dormitory was limited to housing freshmen. It is now co-ed and acts as home to students from all grades including, as of 1999, the highest proportion of upperclassmen of any dorm at the school. Bathrooms are shared by all members of a hall. A minor renovation in summer 1995 and funded by the Estée Lauder Companies included more efficient lighting, rewiring, and new furniture for <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> <b>Like</b> all other Vassar dorms, Cushing houses a game room, a laundry room, and a Steinway grand piano.|$|E
500|$|Champion {{held out}} for several hours, {{wounding}} three of the vigilantes, and {{was said to have}} killed four others. Another settler by the name of Jack Flagg passed by Champion's ranch on his wagon together with his stepson and witnessed the siege. The Invaders recognized Jack Flagg as one of the men on the list and they started shooting at him. Flagg then rode away and as the Invaders gave chase, he grabbed his rifle and beat them back. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. [...] "Boys, I feel pretty lonesome just now. I wish there was someone here with me so we could watch all sides at once," [...] he wrote. The last journal entry read: [...] "Well, they have just got through shelling <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>like</b> hail. I heard them splitting wood. I guess they are going to fire the house tonight. I think I will make a break when night comes, if alive. Shooting again. It's not night yet. The house is all fired. Goodbye, boys, if I never see you again." ...|$|E

For the Shabbat is a queen and a bride. This is why the masters of the Mishna {{used to go out}} on the eve of Shabbat to receive her on the road, and used to say: Come, O bride, come, O bride!' And one must sing and rejoice at the table in her honor ... one must receive the Lady with many lighted candles, many enjoyments, beautiful clothes, and a house embellished with many fine appointments ..." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the second}} session of the 113th Congress neared its midpoint, {{identical}} legislation, the World War I Memorial Act of 2014 (S. 2264; H.R. 4489), was introduced by McCaskill in the Senate and Cleaver in <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> <b>Like</b> the Poe legislation, the bills designated the Liberty Memorial as [...] "a" [...] National World War I Museum and Memorial. The bills also authorized a National World War I Memorial in Washington, D.C. But unlike the Poe bill, the McCaskill/Cleaver legislation authorized the World War I Centennial Commission to oversee design and construction of this memorial, and specified {{that it should be}} built in Pershing Park. The bills specifically barred the National World War I Memorial from interfering or encroaching on the D.C. memorial, which won them the backing of Delegate Norton, D.C. Council chair Phil Mendelson, and the World War I Centennial Commission—which had recommended the site. The memorial would cost about $10 million, and retain the Pershing commemorative work already at the site. Edwin Fountain, now a member of the World War I Centennial Commission, pledged an open design competition and said that, if the legislation passed, the commission would seek to have the memorial completed by November 11, 2018—the centennial of the closing date of the war.|$|E

60|$|Siegmund rose to look, {{and it was}} so.
