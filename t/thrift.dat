40|$|The {{history of}} {{conversions}} of mutual <b>thrifts</b> to stock <b>thrifts</b> provides important perspectives on more recent credit union conversions. From the middle 1970 s {{to the early}} 1990 s, undercapitalized mutual <b>thrifts</b> used conversions to raise capital. Since then, however, converting <b>thrifts</b> typically already had considerable capital and economic value, which was transferred from mutuals’ members to insiders and outside investors. Long-ignored proposals addressed the capital and conversion problems of mutual <b>thrifts,</b> {{as well as of}} credit unions. In 1977, the US Government Accounting Office proposed that, in lieu of converting, mutual <b>thrifts</b> be allowed to count some bonds as capital. In 1973, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board proposed that, to avoid unwarranted transfers of wealth, converting mutuals should distribute stock on the basis of members’ deposit histories...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to greater restrictions on thrifts' non-traditional assets under FIRREA, Congress is considering new legislation forcing <b>thrifts</b> {{to convert to}} banks. Hence, the efficiency implications of product diversification for <b>thrifts</b> is an important issue. We examine the relation between thrifts' movement into non-traditional assets and the operating inefficiency of adequately capitalized stock <b>thrifts</b> in 1988 and 1994. We estimate inefficiency scores for individual <b>thrifts</b> for each year using a stochastic cost-frontier methodology. In a second step, we regress these scores against measures for movement into non-traditional assets. We find a significant fall in inefficiency with a rise in holdings of both traditional and non-traditional assets. Our results suggest that greater diversification privileges for <b>thrifts</b> should be beneficial {{to the health of}} the industry.

40|$|The 1980 s S&L debacle is {{generally}} {{viewed as the}} result of: (1) sharply rising interest rates eliminating the net worth of <b>thrifts</b> funding fixed-rate loans with short-term deposits and (2) <b>thrifts</b> responding by taking even greater interest-rate and credit risks. The question investigated in this paper is how vulnerable do <b>thrifts</b> remain to an interest rate experience like that which triggered the 1980 s S&L debacle? The short answer is that <b>thrifts</b> are even more vulnerable in 1989 {{than they were in}} 1977. The dollar volume of fixed-rate mortgages funded by short-term deposits in 1989, $ 400 billion, is slightly greater now than it was in 1977, and <b>thrifts</b> have also put over $ 325 billion of adjustable-rate loans with rate caps on their balance sheets. A sharp rise in interest rates (the one-year Treasury rate rose by 9 percentage points between 1977 and 1981) would cause significant losses on these capped loans, {{as well as on the}} fixed-rate loans. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} the continuing problem of predatory lending abuses in the subprime home mortgage lending market and {{federal and state}} attempts to address the problem. Over the protests of consumer advocates, federal agencies have recently issued regulations preempting state predatory lending statutes as applied to national banks and <b>thrifts.</b> In addition, Congress is considering legislation that would preempt state predatory lending laws for all lenders. The article considers the preemption debate, particularly {{in the context of}} federally-supported lenders–banks, <b>thrifts,</b> and the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Banks and <b>thrifts</b> receive support through the federal safety net, which includes deposit insurance. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are federally chartered, privately-owned corporations that receive other types of federal support. The article concludes that preemption is not warranted for national banks and <b>thrifts</b> or for other lenders, and that banks, <b>thrifts,</b> and the GSEs {{should be part of the}} solution to the predatory lending problem by originating, purchasing, and/or securitizing subprime loans in compliance with state and federal law...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} regulatory regime changes on the attributes of acquired <b>thrifts</b> for periods of stringency in 1990 to 1993, and deregulation in 1994 to 2000, with the removal of significant impediments for bank takeovers of <b>thrifts.</b> We test a regime change hypothesis that predicts a more effective takeover market in the later regime. Consistent with the hypothesis, we find bank acquirers to engage in diverse motivations for takeovers in the later regime, including revenue turnaround motives, allowing discipline of profit inefficient firms. The results suggest greater takeover discipline in the later regime, but also suggest a complimentary role for regulatory discipline, with acquirers avoiding more cost inefficient and risky <b>thrifts.</b> In contrast in the early regime, regulatory concerns for building up capital dominate acquisition decisions.

40|$|Variation in IPO {{performance}} may {{be partially}} explained by differences in managerial control. In general, this characteristic has been ignored, {{perhaps because of}} the difficulty in testing its influence. The IPOs by mutual <b>thrifts</b> offer a laboratory in which the influence of managerial control can be assessed. Mutual <b>thrifts</b> can either issue all of their stock to investors (stockholder ownership) or can have the majority of the stock distributed to their respective mutual holding company (MHC). The MHC approach places the majority of shares with depositors, which essentially transfers voting power to the managers. Thus, managerial control is more pronounced because governance is limited. The average initial return of stockholder owned <b>thrifts</b> is substantially higher than the initial return of MHCs. This difference remains even after controlling for other factors. The significantly lower initial returns of MHCs are attributed to less uncertainty for MHCs, which allows for a lower degree of underpricing. The long-run performance of MHCs is not statistically different from that of stockholder owned <b>thrifts,</b> which could either suggest that MHCs attempt to maximize value, or that governance of the stockholder owned <b>thrifts</b> is ineffective. ...|$|R

5|$|Keynes {{contended that}} {{economic}} output is {{positively correlated with}} money velocity. He explained the relationship via changing liquidity preferences: people increase their money holdings during times of economic difficulty by reducing their spending, which further slows the economy. This paradox of <b>thrift</b> claimed that individual attempts to survive a downturn only worsen it. When the demand for money increases, money velocity slows. A slowdown in economic activities means markets might not clear, leaving excess goods to waste and capacity to idle. Turning the quantity theory on its head, Keynes argued that market changes shift quantities rather than prices. Keynes replaced the assumption of stable velocity with one of a fixed price-level. If spending falls and prices do not, the surplus of goods reduces the need for workers and increases unemployment.|$|E
5|$|Reid {{occupied}} high-ranking cabinet {{positions in}} Greenfield's government {{and that of}} his successor, John Edward Brownlee. Greenfield appointed him Minister of Health and Minister of Municipal Affairs in 1921. In the former capacity, he drew on his past experience with the Vermilion board in establishing new municipal health boards. He also proposed a program of eugenics through the sterilisation of the mentally handicapped, which in 1928 led to the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta. As an advocate of government-wide economy, he laid off all school inspection nurses and many public health nurses. This inclination towards <b>thrift</b> was also evident in his performance as Minister of Municipal Affairs, in which he resisted a 1926 call from several municipalities to transfer a greater proportion of the responsibility for caring for indigents to the province. In 1929, he disagreed with them again when he insisted that they be responsible for 10% of the old age pensions paid to their residents.|$|E

We also find that absent controls for lines of business pursued, stock institutions were both less efficient and more likely to fail than mutuals. With controls, these results are reversed. A consistent explanation is that stock institutions are better at resolving the standard agency conflict between owners and managers, but worse at resolving the "asset-substitution" conflict between shareholders and debtholders (depositors). Last, we find that some lines of business deregulated by the Garn-St. Germain Act adversely affected efficiency and solvency. ...|$|R

5|$|Dow {{struggled}} {{to conform to}} the tenets of his parents' Quaker faith; he was hot-tempered and enjoyed brawling from a young age. As he became wealthy later in life, he enjoyed wearing fine clothes, contrary to the Quakers' preference for plain dress. Some of his family's other virtues, such as <b>thrift</b> and abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, he adopted early in life. When he turned eighteen, Dow sought to avoid the required militia musters, more out of distaste for the drunkenness that they often involved than out of Quaker belief in pacifism. Instead, he joined the volunteer fire department, whose members were exempted from the muster. In 1827, Dow lobbied the Maine legislature to reform the fire companies to increase their efficiency. That same year, he argued against his fire company serving alcohol at its anniversary celebration; the members compromised, and served only wine, not hard liquor. At times Dow let his politics interfere with his duties; after being promoted to fire chief, he allowed a liquor store to burn to the ground.|$|E
