The greatest uncertainty concerns {{the size of}} the crack auxilia palatina infantry regiments, originally formed by Constantine. The evidence is contradictory, suggesting that these units could have been either c. 500 or c. 1,000 strong, or somewhere in between. If the higher figure were true, then <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> to distinguish auxilia from legiones, which is the strongest argument in favour of c. 500.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 20,000 tickets, {{out of a}} total capacity of 52,063. The remaining seats are accounted for by Hampden Park debenture holders, hospitality, sponsors, media and segregation areas. In excess of 1,000 unused debentures were distributed to each club. The allocation was enough to provide for the season ticket holders of each club, with Hearts having 10,000 and Hibs 7,500 approximately, although both clubs anticipated that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> or no need for a general public sale. Hearts decided to sell tickets using their loyalty points system, while Hibs connected their allocation to sales of season tickets and memberships. Due to high demand, Hearts tightened the criteria needed for a ticket during the sales process. Regular tickets cost £35 or £28 for adults and £10 for children under 15 years old.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not known}} why the first {{coalfield}} promoters chose this place for a coal port instead of the more obvious Dover.

Unfortunately, Krupp in Germany were already making steel cannon which could fire across the Channel by 1905, which ruled out any Royal Navy presence at Dover and made Richborough Port commercially rather pointless from the beginning.|$|E
25|$|Hauerwas finds {{these two}} moral {{theories}} very limiting {{because they are}} quandary ethics, cases that rely on extreme situations. He believes {{that there needs to}} be a third reasoning that falls somewhere in between these two. He believes that the basic doctor-patient relationship should be built on trust and caring. This characterizes him as more of deontological thinker; however, he does believe in research on human beings. Hauerwas’s perspective is {{that there needs to be}} a middle ground between these two perspectives. The patient becomes dehumanized through research; however, without this research <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> medical improvement. Hauerwas therefore believes this middle ground should focus on caring for the patient instead of curing. With this, Hauerwas believes we do not have the moral understanding to handle current medicine.|$|E

25|$|On December 10, 2004, the governor's office {{announced}} that the signature span concept had been scrapped, with the bridge to be the simple viaduct originally proposed. The design, having gone full circle, remained expensive due to the continued high cost of materials. Many argued that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> difference in final cost with this lesser proposal since that concept required obtaining new permits, perhaps adding another two or three years; furthermore, a viaduct {{may not even be}} able to obtain Coast Guard approval, since the maximum width of the ship channel would be reduced by almost half. Local reaction to this announcement was intense, with most suggesting that the bridge be built to appear as proposed— either in the steel material as bid or using a reinforced concrete tower of similar appearance but of lower cost.|$|E
25|$|As it was {{believed}} that in a colony of free settlers <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> crime, no provision was made for a gaol in Colonel Light's 1837 plan. However, by mid-1837 the South Australian Register was warning of escaped convicts from New South Wales and tenders for a temporary gaol were sought. Following a burglary, a murder, and two attempted murders in Adelaide during March 1838, Governor Hindmarsh created the South Australian Police Force (now named South Australia Police) in April 1838 under 21-year-old Henry Inman. The first sheriff, Mr Samuel Smart, was wounded during a robbery, and on 2 May 1838 one of the offenders, Michael Magee, became the first person to be hanged in South Australia. William Baker Ashton was appointed governor of the temporary gaol in 1839, and in 1840 George Strickland Kingston was commissioned to design Adelaide's new gaol. Construction of Adelaide Gaol commenced in 1841.|$|E
25|$|Many {{traditional}} feedstocks for biodiesel, such as {{corn and}} palm, {{are also used}} as feed for livestock on farms, {{as well as a}} valuable source of food for humans. Because of this, using them as biofuel reduces the amount of food available for both, resulting in an increased cost for both the food and the fuel produced. Using algae as a source of biodiesel can alleviate this problem in a number of ways. First, algae is not used as a primary food source for humans, meaning that it can be used solely for fuel and <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> impact in the food industry. Second, many of the waste-product extracts produced during the processing of algae for biofuel {{can be used as a}} sufficient animal feed. This is an effective way to minimize waste and a much cheaper alternative to the more traditional corn- or grain-based feeds.|$|E

25|$|The third Conservative {{budget was}} tabled on February 26, 2008. The {{government}} announced <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> to no new tax breaks as major tax cuts {{took place in}} the economic update during the fall of 2007 in anticipation of economic slowdowns in 2008. It was to be the last budget of the Conservative government's first term in office. Among the key announcements was {{the creation of a new}} $5000/year tax-free savings account (TFSA), funding for troubled manufacturing and forestry industries, a new Student Grant Program, higher defense spending, $500 million for transit and infrastructures and $400 million for hiring new police officers. The TFSA was touted as a badly needed addition to the Canadian tax system as it did not make sense for low income earners and seniors to make use of existing savings programs with tax incentives, such as RRSPs. In contrast, the TFSA could be used by such demographics to enjoy savings with tax benefits.|$|E
25|$|By early 1945 it {{was clear}} that the price {{controls}} which had been introduced to control inflation had only served to boost the black market and prices continued to move ever upwards. By this time the army had swelled to over 1.2 million men and almost half of state expenditure was going to military spending. De Gaulle was faced with his first major ministerial dispute when the very able but tough-minded economics minister Pierre Mendès France demanded a programme of severe monetary reform which was opposed by the Finance Ministry headed by Aime Lepercq, who favoured a programme of heavy borrowing to stimulate the economy. When de Gaulle, knowing <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> appetite for further austerity measures sided with Lepercq, Mendès France tendered his resignation, which was rejected because de Gaulle knew he needed him. Lepercq was killed in a road accident a short time afterwards and was succeeded by Pleven, but when in March, Mendès France asked unsuccessfully for taxes on capital earnings and for the blocking of certain bank accounts, he again offered his resignation and it was accepted.|$|E
25|$|Any type of pump {{that can}} deliver the {{required}} pressure difference and flow volume can be used. Most often used is the dynamic-compression centrifugal type compressor, which {{is familiar to}} most as being used in vacuum cleaners and turbochargers, but multistaged axial-flow compressor types, {{similar to those used}} in most jet engines, could work as well, although <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> need for the added cost and complexities involved, as they typically don't require such a high flow rate as a jet engine, nor are they limited by the aerodynamic drag considerations which makes a narrow-diameter axial compressor more effective in jet engines than a centrifugal compressor of equal air flow. Positive displacement types such as piston compressors, or rotary types such as a Roots blower could also be used with suitable provisions for damping the pulsations in the air flow (however, other rotary types such as twin screw compressors are capable of providing a steady supply of compressed fluid). The pressure ratio of a single fan blade is too low and cannot be used.|$|E

25|$|Operation Torch {{started on}} 8 November 1942, and {{finished}} on 11 November. In {{an attempt to}} pincer German and Italian forces, Allied forces (American and British Commonwealth), landed in Vichy-held French North Africa {{under the assumption that}} <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> to no resistance. Nevertheless, Vichy French forces put up a strong and bloody resistance to the Allies in Oran and Morocco, but not in Algiers, where a coup d'état by the French resistance on 8 November succeeded in neutralizing the French XIX Corps before the landing and arresting the Vichy commanders. Consequently, the landings met no practical opposition in Algiers, and the city was captured on the first day along with the entire Vichy African command. After three days of talks and threats, Generals Mark Clark and Dwight Eisenhower compelled the Vichy Admiral François Darlan (and General Alphonse Juin) to order the cessation of armed resistance in Oran and Morocco by French forces on 10–11 November with the provision that Darlan would be head of a Free French administration. During Operation Torch, American, Vichy French and German navy vessels fought the Naval Battle of Casablanca, ending in an American victory.|$|E
25|$|The {{failure to}} {{contemplate}} the possibility, that the troops at Y and S beaches might need to support the main landings, also exposed the failure to retain a reserve {{under the control of}} the Commander-in-Chief. Oglander speculated that had there been two battalions available, to land at the weakest point that the main landings had revealed in the Ottoman defences, Helles and Sedd el Bahr would have fallen by midday. Such a manoeuvre would have needed good communication between land and sea but the difficulty was underestimated and hampered British operations all day. The obvious difficulties of moving troops in open boats by instalments had been distracting, particularly the moments between disembarkation and reaching the shore, despite the confidence of the navy in its plans for bombardment. The apprehension was justified and the landing at V Beach was only saved from catastrophe by the covering fire of the machine-guns on River Clyde; defeat at W Beach was only averted by turning the Ottoman right flank. Lack of experience of opposed landings under modern conditions, made it difficult to rally scattered units and the challenge of organising an advancing inland was underestimated. It had been a mistake not to stress to all members of the landing force, that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> time to move inland before Ottoman reinforcements arrived.|$|E

Patton then gave Middleton the 89th Division and 76th Division for the river crossing. Middleton chose to cross the river near the Lorelei where the river was narrow, swift, and flanked by steep terrain, eliciting another laugh from Patton. Middleton knew <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> German resistance there, {{and he was able}} to get the entire 89th across in one night using inflatable rafts, and then put a pontoon bridge in place by early morning.

However, the focus would be upon Victor's death rather than the details of the accident. Renwick's decision to kill Victor in a road accident was fuelled by the writer's concerns about reckless driving. Also, the suddenness of an accident, as opposed to death by illness, would not negate the comic tone {{of the rest of the}} episode. The twist that the person responsible for Victor's death is Margaret's new best friend was designed to add some complexity to the show.|$|E
500|$|Major Phillip Mathews {{disagreed}} with the Board of Transportation's plan, and in response, he published a report, on December 24, 1926, titled [...] "Proposed Subway Plan for Subway Relief and Expansion." [...] He said that that congestion would not be addressed for Brooklyn and the Bronx; only the planned Grand Concourse line would alleviate congestion, in this case congestion on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line. Finally, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> relief on the two lines jointly-operated between the IRT and the BMT. He came up with his own plan. He proposed that the Eighth Avenue Line, through a connection from Fulton or Wall Streets to Chambers Street, {{be connected to the}} BMT's lines to Coney Island, with a possible connection at the Manhattan Bridge's south side. In Manhattan, he proposed a new four-track line running down Third Avenue from City Hall, with connections to the White Plains Road and Pelham Lines in the Bronx. The line would therefore have to be built to IRT clearances. At the line's southern end, a connection would be built to the Eastern Parkway Line near Franklin Avenue via a new set of tubes under the East River. To alleviate congestion on the Queens lines, a new trunk line would run from Eighth Avenue in Manhattan to Jamaica, with transfers to the north-south lines in Manhattan and to Brooklyn Crosstown service. This would later be built as the IND Queens Boulevard Line. To round out expansion in Manhattan, he proposed that an extension of the BMT Canarsie Line to Eighth Avenue. This was built at a later date. To connect the outer boroughs, a four-track Brooklyn-Queens crosstown line would be designed, with the possibility for future extensions into the Bronx and Staten Island.|$|E
