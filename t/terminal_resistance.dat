40|$|In {{order to}} improve the fault {{monitoring}} performance of grounding electrode lines in ultra-high voltage DC (UHVDC) transmission systems, a novel fault monitoring approach based on the high-frequency voltage standing-wave ratio (VSWR) is proposed in this paper.

40|$|A {{new method}} of microstimulation of the blowfly eye using corneal {{neutralization}} {{was applied to}} the 6 peripheral photoreceptor cells (R 1 -R 6) connected to one neuro-ommatidium (and thus looking into the same direction), whilst the receptor potential of a dark-adapted photoreceptor cell was recorded by means of an intracellular microelectrode. Stimulation of the photoreceptor cells not impaled elicited responses in the recorded cell of about 20 % of the response elicited when stimulating the recorded cell. This is probably caused by gap junctions recently found between the axon terminals of these cells. Stimulation of all 6 cells together yielded responses that were larger and longer than those obtained with stimulation of just the recorded cell, and intensity-response curves that deviated more strongly from linearity. Evidence is presented that the resistance of the axon terminal of the photoreceptor cells quickly drops in response to a light flash, depending on the light intensity. Incorporating the cable properties of the cell body and the axon, the resistance of the gap junctions, and the (adapting) <b>terminal</b> <b>resistance,</b> a theoretical model is presented that explains the measurements well. Finally, it is argued that the gap junctions between the photoreceptor cells may effectively uncouple the synaptic responses of the cells by counteracting the influence of field potentials. ...|$|E
30|$|In {{the current}} study, we tested a {{prototype}} of an isokinetic exercise device for the lower limbs. The proposed device involves a type of single-limb squat, which applies a translational load on the swing leg in the closed kinetic chain (CKC) style, placing load by the body weight on {{the muscles of the}} stance leg in the standing position. We refer to this training style as a resistive leg reach exercise [3]. This type of training applies load to the gluteal muscles, and is effective for preventing knee valgus moment, a major factor in ACL injuries. The primary goal of this style of training is to rehabilitate and/or preserve the ACL, and to provide a useful method for athletic strength training. To enhance the quality of the load used in this type of exercise, we have developed an electro-rheological isokinetic exercise device prototype, called the “ERIK” [4 – 6]. The ERIK includes an electro-rheological (ER) fluid brake system, which provides apparent viscosity that can be reversibly controlled by varying the applied voltage. In the current study, we tested the ERIK to verify its performance through reproducible experiments using a servomotor, in contrast with previous studies using only a basic control.

40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} {{calculations and}} photoemission spectroscopy measurements on the bulk Bi 2 Se 3 material {{show that it}} is a three-dimensional topological insulator possessing conductive surface states with nondegenerate spins, attractive for dissipationless electronics and spintronics applications. Nanoscale topological insulator materials have a large surface-to-volume ratio that can manifest the conductive surface states and are promising candidates for devices. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of high quality single crystalline Bi 2 Se 3 nanomaterials with a variety of morphologies. The synthesis of Bi 2 Se 3 nanowires and nanoribbons employs Au-catalyzed vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. Nanowires, which exhibit rough surfaces, are formed by stacking nanoplatelets along the axial direction of the wires. Nanoribbons are grown along [11 - 20] direction with a rectangular cross-section and have diverse morphologies, including quasi-one-dimensional, sheetlike, zigzag and sawtooth shapes. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies on nanoribbons show atomically smooth surfaces with ~ 1 nm step edges, indicating single Se-Bi-Se-Bi-Se quintuple layers. STM measurements reveal a honeycomb atomic lattice, suggesting that the STM tip couples not only to the top Se atomic layer, but also to the Bi atomic layer underneath, which opens up the possibility to investigate the contribution of different atomic orbitals to the topological surface states. Transport measurements of a single nanoribbon device (four <b>terminal</b> <b>resistance</b> and Hall resistance) show great promise for nanoribbons as candidates to study topological surface states.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a performance-based placement design method {{for the control}} of the earthquake responses of a multistory building using tuned electromagnetic inertial mass dampers (T-EIMDs). The T-EIMD consists of a ball screw mechanism, a gear, a flywheel, and an electric generator installed in a cylinder, and a spring element connected in series. The ball screw mechanism converts the axial oscillation of the rod end into the rotational motion of the internal flywheel and generates a large inertial force. The electric generator is turned by the rotation of the inner rod and generates a variable damping force that is controlled by the <b>terminal</b> <b>resistance.</b> The T-EIMDs are installed between adjacent floors of a building with steel chevron braces and function as large tuned mass dampers within the stories. The spring element has the function of tuning the natural period of the T-EIMD to the fundamental natural period of the building. In the present work, a design procedure for the story-wise placement of T-EIMDs is proposed to limit the peak story drift angles to a specified target value. The proposed procedure utilizes the expanded complete quadratic combination method that involves modal analysis with complex eigenvalue analysis and is able to determine the necessary story-wise distribution of inertial masses of the T-EIMDs in a building.

40|$|The pulse {{receiving}} {{characteristics of}} several thin-wire antennas {{have been investigated}} in this thesis. First, a loop antenna with a uniformly distributed impedance has been investigated, analytically, in the frequency domain. An equivalent circuit has been developed for the impedance-loaded loop antenna receiving an arbitrary steady-state electromagnetic field. The frequency- and time-domain receiving characteristics of a resistively loaded loop antenna have been obtained. It {{has been found that}} the loop antenna with a uniform distributed resistance has a broad receiving bandwidth. Nonetheless, the antenna is dispersive and is therefore not suitable for the reception of electromagnetic pulses or transients. Second, pulse-receiving characteristics of resistively loaded straight dipole antennas have been investigated in the time domain. Frequency-domain receiving characteristics have been obtained using the Fast Fourier Transform method. Two types of resistively loaded straight dipole antenna designs have been considered. One design has a high distributed resistance and a low <b>terminal</b> <b>resistance,</b> and gives a broad bandwidth {{at the expense of the}} sensitivity. The other design has a low distributed resistance and a high <b>terminal</b> <b>resistance.</b> It does not sacrifice the sensitivity but requires an active high-impedance receiver circuit. It has been found that the Wu-King resistively loaded dipole has the maximally flat frequency response close to the upper roll-off frequency, when terminated with a high-impedance load. Third, a time-domain stepping-in-time procedure has been developed for the analysis of unloaded and resistively loaded V-antennas. V-antennas with various terminations have also been analyzed using the Numerical Electromagnetic Code. After identifying the limitations of resistively loaded straight and V-antennas in receiving fast pulses and transients, a passive compensation technique has been developed to significantly increase the upper frequency limit of the V-antenna. The new V-antenna consists of a resistively-loaded thin-wire V-dipole or monopole, a Response Equalizer Circuit and an oscilloscope probe (or other termination). For a given termination, the new antenna has a higher sensitivity and a much broader bandwidth compared with the Wu-King antenna. It is estimated to have a 3 -dB bandwidth from 25 MHz to 10 GHz when used with a commercially available 500 Ω passive probe. The sensitivity is approximately 1 mV/(Vm- 1), taking into account the 20 dB attenuation of the probe. With a 50 Ω probe, this antenna has a 3 -dB bandwidth from 110 MHz to 10 GHz, and a sensitivity better than 4 mV/(Vm- 1). A V-antenna and a Wu-King monopole antenna have been fabricated using thin-film deposition technology. A time-domain antenna range has been built and used to measure the time-domain response of the experimental antennas. It has been found that the experimental V-antenna is capable of receiving a 520 -ps approximately Gaussian pulse, without significant distortions. The frequency-domain receiving characteristics of the two antennas have been obtained using the Fast Fourier Transform method. The receiving response of the V-antenna has been measured in the frequency domain, using a TEM cell and network analyzers. The experimental thin-film V-antenna has a sensitivity of 1. 12 mV/(Vm- 1) and a flat receiving response from 35 MHz to 3 GHz. It was not possible to measure the response beyond 3 GHz, due to limitations of the pulse generators available. The experimental thin-film Wu-King antenna has a sensitivity of 22 mV/(Vm- 1) and an upper roll-off frequency of about 300 MHz, which is limited by the bandwidth of the active receiver circuit...|$|E

Prior to Superpave, the Indiana Department of Transportation aggregate frictional requirements {{were based on}} average daily traffic volumes and were divided into low, medium, and high volume categories. With the implementation of Superpave in Indiana, aggregate frictional requirements were reassigned to categories based on equivalent single axle load values. The purpose of the research is to determine whether average daily traffic or equivalent single axle load has a greater effect on the frictional resistance of a hot-mix asphalt pavement, to confirm and update, if necessary, the current equivalent single axle load based breakpoints for aggregate frictional requirements, and to evaluate the effects of aggregate physical properties on frictional resistance. Statistical analyses were conducted on inventory skid data to observe the effects of average daily traffic and equivalent single axle loads. It was determined that average daily traffic may have a greater effect on frictional resistance than equivalent single axle load. Additional statistical {{analyses were conducted to}} verify categorical breakpoints which indicated that the former average daily traffic breakpoints are correct and that the upper bound equivalent single axle load breakpoint may need some modification. Aggregates were tested for acid insolubility, differential wear, and frictional resistance. Acid insolubility results and physical property data obtained from quality assurance files were correlated to aggregate frictional resistance. Collected quality assurance data included bulk specific gravity, percent absorption, percent loss from impact, and percent loss from brine freeze/thaw. It was observed that the aggregates used in this study had a negligible amount of insoluble material and therefore had an insignificant effect on the frictional <b>resistance.</b> <b>Terminal</b> frictional <b>resistance</b> increased with decreasing bulk specific gravity, and increased with increasing percent absorption and percent loss from impact.
