5|$|On September 5, {{the mayor}} of Hickman, Kentucky, a small western town along the Mississippi River, telegraphed {{the state board of}} health, informing them that yellow fever had reached {{epidemic}} levels in the city and requesting that Blackburn be sent to them as soon as possible. Blackburn arrived on September 7 to find that roughly 20 percent of the town's population were ill with yellow fever. He organized cleanup crews <b>to</b> <b>disinfect</b> the town and a squad of Negroes to guard vacated homes. In late September, when it appeared the Hickman epidemic was waning, Blackburn traveled to Chattanooga and Martin, Tennessee, to render aid, but within ten days, he received word that the outbreak in Hickman had resurged and spread to nearby Fulton, Kentucky. Blackburn returned to the area and continued his ministrations until late October, when the outbreak had fully subsided.|$|E
5|$|Photochromic lenses include silver halides, so that {{ultraviolet}} light in natural daylight liberates metallic silver, darkening the lenses. The silver halides are reformed in lower light intensities. Colourless silver chloride films {{are used in}} radiation detectors. Zeolite sieves incorporating Ag+ ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues, using silver ions to precipitate chloride as silver chloride. Silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation, but the application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption. Colloidal silver is similarly used <b>to</b> <b>disinfect</b> closed swimming pools; while it {{has the advantage of}} not giving off a smell like hypochlorite treatments do, colloidal silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools. Small silver iodide crystals are used in cloud seeding to cause rain.|$|E
5|$|The floodwaters {{from the}} {{hurricane}} combined with raw sewage in many poor areas of southwestern Mexico, {{leading to a}} widespread threat for a spread of tropical diseases. As a result, government health workers opened vaccination centers in several cities along the Guerrero and Oaxaca coasts. Thousands were inoculated for typhoid fever and tetanus. Officials noted a potential threat for dengue and cholera {{as a result of}} the spoiled water. Health workers also stated mosquitos possessing malaria and dengue fever were likely to breed in large areas of leftover water. In Acapulco, about two days after the hurricane passed, the first day of sun in a week evaporated the areas of leftover water, spreading dust across the region with the deadly diseases. Residents were warned to boil their food and water for 30minutes due to the threat for contamination by the dust. At least twenty cases of cholera and at least six cases of dengue fever were reported. Most significantly, there were 14,630cases of malaria in 616villages in Oaxaca due to Pauline; this represented about 80% of the malaria cases in Mexico during 1998. Army soldiers distributed chlorine tablets <b>to</b> <b>disinfect</b> water pools and wheelbarrows to remove rotting mud and sewage from their damaged homes. Two C-130 Hercules planes and twenty helicopters airlifted food and water to smaller villages south of Acapulco that were stranded for nearly a week after the hurricane.|$|E

25|$|Common {{hospital}} disinfectants are ineffective against C. difficile spores and, in fact, may promote spore formation, however, disinfectants {{containing a}} 10:1 ratio {{of water to}} bleach effectively kill the spores. Hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) systems used to sterilize a patient room post-discharge {{have been shown to}} reduce infection rates and to reduce risk of infection to subsequent patients. The incidence of CDI was reduced by 53% or 42% through use of HPV. Ultraviolet cleaning devices and housekeeping staff especially dedicated <b>to</b> <b>disinfecting</b> the rooms of patients infected with C. difficile after discharge may be effective.|$|R

40|$|The chronic {{exposure}} of {{large segments of}} the population <b>to</b> <b>disinfected</b> drinking water has necessitated an evaluation of the health effects of the by-products of the chlorination process. This paper reviews the available information concerning the reproductive consequences associated with exposure to disinfection by-products. Four groups of compounds are discussed: the trihalomethanes, in particular chloroform; the chlorinated phenols; chlorinated humic substances; and the haloacetonitriles. In the pregnant female, chloroform and the 2 - and 2, 4 -chlorophenols produced low levels of embryo- and fetotoxicity. Chloroform induced terata when administered by inhalation. The chlorinated humic substances and 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol were without significant reproductive effects. The haloacetonitriles showed in utero toxicity, becoming more severe with increasing halogen substitution...|$|R

25|$|Officials from Maple Leaf {{believe that}} the {{outbreak}} originated sometime in July on line 8 or line 9 of the North York facility. Regardless, the entire plant has undergone intense sanitation, which began August 21. About 80 workers {{were involved in the}} cleanup, with additional outside experts and microbiologists supervising the operation. They used peroxyacetic acid, quaternary ammonium compound, isopropyl alcohol, refrigeration gel and a granular compound <b>to</b> <b>disinfect</b> the parts of the apparatuses. About 600 employees were to attend a four-hour training session on Listeria and on cleanliness, and about 250 employees were laid off while the plant was being cleaned.|$|E
25|$|Three Buccaneers players — kicker Lawrence Tynes, guard Carl Nicks and cornerback Johnthan Banks — were {{diagnosed}} with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections during the season.

25|$|Prevention is {{the only}} way to ensure that a puppy or dog remain healthy because the disease is {{extremely}} virulent and contagious. Appropriate vaccination should be performed starting at 7–8 weeks of age, with a booster given every 3–4 weeks until at least 16 weeks of age. Likewise, pregnant mothers should not be vaccinated as it will abort the puppies and could make the mother extremely sick. The virus is extremely hardy and has been found to survive in feces and other organic material such as soil for over 10 years. It survives extremely low and high temperatures. The only household disinfectant that kills the virus is bleach. The dilute bleach solution needs to be a (1:10 ratio) <b>to</b> <b>disinfect</b> and kill parvovirus.|$|E

25|$|Silver nitrate is {{currently}} unregulated in water sources by the Environmental Protection Agency. However, {{if more than}} 1 gram of silver is accumulated in the body, a condition called argyria may develop. Argyria is a permanent cosmetic condition in which the skin and internal organs turn a blue-gray color. The United States Environmental Protection Agency {{used to have a}} maximum contaminant limit for silver in water until 1990, when it was determined that argyria did not impact the function of any affected organs. Argyria is more often associated with the consumption of colloidal silver solutions rather than with silver nitrate, since it is only used at extremely low concentrations <b>to</b> <b>disinfect</b> the water. However, it is still important to be wary before ingesting any sort of silver-ion solution.|$|E
500|$|During the Paris cholera {{outbreak}} of 1832, {{large quantities of}} so-called chloride of lime were used <b>to</b> <b>disinfect</b> the capital. This was not simply modern calcium chloride, but chlorine gas dissolved in lime-water (dilute calcium hydroxide) to form calcium hypochlorite (chlorinated lime). Labarraque's discovery helped to remove the terrible stench of decay from hospitals and dissecting rooms, and by doing so, effectively deodorised the Latin Quarter of Paris. These [...] "putrid miasmas" [...] were thought by many to cause the spread of [...] "contagion" [...] and [...] "infection" [...] – both words used before the germ theory of infection. Chloride of lime was used for destroying odors and [...] "putrid matter". One source claims chloride of lime was used by Dr. John Snow <b>to</b> <b>disinfect</b> water from the cholera-contaminated well that was feeding the Broad Street pump in 1854 London, though three other reputable sources that describe that famous cholera epidemic do not mention the incident. One reference {{makes it clear that}} chloride of lime was used <b>to</b> <b>disinfect</b> the offal and filth in the streets surrounding the Broad Street pump—a common practice in mid-nineteenth century England.|$|E
500|$|Deutsche Gold- und Silber-Scheideanstalt (German Gold and Silver Refinery; Degussa) became sole {{owners of}} Degesch in 1922.
