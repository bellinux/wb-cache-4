5|$|In {{response}} to the growing cardistry community, Dan and Dave organized the first cardistry convention and interactive conference to promote the performance art in 2014, called Cardistry-Con. The convention saw interviews, panel discussions, live performances, exclusive video screenings, workshops, contests and giveaways. The 2015 convention was attended by journalists from magazines such as Vanity Fair and Wired as well as television stations, all of which helped further popularize cardistry as an art. Its growth {{has been associated with}} its availability with the availability of videos, lessons and podcasts, which <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the art more transparent and available to all who are interested.|$|E
5|$|Carrot soup can be {{prepared}} as a cream-style soup and as a broth-style soup. Vegetable stock or chicken stock {{can be used as}} ingredients in both styles of soup. Other vegetables may be used in the dish, including root vegetables, the latter of which may include garlic onion, shallot, potato, turnip and others. Carrot juice and orange juice can be used in its preparation, and some versions are prepared using puréed carrot. After cooking, the dish can be run through a sieve to strain it. The carrots used can be peeled or unpeeled, and the use of peeled carrots can lend to increased smoothness in puréed versions of the dish. Those prepared with puréed carrot may have a thick consistency while also being smooth in texture. The soup's color can vary based upon the coloration of the carrots used. Young carrots <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the soup sweeter and imbue it with a bright orange coloration, while older, larger carrots provide less sweetness and may imbue a yellow coloration. The use of old, cracked carrots that have a woody texture in their interior can produce a soup of inferior quality.|$|E
5|$|What makes Yoshi's Island DS {{different}} is {{the addition of}} five babies for Yoshi to carry, each bestowing a different ability — Baby Mario allows Yoshi to dash and makes special 'M' blocks appear, and can grab Super Stars to become Super Baby Mario, and grants ricocheting eggs; Baby Peach allows Yoshi to float and fly on wind currents and grants a more forgiving timing to use Yoshi's flutter jumping abilities effectively; Baby Donkey Kong can grab and swing on vines and ropes, grants a special dash attack, allows Yoshi's eggs to explode as per Yoshi's Story (but they do so on impact) and allows Yoshi to push objects faster; Baby Wario uses his magnet to attract metal objects and allows Yoshi's eggs to bounce; and Baby Bowser spits fireballs, but the Yoshi carrying him cannot make eggs, though the eggs Yoshi already carries can bounce. The last three babies <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the timing for Yoshi's flutter jumping less forgiving and slow down his movement a little bit. The need to switch babies at key points adds a puzzle element to the game.|$|E
5000|$|Of Homeostatic Gaia, Kirchner {{recognised}} two alternatives.

[...] "Strong Gaia" [...] according to Kirchner, asserted that life <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the environment stable, {{to enable the}} flourishing of all life. Strong Gaia, Kirchner claimed, was untestable and therefore not scientific.|$|R

5|$|Similarly, modern {{equipment}} {{was developed to}} reduce injuries. The football helmet, although a scapegoat for concussions, serves as effective protection against more dangerous injuries like skull fractures. The modern helmet traces its roots back to the leather helmets used by football players in the early 1900s {{to protect themselves from}} head injuries. Helmets later evolved to be made of hard plastic, and a facemask was added to protect players from sustaining facial injuries. Many players also wear mouthguards to prevent injuries to their teeth and tongues; at some levels, such as the NCAA, the use of a mouthguard is mandatory. Football players wear a number of pads to protect themselves – shoulder pads are the most important pads, protecting the shoulder and sternum, but thigh pads, hip pads, tail pads, and knee pads are also used. Many quarterbacks wear flak jackets to protect their ribcage. Cleats come in a number of lengths, with players choosing which cleat to use based on the playing field – on artificial turf, for example, players prefer a shorter cleat to prevent their feet from digging into the ground and risking injury, while longer cleats are generally used on fields that are wet or slippery to provide better traction. Athletic cups are not typically used at the professional level, because athletic cups <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it harder to move and there is an unwritten code among players not to target the groin area. Additionally, studies have shown that proper conditioning techniques, fitness routines and exercise routines, as well as high-quality equipment and coaching, can reduce the risk of injury among players.|$|E

25|$|Agreeableness is {{negatively}} correlated with income, although agreeable people can be less disruptive in teams {{and are more likely}} to be liked, although not necessarily respected, by their coworkers.

25|$|Tools for code {{analysis}} help developers by {{inspecting the}} program text beyond the compiler's capabilities to spot potential problems.

However, microbial species and communities capable of degrading plastics are discovered from time to time, and some show promise as being useful for bioremediating certain classes of plastic waste.|$|E

25|$|It is not {{realistic}} for the Court {{to assume that}} there are unlimited funds {{to address the needs}} of all.

25|$|Divide-and-conquer {{algorithms}} naturally <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{efficient use}} of memory caches. The reason is that once a sub-problem is small enough, it and all its sub-problems can, in principle, be solved within the cache, without accessing the slower main memory. An algorithm designed to exploit the cache {{in this way is}} called cache-oblivious, because it does not contain the cache size as an explicit parameter.|$|E

25|$|Crystal {{structure}} data in CIF format {{are linked}} to scientific articles as supplementary material. CIFs may be accessible directly from the publisher’s website, crystallographic databases, or both. In recent years, many publishers of crystallographic journals have come to interpret CIFs as formatted versions of open data, i.e. representing non-copyrightable facts, and therefore <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them freely available online, independent of the accessibility status of linked scientific articles.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, ornate flying snakes {{have become}} {{increasingly}} available in the exotic pet trade; many are exported from Vietnam and neighboring countries.

In one such study, conventional energy mix in Greece was compared to multi-si PV and found a 95% overall reduction in impacts including carcinogens, eco-toxicity, acidification, eutrophication, and eleven others.|$|E
25|$|A cruiser bicycle, {{also known}} as a beach cruiser or (formerly) motobike, is a bicycle that usually {{combines}} balloon tires, an upright seating posture, a single-speed drivetrain, and straightforward steel construction with expressive styling. Cruisers are popular among casual bicyclists and vacationers because they are very stable and easy to ride, but their heavy weight and balloon tires <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them rather slow. They are designed for use primarily on paved roads, moderate speeds/distances, and are included in the non-racing/non-touring class and heavyweight or middleweight styles of the road bicycle type.|$|E

Only the montane species <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> long distance flights. Shorter flights tend to be direct and swift, but longer flights are slightly undulating. Their flight can be surprisingly silent (for observers), although that of a few species is reportedly quite noisy.|$|E
