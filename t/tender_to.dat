5|$|An unusual {{fault with}} the first engines of the class was fore-and-aft vibration, strong enough to prompt {{passengers}} to complain and to cause fire-irons stowed in a longitudinal compartment {{on top of the}} <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> work their way forward into the cab. The passengers' complaints were dealt with by reducing the tension in the drawbar spring.|$|E
5|$|HMS Gorgon was {{the first}} ship {{completed}} and she served as <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> HMS Cambridge, the gunnery school ship at Devonport, from 1874 to 1877. All four ships were commissioned between April and August 1878 during the war scare during the Russo-Turkish War for service with Admiral Sir Cooper Key's Particular Service Squadron in Portland Harbour. She resumed her duties as <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> HMS Cambridge until she was refitted in 1888–89. All four of the ships of the class participated in the annual fleet manoeuvers in 1887, 1889–90 and 1892; in between times they were in Fleet Reserve. HMS Gorgon, like all of her sisters, {{was placed on the}} non-effective list in 1901 and sold in 1903 for £8,400.|$|E

5|$|By 1883, most coins on {{the islands}} were American, due to the close {{economic}} integration between islands and mainland. The laws of Hawaii reflected this, making gold American coins legal tender for an unlimited amount and American silver coins legal <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> $50. In 1879, the kingdom issued its first currency notes, technically certificates of deposit, redeemable in silver coin and with denominations ranging from $10 to $500.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, British Land {{announced}} that it had won the <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> demolish and rebuild the station, spending some £250m of its overall redevelopment budget of £1bn for the area. The number of platforms would increase from 18 to 21. In 2008, {{it was reported that}} the Arch could be rebuilt. In September 2011, the demolition plans were cancelled, and Aedas was appointed to give the station a makeover.|$|E
5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} is an {{inflammation of}} the prepatellar bursa {{at the front of}} the knee. It is marked by swelling at the knee, which can be <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> the touch but which does not restrict the knee's range of motion. It is most commonly caused by trauma to the knee, either by a single acute instance or by chronic trauma over time. As such, prepatellar bursitis commonly occurs among individuals whose professions require frequent kneeling.|$|E

5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament becomes inflamed {{and there}} may be pain when biting or tapping on the tooth. On an X-ray, bone resporption appears as a radiolucent area around the end of the root, although this does not manifest immediately. Acute apical periodontitis is characterized by well-localized, spontaneous, persistent, moderate to severe pain. The alveolar process may be <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> palpation over the roots. The tooth may be raised in the socket and feel more prominent than the adjacent teeth.|$|E
5|$|Whilst nearly {{fifteen of}} the tenders {{remained}} wedded {{to their original}} locomotives, others received new partners - the very first <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> be manufactured swapped partners seven times. After the Second World War, when the streamlined tenders were de-streamlined, {{it was difficult to}} spot any mismatches. The most readily visible mismatches were those of locomotives Nos. 6249–6252 where pre-produced Type 'A' streamlined tenders were married to unstreamlined locomotives.|$|E
5|$|A large repair {{was carried}} out at Plymouth Dock (i.e. Devonport) for the sum of £78,909 between March 1814 and March 1816, but {{with the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars she was laid up for a number of years. Canopus was fitted for sea at Devonport in May 1834, and {{underwent}} further repairs between December 1839 and May 1842. She was prepared for sea again in early 1845, spending time under the command of Fairfax Moresby, before being laid up at Devonport in 1848. She was fitted out there as a receiving ship between June and October 1862, and served as a <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> , the Devonport guardship. Canopus became a mooring hulk in 1869, with her masts being removed in April 1878. She was finally sold after 89 years service with the Royal Navy in October 1887 to J. Pethick, and was broken up.|$|E
50|$|The Type XC1 entered {{service as}} <b>tenders</b> <b>to</b> these locomotives. More entered service in 1898, as <b>tenders</b> <b>to</b> the Oranje-Vrijstaat Gouwerment-Spoorwegen (OVGS) 6th Class L3, Class 6E on the SAR. These two Classes were built by Dübs and Company, Neilson and Company, Neilson, Reid and Company and Sharp, Stewart and Company.|$|R
50|$|Type JT tenders {{first entered}} service in 1935 as <b>tenders</b> <b>to</b> the Class 15E 4-8-2 Mountain and Class 16E 4-6-2 Pacific steam {{locomotives}} which {{were placed in}} service by the South African Railways in that year.

5|$|Arriving {{back home}} in early 1890, Calliope was placed in reserve and {{remained}} there {{for the next seven}} years. In June 1897 the cruiser was present at Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee Review of the Fleet at Spithead. That same year Calliope became a <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> , an older and larger armoured cruiser used as seagoing training ship for boys. Calliope also was occasionally used as a training cruiser, and toured the Mediterranean from February to April in 1900, and again in March 1901, and March 1902. During the summer 1902 she undertook a training cruise in home waters May–June 1902 under the command of Captain E. D. St. A. Ommanney, visiting Campbeltown, Belfast Lough, Portishead, Dartmouth, Lyme Regis and Guernsey; before taking part in the Coronation Naval Review.|$|E
5|$|In January 1919, Collingwood was {{transferred}} to Devonport and assigned to the Reserve Fleet. Upon {{the dissolution of the}} Grand Fleet on 18 March, the Reserve Fleet was redesignated the Third Fleet and Collingwood became its flagship. She became a <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> HMS Vivid on 1 October and served as a gunnery and wireless telegraphy (W/T) training ship. The W/T school {{was transferred}} to Glorious on 1 June 1920 and the gunnery duties followed in early August; Collingwood returned to the reserve. She became a boys' training ship on 22 September 1921 until she was paid off on 31 March 1922. Collingwood was sold to John Cashmore Ltd for scrap on 12 December and arrived at Newport, Wales, on 3 March 1923 to be broken up.|$|E

5|$|Locomotive tenders {{were also}} changed as new, {{improved}} designs became available. Some {{examples of the}} second batch (70025–70029) were equipped with the BR1A tender, which had a higher water capacity of 5,000 gallons. Members of the third batch (70045–70054) were equipped with another tender design, the BR1D, which had 9 tons of coal and 4,750 gallons of water, {{due to the fact}} that they were intended for use on longer runs in the north of the railway network. This tender design also featured a steam-powered coal pusher, which eliminated the need for crew members to mount the <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> pull forward coal when the locomotive was at a stop.|$|E
5|$|On 21 December 1918, Benham put to sea from Brest for {{the last}} time and began the voyage back to the United States. Rejoining the Atlantic Fleet at the {{beginning}} of 1919, the warship participated in the annual fleet maneuvers held in Cuban waters and then made a cruise to the Azores in May. Upon her return to the United States that summer, she was placed in ordinary at Norfolk on 28 June. Active again in 1921, she patrolled the eastern seaboard until assigned duty as plane guard and <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> the Atlantic Fleet Air Squadrons. That duty terminated in May 1922, and she stood into Philadelphia on 12 May to prepare for inactivation.|$|E
5|$|Renown briefly {{served as}} a <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> HMS Victory in October before her refit was {{completed}} in November. During the Coronation Review at Spithead on 24 June 1911 for King George V, the ship {{was used as an}} accommodation ship. She was slightly damaged when water tanker Aid rammed her on 26 November 1911. Renown was offered for sale on 31 January 1913 and partially dismantled. In December 1913, she was moored at the Motherbank, awaiting disposal. On 1 April 1914 she was sold at auction to Hughes Bolckow for scrap at a price of £39,000. She was broken up at Blyth.|$|E

5|$|She {{was sent}} to Portsmouth {{after the end of}} the war where she was made {{available}} to investigate the cause of her sister ship Glattons magazine explosion. She was moved to Devonport as a temporary <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> the stone frigate Vivid in April 1919. She was paid off on 31 August and joined the Reserve Fleet in September. She was offered back to the Norwegians, but they rejected her as unsuitable to their requirements, especially since she was now too broad for their dock at Horten. Several attempts were made to sell her, but she was disarmed in 1922 and used as a target ship to evaluate the effects of bombs bursting underwater near a ship and the effects of six-inch gunfire. She was finally sold for scrap on 26 August 1928 and broken up at the former naval dockyard at Pembroke.|$|E
5|$|The Southern removed {{everything}} they could use elsewhere, and by 8 November, had lifted the track from Lynton to milepost 15⅓ - on the Barnstaple side of Woody Bay station. On 13 November an auction was held, although the railway failed to attract much interest. Most rolling stock, and every loco except for Lew, was scrapped at Pilton. Some coaches were sectioned for use as garden sheds. Third class seats became garden furniture, and first class seats {{found their way into}} local snooker halls and Masonic lodges. In December, Plymouth ship breaker Sidney Castle won the <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> dismantle the railway. The remaining track was lifted by June 1936, and in September, surviving loco Lew was shipped to Brazil. The stations and track bed were auctioned in 1938.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{remained}} in the Austro-Hungarian fleet for the next twenty years, but severely reduced naval budgets owing to Hungarian disinterest in naval matters led to an uneventful career. In 1870, Habsburg was used {{in a show of}} force to try to prevent the Italian annexation of Rome while the city's protector, France, was distracted with the Franco-Prussian War, though the Italians took the city regardless. They were rearmed with newer guns in 1874 and again in 1882. Both ships were converted for secondary duties in 1886, Erzherzog Ferdinand Max becoming a <b>tender</b> <b>to</b> the gunnery training school from 1889 to 1908, while Habsburg was employed as a guard ship and a barracks ship in Pola until 1898, when she was stricken from the naval register and sold for scrap.
