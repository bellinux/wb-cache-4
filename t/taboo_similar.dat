50|$|Armenian Woman's Sign Language, {{also known}} as Caucasian Sign Language, is an {{indigenous}} sign language of Armenia. It is {{not directly related to}} the sign languages of Europe, though it may have historical connections to monastic sign language. It developed under marriage speech <b>taboos</b> <b>similar</b> to those operating in Aboriginal Australia (see Australian Aboriginal sign languages), and is now defunct. The deaf community now has its own sign language, Armenian Sign Language.|$|R
5000|$|Prohibitions and <b>taboos</b> <b>similar</b> to geasa {{are also}} found in more recent English literature, though they are not {{described}} as geasa in those texts. For example, in William Shakespeare's play Macbeth, the title character believes he is safe because [...] "no man of woman born shall harm Macbeth". However, his nemesis Macduff was [...] "from his mother's womb untimely ripp'd" [...] (i.e., born by Caesarean section), and was therefore not [...] "of woman born".|$|R
50|$|Some ethnic Chinese {{may also}} refrain from eating cow meat, {{because many of}} them {{feel that it is}} wrong to eat an animal that was so useful in agriculture. Some Chinese Buddhists {{discourage}} the consumption of beef, although it is not considered <b>taboo.</b> A <b>similar</b> <b>taboo</b> can be seen among Sinhalese Buddhists, who consider it to be ungrateful to kill the animal whose milk and labour provides livelihoods to many Sinhalese people.|$|R
50|$|<b>Similar</b> <b>taboos</b> can {{be found}} {{as far north as}} Shetland. Other sea taboos {{included}} pigs, cats, and knives. There is a comparable and apparently also relatively modern taboo against uttering the word 'rabbit' on the Isle of Portland.|$|R

"Well, that's {{all very}} {{interesting}} to me," [...] the Alien went on with a charming smile, that disarmed her indignation; [...] "for I've come here on purpose to collect facts and notes about English <b>taboos</b> and <b>similar</b> observances. I'm Secretary of a Nomological Society at home, which is interested in pagodas, topes, and joss-houses; and I've been travelling in Africa and in the South Sea Islands {{for a long time}} past, working at materials for a History of Taboo, from its earliest beginnings in the savage stage to its fully developed European complexity; so of course all you say comes home to me greatly. Your taboos, I foresee, will prove a most valuable and illustrative study." ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a continuous-time Markov chain with a finite or countable state space. For a site y and subset H {{of the state}} space, the hitting time of y under taboo H is defined to be infinite if the process trajectory hits H before y, and the first hitting time of y otherwise. We investigate the probability that such times are finite. In particular, if the taboo set is finite, an efficient iterative scheme reduces the study to the known case of a singleton <b>taboo.</b> A <b>similar</b> procedure applies {{in the case of}} finite complement of the taboo set. The study is motivated by classification of branching processes with finitely many catalysts. Keywords and phrases: Markov chain, hitting time, taboo probabilities, catalytic branching process...|$|R
60|$|M. Dozon, who has {{collected}} the Bulgarian songs, {{says that this}} custom of prolonged silence {{on the part of}} the bride is very common in Bulgaria, though it is beginning to yield to a sense of the ludicrous. {74a} In Sparta and in Crete, as is well known, the bridegroom was long the victim of a somewhat <b>similar</b> <b>taboo,</b> and was only permitted to seek the company of his wife secretly, and in the dark, like the Iroquois described by Lafitau.|$|R
50|$|A {{guessing}} {{game has}} as its core a piece of information that one player knows, and {{the object is to}} coerce others into guessing that piece of information without actually divulging it in text or spoken word. Charades is probably the most well-known game of this type, and has spawned numerous commercial variants that involve differing rules on the type of communication to be given, such as Catch Phrase, <b>Taboo,</b> Pictionary, and <b>similar.</b> The genre also includes many game shows such as Win, Lose or Draw, Password and $25,000 Pyramid.|$|R
50|$|Taboos begin {{when the}} first-born son reaches {{the age of}} five or six. From this time on the son may not eat from the same dish as his father, wear his father's cap or tunic, carry his father's quiver, use his father's bow, or look into his father's granary. When the son reaches adolescence, he may not meet his father in the {{entrance}} to the house compound. <b>Similar</b> <b>taboos</b> exist to regulate the relationship between mother and first-born daughter. The daughter, for example, may not look into her mother's storage pot.|$|R
50|$|The Kinsey Reports, which {{together}} sold {{three-quarters of a}} million copies and were translated in thirteen languages, may be considered {{as part of the}} most successful and influential scientific books of the 20th century. The Kinsey Reports are associated with a change in public perception of sexuality. In the 1960s, following the introduction of the first oral contraceptive, this change was to be expressed in the sexual revolution. Also in the 1960s, Masters and Johnson published their investigations into the physiology of sex, breaking <b>taboos</b> and misapprehensions <b>similar</b> to those Kinsey had broken more than a decade earlier in a closely related field.|$|R

50|$|A {{guessing}} {{game is a}} game {{in which}} the object is to use guessing to discover some kind of information, such as a word, a phrase, a title, or the identity or location of an object.

6000|$|... "And I mean it in {{the very}} {{simplest}} and most literal sense," [...] Bertram went on quite seriously. [...] "I'd been among you some time before it began to dawn on me that you English didn't regard your own taboos as essentially identical with other people's. To me, from the very first, they seemed absolutely {{the same as the}} <b>similar</b> <b>taboos</b> of Central Africans and South Sea Islanders. All of them spring alike from a common origin, the queer savage belief that various harmless or actually beneficial things may become at times in some mysterious way harmful and dangerous. The essence of them all lies in the erroneous idea that if certain contingencies occur, such as breaking an image or deserting a faith, some terrible evil will follow to one man or to the world, which evil, as a matter of fact, there's no reason at all to dread in any way. Sometimes, as in ancient Rome, Egypt, Central Africa, and England, the whole of life gets enveloped at last in a perfect mist and labyrinth of taboos, a cobweb of conventions. The Flamen Dialis at Rome, you know, mightn't ride or even touch a horse; he mightn't see an army under arms; nor wear a ring that wasn't broken; nor have a knot in any part of his clothing. He mightn't eat wheaten flour or leavened bread; he mightn't look at or even mention by name such unlucky things as a goat, a dog, raw meat, haricot beans, or common ivy. He mightn't walk under a vine; the feet of his bed had to be daubed with mud; his hair could only be cut by a free man, and with a bronze knife; he was encased and surrounded, as it were, by endless petty restrictions and regulations and taboos--just like those that now surround so many men, and especially so many young women, here in England." ...|$|R
