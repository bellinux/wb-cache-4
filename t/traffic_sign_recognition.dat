40|$|Considering {{the problem}} of {{automatic}} <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> <b>recognition</b> in natural scene image (mainly including three kinds of traffic signs: yellow warning signs, red prohibition signs and blue mandatory signs), a new method for <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> <b>recognition</b> based on central projection transformation is proposed in this paper. In this method, self-adaptive image segmentation is firstly used to extract binary inner images of detected <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> after they are detected from natural scene images. Secondly, one-dimensional feature vectors of inner images are computed by central projection transformation. Lastly, these vectors are input to the trained probabilistic neural networks (PNN) for exact classification, the output of PNN is final recognition result. The new method is applied to 221 natural scene images taken by the vehicle-borne mobile photogrammetry system in Nanjing at different time. Experimental results show a recognition rate of over 98 %. Especially, {{the problem of}} confirming optimal projection number in central projection transformation is solved by the information entropy in this paper. Moreover, the proposed recognition method is compared with other recognition methods based on three kinds of invariant moments. Results of contrastive experiments also show that the method proposed in this paper is effective and reliable. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Traffic</b> <b>sign</b> {{classification}} is {{a challenging}} problem in Computer Vision {{due to the}} high variability of sign appearance in uncontrolled environments. Lack of visibility, illumination changes, and partial occlusions {{are just a few}} problems. In this paper, we introduce a classification technique for <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> <b>recognition</b> by means of Error Correcting Output Codes. Recently, new proposals of coding and decoding strategies for the Error Correcting Output Codes framework {{have been shown to be}} very effective in front of multiclass problems. We review the state-of-the-art ECOC strategies and combinations of problem-dependent coding designs and decoding techniques. We apply these approaches to the Mobile Mapping problem. We detect the sign regions by means of Adaboost. The Adaboost in an attentional cascade with the extended set of Haar-like features estimated on the integral shows great performance at the detection step. Then, a spatial normalization using the Hough transform and the fast radial symmetry is done. The model fitting improves the final classification performance by normalizing the sign content. Finally, we classify a wide set of <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> types, obtaining high success in adverse conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} robust visual speed limit <b>signs</b> {{detection}} and <b>recognition</b> systems for American and European signs. Both are variants {{of the same}} modular <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> <b>recognition</b> architecture, with a sign detection step based only on shape-detection (rectangles or circles), which makes our systems insensitive to color variability and quite robust to illumination variations. Instead of a global recognition, our system classifies (or rejects) the speed-limit sign candidates by segmenting potential digits inside them, and then applying a neural network digit recognition. This helps handling global sign variability, as long as digits are properly recognized. The global sign detection rate is around 90 % for both (standard) U. S. and E.

40|$|Man-made object {{detection}} is {{of great}} significance in both military and civil areas, such as search-and-rescue missions at sea, <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> <b>recognition</b> during visual navigation, and targets location in a military strike. Contours of man-made objects usually consist of straight lines, corner points, and simple curves. Motivated by this observation, a man-made object detection method is proposed based on complexity evaluation of object contours. After salient contours which keep the crucial information of objects are accurately extracted using an improved mean-shift clustering algorithm, a novel approach is presented to evaluate the complexity of contours. By comparing the entropy values of contours before/after sampling and linear interpolation, {{it is easy to}} distinguish between man-made objects and natural ones according to the complexity of their contours. Experimental results show that the presented method can effectively detect man-made objects when compared to the existing ones.

40|$|Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) are biologically-inspired {{multi-stage}} architectures {{that automatically}} learn hierarchies of invariant features. While many popular vision approaches use hand-crafted {{features such as}} HOG or SIFT, ConvNets learn features at every levels from data that are tuned to the task at hand. The traditional ConvNet architecture was modified by feeding 1 st stage features in addition to 2 nd stage features to the classifier. We apply these multi-scale ConvNets to the tasks of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> classification and pedestrian detection and establish new accuracy records, above human performance for road signs. We also show an significant accuracy gain on the pedestrian task when using unsupervised pre-training with Convolutional Predictive Sparse Coding [1] (ConvPSD).
