40|$|The clock offset {{between a}} GPS-based NTP time server and NTP time client software, {{installed}} in the MS Windows Operating System (OS) and the Linux OS on PCs, are measured and evaluated. The clock offset on MS Windows 98 OS shows a trend {{with a range of}} about 55 ms. The NTP time client software on MS Windows OS adjusts the internal clock with the Application Program Interface (API) <b>timer</b> <b>function.</b> The resolution of the API <b>timer</b> <b>function</b> depends on the hardware interrupt of the PC system timer, which is 54. 9 ms of IRQ 0 for MS Windows 98 OS. Thus, this range of the trend in the clock offset is considered to be caused by the resolution of API <b>timer</b> <b>function.</b> The clock offset on MS Windows XP OS shows time resolutions of 1 ms for the 1 ms API timer mode and 10 ms for the 10 ms API timer mode. The resolution of 1 ms is dependent on a hardware interrupt of IRQ 8 (976 μs) that is generated by a PC real-time clock. The resolution of the system timer on MS-windows XP depends on the hardware platform and shows 10 ms or 15 ms. The clock offset on Linux OS also has a trend as well as a periodic divergence. The trend interval of the drift is estimated to be about 35 minutes. The origin of this trend in interval is presumed to be the loop constant of the kernel Phase Lock Loop (PLL). The Standard Deviation of this clock offset for 24 hours is 0. 95 ms. Evidently, both MS Windows OS and Linux OS adopt different algorithms for keeping the internal clock. The accuracy of time synchronization by NTP is restricted by the algorithms. The limitation of the time synchronization accuracy on MS Windows OS is related to the resolution of API that depends on a hardware interrupt generated in the PC hardware system timer and real-time clock. On the other hand, the loop constant of the kernel clock algorithm restricts the time synchronization accuracy by NTP on Linux OS. I...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} development of a vision-based system that able to detect the vacancy of parking spaces using image processing technique, namely through the adaptive twin ROI mode approach. In performing the parking space detection, a special computer program called ‘detector’ has been developed using the combination of OpenCV and FLTK libraries. The program which is used with web camera and notebook computer is dedicated to perform all methods that are proposed in this research. The system that has been developed is targeted to detect the parking space during daytime in outdoor environment and can work in different weather and lighting conditions such as under bright sunlight, during rainy day or in shady surroundings. The procedure in performing the parking space detection is divided into four stages namely the image acquisition, image preprocessing, ROI setting and colour detection stage. In the image acquisition stage, three ways {{have been identified as}} the method to perform the image acquisition techniques, which they are the real situation, traffic-type and offline image file technique. Next, in image preprocessing stage, the acquired image is applied with blurring effect to reduce noise and also applied with conversion function. The conversion function converts the acquired image which originally in BGR colour space into the other popular formats namely the HSV and YUV. The ROI setting stage involves assigning the position of the ROIs onto the desired parking slots and applying the range of colour that represents the parking space background colour to the ROIs which is called as ‘allowable range’ in this thesis. Finally, in the colour detection stage, the ROIs that have been properly set are performed with pixels analysis that compares each of the pixels inside the ROI with the allowable range defined in previous stage. The pixels which their colour value is inside the allowable range will be categorized as the parking space pixels and the rest will be assumed as the vehicle’s pixels which will trigger the occupation status once the threshold value is exceeded. Several methods are introduced in overcoming the issues that have arisen in this research. Some of them include the single and twin ROI mode, the AND and OR Boolean logical operators, <b>timer</b> <b>function,</b> control ROI function and finally the shadow filtering feature. All of the methods are analyzed to view their capability and efficiency in solving the arisen issues. Through the combination of the proposed methods, {{it can be seen that}} the result of the parking space detection achieved 88. 9 % of success rate. The rest of 11. 1 % failure rate is caused by the confusion of the detector with the vehicle and parking space colour and should be overcome if more checking ROIs per parking space are implemented in the future...|$|E
40|$|From {{a simple}} {{electronic}} devices to replace sophisticated electro-mechanical relays, nowadays PLCs are extensively used in industrial automation field {{and they are}} integrated into much larger environment, capable of almost any type of control applications, including motion control and instrumentation. It {{is well known that}} PLC related processes in manufacturing lines are safety-critical systems because of the increasing number of embedded functions and features. These are beneficial for engineers since they can design and develop sophisticated and complex control programs up {{to the best of their}} knowledge and capabilities. On the other hand, this introduces a potential safety risk; thus, their effects on system reliability need to be investigated more thoroughly. Moreover, any failure of these control systems might not only result in a significant financial loss but lead to casualties as well. Hence, their actual programming and the correctness of the programs play a vital role. Manufacturing automation is facing strong demands for high reliability of process control systems. These include the flexibility and safety requirements in order to improve the performance of machines and equipments in manufacturing lines. For example, prior to the commissioning of new machines or production lines, it is necessary to ensure that the designed control programs will not violate any previously determined control specifications. In other words, appropriate preventive actions should be taken in advance so that the process runs in a safe system configuration; thus, avoiding additional corrective procedures due to unsafe or failures of operations. Formal verification of correctness of a property (i. e. deadlock freeness) in a system follows the steps which are; identify the properties that need to be verified, build an abstract model of the system (including the surrounding environment), identify the parts of the systems that are interesting, and mathematically show that the property always holds in the region of interest. Even more interesting is that when having all this information, beside verification one can even compute a correct "solution". The formal verification process is nowadays plays an important role in industrial automation complex problem solving. Implementation of verification procedures is required to eliminate design errors that decrease the safety of automation systems. Design errors may vary from case to case but will certainly jeopardize the safety of manufacturing lines and operators. Therefore, checking the possibility of state transitions in the control systems from safe to unsafe states is essential. Formal verification via model checking procedures has proven to be efficient and is widely used. System finite element models are employed to automatically verify certain correctness properties. In this study, we propose a novel method of model checking for logic control design. A checking procedure based on Gr ? bner bases (GB) model is used to analyze and design a controller that meets the requirements defined by a predetermined safety function. We compare the proposed method with symbolic computation tree logic (CTL) model checking based on binary decision diagrams. A crane system is used as a case study. In addition, we compare the computational efficiency of the methods and present counterexamples by unsafe conditions. Our works presented in the thesis deal with safety design and verification and validation (V&V) of logic control systems that are widely used in manufacturing processes. Two methods, one is a proposed method of Gr ? bner bases computation and the other is conventional BDD-based model checking, are used to verify the safety of the designed controller, by using predetermined safety properties based on known hazardous states of a logic control system. The model checking based on Gr ? bner bases computation is our novel work that uses algebraic approach, compare to BDD-based model checking that proposes symbolic computations. We also carry out verification of other temporal properties, such as reachability, liveness and fairness evaluation by using the BDD-based model checking approach. We perform a number of experiments to validate the safety of designed controllers using an arm pick-and-place model, considered as two types of control systems, which are a two cranes system and a nondeterministic arm pick-and-place system. Performance analysis on computational complexity between both verification methods is also thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, we introduce a formal modeling and verification of PLC nondeterministic behavior with ladder diagram (LD) implementation. We provide an illustrative example by using an arm pick-and-place model and design the LD program for the arm, with application of a timer ON and timer OFF function blocks. The nondeterministic behaviors are configured from an arm grip condition and also from the logical formalism of both timers properties. By applying several logical properties to the arm model, we verify the deterministic and nondeterministic behaviors and illustrate experimental results for validation of arm safe operation. This work contributes to safety verification and validation of an arm pick-and-place operationa model nondeterministic behaviors, model verification using logical properties with inclusion of nondeterministic behaviors from state operation and <b>timer</b> <b>function,</b> and application of the timer OFF function block for safety experiments and implementation liveness property check...|$|E

40|$|Route flap is an {{undesirable}} {{phenomenon in}} the Internet {{and needs to be}} eliminated for more stable and robust networks. In this paper we present our observations of such persistent route flaps on OSPF in some detail. We show how flaps adversely affect OSPF routing and communication environment in general through our experiments. The current OSPF’s implicit <b>timer</b> damping <b>function</b> is found inefficient as each flap may lead to a few seconds of lost connectivity. We implemented a scheme for damping the route flaps and show as to how this methodology can solve such problems in OSPF. Our implementation shows considerable improvement over the ones where none of such techniques were applied. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} the male cricket consists of the mating stage and the sexually refractory stage. The latter is further divided into the first refractory stage (RS 1) from spermatophore extrusion in copulation to spermatophore preparation after copulation, and the second refractory stage (RS 2) from spermatophore preparation to recommencement of a calling song. RS 2 is time-fixed and unaffected by the female or by stress, hence RS 2 {{is assumed to be}} controlled by the reproductive timer. Previously, we suggested that the timer is located in the terminal abdominal ganglion (TAG), because functional inactivation of the TAG by local cooling lengthened RS 2 in proportion to cooling time. To obtain further evidence of timer localization and to examine the operation of the timer in dissected animals, we investigated the characteristics of auto-spermatophore extrusion, a phenomenon in which males eject the mature spermatophore themselves without any prior courtship. The occurrence of auto-spermatophore extrusion was 100 % in dissected males with the TAG separated, compared to 1. 7 % in intact males. The time interval (SPaSE) between spermatophore preparation and autospermatophore extrusion was comparable to RS 2 measured by the calling song. Spike recording from a genital motor neurone in the separated TAG indicated that burst discharge associated with auto-spermatophore extrusion occurred with a SPaSE comparable to RS 2. Other efferent neurones, some of which were identified as dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurones, showed a timedependent spike frequency increase during SPaSE. These results strengthen our previous conclusion that the reproductive timer is located within the TAG, and demonstrate that the <b>timer</b> <b>functions</b> normally even when the TAG is separated from the central nervous system. </p...|$|R
40|$|Designing new {{protocols}} for Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) is a {{great challenge}} due to their distributed and self organized nature. Though, aspects of approved algorithms for hierarchical topographies may be carried over to these flat networks. The IEEE 802. 11 protocol supports ad hoc networks in small scale applications, but its performance in large scale environments is still under investigation. Besides the Distributed Coordination <b>Function</b> (DCF), the <b>Timer</b> Synchronization <b>Function</b> (TSF) can be significantly improved {{in order to increase}} the performance in large scale multihop networks. This article presents systematic extensions to the TSF that allow increasing the overall reliability and disburdening the network at the same time.
