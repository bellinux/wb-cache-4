5|$|A {{number of}} design faults of the Tetrarch were {{revealed}} through its operational use. Its size limited the possible crew to three, a {{driver in the}} hull and a gunner and commander in the turret, resulting in too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or commander, {{in addition to his}} own duties, had to act as loader for the 2 pounder, which caused delays in combat. A report on the tank written in January 1941 stated <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> commander had to both fight and control the tank, controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible.|$|E
5|$|Brundage {{took the}} {{position}} <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Germans had reported nondiscrimination to the IOC, and the IOC had accepted that report, US Olympic authorities were bound by that determination. Nevertheless, it became increasingly apparent {{that with the}} Nazi actions, no Jew was likely to secure {{a place on the}} German team. Brundage stated on this issue that as only 12Jews had ever represented Germany in the Olympics, it would hardly be surprising if none did in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Curtis {{admitted}} in a 2004 documentary that just before recording began, producer John Lloyd {{came up to}} him with Atkinson and asked what Edmund's character was. Curtis then realised that, despite writing some funny lines, {{he had no idea how}} Rowan Atkinson was supposed to play his part. On the 25th anniversary documentary Blackadder Rides Again, Atkinson added <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> cameras were about to roll for the first time, he suddenly realised he wasn't even sure what voice to use for the character.|$|E

5|$|Despite the affairs, Sharaf writes <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{newspaper}} {{campaign against}} Reich gained pace, he developed an intense jealousy toward Lindenberg, demanding that she {{not have a}} separate life of any kind. He even physically assaulted a composer with whom she was working. Lindenberg considered calling the police but decided Reich could not afford another scandal. His behaviour took its toll on their relationship, and when Reich asked her to accompany him to the United States, she said no.|$|E

5|$|In {{front of}} a jury, the city's art censor Jeremiah O'Connor testified that September Morn was lewd {{and should not be}} {{displayed}} in public, but rather only in a museum exhibition. W.W.Hallam of the Chicago Vice Committee agreed, arguing <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> woman was committing the illegal act of bathing in public, September Morn had to be banned. Other witnesses for the prosecution included censors, educators, and clergy, such as the superintendent Ella Flagg Young {{and the head of the}} Juvenile Protective Association Gertrude Howe Britton.|$|E
5|$|Micheline Connery, Sean's wife, had met up-and-coming actress Kim Basinger at a {{hotel in}} London and {{suggested}} her to Connery, which he agreed upon. For the role of Felix Leiter, Connery spoke with Bernie Casey, saying <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Leiter role was never remembered by audiences, using a black Leiter might make him more memorable. Others cast included comedian Rowan Atkinson, who would later parody Bond in his role of Johnny English.|$|E

5|$|On 19 June 1250, {{following}} the canonisation of Malcolm's wife Margaret by Pope Innocent IV, Margaret's remains were disinterred {{and placed in}} a reliquary.

As a result, Malcolm's remains were also disinterred, and buried next to Margaret beside the altar.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Appeal held further <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{discretion}} conferred by section 8 of the ISA involved national security, {{the issue}} of whether detention was necessary should be left solely to executive discretion. However, the Court referred to two United Kingdom decisions which stood for the principle that courts are not precluded from determining whether a decision is in fact based on grounds of national security. Therefore, the court could still determine whether the matters relied on by the executive in the exercise of discretion were indeed within the scope of section 8.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenge}} for NASA's imaging team was <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> mission progressed, the objects being photographed were getting {{farther away from}} the spacecraft, therefore appearing fainter and requiring longer exposures and even slewing (panning) of the cameras to achieve good quality. The telecommunication capability also decreased with distance, limiting the number of data modes that could be used by the imaging system.|$|E

5|$|Typical pulsar periods {{for young}} pulsars {{are of the}} order of one second, and they {{increase}} with time; the very short periods exhibited by so-called millisecond pulsars are due to the transfer of material from a binary companion. The pulse period of PSR B1620-26 is a few milliseconds, providing strong evidence for matter transfer. It is believed <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> pulsar's red giant companion expanded, it filled and then exceeded its Roche lobe, so that its surface layers started being transferred onto the neutron star.|$|E

The SFU wanted to abandon the match, but Gallaher and the tour manager George Dixon contended that the weather would improve enough for the pitch to thaw, and the match was eventually allowed to proceed. The Test was closely contested, with Scotland leading 7–6 at half-time, but the All Blacks scored two late tries to win 12–7; despite the close score-line, the New Zealanders were clearly the better of the two sides.|$|E
