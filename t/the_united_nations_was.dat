5|$|During the 1929 {{stock market}} crash and {{subsequent}} economic depression, not a single San Francisco-based bank failed, while the region attempted to spur job growth by simultaneously undertaking two large infrastructure projects: construction of the Golden Gate Bridge, which would connect San Francisco with Marin County, and the Bay Bridge, which would connect San Francisco with Oakland and the East Bay. After the United States joined World War II in 1941, the Bay Area became a major domestic military and naval hub, with large shipyards constructed in Sausalito and across the East Bay to build ships for the war effort, and Fort Mason acting the primary port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater of Operations. After the war, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>was</b> chartered in San Francisco to help prevent the kind of devastation that occurred over the past decade, and on September 1951, Japan officially surrendered to the Allied forces in San Francisco, with the Treaty of San Francisco entering into force a year later. In the years immediately following the war, the Bay Area saw a huge wave of immigration as populations increased across the region. Between 1950 and 1960, San Francisco welcomed over 100,000 new residents, inland suburbs in the East Bay saw their populations double, Daly City's population quadrupled, and Santa Clara's population quintupled.|$|E

5|$|The {{flooding}} on Mangaia persisted {{for nearly}} a week before finally subsiding. Once the waters receded, {{the full extent of}} damage was revealed. Although only minor structural damage was sustained, the agricultural sector received extensive losses. Nearly 90% of the islands' staple crop was lost and about 60% of all the livestock perished. Following an assessment made by the Cook Islands National Disaster Management Council, it was determined that US$52,000 was needed to repair losses from Trina. International assistance from <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>was</b> eventually requested on December12, allowing for relief funds from several agencies to be delivered to the area. Fears of food shortages also prompted the local government to begin stockpiling food should it become a necessary relief supply. A total of US$24,140 was committed in relief funds by New Zealand, Norway and the United Nations to assist the Cook Islands in recovering from the storm. By late-December, an additional F$20,000 (US$11,000) was distributed by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat to the affected islands. In the months following Cyclone Trina, debris removal and cleanup was relatively slow, delaying efforts to replant crops lost in the floods. Food shortage issues became apparent in February 2002, prompting the IFRC to distribute food to all of Mangaia's residents.|$|E
5|$|Undeterred, Bruce {{was elected}} Chairman {{of the newly}} formed FAO Council in November 1947, working once more with John Boyd Orr, now Secretary-General of the FAO. Acute {{shortages}} of cereals and livestock were rampant following severe droughts in Europe, and the international food supply system was under serious strain after the devastation of the war. Bruce and the council worked in these years to distribute fertiliser and agricultural machinery, as well as improve nutrition, especially in less developed nations. More {{than two-thirds of the}} world was undernourished in 1949 and Bruce felt it imperative for the Council to bring these stark facts to the developed nations. A landmark agreement on technical aid between the FAO and <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>was</b> reached in November 1949, and the FAO received the funding and logistical capacity to act on the food shortage crisis and the problems of poor nutrition in the developing world. Bruce and the FAO were successful in these years in supporting the recovery of world agricultural output. By 1951 this had exceeded pre-war levels, and general levels of nutrition were rising internationally, but by the time Bruce stepped down in that year neither had improved fast enough {{to keep pace with the}} post-war population boom. The Council faced major obstacles in supporting the improvement of conditions in the developing world as governments there began diverting resources to arms programs as independence, post-colonial and Cold War conflicts multiplied. Frustrated by continuing world conflict and the lack of commitment from the developed world to support the lofty but very difficult aims of the FAO, both Bruce and Orr resigned from the FAO disappointed by its modest gains and insufficient powers to alleviate world food problems.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} urgent {{problems}} concerned {{the future of the}} Palestine Mandate. It had become too troublesome and much too expensive to handle. British policies there were perceived by the Zionist movement and the Truman Administration as pro-Arab and anti-Jewish. In the face of an armed revolt of Jewish militant groups and increasing violence of the local Arab population, Britain had found itself unable to control events. This was a very unpopular commitment, and the evacuation of British troops and subsequent handing over of the issue to <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>was</b> widely supported by the British public.|$|E

25|$|The United Nations Trusteeship Council, {{one of the}} {{principal}} organs of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations,</b> <b>was</b> established to help ensure that trust territories were administered {{in the best interests of}} their inhabitants and of international peace and security. The trust territories—most of them are former mandates of the League of Nations or territories taken from nations defeated at the end of World War II—have all now attained self-government or independence, either as separate nations or by joining neighbouring independent countries. The last was Palau, formerly part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, which became a member state of the United Nations in December 1994.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{forerunner of}} <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>was</b> the League of Nations. It was created at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, and {{emerged from the}} advocacy of Woodrow Wilson and other idealists during World War I. The Covenant of the League of Nations {{was included in the}} Treaty of Versailles in 1919, and the League was based in Geneva until its dissolution as a result of World War II and replacement by the United Nations. The high hopes widely held for the League in the 1920s, for example amongst members of the League of Nations Union, gave way to widespread disillusion in the 1930s as the League struggled to respond to challenges from Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Japan.|$|E
25|$|An {{independence}} movement lasting many decades eventually prevailed, {{leading to the}} end of the French protectorate (commenced in 1881). In 1954 the Tunisian struggle and consequent civil disturbances resulted in the start of negotiations for autonomy between France and the Neo Destour political party (essentially under Habib Bourguiba) supported by the Tunisian labor unions and by the Arab League. The agreed Convention of April, 1955, stated that France would retain control of the army and foreign affairs while granting autonomy, which was to begin the following year. Bourguiba was released from prison by the French to a tumultuous welcome. This compromise, however, split the Neo Destour; eventually it led to suppression of its left wing, and expulsion of its radical, pan-Arab leader Salah ben Youssef (or Yusuf), who later fled to Egypt. This resolution of intra-party strife signalled that Neo Destour would pursue a moderate path. The French then terminated their protectorate over Morocco, in order to concentrate their forces in Algeria. In reaction, and following the strong public opinion voiced by Tunisians, Bourguiba pressed for independence. The French, overcoming the heated objections of the French settlers, eventually acceded and protocols were drafted. On 20 March 1956, Tunisia achieved its full sovereignty. In July Tunisia's application for membership in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>was</b> accepted.|$|E

500|$|Progressives welcomed {{these new}} {{international}} organizations and {{regimes in the}} aftermath of the two World Wars, but argued that they suffered from a democratic deficit and were therefore inadequate not only to prevent another global war but to foster global justice. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>was</b> designed in 1945 by US bankers and State Department planners, and was always intended to remain a free association of sovereign nation-states, not a transition to democratic world government.

500|$|Du Bois was {{a member}} of the three-person {{delegation}} from the NAACP that attended the 1945 conference in San Francisco at which <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>was</b> established. The NAACP delegation wanted the United Nations to endorse racial equality and to bring an end to the colonial era. To push the United Nations in that direction, Du Bois drafted a proposal that pronounced [...] "he colonial system of government is undemocratic, socially dangerous and a main cause of wars". The NAACP proposal received support from China, Russia and India, but it was virtually ignored by the other major powers, and the NAACP proposals were not included in the United Nations charter.|$|E
500|$|In 1971, the IOC offered Rhodesia the {{opportunity}} {{to compete in the}} upcoming 1972 Summer Olympics if it did so with a British identity, which included using the flag of Southern Rhodesia and [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] as their anthem, as it had in 1964. Host nation West Germany faced less pressure than Mexico and, having not been admitted to <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations,</b> <b>was</b> not bound by Resolution 253. Rhodesia agreed and sent 44 athletes in eight sports (including a water polo squad) to Munich in its largest and most diverse delegation. Another threat of boycott from African nations, however, led the IOC to withdraw Rhodesia's invitation by a vote of 36–31 in favor, with three abstentions. The athletes were allowed to remain in the Olympic Village and attend their events, but were forbidden from participating. Following the Munich massacre, IOC President Avery Brundage compared the attacks to the political motivation behind the boycott, arguing that both were seeking to dampen the spirit of Olympism.|$|E
