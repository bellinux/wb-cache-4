5|$|Horsefield founded {{one such}} society, the Prestwich Botanical Society, {{and was later}} {{president}} of a larger botanical society covering a wide area around north Manchester. He made several botanical discoveries and cultivated two new plants. A number of his writings about <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>class</b> and also some poetry were published, but nothing concerning botany other than {{in connection with the}} subject of <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>class.</b> He lived most of his life near Whitefield in Lancashire, in dire poverty.

5|$|In 1931, 9.4% of Wigan's {{population}} was middle class compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased to 12.4% compared with 24% nationally. Parallel to this {{slight increase in}} the middle classes of Wigan was the decline of <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>class</b> population. In 1931, 38.7% were working class compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 33.5% in Wigan and 26% nationwide. The rest of the {{population was}} made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers or other miscellaneous. The slow decrease in <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>class</b> goes against the trend for a steeper national decline, reinforcing the perception of Wigan as a working-class town.|$|E

5|$|On 28 August 1844, Marx met the German socialist Friedrich Engels at the Café de la Régence, {{beginning}} a lifelong friendship. Engels showed Marx his recently published The Condition of <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Class</b> in England in 1844, convincing Marx that <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>class</b> {{would be the}} agent and instrument of the final revolution in history. Soon, Marx and Engels were collaborating on a criticism of the philosophical ideas of Marx's former friend, Bruno Bauer. This work was published in 1845 as The Holy Family. Although critical of Bauer, Marx was increasingly influenced by {{the ideas of the}} Young Hegelians Max Stirner and Ludwig Feuerbach, but eventually Marx and Engels abandoned Feuerbachian materialism as well.|$|E

60|$|You {{have given}} {{a great deal of}} {{gratuitous}} instruction to <b>the</b> <b>working</b> classes?--Not so much to <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>classes</b> as to <b>the</b> class which especially attends the lectures on drawing, but which of course is connected with <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>classes,</b> and through which I know something about them.|$|R
25|$|The Revolutionary Communist Group is a {{communist}} organisation.

5|$|The other {{important}} contribution to Marx's revision of Hegelianism came from Engels's book, The Condition of <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Class</b> in England in 1844, which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of class conflict {{and to see the}} modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution.|$|E

In his book The Condition of <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Class</b> in England in 1844, Friedrich Engels referred to it as the Mons Sacer of Manchester. This was a reference to the hill to which the plebs (common citizens) of Rome withdrew en masse in 494 BC as an act of civil protest.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} in his {{parliamentary}} career Disraeli hoped to forge a paternalistic Tory-Radical alliance, but he was unsuccessful. Before the Reform Act 1867, <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>class</b> did not possess the vote and therefore had little political power. Although Disraeli forged a personal friendship with John Bright, a Lancashire manufacturer and leading Radical, Disraeli was unable to persuade Bright to sacrifice his distinct position for parliamentary advancement. When Disraeli attempted to secure a Tory-Radical cabinet in 1852, Bright refused.|$|E

5|$|In 1912 the Reformist Party was founded, which {{attracted}} intellectuals.

5|$|Several {{characteristics}} {{about the}} Tribune made the newspaper an excellent vehicle for Marx {{to reach a}} sympathetic public across the Atlantic Ocean. Since its founding, the Tribune had been an inexpensive newspaper—two cents per copy. Accordingly, it was popular with the broad masses of <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>class</b> of the United States. With a run of about 50,000 issues, the Tribune was the most widely circulated journal in the United States. Editorially, the Tribune reflected Greeley's anti-slavery opinions. Not only did the Tribune have wide readership with the United States and not only did that readership come from the working classes, but the readers seemed {{to be from the}} progressive wing of <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>class.</b> Marx's first article for the New York Tribune was on the British elections to Parliament and was published in the Tribune on 21 August 1852.|$|E
