2500|$|The term [...] "Gifted Assessment" [...] is {{typically}} applied [...] {{to a process}} of using norm-referenced psychometric tests administered by a qualified psychologist or psychometrist {{with the goal of}} identifying children whose intellectual functioning is significantly advanced as compared to the appropriate reference group (i.e., individuals of their age, gender, and country). The cut-off score for differentiating this group is usually determined by district school boards and can differ slightly from area to area, however, the majority defines this group as students scoring in the top 2 percentiles on one of the accepted tests of intellectual (cognitive) functioning or IQ. Some school boards also require a child to demonstrate advanced academic standing on individualized achievement tests and/ or through their classroom performance. Identifying gifted children is often difficult but is very important because typical school <b>teachers</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> qualified to educate a gifted student.
