25|$|High Crag {{forms the}} eastern {{terminus}} of the Buttermere Fells, its most arresting feature being the great scree slopes of Gamlin End where {{the high ground}} falls away. 700ft below, the ridge levels out once more and <b>throws</b> <b>up</b> the craggy top of Seat (1,840ft). A final steep descent then leads to Scarth Gap, a walkers' pass between Buttermere and Ennerdale.|$|E
25|$|From {{the wide}} summit of Red Screes a {{narrowing}} ridge curves northward, passing {{around the rim}} of a cove on the Kirkstone side. The ridge, named Smallthwaite Band, narrows to a fine grassy promenade and then <b>throws</b> <b>up</b> the summit of Middle Dodd. Beyond this {{the character of the}} fell changes completely and a rough slope plunges straight down to the valley floor, 1,500ft below.|$|E
25|$|From {{the rocky}} summit of Little Hart Crag a {{narrowing}} ridge descends north eastward on grass. The ground is quite wet {{and there are}} areas of peat and sedge. After half a mile of steady fall, the ridge <b>throws</b> <b>up</b> the barely perceptible summit of High Harsop Dodd. Beyond this {{the character of the}} fell changes completely and a steep slope plunges straight down to the valley floor.|$|E

25|$|As {{the spur}} falling north from High Raise {{gradually}} narrows, the ground becomes rockier, until a sudden {{turn toward the}} east <b>throws</b> <b>up</b> a knuckle of crag. The main face is on the north western flank, cut by a gully, with the lower slabs providing {{the majority of the}} rock climbing. Bull crag is also on this flank, a little to the south. From Sergeant's Crag the ridge drops slightly before reaching its terminus at Eagle Crag.|$|E
25|$|He bowls {{fast and}} {{obviously}} scorns to conserve his strength. He is {{in a hurry}} to be at the batsman. He turns sharply to begin his run, jumps off at a great pace, <b>throws</b> <b>up</b> his arm high, and then makes a terrifying leap into the air—a leap which one feels should be accompanied by a yell. At the end of his over he snaps up the ball, if it is anywhere within reach, and passes it hurriedly to the colleague who is having at them at the other end. With it all, his length was under control, and for a time the batsmen could make nothing of him.|$|E

25|$|Each {{party has}} two goals, {{ten or fifteen}} yards apart. The parties, ten or fifteen on a side, stand in line, facing each other at about ten yards’ {{distance}} midway between their goals and that of their adversaries. An indifferent spectator <b>throws</b> <b>up</b> a ball {{the size of a}} cricket ball midway between the confronted players and makes his escape. The rush is to catch the falling ball. He who first can catch or seize it speeds home, making his way through his opponents and aided by his own sidesmen. If caught and held or rather in danger of being held, for if caught with the ball in possession he loses a snotch, he throws the ball (he must in no case give it) to some less beleaguered friend more free and more in breath than himself, who if it be not arrested in its course or be jostled away by the eager and watchful adversaries, catches it; and he in like manner hastens homeward, in like manner pursued, annoyed and aided, winning the notch or snotch if he contrive to carry or throw it within the goals. At a loss and gain of a snotch a recommencement takes place.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Daenerys has to eat a horse's heart was filmed in The Paint Hall studio in Belfast. There, the {{production}} built the Dothraki temple in which the scene is set – a large semicircular structure of wood and woven reeds, inspired by Marsh Arab constructions. [...] The heart actress Emilia Clarke ate was, according to Weiss, [...] "basically a giant, three-pound gummi bear covered in fake sugar blood – which has the added attraction of drawing real flies." [...] Through repeated takes, Clarke did have to eat much of the sugary heart. She said that it tasted of bleach and was made tough and gristly {{by the addition of}} valves made from [...] "something like dried pasta." [...] Clarke did not have to act in the shots {{at the end of the}} {{scene in which}} Daenerys almost <b>throws</b> <b>up</b> the last bit of heart, as she was indeed close to vomiting at that point.|$|E

500|$|In {{some of the}} raw moments {{captured}} in the documentary, Beyoncé appears completely bare. During one video, Beyoncé cries and asks herself: [...] "Why did God give me this life? Sometimes it's overwhelming. Why did God give me my talent, my gift, my family. But I know you're not supposed to question God." [...] She told Entertainment Tonight: [...] "I {{wanted to do something}} a little different with the film ... I wanted people to re-experience the show in a different way. Everyone that had been to the show -- I wanted them to see things that they didn't get to see. I figured it would be cool for everyone to see it from my point of view. It's a peek behind the curtain ... honestly, more than no makeup, the emotions and just being so real and raw, I don't think I'd be able to let down my guard the way I did if anybody was in the room." [...] The last minutes of the film get very sentimental, with a performance of Etta James's classic [...] "At Last" [...] set to the backdrop of Civil Rights-era footage, followed by a close-up moment when Beyoncé admits that her life can be overwhelming, although she is blessed, stating, [...] "I'm grateful... I'm alive and I'm living my dreams." [...] The film's final performance shows Beyoncé performing [...] "Halo" [...] and sees her paying tribute to Michael Jackson. She also splices in footage of an old video from the night she attended her first Michael Jackson concert as a child. At the end of the performance, the whole production wraps as Beyoncé <b>throws</b> <b>up</b> the Roc sign and exits the stage.|$|E

Similarly, Claire Suddath of Time {{magazine}} commented that [...] "1+1" [...] is probably the finest ballad Beyoncé has delivered in years. Amos Barshad of New York magazine described [...] "1+1" [...] as [...] "a big grand love ballad". Andy Kellman of Allmusic picked [...] "1+1" [...] {{as one of the}} album's top songs, describing it as [...] "a sparse and placid vocal showcase, [...] fades in with a somber guitar line, <b>throws</b> <b>up</b> occasional and brief spikes in energy, and slowly recedes." [...] Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound commented that in contrast to the geometry taught at school, there is something interesting in [...] "1+1"; he further wrote that ballad focuses on Beyoncé's [...] "amazing vocal range" [...] as it is not upbeat like most of her previous offerings. Leah Collins of Canada's Dose described the song as a [...] "melodramatic soul ballad". A reporter from The Huffington Post stated that [...] "1+1" [...] is a departure from [...] "Run the World (Girls)", noting that Beyoncé [...] "replac the defiance of [...] with devotion" [...] ". He added that {{it is one of the}} first representations that [...] "Beyoncé is keeping her promise that a whole new array of sounds will make their way into 4." [...] Similarly, Rap-Up favored the track stating that [...] "If 'Run the World (Girls)' wasn't your thing, this should do the trick." [...] By contrast, Katy Hasty from HitFix criticized the song's lyrics and wrote that it [...] "seem the lyrics to '1+1' were penned by a second-grader." ...|$|E

Their seventh gig was billed at the Southport Arts Center, which Chris Hardwick of Folk Roots reviewed with the following introduction: [...] "Every {{once in a while}} the folk scene <b>throws</b> <b>up</b> a new permutation in which exceptionally gifted individuals come together to produce something so innovative and exhilarating that it goes way beyond the sum of the parts".|$|E
2500|$|Olives are {{propagated}} {{by various}} methods. The preferred ways are cuttings and layers; the tree roots easily in favourable soil and <b>throws</b> <b>up</b> suckers from the stump when cut down. However, yields from trees grown from suckers or seeds are poor; {{they must be}} budded or grafted onto other specimens to do well. Branches of various thickness cut into lengths around [...] planted deeply in manured ground soon vegetate. Shorter pieces are sometimes laid horizontally in shallow trenches and, when covered with a few centimetres of soil, rapidly throw up sucker-like shoots. In Greece, grafting the cultivated tree on the wild tree is a common practice. In Italy, embryonic buds, which form small swellings on the stems, are carefully excised and planted under the soil surface, where they soon form a vigorous shoot.|$|E
2500|$|Norris' {{change in}} {{position}} received varying reactions from commentators.

2500|$|Marvelman (later retitled Miracleman {{for legal}} reasons) {{was a series}} that {{originally}} had been published in Britain from 1954 through to 1963, based largely upon the American comic Captain Marvel. Upon resurrecting Marvelman, Moore [...] "took a kitsch children's character and placed him within {{the real world of}} 1982". The work was drawn primarily by Garry Leach and Alan Davis. The third series that Moore produced for Warrior was The Bojeffries Saga, a comedy about a working-class English family of vampires and werewolves, drawn by Steve Parkhouse. Warrior closed before these stories were completed, but under new publishers both Miracleman and V for Vendetta were resumed by Moore, who finished both stories by 1989. Moore's biographer Lance Parkin remarked that [...] "reading them through together <b>throws</b> <b>up</b> some interesting contrasts – in one the hero fights a fascist dictatorship based in London, in the other an Aryan superman imposes one." ...|$|E
