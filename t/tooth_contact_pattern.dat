40|$|The {{hypoid gear}} is an {{excellent}} gear and its quality is estimated from the <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>pattern.</b> In general, when the load changes under operation, the relative positions of the pinion and gear also change slightly, and the <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> moves from {{the central part of}} the tooth surface towards the toe or the heel. It is considered that this is caused by such factors as the deflection of the housing or bearing, and assembly error. However, in all such cases a good <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> must be maintained to transmit revolution with an exact angular velocity ratio. Therefore we study the characteristics of the hypoid gear <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> that are caused by movement to both sides of the tooth surface. In the present report, the theoretical analysis for obtaining an accurate <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> is described...|$|E
40|$|Friction {{loss and}} {{scuffing}} failure are two primary research subjects {{in improving the}} performance of spiral bevel gears. Aimed at improving the thermal characteristics with machine-setting parameter adjustment, a coupled thermo-elastic 3 D finite element model has been developed to analyse the frictional heat generation and transient thermal behaviour of spiral bevel gears. The heat fluxes due to friction effects are applied to the gear tooth to investigate thermal characteristics and prediction of transient temperature fields. The resulting thermal characteristics agree with earlier work, thus verifying the model and numerical approach. This study permits an in-depth understanding of the temperature fields, together with the frictional heat generation process. Furthermore, by investigating the transient thermal behaviour among different pinion machine-setting parameters, the tilted and extended <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> achieved by adjusting the machine-setting parameters can result in an optimal <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> that produces a uniform temperature field of much lower value, thereby achieving higher efficiency of transmission along with stronger anti-scuffing performance...|$|E
40|$|Systematic {{optimization}} of the <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> {{under load}} {{is an open}} problem {{in the design of}} spiral bevel and hypoid gears. In order to enhance its shape and position, gear engineers have been assisted by numerical tools based on trial-and-error approaches, and/or they have been relying on the expertise of skilled operators. The present paper proposes a fully automatic procedure to optimize the loaded <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>pattern,</b> with the advantage of eventually reducing design time and cost. The main problem was split into two identification subproblems: first, to identify the ease-off topography capable of optimizing the contact pattern; second, to identify the machine-tool setting variations required to obtain such ease-off modifications. Both of them were formulated and solved as unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems. In addition, an original strategy to quickly approximate the <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> under load was conceived. The results obtained were very satisfactory in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational speed. They also suggest that the time required to optimize the contact pattern can be significantly reduced compared with typical time frames. A sound mathematical framework ensures results independent of the practitioner's subjective decision-making process. By defining a proper objective function, the proposed method can also be applied to affect other contact properties, such as to improve the motion graph or to decrease the sensitivity of the transmission to assembly errors. Furthermore, it can be easily adapted to any gear drive by virtue of its systematic and versatile nature. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 3013844...|$|E

The tests were {{in support of a}} Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Technology Reinvestment Program (TRP) to enhance face-gear technology. The tests were conducted in the NASA Glenn spiral-bevel-gear/face-gear test facility. Tests were run at 2300 rpm face gear speed and at loads of 64, 76, 88, 100, and 112 -percent of the design torque of 377 N-m (3340 in-lb). The carburized and ground face gears demonstrated the required durability when run for ten-million cycles at each of the applied loads. Proper installation was critical for the successful operation of the spur pinions and face gears. A large amount of backlash produced <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>patterns</b> that approached the inner-diameter edge of the face-gear tooth.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} in a dental setting to accurately diagnose sleep bruxism and to objectively assess the severity, frequency or {{natural history of}} the condition in an individual patient. Yet this information {{is essential for the}} management of sleep bruxism and to plan appropriate dental treatment. The objective {{of this study was to}} clinically test a device that could be used to record bruxism events in a home environment. Pressure sensors were developed for use under the surface of an occlusal splint, and circuitry was designed to facilitate the recording and wireless transmission of the pressure sensor signal to a computer. Controlled mandibular movements were carried out in vivo to simulate bruxism and non-bruxism patterns. These patterns of force application were graphically presented to two examiners who were asked to identify the type of activity represented by the force curves. Examiners were largely able to distinguish bruxism from non-bruxism activity; the sensitivity ranged from 80 % to 100 % and the specificity from 75 % to 100 %. Using sensors in an occlusal splint, it is possible to recognise the typical <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>patterns</b> seen in sleep bruxism.

In particular, it focuses on the open problem of optimizing the <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> under load in a systematic way.

As a by-product of the method proposed, an original procedure to quickly approximate the <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> under load is presented. The results obtained are very satisfactory in terms of accuracy, robustness and computational speed. The time required to optimize the contact pattern can be reduced from some days to a few hours. In addition, the systematic nature of the proposed method enables to optimize other contact properties simply by defining an adequate objective function. For instance, the method can be applied to optimize the transmission error function, or to reduce the sensitivity of the gear drive to misalignments...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an automatic procedure {{to optimize the}} loaded <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> of face-milled hypoid gears with misalignments varying within prescribed ranges. A two-step ap- proach is proposed to solve the problem: in the first step, the pinion tooth micro-topography is automatically modified to bring the perturbed contact patterns (as the assembly errors are varied within the tolerance limits) match a target area of the tooth, while keeping them off the edges; in the second step, {{a subset of the}} machine-tool settings is identified to obtain the required topog- raphy modifications. Both steps are formulated and solved as un- constrained nonlinear optimization problems. While the general methodology is similar to the one recently proposed by the same authors for the optimization at nominal conditions, here the ro- bustness issues with respect to misalignment variations are con- sidered and directly included in the optimization procedure: no a posteriori check for robustness is therefore required. Numerical tests show that nominally satisfactory and globally robust hypoid pairs can be designed by a direct process and within a unified framework, thus avoiding tiresome trial-and-error loops...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{fatigue tests}} were {{performed}} to determine the surface durability life of a face gear in mesh with a tapered spur involute pinion. Twenty-four sets of gears were tested at three load levels: 7200, 8185, and 9075 lb-in face gear torque, and 2190 to 3280 rpm face gear speed. The gears were carburized and ground, shot-peened and vibro-honed, and made from VIM-VAR Pyrowear 53 steel per AMS 6308. The tests produced 17 gear tooth spalling failures and 7 suspensions. For all the failed sets, spalling occurred {{on at least one}} tooth of all the pinions. In some cases, the spalling initiated a crack in the pinion teeth which progressed to tooth fracture. Also, spalling occurred on some face gear teeth. The AGMA endurance allowable stress for a tapered spur involute pinion in mesh with a face gear was determined to be 275 ksi for the material tested. For the application of a tapered spur involute pinion in mesh with a face gear, proper face gear shim controlled the desired gear <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> while proper pinion shim was an effective way of adjusting backlash without severely affecting the contact pattern...|$|E

The phenomena may or may not occur. In some units the shift is more severe than others and has been observed in cases where there is as little as 16, 000 hours of operation. In other cases {{there is no evidence of}} any change for units in operation for more than 170, 000 hours. This condition has been observed primarily in helical gears. All recorded observations have been with case carburized hardened and ground gear sets. This document describes the phenomena observed among some of many installed high speed gear units in field operation which have been inspected.

The short-term components mainly refer to profile deviation, helix deviation, {{as well as}} pitch deviation and tooth surface modification. Conry and Seireg [1] proposed an evaluation method of load distribution and optimal modifications for cylindrical gears based on flexibility analysis method and elastic contact theory. Kubo and Kiyono [2] investigated the effects {{of different kinds of}} tooth form errors on vibration of spur and helical gear system, and found that convex tooth form error leads to minimum vibration, but concave and waving tooth form error result in relatively stronger vibration. Later, Kubo et al. [3] investigated the relationship between <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> and transmission error of gears having errors, and developed the fast calculation method through observing the actual <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> <b>pattern.</b> Umezawa et al. [4, 5] developed a torsional dynamic model of spur gear system and analyzed the effects of pressure angle error, normal pitch error, and waved form error on vibration of gear system. It is found that the influences of gear errors on system vibration are significant. Vedmar and Andersson [6] developed a dynamic contact model to investigate the dynamic contact characteristics and vibration of spur and helical gears. Mattar and Velex [7, 8] presented an analytical model for calculating mesh stiffness of cylindrical gear using length of contact line, and developed a dynamic contact model to investigate the effects of shape deviations on quasi-static and dynamic behaviors of narrow-faced helical gears. Matsumura et al. [9] developed a torsional dynamic model of helical gear system, and studied the gear errors on system vibration under lighter loading condition. The results showed that the partial contact loss due to gear errors in light loading condition has significant effect on system vibration. Munro et al. [10] presented an approximate formula of transmission error considering corner contact due to manufacturing and assembly errors. Ogawa et al. [11] performed the theoretical and experimental investigations about the dynamic behaviors of a spur gear pair having helix deviation. The results showed that helix deviation will result in decreased mesh stiffness and lead to lower resonance speed. Wei et al. [12] employed the finite element method to analyze the effects of five types of flank deviation on load distribution of helical gears, and found the superposition property of the influences of individual flank deviation on load distribution. Fernández-del-Rincón et al. [13, 14] used a global finite element model and a partial finite element model to develop the TVMS calculation model of spur gears based on flexibility analysis method, and investigated the effects of tooth profile deviation and support flexibility on the dynamic behaviors of spur gear system. Wang et al. [15] employed the thin slice theory and potential energy method to develop the TVMS and contact stress calculation method for helical gears having tooth profile errors. Li [16] developed a finite element method programs to investigate the influences of manufacturing errors, gear misalignment, as well as assembly errors and gear modifications on TVMS of a spur gear pair. Lin and He [17] used the finite element method to determine the static transmission error of a spur gear pair with machining errors, assembly errors and modifications, and then established a bending-torsional-axial coupling dynamic model to calculate the dynamic transmission error.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to estimate the <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> for gear drives. The proposed method {{is based on the}} geometric properties of the generated surfaces of the pinion and the gear and it neglects the mechanical characteristics of the mating members. The key feature of the method is the superimposition of a virtual marking compound over the gear surface that mimics the industrial practice of <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> inspection. For each meshing condition the instantaneous contact area is estimated as the intersection of the pinion surface with the marking compound gear surface. Finally, the <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> is estimated by the convex envelope of all the instantaneous contact areas in the zr-plane. The marking compound shape is identified through an optimization process to match a target <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> obtained, e. g. with an accurate loaded <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> analysis tool. The proposed method has been tested with a dedicated FEM software package capable of producing a very accurate <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> estimation of the <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> under load. Extensive simulations have shown that, once the optimal marking compound shape has been identified, the proposed method computes a reliable <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> even for very different surface geometries (e. g. an ease-off on the pinion surface) and assembly errors. The computational cost of the entire procedure is about two orders of magnitude lower than that required to run the full FEM analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Angle Class I normal occlusions in 85 dental students aged 20 – 29 were evaluated using the T-Scan II occlusal imaging and analysis system. The frequency of occlusal contacts was recorded for right and left lateral excursions at the position of lateral disclusion, at the canine-to-canine position and at the lateral maximal position. At the canine-to-canine position, the occlusal <b>contact</b> <b>patterns</b> were classified, and the relative forces were compared by multiple regression analysis, with α = 0 · 05. At the position of lateral disclusion, {{a high percentage of}} canine contacts (58 · 5 %) and individual posterior <b>tooth</b> <b>contacts</b> on the working side was observed. At the canine-to-canine position, the canines on the working side contacted most frequently (68 · 9 %), and the occlusal <b>contact</b> <b>patterns</b> could be classified into six groups.

In subjects with different types of lateral guidance, intraoral lateral <b>tooth</b> <b>contacts</b> identified with occlusal registration strips were compared with those identified by use of a semi-adjustable articulator, setting the condylar guidance in four different ways: using protrusive wax wafers, by axiography and by adding and subtracting 5 degrees from the value of condylar guidance obtained by protrusive wax wafers. Tolerance to variations of condylar guidance without changing lateral <b>tooth</b> <b>contacts</b> was determined by increasing and decreasing the value of condylar guidance until lateral <b>tooth</b> <b>contacts</b> changed. Different ways of setting condylar guidance on a semi-adjustable articulator give rise to different values of condylar guidance in the same subject.

40|$|This paper gives {{a general}} account of gear dynamic tooth loads and noise. Experimental work in {{progress}} is used to illustrate the steps in a dynamic analysis of a gear system. The nature and specification of the excitation sources at the <b>tooth</b> <b>contact,</b> and the generation of <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> frequency components and of their sidebands for spur and helical gearing are described, together with the vibrational and acoustic responses and the correlation between excitation and response. The analysis indicates how control of dynamic load and noise can be achieved...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} vessel spatio-temporal <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> {{detection}} algorithm based on MapReduce called VSTP {{and analyze the}} vessel <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> including inter-contact time distribution [10 – 12], contact times distribution and so on. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first systematic vessel spatio-temporal <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> detection strategy in the ocean communication field. And it is the first paper about vessel spatio-temporal <b>contact</b> <b>pattern</b> detection with real data in this field.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to define optimal tooth modifications, {{introduced}} by appropriately chosen head-cutter geometry and machine tool setting, to simultaneously minimize <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> pressure and angular displacement error of the driven gear (transmission error) of face-hobbed spiral bevel gears. As a result of these modifications, the gear pair becomes mismatched, and a point contact replaces the theoretical line contact. In the applied loaded <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> analysis it is assumed that the point contact under load is spreading over a surface along the whole or part of the “potential” contact line. A computer program was developed to implement the formulation provided above. By using this program the influence of tooth modifications introduced by the variation in machine tool settings and in head cutter data on load and pressure distributions, transmission errors, and fillet stresses is investigated and discussed. The correlation between the ease-off obtained by pinion tooth modifications and the corresponding <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> pressure distribution is investigated and the obtained results are presented...|$|R
