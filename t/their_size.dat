5|$|Threskiornithidae is {{a family}} of large {{terrestrial}} and wading birds which includes the ibises and spoonbills. They have long, broad wings with 11 primary and about 20 secondary feathers. They are strong fliers and despite <b>their</b> <b>size</b> and weight, very capable soarers.|$|E

5|$|An {{additional}} {{solution was}} to fit twin balanced rudders behind each inner shaft, {{in contrast to the}} single central rudder used on earlier ships.

5|$|Beginning in the 1980s, {{improvements}} in technology {{led to a}} greatly increased number, variety, and performance of commercially available communication devices, {{and a reduction in}} <b>their</b> <b>size</b> and price. Alternative methods of access such as Target Scanning (also known as eye pointing) calibrate the movement of a user's eyes to direct an SGD to produce the desired speech phase. Scanning, in which alternatives are presented to the user sequentially, became available on communication devices. Speech output possibilities included both digitized and synthesized speech.|$|E

5|$|Cestodes have no mouths or guts, and the syncitial skin absorbs {{nutrients}} – mainly {{carbohydrates and}} amino acids – from the host, and also disguises it chemically to avoid attacks by the host's immune system. Shortage of carbohydrates in the host's diet stunts {{the growth of}} the parasites and kills some. Their metabolisms generally use simple but inefficient chemical processes, and they compensate by consuming large amounts of food relative to <b>their</b> <b>size.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1910, Eaton {{became the}} first {{scientist}} to publish a more {{detailed description of the}} entire Pteranodon skeleton, as it was known at the time. He used his findings to revise the classification of the genus once again based on {{a better understanding of the}} differences in pteranodont anatomy. Eaton conducted experiments using clay models of bones to help determine the effects of crushing and flattening on the shapes of the arm bones Williston had used in his own classification. Eaton found that most of the differences in bone shapes could be easily explained by the pressures of fossilization, and concluded that no Pteranodon skeletons had any significant differences from each other besides <b>their</b> <b>size.</b> Therefore, Eaton was left to decide his classification scheme based on differences in the skulls alone, which he assigned to species just as Marsh did, by <b>their</b> <b>size.</b> In the end, Eaton recognized only three valid species: P. occidentalis, P. ingens, and P. longiceps.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} appear brown. Viewing {{them with a}} light {{microscope}} reveals finer details of their structure: they are roughly spherical but end abruptly in a small point, their surfaces are covered with small, wart-like nodules, and <b>their</b> <b>size</b> is between 5.0–5.3 by 4.0–4.7µm. The spores are in amyloid, meaning they do not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent.|$|E

Methods mathematical modeling theory of dimensions processing statistical data. 	Results basing on differential equations describing the national economy with the account of economical environment resistance two dimensionless criteria are obtained which allow to compare economies regardless of <b>their</b> <b>sizes.</b> With the theory of dimensions we show that the obtained indices are not accidental.

Scientific novelty the dimensionless criteria are obtained ndash economic indices which allow to compare economies regardless of <b>their</b> <b>sizes</b> and to analyze the dynamic changes in the economies with time. 	nbsp 	Practical significance the obtained results can be used for dynamic and comparative analysis of different countriesrsquo economies regardless of <b>their</b> <b>sizes...</b>|$|R

5|$|Like other newts, Triturus {{species are}} {{carnivorous}} and feed mainly on invertebrates. During the land phase, prey include earthworms and other annelids, different insects, woodlice, and snails and slugs. During the breeding season, they prey on various aquatic invertebrates, and also tadpoles of other amphibians {{such as the}} common frog or common toad, and smaller newts. Larvae, depending on <b>their</b> <b>size,</b> eat small invertebrates and tadpoles, and also smaller larvae of their own species.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{this family}} have long, broad wings, are strong fliers and, rather surprisingly, given <b>their</b> <b>size</b> and weight, very capable soarers. The body tends to be elongated, the neck more so, with rather long legs. The bill is also long, decurved {{in the case of}} the ibises, {{straight}} and distinctively flattened in the spoonbills.|$|E
5|$|Musical {{instrument}} classification is a discipline {{in its own}} right, and many systems of classification have been used over the years. Instruments can be classified by their effective range, their material composition, <b>their</b> <b>size,</b> etc. However, the most common academic method, Hornbostel-Sachs, uses {{the means by which}} they produce sound. The academic study of musical instruments is called organology.|$|E

5|$|On 9 October 1531, in a {{surprise}} move, the Five States {{declared war on}} Zurich. Zurich's mobilisation was slow due to internal squabbling and on 11 October, 3500 poorly deployed men encountered a Five States force nearly double <b>their</b> <b>size</b> near Kappel. Many pastors, including Zwingli, were among the soldiers. The battle lasted less than one hour and Zwingli was among the 500 casualties in the Zurich army.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have {{an unusually}} low basal {{metabolic}} rate, about 40% {{of the typical}} value for placental mammals of <b>their</b> <b>size,</b> {{comparable to that of}} sloths. Since they consume a relatively high-calorie diet that is available year-round, it has been proposed that this slow metabolism is due primarily to the need to eliminate toxic compounds from their food. For example, slow lorises can feed on Gluta bark, which may be fatal to humans.|$|E

5|$|The Sunda Strait and {{surrounding}} waters remained an important strategic location throughout the war, although the subsequent organisation of East Indiamen into convoys {{and the return}} of a Royal Navy presence in the region assisted in limiting losses to French privateers and smaller warships.

5|$|The ancient Peruvian Moche people worshipped {{the sea and}} its animals. Their art often depicts manta rays. Historically, mantas were {{feared for}} <b>their</b> <b>size</b> and power.
