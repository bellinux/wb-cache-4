5000|$|The burner {{is a small}} brass cup {{that looks}} and {{functions}} similar to a beverage-can stove. Fuel is poured into the burner and ignited. The heat from the flame causes the fuel to vaporize, forcing it out of 23 or 24 jets {{around the top of}} the burner, and producing a steady cooking flame. The burner includes a removable [...] "simmer ring", which partially blocks the flame in order to reduce heat output and <b>threaded</b> <b>lid.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In 1858, Mason {{invented a}} square-shouldered jar with <b>threaded</b> screw-top, {{matching}} <b>lid,</b> and rubber ring for an airtight seal - the Mason jar. Until the 1830s, long before refrigeration and hothouse gardens, many {{fruits and vegetables}} had been available only seasonally, but the recent development of jars had made canning a practical alternative to drying, pickling, or smoking to preserve food.|$|R
50|$|The cooling of the {{contents}} creates a vacuum in the head space, pulling the lid into tight contact with the jar rim to create a hermetic seal. Once cooled, the band is removed to prevent residual water between the jar <b>threads</b> and the <b>lid</b> from rusting the band. If the jar seal is properly formed, internal vacuum will keep the lid tightly on the jar. Most metal lids used today are slightly domed {{to serve as a}} seal status indicator. The vacuum in a properly sealed mason jar pulls the lid down to create a concave-shaped dome. An improper or failed seal or microbial growth will cause the dome to pop upward.|$|R
40|$|In {{the fall}} of 2010, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) {{contracted}} with vendors to design and build 6 CVS containment vessels {{as part of their}} effort to ship Fuel Derived Mixed Fission Product material. The 6 CVS design is based on the Savannah River National Laboratory's (SRNL) design for 9975 and 9977 six inch diameter containment vessels. The main difference between the designs is that the 6 CVS credits the inner O-ring seal as the containment boundary while the SRNL design credits the outer O-ring seal. Since the leak test must be done with the inner O-ring in place, the containment vessel does not have a pathway for getting the helium into the vessel during the leak test. The leak testing contractor was not able to get acceptable leak rates with the specified O-ring, but they were able to pass the leak test with a slightly larger O-ring. ANL asked the SRNL to duplicate the leak test vendor's method to determine the cause of the high leak rates. The SRNL testing showed that the helium leak indications were caused by residual helium left within the 6 CVS Closure Assembly by the leak test technique, and by helium permeation through the Viton O-ring seals. After SRNL completed their tests, the leak testing contractor was able to measure acceptable leak rates by using the slightly larger O-ring size, by purging helium from the <b>lid</b> <b>threads,</b> and by being very quick in getting the bell jar under a full vacuum. This paper describes the leak test vendor's test technique, and other techniques that could be have been used to successfully leak test the 6 CVS's...|$|R
