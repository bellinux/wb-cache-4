5|$|A {{species of}} sphenodontine is {{known from the}} Miocene Saint Bathans Fauna. Whether it is refereable to Sphenodon proper is not entirely clear, but {{is assumed to be}} closely related to <b>tuataras.</b>|$|E
5|$|The two living non-archosaurian reptile taxa, {{testudines}} (turtles) and lepidosaurians (lizards and <b>tuataras),</b> {{along with}} choristoderes (semi-aquatic archosauromorphs that would die {{out in the}} early Miocene), survived across the K–Pg boundary. More than 80% of Cretaceous turtle species passed through the K–Pg boundary. Additionally, all six turtle families in existence {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous survived into the Paleogene and are represented by living species. Living lepidosaurs include the <b>tuataras</b> (the only living rhynchocephalians) and the squamates. The rhynchocephalians were a widespread and relatively successful group of lepidosaurians during the early Mesozoic, but began to decline by the mid-Cretaceous, although they were very successful in the Late Cretaceous of South America. They are represented today by a single genus, located exclusively in New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The lungs of most {{reptiles}} have {{a single}} bronchus running down the centre, from which numerous branches reach out to individual pockets throughout the lungs. These pockets are similar to alveoli in mammals, but much larger and fewer in number. These give the lung a sponge-like texture. In <b>tuataras,</b> snakes, and some lizards, the lungs are simpler in structure, {{similar to that of}} typical amphibians.|$|E

5|$|Burrowing seabirds such as petrels, prions, and shearwaters {{share the}} <b>tuatara's</b> island habitat during the birds' nesting seasons. The <b>tuatara</b> use the birds' burrows for shelter when available, or dig their own. The seabirds' guano helps to {{maintain}} invertebrate populations on which <b>tuatara</b> predominantly prey; including beetles, crickets, and spiders. Their diets also consist of frogs, lizards, and bird's eggs and chicks. The eggs and young of seabirds that are seasonally available as food for <b>tuatara</b> may provide beneficial fatty acids. <b>Tuatara</b> {{of both sexes}} defend territories, and will threaten and eventually bite intruders. The bite can cause serious injury. <b>Tuatara</b> will bite when approached, and will not let go easily.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of human {{introduced}} predators, weta were hunted by <b>tuatara,</b> lizards, short-tailed bats and birds. Even today, scientists like Meads and Notman have seen <b>tuatara</b> take Deinacrida wetas. Weta remains have been frequently discovered in <b>tuatara</b> faecal pellets.|$|R
5|$|<b>Tuataras</b> superficially {{resemble}} lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) {{on either}} side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down. The brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles, and the lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchi. The tuatara has a well-developed parietal eye on its forehead.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{presence}} of an embryo per se would be equivocal regarding this issue, the conditions in which the embryo were preserved provide strong evidence that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous. There is no preserved calcified eggshell surrounding the embryo, despite {{the presence}} of delicately-preserved calcified elements from other animals at Luoping. This is consistent with the eggshells surrounding the embryos of viviparous reptiles being non-calcified membranes. Furthermore, the relative proportions of the humerus and the fibula in the embryo, compared with the maternal individual and IVPP V13898 from Panxian, indicate that the embryo is around 12% of the size of its mother. Combined with its ossified bones, this suggests that the embryo was at an advanced developmental stage, whereas crocodilians, birds, turtles, and <b>tuataras</b> lay eggs at very early developmental stages.|$|E
5|$|There are {{fourteen}} extant {{families of}} the order Testudines, an order of reptile commonly known as turtles, tortoises and terrapins. The testudines {{are some of the}} most ancient reptiles alive, with only the <b>tuataras</b> considered more primitive. There are approximately 300 extant species and 97 genera of testudines, split into two suborders: the Cryptodirans and the Pleurodirans. The distinction between these two suborders is based on the mode in which they cover their head and neck. The Pleurodirans, also called the side-necked turtles, have long necks, and fold them sideways to align them with the shell. The Pelomedusidae and Chelidae are the only extant families of pleurodires. The Cryptodirans pull their neck straight back to conceal their head within the shell. The Carettochelyidae, Cheloniidae, Chelydridae, Dermatemydidae, Dermochelyidae, Emydidae, Kinosternidae, Testudinidae and Trionychidae are all cryptodires, although the ability to retract the head has been lost in the sea turtles (Cheloniidae and Dermochelyidae). A third order, the Paracryptodirans, are extinct.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tuatara</b> {{feature in}} a number of {{indigenous}} legends, and are held as ariki (God forms). <b>Tuatara</b> are regarded as the messengers of Whiro, the god of death and disaster, and Māori women are forbidden to eat them. <b>Tuatara</b> also indicate tapu (the borders of what is sacred and restricted), beyond which there is mana, meaning there could be serious consequences if that boundary is crossed. Māori women would sometimes tattoo images of lizards, some of which may represent <b>tuatara,</b> near their genitals. Today, <b>tuatara</b> are regarded as a taonga (special treasure).|$|R
5|$|The <b>tuatara's</b> greenish brown colour matches its environment, and {{can change}} over its lifetime. <b>Tuatara</b> shed their skin {{at least once}} per year as adults, and {{three or four times}} a year as juveniles. <b>Tuatara</b> sexes differ in more than size. The spiny crest on a <b>tuatara's</b> back, made of triangular, soft folds of skin, is larger in males, and can be {{stiffened}} for display. The male abdomen is narrower than the female's.|$|R
500|$|While {{there is}} {{currently}} considered to be only one living species of <b>tuatara,</b> two species were previously identified: Sphenodon punctatus, or Northern <b>tuatara,</b> and the much rarer Sphenodon guntheri, or Brothers Island <b>tuatara,</b> which is confined to North Brother Island in Cook Strait. The specific name punctatus is Latin for [...] "spotted", and guntheri refers to German-born British herpetologist Albert Günther. A 2009 paper re-examined the genetic bases used to distinguish the two supposed species of <b>tuatara,</b> and concluded they only represent geographic variants, and only one species should be recognized. Consequently, the Northern <b>tuatara</b> is now classified as Sphenodon punctatus punctatus and the Brothers Island <b>tuatara</b> as Sphenodon punctatus guntheri. The Brothers Island <b>tuatara</b> has olive brown skin with yellowish patches, while the colour of the Northern <b>tuatara</b> ranges from olive green through grey to dark pink or brick red, often mottled, and always with white spots. In addition, the Brothers Island variant is considerably smaller. [...] An extinct species of Sphenodon was identified in November 1885 by William Colenso, who was sent an incomplete sub-fossil specimen from a local coal mine. Colenso named the new species S. diversum.|$|R
5|$|Reptiles are a {{class of}} animals {{comprising}} turtles, <b>tuataras,</b> lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian {{but there is a}} septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.|$|E
25|$|Early in the period, {{the modern}} reptiles, or crown-group reptiles, evolved and {{split into two}} main lineages: the Archosauromorpha (forebears of turtles, crocodiles, and dinosaurs) and the Lepidosauromorpha (predecessors of modern lizards and <b>tuataras).</b> Both groups {{remained}} lizard-like and relatively small and inconspicuous during the Permian.|$|E
25|$|During {{embryonic}} development, the parietal {{eye and the}} pineal {{organ of}} modern lizards and <b>tuataras</b> form together from a pocket formed in the brain ectoderm. The loss of parietal eyes in many living tetrapods is supported by developmental formation of a paired structure that subsequently fuses into a single pineal gland in developing embryos of turtles, snakes, birds, and mammals.|$|E
5|$|The WildNZ Trust has a <b>tuatara</b> {{breeding}} enclosure at Ruawai. One notable captive breeding {{success story}} {{took place in}} January 2009, when all 11 eggs belonging to 110-year-old <b>tuatara</b> Henry and 80-year-old <b>tuatara</b> Mildred hatched. This story is especially remarkable as Henry required surgery to remove a cancerous tumour in order to successfully breed.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, SSC North America {{announced}} {{they were going}} to produce a limited number of SSC Ultimate Aero XT's. This vehicle was an upgraded Ultimate Aero and included many features from the <b>Tuatara.</b> These features include a 1,300 horsepower version of the <b>Tuatara</b> twin-turbo charged V8, a 7-speed <b>Tuatara</b> paddle shifter transmission, and upgrade cooling, fuel, and braking systems.|$|R
5|$|<b>Tuatara</b> {{were once}} {{widespread}} on New Zealand's main North and South Islands, where subfossil remains {{have been found}} in sand dunes, caves, and Māori middens. Wiped out from the main islands before European settlement, they were long confined to 32offshore islands free of mammals. The islands are difficult to get to, and are colonised by few animal species, indicating that some animals absent from these islands may have caused <b>tuatara</b> to disappear from the mainland. However, kiore (Polynesian rats) had recently become established on several of the islands, and <b>tuatara</b> were persisting, but not breeding, on these islands. Additionally, <b>tuatara</b> were much rarer on the rat-inhabited islands. Prior to conservation work, 25% of the total <b>tuatara</b> population had become extinct in the past century.|$|R
25|$|The sister {{group to}} Archosauromorpha is Lepidosauromorpha, {{containing}} lizards and <b>tuataras,</b> {{as well as}} their fossil relatives. Lepidosauromorpha contained at least one major group of the Mesozoic sea reptiles: the mosasaurs, which lived during the Cretaceous period. The phylogenetic placement of other main groups of fossil sea reptiles – the ichthyopterygians (including ichthyosaurs) and the sauropterygians, which evolved in the early Triassic – is more controversial. Different authors linked these groups either to lepidosauromorphs or to archosauromorphs, and ichthyopterygians were also argued to be diapsids that did not belong to the least inclusive clade containing lepidosauromorphs and archosauromorphs.|$|E
25|$|The general {{structure}} of human vertebrae is fairly typical of {{that found in}} mammals, reptiles, and birds. The shape of the vertebral body does, however, vary somewhat between different groups. In mammals, such as humans, it typically has flat upper and lower surfaces, while in reptiles the anterior surface commonly has a concave socket into which the expanded convex face of the next vertebral body fits. Even these patterns are only generalisations, however, {{and there may be}} variation in form of the vertebrae {{along the length of the}} spine even within a single species. Some unusual variations include the saddle-shaped sockets between the cervical vertebrae of birds and the presence of a narrow hollow canal running down the centre of the vertebral bodies of geckos and <b>tuataras,</b> containing a remnant of the notochord.|$|E
500|$|The main {{distinguishing}} {{characteristic of}} diapsid tetrapods {{is the presence}} of two openings (temporal fenestrae) {{on either side of the}} skull behind the eye. Living diapsids include all crocodilians, lizards, snakes, <b>tuataras,</b> and birds. The feature that distinguishes archosaurs from other diapsids is an extra pair of openings in the skull (antorbital fenestrae) in front of the eye sockets. Archosauria is the crown group containing the most recent common ancestor of crocodilians and birds and all its descendants. It comprises the Pseudosuchia, the [...] "false crocodiles", and the Ornithosuchia, which in turn comprises the dinosaurs and their relatives, the pterosaurs and the birds. Pseudosuchia is defined as living crocodilians and all archosaurs more closely related to crocodilians than to birds. The Pseudosuchia–bird split is assumed to have occurred close to the Permian–Triassic mass extinction event. In modern crocodilians, the antorbital fenestrae are walled off externally and exist as merely as sinuses. They were present in most of their fossil ancestors as small openings.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>tuatara</b> {{breeding}} programmes are active within New Zealand. Southland Museum and Art Gallery in Invercargill {{was the first}} institution to have a <b>tuatara</b> breeding programme; they breed S. punctatus.|$|R
50|$|Chris <b>Tuatara</b> {{was born}} in Hastings, New Zealand. He was raised by his mother Moana <b>Tuatara</b> and moved with her to Sydney, Australia, {{when he was a}} young boy. He did not know the {{identity}} of his father, Howard Morrison Jnr (son of the entertainer Sir Howard Morrison), until he was 13 years old. Later as an adult, Chris <b>Tuatara</b> changed his name to Chris Tuatara-Morrison.|$|R
5|$|<b>Tuatara,</b> {{along with}} other, now extinct {{members of the}} order Sphenodontia, belong to the {{superorder}} Lepidosauria, the only surviving taxon within Lepidosauromorpha. Squamates and <b>tuatara</b> both show caudal autotomy (loss of the tail-tip when threatened), and have transverse cloacal slits. The origin of the <b>tuatara</b> probably lies close to the split between the Lepidosauromorpha and the Archosauromorpha. Though <b>tuatara</b> resemble lizards, the similarity is superficial, because the family has several characteristics unique among reptiles. The typical lizard shape is very common for the early amniotes; the oldest known fossil of a reptile, the Hylonomus, resembles a modern lizard.|$|R
2500|$|The Tropical Realm is {{also the}} centre of the reptile collection. The {{crocodile}} pools (which formerly housed West African dwarf crocodiles, American alligators and Philippine crocodiles) currently house spectacled caimans in one and white-winged wood ducks and a yellow-Faced myna in the other. Near the entrance is an enclosure for <b>tuataras.</b> This lizard-like species from New Zealand is the last surviving sphenodont, a prehistoric group of reptiles, and Chester is the only British zoo to exhibit them. In February 2016, a tuatara hatched for the first time outside of New Zealand, leading Chester Zoo to be the only zoo to have bred them anywhere else. There were many varieties of snakes and lizards in the past (many had to depart as a result) emerald tree boas and Moellendorf's Ratsnakes now being the only remaining. The lizard collection is now made up of Serrated Casquehead Iguanas, Graham's Anoles, Jamaican Anoles, caiman lizards, and a Parson's chameleon.|$|E

40|$|The <b>tuatara</b> of New Zealand is {{a unique}} reptile that coexisted with dinosaurs and has changed little morphologically from its Cretaceous relatives. <b>Tuatara</b> have very slow {{metabolic}} and growth rates, long generation times and slow rates of reproduction. This suggests that the species is likely to exhibit a very slow rate of molecular evolution. Our analysis of ancient and modern <b>tuatara</b> DNA shows that, surprisingly, <b>tuatara</b> have {{the highest rate of}} molecular change recorded in vertebrates. Our work also suggests that rates of neutral molecular and phenotypic evolution are decoupled. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|<b>Tuatara,</b> {{along with}} other, now extinct {{members of the}} order Sphenodontia, belong to the {{superorder}} Lepidosauria, the only surviving taxon within Lepidosauromorpha.

5000|$|Climate {{change has}} led to the need for {{conservation}} efforts to protect the existence of the <b>tuatara.</b> This is because it is not possible for this species to migrate on its own to cooler areas. Conservationists are beginning to consider the possibility of translocating them to islands with cooler climates. The range of the <b>tuatara</b> has already been minimized by the introduction of cats, rats, dogs, and mustelids to New Zealand. The [...] of the mammals from the islands where the <b>tuatara</b> still survives has helped the species increase its population. An experiment observing the <b>tuatara</b> population after the removal of the Polynesian rat showed that the <b>tuatara</b> expressed an island-specific increase of population after the rats' removal. However, {{it may be difficult to}} keep these small mammals from reinhabiting these islands.|$|R

50|$|Lepidosauromorpha is a {{group of}} {{reptiles}} comprising all diapsids closer to lizards than to archosaurs (which include crocodiles and birds). The only living sub-group is the Lepidosauria: extant lizards, snakes, amphisbaenians and <b>tuataras.</b>|$|E
50|$|Late in the period, the diapsid {{reptiles}} {{split into}} two main lineages, the archosaurs (ancestors of crocodiles and dinosaurs) and the lepidosaurs (predecessors of modern <b>tuataras,</b> lizards, and snakes). Both groups remained lizard-like and relatively small and inconspicuous during the Permian.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tuatara</b> spine {{is made up}} of hourglass-shaped amphicoelous vertebrae, concave {{both before}} and behind. This is the usual {{condition}} of fish vertebrae and some amphibians, but is unique to <b>tuatara</b> within the amniotes.|$|R
40|$|Scientific {{investigation}} of the sensory world and behavior of the <b>tuatara</b> is limited. This study incorporates both ecological and psychological perspectives to test learning and visual perception using a novel operant technique and flicker-fusion rates to measure visual discrimination in <b>tuatara.</b> We posed four main questions: (1) can a reliable method examine learning and visual perception in <b>tuatara?,</b> (2) what is the critical flicker-fusion (CFF) rates for <b>tuatara</b> {{and how does it}} relate to motion detection ability?, (3) can stimulus control be transferred to a Y-maze from an open field arena?, and (4) what are the implications for behavioral ecology, conservation, and species welfare? <b>Tuatara</b> (Sphenodon punctatus) were trained using an operant conditioning procedure with food reinforcement to respond to discriminative stimuli (S+) of various flicker-fusion rates, and ignore a non-discriminative stimulus (S-). <b>Tuatara</b> discriminated CFF rates between 2. 65 - 45. 61 Hz, but not at 65. 09 Hz. The upper threshold between 45. 61 - 65. 09 Hz is comparable to other mammalian, avian, and herpetological species. <b>Tuatara</b> demonstrated a learning capacity for acquisition of an operant task as well as cognitive development for learning and memory strategies. Visual discrimination is important to <b>tuatara</b> and may facilitate behavioral responses to many context-dependent ecological processes (i. e., predator/prey/kin recognition, mate selection, environmental discrimination, optimal foraging strategies, and communication). By understanding the importance of visual stimuli, the study provides a better perspective of the <b>tuatara</b> natural sensory world. Additionally, a reliable method was established {{that can be used for}} more comprehensive psychophysical experiments to further access visual perception and learning in all reptiles, with the potential to examine other sensory mechanisms such as audition, chemoreception, and tactility...|$|R
5|$|<b>Tuatara</b> {{have been}} {{referred}} to as living fossils, which means they retain many basal characteristics from {{around the time of the}} squamate – rhynchocephalian split (220 MYA). However, taxonomic work on Sphenodontia has shown this group has undergone a variety of changes throughout the Mesozoic, and a March 2008 molecular study showed their rate of molecular evolution has been the fastest of any animal yet examined. Many of the niches occupied by lizards today were then held by sphenodontians. There was even a successful group of aquatic sphenodontians known as pleurosaurs, which differed markedly from living <b>tuatara.</b> <b>Tuatara</b> show cold weather adaptations that allow them to thrive on the islands of New Zealand; these adaptations may be unique to <b>tuatara</b> since their sphenodontian ancestors lived in the much warmer climates of the Mesozoic. For instance, Palaeopleurosaurus appears to have had a much shorter lifespan compared to the modern <b>tuatara.</b>|$|R
