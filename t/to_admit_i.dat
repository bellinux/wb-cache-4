500|$|Reception of Marvel Trading Card Game {{across all}} three {{platforms}} was mixed. [...] The game {{was compared to}} other collectible card games such as Pokémon, Magic, and Munchkin. [...] Reviewers were pleased with the game's representation of the VS System rules, but {{felt that it was}} less accessible to players who weren't familiar with the physical version. [...] Several reviews referred to the gameplay as addictive; IGN's Hilary Goldstein said [...] "I have <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> <b>I</b> am somewhat addicted to the Marvel Trading Card Game. It's not a great game by any measure, but it does an excellent job of tapping into the collector's mentality of comic-book fans." ...|$|E
500|$|Only {{two songs}} [...] "Vacant" [...] and [...] "Potions", {{have ever been}} {{identified}} as Tapeworm songs. Neither have been released, though cover versions by Maynard James Keenan's other projects have surfaced. The first, [...] "Vacant" [...] was initially conceived during the Tapeworm sessions; the track being written by Lohner and re-arranged by Clouser, with lyrics and melody by Keenan and chorus and backing vocals by Reznor. The song was first performed live by A Perfect Circle throughout their 2001 tour. MTV reported that Reznor was apparently not happy that Keenan performed the song: [...] "I have <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>I</b> find it mildly irritating for [...] "Vacant" [...] to debut in this fashion before feeling it has been properly realized," [...] Shortly after {{the dissolution of the}} Tapeworm project, Keenan released a reworked version on A Perfect Circle's 2004 cover album Emotive under the title [...] "Passive".|$|E
500|$|Nick Campbell of TV.com {{felt that}} the episode was [...] "a decent if uneven {{penultimate}} episode that gave us {{one last look at}} this quirky group of people in their office environment". He was largely happy with the return of the fun-loving version of Jim, noting that [...] "Pam mentioned that she loves 'Goofy Jim' and I, [...] have <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> <b>I</b> love Goofy Jim myself". Campbell {{felt that the}} episode dabbled in fan service, but that it was expected and needed for the show to have a successful ending. Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode an 8.5 out of 10, denoting a [...] "great" [...] episode. She wrote that [...] "The interplay between Jim, Dwight, and Pam has been the core of the series since Michael Scott's departure, and it was good to see the trio front and center once again as The Office comes to a close." [...] Furthermore, Cornet was happy with Dwight's proposal and the dance party that signaled Darryl's leaving, calling the latter [...] "a slice of bliss".|$|E

2500|$|Regarding {{most people}} not knowing {{she is the}} actual artist of the artwork, Ward stated: And who am I going to tell that I am behind the artwork? I don’t think most people {{think about all the}} work that happens behind the scenes. And it should be that way. The viewers should be caught up in the show. Anyway, it doesn’t come up much. I do have a niece who thinks it’s pretty cool. And I {{impressed}} a bunch of third-graders at career day at my daughter’s school. But they were much more excited by the work I did for the [...] Go figure...And drawing for [...] was exceptional. It wasn’t just a one-time gig for a movie that is out in theaters for a couple weeks. It was ongoing and evolving. Although I {{had nothing to do with}} the concepts behind Peyton’s art, and her drawings are a tiny part of the show, I have <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>I</b> have loved hearing that people out there have connected with the artwork. I have received e-mails from [...] fans who say they love to draw and the artwork on the show is really important to them. How cool is that?! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Perhaps a greater," [...] {{returned}} Tom. [...] "I have no wish {{to enter}} into comparisons, but I'm quite prepared <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that <b>I</b> am as bad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Richard," [...] he said, gently, [...] "there is one without, who pines <b>to</b> be <b>admitted.</b> <b>I</b> {{have refused}} even his tears, under the {{impression}} that you felt disposed to sleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly!" [...] he {{answered}} smoothly. [...] "I am free <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that <b>I</b> am a puzzle to myself. I find myself, in fact, a most interesting study." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' he continued, with interest, 'that is {{the class}} o' subject, I'm bound <b>to</b> <b>admit!</b> <b>I</b> like {{the look of}} the place; it is truly as {{suitable}} for the cure as any I ever saw. 'Twas a knowing-man that sent 'ee, whoever he was.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't owe Jim much; if he {{had stopped}} in Canada, Langrigg would have been yours and mine. Then it begins {{to look as if}} Bernard {{approved}} the fellow, and I'm willing <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>I</b> had rather counted on getting a good share of his money. You and Evelyn would have got the rest." ...|$|E
60|$|Nobody showed {{sympathy for}} the unfortunate Greek. He was bundled out upon Number Two hatch like so much carrion and left there unattended, to recover {{consciousness}} as he might elect. Yes, and so inured have I become that I make free <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>I</b> felt no sympathy for him myself. My eyes were still filled with {{the beauty of the}} Elsinore. One does grow hard at sea.|$|E

60|$|That was a puzzler, and <b>I</b> had <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> it. <b>I</b> didn't {{know how}} much time had elapsed and neither did Perry, for time is nonexistent in Pellucidar.|$|R

6000|$|... “No,” said Nettie with {{a curious}} naive gravity. “I’m quite open <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>I</b> don’t {{know much about}} angels—I’ve only seen {{pictures}} of them. Still, I sometimes think there’s a little of their nature {{in the hearts of}} men. That man must have had it, and the Palliser who was killed in Africa had it too. Of course, that’s not the kind of talk you would expect from an American.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have, Mr. Tait," [...] the {{superintendent}} answered anxiously. [...] "And Sir Theophilus and I {{have been trying}} to fit them upon the coin in the Museum shelves; and I am bound <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>I</b> quite agree with him that they must have been cut off a specimen decidedly larger in one diameter and smaller in another than the existing one--in short, that they do not fit the clipped Wulfric now in the Museum." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I could," [...] Brown took it {{upon himself}} to reply; [...] "but, before doing so, I should wish for an {{introduction}} to the friend who told you the story. Speaking generally," [...] he continued, [...] "it {{seems to me that the}} difference between what we call the natural and the supernatural is merely the difference between frequency and rarity of occurrence. Having regard to the phenomena we are compelled <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> <b>I</b> think it illogical to disbelieve anything we are unable to disprove." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What could {{an unfortunate}} man answer?" [...] he {{asked with a}} mirthless smile. [...] "Do you expect me <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that <b>I</b> am pleased to {{consider}} it is so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's hard <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> but <b>I</b> believe you're right!" [...] Then {{his mind}} leaped {{to a wider}} conclusion. [...] "I dare say the Company was started solely for Hathersage's benefit!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “ ‘I have <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> sir,’ <b>I</b> said, ‘that I entirely {{overlooked}} that. I {{am quite}} conscious that my conduct was indefensible, but I have certainly paid very heavily for it.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|Vergil Gunch thundered, [...] "When {{we manage}} to grab this celebrated Thespian off his lovely {{aggregation}} of beautiful actresses--and I got <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>I</b> butted right into his dressing-room {{and told him}} how the Boosters appreciated the high-class artistic performance he's giving us--and don't forget that the treasurer of the Dodsworth is a Booster and will appreciate our patronage--and when {{on top of that}} we yank Hizzonor out of his multifarious duties at City Hall, then I feel we've done ourselves proud, and Mr. Prout will now say a few words about the problems and duties--" ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{question}} may break us up. Bright is thin-skinned; the attacks [...] in the Lords ruffle {{him more than}} he chooses <b>to</b> <b>admit.</b> <b>I</b> cannot [...] make out how far he likes office, the cabinet, and his new [...] position. It will be particularly disagreeable to him to have this [...] plan, {{of which he is}} so much enamoured and for which he has [...] received so much blame and a little praise, snuffed out by the [...] cabinet. And yet how is it possible to avoid it, even putting [...] aside the strong opinions of Lowe, Cardwell, and others? My only [...] hope is that you have got the germ of some larger and more [...] comprehensive plan in your head, than has yet been developed.|$|E
6000|$|Having cleared this {{specimen}} of Mr. Gladstone's controversial method {{out of the}} way, I may proceed to the next assault, that on a passage in an article on Agnosticism ("Nineteenth Century," [...] February 1889), published two years ago. I there said, in referring to the Gadarene story, [...] "Everything I know of law and justice convinces me that the wanton destruction of other people's property is a misdemeanour of evil example." [...] On this, Mr. Gladstone, continuing his candid and urbane observations, remarks ("Impregnable Rock," [...] p. 273) that, [...] "Exercising his rapid judgment on the text," [...] and [...] "not inquiring what anybody else had known or said about it," [...] I had missed a point in support of that [...] "accusation against our Lord" [...] which he has now been constrained <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>I</b> never made.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{had felt}} {{inclined}} to do so, you would scarcely expect me <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> it? <b>I</b> don't mean {{because that would}} not have been complimentary to you," [...] he said.|$|R
25|$|I used {{to write}} things praising 'The Captain' and now I write {{pretty much the same}} thing, but praising Ceaușescu. I'm not a Marxist, you understand, but <b>I</b> have <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that <b>I</b> like what he's doing.|$|R
6000|$|She {{nodded her}} head reflectively. [...] "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I was right. I think you ought <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that <b>I</b> am a good judge of human nature--at least, in some people and under certain circumstances." ...|$|R
6000|$|You did not {{pronounce}} {{an opinion}} {{in favour of}} a specified [...] franchise; but is there any essential difference between naming a [...] six pound franchise and naming the additional numbers which a six [...] pound franchise was calculated <b>to</b> <b>admit?</b> <b>I</b> {{am not going to}} perform [...] the duty which Whiteside assigned to me of answering your speech, [...] but, if you will not take it amiss, I would say, that it was more [...] like the sort of speech with which Bright would have introduced [...] the Reform bill which he would like to propose, than the sort of [...] speech which might have been expected from the treasury bench in [...] the present state of things. Your speech may win Lancashire for [...] you, though that is doubtful, but I fear it will tend to lose [...] England for you.|$|E
60|$|She could appear, at times, he says, {{as real as}} you or I, {{and again}} came mystery all about her. There were times when {{it seemed to him}} you might have hurt her or killed her as you can hurt and kill anyone--with a {{penknife}} for example--and there were times when it seemed to him you could have destroyed the whole material universe and left her smiling still. But of this ambiguous element in the lady, more is to be told later. There are wider seas than ever keel sailed upon, and deeps that no lead of human casting will ever plumb. When it is all summed up, I have <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> <b>I</b> do not know, I cannot tell. I fall back upon Melville and my poor array of collected facts. At first there was amazingly little strangeness about her for any who had to deal with her. There she was, palpably solid and material, a lady out of the sea.|$|E
6000|$|... "As you will," [...] he answered. [...] "I {{have a great}} {{weakness}} which I {{am always}} ready <b>to</b> <b>admit.</b> <b>I</b> cannot bear the presence about me {{of people who have}} failed. You have become one of them, and I do not wish you to remain here. If," [...] he added, speaking more slowly, and looking meditatively into the decanter by his side, [...] "if you saw any chance by which, with the help of what you will find in that pocket-book, a little application, a little ingenuity, and a good deal of perseverance, you could undo some part of the mischief which your carelessness has caused, then, of course, I should lose that feeling concerning you, and your place here would be open for your return. It would probably, also, be to the advantage of your people if any such idea as this resulted in successful action on your part. There is enough in that pocket-book," [...] he added, [...] "to take you where you will, and to enable you to live as you will {{for the remainder of the}} year, and during that time your people also are provided for. I leave the matter in your hands." ...|$|E
60|$|CUSINS. It is {{historically}} true. <b>I</b> loathe having <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> it. <b>I</b> repudiate your sentiments. I abhor your nature. I defy you {{in every possible}} way. Still, it is true. But it {{ought not to be}} true.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not. But {{if he did}} come, {{how could}} I refuse to see him? I {{thought that he was}} here on Saturday, and <b>I</b> told Richard <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> him. <b>I</b> could not send him away from the door." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Assuredly! You will do me {{the justice}} <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that <b>I</b> have never pretended to like your country, have I? I hope {{to leave it}} for several years, if not for ever, within {{the course of a}} few weeks." ...|$|R
