5|$|As {{detailed}} in the Superman: The Movie DVD special effects documentary 'The Magic Behind The Cape', presented by optical effects supervisor Roy Field, in the end, three <b>techniques</b> <b>were</b> used {{to achieve the}} flying effects.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, new <b>techniques</b> <b>were</b> {{developed}} {{for the study of}} plants, including methods of optical microscopy and live cell imaging, electron microscopy, analysis of chromosome number, plant chemistry and the structure and function of enzymes and other proteins. In the last two decades of the 20th century, botanists exploited the techniques of molecular genetic analysis, including genomics and proteomics and DNA sequences to classify plants more accurately.|$|E
5|$|Leander {{has been}} {{described}} as having a strange playing style by Andre Agassi. He varies his play as the match goes on; {{he is one of the}} best volleyers and a talented dropshotter. His volleying <b>techniques</b> <b>were</b> learnt from former Indian player Akhtar Ali.|$|E

5|$|Rammed earth: The archaeological {{evidence}} {{of the use of}} rammed earth has been discovered in Neolithic archaeological sites of the Yangshao and Longshan cultures along the Yellow River in China, dating back to 5000 BC. By 2000 BC, rammed-earth architectural <b>techniques</b> <b>were</b> commonly used for walls and foundations in China.|$|E
5|$|Sophisticated <b>techniques</b> <b>were</b> used {{to delay}} the {{construction}} of the road. Sit-ins and site invasions were combined with sabotage to stop construction work temporarily. This led to large numbers of police and constant security patrols being employed to protect the construction sites, at great expense. By December 1994, the total cost of construction had been estimated at £6 million and rising by £500,000 every month.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic {{methods were}} {{predominantly}} used by physicists and astrophysicists. Spectroscopic <b>techniques</b> <b>were</b> rarely taught in chemistry classes and were unfamiliar to most practicing chemists. Beginning around 1904, Frank Twyman of the London instrument making firm Adam Hilger, Ltd. tried to develop spectroscopic instruments for chemists, but his customer base was consistently {{made up of}} physicists rather than chemists.|$|E
50|$|The Kochido in-training <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> {{applicable}} for street fights. There {{are generally}} no rules and all <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> allowed the opponent to check off. However, in the dojang (도장) {{for the purpose}} of safety, <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> not full-contact, they instead simulate an attack in a controlled manner.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{sequential}} optimization <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> {{presented in}} {{application to the}} dynamic weapon-target allocation problem. This problem is in general NP-Complete. The purpose of the optimization <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> to decompose the original search space into a sequence of smaller subspaces. Optimization over these subspaces (still NP-Complete) is of reduced dimensionality. The sequential decomposition <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> proven to preserve optimality. This sequential optimization <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> applied to an illustrative weapon-target allocation example relevant to naval warfare...|$|R
30|$|Possible feature {{reduction}} <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> <b>techniques</b> such as principle components, heuristic {{feature selection}} with wrapper method and feature selection with decision trees. Examples for case reduction <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> incremental samples, average samples, increasing the sampling period and strategic sampling of key events. For value reduction prominent <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> rounding, using k-means clustering and discretization using entropy minimization.|$|R
5|$|The Stargazer was to {{originally}} {{be represented}} by the movie-era Enterprise model, but producers were convinced to use a design which had appeared on a model in Picard's ready room in the series pilot. Several camera and compositing <b>techniques</b> <b>were</b> used by Bowman in filming the scenes aboard {{the bridge of the}} Stargazer, which was also a re-dressed movie-era Klingon Bird of Prey bridge set.|$|E
5|$|The composited camera {{negative}} of Citizen Kane {{was destroyed}} in a New Jersey film laboratory fire in the 1970s. Subsequent prints were derived from a master positive (a fine-grain preservation element) made in the 1940s and originally intended for use in overseas distribution. Modern <b>techniques</b> <b>were</b> used to produce a pristine print for a 50th Anniversary theatrical reissue in 1991 which Paramount released for then-owner Turner Broadcasting System, which earned $1.6 million in North America.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} {{attempted to}} limit the use of digital effects. However, {{because he wanted to}} evoke a Southern Gothic fantasy tone for Big Fish, color grading <b>techniques</b> <b>were</b> applied by Sony Pictures Imageworks. Stan Winston Studios, with whom Burton worked with on Edward Scissorhands (1990) and Batman Returns (1992), designed Helena Bonham Carter's prosthetic makeup and created the animatronics. Scenes with Karl the Giant were commissioned using forced perspective filmmaking.|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 15 - 17, 1969 / Sheraton Park Hotel, Washington, D. C. Various digital coding <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> {{discussed}} from an engineer's and user's {{point of}} view. Each <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> {{displayed in a}} uniform way which measures performance against the best possible (Shannon) channel. Encoding-decoding complexity and other "system" merits and drawbacks of each <b>technique</b> <b>are</b> discussed. The reader is introduced to coding by drawing analogies with an everyday and familiar coded communication channel - spoken English. Bit, word and block error detection and correction <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> then presented. Lastly, a concatenated block code scheme which combines these <b>techniques</b> <b>is</b> developed...|$|R
40|$|Two {{computational}} <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> {{developed to}} calculate the compressible vortex-dominated flows. The first <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> a finite-volume Euler Solver which uses four-Stage Runge-Kutta time stepping with second- and fourth-order dissipation terms. The <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> applied to supersonic conical and three-dimensional flows about sharp- and round-edged delta wings. Attached and separated-flow solutions have been obtained depending on the values of damping coefficients. The second <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> an integral-equation solver of the full potential equation which uses a volume-integral term {{in addition to the}} classical surface-integral terms. The <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> applied to transonic three-dimensional flows about sharp-edged delta wings. A hybrid technique which combines the finite-volume and the integral-equation solvers is also presented...|$|R
5|$|The mule, {{especially}} its fur, was intensely textured and detailed {{to make it}} look visually rough and bristly, and the mule itself weary and worn. The same <b>techniques</b> <b>were</b> applied to the red and yellow adornments draped and hung over the animal.|$|E
5|$|The {{report also}} {{considered}} using specialised Vietnamese language {{skills as a}} means of gathering intelligence and to control the minds of Vietnamese troops, but discarded it, citing that infiltration and clandestine anti-colonial <b>techniques</b> <b>were</b> rendering them irrelevant. The report thus concluded that deeper specialisation would not improve intelligence, and that a degree of expertise – to improve command skills – was all that one would need.|$|E
5|$|Buckets {{began to}} be {{replaced}} with plastic bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these <b>techniques</b> <b>were</b> not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate sap. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.|$|E

This therapeutic <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> the first in our country to offer for TTTs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{proposes a}} {{technique}} to detect defects as depicted in a thermal image. The <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> based on a local neighborhood pixel operation using kernel window 3 × 3. All pixels within this window will be mapped to only a single pixel value. Next, the thresholding <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> used. The main focus of the employed thresholding <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> the popular Otsu method and testing with other global thresholding <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> also given in the text. From the results obtained, it is shown that the proposed method is able to detect defects occur in a thermal image using any standard thresholding <b>technique</b> which <b>is</b> not designed for thermal images. The <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> easy to implement yet the result is promising...|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, the Disney short {{subjects}} were no longer being produced on a regular basis, with many of the shorts divisions' personnel either leaving the company or begin reassigned to work on Disney television programs such as The Mickey Mouse Club and Disneyland. While the Disney shorts had dominated the Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons) during the 1930s, its reign over the award had been ended by MGM's Tom and Jerry cartoons, Warner Bros' Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, and the works of United Productions of America (UPA), whose flat art style and stylized animation <b>techniques</b> <b>were</b> lauded as more modern alternatives to the older Disney style. During the 1950s, only one Disney short, the stylized Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom, won the Best Short Subject (Cartoons) Oscar.|$|E
5|$|During 1890 {{work began}} on an eighth fort, known as Linkuva; new {{construction}} <b>techniques</b> <b>were</b> introduced, particularly reinforced concrete. The Linkuva fort {{became the most}} modern entrenchment, equipped with electricity, sewerage, and casemates for a garrison of 1,000 personnel. At the same time, massive groundworks were laid along with additional defensive structures, effecting the complete enclosure of the city center between the Rivers Nemunas and Neris. By 1890, seven forts had been completed, supporting roads had been constructed, and a railroad bridge over the Nemunas had been adapted for military transport. By now, expenditures on the fortress had amounted to over nine million rubles. The first bricks for a church that would serve the garrison were laid in 1891; it was completed in 1893. The following year construction began on a dedicated narrow gauge railway.|$|E
5|$|East coast trade hummed, with goods {{arriving}} from Golkonda where rice, millet, pulses and tobacco were grown {{on a large}} scale. Dye crops of indigo and chay root were produced for the weaving industry. A mineral rich region, Machilipatnam was the gateway for high quality iron and steel exports. Diamond mining {{was active in the}} Kollur region. The cotton weaving industry produced two types of cottons, plain calico and muslin (brown, bleached or dyed). Cloth printed with coloured patterns crafted by native <b>techniques</b> <b>were</b> exported to Java and the Far East. Golkonda specialised in plain cotton and Pulicat in printed. The main imports on the east coast were non-ferrous metals, camphor, porcelain, silk and luxury goods.|$|E

40|$|Several <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> {{presented}} to perform static and dynamic load balancing schemes for integrated vision systems. These <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> novel {{in the sense}} that they capture the computational requirements of a task by examining the data when they are produced. Furthermore, they can be applied to many integrated vision systems because many algorithms in different systems are either the same or have similar computational characteristics. These <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> evaluated by applying them to the algorithms in a motion estimation system. It is shown that the performance gains when these <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> used are significant and the overhead of using these <b>techniques</b> <b>is</b> minimal. The performance is evaluated by implementing the algorithms using the presented techniques on a hypercube multiprocessor system...|$|R
40|$|The {{so-called}} table look-up {{classification procedure}} and {{a modification of}} it are discussed. These and several other classification <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> evaluated and simulation results comparing some of the <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> displayed.

5|$|Guilty Gear X {{continues}} its predecessor's timeline with new characters and gameplay features. Still a four-button game, its instant-kill <b>techniques</b> <b>were</b> weakened and a survival mode {{was added to}} the previous game's three modes. The Dreamcast and PS2 versions have sold over 100,000 copies in Japan; they have been praised for their graphics, controls and characters but criticized for their lack of replay value. The GBA version was the poorest-received, with the main complaints concerning ease and graphics.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, when a {{large chunk}} of stone fell from a statue near the main door, it became {{apparent}} that there was an urgent need for restoration of the west front. Detailed studies of the stonework and of conservation practices were undertaken under the cathedral architect, Alban D. R. Caroe and a restoration committee formed. The methods that were selected for conservation were those devised by Eve and Robert Baker. W. A. (Bert) Wheeler, clerk of works to the cathedral 1935–1978, had previously experimented with washing and surface-treatment of architectural carvings on the building and his <b>techniques</b> <b>were</b> among those tried on the statues.|$|E
5|$|In Five Songs (1956–57) and Musique funèbre (1958) Lutosławski {{introduced}} his {{own brand of}} twelve-tone music, marking his departure from the explicit use of folk music. His twelve-tone technique allowed him to build harmony and melody from specific intervals (in Musique funèbre, augmented fourths and semitones). This system also gave him the means to write dense chords without resorting to tone clusters, and enabled him to build towards these dense chords (which often include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale) at climactic moments. Lutosławski's twelve-note <b>techniques</b> <b>were</b> thus completely different in conception from Arnold Schoenberg's tone-row system, although Musique funèbre does happen {{to be based on}} a tone row. This twelve-note intervallic technique had its genesis in earlier works such as Symphony No. 1, and Paganini Variations.|$|E
40|$|A multidimensional {{dissipation}} <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> implemented on the Roe's flux difference splitting {{scheme to}} avoid the numerical shock instability that may occur in compressible flow solutions. The damping characteristic of the proposed <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> presented through a linear perturbation analysis {{on the problem of}} a moving shock along an odd-even grid perturbation. The performance of the proposed <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> studied using well-known problems that exhibit the numerical shock instability. The <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> further extended to achieve higher-order solution accuracy and evaluated by several benchmark test cases...|$|R
40|$|With {{everyday}} passing, {{power generation}} from photovoltaic (PV) systems are getting increased around the globe. One of the drawbacks of PV systems {{is that they}} exhibit non-linear I-V curves with respect to atmospheric conditions. Therefore, maximum power point tracker (MPPT) <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> installed in every PV system. One {{of the most popular}} <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> perturb & observe (P&O) but this technique has some shortcomings. In this paper, MPPT <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> proposed which will optimize the P&O with respect to distributed PV (DPV) plant. Such that the deficiencies of P&O are removed. The proposed <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> designed for DPV and is working in two modes. In mode- 1, decision making of the proposed technique revolves around the mutual co-ordination between two modules/arrays. During this mode, one array will behave as leader (L) while other array as follower (F). In mode- 2, proposed technique utilizes the individual P&O for both arrays. Model is the superior performance mode in which efficiency of the proposed <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> better than P&O. While, in mode- 2 both techniques have same efficiency. Finally, the proposed <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> modeled in Matlab/Simulink. The proposed <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> tested under various weather conditions and superior performance of the proposed <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> proved through simulation result...|$|R
