40|$|Engineers in the Integrated Design and Analysis Division (EV 30) use {{a variety}} of {{different}} tools to aid in the design and analysis of the Ares I vehicle. One primary tool in use is Pro-Engineer. Pro-Engineer is a computer-aided design (CAD) software that allows designers to create computer generated structural models of vehicle structures. For the Upper State <b>thrust</b> <b>cone,</b> Pro-Engineer was used to assist in the design of a layout for two camera housings. These cameras observe the separation {{between the first and second}} stage of the Ares I vehicle. For the Ares I-X, one standard speed camera was used. The Ares I design calls for two separate housings, three cameras, and a lighting system. With previous design concepts and verification strategies in mind, a new layout for the two camera design concept was developed with members of the EV 32 team. With the new design, Pro-Engineer was used to draw the layout to observe how the two camera housings fit with the <b>thrust</b> <b>cone</b> assembly. Future analysis of the camera housing design will verify the stability and clearance of the camera with other hardware present on the <b>thrust</b> <b>cone...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a program initiated to identify the cause and the mechanism of 4 -kHz vibrations of the Space Shuttle main engine's (SSME's) LOX inlet tee, which were revealed in 17 percent of the SSMEs during ground tests. The results of the engines' inspection, structural analyses, computational fluid dynamics studies, literature reviews, expert consultations, and laboratory testings identified the probable cause of the 4 -kHz vibrations being related {{to the fact that the}} walls of some tees were thinner than in the mojority of tees, resulting in less stiff structures. The mechanism of the vibrations was identified as vortex shedding in combination with a structural coupling with the <b>thrust</b> <b>cone,</b> which increased the vane mobility, which, in turn, aggravated the fluid coupling with the <b>thrust</b> <b>cone.</b> As a result, the vane mobility was increased, aggravating the fluid coupling with the vanes. An internal modification was developed and was successfully demonstrated on an engine that had previously exhibited a 4 -kHz problem...|$|E
40|$|A performance-analysis {{computer}} program, {{that was}} developed explicitly to generate optimum electric propulsion trajectory data for missions {{of interest in the}} exploration of the solar system is presented. The program was primarily designed to evaluate the performance capabilities of electric propulsion systems, and in the simulation {{of a wide variety of}} interplanetary missions. A numerical integration of the two-body, three-dimensional equations of motion and the Euler-Lagrange equations was used in the program. Transversality conditions which permit the rapid generation of converged maximum-payload trajectory data, and the optimization of numerous other performance indices for which no transversality conditions exist are included. The ability to simulate constrained optimum solutions, including trajectories having specified propulsion time and constant <b>thrust</b> <b>cone</b> angle, is also in the program. The program was designed to handle multiple-target missions with various types of encounters, such as rendezvous, stopover, orbital capture, and flyby. Performance requirements for a variety of launch vehicles can be determined...|$|E

It is a volcano <b>cone</b> <b>thrust</b> {{up out of}} deep sea, with a segment of the crater wall broken out. This gives sea {{entrance}} to the crater itself, and makes a fine sheltered harbour. And that's all. Nothing lives there. The outside and the inside of the crater are too steep. At one place, inside, is a patch of about a thousand coconut palms. And that's all, as I said, saving a few insects. No four-legged thing, even a rat, inhabits the place. And it's funny, most awful funny, with all those coconuts, not even a coconut crab. The only meat-food living was schools of mullet in the harbour--fattest, finest, biggest mullet I ever laid eyes on.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{have used}} {{analogue}} experiments {{to investigate the}} effects of surface topography on the curvature of fold-and-thrust belts, under conditions of (1) initial relief, but no erosion, and (2) no initial relief, but differential erosion, sedimentation and transport. In experiments where a 2 -layer model lithosphere shortened and thickened {{in front of an}} advancing straight piston, the geometry of the developing thrust wedge was very sensitive to variations in surface topography. In models with an initially flat, horizontal surface, {{and in the absence of}} erosion and sedimentation, thrusts were straight, propagated forwards, and nucleated at buckle folds far in front of an advancing piston. Around an initial topographic high (plateau or <b>cone),</b> <b>thrusts</b> tended to be arcuate, forming salients towards the foreland. Initial plateaux and cones tended to behave rigidly, while arcuate thrust slices formed around them. To accommodate differential slip, transfer zones developed on both sides of initial highs. Fault blocks rotated about vertical axes and thrusts moved in oblique slip within transfer zones. In models with initially horizontal surfaces, which were subject to differential erosion, sedimentation and transport, thrusts initially were straight, but then progressively rotated around non-eroded, thickened and stronger areas. These worked as indenters, in front of which new thrusts nucleated at curved buckle folds. These thrusts were also curved, their apices being in front of the thickened, non-eroded areas. In nature, arcuate structural patterns are to be found around the Altiplano of the Central Andes and around the Tromen volcanic ridge in the Neuquén Basin of northern Patagonia. We infer that these areas behaved in quasi-rigid fashion, protected as they were by their high elevations, and that differential erosion at the scale of the entire Andes may have contributed to oroclinal bending...|$|R

40|$|In this work, we {{complete}} {{the calculation of}} the soft part of the two-loop integrated jet thrust distribution in e + e − annihilation. This jet mass observable {{is based on the}} <b>thrust</b> <b>cone</b> jet algorithm, which involves a veto scale for out-of-jet radiation. The previously uncomputed part of our result depends in a complicated way on the jet cone size, r, and at intermediate stages of the calculation we actually encounter a new class of multiple polylogarithms. We employ an extension of the coproduct calculus to systematically exploit functional relations and represent our results concisely. In contrast to the individual contributions, the sum of all global terms can be expressed in terms of classical polylogarithms. Our explicit two-loop calculation enables us to clarify the small r picture discussed in earlier work. In particular, we show that the resummation of the logarithms of r that appear in the previously uncomputed part of the two-loop integrated jet thrust distribution is inextricably linked to the resummation of the non-global logarithms. Furthermore, we find that the logarithms of r which cannot be absorbed into the non-global logarithms in the way advocated in earlier work have coefficients fixed by the two-loop cusp anomalous dimension. We also show that in many cases one can straightforwardly predict potentially large logarithmic contributions to the integrated jet thrust distribution at L loops by making use of analogous contributions to the simpler integrated hemisphere soft function...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose the}} {{addition}} of a new "soft-collinear" mode to soft collinear effective theory (SCET) below the usual soft scale to factorize and resum logarithms of jet radii R in jet cross sections. We consider exclusive 2 -jet cross sections in e^+e^- collisions with an energy veto Λ on additional jets. The key observation is that there are actually two pairs of energy scales whose ratio is R: the transverse momentum QR of the energetic particles inside jets and their total energy Q, and the transverse momentum Λ R of soft particles that are cut out of the jet cones and their energy Λ. The soft-collinear mode is necessary to factorize and resum logarithms of the latter hierarchy. We show how this factorization occurs in the jet thrust cross section for cone and k_T-type algorithms at O(α_s) and using the <b>thrust</b> <b>cone</b> algorithm at O(α_s^ 2). We identify the presence of hard-collinear, in-jet soft, global (veto) soft, and soft-collinear modes in the jet thrust cross section. We also observe here that the in-jet soft modes measured with thrust are actually the "csoft" modes of the theory SCET_+. We dub the new theory with both csoft and soft-collinear modes SCET_++. We go on to explain the relation between the "unmeasured" jet function appearing in total exclusive jet cross sections and the hard-collinear and csoft functions in measured jet thrust cross sections. We do not resum logs that are non-global in origin, arising from the ratio of the scales of soft radiation whose thrust is measured at Qτ/R and of the soft-collinear radiation at 2 Λ R. Their resummation would require the introduction of additional operators beyond those we consider here. The steps we outline here are a necessary part of summing logs of R that are global in nature and have not been factorized and resummed beyond leading-log level previously.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of the work {{presented}} within this thesis was the testing and development of condition monitoring procedures for detection and diagnosis of HATT rotor imbalance faults. The condition monitoring processes were developed via Matlab {{with the goal of}} exploiting generator measurements for rotor fault monitoring. Suitable methods of turbine simulation and testing were developed in order to test the proposed CM processes. The algorithms were applied to both simulation based and experimental data sets which related to both steady-state and non-steady-state turbine operation. The work showed that development of condition monitoring practices based on analysis of data sets generated via CFD modelling was feasible. This could serve as a useful process for turbine developers. The work specifically showed that consideration of the torsional spectra observed in CFD datasets was useful in developing a, ‘rotor imbalance criteria’ which was sensitive to rotor imbalance conditions. Furthermore, based on the CFD datasets acquired it was possible to develop a parametric rotor model which was used to develop rotor torque time series under more general flow conditions. To further test condition monitoring processes and to develop the parametric rotor model developed based on CFD data a scale model turbine was developed. All aspects of data capture and test rig control was developed by the researcher. The test rig utilised data capture within the turbine nose cone which was synchronised with the global data capture clock source. Within the nose <b>cone</b> <b>thrust</b> and moment about one of the turbine blades was measured as well as acceleration at the turbine nose cone. The results of the flume testing showed that rotor imbalance criteria was suitable for rotor imbalance faults as applied to 4 generator quadrature axis current measurements as an analogue for drive train torque measurements. It was further found that feature fusion of the rotor imbalance criterion calculated with power coefficient monitoring was successful for imbalance fault diagnosis. The final part of the work presented was to develop drive train simulation processes which could be calculated in real-time and could be utilised to generate representative datasets under non-steady-state conditions. The parametric rotor model was developed, based on the data captured during flume testing, to allow for non-steady state operation. A number of simulations were then undertaken with various rotor faults simulated. The condition monitoring processes were then applied to the data sets generated. Condition monitoring based on operational surfaces was successful and normalised calculation of the surfaces was outlined. The rotor imbalance criterion was found to be less sensitive to the fault cases under non-steady state condition but could well be suitable for imbalance fault detection rather than diagnosis...|$|R
