50|$|Nonetheless, {{some have}} criticized the entire {{business}} model. In her book Confidence Game, Christine S. Richard examines the basic assumptions upon which the industry was based. She argues that a monoline's business can be seen as, basically, selling a <b>triple-A</b> <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> to a municipal bond issuer. However, the credit rating agencies had a separate “rating scale” applied to obligations of municipal issuers, as opposed to non-municipal issuers (e.g., corporations). Some argued that if the rating agencies had rated municipalities on the same scale they rated corporations, then the municipalities would have been rated much higher to begin with, and thus {{there was no real}} need for bond insurance. The question was debated before Congress in 2008, at the House Committee on Financial Services under Barney Frank. Richard Blumenthal, then-attorney general of Connecticut, Ajit Jain of Berkshire Hathaway, then-Superintendent Eric Dinallo of the New York State Insurance Department, and a Moody's representative were also in attendance.|$|E

40|$|Executive summary: While Commonwealth {{government}} debt {{has been the}} focus of attention recently, this report takes a broader view by bringing state debt into the picture. Much has been made of the fact that Commonwealth {{government debt}} is projected (under current expenditure and tax policies) to grow from $ 300 billion at June 2013 to more than $ 400 billion in 2016 – 17 — and keep growing. Over the same four years, net debt (after deducting certain financial assets) is expected to grow from $ 153 billion to $ 280 billion and then to $ 325 billion in 2018 – 19, at which point it will peak as a percentage of GDP. State debt has also risen dramatically since 2007, when net debt was negative. In the six years to 2013, states added $ 70 billion to their general government net debt to reach a positive level of $ 43 billion. Aggregate state debt is manageable at that level, but the upward trend is of concern—and more so in some states than others. By 2016 – 17, combined Commonwealth and state general government (GG) net debt will exceed $ 350 billion—almost 20 % of GDP, or more meaningfully, more than 50 % of general government revenue. The general government debt figures do not tell the full story. For the broader non-financial public sector (which includes non-financial public corporations), state net debt was much higher at $ 127 billion in 2013. Combined with the Commonwealth, total non-financial public sector net debt was $ 283 billion, already 50 % of the sector’s revenue. Public corporations’ debt is guaranteed by their government owners, but these corporations are better able to carry debt as their investments are supposed to be commercially viable. The above figures exclude non-debt financial liabilities such as unfunded superannuation and long-service leave liabilities. These loom large in state finances. When added to net debt, non-debt financial liabilities bring the 2013 total of net financial liabilities to $ 190 billion for state general government and $ 319 billion for the state non-financial public sector. In most states, general government net financial liabilities in 2013 exceeded 100 % of revenue, having increased steeply since 2007. The states’ financial position has deteriorated because their net operating surpluses have shrunk while capital (‘infrastructure’) spending soared, resulting in large cash deficits. All states have experienced this deterioration: Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania have lost the coveted <b>triple-A</b> <b>credit</b> <b>rating,</b> and NSW and Victoria are at risk of being downgraded should current trends continue. All states have curbed the growth of operating expenditure, but they will need to persevere in the face of sluggish revenue if they are to rebuild operating surpluses and avoid sharp cuts in capital expenditure...|$|E

40|$|Background: No <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> {{methodology}} currently {{exists for}} any of South Africa’s sub nationals. Aim: To develop a generic, quantitative <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodology for the Department of Health and the Department of Education combined, as well as specific quantitative <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodologies, for each department, individually. Setting: A comparison between generic and specific subnational <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodologies to assess which fits the South African subnational environment best. Studies and results obtained from other nations were used to construct the approach. Methods: In a typical <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodology, both quantitative and qualitative information is considered. In South Africa (as a developing economy), the quantitative information equates to a smaller portion of the final <b>credit</b> <b>rating.</b> A generic quantitative <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodology, as well as specific <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodologies, was developed. The appropriateness of these generic and specific models was tested with regards to prediction accuracies using Red, Amber or Green (RAG) statuses on a traffic light series. An illustration of the predicted versus actual ranks is provided, {{as well as an}} example to illustrate how model-predicted RAG statuses, based on quantitative information, may be overlaid with more recent qualitative information to derive a final ranking. Results: A generic, quantitative <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodology for the Departments of Health and the Department of Education combined was developed, as well as specific <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodologies for each department separately. The specific subnational <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodology outperformed the generic methodology considerably; more precisely, the generic models predicted a maximum of 50 % of the new cases correctly as opposed to the specific Health and Education models’ 78 %. Conclusion: The primary contribution {{of this study was to}} develop and compare generic and specific subnational <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodologies.
