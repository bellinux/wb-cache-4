50|$|Polymers exhibiting a shape-memory effect {{have both}} a visible, current (temporary) form and a stored (permanent) form. Once {{the latter has}} been {{manufactured}} by conventional methods, the material is changed into another, temporary form by processing through heating, deformation, and finally, cooling. The polymer maintains this temporary shape until the shape change into the permanent form is activated by a predetermined external stimulus. The secret behind these materials lies in their molecular network structure, which contains at least two separate phases. The phase showing the highest <b>thermal</b> <b>transition,</b> Tperm, is the temperature that must be exceeded to establish the physical crosslinks responsible for the permanent shape. The switching segments, on the other hand, are the segments {{with the ability to}} soften past a certain transition temperature (Ttrans) and are responsible for the temporary shape. In some cases this is the glass transition temperature (Tg) and others the melting temperature (Tm). Exceeding Ttrans (while remaining below Tperm) activates the switching by softening these switching segments and thereby allowing the material to resume its original (permanent) form. Below Ttrans, flexibility of the segments is at least partly limited. If Tm is chosen for programming the SMP, strain-induced crystallization of the switching segment can be initiated when it is stretched above Tm and subsequently cooled below Tm. These crystallites form covalent netpoints which prevent the polymer from reforming its usual coiled structure. The hard to soft segment ratio is often between 5/95 and 95/5, but ideally this ratio is between 20/80 and 80/20. The shape-memory polymers are effectively viscoelastic and many models and analysis methods exist.|$|E

40|$|Here, {{we present}} the thermal {{behavior}} of polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) containing weak polyelectrolytes poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) as influenced by water content and complexation pH. Modulated {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (MDSC) reveals a glass-transition-like <b>thermal</b> <b>transition</b> (Ttr) that decreases in value with increasing hydration and with decreasing complexation pH. We show the collapse of all Ttr values into a single master curve when plotted against the ratio of water molecules per intrinsic (PAH+-PAA-) ion pair for all pH values explored.

While soluble as unimers below 15 °C, all copolymers exhibited thermally induced two-step self-assembly in water, due to distinct lower critical solution temperature (LCST) phase transitions of PNPAM (around 20 °C) and PNEAM (around 70 °C). Their temperature-dependent self-organisation in dilute aqueous solution was studied by turbidimetry, dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and 1 H NMR spectroscopy. The copolymers show distinct, two-step self-organisation behaviour with respect to transition temperatures, aggregate type and size, which can be correlated to the relative lengths of the low and high LCST blocks. For polymers having short blocks with low LCST, the first <b>thermal</b> <b>transition</b> induces the formation of individual micelles.
