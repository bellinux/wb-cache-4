40|$|Because the {{feedback}} {{children and adolescents}} <b>receive</b> is important <b>to</b> their development, 2 experimental studies were designed to examine children 2 ̆ 7 s (M = 12 years) and adolescents 2 ̆ 7 (M = 17 years) active selection {{of the quality of}} feedback they wish <b>to</b> <b>receive.</b> <b>In</b> both studies <b>evidence</b> emerged that participants 2 ̆ 7 self-perceptions influence their feedback seeking. Participants with positive self-perceptions sought more positive feedback than participants with negative self-perceptions and sought more positive feedback than expected by chance. Participants with negative self-perceptions lacked this tendency to seek positive feedback and sometimes sought less positive feedback than expected by chance. As expected, depression and attachment-related measures were also associated with participants 2 ̆ 7 feedback seeking. Contributions of feedback-seeking patterns to stability and change in children 2 ̆ 7 s and adolescents 2 ̆ 7 development are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the use of audio-visual communications technology (specifically, video link) to enable courts <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> forensic <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> criminal cases. It outlines the legislative powers to take evidence via video link in Australia, identifying their broad discretionary nature, and analysing relevant case law on their interpretation. The article then discusses empirical findings from an Australian case study in a jurisdiction where a police forensic service has a policy to promote {{the use of this}} technology to take evidence from its staff. The findings suggest that, although the policy has had some success in influencing the approach of courts to the exercise of their powers to take evidence this way, video links are not being used as widely as originally envisaged. The reasons for this have to do both with the availability of the technology itself, and perceptions about its adequacy to deliver the evidence, particularly evidence that is complex, or requires the use of supporting visual aids...|$|R

Your Lordships have heard the Nabob speak of his misery, distress, and oppression; but here he makes a complete defeasance, as it were, of the whole charge, a direct disavowal of {{every one of the}} complaints, and particularly that of having never <b>received</b> an answer <b>to</b> these complaints. Oh, think, I say, my Lords, of the degraded, miserable, and unhappy state to which human nature may be reduced, when you hear this unhappy man declare that all the charges which we have made upon this subject relative to him, and which are all either admitted by him or taken from his own representation, are now stated by him in a paper before you to be all false, and {{that there is not a}} word of the representation which he had made of Mr. Hastings that has the least truth in it! Your Lordships will find this in that collection of various papers which ought to be preserved and put into every museum in Europe, as one of the most extraordinary productions that was ever exhibited to the world.|$|R
40|$|This project {{examined}} {{the variables that}} mediate {{the relationship between the}} exogenous variables numerical presentation and numeracy and the endogenous variables risk perception and risk related decisions. Previous research suggested that numerical format and numeracy influence outcomes. The question that remained unanswered was why? The goal of this project was to peer into the proverbial black box to critically examine information processing at work. To examine possible mediating variables, two theoretical models that have emerged in the risk perception literature were tested. The first is an evolutionary theory proposing that over time, individuals have developed an augmented ability to process frequency information. Thus, frequency information should be clearer and people should be faster at forming risk perceptions with information in this format. According to this model, processing speed and evidence clarity mediate the relationship between evidence format and risk perception. A second framework, the affective processing theory, argues that frequency information is more vivid and people derive more affect from information in this format. Therefore, according to this model, affect and vividness mediate the relationship between presentation format and risk perception. In addition to these two perspectives, a third theory was proposed and tested. The integrated theory of risk information processing predicted that reaction time, clarity, affect, and vividness would all influence risk perception. Two experiments were conducted to test the predictions of these three theories. Overall, some support for an integrated model was found. Results indicated that the mediating variables reaction time, clarity, affect, and vividness had direct effects on risk perception. In addition, risk perception had a strong influence on risk related decisions. In Study 2, objective numeracy had a direct effect on reaction time, such that people with high numeracy spent more time forming risk evaluations. Furthermore, people with a preference for numerical information evaluated numerical evidence as clearer and more vivid than people who preferred <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> nonnumerical formats. Both theoretical and applied implications of these results are discussed and recommendations for future research are provided...|$|R
