In {{order to}} improve the {{development}} quality of car <b>towing</b> <b>hook,</b> through a car front <b>towing</b> <b>hook</b> design and development, we analyze the strength of <b>towing</b> <b>hook</b> and local parts using CAE.

50|$|The Überlandwagen {{shared a}} common chassis with the A7V tank, with {{suspension}} derived from the American Holt tractor and twin 100 hp Daimler engines centrally mounted. A driving position was sited above the engines on a platform, with dual sets of controls for driving in either direction to avoid the need to turn the vehicle. A canopy was fitted over the driving position, and wooden dropsides and ends were fitted at {{the front and rear}} of the vehicle. Some examples had rails added to support a tarpaulin over the load spaces. <b>Towing</b> <b>hooks</b> were fitted {{at both ends of the}} chassis.|$|E
50|$|The later {{model used}} a Cletrac-type final drive (instead of the automotive-type {{differential}} unit used previously) {{along with many}} other improvements. The engine was mounted {{on the floor of the}} driving cab with the drive taken through a single plate clutch to the transmission. The transmission had four forward gears and one reverse. The suspension consisted of four large pressed-steel disk wheels on each side, mounted in pairs with elliptic springs. Steering involved upright steering levers to four hydraulic brakes on the sprockets and idlers. A spring-loaded pintle was fitted at the rear, and <b>towing</b> <b>hooks</b> were fitted in the front. It had a speed of about 30 km/h.|$|E

40|$|Bracket <b>towing</b> <b>hook</b> {{construction}} planning {{is to make}} a construction that has the stress level of the allowable limit and can be accepted by the construction. Requirements for <b>towing</b> <b>hook</b> are structural strength if the stress levels that occur below the elastic region. By calculating the value of the maximum load, maximum stress, von mises stress and deflection (displasment) that occur in the construction of bracket <b>towing</b> <b>hook,</b> so that known security level of construction that has been designed. Research on construction of the strength bracket <b>towing</b> <b>hook</b> need to be considered and carried out, where the stress caused by load about them should not exceed the maximum limit σ yield materials and σ allow based on the rules from the class. The reference to rules used in this research is based on the rules of Bureau Classification Indonesia. Analysis of the strength bracket <b>towing</b> <b>hook</b> construction is done by using finite element methode. The analysis used is a static load analysis to determine the characteristics and location of greatest stress on the construction bracket <b>towing</b> <b>hook</b> based on three variations of loading. Analysis results obtained using finite element methode based program of greatest stress maximum occurs in the condition of the bracket <b>towing</b> <b>hook</b>  with maximum horse power load that is equal to 44, 2 N/mm 2 where the most critical area occurs at node 457 which is located at frame number 23 lengthwise section and stiffener number 7 cross section. This stress is still in a safe condition because after compared with material σ yield of 400 N/mm 2 and σ allow based BKI rules of 178, 12 N/mm 2 produce safety factor value of 9, 05 and 4, 03 </p...|$|R

50|$|In October 1931 the Conseil Consultatif de l'Armement, under strong {{pressure}} by the Infantry {{to reach a}} quick decision, chose the Renault vehicle for production, even though the trial process hadn't been completed. On 9 December an order of fifty was made for the Chenillette de ravitaillement d'Infanterie Modèle 1931 R. On 26 March 1932 a preseries of fifty tractor-carrying trailers was ordered, the first was delivered in June. Further orders followed, mass-production commencing {{in the second half}} of 1934. The series vehicles differed from the first in having a towing sign plate fitted on the top, new <b>towing</b> <b>hooks</b> and an elongated stowage box on the left side. Orders reached a total of 793 on 1 January 1936 and of about 1,200 by June 1936 — 700 of which had been delivered by June 1936, 920 by October 1936, 976 on 1 January 1937. In December 1936 the military branch of Renault was nationalised as the AMX company which continued production to a total of about 2,200, later joined by Berliet which would build another 100 and Fouga which would produce 300 for a grand total for the Modèle 31 of about 2600.|$|E
40|$|<b>Towing</b> <b>hooks</b> {{generally}} are assembled to vehicles as accessory. They {{are used to}} tow caravans and trailers having no engine, which provide accommodation and haulage of loads, respectively. So, the transport capacity of cars is increased safely. <b>Towing</b> <b>hooks</b> require different constructive structures due to different chassis or monocoque body of each car type; hence {{they are to be}} manufactured and assembled in small- or middle-size factories as per order. In this study, three different constructions of towing hook are modelled and structurally analysed. The results obtained are compared with each other to improve the structural strength...|$|E

By introduction of the proposed manufacturing method of <b>towing</b> <b>hooks</b> depending on the size of the series 30000 hooks per year will be achieved annually savings of over 4. 000. 000 CZK.

40|$|Whiplash injury occurs {{mainly as}} a result of {{rear-end}} collisions. The assumption is that the less easily flexible rear-end a car has, the greater the chance of whiplash. A fitted towing hook increases the stiffness of the rear-end of cars. This report explores the relationship between <b>towing</b> <b>hooks</b> and whiplash in greater depth. The old design of the towing hook has a negative influence on the crushable zone at the rear end of cars. At this moment, however, it is not clear if there is a problem as far as the number of whiplash accidents is concerned. No data is known about the numbers installed of the old design <b>towing</b> <b>hooks.</b> It can be concluded, that in the short term, not much can be done to improve the modern towing hook to reduce the chance of whiplash. That is why owners of cars fitted with a towing hook need information about the correct use of a head restraint...|$|E
