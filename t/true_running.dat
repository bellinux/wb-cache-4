25|$|After {{a two-month}} break, Grey Momus {{returned}} {{to run at}} the autumn meetings at Newmarket. On {{the opening day of}} the First October meeting he contested the Grand Duke Michael Stakes over ten furlongs and won at odds of 1/4 from Dash, with the 1000 Guineas winner Barcarolle in third. On the following day, Grey Momus was opposed by only one horse, a colt named Quo Minus in the Newmarket St. Leger and won at odds of 1/15. On his final start of the year, Grey Momus ran a £500 match at Newmarket's Houghton meeting on 2 November, and was beaten over two miles by Caravan. This defeat confirmed the belief of some observers that the successes of Grey Momus in 1838 owed more to his connections clever selection of targets rather than any exceptional ability.

2500|$|On 28 May (Memorial Day), Carry Back contested the Metropolitan Mile {{for which}} the American Horse of the Year Kelso was made 3/5 {{favorite}} despite carrying 133 pounds. Ridden by Johnny Rotz (Ycaza had been suspended for his ride on Ridan in the Preakness), Carry Back took the lead well inside the final furlong and won by {{two and a half}} lengths from Merry Ruler with Kelso in sixth. The prize money of $72,735 enabled him to become the fourth millionaire thoroughbred in American racing history. Carry Back's winning time of 1:33.6 for the mile equaled the track record but Price admitted that Kelso, who was making his first appearance of the year, had not given his <b>true</b> <b>running</b> and was still the better horse. On July 4, Carry Back and Kelso met again in what was expected to be a virtual match race for the Suburban Handicap, but both were well beaten by the surprise winner Beau Purple. Ten days later, Carry Back, Kelso and Beau Purple all ran in the Monmouth Handicap. Carry Back showed his well-being as he [...] "kicked and squirmed" [...] in the paddock before the race and went on to produce his best performance of the year. Rotz produced Carry Back with a late challenge to take the lead halfway down the stretch and win by three lengths from Kelso in a track record time of 2:00.4 for the mile and a quarter. A week later, Carry Back started favorite for the Brooklyn Handicap but finished fourth to Beau Purple, to whom he was conceding ten pounds. With Rotz suspended, Carry Back was reunited with John Sellers in the Whitney Handicap at Saratoga in August. Carrying top weight of 130 pounds, Carry Back started odds-on favorite and won by two lengths from Crozier. By this time, Carry Back's winnings of $1,128,150 had taken him to third place in the all-time earners list, behind only Round Table and Nashua. On August 28 Carry Back easily defeated Beau Purple by eight lengths in the one mile Wilderness Handicap at Aqueduct, but ran a disappointing fourth to Crozier in the Aqueduct Stakes a week later.|$|E

40|$|The running {{ability of}} Tyrannosaurus rex has been intensively studied {{due to its}} {{relevance}} to interpretations of feeding behaviour and the biomechanics of scaling in giant predatory dinosaurs. Different studies using differing methodologies have produced a very wide range of top speed estimates and there is therefore a need to develop techniques that can improve these predictions. Here we present a new approach that combines two separate biomechanical techniques (multibody dynamic analysis and skeletal stress analysis) to demonstrate that <b>true</b> <b>running</b> gaits would probably lead to unacceptably high skeletal loads in T. rex. Combining these two approaches reduces the high-level of uncertainty in previous predictions associated with unknown soft tissue parameters in dinosaurs, and demonstrates that the relatively long limb segments of T. rex—long argued to indicate competent running ability—would actually have mechanically limited this species to walking gaits. Being limited to walking speeds contradicts arguments of high-speed pursuit predation for the largest bipedal dinosaurs like T. rex, and demonstrates the power of multiphysics approaches for locomotor reconstructions of extinct animals...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUsing {{conventional}} grinding wheels, wheel-sided chatter vibration {{is one of}} {{the limiting}} factors in terms of productivity and surface fin-ish. Initial vibration related to the dynamic behavior of the machine tool copy on the grinding wheel and its amplitude amplifies by abra-sion. To ensure high workpiece quality many expensive truing cycles are needed. In this context, we suggest a new set-up for the auto-matic chatter detection and elimination for external cylindrical grinding machines, reducing not only the high amount of <b>true</b> <b>running</b> cycles, but also improving the efficiency. In order to suppress the generation of the waviness on the grinding wheel the effect has to be identified during an early stage of its development. Therefore, a grinding machine is equipped with different types of sensors, i. e., eddy current, force, acoustic emission, acceleration sensors, and a tactile probe. Experimental results show, that exclusively measuring the displacement at the workpiece is sufficient for online computing wheel's waviness. Based on a model of the grinding process the other redundant sensors are used for validation. In addition, a robust online chatter detector based on the wavelet transformation is developed recognizing an instable grinding process. This model-based detection and estimation of waviness delivers solid results, it should be used for suppression of chatter in further work...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAlthough coordinated {{patterns}} of body movement {{can be used}} to communicate action intention, they {{can also be used to}} deceive. Often known as deceptive movements, these unpredictable {{patterns of}} body movement can give a competitive advantage to an attacker when trying to outwit a defender. In this particular study, we immersed novice and expert rugby players in an interactive virtual rugby environment to understand how the dynamics of deceptive body movement influence a defending player’s decisions about how and when to act. When asked to judge final running direction, expert players who were found to tune into prospective tau-based information specified in the dynamics of ‘honest’ movement signals (Centre of Mass), performed significantly better than novices who tuned into the dynamics of ‘deceptive’ movement signals (upper trunk yaw and out-foot placement) (p<. 001). These findings were further corroborated in a second experiment where players were able to move as if to intercept or ‘tackle’ the virtual attacker. An analysis of action responses showed that experts waited significantly longer before initiating movement (p<. 001). By waiting longer and picking up more information that would inform about future running direction these experts made significantly fewer errors (p<. 05). In this paper we not only present a mathematical model that describes how deception in body-based movement is detected, but we also show how perceptual expertise is manifested in action expertise. We conclude that being able to tune into the ‘honest’ information specifying <b>true</b> <b>running</b> action intention gives a strong competitive advantage...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{presented}} at the Fuel Cell Seminar, Los Angeles, November 11 - 16, 2015. This paper was accepted for publication in the journal ECS Transactions and the definitive published version is available at [URL] Energy Management Strategy (EMS) of any hybrid vehicle is responsible for determining the operating state of many components on board the vehicle and therefore has significant effect on the fuel economy, emissions, ageing of components and vehicle drive-ability. It is generally accepted that Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) can be used to produce a near-optimal control strategy provided that an accurate Markov model of the drive-cycle is available, and the cost function used for the optimisation is representative of the <b>true</b> <b>running</b> cost of the vehicle. The vast majority of research in this field focussing solely on the optimisation of the fuel economy, however for a fuel cell hybrid vehicle, the degradation of the fuel cell contributes significantly to the overall running cost of the vehicle, and should therefore be included in calculation of the running cost during the optimisation process. In this work, an optimised controller using SDP is developed for a campus passenger vehicle in order to minimise the lifetime cost of both fuel consumption and fuel cell degradation. The vehicle is then simulated over a number of typical journeys obtained from data logging during its use on the University of Birmingham's campus. It is shown that the expected lifetime cost due to fuel cell degradation massively outweighs the cost of the fuel consumed...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is to {{determine}} the true cost incurred by the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in order to meet their EU renewable electricity targets. The primary all-island of Ireland policy goal is that 40 % of electricity will come from renewable sources in 2020. From this it is expected that wind generation on the Irish electricity system will be in the region of 32 - 37 % of total generation. This leads to issues resulting from wind energy being a non-synchronous, unpredictable and variable source of energy use on a scale never seen before for a single synchronous system. If changes are not made to traditional operational practices, the efficient running of the electricity system will be directly affected by these issues in the coming years. Using models of the electricity system for the all-island grid of Ireland, the effects of high wind energy penetration expected to be present in 2020 are examined. These models were developed using a unit commitment, economic dispatch tool called PLEXOS which allows for a detailed representation of the electricity system to be achieved down to individual generator level. These models replicate the <b>true</b> <b>running</b> of the electricity system through use of day-ahead scheduling and semi-relaxed use of these schedules that reflects the Transmission System Operator's of real time decision making on dispatch. In addition, it carefully considers other non-wind priority dispatch generation technologies that {{have an effect on the}} overall system. In the models developed, three main issues associated with wind energy integration were selected to be examined in detail to determine the sensitivity of assumptions presented in other studies. These three issues include wind energy's non-synchronous nature, its variability and spatial correlation, and its unpredictability. This leads to an examination of the effects in three areas: the need for system operation constraints required for system security; different onshore to offshore ratios of installed wind energy; and the degrees of accuracy in wind energy forecasting. Each of these areas directly impact the way in which the electricity system is run as they address each of the three issues associated with wind energy stated above, respectively. It is shown that assumptions in these three areas have a large effect on the results in terms of total generation costs, wind curtailment and generator technology type dispatch. In particular accounting for these issues has resulted in wind curtailment being predicted in much larger quantities than had been previously reported. This would have a large effect on wind energy companies because it is already a very low profit margin industry. Results from this work have shown that the relaxation of system operation constraints is crucial to the economic running of the electricity system with large improvements shown in the reduction of wind curtailment and system generation costs. There are clear benefits in having a proportion of the wind installed offshore in Ireland which would help to reduce variability of wind energy generation on the system and therefore reduce wind curtailment. With envisaged future improvements in day-ahead wind forecasting from 8 % to 4 % mean absolute error, there are potential reductions in wind curtailment system costs and open cycle gas turbine usage. This work illustrates the consequences of assumptions in the areas of system operation constraints, onshore/offshore installed wind capacities and accuracy in wind forecasting to better inform the true costs associated with running Ireland's changing electricity system as it continues to decarbonise into the near future. This work also proposes to illustrate, through the use of Ireland as a case study, the effects that will become ever more prevalent in other synchronous systems as they pursue a path of increasing renewable energy generation...|$|E
