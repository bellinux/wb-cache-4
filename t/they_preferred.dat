5|$|In the 1860s and 1870s, German {{settlers}} {{from the}} Barossa Valley travelled upstream {{to settle in}} the eastern Riverina. Because of their religious distinctiveness as Lutherans, <b>they</b> <b>preferred</b> to form clustered German settlements. In 1867 and 1868 several land parcels were taken up in the Jindera area. 56 German farmers, in 1869, took six weeks to travel six hundred miles in covered wagons to establish the town of Walla Walla.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} of the strategy, {{contrasting}} Aberhart's proposals with Douglas's, failed largely because both men were too evasive in their statements to make any kind of direct comparison of their views. Lakeland College historian Franklin Foster offers an additional explanation: when Albertans were exposed to the charismatic evangelist Aberhart and the dry technocrat Douglas, <b>they</b> <b>preferred</b> the former, irrespective of credentials or economic expertise.|$|E
5|$|The show {{received}} a setback when the BBC rejected proposals {{for a series}} IX. Doug Naylor confirmed that the BBC decided not to renew the series as <b>they</b> <b>preferred</b> to work on other projects. A short animated Christmas special was, however, made available to mobile phone subscribers. Ultimately, however, fans had to wait a decade before the series returned to television.|$|E
5000|$|Scientific {{studies of}} animal welfare {{concerning}} captive golden hamsters have shown <b>they</b> <b>prefer</b> to use running wheels of large diameters (35 cm diameter was preferred over 23 cm, and 23 cm over 17.5 cm,), and that <b>they</b> <b>prefer</b> bedding material which {{allows them to}} build nests, if nesting material is not already available. [...] <b>They</b> <b>prefer</b> lived-in bedding (up to two weeks old [...] - [...] longer durations were not tested) over new bedding, suggesting <b>they</b> may <b>prefer</b> bedding changes at two-week intervals rather than weekly or daily. [...] <b>They</b> also <b>prefer</b> opaque tubes closed at one end, 15 cm in diameter, to use as shelter in which to nest and sleep.|$|R

25|$|Aside from {{religious}} reasons (discussed below), {{some people find}} <b>they</b> <b>prefer</b> cremation over traditional burial for personal reasons. The thought {{of a long and}} slow decomposition process is unappealing to some; many people find that <b>they</b> <b>prefer</b> cremation because it disposes of the body instantly.|$|R
5|$|Although about 300 French knights {{accompanied}} {{him to the}} Holy Land, no influential noblemen joined him; <b>they</b> <b>preferred</b> participating in the French Albigensian Crusade or did not see him as sufficiently eminent. John's cousin, Walter of Montbéliard, joined him only after he was expelled from Cyprus. Montbéliard led a naval expedition to Egypt to plunder the Nile Delta. After most of the French crusaders left the Holy Land, John forged a new truce with Al-Adil {{by the middle of}} 1211 and sent envoys to Pope Innocent urging him to preach a new crusade.|$|E
5|$|Although the duo {{felt that}} the presets and {{parameters}} of digital tools would inhibit creativity and innovation, they admitted that Random Access Memories {{could not have been}} made in the complete absence of computer technology. The sessions were recorded simultaneously onto Ampex reels and as Pro Tools tracks; Daft Punk and Guzauski would then listen to each recording in both analogue and digital iterations, deciding which of the two <b>they</b> <b>preferred.</b> Subsequently, the elements were edited by the duo with Pro Tools in a manner similar to how they would work with samples.|$|E
5|$|Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin {{had ordered}} all {{settlers}} to stay {{to the east}} of the Divide, as the state and federal governments had not made peace with the Utes. Nevertheless, some defied the order, drawn by the prospect of mining fortunes. Settlers sometimes used Hunter Pass to get to Ashcroft, an early camp on Castle Creek above the Roaring Fork. However, <b>they</b> <b>preferred</b> to take the southern route over the slightly higher Cottonwood Pass through Taylor Park and then back over Taylor Pass to get there, even though this made for a 100-mile (160km) journey, 40 miles (64km) more than the direct route offered by Hunter Pass.|$|E

5000|$|A local grocery store, [...] "Spar", has {{operated}} {{in the district}} since June 29, 2011. Additionally, a mobile grocery delivery service is also available for residents, if <b>they</b> <b>prefer</b> items that are only available from a bigger grocery chain, or if <b>they</b> <b>prefer</b> a usually cheaper price.|$|R
5000|$|Surveys have {{reported}} that 5-25 percent of Western women do not wear a bra. [...] A Harris Poll commissioned by Playtex asked more than 1,000 women what they like in a bra. Among the respondents, 67 percent said <b>they</b> <b>prefer</b> wearing a bra to going braless, while 85 percent wanted to wear a [...] "shape-enhancing bra that feels like nothing at all." [...] They were split as regards underwire bras: 49 percent said <b>they</b> <b>prefer</b> underwire bras, the same percentage as those who said <b>they</b> <b>prefer</b> wireless bras.|$|R
5|$|On 26 November, a week's filming with Firth, Rush, and Jacobi {{began at}} Ely Cathedral, the {{location}} used for Westminster Abbey. The production {{had asked for}} permission to film in the Abbey but were denied due {{to the demands of}} tourism. Though Lincoln Cathedral is architecturally a closer match to the Abbey, <b>they</b> <b>preferred</b> Ely, a favoured filming location. Its size allowed them to build sets showing not just the coronation, but the preparations before it.|$|E
5|$|Organ {{builders}} {{began to}} lean towards specifications with fewer mixtures and high-pitched stops. <b>They</b> <b>preferred</b> {{to use more}} 8 and 16 stops in their specifications and wider pipe scales. These practices created a warmer, richer sound than was common in the 18th century. Organs began {{to be built in}} concert halls (such as the organ at the Palais du Trocadéro in Paris), and composers such as Camille Saint-Saëns and Gustav Mahler used the organ in their orchestral works.|$|E
5|$|Thayer's {{original}} argument, restated by Cott, {{was that}} nature did {{the exact opposite}} with countershading that an artist did with paint when creating the illusion of solid three-dimensionality, namely counteracting the effect of shade to flatten out form. Shading is a powerful cue used by animals in different phyla to identify the shapes of objects. Research with chicks showed that <b>they</b> <b>preferred</b> to peck at grains with shadows falling below them (as if illuminated from above), so both humans and birds may make use of shading as a depth cue.|$|E
5000|$|Speckled darters are {{freshwater}} fish. <b>They</b> <b>prefer</b> clear {{pools of}} up to 1 m deep, with moderately swift streams. <b>They</b> typically <b>prefer</b> a bottom of sand or sand and gravel.|$|R

5|$|The {{brothers}} primarily {{developed for}} the ZX Spectrum, given Chris's expertise with its Z80 processor. Tim would later also develop the concepts behind new intellectual properties. The brothers each had a strong intuition for {{the elements of a}} successful game. Ultimate found success with games such as Jetpac (1983), Atic Atac (1983), Sabre Wulf (1984), and Knight Lore (1984), whose expansive experiences exceeded the scope of their contemporary arcade games. The brothers outsourced the programming of their games for other platforms to outside developers, for <b>they</b> <b>preferred</b> the work of making new games over re-programming old ones.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-three years later, in 1976, sexologist Shere Hite {{published}} {{a report on}} the sexual encounters of 3,019 women who had responded to questionnaires, under the title The Hite Report. Hite's questions differed from Kinsey's, focusing more on how women identified, or what <b>they</b> <b>preferred</b> rather than experience. Respondents to Hite's questions indicated that 8% preferred sex with women and 9% answered that they identified as bisexual or had sexual experiences with men and women, though they refused to indicate preference.|$|E
5|$|Bean {{was born}} in Handsworth, a suburb of Sheffield, which was then part of West Riding of Yorkshire (the County of South Yorkshire was created in 1974). He {{is the son of}} Rita (née Tuckwood) and Brian Bean. He has a younger sister named Lorraine. His father owned a {{fabrication}} shop that employed 50 people, including Bean's mother, who worked as a secretary. Despite becoming relatively wealthy, the family never moved away from the council estate as <b>they</b> <b>preferred</b> to remain close to friends and family. As a child, Bean smashed a glass door during an argument, which left a piece of glass embedded in his leg that briefly impeded his walking and left a large scar. This prevented him from pursuing his dream of playing football professionally.|$|E

50|$|A {{referendum}} {{regarding the}} political status of Puerto Rico was held. Puerto Rican voters were asked two questions: First, whether <b>they</b> <b>prefer</b> {{the status quo}} of remaining a U.S. unincorporated territory—a majority (54%), rejected the status quo. The second question asked whether <b>they</b> <b>prefer</b> statehood, independence or free association—a majority (61% of votes cast) supported statehood for Puerto Rico.|$|R
5|$|In Britain gay saunas were {{routinely}} raided by police {{up until the}} end of the 1980s (for example raids in May 1988 on Brownies in Streatham, the owner getting a six-month jail sentence and a £5,000 fine, and the Brooklyn House Hotel sauna in Manchester). By the 1990s, with increasing scrutiny of the costs of such operations (charges of gross indecency in a sauna normally needing the expense of undercover officers), a reduced likelihood of successful prosecution, concerns of being perceived as homophobic, and little public interest in victimless crime, gay saunas became free to operate without the risk of being raided by police. Also, police attitudes meant that they were more willing to turn a blind eye because <b>they</b> <b>preferred</b> such activity to take place in a contained environment rather than outdoors even though users were still committing the homosexual sexual offence of gross indecency, until gross indecency was wiped from the statute books following the Sexual Offences Act 2003.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} trial, 38 Dutch-speaking local {{elementary}} school girls circled the letters <b>they</b> <b>preferred</b> in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant {{preference for the}} letters of one's own name over {{those of the other}} person was found. The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: 1) either pairs or triads of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last. All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out. No significant difference was found using family name rather than first name or both names. While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent data analysis revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initial.|$|E
5|$|Most Hungarian lords and the prelates {{opposed the}} {{restoration}} of paganism. <b>They</b> <b>preferred</b> the devout Christian Andrew to his pagan brother Levente, even if, {{at least according to}} Kristó and Steinhübel, the latter was the eldest among Vazul's three sons. The Hungarian chronicles write that Levente, who died in short time, did not oppose his brother's ascension to the throne. The three bishops who had survived the pagan uprising crowned Andrew in Székesfehérvár {{in the last quarter of}} 1046 or in the spring of 1047. Historian Ferenc Makk writes that Andrew was crowned with a crown that the Byzantine Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos had sent to him. Nine enamelled plaques from this golden crown were unearthed in Nyitraivánka (Ivanka pri Nitre, Slovakia) in the 19th century. Andrew soon broke with his pagan supporters, restored Christianity and declared pagan rites illegal. According to Kosztolnyik, Andrew's epithets (the White or the Catholic) are connected to these events.|$|E

5|$|On 9 May 2009, {{weeks after}} the stadium opened, part of the ground's away section was {{earmarked}} for conversion into terracing. This was because of high demand from away supporters, who had previously {{had to pay for}} a seating ticket, even though <b>they</b> <b>preferred</b> to stand. Even before this remodelling was complete, Malmö FF lowered the away ticket prices to match the price of a home terracing ticket. This restructuring was completed before the 2010 season. The terracing for the home supporters was also modified to ease mobility, and combat safety issues in the stands. The old pitch was removed and a new one was installed in preparation for the 2015 Allsvenskan season. The new surface was produced from the same Dutch grass producer who will provide the pitch for the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final at Olympiastadion Berlin. UEFA had previously criticized the surface at the stadium following the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League group stage.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{established}} colonial settlements {{to extend}} their power over the surrounding territory, and to serve as administrative centres. <b>They</b> <b>preferred</b> to locate these towns in areas with dense native populations, or close to easily exploitable mineral wealth. Many Spanish towns were founded close to pre-Columbian centres of population. Trujillo was founded near the native settlement of Guaimura, and Comayagua was founded upon a pre-existing town of the same name. In {{the first half of}} the 16th century, towns were abandoned or moved for a variety of reasons, including native attacks, harsh conditions, and the spread of Old World diseases such as smallpox, measles, typhoid, yellow fever, and malaria. In many cases, towns were moved for purely political reasons owing to infighting between Spanish factions, with those currently in power seeking to undermine the work of those who had come before them. The frequent relocation of colonial towns and the reallocation of encomiendas served to prolong political instability, and delay the progress of the conquest.|$|E
5|$|From {{around this}} time onwards, while Etty still held to his belief {{that the purpose of}} art is to {{illustrate}} moral lessons, he began to abandon the literary, religious and mythological themes which had dominated his work. He began to paint still lifes, beginning with Pheasant and Peach (likely to be the painting now called Dead Pheasant and Fruit); in the 1840s he exhibited six in total, and painted many more. Etty was the first English painter to paint significant still lifes, which at the time were thought by the English a primarily Netherlandish form. Also for the first time, he began to paint a significant number of landscape paintings. Etty still continued to paint history paintings, but while he continued to produce highly acclaimed reworkings of his previous pictures, those works on fresh topics were generally poorly received. Etty's decline in quality can possibly be attributed in part to London art dealers; from 1835 dealer Richard Colls had become increasingly close to Etty, and by 1844 had a near-monopoly on his work. As the importance of the landed gentry to the art market declined, the new purchasers of art were industrialists; generally lacking in a classical education and with little interest in Old Masters, <b>they</b> <b>preferred</b> to buy works by then-contemporary artists such as Etty, and relied on dealers to advise them.|$|E
