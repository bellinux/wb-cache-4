The EFR 3 A gene has recently been discovered {{to be involved in}} the pathogenesis of <b>dying</b> <b>back.</b> The relationship of EFR 3 A and spiral ganglion degeneration, however, was rarely investigated. In this study, we destroyed the hair cells of the mouse cochlea by co-administration of kanamycin and furosemide and then investigated the EFR 3 A expression during the induced spiral ganglion cell degeneration. Our results revealed that co-administration of kanamycin and furosemide quickly induced hair cell loss in the C 57 BL/ 6 J mice and then resulted in progressive degeneration of the spiral ganglion beginning at day 5 following drug administration. The number of the spiral ganglion cells began to decrease at day 15. The expression of EFR 3 A increased remarkably in the spiral ganglion at day 5 and then decreased to near normal level within the next 10 days. Our study suggested that the change of EFR 3 A expression in the spiral ganglion was coincident with the time of the spiral ganglion degeneration, which implied that high expression of EFR 3 A may be important to prompt initiation of spiral ganglion degeneration following hair cell loss...|$|R

50|$|It {{was during}} the time the {{corduroy}} track was built that the local environment began to change. Previous paleo-environmental studies on the moor indicate peat growth began around 3000BC.

We describe the biphasic nature of axon degeneration after axotomy and our current understanding of how Wld(S) [...] an extraordinary protein formed by fusing a Ube 4 b sequence to Nmnat 1 [...] acts to protect severed axons. Interestingly, the neuroprotective effects of Wld(S) span all species tested, which suggests that there is an ancient, Wld(S) -sensitive axon destruction program.

50|$|As {{with all}} grafts, this plant will {{not occur in}} nature and cannot be grown from seed, because the {{two parts of the}} plant remain genetically separate, and only rely on each other for {{nourishment}} and growth. Like most standard types of plant grafting, a small incision is made in the stem of both plants and they are strapped together. Once the cuts have healed and the plants are joined, the leafy top of the potato plant can be cut away and the roots of the tomato can be removed, leaving the leaves of the tomato plant to nourish the roots of the potato plant. The rootstock (potato) acts as a stable and healthy root system and the scions (tomato) are chosen for their fruit, flowers or leaves. The tomatoes should be ready to harvest after about 12 weeks during the summer months, the potatoes should be ready after the tomato leaves begin <b>to</b> <b>die</b> <b>back,</b> normally in early autumn. Grafting in this way can be used to produce many different related crops from the same plant, for example the growing popularity of 'Fruit salad' trees, which is a single tree that produces multiple types of citrus fruits, or a tree with a variety of fruits with stones (peach, plum etc.).|$|E
50|$|Glyphosate {{is used as}} a pre-harvest {{herbicide}} {{and harvest}} aid on cereal crops including wheat and oats and on oil seed rape. As a systemic herbicide it is not a true desiccant as it can take weeks rather than days for the crop <b>to</b> <b>die</b> <b>back</b> after application. In the UK, it began to be applied to wheat crops in the 1980s to control perennial weeds such as common couch which was very effective and meant that sowing of the next crop could occur sooner. Use as a harvest aid in the UK increased after the introduction of strobilurin fungicides which prolong the longevity of the leaves, and in 2002, 12% of UK wheat crops were treated. The timing of application is crucial as the moisture content of the grain must be below 30% for the yield of the crop to be unaffected and to minimise uptake of glyphosate by the grain. Yield may be affected and residues increased if applications are made to uneven fields in which some areas have a moisture content over 30%. Although used in weed-free and evenly maturing crops with the aim of reducing the grain moisture content more rapidly to hasten the harvest, {{there is little or no}} advantage in doing so. Glyphosate was found in 5-15 % of cereal crop samples tested in the UK between 2000 and 2004, although never exceeding the Maximum Residue Level of 20 mg/kg. A survey of British wheat in 2006-8 found average levels of 0.05-0.22 mg/kg with maximum levels of 1.2 mg/kg. In July 2013 Austria banned the use of pre-harvest glyphosate citing the precautionary principle. In April 2015 an oat buyer in Western Canada announced that it was refusing oats in which pre-harvest glyphosate had been used.|$|E

40|$|Woody plant {{encroachment}} into semiarid ecosystems {{has become}} a global trend in recent decades. Due to stream channel incision, the semiarid riparian montane meadows of the southern Sierra Nevada Moun-tains, USA are experiencing long-term declines in soil moisture. A woody shrub, Artemisia rothrockii A. Gray (Rothrock sagebrush, Asteraceae) is invading these herbaceous meadows. We used {{an analysis of the}} stable oxygen isotope ratios of plant and soil water to measure the depth of plant water acquisition during the early stages of this woody plant encroachment. Sagebrush used deeper water on average than most herbs, but it also acquired 10 – 30 % of its water from shallow (< 30 cm) soil. Most of the young sagebrush seedlings (1 – 3 years old, < 15 cm) that we sampled used deep water like the older shrubs. Many, but not all of the herb species we sampled were also able to acquire deep water. These findings are consistent with a scenario of shrub encroachment in which channel incision causes shallow-water-dependent herbs <b>to</b> <b>die</b> <b>back,</b> allowing shrub seedlings to establish in disturbed areas during wet years. At least during {{the early stages of the}} invasion, some herbs appear to coexist with sagebrush by using deep root systems to cope with the declining shallow soil moisture...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} Siberian larch {{was carried out}} at {{the western edge of}} its area - in Vodlozersky National Park in the {{mid-range}} of Karelia. It was estimated that the larch grows only on the moraine ridges in association with Hylocomium group of forest types. Here it forms mixed stands with Norway spruce, Scots pine, less often - birch and aspen. These stands are characterized by high completeness, timber volume and quality class. Siberian larch trees are noted for their high age (130 years or more). The maximum height and stem diameter reach 40 m and 66 cm, respectively. At the foot of the moraine ridges the trees almost completely stopped growing in the last half a century and many of them began <b>to</b> <b>die</b> <b>back.</b> Perhaps this phenomenon is due to the artificial raising of the water level in the lake {{more than half a century}} ago which resulted in the hydrological regime of coastal phytocenoses causing waterlogging of the soil and, as a consequence, reduced intensity of growth processes in mesophytes. In the vertical structure of phytocenoses with Siberian larch up to 4 plant tiers are formed: the 1 st and 2 nd tier of the forest stand; the 3 rd - grassy and shrubby; the 4 th - mossy. The last two layers are usually developed very moderately, floristically poor and are noted for strong mosaic. There is no undergrowth. The reliable undergrowth of conifers is completely absent.
