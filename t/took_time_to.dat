5|$|Poor Luftwaffe {{administration}} {{meant the}} German defence <b>took</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{get the information}} from their radar sites. Major Harry von Bülow-Bothkamp—commanding II./JG 77—stated {{that it was the}} naval Freya, rather than Luftwaffe early warning sites that gave the alert. Owing to this, the RAF made landfall without interception. The first air-to-air shots were not traded until one hour after the Luftwaffe Freya made the initial report.|$|E

5|$|The Yugoslav coup d'état led to {{a sudden}} change in the plan of attack and confronted the Twelfth Army {{with a number of}} {{difficult}} problems. According to the 28 March Directive No. 25, the Twelfth Army was to create a mobile task force to attack via Niš toward Belgrade. With only nine days left before their final deployment, every hour became valuable and each fresh assembly of troops <b>took</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> mobilise. By the evening of 5 April, the forces intended to enter southern Yugoslavia and Greece had been assembled.|$|E

5|$|Upon release, Secret Rings {{received}} average reviews. Reviewers praised its visual {{style and}} considered the game as a whole to be an improvement from prior entries, but were critical of its controls, which some claimed <b>took</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get used to, and its inconsistent difficulty. Sega released a sequel in 2009, Sonic and the Black Knight; the two form {{what is known as}} the Sonic Storybook series. Sonic and the Secret Rings was de-listed from retailers in 2010, following Sega's decision to remove all Sonic titles with sub-average Metacritic scores in order to increase the value of the brand.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} {{transfer}} of forces in March 1901, further progress was slow as administrative and legislative instruments <b>took</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> develop. Indeed, {{it was not}} until 1 March 1904 that the Defence Act 1903 was proclaimed, providing the Commonwealth Military Forces a statutory framework within which they could operate. Amidst a background of political manoeuvring and personal agendas, the military forces were eventually reorganised into a more or less unified command structure. As a part of this, state-based mounted units were reformed into light horse regiments, supplemented by the transfer of men from a number of superfluous infantry units, while the remaining infantry were organised into battalions of the Australian Infantry Regiment and engineers and artillery were organised into field companies and garrison artillery batteries. Due to the provisions of the Defence Act which did not provide {{for the establishment of a}} regular infantry force, the notion that the Commonwealth Military Forces would be largely based on a part-time militia was set out in legislation.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{threw himself}} into Parliamentary work, begrudging the times when {{he was unable to}} attend debates and {{spending}} much time on committee work. When Austen Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer in the continued coalition government led by the Liberal Prime Minister, Lloyd George, tried to recruit him to serve on an additional committee, Neville Chamberlain informed his half-brother that he could only serve if it met between midnight and 7:30am. Chamberlain <b>took</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> assure the future of the Birmingham Savings Bank, and Parliament passed an act which removed onerous restrictions from the bank. In March 1920, he was offered a junior post at the Ministry of Health by Bonar Law on behalf of the Prime Minister, but was unwilling to serve under Lloyd George despite Bonar Law's warnings that Chamberlain, now past fifty, might never be offered another chance to serve in government, as Lloyd George was likely to remain premier for a very long time. Chamberlain was offered no further posts during Lloyd George's premiership, and when Bonar Law resigned as party leader, Austen Chamberlain took his place as head of the Unionists in Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war Woolley {{redirected}} the Commonwealth Observatory from solar research {{towards the}} study of stars and galaxies. It <b>took</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get the old and unused telescopes back up to working condition: they had to be overhauled and refurbished, and in one case rebuilt from scrap. Woolley got funding approval from the Prime Minister for construction of a 74-inch telescope, but it would not be finished for years. Gascoigne began to work in the nascent field of photoelectric photometry, using electrical devices to measure the brightness of stars more accurately than had been possible using photographic techniques. In 1951, with equipment brought by visiting astronomer Gerald Kron from California's Lick Observatory, he observed Cepheid variable stars, which are used to measure astronomical distances. Granted nine months of observing time on the Observatory's Reynolds 30-inch reflector telescope – an extraordinary opportunity – Gascoigne, Kron and others surveyed Cepheid stars in both the Small Magellanic Cloud and, later, the Large Magellanic Cloud. They also examined the colours of star clusters in the Small Cloud.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Macaulay took 130 wickets at {{an average}} of 18.26. However, he {{suffered}} a foot injury in 1928, and <b>took</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> recover his best form. His wicket tally fell to 120 and his average climbed to 24.37. His total of wickets decreased further to 102 in 1929 and his average remained above 20. Hampered by another foot injury throughout 1930, Macaulay failed to take 100 wickets {{for the first time since}} his debut season; his average of 25.12 was the highest of his career. In these seasons, he was only selected for one representative match, a Test trial in 1928 in which he failed to take a wicket. At the same time, his batting faded. In 1927, Macaulay scored his highest run aggregate and passed fifty six times while hitting 678 runs {{at an average}} of 25.11. He improved his batting average in 1928, accumulating 517 runs at 25.85 with four more fifties. However, after 1928, he never averaged more than 16.26 with the bat and only scored two more fifties in his career, both in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Since 1985 the {{government}} of Mobile has consisted of a mayor and a seven-member city council. The mayor is elected at-large, and the council members are elected {{from each of the}} seven city council single-member districts (SMDs). A supermajority of five votes is required to conduct council business. This form of city government was chosen by the voters after the previous form of government, which used three city commissioners who were elected at-large, was ruled to substantially dilute the minority vote and violate the Voting Rights Act in the 1975 case Bolden v. City of Mobile. Due to appeals, the case <b>took</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> reach settlement and establishment of a new electoral system. Municipal elections are held every four years.|$|E

5|$|The Kirk {{began to}} concern itself with {{providing}} {{churches in the}} new towns and relatively thinly supplied Highlands, establishing a church extension committee in 1828. Led by Thomas Chalmers, by the early 1840s it had added 222 churches, largely through public subscription. When the Great Disruption occurred in 1843, and roughly a third of ministers and their congregations left the established church and its buildings to form the Free Church of Scotland, Chalmers' organisational skills helped the Free Church build over 700 new places of worship by 1847. The established church <b>took</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> recover, but embarked on a rival programme of church building, increasing its number of parishes from 924 in 1843 to 1,437 by 1909. The intense competition between different denominations {{led to the creation}} of grand churches with tall steeples and ultimately resulted in an oversupply of churches, which would be a financial burden to future generations.|$|E
