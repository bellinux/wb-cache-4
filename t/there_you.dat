25|$|St James Park, {{most likely}} named after its road frontage, is {{predominantly}} used for croquet, cricket and soccer. It {{is probably one}} of the most beautiful parks in the city with tree lined walkways and gardens. The park in the heart of Papanui is probably the best location to see over-wintering monarch butterflies. On a warm sunny late autumn or early winter's day head to the children's play ground and look into the largely leafless old trees. <b>There</b> <b>you</b> will see monarchs clustering together often holding on to the remaining leaves for support. It ís a great spot for a picnic beneath the trees with monarchs fluttering in the air above.|$|E

All these things go through one's mind. Then if Michael had won...he would have had to ask me to join his government, and I didn't want that. I asked myself: why am I risking all this?

25|$|To access this region, two provincial roads: Provincial Route No. 28 (gravel), {{linking the}} towns of Tanti with Taninga (near the town of Salsacate). After {{traveling}} nearly 40km from Tanti, and climb over 1,700 meters you reach the far north of the region, more precisely {{at the foot of}} the massif 'Los Gigantes'. From <b>there</b> <b>you</b> can follow the same route to the town of Taninga. The second option is the provincial route RP 34 (tarmac), located about 30km south of the former. It crosses the city of Villa Carlos Paz, crossing {{the towns of}} San Antonio de Arredondo, Villa Icho Cruz, Mayu Sumaj, Cuesta Blanca, and deposited us in the Pampa de Achala. This road is also known as Camino de las Altas Cumbres or route Jorge Raúl Recalde, in tribute to this rally racer. Continuing along the same route, it accesses the Traslasierra Valley. While these are the two most relevant options, there are regional roads and tourist access to reach specific sectors within the region. As mentioned above, except for these two alternatives, the other, in most cases are suitable only for special vehicles, and yet they can not access certain areas.|$|E
