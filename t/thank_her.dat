5|$|The next day, Sasha {{leaves a}} pigeon at the ShadowClan border {{to prove to}} Tigerstar that kittypets can hunt. After {{catching}} a rabbit, Sasha is attacked by two foxes. Before she can escape, though, Tigerstar comes and attacks the duo of animals, telling her to run. Scrambling up a tree, Sasha sees that the foxes have an advantage over him, and she jumps down to assist him.

Skinner, however, dismisses his {{concerns}} and sends him home. While leaving, Doggett has a hallucination of Tipet, ordering him to kill Scully. Suddenly, Doggett finds himself in front of Scully. Rather than kill his partner, he turns the axe upon himself. Doggett is immediately awakened from his dark reverie and finds himself in his bedroom, with Scully standing over his bed.

25|$|Ranaghat {{town has}} existed since the British invaded India. A myth is still {{prevalent}} {{that the name}} of the town came from the bandit 'Rana Dacoit', who used to pillage this area 500 or 600 years back and he used to give pujas to the goddess Kali to <b>thank</b> <b>her.</b> A more likely origin for {{the name of the}} town comes from Rani (Queen) or Rana (a Rajput warrior) and Ghat (steps leading to the river).|$|E

500|$|At the library, {{her style}} was personal: she {{discussed}} with the patrons their interests, and she selected books she felt were appropriate. In 1886, she befriended and mentored the 10-year-old Jack London, guiding his reading. London called her his [...] "literary mother". Twenty years later, London wrote to Coolbrith to <b>thank</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

500|$|Raffald {{states in}} her Preface that she {{personally}} [...] "perused [...] {{as it came}} from the press, having an opportunity of having it printed by a neighbour, whom I can rely on". She writes that [...] "The whole work being now compleated to my wishes", she must <b>thank</b> <b>her</b> friends and subscribers; she states that over 800 of them contributed, [...] "raising me so large a subscription, which far excells my expectations". She was thus a self-publisher.|$|E

500|$|Although {{saying that}} she was in favour of [...] "peaceful negotiations" [...] to end apartheid, Thatcher opposed {{sanctions}} imposed on South Africa by the Commonwealth and the EC. She attempted to preserve trade with South Africa while persuading the government there to abandon apartheid. This included [...] "asting herself as President Botha's candid friend", and inviting him to visit the UK in 1984, in spite of the [...] "inevitable demonstrations" [...] against his government. Thatcher dismissed the African National Congress (ANC) in October 1987 as [...] "a typical terrorist organisation". During his visit to Britain five months after his release from prison, Nelson Mandela praised Thatcher: [...] "She is an enemy of apartheid... We have much to <b>thank</b> <b>her</b> for." ...|$|E
500|$|Although it {{had been}} {{suggested}} that Pauline's presence in EastEnders was largely peripheral for some time, the news of her departure in 2006 was met with dismay by fans and soap journalists alike. In a report for BBC News, one viewer commented [...] "it's so sad, because I've watched her for 20 years. She's such a large character", and another said [...] "If she goes then I think EastEnders is finished." [...] BBC controller of continuing drama, John Yorke, commented Richard [...] "occupies a huge place in people's hearts", and executive producer Kate Harwood said, [...] "For many years Wendy simply was EastEnders for the audience and Pauline's indomitable nature typified the grit and fight that embodies the EastEnders spirit... We <b>thank</b> <b>her</b> for everything she has done for the show." ...|$|E
500|$|Trouble {{arrives in}} the form of Sunny (Akshay Kumar), who shares a room with Sameer. He [...] meets Rani, falls in love with her and decides to {{capitalise}} on Sameer's mistakes. This causes friction between the roommates. Sameer gives Rani money she needs for a fashion competition, calling himself her [...] "well-wisher". Rani wins the competition, and wants to <b>thank</b> <b>her</b> [...] "well-wisher" [...] in person. Sameer (who gave Rani the money for his grandmother's eye surgery and his sister's wedding) goes to meet her but Sunny gets there first, claims to be the well-wisher and takes her away. Sameer follows on his motorcycle, and injures Singh later. Sunny, who takes credit for a painting of Rani by Sameer, kidnaps her dog Tommy and frames Sameer.

500|$|Speaking to The Observers Sue Arnold, Finch {{believed}} The Archers {{had done}} [...] "a great service for women's health" [...] by tackling {{the subject of}} breast cancer. Finch later revealed that she had received letters from listeners about the storyline and one woman wrote to <b>thank</b> <b>her</b> because she had found a lump in her breast after listening to the show. Finch also named the storyline {{as one of her}} Archers highlights. Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breakthrough said The Archers treated the subject of breast cancer [...] "as sensibly as one can reasonably expect." [...] Morgan continues saying that Breakthrough liked how the show had highlighted the effect that a cancer diagnosis can have on a partner. In contrast, the radio series Feedback reported that the storyline had initially attracted a negative response from listeners, who felt the subject should have been handled with more optimism.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Freedom" [...] is a hip hop and R {{song that}} follows a similar style to other Minaj songs heard on her debut album, Pink Friday. The song {{features}} street-slang bravado and [...] "venomous" [...] rapping in the verses with thin, fragile vocals over whipsy soft pop choruses. The instrumentation in [...] "Freedom" [...] mixes together smooth ambient riffs, pop-inspired crystal-clear synthesizers, and a smooth R beat, creating a sonically breezy soundscape. Lyrically, Minaj is still confrontational yet reflective, {{talking about her}} life in the spotlight and rise to fame. In the lyrics, Minaj states how other rappers [...] "in the competition" [...] will never <b>thank</b> <b>her</b> for opening the doors for them, and how they don't even thank their creator Jesus Christ for helping them get far, saying: [...] "They'll never thank me for opening doors / But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross / 'Cause your spirit is ungrateful, bitches is so hateful, I remain a staple." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{arriving}} back in England, Trenchard visited Lady Dudley to <b>thank</b> <b>her</b> {{and then set}} about engineering his return to South Africa. [...] His lung was not fully healed, causing him pain and leaving him breathless. [...] Furthermore, the War Office were sceptical about Trenchard's claim to be fully fit and were disinclined {{to allow him to}} forgo his remaining nine months of sick leave. [...] Trenchard then took several months of tennis coaching in order to strengthen his remaining lung. [...] Early in the summer of 1901 he entered two tennis competitions, reaching the semi-finals both times and gaining favourable press coverage. [...] He then sent the newspaper clippings to the doctors at the War Office, arguing that this tennis ability proved he was fit for active service. [...] Not waiting for a reply, Trenchard boarded a troop ship in May 1901, passing himself off as a volunteer for a second tour of duty.|$|E
