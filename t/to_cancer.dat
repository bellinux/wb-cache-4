5|$|In normal development, {{endogenous}} sonic hedgehog signaling stimulates rapid {{proliferation of}} cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) {{in the external}} granule layer (EGL). Cerebellar development occurs during late embryogenesis and the early postnatal period, with CGNP proliferation in the EGL peaking during early development (postnatal day 7 in the mouse). As CGNPs terminally differentiate into cerebellum granule cells (also called cerebellar granule neurons, CGNs), they migrate to the internal granule layer (IGL), forming the mature cerebellum (by post-natal day 20 in the mouse). Mutations that abnormally activate Sonic hedgehog signaling predispose <b>to</b> <b>cancer</b> of the cerebellum (medulloblastoma) in humans with Gorlin Syndrome and in genetically engineered mouse models.|$|E

Vitamin A and E supplements not only provide no health benefits for generally healthy individuals, but they may increase mortality, though the two large studies that support this conclusion included smokers for whom it was already known that beta-carotene supplements can be harmful. While other findings suggest that vitamin E toxicity is limited to only a specific form when taken in excess.|$|E
