The recipients of these copies were not initially identified. Since then, two of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> named. One is Barry Cunningham, Rowling's very first editor. Another is Arthur A. Levine, editor for Scholastic, the U.S. publisher of the Harry Potter books. Cunningham and Levine had lent their personal copies as part of Beedle the Bard exhibits in December 2008.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} human habitation on Lewis {{is found in}} peat samples which indicate that about 8,000 years ago much of the native woodland was torched {{to make way for}} grassland to allow deer to graze. The earliest archaeological remains date from about 5,000 years ago. At that time, people began to settle in permanent farms rather than following their herds. The small houses of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found throughout the Western Isles; in particular, at Dail Mhor, Carloway. The more striking great monuments of this period are the temples and communal burial cairns at places like Calanais.|$|E

She also said that the album centred on her [...] "not being able to leave [...] for 18 months" [...] and feeling [...] "disconnected". She summed up the album's main theme as information politics. During the recording of the album, she spoke of the combined effects that news corporations and Google have on news and data collection, while stressing the need for alternative news sources that she felt her son's generation would need to ascertain truth. Maya was made to be [...] "so uncomfortably weird and wrong that people begin to exercise their critical-thinking muscles". M.I.A. said [...] "You can Google 'Sri Lanka' and it doesn't come up that all <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> murdered or bombed, it's 'Come to Sri Lanka on vacation, there are beautiful beaches' ... you're not gonna get the truth till you hit like, page 56, and it's my and your responsibility to pass on the information that it's not easy anymore". Following these comments, M.I.A. received death threats directed at her and her son, which she also cited as an influence on the songs on the album. She summed up the album as a mixture of [...] "babies, death, destruction and powerlessness". The singer revealed that going into recording the album, she had still not accepted that she was a musician, saying [...] "I'm still in denial, listening to too much Destiny's Child". With Maya, she stated [...] "I was happy being the retarded cousin of rap... Now I'm the retarded cousin of singing." ...|$|E

60|$|We {{were off}} in a char with the dawn. Of course you will {{understand}} that we entered the Valais by its famous bridge, and passed St. Maurice, and the water-fall à la Teniers; for you have already travelled along this road with me. I {{saw no reason to}} change my opinion of the Valais, which looked as chill and repulsive now as it did in 1828, though we were so early on the road as to escape the horrible sight of the basking crétins, most of whom were still housed.

60|$|Let {{it not be}} {{supposed}} that I have overdrawn this picture. I have not done so. Nor let it be urged, that the hostility of this tribe to foreigners, and the hereditary feuds they carry on against their fellow-islanders beyond the mountains, are facts which contradict me. Not so; these apparent discrepancies are easily reconciled. By many a legendary tale of violence and wrong, {{as well as by}} events which have passed before their eyes, <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> taught to look upon white men with abhorrence. The cruel invasion of their country by Porter has alone furnished them with ample provocation; and I can sympathize in the spirit which prompts the Typee warrior to guard all the passes to his valley with the point of his levelled spear, and, standing upon the beach, with his back turned upon his green home, to hold at bay the intruding European.|$|E

Many of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> out to Blackheath; some have stayed there with the mob, while others have brought back news of their doings. Among the rabble on Blackheath are many hedge priests; notably, I hear, one John Ball, a pestilent knave, who preaches treason to them, and tells them that as all men are equal, so all the goods of those of the better class should be divided among those having nothing, a doctrine which pleases the rascals mightily." ...|$|E
60|$|These {{first real}} human beings {{we know of}} in Europe appear already to have belonged to one or other {{of at least two}} very {{distinct}} races. One of these races was of a very high type indeed; it was tall and big brained. One of the women's skulls found exceeds in capacity that of the average man of to-day. One of the men's skeletons is over six feet in height. The physical type resembled that of the North American Indian. From the Cro-Magnon cave in which the first skeletons were found <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> called Cro-Magnards. They were savages, but savages of a high order. The second race, the race of the Grimaldi cave remains, was distinctly negroid in its characters. Its nearest living affinities are the Bushmen and Hottentots of South Africa. It is interesting to find at the very outset of the known human story, that mankind was already racially divided into at least two main varieties; and one is tempted to such unwarrantable guesses as that the former race was probably brownish rather than black and that it came from the East or North, and that the latter was blackish rather than brown and came from the equatorial south.|$|E

6000|$|We then {{marched through}} the bazaars, that were lofty and grim, and pretty full of people. In a desolate broken building, some {{hundreds}} of children were playing and singing; in many corners sat parties over their water-pipes, one of whom {{every now and then}} would begin twanging out a most queer chant; others there were playing at casino--a crowd squatted around the squalling gamblers, and talking and looking on with eager interest. In one place of the bazaar we found a hundred people at least listening to a story- teller who delivered his tale with excellent action, voice, and volubility: in another they were playing a sort of thimble-rig with coffee-cups, all intent upon the game, and the player himself very wild lest one of our party, who had discovered where the pea lay, should tell the company. The devotion and energy with which all these pastimes were pursued, struck me as much as anything. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> playing thimble-rig and casino; that story- teller has been shouting his tale of Antar for forty years; and they are just as happy with this amusement now as when first they tried it.

60|$|If {{they had}} not {{constantly}} been apprised of all the enormities committed in India under their authority, if this state of things had been as much a discovery to them {{as it was to}} many of us, we might flatter ourselves that the detection of the abuses would lead to their reformation. I will go further. If the Court of Directors had not uniformly condemned every act which this House or any of its committees had condemned, if the language in which they expressed their disapprobation against enormities and their authors had not been much more vehement and indignant than any ever used in this House, I should entertain some hopes. If {{they had not}}, on the other hand, as uniformly commended all their servants who had done their duty and obeyed their orders as they had heavily censured those who rebelled, I might say, <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in an error, and when they are sensible of it they will mend. But when I reflect on the uniformity of their support to the objects of their uniform censure, and the state of insignificance and disgrace to which all of those have been reduced whom they approved, and that even utter ruin and premature death have been among the fruits of their favor, I must be convinced, that in this case, as in all others, hypocrisy is the only vice that never can be cured.|$|E
60|$|Your Committee {{think it}} hardly {{necessary}} to observe, that the many changes of plan which {{have taken place}} in the management of the salt trade are far from honorable to the Company's government,--and that, even if the monopoly of this article were a profitable concern, it should not be permitted. Exclusive of the general effect of this and of all monopolies, the oppressions which the manufacturers of salt, called molungees, still suffer under it, though perhaps alleviated in some particulars, deserve particular attention. There is evidence enough on the Company's records to satisfy your Committee that <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> treated with great rigor, and not only defrauded of the due payment of their labor, but delivered over, like cattle, in succession, to different masters, who, under pretence of buying up the balances due to their preceding employers, find means of keeping them in perpetual slavery. For evils of this nature there can be no perfect remedy as long as the monopoly continues. They are {{in the nature of the}} thing, and cannot be cured, or effectually counteracted, even by a just and vigilant administration on the spot. Many objections occur to the farming of any branch of the public revenue in Bengal, particularly against farming the salt lands. But the dilemma to which government by this system is constantly reduced, of authorizing great injustice or suffering great loss, is alone sufficient to condemn it. Either government is expected to support the farmer or contractor in all his pretensions by an exertion of power, which tends of necessity to the ruin of the parties subjected to the farmer's contract, and to the suppression of free trade,--or, if such assistance be refused him, he complains that he is not supported, that private persons interfere with his contract, that the manufacturers desert their labor, and that proportionate deductions must be allowed him.|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} the {{settlement}} of Rezzonico are also debated.
