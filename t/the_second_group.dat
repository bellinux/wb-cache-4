5|$|Justus was {{a member}} of the Gregorian mission sent to England by Pope GregoryI. Almost {{everything}} known about Justus and his career is derived from the early 8th-century Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum of Bede. As Bede does not describe Justus' origins, nothing is known about him prior to his arrival in England. He probably arrived in England with <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>group</b> of missionaries, sent at the request of Augustine of Canterbury in 601. Some modern writers describe Justus as one of the original missionaries who arrived with Augustine in 597, but Bede believed that Justus came in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>group.</b> <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>group</b> included Mellitus, who later became Bishop of London and Archbishop of Canterbury.|$|E

He was {{probably}} an Italian by birth. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>group</b> of missionaries arrived in Kent by 604, but little is known of Paulinus' further activities until he went to Northumbria.|$|E
