5|$|Both the {{guillemot}} tick Ixodes uriae and <b>the</b> <b>flea</b> Ornithopsylla laetitiae (probably {{originally a}} rabbit flea) {{have been recorded}} from the nests of puffins. Other fleas which have been found on the birds include Ceratophyllus borealis, Ceratophyllus gallinae, Ceratophyllus garei, Ceratophyllus vagabunda and the common rabbit flea Spilopsyllus cuniculi.|$|E
5|$|Feather mites of {{at least}} two species have been found on the storm petrel, with Halipeurus pelagicus {{occurring}} at much higher densities than Philoceanus robertsi. <b>The</b> <b>flea</b> Xenopsylla gratiosa and dermanyssid mites are commonly found, with lower numbers of ticks. These blood-sucking parasites slow the growth rate of nestlings and may affect their survival rate.|$|E

25|$|Fleas* cause itching {{and hair}} loss. <b>The</b> most common <b>flea</b> in dogs is <b>the</b> cat <b>flea,</b> Ctenocephalides felis, {{followed}} by <b>the</b> dog <b>flea,</b> C. canis.|$|R
5|$|Fleas feed on a {{wide variety}} of warm-blooded {{vertebrates}} including humans, dogs, cats, rabbits, squirrels, ferrets, rats, mice and birds. Fleas normally specialise in one host species or group of species, but can often feed but not reproduce on other species. Ceratophyllus gallinae affects poultry as well as wild birds. As well as the degree of relatedness of a potential host to the flea's original host, it has been shown that avian fleas that exploit a range of hosts, only parasitise species with low immune responses. In general, host specificity decreases as the size of the host species decreases. Another factor is the opportunities available to <b>the</b> <b>flea</b> to change host species; this is smaller in colonially nesting birds, where <b>the</b> <b>flea</b> may never encounter another species, than it is in solitary nesting birds. A large, long-lived host provides a stable environment that favours host-specific parasites.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} {{is also a}} host to <b>the</b> <b>flea</b> Ceratophyllus borealis, and several other flea species in the genera Ceratophyllus and Dasypsyllus. The Eurasian rock pipit can benefit from {{parasitism}} of the common periwinkle Littorina littoria by the castrating trematode Parorchis acanthus. Beaches can become attractive where {{the decline of the}} periwinkle results in more ungrazed algae, with corresponding increases in invertebrates and a greater diversity of smaller Littorina snails as food for the pipits.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other insects, fleas do {{not possess}} {{compound}} eyes but instead only have simple eyespots with a single biconvex lens; some species lack eyes altogether. Their bodies are laterally compressed, permitting easy movement through the hairs or feathers on the host's body (or {{in the case of}} humans, under clothing). <b>The</b> <b>flea</b> body is covered with hard plates called sclerites. These sclerites are covered with many hairs and short spines directed backward, which also assist its movements on the host. The tough body is able to withstand great pressure, likely an adaptation to survive attempts to eliminate them by scratching.|$|E

5|$|Adult Psylliodes luridipennis beetles are {{invariably}} {{found on}} the Lundy cabbage (Coincya wrightii), a species endemic to the island of Lundy, where they feed on the leaves. They are not found on other locally occurring plants. However, researchers were also able to lure the beetles onto other crucifers taken from gardens. Two other taxa are known only from Lundy cabbages—the true weevil Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes and an undescribed race of <b>the</b> <b>flea</b> beetle Psylliodes napi—making the plant unique to Britain as the only endemic species which is the exclusive host to endemic insect species. However, the Lundy cabbage is also host to a diverse variety of other invertebrate species.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reproduction}} occurs {{around the}} year, {{there is a}} peak during the summer (November to April). Molting mostly occurs during autumn and winter (April to August). At one locality in Mendoza, Akodon spegazzinii occurs at an estimated density of 21 individuals per hectare (8.5 per acre) and has a home range size of about 300 m2 (3200sqft). A number of sigmodontines have been recorded as occurring with A.spegazzinii, including A.caenosus, A.simulator, Neotomys ebriosus, Abrothrix illuteus, Reithrodon auritus, Andinomys edax, and various species of Eligmodontia, Necromys, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Oxymycterus, and Phyllotis. The tick Ixodes sigelos has been recorded on A.spegazzinii in Tucumán. In addition, the mites Androlaelaps fahrenholzi, Androlaelaps rotundus, and Eulaelaps stabularis and <b>the</b> <b>flea</b> Cleopsylla townsendii are known from the species.|$|E
5|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>flea</b> reaches adulthood, {{its primary}} goal is to find blood and then to reproduce. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, {{permitting}} rapid increase in numbers. Generally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host to provide a blood meal, a flea's life can be as short as a few days. Under ideal conditions of temperature, food supply, and humidity, adult fleas can live {{for up to a}} year and a half. Completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, so long as they do not emerge from their puparia. Optimum temperatures for the flea's life cycle are 21°C to 30°C (70°F to 85°F) and optimum humidity is 70%.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flea's</b> body is {{only about}} one tenth of an inch long (about 0.1 in). A flea's body is {{constructed}} {{to make it easier}} to jump long distances. <b>The</b> <b>flea's</b> body consists of three regions: head, thorax, and abdomen. The head and the thorax have rows of bristles (called combs), and the abdomen consists of eight visible segments.|$|R

5|$|External parasites of the {{mistle thrush}} include <b>the</b> hen <b>flea,</b> <b>the</b> moorhen <b>flea,</b> <b>the</b> {{castor bean tick}} and the brightly {{coloured}} harvest mite. Internally, the thrush may be hosting tapeworms, nematodes, and Syngamus merulae a relative of the gapeworm. Blood parasites include Trypanosoma and Plasmodium species.|$|R
5|$|The {{number of}} eggs laid depends on species, with batch sizes ranging {{from two to}} several dozen. The total number of eggs {{produced}} in a female's lifetime (fecundity) varies from around one hundred to several thousand. In some species, <b>the</b> <b>flea</b> lives in the nest or burrow and the eggs are deposited on the substrate, but in others, the eggs are laid on the host itself and can easily fall off onto the ground. Because of this, areas where the host rests and sleeps {{become one of the}} primary habitats of eggs and developing larvae. The eggs take around two days to two weeks to hatch. Experiments have shown that fleas lay more eggs on hosts which have limited food intakes, and that eggs and larvae survive better under these conditions, perhaps because the host's immune system is compromised.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduced}} snake Boa constrictor preys on O.couesi on Cozumel. Parasites {{recorded on}} O.couesi in Veracruz include unidentified ticks, mites, fleas, and fly larvae. <b>The</b> <b>flea</b> Polygenis odiosus {{was found on}} an Oryzomys couesi from Cozumel. Out of ten O.couesi in San Luis Potosí, five each were infected by the nematode worms Hassalstrongylus musculi and H.bocqueti, with about 25 worms per rat, and two were infected by one or two cestodes of the genus Raillietina. The mites Eubrachylaelaps circularis and Gigantolaelaps boneti have been found on Oryzomys couesi in Oaxaca, the sucking louse Hoplopleura oryzomydis in Nicaragua, the mites Laelaps oryzomydis, Echinonyssus microchelae, Ornithonyssus bacoti, Prolistrophorus frontalis, and Prolistrophorus bakeri in Colima, and the apicomplexan Eimeria couesii in Mexico. The species is infected by two hantaviruses—Catacamas virus in Honduras and Playa de Oro virus in western Mexico—which {{are related to the}} Bayou virus infecting the marsh rice rat, a common cause of hantavirus infections in the United States. No hantavirus infections in humans have been linked to O.couesi hantaviruses, however. Chiapas O.couesi easily survive experimental infection with several arboviruses, including the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, suggesting that the species may serve as a reservoir for that virus.|$|E

5|$|Adult female rabbit fleas, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, {{can detect}} the {{changing}} levels of cortisol and corticosterone hormones in the rabbit's blood that indicate {{it is getting}} close to giving birth. This triggers sexual maturity in <b>the</b> <b>fleas</b> and they start producing eggs. As soon as the baby rabbits are born, <b>the</b> <b>fleas</b> make their way down to them and once on board they start feeding, mating, and laying eggs. After 12 days, <b>the</b> adult <b>fleas</b> make {{their way back to}} the mother. They complete this mini-migration every time she gives birth.|$|R

25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, rats did not {{directly}} start {{the spread of the}} bubonic plague. It is mainly a disease in the fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) that infested the rats, making the rats themselves the first victims of the plague. Infection in a human occurs when a person is bitten by a flea that has been infected by biting a rodent that itself has been infected by the bite of a flea carrying the disease. The bacteria multiply inside <b>the</b> <b>flea,</b> sticking together to form a plug that blocks its stomach and causes it to starve. <b>The</b> <b>flea</b> then bites a host and continues to feed, even though it cannot quell its hunger, and consequently <b>the</b> <b>flea</b> vomits blood tainted with the bacteria back into the bite wound. The bubonic plague bacterium then infects a new person, and <b>the</b> <b>flea</b> eventually dies from starvation. Serious outbreaks of plague are usually started by other disease outbreaks in rodents, or a rise in the rodent population.|$|E
25|$|Bubonic plague is an {{infection}} of the lymphatic system, usually resulting from the bite of an infected flea, Xenopsylla cheopis (the rat flea). In very rare circumstances, as in the septicemic plague, the disease can be transmitted by direct contact with infected tissue or exposure to the cough of another human. <b>The</b> <b>flea</b> is parasitic on house and field rats, and seeks out other prey when its rodent hosts die. The bacteria remain harmless to <b>the</b> <b>flea,</b> allowing the new host to spread the bacteria. The bacteria form aggregates in the gut of infected fleas and this results in <b>the</b> <b>flea</b> regurgitating ingested blood, which is now infected, into the bite site of a rodent or human host. Once established, bacteria rapidly spread to the lymph nodes and multiply.|$|E

25|$|Fleas {{can jump}} {{vertically}} up to 18cm and horizontally up to 33cm, however, although {{this form of}} locomotion is initiated by <b>the</b> <b>flea,</b> it has little control of the jump - they always jump in the same direction, with very little variation in the trajectory between individual jumps.|$|E
