It is that continuing influence, embodied in the magnificent series of films he has given the world, during the last half-century, that will preserve his great spirit, his humour and his wit, not only for us but for succeeding generations of film-goers.|$|E

She wrote to a friend, Charlotte Murchison, in November of that year: [...] "Perhaps you will laugh when I say that <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> old faithful dog has quite upset me, the cliff that fell upon him and killed him in a moment before my eyes, and close to my feet ... it was but a moment {{between me and the}} same fate." ...|$|E

500|$|Virginia's {{death had}} a {{significant}} effect on Poe. After her death, Poe was deeply saddened for several months. A friend said of him, [...] "the loss of his wife was a sad blow to him. He did not seem to care, after she was gone, whether he lived an hour, a day, a week or a year; she was his all." [...] A year after her death, he wrote to a friend that he had experienced the greatest evil a man can suffer when, he said, [...] "a wife, whom I loved as no man ever loved before", had fallen ill. While Virginia was still struggling to recover, Poe turned to alcohol after abstaining for quite some time. How often and how much he drank is a controversial issue, debated in Poe's lifetime and also by modern biographers. Poe referred to his emotional response to his wife's sickness as his own illness, and that he found the cure to it [...] "in <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> wife. This I can & do endure as becomes a manit was the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope & despair which I could not longer have endured without the total loss of reason".|$|E
500|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Lady Rosebery drove her husband to follow her own political agenda, or that of her family. For her the rewards seem to have been the pleasure of seeing a husband she undoubtedly adored in the high office of which she felt him worthy. There is no doubt that she tempered her husband's more radical views. Immediately following his wife's death Rosebery retired from politics, writing in October 1891 [...] "The sole object of my ambition has disappeared with <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> wife." [...] Proof of the widespread belief in society that Lady Rosebery was the stable element of the partnership was confirmed shortly after her death, by Queen Victoria, following a then rare public speech by Rosebery, in which he supported Home Rule for Ireland. The Queen was shocked and thought the speech [...] "almost communistic" [...] and went on to attribute Rosebery's [...] "shocking and disappointing" [...] behaviour to the fact that [...] "poor Lady Rosebery is not there to keep him back." [...] While Queen Victoria always personally liked Rosebery, she mistrusted his politics. The Queen had thoroughly liked Lady Rosebery and wrote Rosebery several letters of condolence, likening his loss to the untimely death of her own consort, Prince Albert. It seems that the Queen's antipathy to Jews was confined to elevating them to the peerage. This view had softened by 1885. In 1890 she accepted a luncheon invitation from Lady Rosebery's cousin Ferdinand de Rothschild and toured Waddesdon Manor albeit eating in a separate dining room to the Jewish members of the party.|$|E

2500|$|The year 1913 was for Bourguiba an {{important}} one: Working harder on his studies, he obtained his Certificat d'études primaires which dispensed him of military servitude {{by order of}} a beylical decree and to the grand relief of his father.

However, his joy did not last: On October 1, he went back to Tunis in order to start the year in Sadiki College but {{during the first week of}} November 1913, [...] "the superintendent called me out of class and announced me <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mother", Bourguiba stated in 1973. [...] "I immediately returned to Monastir where I found my whole family surrounding my mother lying on the deathbed [...] <b>The</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mother had deeply shaken me.

As for him, no other event has been rougher that his mother's death: Neither his future remoteness in Bordj le Bœuf years later, nor his imprisonment in the Fort Saint-Nicolas in Marseille nor even his exile in Cairo. He stated that he had at least made her proud by obtaining his certificat d'étude primaire.|$|E

2500|$|The First Lady {{was deeply}} {{affected}} by the death and entered a state of depression afterward. However, losing their child had {{a positive impact on}} the marriage, bringing the couple closer together in their shared grief. Arthur Schlesinger wrote that while President Kennedy always [...] "regarded Jacqueline with genuine affection and pride," [...] their marriage [...] "never seemed more solid than in the later months of 1963." [...] Aware of her depression, Kennedy's friend Aristotle Onassis invited her to his yacht. Despite President Kennedy initially having reservations, he reportedly believed that it would be [...] "good for her." [...] The trip was widely disapproved of within the Kennedy administration and by much of the general public, as well as in Congress. The First Lady returned to the United States on October 17, 1963.

2500|$|Nonetheless, in November 2004 {{an issue}} of Point de Vue had {{announced}} that henceforth the magazine would accord the Bonapartist title of pretence, [...] "the Prince Napoleon", to Jean-Christophe, whereas since 1997 that title had been attributed to Charles. This decision followed receipt by the magazine of a protest from Jean-Marc Varaut, prompted by publication in an earlier issue of a reference to Charles as [...] "head of the Imperial house". Point de Vue, which sometimes gazettes monarchist announcements, published Varaut's re-assertion of the dynastic exclusion of Charles along with the prince's response: [...] "...the title of 'head of family' among the Bonapartes devolves, at {{the death of the}} father, upon his eldest son. That rule is not susceptible to modification by the titleholder, a fortiori when the motives involved are petty and contrary to the Civil Code.

2500|$|... “It {{frequently}} {{happens that}} men {{bleed to death}} before assistance can be procured, or lose so much blood {{as not to be}} able to go through an operation. In order to prevent this, it has been proposed, and on some occasions practised, to make each man carry about him a garter, or piece of rope yarn, in order to bind up a limb in case of profuse bleeding. If it be objected, that this, from its solemnity may be apt to intimidate common men, officers at least should make use of some precaution, especially as many of them, and those of the highest rank, are stationed on the quarter deck, which is one of the most exposed situations, and far removed from the cockpit, where the surgeon and his assistants are placed. This was the cause of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> friend Captain Bayne, of the Alfred, who having had his knee so shattered with round shot that it was necessary to amputate the limb, expired under the operation, in consequence of the weakness induced by loss of blood in carrying him so far. As the Admiral on these occasions allowed me the honour of being at his side, I carried in my pocket several tourniquets of a simple construction, in case that accidents to any person on the quarter deck should have required their use.” ...|$|E

2500|$|After Elijah's {{confrontation}} with Ahab, God {{tells him to}} flee out of Israel, to a hiding place by the brook Chorath, east of the Jordan, where he will be fed by ravens. When the brook dries up, God sends him to a widow living {{in the town of}} Zarephath in Phoenicia. When Elijah finds her and asks to be fed, she says that she does not have sufficient food to keep her and her own son alive. Elijah tells her that God will not allow her supply of flour or oil to run out, saying, “Do not be afraid ... For thus says the Lord the God of Israel: The jar of meal will not be emptied and the jug of oil will not fail until the day that the Lord sends rain on the earth.” She feeds him the last of their food, and Elijah's promise miraculously comes true. God gave her [...] "manna" [...] from heaven even while he was withholding food from his unfaithful people in the promised land. Some time later the widow's son dies and the widow cries, [...] "You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to cause <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> son!" [...] Elijah prays that God might restore her son so that the trustworthiness of God's word might be demonstrated. 1 Kings 17:22 relates how God [...] "listened to the voice of Elijah; the life of the child came into him again, and he revived." [...] This is the first instance of raising the dead recorded in Scripture. This non-Israelite widow was granted the life of her son, the only hope for a widow in ancient society.
