40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design of}} a DSP based air detector system to prevent air embolism during Hemodialysis, which is a treatment option for kidney failure disease. Hemodialysis consists of removing blood from the body, filtering and treating the blood to remove toxic substances such as wastes and fluids, reestablishing proper chemical levels in the blood and returning the processed blood to the body. The functions of hemodialysis are performed {{through the use of a}} dialyzer, which is also known as an artificial kidney. During hemodialysis small air bubbles may infiltrate the tubing used during the therapy and combine to form larger air bubbles that are harmful to the patient. If an air bubble is large enough and enters the patient 2 ̆ 7 s circulatory system, the blood flow can be blocked and the patient can die by embolism. Most of the hemodialysis instruments in use today are equipped with air detection systems, which are based on analog design and digital microcontroll ers. This thesis presents a design method based strictly on DSP technology. The Motorola DSP 56824 EVM was considered suitable for this biomedical application since its performance parameters include high-speed, multi-signal control capability, reliability and stability. These performance parameters are considered to be the most important when designing biomedical instruments dealing with human beings 2 ̆ 7 life and safety. The objective of this research was the development and implementation of a DSP algorithm for the detection and measurement of the sizes of air bubbles in a fluid. In addition the algorithm had to possess the capability, when appropriate, to initiate protective and awareness measures such as triggering a <b>tube</b> <b>clamp</b> as well as activating visual and audio alarms. The air detection was accomplished by means of a commercial air detector module, which was based on piezo ceramic and ultrasound sensing. The function of the tubing clamp was to stop the fluid flow in the tub ing and prevent an air bubble from entering the patient 2 ̆ 7 s circulatory system. A secondary goal of this research was to exploit the capability of the DSP 56824 EVM and demonstrate its suitability for biomedical applications...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the safety and}} complications of chest <b>tube</b> <b>clamping,</b> a retrospective chart review was conducted at Baylor University Medical Center's level I trauma center. The records of 243 patients with pneumothoraces, hemothoraces, or a combination were identified and analyzed; 134 patients underwent clamping according to the care path, and 109 did not. The demographic characteristics of age, gender, and mechanism of injury were similar in both groups, as was the frequency of pneumothoraces, hemothoraces, and combined hemo/pneumothoraces. Subsequent radiographs showing recurrence or patient symptoms were noted in 13 patients (9. 7 %), requiring unclamping. Nine patients (6. 7 %) who had passed the clamping trial prior to removal required reinsertion of a chest tube due to recurrent pneumothoraces. One clamped patient required urgent insertion of a second thoracostomy tube due to occlusive thrombus within the residing chest tube. No deaths were documented {{as a result of}} the care path or of clamping. Overall, the <b>clamped</b> chest <b>tube</b> allows for more definitive assessment of persistent occult air leaks based on a 6 -hour chest radiograph and avoidance of premature removal and did not appear to have any adverse effects on patient safety. Further refinements of the clamping procedure may be needed, as some patients still required reinsertion despite an absence of pneumothorax after a 6 -hour clamping trial. Given these data, a prospective study with clamping is warranted to evaluate whether or not such a system can increase the speed with which chest tubes are removed and decrease the length of stay while maintaining patient safety...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The {{resonant}} behaviour of slotted <b>tubes,</b> <b>clamped</b> {{at one end}} but free at the other, has been investigated to {{determine the influence of}} slot length upon their characteristic normal modes. FEM simulations have been performed for a series of steel tubes, identical apart from having slots of different lengths, but constant equal widths, running parallel to their symmetry axes. Three dimensional visualizations of the results allowed different modal classes to be identified. The lower frequency region of the spectrum was dominated by longitudinal, breathing and transverse modes. Other classes, such as oval modes, appeared progressively as the frequency increased. The results were checked experimentally using ESPI to view the tubes while exciting them using a magnetic transducer. This provided experimental confirmation of the mode classifications. It was found that the frequencies of the transverse modes and of the breathing modes were lowered as the slot was lengthened. The frequencies of the longitudinal modes were almost unaffected by slots of any size. Where modes occurred in degenerate pairs, always as predicted by group representation theory, the splitting increased with slot length. This was by as much as 100 % of the lower frequency in the case of higher order transverse modes. From the FEM simulations a previously unknown type of modal form has been observed. These “modes” appeared in families but only in cases with longer slits. They have non-zero amplitude only {{around the edges of the}} slit.

40|$|Background: Animal {{models of}} {{asphyxiation}} cardiac arrest (ACA) are frequently used in basic research to mirror the clinical course of cardiac arrest (CA). The {{rates of the}} return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in ACA animal models are lower than those from studies that have utilized ventricular fibrillation (VF) animal models. The {{purpose of this study}} was to characterize the factors associated with the ROSC in the ACA porcine model. Methods: Forty-eight healthy miniature pigs underwent endotracheal <b>tube</b> <b>clamping</b> to induce CA. Once induced, CA was maintained untreated for a period of 8 min. Two minutes following the initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), defibrillation was attempted until ROSC was achieved or the animal died. To assess the factors associated with ROSC in this CA model, logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze gender, the time of preparation, the amplitude spectrum area (AMSA) from the beginning of CPR and the pH at the beginning of CPR. A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the predictive value of AMSA for ROSC. Results: ROSC was only 52. 1 % successful in this ACA porcine model. The multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that ROSC significantly depended on the time of preparation, AMSA at the beginning of CPR and pH at the beginning of CPR. The area under the ROC curve in for AMSA at the beginning of CPR was 0. 878 successful in predicting ROSC (95 % confidence intervals: 0. 773 ∼ 0. 983), and the optimum cut-off value was 15. 62 (specificity 95. 7 % and sensitivity 80. 0 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Significant {{morbidity}} and mortality result from the ineffective evacuation of empyema. Failure of conventional first line treatment with closed intercostal tube drainage and antibiotic therapy may result in fibrin deposition and loculated empyema. Enzymatic debridement using intrapleural instillation of streptokinase is a non-invasive therapeutic option which may obviate the need for surgical intervention. METHODS [...] Eleven adults with multiloculated post-pneumonic empyemas who had failed {{to respond satisfactorily to}} intercostal tube drainage and antibiotic therapy were treated with intrapleural streptokinase between November 1992 and January 1994. A small catheter was inserted under ultrasound guidance into a loculation within the pleural space. Aliquots of 250, 000 units of streptokinase in 100 ml normal saline were instilled into the pleural cavity and the <b>tube</b> <b>clamped</b> for four hours. Response was assessed by clinical outcome, measurement of drain output after unclamping, and subsequent pleural ultrasound, chest radiography, or both. RESULTS [...] Streptokinase enhanced drainage in all patients. Complete resolution of the empyema with re-expansion of the underlying lung was effected in eight patients, all of whom remain well. Further resolution of minimal pleural thickening was shown on subsequent chest radiographs. Two patients with considerably thickened visceral pleura following empyema drainage underwent successful decortication. The other, with myocarditis and a pyopneumothorax, underwent surgery for non-resolution of the pneumothorax but died perioperatively from cardiac failure. The number of streptokinase instillations per patient ranged from two to six (median three), and the volume of empyema fluid drained per patient ranged from 100 ml to 4870 ml (median 900 ml). Streptokinase was well tolerated in all patients. CONCLUSIONS [...] Intrapleural streptokinase is an effective adjunct in the management of complicated empyema and may reduce the need for surgery...|$|R
40|$|In certain {{parameter}} regimes, {{steady flow}} through flexible tubes is unstable to self-excited oscillations. Whittaker et al. (2010, Proc. Roy. Soc. A 466) solved an asymptotic {{model for the}} onset of self-excited oscillations in a long, thin-walled,flexible <b>tube</b> <b>clamped</b> between two rigid tubes, with a large axial tension. This work neglected effects such as wall inertia, axial bending, and in-plane shear forces. Whittaker (2015, IMA J. Appl. Math.) reintroduced in-plane shearing and found a shear-relaxation boundary layer at the tube ends. In this thesis,wall inertia and axial bending are reintroduced into these models. In Chapter 2, wall inertia terms {{are added to the}} governing equations for the wall mechanics, and a new ‘tube law’ describing the wall motion is derived. Combining this with a description of the fluid mechanics, the effect of wall inertia on the oscillations is quantified. Wall inertia is found to be a destabilising effect. In Chapters 3 – 7, axial bending is reintroduced allowing ‘clamped’ boundaryconditions to be satisfied at the tube ends. Three different regimes dependent on the dimensionless length and wall thickness of the tube are found. Chapters 4 – 5 concentrate on the two regimes where the shear layer found by Whittaker (2015) must be considered. An axial bending boundary layer that induces higher-order corrections to the shear layer and bulk solution is found in these regimes. In Chapters 6 – 7, a final regime is considered where the shear layer no longer needs consideration, but a new model for the wall mechanics is needed. Deriving and solving a linearised 2 D model for bending a semi-infinite block under tension, corresponding to a 2 D cross-section of the tube wall, a new transverse shear-relaxation layer is found. This boundary layer allows clamped boundary conditions to be satisfied and induces higher-order corrections to the bulk solution...|$|R

DESIGN Prospective, controlled, laboratory investigation using an asphyxial canine cardiac arrest model and a newly-developed esophageal flat-flow probe doppler unit. INTERVENTIONS Mongrel dogs (20) were instrumented for hemodynamic monitoring. The esophageal doppler probe {{was placed in the}} distal esophagus of each animal. Electromechanical dissociation (EMD) was induced by <b>clamping</b> the endotracheal <b>tube.</b> MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A period of pseudo-EMD was defined as the time where cardiac contractility was present, measured by a micromanometer tipped thoracic aortic catheter, without concurrent femoral pulses by palpation. The pseudo-EMD period could be produced consistently in all 20 animals. The characteristic doppler flow sounds were easily heard using the esophageal device in all animals. The time from endotracheal <b>tube</b> <b>clamping</b> until loss of femoral pulses was 622 +/- 96 s; until loss of radial artery doppler signals was 616 +/- 92 s; until loss of esophageal doppler signals was 728 +/- 88 s; and until loss of aortic fluctuations by thoracic aortic catheter was 728 +/- 82 s. The times to loss of esophageal doppler sounds and loss of aortic fluctuations were not significantly different. However, they were significantly longer than the time to loss of femoral pulses (P < 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS The canine asphyxial EMD model can be used for short experimental studies of pseudo-EMD. Pseudo-EMD can be consistently and non-invasively detected with this esophageal doppler device. The device is as reliable as a micromanometer tipped aortic arch catheter in detecting pseudo-EMD. The doppler device could potentially be useful in improving recognition of near cardiac arrest in pre-hospital and emergency department settings. Further research on the utility of this device in other models of low-flow states should be performed...|$|R

40|$|Background: Morbidity and {{mortality}} after resuscitation largely {{depend on the}} recovery of brain function. Ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest (VFCA) and asphyxial cardiac arrest (ACA) {{are the two most}} prevalent causes of sudden cardiac death. Up to now, most studies have focused on VFCA. However, results from the two models have been largely variable. So, it is necessary to characterize the features of postresuscitation cerebral metabolism of both models. Methods: Forty-four Wuzhishan miniature inbred pigs were randomly divided into three groups: 18 for VFCA group, ACA group, respectively, and other 8 for sham-operated group (SHAM). VFCA was induced by programmed electric stimulation, and ACA was induced by endotracheal <b>tube</b> <b>clamping.</b> After 8 min without treatment, standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated. Following neurological deficit scores (NDS) were evaluated at 24 h after achievement of spontaneous circulation, cerebral metabolism showed as the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was measured by 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Levels of serum markers of brain injury, neuron specific enolase (NSE), and S 100 β were quantified with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Compared with VFCA group, fewer ACA animals achieved restoration of spontaneous circulation (61. 1 % vs. 94. 4 %, P < 0. 01) and survived 24 -h after resuscitation (38. 9 % vs. 77. 8 %, P < 0. 01) with worse neurological outcome (NDS: 244. 3 ± 15. 3 vs. 168. 8 ± 9. 71, P < 0. 01). The CPR duration of ACA group was longer than that of VFCA group (8. 1 ± 1. 2 min vs. 4. 5 ± 1. 1 min, P < 0. 01). Cerebral energy metabolism showed as SUVmax in ACA was lower than in VFCA (P < 0. 05 or P < 0. 01). Higher serum biomarkers of brain damage (NSE, S 100 β) were found in ACA than VFCA after resuscitation (P < 0. 01).

40|$|Successful liver failure {{management}} using molecular adsorbents {{recirculating system}} during complicated veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation {{as a bridge}} to a left ventricular assist device placement. SHIGEKI TABATA, MD, Nicholas Cavarocchi, MD, Hitoshi Hirose, MD. Department of Surgery, Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA Introduction: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a well-established therapy for the patients with cardiogenic shock. We present a patient who developed severe complications while on ECMO. Case presentation: A 49 -year-old female presented with severe heart failure and was placed on veno-arterial ECMO for bridge to decision. While on ECMO, the patient developed massive hemoptysis after Swan-Ganz catheter manipulation. After the endotracheal <b>tube</b> was <b>clamped</b> and the patient relied on full ECMO support for 36 hours, the hemoptysis resolved. The patient also developed liver failure with peak total bilirubin of 56 mg/dl. The molecular adsorbents recirculating system (MARS) device was performed from ECMO day 9 to ECMO day 14. Liver function improved {{and the value of}} total bilirubin decreased to 9. 9 mg/dl on ECMO day 19. On ECMO day 20, the patient underwent a Heart Mate II LVAD placement and successful ECMO wean. During the course of surgical recovery, the patient had two episodes of sepsis and VAD pocket infection, which was finally controlled with antibiotic beads placement into the pocket. The patient was transferred to an acute rehabilitation facility on ECMO day 77. Discussion: Among the many possible hematologic complications, hemoptysis is often difficult to control. In our patient, the hemoptysis was not controllable by conventional treatment, thus the endotracheal <b>tube</b> was <b>clamped</b> to allow the entire airway to tamponade using the advantage of ECMO. Liver function is most important risk factors to determines patient survival. The MARS is a cell-free extracorporeal liver support device which eliminates albumin-bound substances, such as bilirubin. Using MARS, the patient recovered liver function to allow to perform LAD placement safely. While these mechanical circulatory support, control of sepsis isolating the source of infection was essential for patient survival...|$|R
40|$|This shroud {{provides}} a deep-space simulating environment for testing scaled-down models of passively cooling systems for spaceflight optics and instruments. It is used inside a liquid-nitrogen- cooled vacuum chamber, {{and it is}} cooled by liquid helium to 5 K. It has an inside geometry of approximately 1. 6 m diameter by 0. 45 m tall. The inside surfaces of its top and sidewalls have a thermal absorptivity greater than 0. 96. The bottom wall has a large central opening that is easily customized to allow a specific test item to extend through it. This enables testing of scale models of realistic passive cooling configurations that feature a very large temperature drop between the deepspace-facing cooled side and the Sun/Earth-facing warm side. This shroud has an innovative thermal closeout of the bottom wall, so that a test sample can have a hot (room temperature) side outside of the shroud, and a cold side inside the shroud. The combination of this closeout and the very black walls keeps radiated heat from the sample s warm end from entering the shroud, reflecting off the walls and heating the sample s cold end. The shroud includes 12 vertical rectangular sheet-copper side panels that are oriented in a circular pattern. Using tabs bent off from their edges, these side panels are bolted {{to each other and}} to a steel support ring on which they rest. The removable shroud top is a large copper sheet that rests on, and is bolted to, the support ring when the shroud is closed. The support ring stands on four fiberglass tube legs, which isolate it thermally from the vacuum chamber bottom. The insides of the cooper top and side panels are completely covered with 25 - mm-thick aluminum honeycomb panels. This honeycomb is painted black before it is epoxied to the copper surfaces. A spiral-shaped copper <b>tube,</b> <b>clamped</b> at many different locations to the outside of the top copper plate, serves as part of the liquid helium cooling loop. Another copper tube, plumbed in a series to the top plate s <b>tube,</b> is <b>clamped</b> to the sidewall tabs where they are bolted to the support ring. Flowing liquid helium through these tubes cools the entire shroud to 5 K. The entire shroud is wrapped loosely in a layer of double-aluminized Kapton. The support ring s inner diameter is the largest possible hole through which the test item can extend into the shroud. Twelve custom-sized trapezoidal copper sheets extend inward from the support ring to within a few millimeters of the test item. Attached to the inner edge of each of these sheets is a custom-shaped strip of Kapton, which is aluminum- coated on the warm-facing (outer) side, and has thin Dacron netting attached to its cold-facing side. This Kapton rests against the test item, but the Dacron keeps it from making significant thermal contact. The result is a non-contact, radiatively reflective thermal closeout with essentially no gap through which radiation can pass. In this way, the part of the test item outside the shroud can be heated to relatively high temperatures without any radiative heat leaking to the inside...|$|R
2500|$|A {{standard}} IV {{infusion set}} {{consists of a}} pre-filled, sterile container (glass bottle, plastic bottle or plastic bag) of fluids with an attachment that allows the fluid to flow one drop at a time, {{making it easy to}} see the flow rate (and also reducing air bubbles); a long sterile <b>tube</b> with a <b>clamp</b> to regulate or stop the flow; a connector to attach to the access device; and Y-sets to allow [...] "piggybacking" [...] of another infusion set onto the same line, e.g., adding a dose of antibiotics to a continuous fluid drip.|$|R
40|$|Experiments on {{filled and}} empty {{circular}} thin walled Aluminium AA 6063 tubes with varying L/D ratios {{have been performed}} to study load compression and energy absorbed for quasi static axial and oblique loading. Dependence of deformation characteristics and energy absorption responses have been studied. Energy absorption was measured from load-displacement graph obtained from UTM using MATLAB. <b>Tubes</b> were <b>clamped</b> {{at the lower end}} and axial and oblique loads were applied by applying a force at upper end with different angles to the centreline of column. Peak loads and absorbed energies have been compared for filled and empty tubes for same L/D ratio. Experimental results are used to determine energy absorption capacity due to plastic deformation of thin walled tube. The goal of the research was to study the interaction between the forming and crash response of Al AA 6063 in order to evaluate its potential for use in vehicle design for crashworthiness...|$|R
40|$|Nasogastric tube {{insertion}} is {{a routine}} procedure in medical care. However, misplacement {{of the tube}} can cause a variety of complications, which can be life threatening in some instances. We report a case of fatal hemorrhagic shock immediately after nasogastric tube insertion in a patient undergoing debridement by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for mediastinitis. Emergency endoscopy showed that the bleeding came from the nasogastric tube which had perforated the esophagus and possibly tore an intrathoracic large vessel. The nasogastric tube insertion was considered to have directly produced the perforation because no esophageal perforation had been found on preoperative endoscopy. Factors contributing {{to the risk of}} esophageal perforation in this case included coexisting mediastinitis, surgical manipulation, endotracheal intubation, inability to cooperate during general anesthesia, and repetitive advancement of the nasogastric <b>tube.</b> Prompt <b>clamping</b> of the nasogastric tube or delayed insertion after failed attempts might have improved the outcome. This report illustrates the complication of massive bleeding that can occur immediately after misplaced insertion of a nasogastric tube. Extraordinary care should be taken to avoid misplacement of the nasogastric tube during insertion...|$|R
