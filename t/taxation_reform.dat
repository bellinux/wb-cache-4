Szilard and his brother Béla founded their own political group, the Hungarian Association of Socialist Students, with a platform based on a scheme of Szilard's for <b>taxation</b> <b>reform.</b> He was convinced that socialism was the answer to Hungary's post-war problems, but not that of Kun's Hungarian Socialist Party, which had close ties to the Soviet Union. When Kun's government tottered, the brothers officially changed their religion from [...] "Israelite" [...] to [...] "Calvinist", but when they attempted to re-enroll in what was now the Budapest University of Technology, they were prevented from doing so by nationalist students because they were Jews.|$|E

2500|$|In 1985, Keating argued {{within the}} Cabinet for the {{introduction}} of a broad-based consumption tax, similar in nature to the goods and services tax that was later introduced by the Howard government. In the build-up to the 1984 election, Hawke had promised a policy paper on <b>taxation</b> <b>reform</b> to be discussed with all stakeholders at a tax summit. Three options– A, B and C– were presented in the Draft White Paper, with Keating and his Treasury colleagues fiercely advocating for C, which included a consumption tax of 15% on goods and services along with reductions in personal and company income tax, a fringe benefits tax and a capital gains tax. Although Keating was able to win the support of a reluctant Cabinet, Hawke believed that the opposition from the public, the ACTU, and the business community would be too great. He therefore decided to abandon any plans for a consumption tax, although the remainder of the reforms were adopted in the tax reform package. The loss of the consumption tax was seen a bitter defeat for Keating; he later joked about it at a press conference, saying, [...] "It's a bit like Ben Hur. We've crossed the line with one wheel off, but we have crossed the line." ...|$|E

40|$|In recent decades, the {{responsibility}} for the financing of compulsory education in rural China has rested with townships and villages which, with limited tax authority and uneven revenue capacity, increasingly relied on a plethora of arbitrarily imposed fees for funding. To reduce farmers‘ fiscal burdens, since 2000 the central government has installed a series of rural <b>taxation</b> <b>reforms.</b> Correspondingly, the central government shifted the administrative responsibilities of rural compulsory education to the county level in 2001, and implemented a series of policies {{to make up for the}} loss of revenues to education. Using a provincial-level dataset from 1998 to 2006, this study examines whether and how the rural <b>taxation</b> <b>reforms</b> have affected the adequacy and equality of compulsory education finance in China, and addresses related theoretical and policy implications from the perspective of intergovernmental fiscal relations...|$|R

40|$|This paper reports {{estimates}} of effective tax rates on rental property income in Australia. We consider three {{capital gains tax}} regimes - the current Australian system, that which prevailed between 1985 and 1999 and a realisation tax that attempts to mimic an accruals tax.

Our results suggest that negative gearing should be retained and capital gains <b>taxation</b> <b>reformed</b> to approximate an accruals tax.

40|$|Various {{education}} {{finance and}} <b>taxation</b> <b>reforms</b> {{in the past}} several decades have substantially changed China’s system for funding basic education, but the present system is still characterized by insufficient funding and large inequalities across localities. Using data of more than 2000 county-level units all over the country during 1998 - 2005, this study uses Theil index to spatially decompose the pattern of funding inequality in China’s basic education across four geographic and administrative levels. The analysis shows that the level of inequality remained high after the rural taxation and education finance reforms since 2000, despite the efforts to increase education-purpose fiscal transfers to local governments, and that the gaps are especially severe across provinces in the same region and across prefectures in the same province...|$|R
