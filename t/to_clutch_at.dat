500|$|Bystanders rushed {{onto the}} track and {{attempted}} to aid Davison and Jones until both {{were taken to the}} nearby Epsom Cottage Hospital. She was operated on two days later, but she never regained consciousness; while in hospital she received hate mail. She died on 8 June, from a fracture at the base of her skull. Found in Davison's effects were the two suffragette flags, the return stub of her railway ticket to London, her race card, a ticket to a suffragette dance later that day and a diary with appointments for the following week. The King and Queen Mary were present at the race and made enquiries about the health of both Jones and Davison. The King later recorded in his diary that it was [...] "a most regrettable and scandalous proceeding"; in her journal the Queen described Davison as a [...] "horrid woman". Jones suffered a concussion and other injuries; he spent the evening of the fourth in London, before returning home the following day. He could recall little of the event: [...] "She seemed <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> my horse, and I felt it strike her." [...] He recovered sufficiently to race Anmer at Ascot Racecourse two weeks later.|$|E

60|$|Several {{students}} turned <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> {{the ankles}} of Sam Rover, {{but he was}} too nimble for them, and with another leap he reached the flagpole and clutched it tightly.|$|E
60|$|If agony had {{not caused}} Mr. Pilkington <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> for support <b>at</b> {{the back of}} a chair, he would {{undoubtedly}} have wrung his hands.|$|R
60|$|The {{old woman}} looked at him, {{as though she}} had a strong impulse upon her <b>to</b> make another <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> his head and throat, but was {{restrained}} by a certain dogged mystery in his face.|$|R
50|$|When riding bareback, riders sit a {{bit more}} forward on the horse than they would in a saddle. They have to rest their legs more forward, along the crease between the barrel and the {{shoulder}} muscles {{in order to have}} a secure position without excessive gripping. As a rule, to make proper use of the rider's calf muscles, bareback riders need to keep their heels lower than their toes, riding with a flexed ankle and heel down, just as if they had stirrups. Riding with the toes down can lead <b>to</b> <b>clutching</b> <b>at</b> the horse with the lower legs or digging into the horse's sides with the heels, both often interpreted by the horse as a leg cue to go faster.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are thirsty? What's {{this on your}} coat? Look, {{there is}} a gate. I'll creep through and get help." [...] I {{scrambled}} up, endeavouring in vain <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> the reins.|$|E
6000|$|... "Twenty {{minutes of}} silence!" [...] I {{began to have}} my {{definite}} view and now in fact quite <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> it. [...] "Do you know you're telling me a story positively monstrous?" ...|$|E
60|$|The Tillicum {{had a high}} sheer forward, and {{he could}} not reach her rail, but as the tide swept him along he raised himself <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> it where it was lower abreast of the skylights.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know what}} the effect {{actually}} IS, on one,' he said, and again {{he looked down at}} her. Her eyes were dark and stricken with knowledge, looking into his. He saw her submerged, and he turned aside his face. 'But I absolutely am not the same. There's nothing left, if you understand what I mean. You seem <b>to</b> be <b>clutching</b> <b>at</b> the void--and {{at the same time you}} are void yourself. And so you don't know what to DO.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I know--I know. Who but I?' she cackled. 'We who go down <b>to</b> the burning-ghats <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> {{the hands}} of those coming up from the River of Life with full water-jars--yes, brimming water-jars. I did the boy wrong. He lent thee his strength? It is true that the old eat the young daily. Stands now we must restore him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|And there {{indeed it}} was!--a human figure, dimly {{discernible}} in the gloom--a figure that wavered {{from side to}} side as if about <b>to</b> fall, <b>clutching</b> <b>at</b> the wine-casks for support, had stepped unsteadily forward and for one moment stood revealed in the light of our remaining candles; then it surged heavily and fell prone upon the earth. In that moment we had all recognized the figure, the face and bearing of our father--dead these ten months and buried by our own hands!--our father indubitably risen and ghastly drunk! ...|$|R
60|$|Several turned <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> Sam's {{legs and}} feet, but he thrashed out wildly {{and all but}} one fell back, fearing injury. The undaunted student caught Sam by a heel and held on very much as might a bulldog.|$|E
60|$|Strange {{to say the}} indomitable {{artist had}} held on tight to his sketch-book, {{possibly}} because {{it was almost as}} dear to him as life, but more probably because of that feeling which induces a drowning man <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> a straw.|$|E
60|$|Larry's {{feelings}} {{had been}} deeply stirred at that moment, {{so that the}} union of the sudden shout, with the profundity of Bill's remark, {{had the effect of}} causing him <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> the tea-kettle with such haste that he upset it into the fire.|$|E
25|$|The French, all but {{masters of}} Spain in June, stood {{with their backs}} <b>to</b> the Pyrenees, <b>clutching</b> <b>at</b> Navarre and Catalonia. It was not known if even these two footholds could be {{maintained}} {{in the face of}} a Spanish attack. By October French strength in Spain, including garrisons, was about 75,000 soldiers. They were facing 86,000 Spanish troops with Spain's 35,000 British allies en route.|$|R
5000|$|Months of {{inaction}} passed at the front, {{the revolution}} having [...] "crippled Patriot Spain {{at the very}} moment when decisive action could have changed the whole course of the war". The French, all but masters of Spain in June, stood with their backs <b>to</b> the Pyrenees <b>clutching</b> <b>at</b> Navarre and Catalonia. By October 1808, French strength in Spainincluding garrisonswas about 75,000 soldiers. They were facing 86,000 Spanish troops with 35,000 British troops en route.|$|R
6000|$|Blue Bob {{stood on}} the very point of the pier, where the strong stone-work divided the current, and held his hooked pole ready <b>to</b> make a <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> the roof, {{whichever}} side it took. Jim Leonard saw him there, but although he had been holloing and yelling and crying all the time, now he was still. He wanted to say, [...] "O Bob, save me!" [...] {{but he could not}} make a sound.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{a feeble}} straw for the buried man <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>at,</b> {{yet it was}} strong enough to buoy up Hope in a stout heart. His courage returned, and with calm, {{resolute}} patience he set to work, uttering the fervent prayer, [...] "Help me, O God!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He rose in his place, {{and held}} the pocket-book aloft in his hand with a triumphant gesture. Cyril tried in vain <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> it. The witness turned round sharply, {{disturbed}} by this incident. [...] "What's that?" [...] the judge exclaimed, puckering his brows in disapprobation, and looking angrily towards the disturber.|$|E
60|$|Ailie {{was quiet}} in a moment. She {{felt in the}} terror of her young heart an almost irresistible desire <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> Glynn's neck; but the {{well-known}} voice reassured her, and her natural tendency to place blind, implicit confidence in others, served her in this hour of need, for she obeyed his injunctions at once.|$|E
60|$|The next batter {{resembled the}} first one, and the hit likewise, only it leaped wickedly at Doran {{and went through}} his hands {{as if they had}} been paper. The third man batted up a very high fly <b>to</b> Gillinger. He <b>clutched</b> <b>at</b> it with his huge shovel hands, but he could not hold it. The way he pounced upon the ball, dug it out of the grass, and hurled it at Hathaway, showed his anger.|$|R
40|$|With {{the purpose}} {{to measure the}} {{energetic}} allocation that one female displays during the spawning season in iteroparous species, relationship between the egg size and its enegetic value (J/g) was measured in the anemonefish, Amphiprion clarkii. Egg dry weight was equivalent to its volume of newly laod eggs, regardless to its sizes. Eggs with different sizes had nearly the same energetic value (24. 733 - 31. 721 J/g) pre unit of its dry weight. These {{results showed that the}} total egg volume of one clutch can be regarded as the energetic allocation of the female <b>to</b> the <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> the time, regardless to the number and egg sizes which differ seasonally and by female individuald...|$|R
5000|$|Giving {{the film}} two stars out of five, Don R. Lewis of Film Threat {{said that it}} has [...] "a few laughs" [...] but that it [...] "just trudges on, {{going through the motions}} of the {{original}} with no spark" [...] and that it [...] "suffers from the unbearable, crushing weight of political correctness." [...] Paula Nechak of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called the film [...] "simply another {{in a long line of}} utterly unnecessary remakes that, having nothing new <b>to</b> say, <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> crassness and dumbness," [...] while Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said that while [...] "the screenplay ... makes the most of Thornton's dry, skewed humor, ... nothing happens here that would distinguish this film from other sports movies." ...|$|R
60|$|Wally spun round. At {{the same}} time he leaped in the air. The effect of the {{combination}} of movements was to cause him to stagger across the room and, after two or three impromptu dance steps which would have interested Mrs. Peagrim, <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> the mantelpiece to save himself from falling. Jill watched him with quiet approval.|$|E
60|$|He {{could not}} but feel, however, {{that the chances}} of this latter event {{occurring}} were small indeed, for a passing ship or boat would not only be going at great speed, but would be very unlikely to see his cockle-shell in the darkness, or to hear his cry in the roaring gale. Still he grasped that hope as the drowning man is said <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> a straw.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Leonard," [...] she said, [...] "you are {{not very}} clever at hiding your feelings. When you {{came to see me}} the other day, do you imagine I {{believed}} for a single moment that you asked me to marry you simply because you cared? I think, Leonard, that it was because you were afraid, you were afraid of something coming into your life so big, so terrifying, that you were ready <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> the easiest chance of safety." ...|$|E
25|$|At the , he {{qualified}} fifteenth. Due <b>to</b> an overheating <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> the start, {{he dropped}} down to 20th position. A poor pit stop failed {{to help his}} cause and he finished in fourteenth position. It was similar at the , when Barrichello again finished in fourteenth. He qualified eleventh, narrowly missing Q3 but his anti-stall system kicked in {{at the start of}} the race. After recovering well, he later collided with Jaime Alguersuari when Alguersuari came across too late to cover his line, the damage blocking Barrichello's left brake duct.|$|R
60|$|The mere {{shock of}} the onset and his own amazement left Bob without breath for words. The boy, with arms convulsively {{clasping}} his body, was imprinting kisses on Bob's waistcoat in default of reaching his face. At last Falloner managed gently but firmly to free himself, and turned a half-appealing, half-embarrassed look upon the young lady, whose own face, however, suddenly flushed pink. To add to the confusion, the boy, in some reaction of instinct, suddenly ran back <b>to</b> her, frantically <b>clutched</b> <b>at</b> her skirts, and tried to bury his head in their folds.|$|R
25|$|In DCTs {{where the}} two {{clutches}} are arranged concentrically, the larger outer clutch drives the odd-numbered gears and the smaller inner clutch drives the even-numbered gears. Shifts can be accomplished without interrupting torque distribution to the driven roadwheels, by applying the engine's torque <b>to</b> one <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> {{the same time as}} it is being disconnected from the other clutch. Since alternate gear ratios can preselect an odd gear on one gear shaft while the vehicle is being driven in an even gear (and vice versa), DCTs are the fastest-shifting road car transmission available and are even able to shift faster than a professional racing driver using a manual transmission. DCTs can even shift more quickly than cars equipped with single-clutch automated-manual transmissions (AMTs), also called single-clutch semiautomatics. Also, with a DCT, shifts can be made more smoothly than with a single-clutch AMT, making a DCT more suitable for conventional road cars.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't apologize. It still serves our turn; I don't {{know that}} {{anything}} else serves it yet. And {{you make me}} think of what dear old M.D. C----told me shortly after his wife died. He had wished, when they both owned that the end was near, to suggest some comfort {{in the hope of}} another life, <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> that straw to save his drowning soul; but she stopped him. She said, 'There is nothing but duty, the duty we have wished to do and tried to do.'" ...|$|E
60|$|It was a marvellous {{experience}} {{to see her}} transformed, by the mere putting aside of her cloak, from the sweet-faced, thoughtful girl to the stern, accusing, dark, and tense woman of the play. Her voice took on the quivering intonation of the seeress, and her spread hand seemed <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> the hearts of her perfidious friends. At such moments Douglass sat entranced, afraid to breathe for fear of breaking the spell, and when she dropped her rôle and resumed her cloak he shivered with pain.|$|E
60|$|Still, his {{position}} was unsatisfactory, for, {{in addition to}} the fact that his credit as a genuine angekok had been sadly shaken because of Ippegoo's failure, he was well aware that the combat which had been interrupted was only postponed. What was {{to be done in the}} circumstances became, therefore, the urgent question of the hour. In great perplexity he sought out his poor victim Ippegoo--with something of the feeling, no doubt, that induces a drowning man <b>to</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> a straw--and silently walked with him to a secluded spot near the neighbouring cliffs.|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of Microcystis blooms is a worldwide concern {{that has caused}} numerous adverse effects on water quality and lake ecology. Elevated ammonia and microcystin concentrations co-occur during the degradation of Microcystis blooms and are toxic to aquatic organisms; we studied the relative and combined effects of these on the life history of the model organism Daphnia magna. Ammonia and microcystin-LR treatments were: 0, 0. 366, 0. 581 mg L− 1 and 0, 10, 30, 100 µg L− 1, respectively. Experiments followed a fully factorial design. Incubations were 14 d and recorded the following life-history traits: number of moults, time to first batch of eggs, time <b>to</b> first <b>clutch,</b> size <b>at</b> first batch of eggs, size <b>at</b> first <b>clutch,</b> number of clutches per female, number of offspring per clutch, and total offspring per female. Both ammonia and microcystin were detrimental to most life-history traits. Interactive effects of the toxins occurred for five traits: the time to first batch of eggs appearing in the brood pouch, time <b>to</b> first <b>clutch,</b> size <b>at</b> first <b>clutch,</b> number of clutches, and total offspring per female. The interactive effects of ammonia and microcystin appeared to be synergistic on some parameters (e. g., time to first eggs) and antagonistic on others (e. g., total offspring per female). In conclusion, the released toxins during the degradation of Microcystis blooms would result, according to our data, in substantially negative effect on D. magna...|$|R
5000|$|After the {{surrender}} of a French army corps at Bailén {{and the loss of}} Portugal Napoleon was convinced of the peril he faced in Spain. Deeply disturbed by news of Sintra, the Emperor remarked, [...] I see that everybody has lost their head since the infamous capitulation of Bailén. I realise that I must go there myself to get the machine working again.

50|$|The hastily {{modified}} 935 again won {{the pole}} and fastest lap at the six-hour Silverstone, but due <b>to</b> a <b>clutch</b> problem <b>at</b> the start, the Martini car could finish only tenth, with the second-placed Kremer 935 collecting valuable points for Zuffenhausen. A private BMW 3.5 CSL had beaten {{it to the}} finish by a second. Even more worrisome to Porsche {{was the fact that}} BMW Motorsport had also entered a turbo, a 3.2 CSL driven by Ronnie Peterson and Gunnar Nilsson. That new BMW had qualified only one second behind the factory 935, but two seconds ahead of the third placed Kremer 935. The powerful BMW did not last long in the race, however, due to gearbox problems.|$|R
