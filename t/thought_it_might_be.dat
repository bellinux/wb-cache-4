5|$|From Russia, with Love is {{the fifth}} novel by the English author Ian Fleming to feature his fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond. Fleming wrote the story in early 1956 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica; {{at the time he}} <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> his final Bond book. The novel was first {{published}} in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape on 8 April 1957.|$|E
25|$|Sufficient {{stocks of}} {{supplies}} {{had not been}} prepared for the army, since the King Gustaf IV Adolf <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> taken as provocation by the Russians. Furthermore, Swedish strategy relied on the outdated plans for Finland which took into account neither the advances in weaponry, mobility {{of the armed forces}} or the greatly improved road networks of Finland. Most of the fortifications in Finland had not been completed and those that were completed had mostly fallen into neglect and disrepair. Even the strongest of the Swedish fortresses, Sveaborg, still had several of its planned fortifications missing, most notably all the land side fortifications designed to protect against besieging enemy.|$|E
25|$|Darwin {{returned}} from Malvern {{at the end}} of June 1850 to a reawakening of his fears that his illness might be hereditary. His bright nine-year-old daughter Anne who had become a particular favourite and comfort to him fell sick. She was miserable for weeks on end, then became feverish. Their doctor could do nothing and <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> inherited. She had recovered to some extent by March 1851, but then she and her father were both laid low by influenza. Darwin recovered but Annie was still ill, and on 24 March he took her to Malvern, leaving her there for the best treatment he knew of, and returning to Downe where Emma had stayed as she was pregnant. With his first paper on barnacles printed and Hooker safely returned to Britain laden with specimens, things were looking up, but then on 15 April Annie suffered a serious relapse and Darwin had to rush to her side.|$|E

500|$|Jones's novel From Here to Eternity was {{a best-seller}} and {{well known for}} its {{successful}} movie adaptation. [...] Jones's manuscript was heavily censored by his publisher to remove profanity and references to gay prostitution; the unexpurgated version was not published until 2011. [...] Once it was, composer Stuart Brayson <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> adapted as a musical, and proposed the project to Tim Rice, who acquired the stage rights and wrote the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|When Du Bois became {{editor of}} The Crisis {{magazine}} in 1911, {{he joined the}} Socialist Party of America {{on the advice of}} NAACP founders Mary Ovington, William English Walling and Charles Edward Russell. However, he supported the Democrat Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 presidential campaign, a breach of the rules, and was forced to resign from the Socialist Party. Du Bois remained: [...] "convinced that socialism was an excellent way of life, but I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> reached by various methods." ...|$|E
500|$|A similar {{problem of}} {{interpretation}} has also plagued Narihira's last poem (quoted above). The fourth line, , is most normally read as [...] "(I never thought) {{that it might}} be yesterday or today", but has been occasionally interpreted by scholars to mean [...] "until yesterday I never <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> today"; others take it as simply meaning [...] "right about now". But the emotion behind the poem is nonetheless clear: Narihira, who died in his fifties, always knew he must die someday, but is nonetheless shocked that his time has come so soon.|$|E

500|$|Hillenburg went to Humboldt State University, in Arcata, California, as a marine-science major. He also minored in art, {{and claimed}} that [...] " [...] blossomed as a painter in Humboldt." [...] In 1984, he earned his bachelor's degree in natural-resource {{planning}} and interpretation, with an emphasis in marine resources. He intended to take a master's degree, but {{said it would be}} in art: [...] "Initially I think I assumed that if I went to school for art I would never have any way of making a living, so I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> smarter to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else. But by the time I got to the end of my undergrad work, I realized I should be in art." ...|$|E
500|$|Chambrin did {{not speak}} English, but summoned his English-speaking brother. Smith {{produced}} his RAF rank insignia as proof of his identity. Smith and Bill {{made their way to}} the border crossing, guided by Chambrin, who told them that his brother would meet them on the other side of the border. The only crossing was a bridge, manned by German sentries. Smith observed the checkpoint for a while, and saw that pedestrians crossing alone or in pairs were rarely challenged, while larger groups often were. He <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> possible simply to walk across, and told Bill to [...] "just look straight ahead and walk quietly on". They were not challenged, and met Chambrin's brother a few miles away. The Austrian and Frenchman joined them the next day; the Polish soldier, who had appeared to Smith to be underage, had lost his nerve on seeing the Germans and had gone back.|$|E

500|$|Uzumaki {{was written}} and {{illustrated}} by Junji Ito. Junji Ito's initial desire was to create a story about strange changes that would occur to people living in a very long, traditional Japanese terraced house. This story would have been based on Ito's personal experience living in such a house as a child. During the process of finding a way to draw such a long building, Ito was inspired by the shape of a mosquito coil and decided he could make the building long by having it spiral. Ito has noted that the spiral is a [...] "mysterious pattern" [...] and described writing Uzumaki as an attempt to learn the secrets of the spiral. Ito sought inspiration by methods such as staring at spirals, researching spirals, creating spiral patterns by draining water from bath tubs, eating foods with spiral patterns, and raising snails. Looking back on the series in 2006, Ito stated that while he was still uncertain what the spiral stood for, he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> representative of infinity.|$|E
500|$|Caine {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about both the production and the final version. He thinks {{that it was a}} first for him to be involved with someone his own age in a film. He compares the relationship between two middle-aged people to the romance between two teenagers. Although disappointed {{not to be able to}} collect an Academy Award because of filming in the Bahamas, he was glad to be involved in the film. In the press release, he explains that [...] "it is part of movie history... the original was one of the great all-time thrillers. I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> nice to be mixed up with that. I liked the script very much." [...] However, Caine later claimed: [...] "I have never seen it , but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific!" [...] In his 1992 autobiography What's it All About?, he says that the film [...] "will go down in my memory as the time when I won an Oscar, paid for a house and had a great holiday. Not bad for a flop movie." ...|$|E
500|$|The party now had land {{more or less}} {{continuously}} in sight. [...] The peak of Mount Haddington on James Ross Island {{remained in}} view as the party drifted slowly by. [...] They were [...] too far north for Snow Hill or Paulet Island to be accessible, and Shackleton's [...] chief hopes were now fixed on two remaining small islands at the northern extremity of Graham Land. These were Clarence Island and Elephant Island, around [...] due north of their position on 25 March. He then [...] decided that Deception Island {{might be a better}} target destination. [...] This lay far to the west, towards the [...] South Shetland Islands chain, but Shackleton <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> attainable by island-hopping. Its advantage was that it was sometimes visited by whalers, and might contain provisions, whereas Clarence Island and Elephant Island were desolate and unvisited. To reach any of these destinations would require a perilous journey in the lifeboats, once the floe upon which they were drifting finally broke up. Earlier, the lifeboats had been named after the expedition’s three chief financial sponsors: James Caird, Dudley Docker and Stancomb Wills.|$|E

500|$|McGuinn and Crosby's songs, written both {{separately}} and together, represented {{an expansion of}} the jazz influences and psychedelia that had been featured heavily on the band's previous album. [...] The song [...] "C.T.A.-102", named after the CTA-102 quasar and written by McGuinn and his science-fiction-minded friend Bob Hippard, was a whimsical, but ultimately serious song that speculated on the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life. [...] McGuinn explained the inspiration for the song in a 1973 interview with ZigZag magazine: [...] "At the time we wrote it I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> possible to make contact with quasars, but later I found out that they were stars which are imploding at a tremendous velocity. They're condensing and spinning at the same time, and the nucleus is sending out tremendous amounts of radiation, some of which is audible as an electronic impulse on a computerized radio telescope. It comes out in a rhythmic pattern ... and originally, the radio astronomers who received these impulses thought they were from a life-form in space." [...] Although the band's earlier song [...] "Mr. Spaceman" [...] had been thematically similar, [...] "C.T.A.-102" [...] was a slightly more serious attempt at tackling the subject matter, highlighted by the extensive use of studio sound effects, simulated alien voices and the sound of an electronic oscillator.|$|E
500|$|Originally a fast-medium bowler—a {{style to}} which he {{sometimes}} reverted when Surrey were short of bowlers—Fender's main bowling style was wrist spin, and he could spin the ball effectively. He gripped the ball differently from most wrist spinners, using his thumb and first two fingers, and would attempt any kind of unorthodox delivery if he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> effective. To deceive the batsman he varied [...] the position from which he bowled and {{the height of his}} arm, and occasionally bowled deliberate full tosses or long hops to surprise them. Fender hoped that, in his eagerness to score from an apparently innocuous ball, the batsman would mis-hit, a tactic he would often try when the batsman was playing defensively. Fender's love of experimentation and his surprise variations made him difficult for batsmen to face, but produced inconsistent results and he sometimes conceded many runs. His Wisden obituary suggests that Fender would have been better employed as a [...] "fourth or fifth bowler in a strong bowling side", but Surrey's weakness in bowling meant that he had to do far more work than was ideal for his style and approach. Despite his experimentation, critics regarded him as a reliable bowler using his primary method, and The Times described him as [...] "subtle in flight and with artful variations".|$|E
500|$|Shonda Rhimes, series' creator, {{says that}} the {{character}} was envisioned [...] "an old-fashioned tortured hero" [...] and likens him to Heathcliff. Originally set to appear in a multi-episode story arc, Kevin McKidd's contract was extended, securing him a slot as a series' regular of Grey's Anatomy. In July 2008, Entertainment Weekly announced the possibility of McKidd becoming a series' regular, with this possibility eventually being confirmed by People. When asked of how he got involved with the show, McKidd offered the insight: [...] McKidd told BuddyTV, [...] "It's been really great. I was nervous when I started because every job I've ever done before this, I {{have been in the}} job right from day one when everybody's new and getting to know each other. So I was nervous because I had never done this before. And I feel really grateful to the Grey's cast and crew and everyone there, really, because they've been so nice to me and gracious and accepting of me joining the show. The transition was much easier than I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> which I'm very grateful for." [...] McKidd has told People that he thinks Grey's Anatomy is a great show and he feels lucky to be on it. Shonda Rhimes, the series' creator, said of his addition, [...] "I am excited to have Kevin McKidd joining us for the season, he's been a delight to collaborate with and brings incredible passion, talent and creativity to his work. Plus, he’s already got the ‘Mc’ built into his name so we had to keep him." ...|$|E

500|$|This {{episode was}} {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} crossover episode with the CBS show Picket Fences, which was set in another town in Wisconsin. David E. Kelley, the series creator of Picket Fences, and Chris Carter, the series creator of The X-Files, were talking in a parking lot and <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> interesting to have Mulder and Scully visit Rome, Wisconsin for an X-Files episode. Unlike a traditional crossover, the two shows would be shot with different viewpoints and one would be aired as an X-Files episode and the other as an episode of Picket Fences. Ultimately, CBS decided against the crossover and both episodes created ended up becoming stand-alones. Executive producer Robert Goodwin said of the experience [...] "I spent days on the phone with a producer of Picket Fences. We spent days organizing our schedules. Then at the very last minute, of course, we found out that no one had told CBS, and they said 'Forget it. We're having enough trouble on Friday nights without publicizing The X-Files.' It's too bad." [...] The Picket Fences episode intended {{to be part of the}} crossover was called [...] "Away in the Manger" [...] and aired the week following [...] "Red Museum." [...] While every reference to Picket Fences has been purged from the X-Files episode, there still are some small winks left in the Picket Fences episode referring to the happenings at the X-Files, including a mention of Dr. Larson. Ladner, British Columbia served as a location for Delta Glen, while the beef processing plant was shot in a facility in Cloverdale, with the local employees being used for the butchering and cleaning up scenes.|$|E
500|$|On 18 May 2012 Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy {{confirmed}} that Bright would be reprising her role {{and returning to}} EastEnders. On her return, Bright {{said that it was}} [...] "really exciting to be asked back", saying that it was [...] "nice to just slot back in", adding, [...] "I feel really lucky". Talking to Inside Soap's Allison Jones and Laura-Jayne Tyler, Bright said of her return, [...] "The door was always left open for Poppy, but it was a big surprise to be asked back so quickly. I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> further down the track, so when my agent rang, I was like, 'Yes— no problem!'". Bright stated that [...] "fear crept over" [...] when she was filming her first scene since her departure, as it was without Babbington. She added that she felt [...] "safe working with Kylie", but felt that without her the audience might get to know Poppy better. In Poppy's return storyline on 12 June, she arrived back in Walford to help Tanya (Joyner) with Janine's (Brooks) wedding preparations. A spokesperson for the show claimed that Poppy had become [...] "a successful nail artist" [...] since her departure, but as Poppy's storylines progress that is revealed to be untrue; Poppy was trying to impress Tanya. Bright said in an Inside Soap interview of Poppy's storylines, [...] "I think her job in Walford is to keep things light, and right now Poppy's in a happy place. She'll carry on dipping in and out of storylines, but viewers can expect to see more of her soon. I'm excited about that!". The magazine added that Poppy had made a [...] "welcome return". Poppy begins a new friendship with Alice (Banks), who was stated to be a replacement for Jodie. Bright said of this new friendship, [...] "They are polar opposites, but that works. I think Poppy almost mothers Alice by looking after her and giving her good advice. Or at least it's what Poppy thinks is good advice!".|$|E
500|$|In April 2004, Clarkson {{entered the}} studio {{immediately}} after the Independent Tour. She said in an interview, [...] "I've written most of (the songs) so far, but there's {{some people who have}} some stuff for me. I'm not {{one of those people who}} thinks you have to write everything. (I'll sing it) as long as I can relate to it." [...] During the album's development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He revealed, [...] "I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material." [...] Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, [...] "I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone." [...] In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, [...] "I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I just really liked their vibe and I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And then I found out that he kind of split and that's what he's doing... so it worked out perfectly." [...] Moody recalled, [...] "It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, we got together and she had all these songs in mind of what she wanted to do. It's just a really, really cool process for me, because everybody is a new experience. Everybody works differently." ...|$|E
