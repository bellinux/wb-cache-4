5|$|In John's gospel, Jesus and {{his disciples}} go to Judea early in Jesus' {{ministry}} before John the Baptist was imprisoned and executed by Herod. He leads a ministry of baptism larger than John's own. <b>The</b> <b>Jesus</b> Seminar rated this account as black, containing no historically accurate information. According to the biblical historians at <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> Seminar, John likely had a larger {{presence in the}} public mind than Jesus.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Enlightenment, {{the gospels}} were usually {{regarded}} as accurate historical accounts, {{but since then}} scholars have emerged who question {{the reliability of the}} gospels and draw a distinction between <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> described in the gospels and <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> of history. Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during the quest that applied them. While there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence of Jesus, and a basic consensus on the general outline of his life, the portraits of Jesus constructed by various scholars often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.|$|E

5|$|After {{complaints}} from the dispossessed parishioners of St Faith's, {{the east end}} of the west crypt was allotted to them as their parish church. The congregation were also allowed to keep a detached tower with a peal of bells east of the church which had historically been used to peal the summons to the Cheapside Folkmote. The parish later moved to <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> chapel during the reign of Edward VI and was merged with St Augustine Watling Street after the 1666 fire.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, {{the monastic}} traditions of both Western and Eastern Christianity moved beyond vocal prayer to Christian meditation. These progressions {{resulted}} in two distinct and different meditative practices: Lectio Divina in the West and hesychasm in the East. Hesychasm involves {{the repetition of}} <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> Prayer, but Lectio Divina uses different Scripture passages at different times and although a passage may be repeated a few times, Lectio Divina is not repetitive in nature.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Nine Inch Nails {{began the}} Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series, {{in which they}} toured North America as an opening act for {{alternative}} rock artists such as Peter Murphy and <b>The</b> <b>Jesus</b> and Mary Chain. Reznor began smashing his equipment while on stage; Rockbeat interviewer Mike Gitter attributed the live band's early success in front of rock oriented audiences to this aggressive attitude. Nine Inch Nails then embarked on a world tour that continued through the first Lollapalooza festival in 1991.|$|E
5000|$|The Christian countercult {{movement}} {{asserts that}} Christian sects whose beliefs are partially or wholly not {{in accordance with}} the Bible are erroneous. It also states that a religious sect can be considered a [...] "cult" [...] if its beliefs involve a denial of what they view as any of the essential Christian teachings such as salvation, <b>the</b> Trinity, <b>Jesus</b> himself as a person, <b>the</b> ministry of <b>Jesus,</b> <b>the</b> Miracles of <b>Jesus,</b> <b>the</b> Crucifixion of <b>Jesus,</b> <b>the</b> Death of Christ, the Resurrection of Christ, the Second Coming of Christ, and the Rapture.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the work of Jon Sobrino, one of the better known Liberation theologians alive today. Sobrino is {{especially}} well known for his writings on Christology. The starting point for Sobrino's Christology is <b>the</b> historical <b>Jesus.</b> Intent on presenting a Jesus who can relate to the poor and oppressed today, Sobrino has emphasized certain key characteristics and features of <b>the</b> life of <b>Jesus</b> that best exemplify a liberation perspective. He contends, for example, that <b>the</b> historical <b>Jesus</b> experienced conflict and opposition in Galilee and was forced to re-evaluate his mission and ministry. Through this crisis, Sobrino says, <b>the</b> historical <b>Jesus</b> exemplified a faith lived out amidst conflict. For those in Latin America, the faith of <b>the</b> historical <b>Jesus</b> therefore becomes <b>the</b> archetypical model of faith in action. As Sobrino's Christology is based on <b>the</b> historical <b>Jesus,</b> it is illuminating to evaluate Sobrino's work from the perspective of western biblical scholarship, which has been concerned with the quest of <b>the</b> historical <b>Jesus</b> for over two hundred years. This thesis explores how <b>the</b> historical <b>Jesus</b> functions in Sobrino's Christology and evaluates whether Sobrino is successful in avoiding the failures of previous quests of <b>the</b> historical <b>Jesus...</b>|$|R

5|$|One catechesis of Symeon's, On Faith, {{along with}} a {{composite}} work titled One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts, {{are included in the}} Philokalia, a collection of texts by early Christian mystics. Another text in the Philokalia, titled The Three Methods of Prayer is also attributed to Symeon—it describes a method of practicing <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> Prayer that includes direction on correct posture and breathing while reciting the prayer. It is extremely unlikely that he wrote that text—some scholars attribute it to Nikiphoros the Monk, while others believe it was written by disciples of Symeon.|$|E
5|$|That year, Jenner {{encountered}} {{a group of}} men from the Glanton Exclusive Brethren who were engaging in open-air preaching, and he converted to Christianity. For 28 years, from his initial conversion until his debility from Parkinson's disease, Jenner engaged in personal evangelism, probably speaking with more than 100,000 people in total. One person who became a Christian after encountering Jenner's question was Noel Stanton, who went on to found <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> Army in 1969.|$|E
5|$|According to the author, {{he began}} {{writing the book}} {{in the same way}} he began most of his books: by {{exploring}} a question that was unresolved for him. In this case, the question became the book's title. In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey answers this question by writing that God gives grace to people unconditionally, without their need to earn it. His book includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life and accounts of historical events. Similar to his other works, What's So Amazing About Grace? has a self-deprecating tone. It describes Yancey's upbringing in a judgmental church, a theme Yancey previously explored in <b>The</b> <b>Jesus</b> I Never Knew and later returned to in Reaching for the Invisible God and Soul Survivor.|$|E

5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1990, Anjali Dutt was hired to replace Moulder, who had left {{to work with the}} bands Shakespears Sister and Ride. Dutt {{assisted}} in the recording of vocals and several guitar tracks. During this period, the band recorded in various studios, often spending just a single day at a studio before deciding that it was unsuitable. In May 1990, My Bloody Valentine settled on Protocol in Holloway as their primary location, and work began in earnest on the album, as well as a second EP, Tremolo. Like Glider, Tremolo contained a song—"To Here Knows When"—that would later appear on Loveless. The band stopped recording during the summer of 1990 in order to tour in support of the release of Glider. When Moulder returned to the project in August, he was surprised by how little work had been completed. By that point Creation Records was concerned at how much the album was costing. Moulder left again in March 1991 to work for the noise pop band <b>The</b> <b>Jesus</b> and Mary Chain.|$|E
5|$|Ecstasy is {{the second}} mini album by the {{alternative}} rock band My Bloody Valentine, released on 23November 1987on Lazy Records. Released in a limited edition of 3,000copies, it was the band's final release for Lazy Records and second to feature vocalist and guitarist Bilinda Butcher, who was recruited in April 1987following the departure of original My Bloody Valentine vocalist David Conway. Ecstasy followed the noise pop and twee pop standards of My Bloody Valentine's earlier releases for the label, drawing influence from various artists including <b>The</b> <b>Jesus</b> and Mary Chain, Love and The Byrds, and the album distanced the band further from their earlier post-punk and gothic rock sound.|$|E
5|$|Much of Keable's fiction {{contained}} autobiographical elements, often centring on his {{attitudes toward}} {{and experience of}} the Christian religious establishment. As well as these fictional explorations he produced a final, non-fiction work, The Great Galilean, outlining the religious views he developed during a lifetime's uneasy relationship to Anglicanism and Catholicism. He {{came to believe that}} the historical Jesus bore little relationship to <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> of Christian tradition, and, in The Great Galilean, attempted to reconcile his ambivalence about the orthodoxies of the Church with his enduring belief in an all-loving God. Keable's views earned him many unfavourable reviews and the contempt of the church in which he had practised, but foreshadowed ideas of free love that became prominent later in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the people}} to whom Jenner posed his {{question}} was Noel Stanton, a man from Bedfordshire, England, who was serving in Sydney with the Royal Navy at the time. Stanton became preoccupied with the memory of this meeting for several months afterwards and, the next year, became a committed Christian. Stanton went on to found <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> Army in Northampton, England, in 1969. In 1945, Jenner approached Norrie Jeffs, who had just returned from participating in Operation Meridian at Palembang on Sumatra, and, having asked Jeffs his question, Jeffs responded that he was already a Christian. Jenner then invited Jeffs over to his house, where Jeffs met several other visitors, including the woman who would later become his wife. In 1952, another person Jenner accosted with his question on George Street was Ian Boyden, a man from Roseville who was serving in the Royal Australian Air Force. After having a brief conversation with Jenner, Boyden accepted Jenner's invitation to attend a church service at Renwick Gospel Hall, where he responded to the sermon by committing to living as a Christian thenceforward, which he did for at least fifty years. Many other people who had a brief encounter with Jenner on the street in Sydney also became Christians, but Jenner did not realise that any {{of the people}} he accosted had remained a Christian beyond their initial profession of faith until 1953, when Francis Dixon told him the stories of several such people.|$|E
5|$|When {{the college}} {{was founded in}} 1571, the first charter {{installed}} David Lewis as Principal and named eight others as the first Fellows of the college. The statutes of 1622 allowed for 16 Fellows. There is now no limit {{on the number of}} Fellowships that the Governing Body can create. The college statutes provide for various categories of Fellows. Professorial Fellows are those Professors and Readers of the University who are allocated to the college by the University. One of these professorships is <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> Professor of Celtic, which is the only chair in Celtic Studies at an English university. Celtic scholars such as Sir John Rhys and Ellis Evans have held the position since its creation in 1877. The chair is currently vacant, having been held by Thomas Charles-Edwards until his retirement in 2011. The zoologists Charles Godfray and Paul Harvey are both Professorial Fellows. Official Fellows are those who hold tutorial or administrative appointments in the college. Past Official Fellows include the composer and musicologist John Caldwell, the historians Sir Goronwy Edwards and Niall Ferguson, the philosopher Galen Strawson and the political philosopher John Gray. There are also Senior and Junior Research Fellows. Principals and Fellows who retire can be elected as Emeritus Fellows.|$|E
25|$|The {{beliefs of}} <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> Fellowship {{are in line}} with {{historic}} Christian orthodoxy. Nevertheless, there are various aspects of <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> Fellowship’s way of practising Christianity that are distinctive when compared with more conventional churches.|$|E
50|$|This myth can be {{connected}} with <b>the</b> historic <b>Jesus</b> of Nazareth by further relating that Christ, having been united to the Sophia, descends into <b>the</b> earthly <b>Jesus,</b> <b>the</b> son of Mary, at his baptism, and becomes the Saviour of men.|$|R
5000|$|The {{quest for}} <b>the</b> {{historical}} <b>Jesus</b> began with <b>the</b> work of Hermann Samuel Reimarus in the 18th century. [...] Two books, both called <b>The</b> Life of <b>Jesus</b> {{were written by}} David Strauss, published in German in 1835-36, and Ernest Renan, published in French in 1863. <b>The</b> Historical <b>Jesus</b> is conceptually different than the Christ of Faith. The former is physical, while the latter metaphysical. <b>The</b> Historical <b>Jesus</b> is based on historical evidence. Every time a new scroll is unearthed or new Gospel fragment is found, <b>the</b> Historical <b>Jesus</b> is modified. And because so much has been lost, we can never know him completely.|$|R
60|$|But {{during the}} Middle Ages, {{struggling}} within this pagan, original transport, {{the transport of}} the Ego, was a small dissatisfaction, a small contrary desire. Amid the pomp of kings and popes was <b>the</b> Child <b>Jesus</b> and <b>the</b> Madonna. <b>Jesus</b> <b>the</b> King gradually dwindled down. There was <b>Jesus</b> <b>the</b> Child, helpless, {{at the mercy of}} all the world. And there was Jesus crucified.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the entry}} of <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> Army into the charismatic mainstream, the church still {{attracted}} a range of views and anti-cult groups like the Cult Information Centre, FAIR and Reachout Trust still included <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> Army on their lists.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Jesus</b> Army is the {{identity}} that <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> Fellowship Church uses in its outreach and street-based work. It is a neocharismatic evangelical Christian movement {{based in the}} United Kingdom, {{that is part of}} the British New Church Movement.|$|E
