2500|$|Shevchenko <b>was</b> arrested along <b>with</b> {{other members}} of the society on April 5, 1847. Tsar Nicholas read Shevchenko's poem, [...] "Dream". Vissarion Belinsky wrote in his memoirs that, Nicholas I, knowing Ukrainian very well, laughed and chuckled whilst reading the section about himself, but his mood quickly turned to bitter hatred when he read about his wife. Shevchenko had mocked her frumpy {{appearance}} and facial tics, which she had developed fearing the Decembrist Uprising and its plans to kill her family. After reading this section the Tsar indignantly stated [...] "I suppose he had reasons not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on terms <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> but what has she done to deserve this?" [...] In the official report of Orlov Shevchenko was accused in using [...] "Little-Russian language" [...] (archaic Russian name for Ukrainian language) of outrageous content instead of being grateful <b>to</b> <b>be</b> redeemed out of serfdom. In the report Orlov claimed that Shevchenko was expressing a cry over alleged enslavement and disaster of Ukraine, glorified the Hetman Administration (Cossack Hetmanate) and Cossack liberties and [...] "with incredible audacity poured slander and bile on persons of Imperial House".|$|R

40|$|Failure to {{acknowledge}} responsibility and <b>to</b> act forthrightly <b>is</b> a temptation <b>to</b> which people <b>are</b> very susceptible. In the biblical account, {{it is noteworthy}} that Adam and Eve’s expulsion from Eden begins with this human tendency to evade responsibility or to deflect it onto someone else. When God asks Adam if he has eaten from the forbidden tree, he replies: “The woman that You gave <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> me—she gave <b>me</b> of the tree and I ate. ” Eve responds no differently, replying to God’s query regarding what she has done: “The serpent deceived me, and I ate” (Genesis 3 : 11 – 13). The Lord does not take kindly to this, and the disappointing persons are expelled as well as punished. Still, the decision to expel from the unique garden its denizens without simultaneously demanding of them a process of internal character change neglects something critical. One may well ask if this is not also the prototypical case of moving problematic people from parish to parish. When Adam and Eve set out for their next home, they do so without the biblical text documenting repentance, acceptance of responsibility, or any other form of behavioral or moral evolution. The text indicates that they were punished, and tha...|$|R
40|$|Objective: {{to explore}} women's {{experiences}} of labour and birth {{in the context}} of a termination of pregnancy for fetal abnormality in the second trimester of pregnancy. Design: meta-synthesis of 10 qualitative studies which included the experiences of 581 women. Data analysis was informed by van Manen's four lifeworld existentials (lived body, lived space, lived time and lived human relationships) and focused only on women's experiences of their labour and birth when terminating a pregnancy in the second trimester for fetal abnormality. Key findings: eight themes were generated by the analysis. In my head: a storm of emotion reflected the lived or felt space. In this space women make meaning of the experience. Too late to turn back time and Living and escaping the moment considered lived time; it is lived time that enables a woman to reinterpret who they once were and who they are becoming. The existential concept of lived body represented the women's physical or bodily presence and was reflected in the themes; The language of labour: un-describable torture, The meaning of pain; punishment and protection and Being a mother in the space where birth meets death. Relational or the lived human relationship is reflected in See me… talk <b>to</b> me…hear me… <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and Sorry baby. These themes describe the women's lived sense of others in the interpersonal space that they share with them. Key conclusions: the findings of this meta-synthesis provide insight into how emotionally and physically traumatic a woman's labour and birth experiences can be in this context. Women wanted to spend time with their baby constructing lasting memories that they could hold onto and share. They needed acknowledgment that their baby existed and their loss was tangible and real. What happened within the space of the relationship women shared <b>with</b> care providers <b>was</b> seen as vital, especially when respectful and dignified interaction was experienced. The women's need for human contact and support through their experience was also seen as critical. Implications for practice: the need for greater understanding and acknowledgement of the woman's experience by all caregivers is required. Woman-centred and situation sensitive care provision should be prioritised. Further research that acknowledges and prioritises the feminine voice and the lived experience of women is required.

50|$|During {{the middle}} of the 1990s, Dover {{released}} his first album, Sister, practically with no commercial success. It was not until his second album released in 1997, Devil Came to Me, when the band became famous. The album came to sell {{more than half a million}} copies worldwide, and the critics considered Dover the best group in the Spanish independent music scene. In 1999 they released their third album Late at Night, getting a triple platinum in February 2000. I Was Dead for 7 Weeks in the City of Angels is their fourth album, published in 2001, which achieved the number 1 on the Spanish sales list, selling over 125,000 discs in just over a week. A year later, in July 2002, they released their first EP, It's Good <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Me!,</b> <b>with</b> a total of eight songs, five live, two acoustic and one unreleased song: Mystic Love, which was single of this album. In 2003 they published the album The Flame, recorded entirely in Spain with the American producer Rick Will. This album sold about 50,000 copies in Spain and as many in Germany. In November 2005, Dover published in Japan its first compilation album titled Oh! Mother Russia, which contained the greatest hits from the last three studio albums. One year later, Dover gives a new, different and radical turn in his career with its album Follow the City Lights, published in 2006 with an imaginative blend of rock-electronic-dance-pop genres. In November 2007, Dover publishes a double compilation album titled 2, which contains the greatest hits in its electro pop version, plus a new song called Soldier. Its seventh studio album I Ka Kené would not be released until 2010, consisting of 10 songs sung in English, Bambara and French. This album was a commercial failure, selling just 5,000 copies. After a record five-year break, in 2015, the band from Madrid published a new album, Complications, leaving aside the electronic sound to return to their rocker roots. To date, Dover has sold nearly 2 million copies worldwide.|$|R
