5|$|Most {{forms of}} {{camouflage}} are made ineffective by movement: a deer or grasshopper may be highly cryptic when motionless, but instantly seen when it moves. But one method, motion dazzle, requires rapidly moving bold patterns of contrasting stripes. Motion dazzle may degrade predators' ability {{to estimate the}} prey's speed and direction accurately, giving the prey an improved chance of escape. Motion dazzle distorts speed perception and is most effective at high speeds; stripes can also distort perception of size (and so, perceived range to the target). As of 2011, motion dazzle had been proposed for military vehicles, but never applied. Since motion dazzle patterns would make animals more difficult to locate accurately when moving, but easier <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>when</b> stationary, {{there would be an}} evolutionary trade-off between motion dazzle and crypsis.|$|E
25|$|On {{top of the}} slug, {{behind the}} head, is the saddle-shaped mantle, and under this are the genital opening and anus. On one side (almost always the right hand side) of the mantle is a {{respiratory}} opening, which is easy <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>when</b> open, but difficult <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>when</b> closed. This opening {{is known as the}} pneumostome.|$|E
25|$|Slightly Included {{category}} (SI) diamonds have noticeable inclusions {{that are}} easy to very easy for a trained grader <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>when</b> viewed under 10x magnification. The SI category is divided into two grades; SI1 denotes a higher clarity grade than SI2. These {{may or may not be}} noticeable to the naked eye.|$|E

25|$|In testing, it {{was found}} that the faint range-only signal became hard <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>when</b> the signal was noisy and jumping about. A final change added a slight fixed delay to the range-only signal, causing its trace to shift to the right. Now three {{distinct}} blips appeared on the elevation display, the range blip on the right, and the two elevation signals aligned vertically just to the left.|$|E

25|$|Very Slightly Included {{category}} (VS) diamonds have minor inclusions {{that are}} difficult to somewhat easy for a trained grader <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>when</b> viewed under 10x magnification. The VS category is divided into two grades; VS1 denotes a higher clarity grade than VS2. Typically the inclusions in VS diamonds are invisible without magnification; however, infrequently some VS2 inclusions may still be visible. An example would be on a large emerald cut diamond which has a small inclusion under the corner of the table.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the edges}} of south eastern towns, {{perfectly}} good agricultural land often remains uncultivated {{as a result of}} price distortions created by the Metropolitan Green Belt. Indeed, since around 2001 speculators have been buying Green Belt agricultural land, generally adjacent to built up areas, and selling it off in plots, persuading buyers that the government will have to weaken Green Belt protection to solve the housing crisis (see below). It is hard <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>when</b> such plots could come back into production.|$|E
25|$|The {{work on the}} pediments {{lasted from}} 438 to 432BC, and the sculptures of the Parthenon pediments {{are some of the}} finest {{examples}} of classical Greek art. The figures are sculpted in natural movement with bodies full of vital energy that bursts through their flesh, as the flesh in turn bursts through their thin clothing. The thin chitons reveal the body underneath as the focus of the composition. The distinction between gods and humans is blurred in the conceptual interplay between the idealism and naturalism bestowed on the stone by the sculptors. Every statue in the west pediment has a fully completed back, which would have been impossible <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>when</b> the sculpture was on the temple; this indicates that the sculptors put great effort into accurately portraying the human body.|$|E

Mandy finds a picture of him as a baby, and puts it on the mirror for him <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> <b>When</b> Fergus comes back through the mirror it transforms him into the baby version of himself in the photograph. The children do {{not know what to do}} and send him back through where he is found by Violette. Constance tells the other that her mother found him and they try to get him back. They realise they must find a more recent picture of Fergus. They decide to use the picture which had been taken that morning. They return through the mirror and Fergus is restored to his teenage self, unaware of what had happened.|$|E

500|$|Although Avatar is not {{considered}} anime because of its American origin, Tasha Robinson of the SciFi Channel observed that [...] "Avatar blurs the line between anime and [...] domestic cartoons until it becomes irrelevant." [...] An IGN reviewer commented that Sozin's Comet [...] "had that classic anime-look that I've always loved <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>when</b> watching old anime movies. The story through the animation was perfectly done." [...] The special's music was written and composed by [...] "The Track Team", led by Jeremy Zuckerman. However, unlike past episodes, a music track produced by a live orchestra was used, rather than one in MIDI format.|$|E

500|$|Christopher Reeve, {{star of the}} Superman films, {{expressed}} his approval of the show:I {{was a little bit}} skeptical when I heard about [...] at first, but I must say the writing, the acting, and the special effects are quite remarkable. In 1977, a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film—it's pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly TV show. It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than I thought I was going <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>when</b> I first heard about the series. I think the show is doing a really good job following the mythology, and Tom {{is doing a good job}} following the tradition.|$|E
500|$|In October 2014, Kreisberg {{described}} the episodes as {{very important to}} both Barry and Oliver {{and what they are}} going thorough, while also promising [...] "one of the biggest surprises for Arrow of all time in The Flash episode". Guggenheim added, [...] "It's like the bomb underneath the table, and I think part of the fun is waiting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>when</b> Oliver is going to learn what the audience learns on Flash." [...] It was later announced that another secret would be revealed in the final moments of The Flash episode that will help [...] "introduce the next phase of The Flash in a big way". In the episode, Oliver runs into an ex-girlfriend, last seen pregnant with his child in season two of Arrow and had been told by Oliver's mother Moira to tell him that she'd lost the baby and disappear. It is revealed to the viewers that she has a child and it's presumed to be Oliver's. After the airing of the episode, Guggenheim confirmed that indeed it was Oliver's child. At the end of the episode, Robbie Amell, who played Ronnie Raymond—Caitlin's former fiancée presumed dead after the particle accelerator explosion—appears as Firestorm using his powers.|$|E

500|$|Crace {{was pleased}} with public {{reaction}} to the mother-daughter storyline, commenting prior to the reveal: [...] "Everyone seems desperate to know why Danielle hasn't told Ronnie yet, so I'm taking that as a sign they're enjoying the story. Viewers are always telling me that they love it when Danielle and Ronnie have a scene together – I think they're {{on the edge of}} their seats, waiting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>when</b> Danielle is finally going to admit the truth about her identity." [...] Danielle's death received a mixed reaction from viewers, with 90% of viewers polled by The Sun opining that killing Danielle off was a mistake. The decision was defended by Santer, who stated: [...] "We acknowledge that we didn't deliver the happy ending that many of the audience may have been hoping for, and that for some people this was upsetting. We hope viewers understand that our aim is to deliver the best drama. That doesn't always lead to a happy ending. EastEnders – like all good drama – contains a balance of storylines, both happy and sad. We’re proud of the episode, the storyline which built up to it and the way the audience have engaged with it." [...] Following Danielle's final episode, regulator Ofcom confirmed they had received a number of complaints from the public about the [...] "violent nature of the show and the horrific death at the end", and the fact it was broadcast before the 9p.m. watershed.|$|E
