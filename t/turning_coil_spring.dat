40|$|Introduction: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the percentage of force degradation of elastomeric chains, NiTi closed <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> and stainless steel closed <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> at different time intervals in different media. Materials and methods: Three types of space closing auxiliaries, such as elastomeric chains, NiTi closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> and stainless steel <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> immersed in artificial saliva, alcohol-free mouthrinse (Colgate plax) and alcohol-containing mouthrinse (Listerine) at time interval of 1, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days were divided into nine groups of 15 each: Group I- 15 polyurethane elastomeric chain immersed inside artificial saliva (Control). Group II- 15 polyurethane elastomeric chain immersed inside alcohol-free mouthrinse. Group III- 15 polyurethane elastomeric chain immersed inside alcohol-containing mouthrinse. Group IV- 15 stainless steel closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> immersed inside artificial saliva (Control). Group V- 15 stainless steel closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> immersed inside alcohol-free mouthrinse. Group VI- 15 stainless steel closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> immersed inside alcohol-containing mouthrinse. Group VII- 15 NiTi closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> immersed inside artificial saliva (Control). Group VIII- 15 nickel titanium closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> immersed inside alcohol-free mouthrinse. Group IX- 15 NiTi closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> immersed inside alcohol-containing mouthrinse. The percentage of force degradation was measured with the universal testing machine. Results: The force produced by elastomeric chain, stainless steel closed <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> and NiTi closed <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> at seven time intervals in artificial saliva, alcohol-free mouthwash and alcohol-containing mouthwash showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0. 001). Conclusion: The force degradation in alcohol-containing mouthwash solution (Listerine) is more as compared to alcohol-free mouthwash solution (Colgate plax) ...|$|R
40|$|Open <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> {{are used}} {{commonly}} to create {{space for a}} buccally or lingually/palatally blocked out a tooth. However, as space opens up the open <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> loosens most of its activation and thus requires reactivation. Various techniques {{have been developed to}} re-activate the open <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> without removing the base archwire. While reactivating the open <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> has to be compressed towards one side using wire tucker or with the tip of the finger, thus making the procedure very cumbersome for the clinician. A new simple and efficient method to overcome this problem is an open <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> retractor, which secures the compressed open <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> on one side to the adjacent bracket, thus rendering clinician to perform reactivation procedures with ease...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} {{a review of}} {{fundamental}} stress distribution, characteristic of helical <b>coil</b> <b>springs.</b> An in depth discussion on the parameters influencing the quality of <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> is also presented. Factors affecting strength of <b>coil</b> <b>spring,</b> F. E. A. approaches by the researchers for <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> analysis are also studied. Reduction in weight is a need of automobile industry. Thus the springs are to be designed for higher stresses with small dimensions. This requires critical design of <b>coil</b> <b>springs.</b> This leads to critical material and manufacturing processes. Decarburization {{that was not a}} major issue in the past now becomes essential, to have better spring design...|$|R

40|$|Several {{types of}} force {{delivering}} system {{are used to}} carry out tooth movement in orthodontics. <b>Coil</b> <b>springs</b> being one of them are used for the same thus requiring minimal operator manipulation. Aims and objectives : The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effect of wire diameter, lumen size and length of <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> on the load produced as a function of displacement of SS and NiTi <b>coil</b> <b>spring.</b> Materials and methods : The study consisted of 60 samples of open and closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> (30 each). Open <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> were tested in compression and closed <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> in tension using a Lloyd universal testing machine. The data obtained was subjected to statistical analysis using student′s t-test. Results : Mean values, standard deviation and t-value were calculated. Statistically significant difference were obtained in between the groups (p < 0. 05), (p < 0. 001). Discussion : The heaviest load value at 60 % compression was recorded in 0. 010 × 0. 030 spring with 20 cm initial length due to its large wire diameter and reduced lumen size among the <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> tested. Straight line of load deflection curve bears clinical significance due to unpredictable behavior of spring beyond a certain limit. Permanent deformation exhibited by SS <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> is due to high stiffness is low spring fact. Conclusion : Coil linear load delivered by SS open <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> on compression changes the original length from 33 to 50 % which depends on wire diameter and lumen size of <b>coil</b> <b>spring...</b>|$|R

In real applications of ceramic <b>coil</b> <b>springs,</b> knowing the effect of sintering temperature on their microstructure and strength distribution plays a crucial role. In this paper, the microstructure and strength distribution of alumina <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> sintered at 1550, 1600 and 1650 °C are investigated. Strength data of alumina <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> are fitted by a Weibull distribution and according to the coefficient of determination, the deviation from the Weibull distribution can be determined.

40|$|In Hermetic Compressors, {{one of the}} {{vibration}} transmission paths from main body to the shell is discharge tube. The main parts of discharge tube are tube part, <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> on the tube and resonator cap. The end which is mounted to main body is excitation point. The point that tube is fixed to the shell is evaluation point to investigate the transmitted vibration energy to the shell. Â The <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> on the tube has two main effects on tube. One {{of them is the}} mass effect. In usage of <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> creates additional mass to the discharge tube and it causes change of natural frequency of discharge tube. The other one is the damping effect. <b>Coil</b> <b>spring</b> on discharge tube creates impact damping effect and reduces kinetic energy of vibrating discharge tube. The <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> parameters such as spring length, location, diameter, clearance distance, and spring constant which are effects vibration and acoustics characteristics of compressor therefore these parameters should be determined carefully. In this paper, effects of <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> and <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> parameters on vibration and acoustic characteristics of compressor are studied numerically and experimentally.

40|$|Open <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> are {{commonly}} used in orthodontic practice to create space for a palatally or lingually blocked out tooth.

In such situations, the clinician needs to remove the arch wire and reinserts a longer <b>coil</b> <b>spring.</b> A new simple and cost-effective technique describes an intraoral reactivation of an open <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> without the need for removal of the base archwire with the additional benefit of preventing unwanted forces to the adjacent teeth...|$|R

40|$|<b>Coil</b> <b>springs</b> are {{a common}} element in {{compliant}} actuators. For closed-loop control, {{the force of the}} <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> has to be measured. Typically, deflection sensors indirectly measure this force. Implicitly, this assumes that the <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> is a pure stiffness, without any mass. In reality, internal oscillations can occur due to impacts or other excitations of the spring’s resonance frequencies. This letter investigates the reliability of different force-sensing methods for <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> that are oscillating internally. In addition to standard sensing via strain gauges or deflection sensors, also a new type of sensing is included, namely force estimation via the spring’s own electrical inductance. First, a lumped-mass model is used in simulations of three realistic conditions a <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> might be subjected to in robotic applications. Second, a hardware experiment is conducted for one condition. Key effects predicted by the model are also found in the experiment, confirming the model’s validity. Results show that for all sensors, the increase in measuring uncertainty due to internal oscillations is of the same order of magnitude as typical sensors’ measuring uncertainty.
