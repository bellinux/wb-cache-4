5|$|After {{going to}} the ground, Jackson managed <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> of the choke. Jackson began to attack with ground and pound, dealing strikes to Silva's body while Silva {{answered}} with the same from the bottom. Jackson began to land punches to Silva's face, and the latter attempted a Juji-gatame, a variation of an armbar. Silva could not pull off the hold, and Jackson moved into side control shortly after. From here, Jackson threw punches to Silva's head and followed by landing two knees, again to the head (which were legal under Pride rules).|$|E
5|$|While Eddie goes in pursuit, Peter manages <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> {{and goes}} after Connors as Spider-Man. While trying to {{communicate}} with him, they end up on a subway train fighting both inside, outside, and underneath it. Finally, Spider-Man falls off the train and Connors escapes. Spider-Man returns to the lab and is given a gene cleanser from Martha which must be administered to Connors orally. He then goes off to Bronx Zoo, where Connors is reportedly at.|$|E
5|$|Spider-Man {{tries to}} catch up with him and notices him sneaking into his friend Harry's apartment. Sneaking in, he spots Harry's father Norman coming out of a secret {{passageway}} and theorizes that Norman is the Goblin. Spider-Man is forced <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> after Harry walks in, and misses Harry drinking an experimental, drug-like formula. A short while later, Peter Parker calls Harry and invites him to a Bleecker Street Halloween carnival along with Gwen, Mary Jane and Liz. Harry accepts the invitation. On his way to the carnival, Peter attempts to sell some Spider-Man photographs to Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson, but he refuses and tells him to try selling them to the Globe.|$|E

5|$|Hoping {{to obscure}} the truth about Stanley's affair, Michael starts {{spreading}} a variety of false rumors, among them that there is another person physically inside Kevin (Brian Baumgartner), that Kelly is anorexic, that Toby (Paul Lieberstein) is still a virgin, that Pam (Jenna Fischer) is pregnant, and that Andy (Ed Helms) is gay. When Andy hears about this, he realizes that many people have thought this {{about him in the}} past and gets increasingly insecure as he begins to question his sexual orientation. Jim and Pam, who were trying to keep Pam's pregnancy a secret, think they have been found out. The couple then notice that there have been various absurd rumors about office employees being spread. When Jim brings it to everyone's attention, they trace one particular rumor back to Michael, who then tries <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> of the office.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{that they}} need one big show to raise the {{necessary}} money, the brothers persuade their old agent to book the Palace Hotel Ballroom, north of Chicago. They mount a loudspeaker atop the Bluesmobile and drive the Chicago area promoting the concert—and alerting the police, the Nazis, and the Good Ol' Boys of their whereabouts. The ballroom is packed with blues fans, police officers, and the Good Ol' Boys. Jake and Elwood perform two songs, then sneak offstage, as the tax deadline is rapidly approaching. A record company executive offers them a $10,000 cash advance on a recording contract—more than enough {{to pay off the}} orphanage's taxes and Ray's IOU—and then shows the brothers how <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> of the building unnoticed. As they make their escape via a service tunnel, they are confronted by the mystery woman: Jake's vengeful ex-fiancée. After her volley of M16 rifle bullets leaves them miraculously unharmed, Jake offers a series of ridiculous excuses that she accepts, allowing the brothers to escape to the Bluesmobile.|$|E
5|$|United {{opened the}} 1969–70 {{campaign}} {{by winning the}} Charity Shield with a 2–1 win over Manchester City, {{and went on to}} face realistic possibility of winning the treble – the league, FA Cup and European Cup. However they missed out on all three trophies as the games built up {{towards the end of the}} season, and the league title was the first <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> of their hands as Everton went on to build an insurmountable lead. They then bowed out of the European Cup after a 3–1 aggregate defeat to Celtic, including a 2–1 loss at Hampden Park in front of a UEFA record crowd of 136,505. They took two replays to overcome Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-finals (Bremner scored the only goal in 300 minutes of football), but lost 2–1 in the replayed final to Chelsea after the original 2–2 draw, in which Charlton opened the scoring. Charlton took responsibility for Peter Osgood's goal in the replay as he was distracted from marking duties as he was trying to get revenge on a Chelsea player who had kicked him.|$|E

25|$|Screenwriters and {{directors}} use {{the image of}} a man or woman slipping on a pair of leather gloves to indicate knowledge that a crime is happening.

This can be seen in Batman and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.|$|E
25|$|Significant {{conclusions}} of the report include the main objective, that American foreign policy and homeland security policies must adapt to better {{stem the tide of}} U.S. citizens traveling to and from distant battlefields. The report identifies police officials from the non-federal level who have cited their own personal worries about lack of resources in the form of security clearances in order to help the federal government deal with counterterrorism. The report identifies weak spots along the chain of foreign travel where terrorists are able <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> of counterterrorism oversight capabilities. The authors of the work describe holes in law enforcement checkpoints both within the United States and more significantly in European countries were it is increasingly not difficult for terrorists to travel {{back and forth to the}} Western world.|$|E

25|$|Willot finally {{emerged from}} prison in January 1795. He regained his rank as general of brigade on 13 April. He became the acting {{commander}} of the 1st Division of the Army of the Western Pyrenees in place of Jean-Antoine Marbot. On 6 July 1795 he was promoted general of division. On 13 July, the army commander Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey sent Willot and 3,500 troops from Salvatierra toward Vitoria while another 4,500-man column under Bernard Dessein reached Vitoria from the north. The Spanish troops managed <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> of the trap but {{they were forced to}} abandon their supplies. Dessein and Willot then joined forces and occupied Bilbao. When the news of the Treaty of Basel arrived on 5 August 1795, the French occupied Miranda de Ebro. The French troops started back to Bayonne on 17 August. Two divisions numbering 10,995 soldiers were assembled under Willot and Dessein and ordered to march to join Lazare Hoche's Army of the West. By the time the reinforcement reached its destination at Fontenay-le-Comte, heavy desertion reduced its numbers to 4,000 men.|$|E
25|$|Pelléas arrives {{alone at}} the well. He is worried that he has become deeply {{involved}} with Mélisande and fears the consequences.

She was able <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> without Golaud's noticing. At first she is distant but when Pelléas tells her he is going away she becomes more affectionate. After admitting his love for her, Mélisande confesses that she has loved him since she first saw him. Pelléas hears the servants shutting the castle gates for the night. Now they are locked out, but Mélisande says that it is for the better. Pelléas is resigned to fate too. After the two kiss, Mélisande hears something moving in the shadows. It is Golaud, who has been watching the couple from behind a tree. Golaud strikes down a defenseless Pelléas with his sword and kills him. Mélisande is also wounded but she flees into the woods saying to a dying Pelléas that she does not have courage.|$|E
25|$|As in 2012, Valverde won {{the overall}} {{classification}} of the Vuelta a Andalucía in 2013, {{where he also}} won the points classification in the race. Valverde continued showing some good form after finishing with podium places in the Vuelta a Murcia, the Amstel Gold Race and in Liège–Bastogne–Liège. After having a decent spring campaign, Valverde aimed for a podium finish in the Tour de France. Valverde started the Tour in good form after finishing third in Ax3 Domaines behind Chris Froome and Richie Porte. However the next day, Porte lost over 15 minutes which moved Valverde into second overall right before the tour left the Pyrenees. On Stage 13, Valverde lost almost 10 minutes after getting a flat tire. Despite a very hard pursuit, the high crosswinds and {{the pace of the}} peloton prevented him and his teammates from catching back. They ended up with the second group at the finish causing him <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> of the top ten. Despite losing his second position, Valverde managed to do well in the Alps which moved him back into the top ten of the overall standings, finishing 8th overall.|$|E

25|$|The III Cavalry Corps {{was first}} {{constituted}} for the French invasion of Russia and {{placed under the}} command of General of Division Emmanuel Grouchy. On 24 June 1812, corps numbered 9,676 men in 50 squadrons and was supported by 30 horse artillery pieces. There were three divisions under Generals of Division Louis Pierre Aimé Chastel, Jean-Pierre Doumerc, and Armand Lebrun de La Houssaye. Chastel led the 3rd Light Cavalry Division, Doumerc directed the 3rd Heavy Cavalry Division, and Houssaye commanded the 6th Heavy Cavalry Division. The Imperial French army captured Vilnius and Emperor Napoleon entered the city on 28 June. Four days later a freak storm with freezing rain blew all night long, causing the deaths of thousands of horses. Colonel Lubin Griois of Grouchy's corps artillery claimed that the storm killed one-fourth of his horses. Soon after, Grouchy was directed to place his cavalry under Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout in attempt to cut off General Pyotr Bagration's Russian Second Army. Though Davout reached Minsk ahead of Bagration, the Russian was able <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> of the trap because King Jérôme Bonaparte failed to pursue with energy.|$|E
25|$|Carlito buys train {{tickets to}} Miami {{for himself and}} Gail, now pregnant. When he stops by his club to get the stashed money, Carlito is met {{by a group of}} mobsters led by Vinnie. The Italians plan on killing Carlito, but he manages <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> through a secret exit. The Italians pursue him {{throughout}} the city's subway system and into Grand Central Terminal, where they engage in a gunfight. Carlito kills all of his pursuers except Vinnie, who is shot and killed by police attracted by the gunfire. As Carlito runs to catch the train where Gail and Pachanga are waiting for him, he is ambushed by a disguised Benny, who shoots Carlito several times in the abdomen with a silenced gun. Pachanga admits to the dying Carlito that he is now working for Benny, only to be shot as well. Carlito hands a tearful Gail the money and tells her to escape with their unborn child and start a new life elsewhere. As he is wheeled away on a gurney, Carlito stares at a billboard with a Caribbean beach and a picture of a woman. The billboard then comes to life in his mind, and the woman, who is clearly Gail, starts dancing as Carlito slowly dies.|$|E
25|$|By nightfall on July 6, {{elements}} of the first echelon (52nd and 67th Guards Rifle Divisions) had been encircled and were forced <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> through gaps in the German lines, at considerable cost. The Germans attempted to continue their attack, but were frustrated by the stubborn resistance of the 90th Guards in the strongpoints of Zavidovka, Lukhanino, and Syrtsevo, all in the basin of the Pena, {{with the support of}} the two corps of the tank army; 6th Tank in particular inflicted significant damage on a tank group of 3rd Panzer Division in Zavidovka, forcing it to abandon the village and retreat. By the afternoon of the 9th it was becoming clear that the German forces were re-directing their offensive away from the road to Oboyan in favor of a more easterly route. 90th Guards and 10th Motorized Brigade at Lukhanino and Shepelevka were coming under more intense attacks as the Germans tried to outflank 6th Tank. By the end of July 11, XXXXVIII Panzer Corps, in intense fighting, forced the ad-hoc Group Getman (6th Tank, most of 3rd Mechanized, and 90th Guards) out of the area of the Psel River bend and partially encircled it. As the eastern re-direction continued, the reinforced 6th Guards Army was ordered to make a frontal counterattack with practically its full strength on July 12. The division, along with the rest of 22nd Guards Corps, was to make the main attack from the Chapaev - Novenkoe - Kruglik line along the Syrtsevo - Yakovlevo axis. The goal of this attack was to hold the German forces in place and prevent them from massing more strength at Prokhorovka. In the event, the attack did significant damage to the German 332nd Infantry Division, which was caught regrouping, and recaptured Chapaev, but realized few other positive results.|$|E

500|$|By 1811, the Royal Navy {{enjoyed a}} {{worldwide}} naval supremacy over the French, including the seas immediately off the French coast. To avoid being attacked {{as they left}} Brest, French ships had to attempt <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> either {{under cover of darkness}} or during storms that drove the British away from the dangerous coastline. This also however forced the French ships to fight against the wind to leave their harbours and as a result, Roquebert's ships only covered [...] in the first 18 days. On 24 February, the squadron captured a Portuguese merchant ship and discovered Lisbon newspapers aboard that announced the British invasion, although not its outcome. On 13 March, Roquebert's ships crossed the Equator and on 18 April they passed the Cape of Good Hope at distance, benefitting from good weather and a strong breeze during the latter stages of the journey. At 23:00 on 6 May, 93 days after leaving Brest, the French convoy arrived off Île de la Passe at the entrance to Grand Port.|$|E
500|$|On 7 February, Normand's unit fought its {{way into}} the city and began to bombard the Turkish {{positions}} with heavy artillery. The following day, he relieved Cornelope's column, which had held its position for two weeks, and broke through to reach General Quérette's headquarters. To Quérette's astonishment, Normand told that he had come with orders from General Dufieux to begin the full evacuation of the French garrison of Marash, followed by the Christian and loyal Muslim population. Quérette was reluctant to carry out such a command but Normand claimed that no more reinforcements or supplies would be sent. With this in mind Quérette agreed to the evacuation. The order to evacuate ironically came at precisely the same moment that the Turkish Nationalists were seeking a ceasefire: no sooner had General Quérette begun negotiations with the Turkish representative, Dr. Mustafa, when he was told by Normand to prepare to evacuate. By 3:00 in the morning of 11 February, Quérette had destroyed the remaining ammunition dumps and was preparing <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> under the cover of darkness, in order to prevent the terrified Armenian population from hindering his troops' withdrawal. They were, however, unable to do so and 4,000–5,000 Armenians managed to flee with the French troops in a three-day, [...] long march to İslahiye. Subsequently called the [...] "Marash Affair," [...] many of the Armenian refugees died from exhaustion and from the bitter cold, such that there were only 1,500 of their number when they reached İslahiye on 13 February.|$|E
