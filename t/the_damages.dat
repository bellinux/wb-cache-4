5|$|As {{attorney}} general, Crittenden issued {{only one}} notable opinion. The plaintiff {{in the case}} was an individual whose property had been damaged during Andrew Jackson's invasion of {{what would become the}} Florida Territory in 1818.

A Florida court found in favor of the plaintiff and ordered the federal government to compensate him for <b>the</b> <b>damages</b> and to pay him interest on his claim from the time <b>the</b> <b>damages</b> were incurred. Treasury Secretary Thomas Ewing asked Crittenden whether the court had the authority to award interest and whether or not it should be paid. Crittenden opined that it did not, and Ewing did not pay the interest. Crittenden's opinion was used as a precedent in similar cases by future attorneys general.|$|E
