In 1933, he was forced to resign from the Prussian Academy of Arts. Kirchner became increasingly disturbed by the situation in Germany, writing: [...] "Here we have been hearing terrible rumours about torture of the Jews, but it’s all surely untrue. I’m a little tired and sad about the situation up there. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> in the air. In the museums, the hard-won cultural achievements of the last 20 years are being destroyed, and yet the reason why we founded the Brücke was to encourage truly German art, made in Germany.

To suppose because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> between an elephant-god and a child-god somewhere in the heart of Africa, that therefore another elephant can be so influenced that it kills a child in England, is to my mind out of all reason." ...|$|E

60|$|Teutonic fiction, as a rule, is {{somewhat}} heavy and very sentimental; but Werner's Her Son, excellently translated by Miss Tyrrell, {{is really a}} capital story and would make a capital play. Old Count Steinruck has two grandsons, Raoul and Michael. The latter is brought up like a peasant's child, cruelly treated by his grandfather and by the peasant to whose care he is confided, his mother, the Countess Louis Steinruck, having married an adventurer and a gambler. He is the rough hero of the tale, the Saint Michael of that war with evil which is life; while Raoul, spoiled by his grandfather and his French mother, betrays his country and tarnishes his name. At every step in the narrative these two young men come into collision. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> of character, a clash of personalities. Michael is proud, stern and noble. Raoul is weak, charming and evil. Michael has the world against him and conquers. Raoul has the world on his side and loses. The whole story is full of movement and life, and {{the psychology of the}} characters is displayed by action not by analysis, by deeds not by description. Though there are three long volumes, we do not tire of the tale. It has truth, passion and power, and there are no better things than these in fiction.|$|E
6000|$|The {{prevailing}} {{topic in}} the smoking-room upstairs was {{the inability of the}} War Office to deal with the flood of recruits that was pouring in, and its hostility to any such volunteering as Mr. Britling had in mind. Quite a number of members wanted to volunteer; there was much talk of their fitness; [...] "I'm fifty-four," [...] said one, [...] "and I could do my twenty-five miles in marching kit far better than half those boys of nineteen." [...] Another was thirty-eight. [...] "I must hold the business together," [...] he said; [...] "but why anyhow shouldn't I learn to shoot and use a bayonet?" [...] The personal pique of the rejected lent force to their criticisms of the recruiting and general organisation. [...] "The War Office has one incurable system," [...] said a big mine-owner. [...] "During peace time it runs all its home administration with men who will certainly be wanted at the front directly <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>war.</b> Directly war comes, therefore, there is a shift all round, and a new untried man--usually a dug-out in an advanced state of decay--is stuck into the job. Chaos follows automatically. The War Office always has done this, and so far as one can see it always will. It seems incapable of realising that another man will be wanted until the first is taken away. Its imagination doesn't even run to that." ...|$|E
