40|$|Abstract—Recent {{studies have}} shown that a {{significant}} portion of the total energy consumption of many data centers is caused by the inefficient operation of their cooling systems. Without effective thermal monitoring with accurate location information, the cooling systems often use unnecessarily low temperature set points <b>to</b> <b>overcool</b> the entire room, resulting in excessive energy consumption. Sensor network technology has recently been adopted for data-center thermal monitoring because of its non-intrusive nature for the already complex data center facilities and robustness to instantaneous CPU or disk activities. However, existing solutions place sensors in a simplistic way without considering the thermal dynamics in data centers, resulting in unnecessarily degraded hot server detection probability. In this paper, we first formulate the problem of sensor placement for hot server detection in a data center as a constrained optimization problem. We then propose a novel placement scheme based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to take various factors, such as cooling systems and server layout, as inputs to analyze the thermal conditions of the data center. Based on the CFD analysis in various server overheating scenarios, we apply data fusion and advanced optimization techniques to find a near-optimal sensor placement solution, such that the probability of detecting hot servers is significantly improved. Our empirical results in a real server room demonstrate the detection performance of our placement solution. Extensive simulation results also show that the proposed solution outperforms a commonly used placement solution in terms of detection probability. I...|$|E
40|$|The power {{required}} to cool IT equipment will soon exceed the energy {{needed to run}} the system. Even without {{the introduction of the}} new generation of power-hungry blade servers, the accelerating energy requirements of data centres are making them more expensive and unstable to run. Jeremy Hartley explains why it is physics and not money that will solve the problems. Electricity bills are often not considerations in the budgets or strategies of IT managers so there is no incentive on the ground for cutting power consumption – so concerns over high availability take precedence. However, the new generation of blade servers are not only incredibly power-hungry, but also deeper than traditional servers, and so will be more difficult to cool. This will inevitably lead to a power surge when data centres start to adopt this technology, moving energy consumption up the agenda. The IT industry is under pressure to reduce its energy consumption. According to a report by McKinsey 1, the industry as a whole consumes 2 per cent of the world energy now and will generate as much CO 2 as the airline industry by 2020. There are already restrictions on the location of data centres {{as a result of their}} energy demands. In addition, the EU has launched a Best Practice Code of Conduct for data centres, which aims to encourage data centre owners and operators to voluntarily sign up to have the energy efficiency of their operations measured, and agree to an action plan and an annual progress report. Many data centre managers are under the illusion that to maintain optimum temperatures in the data centre you need <b>to</b> <b>overcool</b> the supply air. The truth is that you need to create conditions that make the servers ’ own fans work more effectively, and this can be achieved by improving airflow management. Airflow management cuts costs by reducing the volume of cooled air that needs to be supplied, and it will also improve the temperature distribution across the cabinets. In one study improved air management cut the energy consumption by over 20 per cent with savings increasing to over 3...|$|E

An area of significant interest is the integration of these systems with atria as their large glazed spaces [...] a widespread feature in modern building design [...] have an untapped potential to enhance natural/hybrid ventilation. This study presents experimental and complementary simulation results based on the long-term monitoring performed in an institutional building. The objective is to evaluate the performance of the building's natural ventilation system, examine its impact on the indoor conditions and assess its night cooling potential. Long-term monitoring consisted of temperature and airflow measurements at the top atrium of the building, along with pressure difference and airflow measurements at the exterior air inlet grilles in the upper building levels. Experiments also included night-time ventilation rates and slab temperature measurements at lower building levels. A mathematical model was developed to estimate the cooling storage capacity of the slab. The natural ventilation system at its present operation is able to cover only part of the building's cooling requirements. The application of modified ventilation strategies at night, making use of the building's thermal mass and cool outdoor air, holds a significant cooling potential.

40|$|For the {{analysis}} of boron dilution transients and main steam line break scenarios the modelling of the coolant mixing inside the reactor vessel is important. The reactivity insertion due <b>to</b> <b>overcooling</b> or deboration depends strongly on the coolant temperature and boron concentration. The three-dimensional flow distribution in the downcomer and the lower plenum of PWR's was calculated with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code (CFX- 4). Calculations were performed for the PWR's of SIEMENS KWU, Westinghouse and VVER- 440 / V- 230 type. The following important factors were identified: exact representation of the cold leg inlet region (bend radii etc.), extension of the downcomer below the inlet region at the PWR Konvoi, obstruction of the flow by the outlet nozzles penetrating the downcomer, etc. The k- turbulence model was used. Construction elements like perforated plates in the lower plenum have large influence on the velocity field. It is impossible to model all the orifi! ces in the perforated plates. A porous region model was used to simulate perforated plates and the core. The porous medium is added with additional body forces to simulate the pressure drop through perforated plates in the VVER- 440. For the PWR Konvoi the whole core was modelled with porous media parameters. The velocity fields of the PWR Konvoi calculated for the case of operation of all four main circulation pumps show a good agreement with experimental results. The CFD-calculation especially confirms the back flow areas below the inlet nozzles. The downcomer flow of the Russian VVER- 440 has no recirculation areas under normal operation conditions. By CFD calculations for the downcomer and the lower plenum an analytical mixing model used in the reactor dynamic code DYN 3 D was verified. The measurements, the analytical model and the CFD-calculations provided very well agreeing results particularly for the inlet region. The difficulties of analytical solutions and the uncertainties of turbulence models for the numerical solutions require additional experiments.

These simulations include gas cooling, star formation, a detailed treatment of stellar evolution and chemical enrichment, as well as SN energy feedback in the form of galactic winds. We compute the spectro-photometric properties of the simulated galaxies. All simulations have been performed for two choices of the stellar initial mass function: a standard Salpeter IMF, and a top-heavier IMF. Several of the observational properties of the galaxy population in nearby clusters are reproduced fairly well by simulations. A Salpeter IMF is successful in accounting for the slope and the normalization of the color-magnitude relation for the bulk of the galaxy population. Simulated clusters have a relation between mass and optical luminosity which generally agrees with observations, both in normalization and slope. We find that galaxies are generally bluer, younger and more star forming in the cluster outskirts, thus reproducing the observational trends. However, simulated clusters have a total number of galaxies which is significantly smaller than the observed one, falling short by about a factor 2 - 3.

The ductless operating principle of the underfloor ventilation system enhances space flexibility. Supplying conditioned air from the floor level also inherents advantages in improving indoor air quality and energy saving. Two types of the underfloor ventilation systems are commonly found including the top-level return type (TR) and the floor-level return type (FR). Thermal comfort and indoor air quality aspects of both the TR and the FR. underfloor systems were experimentally investigated in the present study. The most commonly used straight vane type floor supply diffusers were used in the experiments. The performance of traditional ceiling-based system with widely adopted 4 -way spread type supply diffusers was also determined under the same conditions for comparison purpose. A controlled experimental room was developed to facilitate the experiments. High risk of draught was observed near the supply outlet of the underfloor ventilation systems. However, draught discomfort can be reduced by the underfloor system compared to the ceiling based system. Similar to the traditional ceiling based system, vertical temperature differences in the occupied region were lower than 3 °C under all the tested conditions for the TR system. Temperature variations higher than the international comfort standards were observed with the FR system when Archimedes number (Ar) was higher than 0. 03. Lower Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) values were resulted with both types of underfloor ventilation systems compared to the ceiling-based one. Lower cooling effect should be provided when using the underfloor systems <b>to</b> avoid <b>overcooling</b> <b>to</b> the occupants.

40|$|High {{neutron flux}} in {{core of a}} nuclear reactor can affect the {{material}} of Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV). The neutron radiation has a detrimental impact on the mechanical properties of the RPV material such as hardening (or embrittlement) while neutrons are absorbed by the material. A major concern in embrittled RPVs is propagation of critical flaw which may cause through-wall cracks. Some transients leading <b>to</b> <b>overcooling</b> of RPV intensify the propagation of the cracks and known as Pressurized Thermal Shock (PTS). Such situation could be created in case of Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) actuation which leads to injection of cold water into the cold leg of the primary loop in some accidents, e. g. Loss Of Coolant Accident (LOCA). The investigation of PTS is performed throughout three steps including Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA); thermal-hydraulics and structural mechanics i. e. fracture mechanics. The final goal of the thermal-hydraulics analysis step is the prediction of the imposed temperature gradient on the downcomer {{as a result of}} single-phase and two-phase phenomena. Depending on the leak size, its location and the operation condition of the plant after LOCA, water in the cold leg can be in single-phase or two-phase condition. Two-phase PTS will occur when steam and water are in the cold leg during the injection of ECCS water. The ECCS water enters the hot steam flow environment in the cold leg and two phase stratified flow propagates in the cold leg by means of density difference between water and steam. Condensation of steam and mass transfer between two phases is the only heat source in this zone and the accurate modeling of DCC plays a significant role to predict temperature profile in downcomer. The interfacial heat transfer coefficient is defined according to eddy contact time with both steam and water at interface which is a function of turbulence characteristics. The high gradient of velocity generates too high turbulence when differential eddy viscosity models are used and some modifications should be considered in turbulence models at the interface. Implementation of turbulence damping function in turbulence eddy frequency transport equation is one of this modification. Although the new source function improves velocity profile of smooth stratified flow, but significant deviations reveal when the vertical motion of the interface is considerable. Also, the value of turbulence kinetic energy decreases substantially by employment of damping function without the other modification. The reduction of turbulence kinetic energy at the interface changes the value of heat transfer coefficient. In this paper, the other source function of turbulence is proposed by consideration of different boundary condition at the interface and the effect of turbulence characteristics on condensation rate is demonstrated. The results show that implementation of damping function, without any special treatment of turbulence kinetic energy, leads to a considerable overestimation of condensation rate which would be improved with employment of proposed turbulence source function at the interface. then, the new turbulence model is used for stratified flow zone in PTS scenario in VVER- 1000 RPV to find the effect of interfacial heat transfer coefficient on temperature profile in the cold leg. For this purpose, the plant response to LOCA is simulated by RELAP system code until the injection of ECCS water.

AGN feedback, which is required <b>to</b> prevent <b>overcooling,</b> has {{a significant impact on}} halo masses {{all the way up to}} cluster scales (M 200 ~ 10 ^ 15 Msun). Baryonic physics changes the total mass profiles of haloes out to several times the virial radius, a modification that cannot be captured by a change in the halo concentration. The decrease in the total halo mass causes a decrease in the halo mass function of about 20 %. This effect can have important consequences for abundance matching technique as well as for most semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. We provide analytic fitting formulae, derived from simulations that reproduce the observed baryon fractions, to correct halo masses and mass functions from DM-only simulations. The effect of baryonic physics (AGN feedback in particular) on cluster number counts is about as large as changing the cosmology from WMAP 7 to Planck, even when a moderately high mass limit of M 500 ~ 10 ^ 14 Msun is adopted.

The challenge is to couple this energy to the baryons efficiently enough, and to distribute the energy in a manner that will not contradict observational constraints of metalicity and entropy profiles. Here we propose that if {{a small fraction of the}} baryons that are accreted to the cluster halo are in the form of cold clumps, they would interact with the hot gas component via hydrodynamic drag. We show that such clumps carry enough energy, penetrate to the center, and heat the core significantly. We then study the dynamic response of the cluster to this kind of heating using a 1 D hydrodynamic simulation with sub-grid clump heating, and produce reasonable entropy profile in a dynamic self-consistent way.

40|$|Purpose: To {{explore the}} {{influence}} of body composition on thermal responses to cold water immersion (CWI) and the recovery of exercise performance. Methods: Male subjects were stratified into two groups; low fat (LF; n= 10); or high fat (HF; n= 10). Subjects completed a high intensity interval test (HIIT) on a cycle ergometer followed by 15 min recovery intervention (control (CON) or CWI). Core temperature (Tc), skin temperature (Tsk) and heart rate were recorded continuously. Performance was assessed at baseline, immediately post-HIIT and 40 min post-recovery using a 4 min cycling time trial (TT), countermovement jump (CMJ), and isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP) tests. Perceptual measures (thermal sensation (TS), total quality of recovery (TQR), soreness and fatigue) were also assessed. Results: Tc and TS were significantly lower in LF compared to HF from 10 min (Tc: LF 36. 5 ± 0. 5, HF 37. 2 ± 0. 6 °C; TS: LF 2. 3 ± 0. 5, HF 3. 0 ± 0. 7 arbitrary units (a. u.)) to 40 min (Tc: LF 36. 1 ± 0. 6, HF 36. 8 ± 0. 7 °C; TS: LF 2. 3 ± 0. 6, HF 3. 2 ± 0. 7 a. u.) following CWI (P< 0. 05). Recovery of TT performance was significantly enhanced following CWI in HF (10. 3 ± 6. 1 %) compared to LF (3. 1 ± 5. 6 %, P= 0. 01) however, no differences were observed between HF (6. 9 ± 5. 7 %) and LF (5. 4 ± 5. 2 %) with CON. No significant differences were observed between groups for CMJ, IMTP, TQR, soreness or fatigue in both conditions. Conclusion: Body composition influences the magnitude of Tc change during and following CWI. Additionally, CWI enhanced performance recovery in the HF group only. Therefore, body composition should be considered when planning CWI protocols <b>to</b> avoid <b>overcooling</b> and maximise performance recovery...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{study on the}} influence of pulsed electric signals applied <b>to</b> the <b>overcooling</b> of thermoelectric devices. To this end, an experimental setup taken from the literature and a commercial cell are simulated using a complete, specially developed research finite element code. The electro-thermal coupling is extended to include the elastic field, demonstrating that the increment of cooling can produce mechanical failure. Numerical results are developed and the variation of overcooling versus pulse gain and versus duration is validated towards a new analytical expression and the experimental data. The issue of optimal intensity at steady-state is also newly developed. Thermal and mechanical trends are presented using constant and variable (with temperature) material properties for a single thermoelement. While some of the first trends {{are similar to those of}} published works, others are different or directly new, all closer to those of the experiments. The mechanical results have not been thoroughly studied until recently. The three-dimensional finite element mesh includes non-thermoelectric materials that are fundamental for the current study. Distribution of stresses during steady and transient states are shown inside the thermoelement, for five components and for the combined Tresca stress. Concentrations at corners of the lower side appear close to the cold face. Due to these concentrations, 27 -node isoparametric, quadratic brick elements are used. It is shown that the mechanical field is an important factor in the design of pulsed thermoelectrics, since for practical applications the stress levels are close or slightly above the admissible limits.

40|$|Buildings in {{tropical}} {{countries such as}} Malaysia are exposed to excessive amount of solar heat during daytime occupancy. In addition to that, the outdoor air contains excessive humidity {{due to the nature}} of the climate. Air-conditioning system is the main energy consumer of the buildings, more so with the requirement of the full 12 months cooling period in the country. The increasing demand of energy due to its status as a developing country puts Malaysia in a critical situation in terms of building sustainability. Another quandary associated with tropical environment is the indoor thermal comfort due to the high humidity. The usage of normal air-conditioning system means that the room has <b>to</b> be <b>overcooled</b> in order <b>to</b> bring down the humidity. Unfortunately, the low temperature set-point technique is neither comfort cautious nor energy friendly. There is an option to solve the humidity problems by the use of the outdoor air treatment system which neutralizes the incoming fresh air into the room. However, high equipment cost renders the system unfavorable in Malaysia. Therefore, the viable solution to the high latent load requires an innovative system that is affordable, runs at relatively low energy consumption yet be able to provide satisfactory indoor thermal comfort. In the research, a new air-conditioning approach termed Dual ABU (air handling unit) system is proposed to be the answer. The simplicity in arrangement and control setup ensures that the system can be reasonably priced. On top of that, it can be designed as an add-on configuration to the existing air-conditioning. The function of Latent AHU in the proposed system is to remove moisture from the conditioned room up to the desired humidity level and in the process the room temperature is also fractionally reduced. The Sensible AHU completes the task by removing the remaining sensible heat so that the room temperature is maintained at the required set-point. By reducing the relative humidity to 50...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the mechanisms for the H-mode density limit in machines with fully metallic walls, systematic investigations of H-mode density limit plasmas in experiments with deuterium and hydrogen external gas fuelling have been performed on JET-ILW. The observed H-mode density limit on JET in D- as well as in H-plasmas demonstrates similar operation phases: the stable H-mode phase, degrading H-mode, breakdown of the H-mode with energy confinement deterioration accompanied by a dithering cycling phase, followed by the L-mode phase. The density limit is not related to an inward collapse of the hot core plasma due <b>to</b> an <b>overcooling</b> of the plasma periphery by radiation. Indeed, independently of the isotopic effect, the total radiated power stay almost constant during the H-mode phase until the H-L back transition. It was observed in D- and H-plasmas that neither detachment, nor the X-point MARFE itself do trigger the H-L transition and that they thus do not present a limit on the plasma density. It is the plasma confinement, most likely determined by edge parameters, which is ultimately responsible for the H-mode DL. By comparing similar discharges but fuelled with either deuterium or hydrogen, we have found that the H-mode density limit exhibits a dependence on the isotope mass: the density limit is up to 35 % lower in hydrogen compared to similar deuterium plasma conditions (the obtained density limit is in agreement with the Greenwald limit for D-plasma). In addition, the density limit is nearly independent of the applied power both in deuterium or hydrogen fuelling conditions. The measured Greenwald fractions are consistent with the predictions from a theoretical model based on an MHD instability theory in the near-SOL. The JET operational domains are significantly broadened when increasing the plasma effective mass (e. g. tritium or deuterium–tritium operation), i. e. the L to H power threshold is reduced whereas the density limit for the L-mode back transition is increased...|$|R
40|$|We discuss {{differences}} in simulation results that arise between {{the use of}} either the thermal energy or the entropy as an independent variable in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). In this context, we derive a new version of SPH that manifestly conserves both energy and entropy if smoothing lengths are allowed to adapt freely to the local mass resolution. To test various formu- lations of SPH, we consider point-like energy injection and find that powerful explosions are well represented by SPH even when the energy is deposited into a single particle, provided that the entropy equation is integrated. If the thermal energy is instead used as an independent variable, unphysical solutions can be obtained for this problem. We also examine the radiative cooling of gas spheres that collapse and virialize in isolation and of halos that form in cosmological simulations of structure formation. When applied to these problems, the thermal energy version of SPH leads <b>to</b> substantial <b>overcooling</b> in halos that are resolved with up to a few thousand particles, while the entropy formulation is biased only moderately low for these halos. For objects resolved with much larger particle numbers, the two approaches yield consistent results. We trace the origin of the differences to systematic resolution effects in the outer parts of cooling flows. The cumulative effect of this overcooling can be significant. In cosmological simulations of moderate size, we find that the fraction of baryons which cool and condense can be reduced by up to a factor ~ 2 if the entropy equation is employed rather than the thermal energy equation. We also demonstrate that the entropy method leads to a greatly reduced scatter in the density-temperature relation of the low-density Ly-alpha forest relative to the thermal energy approach, in accord with theoretical expectations.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of supernovae {{feedback}} on a disk galaxy, {{taking into account the}} impact of infalling gas on both the star formation history and the corresponding outflow structure, the apparition of a supernovae-driven wind being highly sensitive to the halo mass, the galaxy spin and the star formation efficiency. We model our galaxies as cooling and collapsing NFW spheres. The dark matter component is modelled as a static external potential, while the baryon component is described by the Euler equations using the AMR code RAMSES. Metal-dependent cooling and supernovae-heating are also implemented using state-of-the-art recipes coming from cosmological simulations. We allow for 3 parameters to vary: the halo circular velocity, the spin parameter and the star formation efficiency. We found that the ram pressure of infalling material is the key factor limiting the apparition of galactic winds. We obtain a very low feedback efficiency, with supernovae to wind energy conversion factor around one percent, so that only low cicrular velocity galaxies give rise to strong winds. For massive galaxies, we obtain a galatic fountain, for which we discuss the observational properties. We conclude that for quiescent isolated galaxies, galactic winds appear only in very low mass systems. Although that can quite efficiently enrich the IGM with metals, they don't carry away enough cold material <b>to</b> solve the <b>overcooling</b> problem.

40|$|Benchmark {{calculations}} for the {{validation of}} the coupled neutron kinetics/thermohydraulic code complex DYN 3 D-ATHLET are described. Two benchmark problems concerning hypothetical accident scenarios with leaks in the steam system for a VVER- 440 type reactor and the TMI- 1 PWR have been solved. The first benchmark task has been defined by FZR {{in the frame of}} the international association "Atomic Energy Research" (AER), the second exercise has been organised {{under the auspices of the}} OECD. While in the first benchmark the break of the main steam collector in the sub-critical hot zero power state of the reactor was considered, the break of one of the two main steam lines at full reactor power was assumed in the OECD benchmark. Therefore, in this exercise the mixing of the coolant from the intact and the defect loops had to be considered, while in the AER benchmark the steam collector break causes a homogeneous overcooling of the primary circuit. In the AER benchmark, each participant had to use its own macroscopic cross section libraries. In the OECD benchmark, the cross sections were given in the benchmark definition. The main task of both benchmark problems was to analyse the re-criticality of the scrammed reactor due <b>to</b> the <b>overcooling.</b> For both benchmark problems, a good agreement of the DYN 3 D-ATHLET solution with the results of other codes was achieved. Differences in the time of re-criticality and the height of the power peak between various solutions of the AER benchmark can be explained by the use of different cross section data. Significant differences in the thermohydraulic parameters (coolant temperature, pressure) occurred only at the late stage of the transient during the emergency injection of highly borated water. In the OECD benchmark, a broader scattering of the thermohydraulic results can be observed, while a good agreement between the various 3 D reactor core calculations with given thermohydraulic boundary conditions was achieved. Reasons for the differences in the thermohydraulics were assumed in the difficult modelling of the vertical once-through steam generator with steam superheating. Sensitivity analyses which considered the influence of the nodalisation and the impact of the coolant mixing model were performed for the DYN 3 D-ATHLET solution of the OECD benchmark. The solution of the benchmarks essentially contributed to the qualification of the code complex DYN 3 D-ATHLET as an advanced tool for the accident analysis for both VVER type reactors and Western PWRs...|$|R
30|$|Even {{though some}} of the {{arguments}} are not fully explicit, there are several hidden assumptions that run counter to our current knowledge in macroeconomics. In particular, a major argument behind the sovereign money proposal is that controlling money allows the stabilization of credit. 7 This in turn will help stabilize the business cycle. If this is left to commercial banks, HR write: “They expand credit creation in upswings, and reduce it in downswings. The result is that bank-created money positively contributes <b>to</b> overheating and <b>overcooling</b> business cycles, amplifying their peaks and troughs,...(p. 37)”. However, HR provide no evidence for their claim. While their first sentence is correct, there are two fundamental problems with their second sentence. First, there is little empirical evidence that money amplifies business cycles in modern economies. On the contrary, bank deposits tend to decline before financial crises (see Jordá et al., 2017). Second, the link between money and credit is weak. As I discuss below, there is no correlation between changes in money and changes in credit in Switzerland. Looking at developed economies, Schularick and Taylor (2012) show there was a close link between credit and broad money before World War II, but there has been a decoupling after World War II. Schularick and Taylor also discuss the distinction between the “money view” and the “credit view” in macroeconomics. The defenders of sovereign money clearly worry about credit, but they want to control it by controlling money. This perspective is inconsistent with empirical evidence.|$|R
