5|$|At Chelsea, Fàbregas {{played a}} similar playmaking role in midfield, using his technique, ball control, vision, and passing ability to dictate the tempo of his team's play, {{while he was}} {{supported}} by defensive midfielders, {{in order to give}} him more space and <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ball. In this deeper creative role, he excelled in Chelsea's new style of play under Mourinho, where he proved to be an effective assist-provider.|$|E
5|$|Because of this, he {{was later}} moved to a {{deep-lying}} playmaker role by his coaches Mazzone, Fatih Terim, and Ancelotti, where {{he was able to}} excel due to his unique capabilities. This position best utilised Pirlo's attributes, and allowed him to operate creatively from a deeper position, in or even behind the main midfield line, in a seemingly defensive midfield role, where he was allowed more <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ball to create scoring opportunities with his trademark long balls. During his final season with Milan, Pirlo was also used on the wing under Allegri, due to his ability to provide accurate crosses.|$|E

5000|$|Grande sonnerie (French, meaning 'grand strike') is a {{complication}} in {{a mechanical}} watch or clock which combines a quarter striking mechanism with a repeater. On every quarter-hour it strikes {{the number of}} quarter hours audibly on a gong, and then {{the number of hours}} since <b>the</b> last hour <b>on</b> a second gong. For instance, in a 3 weight Vienna regulator wall clock, at 6:15 it would strike once on a high pitched gong, then strike six <b>times</b> <b>on</b> a lower pitched gong. At 6:30 it would strike twice <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high pitched gong, then six <b>times</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower pitched gong. At 6:45 three <b>times</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high pitched gong, then six <b>times</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower pitched gong, and at 7:00 it would strike four <b>times</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high pitched gong, then seven <b>times</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower pitched gong. You will always know the exact time every fifteen minutes just by listening to the striking. These types of striking clocks are mostly found as French Carriage Clocks, or German three weight Vienna regulators. In addition they can strike the quarters and hours on demand, by activating a repeating mechanism at the push of a button, or the pull of a string. [...] The term is sometimes used erroneously for a mere quarter striking mechanism.|$|R
