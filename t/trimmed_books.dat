5000|$|There is an {{additional}} paper size, 8 × 10+1/ 2 in, to which the name Government-Letter was given by the IEEE Printer Working Group (PWG). It was prescribed by Herbert Hoover when he was Secretary of Commerce {{to be used for}} US government forms, apparently to enable discounts from the purchase of paper for schools, but more likely due to the standard use of <b>trimming</b> <b>books</b> (after binding) and paper from the standard letter size paper to produce consistency and allow [...] "bleed" [...] printing. In later years, as photocopy machines proliferated, citizens wanted to make photocopies of the forms, but the machines did not generally have this size paper in their bins. Ronald Reagan therefore had the US government switch to regular Letter size, which is both half an inch longer and wider. The former government size is still commonly used in spiral-bound notebooks, for children's writing and the like, a result of trimming from the current Letter dimensions.|$|R

40|$|On-demand binding {{requires}} {{books to}} be printed and finished in quick turnaround time. In order {{to serve the}} on-demand binding market, the binders have the options of hot melt adhesives or cold emulsion adhesives. Cold emulsion adhesive bookbinding has been available in the industry for a long time. In the past few years, this type of binding process was more favorable as compared to hot melt because of its durability, flexibility, and strength. But the process of cold emulsion binding faced a serious drawback of curing time where the bound bookblock requires {{a minimum of two}} hrs. of curing time before <b>trimming</b> when <b>books</b> are cured naturally. As of recent technological advancement, it is possible now to bind a book by cold emulsion adhesive and trim it in 15 minutes after forced cured. This process is offered by Planax North America, Inc. There has been no testing done where the study evaluates the two different curing processes for cold emulsion adhesives, namely natural curing and accelerated curing on a preheated plate. Consequently, this thesis research investigates both curing processes. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate which curing process is better suited for cold emulsion adhesives. This was accomplished by comparing page-pull and page-flex values taken from thirty five books cured by each curing process (total of seventy books). Moffett page-pull and page-flex testing equipment were used for this test. It was found that natural curing resulted in higher page-pull values whereas forced curing resulted in higher page-flex. However, it was noticed that both types of curing process resulted in page-pull and page-flex values within the recommended industrial bookbinding guidelines. It can be inferred that on-demand books can be cured by forced curing which ultimately results into faster turnaround for production benefits yet books are within the industrial guidelines in regard to page-pull and page-flex strength values...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Expert level opening {{knowledge}} is beneficial to game playing programs. Unfortunately, expert level opening {{knowledge is}} only sparsely available for 9 Ã 9 Go. We set to build expert level opening books for 9 Ã 9 Go. Approach: We present two completely {{different approaches to}} build opening books for 9 Ã 9 Go without relying on human Go expertise. The first approach is based on game outcome statistics on opening sequences from 300, 000 actual 9 Ã 9 Go games played by computer programs. The second approach uses off-line stage-wise Monte-Caro tree search. Results: After âsolution treeâ style <b>trimming,</b> the opening <b>books</b> are compact {{and can be used}} effectively. Testing results show that GoIntellect using the opening books is 4 % stronger than GoIntellect without the opening books in terms of winning rates against Gnugo and other programs. In addition, using an opening book makes the program 10 % faster. Conclusion: Classical knowledge and search approach does not work well in the game of Go. Recent development in Monte-Carlo tree search brings a breakthrough and new hope-computer programs have started challenging human experts in 9 Ã 9 Go. A well constructed opening book can further advance {{the state of the art}} in computer Go...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} an {{exposition}} of the 1967 Annals paper by Parthasarathy, Ranga Rao, and Varadarajan, on irreducible admissible Harish-Chandra modules over complex semisimple Lie groups and Lie algebras. It {{was written in}} Winter 2012 {{to be part of}} a special collection organized to mark 10 years and 25 volumes of the series "Texts and Readings in Mathematics (TRIM) ". Each article in this collection is intended to give nonspecialists in its field, an appreciation for the impact and contributions of the paper being surveyed. Thus, the author has kept the prerequisites for this article down to a basic course on complex semisimple Lie algebras. While it arose out of the grand program of Harish-Chandra on admissible representations of semisimple Lie groups, the work by Parthasarathy et al also provided several new insights on highest weight modules and related areas, and these results have been the subject of extensive research over the last four decades. Thus, we also discuss its results and follow-up works on the classification of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules; on the PRV conjecture and tensor product multiplicities; and on PRV determinants for (quantized) affine and semisimple Lie algebras.

40|$|International audienceIn 2012, our library {{initiated}} a mass-digitization project {{of all the}} Ph. D. theses produced at the university since its creation in 1834. The goal was twofold: improving the visibility and accessibility of our scientific research and freeing space {{for the development of}} our learning centers. Over ten thousand volumes and three million pages needed to be digitized. We decided not to outsource the project to a vendor but to perform it fully in-house. This choice offered several advantages: we kept full control over the production, it was less expensive and, once in place, the infrastructure could be reused for other projects. After three consecutive years of intensive work, our digitizing project is now about to end. This poster describes the main characteristics of our digitization workflow custom-designed to fit our dissemination and preservation requirements. The workflow handles each step from the collection of paper volumes on bookshelves to the online release of the corresponding digitized objects in our institutional repository and their storage in our preservation repository. While the most prestigious theses have to be digitized with a non-destructive book scanner, other paper volumes are to be sent for destruction and recycling. Most theses can thus be digitized with a production feeder scanner after <b>trimming</b> the <b>book</b> binding. Thesis volumes are duplex-scanned twice with ultrasonic multi-feed hardware detection and multiple page count verification. The first pass produces raw uncompressed TIFF images dedicated for preservation and keeping all the features of the original paper version. The second pass produces JPEG images optimized for dissemination by automatic image quality improvement filters (background whitening, sharpness, color calibration). Quality assurance was paramount in the design of our workflow. It is fully automated to lower the risk of human error: metadata is directly extracted from the library catalog to generate QR identification barcode. All generated files are automatically named based on the barcode content. Quality assurance is also supported by custom-designed quality control software. Quality control is always performed with the original in hand. The application allows the operator to report quality issues both in the digitized object and in the original paper object. Every week, this workflow generates up to half a terabyte of raw images which would be too costly to preserve. For preservation purposes, raw images are thus migrated to visually lossless JPEG 2000 format for one tenth the original image size with the same quality of experience. The image quality degradation due to compression is automatically controlled with image comparison metrics. For dissemination purposes, ocerized PDFs are generated from the JPEG files with ABBYY OCR 11 with mixed-raster content technology to provide the best trade-off between image quality and file size. Dissemination and preservation copies are referenced in the institutional repository using a custom-designed METS profile. The workflow outlined in this abstract is designed to be generic and thus can be reused for our other in-house digitizing projects...|$|R
