Although not well known, these {{technologies}} provide better results than conventional cooking and drying methods {{in terms of}} economy, ecology, food quality and ease of use. Liberally and colourfully illustrated, this practical guide presents step-by-step methods for building and using a box cooker, a solar panel cooker, a direct solar drier and an indirect solar drier. Simple to make and use independently, the technologies provide an economical way to meet the food processing needs of diverse populations. The solar cooker saves time, money and energy, {{and can be used}} to cook all types of food (vegetables, fruits, meat, cereals, bread etc.). Although solar cooking is slower than traditional cooking methods, it consequently enables the production of healthier dishes, preserving both taste and nutrients. Compared to air-drying, solar driers allow better preservation of food quality. With higher temperatures, solar drying is also quicker and much more thorough. Furthermore, it reduces health risks by eliminating contamination from mould, insects, animals, dust and many other threats. Topics covered in this inspirational text include types of cookers/driers, construction and use, and a handy <b>table</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs.</b> Finally the guide has a useful chapter providing further reading and contacts.

The primary objective {{of this study was to}} determine the energy expenditures of high school girls during three segments of the school day using respirometry and heart rate telemetry techniques. Ten girls with a mean age of 16. 8 years served as subjects for this study. Regression equations of heart rate versus caloric expenditure were established for each subject. These were used to calculate average energy expenditure for each subject during class, during physical education class and during after school hours based on mean heart rate. The mean value of energy expenditure for class activities was 0. 88, sd ?? 0. 42 kilocalories per minute. During physical education class energy expenditure for the group was 2. 42, sd ?? 0. 2 0 kilocalories per minute. After school the girls expended 1. 95 sd ?? 0. 40 kilocalories per minute. Mean energy expenditure for the entire day was 2. 09, sd ?? 0. 35 kilocalories per minute. Energy expenditures were also calculated for the reclining,sitting and standing positions. These values were 0. 88, sd ?? 0. 19; 1. 22, sd ?? 0. 20; and 0. 54, sd ?? 0. 60 kilocalories per minute respectively. In addition three- day caloric intake and three-day activity diaries were obtained for each subject. The girls as a group are considered very sedentary. They spend 97. 7 percent of their time in sleep, very light and light activities. Only 1. 8 per cent of their time is spent in moderate activity and 0. 04 per cent of their time is spent in strenuous activity.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{two aspects}} of credit card repayment decisions: {{the extent to which}} the anchoring effect of minimum repayment information may be mitigated by information on alternative anchors, specifically repayments that would repay the balance in two years (Study 1) or nine months (Study 2); and the role of future repayment concern. In two experiments, three realistic credit card statements were presented with different outstanding balances. Participants, who were randomly allocated to one of four information conditions depending on supplementary information provided on the statements, stated how much they would repay that month. They were then asked about concerns they would have about repayment difficulties if they had a fixed consumer loan over three years. In Study 1 the alternative two-year repayment anchor had a negative effect on percent repayment, whereas in Study 2 the nine-month repayment anchor had a significant positive effect, especially for those with higher future repayment concern. Also, in both studies, future repayment concern had a direct inverse effect on repayment decisions which partially mediated the effect of disposable income. It is concluded that the addition to credit card statements <b>of</b> a <b>table</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> and duration information for a range of repayment amounts may usefully support repayment decisions...|$|R

40|$|Right-of-way (R/W) {{acquisitions}} can be {{a significant}} component of a project’s total cost. When owners reject the compensation offered for their properties as insufficient, the project comes to a halt until an agreement can be reached and increased funding can be obtained. Moreover, the process of condemnation can delay project completion. The availability of accurate and consistent estimation tools is therefore essential to planning projects, meeting budget constraints, and avoiding project delays. In 2002, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) embarked on Research Project 0 - 4079, in which 285 R/W records from six major districts were used to investigate the relationship between parcel characteristics and parcel taking cost along Texas corridors. From these R/W records, hedonic price models were developed {{to serve as a}} cost estimation tool for R/W acquisitions. As a follow up, Implementation Project 5 - 4079 was commissioned in 2005 with the purpose of testing and re-calibrating the price models using data from an additional 500 parcels in five other different districts.

40|$|Transportation {{problems}} {{are related to}} the transport of a product from some sources to a number of different destination. In general, the different delivery will produce different shipping cost, therefore the purpose of solving classic transportation problems with the allocation of delivery from the source to destination is to determine the minimum transportation costs. The appropriate allocating in each case will produce an optimal solution for both minimize case and maximize case. TOCM-SUM approach with the indicator distribution is a new method for seeking initial feasible solution of the transportation problem. This method was proposed by Aminur Rahman Khan, Adrian Vilcu, MD. Sharif Uddin and FlorinaUngureanu. The first step is create a <b>table</b> <b>of</b> transportation, the second step is reduce the elements in each row and column with the smallest elements in every row and column, the third case is form the <b>tables</b> <b>of</b> Total Opportunity <b>Cost</b> Matrix (TOCM), the fourth case is calculate the indicators of distribution of each row and column in the TOCM table, and thereafter, the allocation is given to the cell that has the minimum distribution indicator. Repeat the steps until the total allocation of supply and demand is met, for optimal solutions the method of Stepping Stone is being used.

40|$|We {{explore a}} method for {{computing}} admissible heuristic evaluation functions for search problems. It utilizes pattern databases (Culberson & Schae er, 1998), which are precomputed <b>tables</b> <b>of</b> the exact <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> solving various subproblems of an existing problem. Unlike standard pattern database heuristics, however, we partition our problems into disjoint subproblems, so that the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> solving the di erent subproblems can be added together without overestimating the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> solving the original problem. Previously (Korf & Felner, 2002) we showed how to statically partition the sliding-tile puzzles into disjoint groups of tiles to compute an admissible heuristic, using the same partition for each state and problem instance. Here we extend the method and show that it applies to other domains as well. We also present another method for additive heuristics which we call dynamically partitioned pattern databases. Here we partition the problem into disjoint subproblems for each state of the search dynamically. We discuss {{the pros and cons}} of each of these methods and apply both methods to three di erent problem domains: the sliding-tile puzzles, the 4 -peg Towers of Hanoi problem, and nding an optimal vertex cover of a graph. We nd that in some problem domains, static partitioning is most e ective, while in others dynamic partitioning is a better choice.

These examples demonstrate how several capabilities of the PVS language and verification system can be used in combination to provide customized support for specific methodologies for documenting and analyzing requirements. Because they use only the standard capabilities of PVS, users can adapt and extend these customizations to suit their own needs. Those developing dedicated tools for individual methodologies may find these constructions in PVS helpful for prototyping purposes, or as a useful adjunct to a dedicated tool when the capabilities of a full theorem prover are required. The examples also illustrate the power and utility of an integrated general-purpose system such as PVS.
