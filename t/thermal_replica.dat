40|$|Encounters between big game, {{such as the}} moose, {{and private}} cars often result in severe {{injuries}} and death. A vehicle-based moose detection early warning system is a technical countermeasure to increase the traffic safety by alerting the driver in case of danger. Based on available off-the-shelf consumer electronics, a infrared night vision system was built {{to serve as a}} platform for experiments with moose early warning driver assistance systems. Aspects of a moose <b>thermal</b> <b>replica</b> employing a horse are discussed and typical vehicle-moose movements are directed and recorded to form a publicly available database for research and education.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{nonlinear}} cotunneling spectroscopy of a carbon nanotube quantum dot coupled to Nb superconducting contacts. Our measurements show rich subgap features in the stability diagram which become more pronounced as the temperature is increased. Applying a transport theory based on the Liouville-von Neumann equation for the density matrix, we show that the transport properties {{can be attributed to}} processes involving sequential as well as elastic and inelastic cotunneling of quasiparticles thermally excited across the gap. In particular, we predict <b>thermal</b> <b>replicas</b> of the elastic and inelastic cotunneling peaks, in agreement with our experimental results...|$|R

Modifications include a re-skinning of the exterior, <b>replica</b> <b>thermal</b> tiles, publicly accessible mid-deck and payload bay, a glass cockpit on the flight deck, and display cases with shuttle program artifacts.|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of cellular heterogeneity within cell populations has been increasingly realized in recent years. As a result, {{there has been}} a focus on developing methods for single cell analysis. µCP represents a cheap, simple and versatile method for producing microarrays across a substrate surfaces. The microarrays can be utilized for cell immobilization, which can be coupled to microscopy techniques. There is also an increased interest in using AFM for cell studies, which requires immobilization The focus of this thesis was to develop a method for µCP of PLL to facilitate immobilization of S. cerevisiae on a glass substrate. The idea is to create a pattern that enables immobilization of single cells of S. cerevisiae to achieve SCA. A photolithography procedure was developed to create a master mould for replica moulding. An even film thickness was achieved, but there were persistent problems with edge bead and cracks in the resist due to <b>thermal</b> stress. <b>Replica</b> moulding was used to make PDMS stamps on the created master mould. AFM analysis showed irregularities in the stamps corresponding to the cracks observed in the resist, which resulted in poor conformal contact between the stamp and the substrate surface. The parameters of the replica moulding method were verified using a pre-made master mould to create stamps. This showed that the process was suitable for creating PDMS stamps with micrometre scale features. The stamps were used to demonstrate that PDMS stamps could be used to print PLL in a micrometre scale pattern. It was also demonstrated that S. cerevisiae could be immobilized on glass substrates functionalized with PLL...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{uniaxial}} tensile strength after <b>thermal</b> cycling in <b>replicas</b> of CeraOne®abutments (abutment and coping sets), using four types of cements (n = 10). A zinc phosphate cement (Fosfato de Zinco®/ SSW), a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RelyX®luting / 3 M-ESPE), a zinc oxide-eugenol cement (ZOE®/ SSW) and a zinc oxide cement without eugenol (TempBond NE®/ KERR) were used. After cementation, the samples were submitted to thermal cycles (1, 000 cycles, 5 ºC ± 2 º to 55 ºC ± 2 º) for thirty seconds in each bath. Next, the samples were submitted to the tensile test in a universal test machine (0. 5 mm/min). The data were submitted to ANOVA and the Tukey-Kramer test (p < 0. 05), and statistically significant difference was found among the cements. The highest tensile strength mean value found was for zinc phosphate cement (33. 6 kgf) followed by the resin-modified glass ionomer cement (20. 5 kgf), zinc oxide-eugenol cement (8. 4 kgf) and the temporary cement (3. 1 kgf). Therefore, it was found that the permanent cements presented higher tensile strength, and the temporary cement could be used in situations requiring reversibility and the removal of cemented dental implant-supported prostheses...|$|R
40|$|The present work investigates surface-liquid-interactions {{that occur}} on neotropical flat bugs from the genus Dysodius (Aradidae) and {{selected}} European true bugs (Heteroptera). In case of Dysodius water- {{as well as}} oil-based interaction are researched. The former enabling the fascinating phenomenon called “adaptive camouflage” on these bugs, the latter concerning directional, passive fluid transport in the external scent efferent system (defense secretion system). European bugs are investigated with regard to comparable functionality of their scent efferent system only. Morphological studies are carried out by means of scanning- and transmission electron microscopy in order to extract fluid-interaction relevant body features. Chemical studies, like GC-MS and HPLC-MS, are used as means to figure chemical composition of surface waxes. Fluid-flow studies are carried out via high-speed video capturing, followed by custom algorithm analysis {{with the goal of}} understanding the surface-fluid-interaction dynamics. By means of laser ablation and casting, different materials (like steel and polymers) are provided with artificial fluid-transport channels, biomimetically abstracted from the bugs and their performance is analyzed by above mentioned techniques. In the end of this work a novel approach for the fabrication of <b>thermal</b> conductive all-metal <b>replicas</b> of biological samples is presented that will enable even more sophisticated investigation ways for phenomena like evaporation and condensation in the future...|$|R
