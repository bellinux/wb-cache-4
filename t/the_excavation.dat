From 1892 until 1899 Bulleid worked with labourers for six months of each year and spent the other six months describing and cataloguing the finds. He then left the site to complete his medical studies and returned in 1904 with Harold St George Gray to continue <b>the</b> <b>excavation</b> until 1907. The curator of the Taunton museum of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society, Gray had been trained in archaeological techniques by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers.|$|E

5|$|Cobalt {{has been}} used to color glass since the Bronze Age. <b>The</b> <b>excavation</b> of the Uluburun {{shipwreck}} yielded an ingot of blue glass, cast during the 14th century BC. Blue glass items from Egypt are colored with copper, iron, or cobalt. The oldest cobalt-colored glass is from the Eighteenth dynasty in Egypt (1550–1292 BC). The source of that cobalt is unknown.|$|E

40|$|In autumn 1969, {{studying}} at the Institute of Prehistory in Leiden, Karel J. H. Vriezen supervised <b>the</b> <b>excavations</b> of a Late Bronze Age urn field in Hilvarenbeek (the Netherlands), {{as an assistant}} to G. J. Verwers. In spring 1970 he assisted P. J. R. Modderman in <b>the</b> <b>excavations</b> of a Bandkeramik settlement in Hienheim (Bavaria). In 1972, he became assistant-director of the German Evangelical Institute for the Archaeology of the Holy Land in Jerusalem and directed <b>the</b> <b>excavations</b> under <b>the</b> Church of the Redeemer in the Old City of Jerusalem (1972 - 1974). In 1975 Vriezen returned to the Netherlands and as a (senior) lecturer at Utrecht University, and co-directed together with Ute Wagner-Lux <b>the</b> <b>excavations</b> in <b>the</b> Hellenistic through Medieval city of Gadara (Umm Qays, Jordan; 1974 - 2000) and together with Dieter Vieweger <b>the</b> <b>excavations</b> in Tall Zarca (Ziraca) in Jordan (2001 - 2002) ...|$|R
50|$|He {{was part}} of the leading {{directory}} of <b>the</b> major <b>excavations</b> in Olympia (1874-81), and took part in the planning of the whole enterprise, which was at first scheduled to last no more than five years. At one point, he was even leader of <b>the</b> <b>excavations.</b> He was also the editor, together with Ernst Curtius, of the publication of <b>the</b> <b>excavations</b> report.|$|R
5|$|On this basis, due to {{a concern}} that <b>the</b> <b>excavation</b> should be {{conducted}} using scientific archaeological methods, and since this was the oldest shipwreck site to be examined in the Western Hemisphere, the state launched a suit against Platoro.|$|E
5|$|The broch shows more {{evidence}} of David Balfour's influence on Shapinsay. He arranged for the site to be excavated by the archaeologists George Petrie and Sir William Dryden in 1861. The site was neglected after <b>the</b> <b>excavation,</b> slowly filling up with vegetation and rubble before being cleared in 1994.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>excavation</b> of Lake Burley Griffin {{began in}} 1960 with the {{clearing}} of vegetation from the floodplain of the Molonglo River. The {{trees on the}} golf course and along the river were pulled up, along with the various sports grounds and houses.|$|E
40|$|The {{modes of}} pipe roof {{technology}} implementation {{in order to}} stabilize <b>the</b> <b>excavations</b> on <b>the</b> "Javorova Kosa" and "Pod Vugles" Tunnels are described in the paper. Both tunnels are specific regarding their geological structure and geo-technical characteristics of the rock mass in which <b>the</b> <b>excavations</b> were performed as well as regarding the mutual distance of 50 m measured alongside the highway axis. The multiphase New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM) was used for <b>the</b> <b>excavations</b> in weak rock/soil (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|R

The large works were restored and put on display in the king's museum at Portici. The smaller works were generally not exhibited. <b>The</b> <b>excavations</b> were done by slaves, and it seems that much was destroyed or stolen. News of the finds spread, and Charles drew criticism for the secrecy and lack of science in <b>the</b> <b>excavations.</b>|$|R

5|$|Turning his {{attention}} to southern India, Wheeler discovered remnants of a Roman amphora in a museum, and began excavations at Arikamedu, revealing a port from the first century CE which had traded in goods from the Roman Empire. <b>The</b> <b>excavation</b> had been plagued by severe rains and tropical heat, although it was during <b>the</b> <b>excavation</b> that World War II ended; in celebration, Wheeler gave all his workers an extra rupee for the day. It has since been alleged that while Wheeler took credit for discovering {{the significance of this}} site, it had previously been established by A. Aiyappan, the Superintendent of the Government Museum in Madras, and the French archaeologist Jouveau Dubreuil, with Wheeler intentionally ignoring their contribution. He later undertook excavations of six megalithic tombs in Brahmagiri, Mysore, which enabled him to gain a chronology for the archaeology of much of southern India.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{excavation}} – The Classics Department sponsors an excavation at Castel Viscardo, a city near Orvieto in Italy. Faculty {{and students}} from the college are excavating a site that was occupied from the early Etruscan to the late Roman periods. <b>The</b> <b>excavation</b> have yielded many historical and archaeological finds; Saint Anselm College sends over 25 students each summer to the Coriglia excavation, just outside town.|$|E
50|$|After the Six Day War, the Ministry of Religious Affairs of Israel began <b>the</b> <b>excavations</b> {{aimed at}} exposing the {{continuation}} of the Western Wall. <b>The</b> <b>excavations</b> lasted almost twenty years and revealed many previously unknown facts about the history and geography of the Temple Mount.|$|R

5|$|Between 1908 and 1922, Spruce Tree House, Cliff Palace, and Sun Temple ruins were stabilised. Most of {{the early}} efforts were led by Jesse Walter Fewkes. During the 1930s and 40s, Civilian Conservation Corps workers, {{starting}} in 1932, played key roles in excavation efforts, building trails and roads, creating museum exhibits and constructing buildings at Mesa Verde. From 1958 to 1965, Wetherill Mesa Archaeological Project included archaeological excavations, stabilization of sites, and surveys. With excavation and study of eleven Wetherill Mesa sites, it is considered the largest archaeological effort in the US. The project oversaw <b>the</b> <b>excavation</b> of Long House and Mug House.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} Pullman Square on July 16, 2004 with <b>the</b> <b>excavation</b> {{of the parking}} lot for the parking structures. It opened on November 19, 2004 with Marquee Cinemas. Others, such as Empire Books & News, EB Games and Starbucks, opened in early December. In June 2005, the Funny Bone Comedy Club opened, {{followed}} by Cold Stone Creamery in July and pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill and Max & Erma's in August.|$|E
5|$|Construction was {{not without}} incident. In May 1860, a GNR train {{overshot}} the platform at King's Cross and fell into the workings. Later in 1860, a boiler explosion on an engine pulling contractor's wagons killed the driver and his assistant. In May 1861, <b>the</b> <b>excavation</b> collapsed at Euston causing considerable damage to the neighbouring buildings. The final accident occurred in June 1862 when the Fleet sewer burst following a heavy rainstorm and flooded the excavations. The Met and the Metropolitan Board of Works managed to stem and divert {{the water and the}} construction was delayed by only a few months.|$|E
