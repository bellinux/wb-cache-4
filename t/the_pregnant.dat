5|$|Although his {{prestige}} {{was on the}} rise, Rosas made {{no serious}} attempts to further liberalise his regime.

Desperate to stay alive, Gothel steals the baby from the palace and she imprisoned her in a secluded tower for eighteen years, raising the child as her own and prohibiting her from leaving solely in order to use her hair to stay young.|$|E
5|$|Not {{knowing that}} Henry VIII had already {{secretly}} married <b>the</b> <b>pregnant</b> Anne Boleyn, Clement VII decided {{to reach out}} to the monarch by appointing Thomas Cranmer, an outspoken proponent of Henry VIII's annulment, as archbishop of Canterbury.

Henry VIII then claimed the authority to act on behalf of Campeggio in making various ecclesiastical appointments. The fifth session of the Reformation Parliament deprived Campeggio and Girolamo Ghinucci of their English sees (unless they swore loyalty to the king). Unaware of this statute, two days later on 23 March 1534 Campeggio entered Consistory for the final ruling against annulment.|$|E

The fisherman presented the children to the king, who kept the male child. The boy grew up to become King Matsya, the founder of the Matsya Kingdom. The king gave the female child back to the fisherman, naming her Matsya-gandha ("She who smells like fish"). The fisherman raised the girl as his daughter and named her Kali ("the dark one") because of her complexion. Over the course of time, Kali earned the name Satyavati ("truthful"). The fisherman was also a ferryman, ferrying people across the river in his boat. Satyavati helped her father, the fisherman, in his job and grew up into a beautiful maiden.|$|E
5|$|Before long, Darnley grew arrogant. Not {{content with}} his {{position}} as king consort, he demanded the Crown Matrimonial, which would have made him a co-sovereign of Scotland {{with the right to}} keep the Scottish throne for himself if he outlived his wife. Mary refused his request, and their marriage grew strained even though they conceived by October 1565. He was jealous of her friendship with her Catholic private secretary, David Rizzio, who was rumoured to be the father of her child. By March 1566, Darnley had entered into a secret conspiracy with Protestant lords, including the nobles who had rebelled against Mary in the Chaseabout Raid. On 9 March, a group of the conspirators, accompanied by Darnley, murdered Rizzio in front of <b>the</b> <b>pregnant</b> Mary at a dinner party in Holyrood Palace. Over the next two days, a disillusioned Darnley switched sides, and Mary received Moray at Holyrood. On the night of 11–12 March, Darnley and Mary escaped from the palace, and took temporary refuge in Dunbar Castle before returning to Edinburgh on 18March. The former rebels Lords Moray, Argyll and Glencairn were restored to the council.|$|E

Kwai gives her a stack of money and ask her to take care of Costello. Kwai's syndicate return to Macau because they lost contact with Kwai's cousin Tony who supplies their ammunition.

His subordinates help him run away from Costello, who gives chase on foot. As Costello walks, he checks the bystanders for stickers, which tips Fung off to the fact that Costello does not actually recognize him, apart from the stickers he is wearing. Fung removes the stickers from his coat, and puts them on the jacket of a subordinate instead. This causes Costello to shoot Fung's subordinate.

40|$|Depletion of GLUT 4, {{the primary}} glucose {{transporter}} protein in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, {{is reported to}} contribute to insulin resistance in pregnancy or diabetes. To examine this phenomenon, the expression of GLUT 4 protein was assessed by Western blotting in streptozotocin-induced diabetic pregnant rats. In adipose tissue, relative to control, it was decreased by 30 % in <b>the</b> normal <b>pregnant</b> group (p< 0. 001), by 37 % in the diabetic nonpregnant group (p< 0. 01) and by 65 % in <b>the</b> diabetic <b>pregnant</b> group (p< 0. 001). On the other hand, no significant variation was evident among the groups in skeletal muscle. To assess the mechanisms responsible for depletion of GLUT 4 protein in adipose tissue, we quantitated levels of GLUT 4 mRNA with a RNase protection assay. It was decreased by 44 % in <b>the</b> normal <b>pregnant</b> group (p< 0. 05) and by 55 % in <b>the</b> diabetic <b>pregnant</b> group (p< 0. 05), but not altered in the diabetic nonpregnant group.
