The constraint of remaining above {{the surface of the}} planet introduces a maximum natural <b>turn</b> <b>angle.</b> This divides the problem naively into two categories. The first is the case when the <b>turn</b> <b>angle</b> required by the given asymptotes is {{less than or equal to}} the maximum natural <b>turn</b> <b>angle.</b> This is the more reasonable situation for a swingby maneuver, and is the case considered in this paper. The resulting optimal transfers are of five basic types. In boundary conditions space, by far the largest area of transfers are either single impulse transfers or transfers through the parabolic level requiring two finite impulses. In no case has an optimal transfer been found which uses more than two finite impulses and three infinitesimal impulses.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{design and}} {{analysis}} of omnidirectional single feed circularly polarized, wide axial ratio beamwidth resonant side-fed bifilar helix antennas {{that do not require}} a ground plane is presented. The simulation and measurement results show that side-fed helix antennas of various radii gives near perfect circular polarization (CP) almost over the whole sphere except at and around nulls, at a certain <b>turn</b> <b>angle</b> by properly proportioning the area of loop (A) with the product of pitch (ρ) and radianlength (l) of helix. Helix antennas with smaller radii give axial ratio (AR) close to one at higher values of <b>turn</b> <b>angle</b> with lower value of resonant input impedances but CP is less sensitive to inaccuracy in <b>turn</b> <b>angle.</b> However helix antennas with larger radii results in AR close to one at lower values of <b>turn</b> <b>angle</b> and provides better values of input resistance but its AR is more sensitive to variations in <b>turn</b> <b>angle.</b> The simulated results show that the polarization solid angle beamwidth (for AR ≤ 3 dB) varies from 3. 96 pi to 4 pi steradian. The gain and 3 dB beamwidth of the antennas are 2 dBi and 90 ◦ respectively. The polarization bandwidth varies from 34 % to 65 %. The simulated results are verified by experimental measurements. 1...|$|R

40|$|Summary In this study, we {{examined}} the collision avoidance behavior of the frog, Rana catesbeiana to an approaching object in the upper visual field. The angular velocity of the frog's escape turn showed a significant positive correlation with the <b>turn</b> <b>angle</b> (r 2  =  0. 5741, P 0. 05). Thus, the frog {{was not able to}} control the velocity of the large escape turns accurately and did not complete the behavior within a constant time. In the latter case, there was a small but significant positive correlation between the threshold angular size and the angular velocity (r 2  =  0. 1459, P< 0. 05). This suggests that the threshold is controlled to compensate for the insufficient escape velocity achieved during large <b>turn</b> <b>angles,</b> and could explain a significant negative correlation between the <b>turn</b> <b>angle</b> and the threshold angular size (r 2  =  0. 1145, P< 0. 05). Thus, {{it is likely that the}} threshold angular size is also controlled by the <b>turn</b> <b>angle</b> and is modulated by motor planning...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} for wearable devices to identify driving activities and unsafe driving, without re-lying on information or sensors in the vehicle.

Identifying steering wheel usage helps mobile device detect driving and reduce distractions. Tracking steering wheel <b>turning</b> <b>angles</b> can improve vehicle motion tracking by mobile devices and help identify unsafe driving. The approach relies on motion features that allow distinguishing steering from other confounding hand move-ments. Once steering wheel usage is detected, it also use wrist rotation measurements to infer steering wheel <b>turning</b> <b>angles.</b> Our preliminary experiments show that the tech-nique is 98. 9 % accurate in detecting driving and can esti-mate <b>turning</b> <b>angles</b> with average error within two degrees...|$|R
40|$|During {{walking the}} {{behavior}} of the head and trunk are closely coupled. This becomes particularly clear while taking a turn. Here, we investigate this coupling during two phases of turning, before and during. Before a turn people make anticipatory orientations of the head into the direction of the turn. Previous research suggests that this anticipation occurs at a constant distance before the curve for different walking speeds. However, in most studies participants only performed 90 turns. We tested whether anticipation distance is invariant across different <b>turn</b> <b>angles.</b> As the <b>turn</b> progresses the head continues to look further into the turn than the trunk, and slowly converging towards the end of turn. An additional question here is the dependence of relative yaw between head and trunk on the <b>turn</b> <b>angle.</b> To answer these questions we measured head-trunk angles across a range of different <b>turn</b> <b>angles.</b> Participants followed predefined paths around obstacles with the radius of turn indicated by circles drawn on the floor. <b>Turning</b> <b>angles</b> ranged from 45 to 180 in steps of 45. The position and orientation of both the head and trunk were measured using an optical tracking system. Two parameters were calculated from the data: head anticipation and maximum relative yaw. Head anticipation is the distance in space where the head starts to look into the upcoming turn. Maximum relative yaw is the maximum difference occurring between the yaw angle of the head and the trunk during a turn. Both head anticipation and maximum relative yaw increased with <b>turn</b> <b>angle,</b> although maximum relative yaw leveled off after 135. In a second experiment, participants followed the same paths as in Experiment 1, but were not constrained in the turn radius. Results showed that turn radius decreased with increasing <b>turn</b> <b>angle.</b> Nevertheless, we found the same pattern of results as in Experiment 1. In conclusion, the relation between head and trunk both before and during a turn is dependent on the <b>angle</b> of <b>turn</b> one is about to make...|$|R

40|$|Walking along {{a curved}} path {{requires}} coordinated motor {{actions of the}} entire body. Here, we investigate the relationship between head and trunk movements during walking. Previous {{studies have found that}} the head systematically turns into turns before the trunk does. This has been found to occur at a constant distance rather than at a constant time before a turn. We tested whether this anticipatory head behavior is spatially invariant for <b>turns</b> of different <b>angles.</b> Head and trunk positions and orientations were measured while participants walked around obstacles in 45 °, 90 °, 135 ° or 180 ° turns. The radius of the turns was either imposed or left free.

During turns, the head was consistently oriented more into the direction of the turn than the trunk. This difference increased for larger <b>turning</b> <b>angles</b> and reached its maximum later in the turn for larger turns.
