6000|$|He {{spoke of}} the value of all he read into it, into the mere sight of the walls, mere shapes of the rooms, mere sound of the floors, mere feel, in his hand, of the old {{silver-plated}} knobs of the several mahogany doors, which suggested the pressure of the palms of the dead the seventy years of the past in fine that these things represented, the annals of nearly three generations, counting his grandfather's, the one that had ended there, and the impalpable ashes of his long-extinct youth, afloat in the very air like microscopic motes. She listened to everything; she was a woman who answered intimately but who utterly didn't chatter.

50|$|The distinctions at work {{in these}} types of definition: between active and inactive/inert, {{specific}} and non-specific, and subjective and objective, have been problematized. For instance, if placebos are inactive or inert, <b>then</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> they cause placebo effects? More generally, there is scientific evidence from research investigating placebo phenomena which demonstrates that, for certain conditions (such as pain), placebo effects can be both specific and objective in the conventional sense.|$|E
5000|$|For {{many centuries}} the peritrope was used {{primarily}} {{as a tool for}} refuting global skepticism. Skepticism proposes that Truth is unknowable, which can be challenged by responding with the peritrope — the question, Well, <b>then,</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> you know that to be true? Skepticism and similar views are considered to be [...] "self-refuting." [...] In other words, a philosopher has retained what he has disavowed in and by the disavowal itself. In general, versions of the Peritrope can be used to challenge many kinds of assertion that universality is impossible.|$|E
50|$|Implicit {{learning}} {{starts in}} our early childhood, {{this means that}} people are not able to learn the proper grammar and rules to speaking a language until the age of seven. So {{if this is the case}} <b>then</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> we learn to talk by the age of four? One of the ways that this is possible is through implicit learning and association. Children learn their first language from what they hear when they are listening to the adults and through their own talking activities. This goes to show that the way children learn language involves implicit learning.|$|E

5000|$|Opponents of {{the bill}} believe that by raising the age the {{legislature}} is giving children two additional years to commit crimes knowing {{they would not be}} charged in an adult court, suggesting that the proposed law would not provide any deterrence. Eddie Caldwell provides a valid defense against the proposed legislation and proves to be the leading contestant against House Bill 632. In addition to monetary costs that are associated with the legislation, Caldwell argues various other reasons as to why the legislation is disorganized. Caldwell argues that advocates are not addressing a major concern in which he states, [...] "if its a kid that's done something wrong - as we all have - some worse than others, for the first time, <b>then</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> you deal with the child as opposed to the one that you've dealt with 100 times before?" [...] He also states, [...] "Currently we allow that age group {{to decide whether or not}} they want to drop out of school, and that decision is no less important to the future of that child, and no less critical to their success than whether or not they commit a crime." [...] While taking a critical stance against the proposed policy, Caldwell [...] "says the Sheriff's Association is in favor of allotting the Department of Juvenile Justice with the proper resources for its current overall workload." ...|$|E
5000|$|It is {{said that}} once a scholar came in where al-Hadi {{had a meeting with}} masters of Hashemite (a clan Muhammad, the prophet had belonged to). Al-Hadi seated the scholar beside himself and treated him with great respect. The Hashemite protested saying: [...] "why do you prefer him to the masters of Banu Hashim?’Al-Hadi said: [...] "Beware to be from those whom God has said about, Have you not {{considered}} those who are given a portion of the Book? They are invited to the Book of God that it mightdecide between them, then a part of them turn back and they withdraw.Do you accept the Book of God as a judge?" [...] asked al-Hadi. They all said, [...] "O son of the messenger of God, we do." [...] Then al-Hadi tried to prove his stance by saying, [...] "Has God not said God will exalt those of you who believe, and those who are given knowledge, in high degrees?God does not accept for a knowledgeable believer but to be preferred to an unknowledgeable believer, just as He wants a believer to be preferred to an unbeliever. God has said, God will exalt those of you who believe and those who are given knowledge, in high degrees. Has He said, God will exalt those, who are given honor of lineage, in high degrees?

50|$|This {{position}} has {{led him to}} face the following problem: if time {{is not part of}} the fundamental theory of the world, <b>then</b> <b>how</b> <b>does</b> time emerge? In 1993, in collaboration with Alain Connes, Rovelli has proposed a solution to this problem called the thermal time hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, time emerges only in a thermodynamic or statistical context. If this is correct, the flow of time is an illusion, one deriving from the incompleteness of knowledge.|$|R

This article looks at how Taiwan’s ruling parties have constructed Taiwanese culture and identity since the lifting of martial law.

By Grand Strategy I mean the employment of all instruments of power (e. g. diplomatic, informational, military, and economic) available for the furtherance of its security and national interests. Security and national interests include both foreign and domestic. I contend that the designers of a nation’s grand strategy ought to include representatives of the major political parties, civilian leaders {{in the areas of}} the Foreign Service, public affairs, and economic matters, as well as the Ministry of Defense.
