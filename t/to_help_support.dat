Postmen lose a day's pay for each day they strike, and although most workers had lost just two days pay so far, many in the London area who had taken part in previous industrial action earlier in the year had lost as much as 18 days of wages. There was also speculation that the CWU lacked the funds for a lengthy dispute and donations to the union's fighting fund were pledged by other unions, including UNISON and Unite.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Murphy was a loner with {{mood swings}} and an {{explosive}} temper. He {{grew up in}} Texas, around Farmersville, Greenville, and Celeste, where he attended elementary school.

Hunt County authorities placed his three youngest siblings in Boles Children's Home, a Christian orphanage in Quinlan. After the war, he bought a house in Farmersville for his oldest sister Corinne and her husband Poland Burns. His other siblings briefly shared the home.|$|E
5|$|In 1619, King James I {{decreed that}} the American colonists of Jamestown {{would need to}} step up efforts to do their fair share towards {{supporting}} England. The Virginia Company enacted the decree, asking Jamestown's land owners to grow and export 100 hemp plants <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>support</b> England's cause. Later the colonists would grow it to support its expansion in the Americas. George Washington grew hemp at Mount Vernon {{as one of his}} three primary crops. The use of hemp for rope and fabric later became ubiquitous throughout the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States. Medicinal preparations of cannabis became available in American pharmacies in the 1850s following an introduction to its use in Western medicine by William O'Shaughnessy a decade earlier in 1839.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1949 Higginbotham entered Yale Law School. As he had in grade school, he worked, this time as a butcher, <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>support</b> himself while at Yale. He {{was a member of}} the moot court team and the Barrister's Union (a mock trial organization). Higginbotham {{advanced}} to the finals of the first year moot court competition. He argued before a panel that included Justice Clark of the Supreme Court of the United States, and renowned appellate advocate John W. Davis, who would later argue against Thurgood Marshall on behalf of the State of Kansas in Brown v. Board of Education. In 1951, Higginbotham competed on a moot court team with Richard N. Gardner, who would later serve as United States Ambassador to Spain and the United States Ambassador to Italy. Higginbotham's team argued against a team from Temple University Law School, which included his future law partner and judicial colleague, Clifford Scott Green.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} {{stationary}} weather ship was proposed as early as 1921 by Météo-France <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>support</b> shipping and the coming of transatlantic aviation. They were used during World War II but had no means of defense, {{which led to the}} loss of several ships and many lives. On the whole, the establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during World War II for Europe and North America that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established a global network of weather ships in 1948, with 13 to be supplied by Canada, the United States, and Europe. This number was eventually negotiated down to nine. The agreement of the use of weather ships by the international community ended in 1985.|$|E
