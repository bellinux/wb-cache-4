40|$|Ion chromatographic (IC) methods using sodium {{hydroxide}} and methanol gradients {{were used for}} the determination of small inorganic and organic anions as decomposition products of a <b>tecnazene</b> solution in water irradiated by UV light. After 60 min of UV irradiation, > 99 % of the <b>tecnazene</b> was decomposed, and 11 organic and 3 inorganic anions were identified and quantified. A fourth inorganic anion, carbonate, was not quantified due to likely losses as carbon dioxide. The final content of chloride, total nitrogen, and total carbon released from the saturated <b>tecnazene</b> solution after 60 min of UV irradiation were 108, 85, and 38 %, respectively. These results suggest that other products rich in carbon and/or nitrogen (such as phenolic compounds and nitrobenzenes) were formed during the UV irradiation of the <b>tecnazene</b> solution. The results obtained indicate several decomposition pathways of <b>tecnazene</b> in water solutions, for example, ring opening reactions, dechlorination, and replacement of the ring nitro group. The determination of nonionic decomposition products from the latter two possibilities is the subject of further study...|$|E
40|$|Isocratic liquid chromatographic methods with {{mobile phases}} {{consisting}} of 20 mmol l- 1 sulfuric acid and 60 % acetonitrile (for 9 quickly eluted nitroaromatic compounds) or 75 % acetonitrile (for 2 strongly retained nitrobenzenes) at a flow rate of 1. 2 ml min- 1 using a DC amperometric detection with a glassy carbon working electrode at - 0. 5 V vs Ag/AgCl reference electrode {{have been developed}} for the determination of 11 nitroaromatic compounds. The overall repeatability of the retention times was better than 0. 5 % and the repeatability of the peak areas ranged from 1. 2 to 8. 3 % (n = 7) based on the manual injection of 300 μl of standard solution. Limits of detection (LODs for 3. S/N) of 25 - 250 nmol l- 1 were obtained. The developed methods have been applied to the determination of nitroaromatic decomposition products in the UV-irradiated samples of a <b>tecnazene</b> (1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrachloro- 3 -nitrobenzene) solution. Due to the high selectivity of the DC amperometric detection in reductive mode, no interferences occurred in the analyses of UV-irradiated <b>tecnazene</b> solutions although high concentrations of other compounds (e. g., phenols, chlorophenols, inorganic anions, and carboxylic acids) were present...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolic}} fate of U- 14 C- 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrachloronitrobenzene (<b>tecnazene)</b> {{has been determined}} in {{the male and female}} rat following a single dose of 1 mg/kg and in surgically prepared, bile-duct-cannulated rats following a single oral dose of 135 mg/kg. Radioactivity in the female rat was excreted mainly in urine (82 %). The male rat, however, excreted approximately equal amounts of radioactivity in urine and faeces (the latter via bile). The principal metabolic pathway was conjugation with glutathione (GSH) and concomitant nitro-displacement. The GSH-conjugate and related metabolites were excreted in the bile and ultimately in the urine as the mercapturic acid conjugate. The cysteine conjugate underwent Î²-lyase-mediated metabolism to yield a thiol that underwent subsequent methylation to the thioanisole followed by S-oxidation. A novel tetrachloromethyldisulphide metabolite was also formed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{evaluation}} of the stability of pesticides in fruits and vegetables during cryogenic sample processing (comminution of samples {{in the presence of}} dry ice) is reported. Pesticides were spiked onto the undamaged surface of individual units of fruit before freezing and comminution. The mean recoveries of pesticides spiked before and after comminution of the sample were compared to determine the relative stability of the individual pesticides during cryogenic sample processing. A stable internal deposition standard (IDS) was used to correct for physical losses and volumetric errors. Mean recovery results together with associated standard errors were obtained using Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) analysis. A total of 134 pesticides in 4 commodities (apples, grapes, lettuce and oranges) were evaluated. The results demonstrated that 120 pesticides were stable (i. e. the mean difference in recovery of pesticides spiked pre and post processing was 20 %); biphenyl, cadusafos, captan, chlorothalonil, dichlorvos, disulfoton, ethoxyquin, etradiazole, heptenophos, malaoxon, phorate, tebuconazole, <b>tecnazene</b> and trifluralin...|$|E
40|$|An on-line preconcentration {{technique}} {{based on}} 5 ml sample or standard solution injection onto a preconcentration column {{has been developed}} for the ion chromatographic (IC) determination of 14 chlorophenolic and phenolic compounds at the picomolar levels. A suitable gradient program using 10 mM sulphuric acid and variable concentrations of acetonitrile (36 – 65 % (v/v), details given) was applied at the constant flow rate of 1. 0 ml min− 1. For the detection of 14 phenolic compounds, dc amperometric detection with a glassy carbon working electrode at the potential of + 1. 2 V versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode was used. The overall repeatability (n= 5) for retention times was better than 0. 6 % and the repeatability (n= 5) for the peak areas ranged from 0. 5 % (resorcinol) to 3. 2 % (3, 5 -dichlorophenol) at 50 – 250 nM concentration levels. LODs (3 S/N) of 200 – 500 pM except for 2, 6 - and 3, 5 -dichlorophenol and 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrachlorophenol (1, 5 and 1 nM, respectively) were obtained. The method {{has been applied to}} determine some of the decomposition products of UV-irradiated fungicide <b>tecnazene</b> (1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrachloro- 3 -nitrobenzene) solution and phenolic pollutants in drinking water. Due to the high selectivity of the amperometric detection, the only compounds that can be determined are the ones that can be oxidised and therefore possible interferences (e. g. from nitro-compounds) are bypassed...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} separation {{methods have}} been used for the determination of small inorganic anions in water samples and the results of developed CE and IC {{methods have been}} compared. Using the CE method, baseline separation of common inorganic anions including nitrite and nitrate up to the concentrations of 100 mg/l was achieved in about 5 minutes. The electrolyte consisted of 3 mM K 2 CrO 4, 30 M CTAB and 3 mM H 3 BO 3 at pH 8. 0. The method yielded precision of 1. 8 - 7. 2 % (RSD, n = 10) for peak area and limits of detection from 4 g/l up to 500 g/l were achieved. For the IC method, gradient program (details given) for the determination of inorganic anions was optimised and the full baseline separation of six common inorganic anions was achieved in less than 15 minutes. The overall repeatability for peak areas was in the range from 0. 1 - 0. 5 % (RSD, n = 7) and limits of detection from 4 g/l up to 25 mg/l were achieved. From the results obtained, it was concluded that CE should be preferred in applications where short analysis time, little waste production and accurate determination of carbonate is needed. Conversely, IC should be preferably used in applications where especially high sensitivity and precision for the determination of inorganic anions is required (e. g. trace analyses). For the simultaneous determination of organic and inorganic anions in water samples, IC methods have been developed. The method programs were partly isocratic and partly gradient (details given) and the full baseline separation of 23 or 15 common inorganic and organic anions was achieved in less than 19 or 27 minutes, respectively. In the next part of this thesis, the method for the simultaneous determination of small anions and cations by CE was developed. In the developed method, metal cations in the sample are transformed into their chelates with EDTA and are separated together with the anions using an anionic separation mode. Simultaneous separation of 19 common anions and cations was achieved in about 6 minutes with the electrolyte containing 5 mM K 2 CrO 4, 3 mM boric acid, 35 mM CTAB and 12 mM EDTA at pH 8. Limits of detection (3 S/N) were in the range from 4 ppb up to 1250 ppb and RSD of peak areas (n = 7) ranged from 1. 4 % up to 8. 5 %. The practical applicability of all CE and IC methods was demonstrated on the analysis of anions and cations in various water samples. In the part of the thesis concerning small organic molecules, two ion chromatographic (IC) methods (details given) at the constant flow rate of 1. 2 ml/min using electrochemical (EC) detection were developed for the determination of 11 nitroaromatic compounds. The overall repeatability of the retention times was better than 0. 5 % and the repeatability of the peak areas ranged from 1. 2 % to 8. 3 % (RSD, n = 5). Limits of detection (3 S/N) of 25 - 250 nM were obtained. Last part of this thesis was aimed at the development of a very sensitive on-line preconcentration IC-EC method for the determination of chlorophenolic and phenolic pollutants in environmental samples. A suitable gradient program (details given) was applied at the constant flow rate of 1. 0 ml/min. The overall repeatability (n = 5) for retention times was better than 0. 6 % and the repeatability (n = 5) for the peak areas ranged from 0. 5 % up to 3. 2 % at 50 - 250 nM concentration level. Limits of detection (3 S/N) of 0. 2 - 5. 0 nM were obtained. All IC-EC methods were practically applied to the determination of organic pollutants in drinking water samples and organic decomposition products in the UV-irradiated samples of a fungicide <b>tecnazene</b> solution.
