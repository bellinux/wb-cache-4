5|$|Anthony Taylor was {{the referee}} for the final. It {{was his first}} match {{involving}} Chelsea since December 2014, when he erroneously booked Cesc Fàbregas for diving {{when he had been}} fouled by Southampton's Matt Targett; Taylor apologised to Chelsea for <b>that</b> <b>decision.</b>|$|E
5|$|During this process, the Home Office {{declined}} to give Bamber the expert evidence it had obtained, so Bamber applied for judicial review of <b>that</b> <b>decision</b> in November 1994; this resulted in the Home Office handing over its expert evidence. In 1996, without informing Bamber or his lawyers, an Essex police officer destroyed many of the trial exhibits. He {{said he had not}} been aware that the case was ongoing.|$|E
5|$|He {{moved to}} {{university}} preparatory New Hampton School after that season, reclassifying {{to the class}} of 2012. He cited his desire to get academically and physically ready for college as the main factors behind <b>that</b> <b>decision.</b>|$|E

5|$|However <b>that</b> <b>decision</b> proved controversial. The Bishops' Council {{formally}} {{objected to}} the Commissioners' decision, and the matter was referred by the Archbishops' Council to a committee which, in May 2014, decided that the house in Croscombe was not suitable to be a see house, and that the bishop should remain living in the Palace.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, the Interstate Commerce Commission {{agreed with}} the city after it filed a {{complaint}} about these practices, but <b>that</b> <b>decision</b> was struck down by a federal court. In 1906, Spokane sued under the newly passed Hepburn Act, and won on July 24, 1911.|$|E
5|$|Near 4:00 PM, with {{fourteen}} batteries {{destroyed and}} an hour left until dark, Ivry decided to call off the operation, assuming the optimal result had been achieved and that the Syrians would move more SAMs into place the next day. The operation was stopped shortly after 4:00 PM. Colonel Aviem Sella, {{a member of the}} operation staff, later said that Sharon severely criticized <b>that</b> <b>decision.</b>|$|E

5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Federation {{starship}} Enterprise. In this episode, an injured Borg drone (Jonathan Del Arco) is found amid a crashed scout ship. As they restore him to health, the crew must {{decide whether or not to}} develop him as a weapon of mass destruction against the Borg, but when he demonstrates free will, they must question <b>that</b> <b>decision.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stevenson opposed {{almost every}} effort to expand blacks' rights beyond the {{minimums}} assured by federal amendments and legislation. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 guaranteed that blacks could testify against whites in federal courts, but he opposed New Departure Democrats when they insisted that Kentucky amend its laws to also allow black testimony against whites in state courts, and the measure failed in the 1867 legislative session. Later that year, the Kentucky Court of Appeals declared the Civil Rights Act unconstitutional, but a federal court soon overturned <b>that</b> <b>decision.</b> Stevenson backed Bourbon Democrats' appeal of <b>that</b> <b>decision</b> to the Supreme Court of the United States. By 1871, however, he had {{changed his mind and}} supported blacks' right to testify. Despite Stevenson's support, the measure failed in the General Assembly again in 1871, but it passed the following year, after Stevenson had left office.|$|E
5|$|The International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) {{initially}} {{decided to}} not abide by the LMP2 restrictor change for the American Le Mans Series, although <b>that</b> <b>decision</b> was reversed following Le Mans.

5|$|After the Polish {{units were}} {{defeated}} by the Russians at Šiauliai, Gen. Chłapowski decided {{to cross the border}} into Prussia and become interned there. Plater vocally criticized <b>that</b> <b>decision,</b> refused to follow orders and instead decided to try to break through to Warsaw and continue the struggle. However, soon after separating from the main force, accompanied by only two others, including her cousin (or uncle, sources vary), Cezary Plater, she became seriously ill. She never recovered, and she died in a manor of the Abłamowicz family in Justinavas on 23 December 1831. She was buried in the small village of Kapčiamiestis near Lazdijai. After the defeat of the uprising, her estate was confiscated by the Russian authorities.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained that the benefits of the program were outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering {{the fact that most of}} the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding <b>that</b> <b>decision.</b>|$|E

5|$|As a {{condition}} of being allowed to disinter the skeleton, the archaeologists agreed that, if Richard were found, his remains would be reburied in Leicester Cathedral. A controversy arose as to whether an alternative reburial site, York Minster or Westminster Abbey, would be more suitable. A legal challenge confirmed there were no public law grounds for the courts {{to be involved in}} <b>that</b> <b>decision.</b> Reinterment took place in Leicester on 26 March 2015, during a televised memorial service held {{in the presence of the}} Archbishop of Canterbury and senior members of other Christian denominations.|$|E
5|$|Chng Suan Tze was {{followed}} by amendments by Parliament to the Constitution and the ISA in 1989 which purported to return the applicable law regarding judicial review of government discretion under the ISA to that in Lee Mau Seng. The legality of these changes was challenged in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1990). In <b>that</b> <b>decision,</b> the Court of Appeal affirmed that the legislative amendments to the Act were plain and unambiguous, and thus validly established that the subjective test of judicial review now applied to internal security matters.|$|E
5|$|Clark's ruling drew a {{resolution}} of condemnation from the Kentucky General Assembly. He was summoned {{to appear before the}} legislature, but opted to respond to their charges in writing instead. Incensed, the legislature attempted to removed him from office, but the vote of 5935 fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. In October 1823, Clark's decision was upheld by the Kentucky Court of Appeals; <b>that</b> <b>decision</b> touched off the Old Court-New Court controversy, wherein the legislature attempted to abolish the Court of Appeals {{and replace it with a}} more sympathetic court.|$|E

5|$|Compromise {{having been}} exhausted, both sides agreed to litigate the matter. The Kentucky Court of Appeals {{found that the}} General Assembly had acted legally in declaring Goebel {{the winner of the}} election. <b>That</b> <b>decision</b> was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Arguments were {{presented}} in the case (Taylor v. Beckham) on April 30, 1900, and on May 21, the justices decided 8–1 not to hear the case, allowing the Court of Appeals' decision to stand. The lone dissension was that of Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan, a Kentucky native. and member of the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Following the mistrial in Boston, the {{prosecution}} moved {{to schedule a}} new trial. LaRouche and the other defendants appealed that effort on October 5, 1988, saying that a new trial would create double jeopardy. The appeal was denied four months later. The contempt of court fines were appealed again on January 9, 1989, and affirmed again on March 29. Following the convictions in the Alexandria court, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charges from the Boston court, canceling the retrial. The LaRouche lawyers appealed <b>that</b> <b>decision</b> on March 13, 1989, arguing that they needed the trial to exonerate LaRouche.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Bamber lost a High Court appeal {{against the}} whole-life tariff before Mr. Justice Tugendhat. This was {{upheld by the}} Court of Appeal in 2009. Bamber and three other British whole-life prisoners appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, but the appeal was {{rejected}} in 2012. Bamber and two prisoners, Douglas Vinter and Peter Moore, appealed <b>that</b> <b>decision</b> too, and in 2013 the European Court's Grand Chamber ruled that keeping the prisoners in jail with no prospect of release or review may not be compatible with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{responses}} to the uncertainties of global warming is to adopt a strategy of sequential decision making.

Governments might choose to use risk management as part of their policy response to global warming. For instance, a risk-based approach can be applied to climate impacts which are difficult to quantify in economic terms, e.g., the impacts of global warming on indigenous peoples.|$|R
