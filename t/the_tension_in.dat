5|$|In 1962, Ray {{directed}} Kanchenjungha. Based on {{his first}} original screenplay, {{it was his first}} film in colour. The film tells of an upper-class family spending an afternoon in Darjeeling, a picturesque hill town in West Bengal. They try to arrange the engagement of their youngest daughter to a highly paid engineer educated in London. He had first conceived shooting the film in a large mansion, but later decided to film it in the famous hill town. He used the many shades of light and mist to reflect <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> the drama. Ray noted that while his script allowed shooting to be possible under any lighting conditions, a commercial film contingent present {{at the same time in}} Darjeeling failed to shoot a single scene, as they only wanted to do so in sunshine.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Clairmont {{became a}} lover of the Romantic poet Lord Byron, and Mary Godwin and Shelley had a second child on 24 January 1816, who was named William after Godwin. In February, Imlay went to visit the Shelleys, who had settled in Bishopsgate. Godwin's debts {{continued}} to mount, and while he demanded money from Shelley, Godwin still refused to see either him or his daughter. At this time, Charles Clairmont (Imlay's step-brother), frustrated with <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> the Godwin household, left for France and refused to help the family any further. At around the same time, Claire Clairmont, Mary Godwin, and Shelley left for the Continent, seeking Byron. Godwin was aghast. He relied on Shelley's money, and the stain on his family's reputation only increased when the public learned that the group had left to join the rakish Byron.|$|E

25|$|Newton {{examined}} {{this problem}} himself using rotating spheres, {{as shown in}} Figure 2 and Figure 3. He pointed out that if the spheres are not rotating, <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> the tying string is measured as zero in every frame of reference. If the spheres only appear to rotate (that is, we are watching stationary spheres from a rotating frame), the zero tension in the string is accounted for by observing that the centripetal force is supplied by the centrifugal and Coriolis forces in combination, so no tension is needed. If the spheres really are rotating, the tension observed is exactly the centripetal force required by the circular motion. Thus, measurement of <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> the string identifies the inertial frame: {{it is the one}} where <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> the string provides exactly the centripetal force demanded by the motion as it is observed in that frame, and not a different value. That is, the inertial frame is the one where the fictitious forces vanish.|$|E

25|$|The {{ultimate}} cause {{leading to}} war was the {{ruling by the}} Massachusetts General Court in 1676 making it illegal to sell firearms, powder, or rounds to the area's tribes.

The French encouraged the Indians to raid the English settlements, due to <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> Europe at the time.|$|E
25|$|A {{classic example}} of fictitious force in {{circular}} motion is the experiment of rotating spheres tied by a cord and spinning around their center of mass. In this case, as with the linearly accelerating car example, the identification of a rotating, non-inertial frame of reference can be based upon the vanishing of fictitious forces. In an inertial frame, fictitious forces are not necessary to explain <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> the string joining the spheres. In a rotating frame, Coriolis and centrifugal forces must be introduced to predict the observed tension.|$|E

25|$|Some steel arch bridges (such as the Navajo Bridge) {{are built}} using pure {{cantilever}} spans from each side, with neither falsework below nor temporary supporting towers and cables above. These are then joined with a pin, usually after forcing the union point apart, and when jacks are removed and the bridge decking is added the bridge becomes a truss arch bridge. Such unsupported construction is only possible where appropriate rock {{is available to}} support <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> the upper chord of the span during construction, usually limiting this method to the spanning of narrow canyons.|$|E
25|$|Topoisomerase inhibitors are {{drugs that}} affect the {{activity}} of two enzymes: topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II. When the DNA double-strand helix is unwound, during DNA replication or transcription, for example, the adjacent unopened DNA winds tighter (supercoils), like opening {{the middle of a}} twisted rope. The stress caused by this effect is in part aided by the topoisomerase enzymes. They produce single- or double-strand breaks into DNA, reducing <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> the DNA strand. This allows the normal unwinding of DNA to occur during replication or transcription. Inhibition of topoisomerase I or II interferes with both of these processes.|$|E
25|$|By {{determining}} an object's {{acceleration and}} integrating over time, {{the velocity of}} the object can be calculated. Integrating again, position can be determined. The simplest accelerometer is a weight that is free to move horizontally, which {{is attached to a}} spring and a device to measure <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> the spring. This can be improved by introducing a counteracting force to push the weight back and to measure the force needed to prevent the weight from moving. A more complicated design consists of a gyroscope with a weight on one of the axes. The device will react to the force generated by the weight when it is accelerated, by integrating that force to produce a velocity.|$|E

25|$|In {{suspension}} bridges, large main cables (normally two) hang {{between the}} towers and are anchored {{at each end}} to the ground. This {{can be difficult to}} implement when ground conditions are poor. The main cables, which are free to move on bearings in the towers, bear the load of the bridge deck. Before the deck is installed, the cables are under tension from their own weight. Along the main cables smaller cables or rods connect to the bridge deck, which is lifted in sections. As this is done, <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> the cables increases, as it does with the live load of traffic crossing the bridge. The tension on the main cables is transferred to the ground at the anchorages and by downwards tug on the towers.|$|E
25|$|For the {{treatment}} of trauma patients every minute counts. Patients with severe bleedings after car accidents, explosions, gunshot wounds or aortic dissections, etc. need immediate care due to the life-threatening blood loss. In a hybrid operating room both open and endovascular treatment of the patient can be performed. For example, <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> the brain due to a severe haemorrhage can be relieved and the aneurysm can be coiled. The concept of placing the emergency patient on an operating table as soon as he/she enters the hospital, if stable perform a trauma scan in the CT or if instable immediate procedure in the hybrid operating room without having to reposition the patient can save valuable time and reduce risk of further injury.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, timpani were hand-tuned; that is, {{there was a}} {{sequence}} of screws with T-shaped handles, called taps, which altered <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> the head when turned by players. Thus, tuning was a relatively slow operation, and composers had to allow {{a reasonable amount of}} time for players to change notes if they were called to tune {{in the middle of a}} work. The first 'machine' timpani, with a single tuning handle, was developed in 1812. The first pedal timpani originated in Dresden in the 1870s and are called Dresden timpani for this reason. However, since vellum was used for the heads of the drums, automated solutions were difficult to implement since the tension would vary unpredictably across the drum. This could be compensated for by hand-tuning, but not easily by a pedal drum. Mechanisms continued to improve in the early 20th century.|$|E
