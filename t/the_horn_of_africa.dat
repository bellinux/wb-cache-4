5|$|During the 7th century, Aksumite power {{began to}} fail, and Ethiopian society began to {{withdraw}} {{further into the}} highland hinterlands, with the coastal areas becoming peripheral areas (whereas Adulis on the coast was once the second city of Aksum).

5|$|Archaeological, biogeographical, and {{linguistic}} evidence {{suggest that the}} donkey was first domesticated by nomadic pastoral people in North Africa over 5,000 years ago. The animals were used to help cope with the increased aridity of the Sahara and <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa.</b> Genetic evidence finds that the donkey was domesticated twice based on two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. It also points to a single ancestor, the Nubian wild ass. Attempts to domesticate zebras were largely unsuccessful, though Walter Rothschild trained some to draw a carriage in England.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, {{forestry}} authorities intensified their {{pest control}} methods and additionally started education campaigns, such as warning not to transport firewood over large distances or to store it too long. Through wood export, the wasp can spread to East Asia, West Australia {{and parts of}} Africa. Remote locations, such as <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa,</b> may be spared from the Sirex woodwasp, providing the area is controlled. The Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG) of the IUCN has graded the wasp as heavily invasive.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1975, {{smallpox}} persisted only in <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa.</b> Conditions {{were very}} difficult in Ethiopia and Somalia, where there were few roads. Civil war, famine, and refugees made the task even more difficult. An intensive surveillance and containment and vaccination program was undertaken in these countries in early and mid-1977, {{under the direction of}} Australian microbiologist Frank Fenner. As the campaign neared its goal, Fenner and his team {{played an important role in}} verifying eradication. The last naturally occurring case of indigenous smallpox (Variola minor) was diagnosed in Ali Maow Maalin, a hospital cook in Merca, Somalia, on 26 October 1977. The last naturally occurring case of the more deadly Variola major had been detected in October 1975 in a two-year-old Bangladeshi girl, Rahima Banu.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota {{is known}} for its {{progressive}} political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, a large number of European settlers entered the state who had mainly emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany. The state remains today a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa,</b> the Middle East and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition.

In a {{comparative}} study of seven pastoral systems across West Africa we found that pastoralists have generally successfully adapted to pressures on grazing resources. We describe three adaptive strategies: 1) integration and intensification in the Sudanian zone; 2) movement to the Sub-Humid zone; and 3) extensification in the Sahelian zone.

5|$|The M. {{tuberculosis}} complex (MTBC) {{includes four}} other TB-causing mycobacteria: M. bovis, M. africanum, M. canetti, and M. microti. M. africanum is not widespread, {{but it is}} a significant cause of tuberculosis in parts of Africa. M. bovis was once a common cause of tuberculosis, but the introduction of pasteurized milk has almost completely eliminated this as a public health problem in developed countries. M. canetti is rare and seems to be limited to <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa,</b> although a few cases have been seen in African emigrants. M. microti is also rare and is seen almost only in immunodeficient people, although its prevalence may be significantly underestimated.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed tropicbird has the {{smallest}} {{range of the}} three tropicbird species, yet it still ranges across the neotropics, {{as well as the}} tropical Atlantic, eastern Pacific, and Indian oceans.

It is a vagrant to the coastline of Namibia and South Africa. The subspecies P. a. mesonauta is found in the east Atlantic, the east Pacific, and in the Caribbean. The Indian Ocean subspecies, P. a. indicus is found in waters off Pakistan, western India, southwestern Sri Lanka, <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> and Arabian Peninsula.

5|$|Ethiopian historiographic {{literature}} has been traditionally dominated by Christian {{theology and the}} chronology of the Bible. There was also considerable influence from Muslim, pagan and foreign elements from within <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> and beyond. Diplomatic ties with Christendom were established in the Roman era under Ethiopia's first Christian king, Ezana of Axum, in the 4th century AD, and were renewed in the Late Middle Ages with embassies traveling to and from medieval Europe. Building on the legacy of ancient Greek and Roman historical writings about Ethiopia, medieval European chroniclers made attempts to describe Ethiopia, its people, and religious faith in connection to the mythical Prester John, who {{was viewed as a}} potential ally against Islamic powers. Ethiopian history and its peoples were also mentioned in works of medieval Islamic historiography and even Chinese encyclopedias, travel literature, and official histories.|$|E

5|$|Many coins {{have been}} found in {{northern}} Ethiopia and Eritrea, the central region of Aksum, though Aksumite coins are reported to {{have been found}} in Arato and Lalibela. Many coins have been also found further afield. Numerous hoards of coins (always gold save one silver coin) {{have been found in}} Southern Arabia, much more than in Aksum itself, attesting perhaps to an Aksumite presence in parts of the region (perhaps supporting the use of titles claiming control over parts of South Arabia from GDRT's time). The hoards may be the remnants of hoards left in Kaleb's time (perhaps used to pay soldiers), when it was under an Aksumite governor. Outside of <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> and Arabian Peninsula, coins have been found as far as Israel, Meroe, Egypt, and India. Silver and copper coins are mainly found in Aksum, though some can be traced to Palestinian pilgrim centers.|$|E
5|$|On 3 March 1789, {{he enlisted}} as a {{volunteer}} on the 700-ton Aurore, under Captain Tardivet, a slave ship bound for India. Aurore sailed to Pondicherry and ferried troops bound for Isle de France. On her next journey, seeking to purchase slaves on <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa,</b> Aurore was wrecked in Mozambique Channel, drowning 400 black slaves chained in the orlop. Tardivet chartered the Portugues San Antoine in October 1790 to return to Port-Louis, but had to divert to Sumatra because of the weather, and only returned to Port-Louis in late 1790, on a French ship via the French colony of Pondicherry. Promoted to officer, Surcouf enlisted on the Courrier d'Afrique, another slave ship, bound for Mozambique under Captain Garnier. Captain Tardivet then brought him over as Lieutenant on his new ship, Revanche. On Revanche, Surcouf made several expeditions off Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Over 185 extinct {{members and}} three major {{evolutionary}} radiations {{of the order}} Proboscidea have been recorded. The earliest proboscids, the African Eritherium and Phosphatherium of the late Paleocene, heralded the first radiation. The Eocene included Numidotherium, Moeritherium, and Barytherium from Africa. These animals were relatively small and aquatic. Later on, genera such as Phiomia and Palaeomastodon arose; the latter likely inhabited forests and open woodlands. Proboscidean diversity declined during the Oligocene. One notable species of this epoch was Eritreum melakeghebrekristosi of <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa,</b> {{which may have been}} an ancestor to several later species. The beginning of the Miocene saw the second diversification, with the appearance of the deinotheres and the mammutids. The former were related to Barytherium and lived in Africa and Eurasia, while the latter may have descended from Eritreum and spread to North America.|$|E
