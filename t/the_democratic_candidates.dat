5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} on December 4, 2004, Boustany defeated Mount, 55 percent to 45 percent in an election with low voter turnout. Democrats had hoped on a big turnout, as the district is nearly a quarter African American, a reliable Democratic constituency. Analysis of the race suggested that Mount's defeat was helped by the open primary system that had <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidates</b> work against each other and led to Cravin's conflict with the state Democratic Party which in turn led to suppressed voter turnout. The large number of negative advertisements was also cited as a factor that contributed to low turnout. Another detriment for Mount mentioned was the strong support for George W. Bush {{in the presidential election}} against John Kerry in the district, which he carried by about 60 percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} tumultuous primary {{election}} seasons ever began as the Tet Offensive was launched, followed by the withdrawal of President Johnson as a candidate after doing unexpectedly poorly in the New Hampshire primary; it concluded with the assassination of one of <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidates,</b> Senator Robert F. Kennedy, just moments after his victory in the California primary. On the Republican side, Nixon's main opposition was Michigan Governor George Romney, though New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and California Governor Ronald Reagan each hoped to be nominated in a brokered convention. Nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot. He selected Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew as his running mate, a choice which Nixon believed would unite the party, appealing to both Northern moderates and Southerners disaffected with the Democrats.|$|E
5|$|Early {{polls showed}} that Beshear and Henry led the Democratic field in name recognition, but both trailed Fletcher and his Republican primary rival Anne Northup in that area. Early in the campaign, Beshear {{attempted}} to set himself {{apart from the}} other candidates by supporting a constitutional amendment that would allow expanded casino gambling in the state, which he claimed could generate $500 million in new revenue without the need to raise taxes. Observers noted that this strategy was remarkably {{similar to the one}} used by Wallace Wilkinson who, in his 1987 primary victory over Beshear and others, trumpeted the revenue a state lottery would generate. Initially, all of <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidates</b> except Hensley endorsed a casino amendment, but as Beshear made it the centerpiece of his campaign, support from other candidates began to waver; Richards officially changed his position to oppose the amendment, while several other candidates charged that Beshear was staking too much of his platform on a proposal that was not guaranteed to pass.|$|E

25|$|Four years later, Spitzer again {{wanted to}} run for Attorney General and on May 6, 1998 he {{announced}} he would run for the office for a second time. On May 28, he emerged as the front-runner among <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidates,</b> ranking first at the Democratic convention with 36% of the vote. He also had the most amount of money, with over $2 million. In September, he won the Democratic primary election with 42% of the vote. He defeated State Senator Catherine Abate (27%), Koppell (22%), and former Governor's Counsel Evan Davis (9%). In the general election Spitzer would face the incumbent, Dennis Vacco, a Republican.|$|E
25|$|On a state level, Putnam County has {{generally}} voted for <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidates.</b> In 2004, when Democratic United States Senator Chuck Schumer ran for re-election, he won Putnam County with 58% of the vote, while his Republican opponent, Howard Mills, received only 35%. In 2006, Eliot Spitzer, the Democratic nominee for Governor, won the county with 58% of the vote, and the Republican nominee, John Faso, won 39%. Senator Hillary Clinton, {{running for re-election}} in 2006, also won the county with 51%, defeating John Spencer, the Republican nominee, who won 45% of the vote. In 2010, Andrew Cuomo, the Democratic nominee for Governor, defeated Republican nominee Carl Paladino with 51% of the vote.|$|E

500|$|There was no {{consensus}} among the daily newspapers {{of the state}} regarding <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidates.</b> [...] The state's largest newspaper, the Omaha World-Herald, which then circulated throughout Nebraska, endorsed Harris, noting in particular his opposition to gambling. [...] The Grand Island Independent also endorsed Harris alone. [...] The Lincoln Journal found Harris, Hoppner, and Nelson all worthy candidates. [...] The Lincoln Star and the Fremont Tribune endorsed Hoppner; the Kearney Hub, Boyle; and the North Platte Telegraph, both Boyle and Hoppner.|$|E
500|$|Overall, Biden had {{difficulty}} raising funds, struggled to draw people to his rallies, {{and failed to}} gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton; he never rose above single digits in the national polls of <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidates.</b> In the initial contest on January 3, 2008, Biden placed fifth in the Iowa caucuses, garnering slightly {{less than one percent}} of the state delegates. [...] Biden withdrew from the race that evening, saying [...] "There is nothing sad about tonight.... I feel no regret." ...|$|E
500|$|In Marion, Harding ran his campaign. As a newspaperman himself, he {{fell into}} easy camaraderie with the press {{covering}} him, enjoying a relationship few presidents have equaled. His [...] "Return to Normalcy" [...] theme was aided by the atmosphere that Marion provided, an orderly place that induced nostalgia in many voters. The front porch campaign allowed Harding to avoid mistakes, and as time dwindled towards the election, his strength grew. The travels of <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidates</b> eventually caused Harding to make several short speaking tours, {{but for the most}} part, he remained in Marion. America had no need for another Wilson, Harding argued, appealing for a president [...] "near the normal".|$|E

When <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate,</b> Charles D. Watson, withdrew, the party's state committee substituted Prouty as <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> as well. However, Prouty was defeated by about 7,000 votes.|$|R
500|$|Chambers rose {{quickly in}} the new party's leadership, serving as a {{delegate}} to their state convention in July 1878. [...] Initially a candidate for state land commissioner, Chambers withdrew his name in August of that year to allow former Republican Jacob Kuechler to win a unanimous nomination; he was nominated instead for {{a seat in the}} state legislature. Ten Greenbackers were elected to the legislature that year, but Chambers was not among them. During the campaign, Chambers published a pamphlet attacking <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidates</b> and calling for Congress to create [...] "a sufficient amount of paper money, making it equal to gold and silver, and full legal tender for all debts". While it did not help his own election, the pamphlet was widely circulated within the party and raised Chambers's profile among Greenbackers.|$|E
500|$|Clark {{met with}} a group of wealthy New York Democrats {{including}} Alan Patricof to tell them he was considering running for the presidency in the 2004 election. Patricof, a supporter of Al Gore in 2000, {{met with a}}ll <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidates</b> but supported Clark in 2004. Clark said that he voted for Al Gore and Ronald Reagan, held equal esteem for Dwight D. Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman, and was a registered independent voter throughout his military career. Clark stated that he decided he was a Democrat because [...] "I was pro-affirmative action, I was pro-choice, I was pro-education... I'm pro-health care... I realized I was either going to be the loneliest Republican in America or I {{was going to be a}} happy Democrat." [...] Clark said he liked the Democratic party, which he saw as standing for [...] "internationalism", [...] "ordinary men and women", and [...] "fair play." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a speech}} at the GOP Freedom Summit in April 2014, Paul insisted that the GOP has to broaden its appeal in order to grow as a party. To do so, he said it cannot be the party of [...] "fat cats, rich people and Wall Street" [...] and that the {{conservative}} movement has never been about rich people or privilege, [...] "we are the middle class", he said. Paul also said that conservatives must present a message of justice and concern for the unemployed and be against government surveillance to attract new people to the movement, including the young, Hispanics, and blacks. During the 2014 election, Paul launched a social media campaign titled [...] "Hillary's Losers" [...] which was meant to highlight many of <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidates</b> that lost their bids for the U.S. Senate despite endorsements from Hillary Clinton. Clinton was also a candidate for President and eventually won the Democratic Party's nomination, going on to lose to Donald Trump in the general election.|$|E

500|$|The {{events of}} 1971 changed Gravel {{in the months}} {{following}} from an obscure freshman senator in a far corner of the country to a nationally visible political figure. He became a sought-after speaker on the college circuit as well as at political fundraisers, opportunities he welcomed as lectures were [...] "the one honest way a Senator has to supplement his income." [...] <b>The</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidates</b> for the 1972 presidential election sought out his endorsement. In January 1972 Gravel did endorse Maine Senator Ed Muskie, hoping his endorsement would help Muskie with the party's left wing and in the ethnic French-Canadian areas in first primary state New Hampshire (which Muskie won, but not strongly, and his campaign faltered soon thereafter). In April 1972, Gravel appeared on all three network nightly newscasts to decry the Nixon administration's reliance on Vietnamization by making reference to the secret National Security Study Memorandum 1 document, which stated it would take 8–13 years before the Army of the Republic of Vietnam could defend South Vietnam. Gravel made excerpts from the study public, but his attempt to read NSSM 1 into the Congressional Record was blocked by Senators Robert P. Griffin and William B. Saxbe.|$|E
500|$|As the Wisconsin primary loomed {{in early}} April, Nixon's only {{obstacle}} {{seemed to be}} preventing his supporters from voting in the Democratic primary for Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota as a protest against President Johnson. However, Johnson [...] before the primary, meanwhile Governor Reagan's name was {{on the ballot in}} Wisconsin, but he did not campaign in the state and was still not a declared candidate. Nixon won the primary with 80% followed by Reagan with 11% and Stassen with 6%. With Johnson removed from the race, Nixon fell behind Democratic candidates Eugene McCarthy, Hubert Humphrey and Robert Kennedy in head-to-head match-ups. At the end of April, Nixon called for a moratorium on criticism of the Johnson policy in Vietnam as negotiations were underway: [...] "The one man who can do anything about peace is Lyndon Johnson, and I'm {{not going to do anything}} to undercut him." [...] However, <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidates</b> for president remained fair game for criticism. He argued that [...] "A divided Democratic Party cannot unite a divided country; a united Republican Party can." [...] He also began to discuss economics more frequently, announcing plans to cut spending while criticizing the Democrats' policy of raising taxes. During a question and answer session with the American Society of Newspaper Editors, Nixon spoke out of turn, receiving numerous interruptions of applause. The largest came when he addressed the issue of crime, proclaiming that [...] "there cannot be order in a free society without progress, and there cannot be progress without order." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{different}} {{winners in}} Iowa and New Hampshire - and Mitt Romney taking the lower-profile Wyoming caucus - the January 15 Michigan primary loomed {{as an important}} battle, despite the state's delegation size being cut in half for holding the primary too early. Polls after New Hampshire showed a tight race between McCain and Romney, with Huckabee a close third. Many saw Michigan as Romney's last chance for a campaign-saving win after disappointments {{in the first two}} races. Others said that a win in Michigan could cement McCain's status as the [...] "front-runner" [...] for the nomination. McCain's campaign garnered about $1 million in newly contributed funds immediately after the New Hampshire win, but still had $3.5 million in bank debt. He was not alone in feeling a financial pinch; the entire Republican field suffered from a lack of enthusiasm and lower donations than <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidates</b> were receiving.|$|E
