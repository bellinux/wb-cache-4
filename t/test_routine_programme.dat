The sensitivity and specificity of the test were assessed and correlations made with the presence of HBsAg. The presence of anti-HBc was very useful in the interpretation of a doubtful positive result for HBsAg in the haemagglutination test.

40|$|It is {{at present}} {{considered}} important to include biological tests in measuring programmes of environmental samples {{to supplement the}} chemical and physical parameters that are currently used. A battery of tests is therefore necessary, also within a given “endpoint” (e. g., genotoxicity), because one single test will not give all the answers to our questions. As {{it is not possible}} to include all available <b>tests</b> in <b>routine</b> screening <b>programmes,</b> a selection of tests should be made. According to comparative investigations, the bacterial Ames test remains very important. When no preconcentration step is involved, other bacterial tests (e. g., the umu-C and VITOTOX® tests) may be recommended. The comet assay may be used in Daphnia or human white blood cells. Further validations, comparisons, mechanistic investigations, etc. remain necessary as differences are often found between the tests that are not solely explained by differences in genetic endpoint and that therefore should further be investigated and understood...|$|R
40|$|Summary: A fluorometric assay in microtitre plates for the {{screening}} of phenylketonuria was evaluated and adapted to a neonatal screening programme. Using this assay, {{it is possible}} to deterraine quantitatively the phenylalanine concentration in dried blood Spots on fiiter paper. The test exhibited a linear calibration curve with a good slope äs well äs sufficient precision and accuracy in the statistical analysis. Interference by other amino acids and antibiotics was not observed. Only elevated concentrations of leucine inter-fered to a small degree. l! The phenylalanine concentration in dried blood spots of 13 phenylketonuria patients correlated to that in serum. | 7381 dried blood samples of newborn infants were tested simultaneously by both the fluorometric and the Guthrie test. The results did not show significant differences. We screened 29182 newborns using the fluorometric assay and an online data processing programme. The internal! (repetition rate was 0. 64 %, the external recall rate 0. 15 %. False negative results were not observed.

40|$|Reported are {{the results}} of a study to {{investigate}} the immunogenicity of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) when administered in mass campaigns compared with that following <b>routine</b> immunization <b>programmes.</b> For this purpose, paired sera were collected from a cohort of children before and after a mass vaccination with OPV in Morocco in 1987. Serum samples and information on vaccination status and other confounding factors that could influence antibody responses to OPV were collected. Neutralizing antibody titres to poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 were determined using a standardized assay. OPV doses administered exclusively during the mass campaign were consistently associated with higher type-specific seroprevalence rates than the same number of doses administered in the <b>routine</b> <b>programme.</b> These findings could not be attributed to differences in confounding factors. Enhanced secondary spread of vaccine virus may have occurred but could not be demonstrated because of limitations in the study design. Mass campaigns appear to be highly effective in raising the dose-related poliovirus type-specific immunity of the population above that achieved by the <b>routine</b> immunization <b>programme.</b> Our findings support the continued use of mass campaigns as an adjunct to <b>routine</b> <b>programmes</b> in order to both enhance and catalyse current efforts to achieve the global eradication of poliomyelitis by the year 2000...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{feasibility}} {{and effectiveness of}} voluntary counselling, HIV testing and adjunctive cotrimoxazole in reducing mortality in a cohort of tuberculosis (TB) patients registered under <b>routine</b> <b>programme</b> conditions in a rural district of Malawi. DESIGN: 'Before' and 'after' cohort study using historical controls. METHODS: Between 1 July 1999 and 30 June 2000 all TB patients were started on standardized anti-TB treatment, and offered voluntary counselling and HIV testing (VCT). Those found to be HIV-positive were offered cotrimoxazole at a dose of 480 mg twice daily, provided there were no contraindications. Side-effects were monitored clinically. End-of-treatment outcomes in this cohort (intervention group) were compared with a cohort registered between 1 July 1998 and 30 June 1999 in whom VCT and cotrimoxazole was not offered (control group). FINDINGS: A total of 1986 patients was registered in the study: 1061 in the intervention group and 925 in the control cohort. In the intervention group, 1019 (96 %) patients were counselled pre-test, 964 (91 %) underwent HIV testing and 938 (88 %) were counselled post-test. The overall HIV-seroprevalence rate was 77 %. A total of 693 patients were given cotrimoxazole of whom 14 (2 %) manifested minor dermatological reactions. The adjusted relative risk {{of death in the}} intervention group compared with the control group was 0. 81 (P < 0. 001). The number needed to treat with VCT and adjunctive cotrimoxazole to prevent one death during anti-TB treatment was 12. 5. INTERPRETATION: This study shows that VCT and adjunctive cotrimoxazole is feasible, safe and reduces mortality rates in TB patients under <b>routine</b> <b>programme</b> conditions...|$|R
