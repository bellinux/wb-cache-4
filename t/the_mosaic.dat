5|$|In Yucatan, Morgan confronts Sahin and the Ottomans {{searching for}} the Lake and destroys the Ottoman base. However the Spanish conquistador, Francisco Juan Delgado de Leon, captures Sahin and some other Ottoman {{soldiers}} before Morgan can. Morgan is then forced to fight and defeat the Spanish, who are attacking Morgan's new allies, the Aztecs. After his battle to defend the Aztecs, Morgan realizes that Delgado and the Spanish were after the map to the Lake of the Moon disguised as <b>the</b> <b>mosaic</b> in the Aztecs' town square. <b>The</b> <b>mosaic</b> shows the Lake of the Moon being in Florida.|$|E
5|$|The House of the Masks {{is named}} after <b>the</b> <b>mosaic</b> motif of theatre masks decorating ivy scrolls {{arranged}} in strips around a central surface area decorated in a cubic pattern. The more intricately decorated mosaics are found in four different rooms branching off from the peristyle courtyard paved with marble chips, with corridor mosaics utilizing amphora fragments. In the center of one mosaic is the figure of Dionysos riding a leopard against a similar black background to <b>the</b> <b>mosaic</b> in the House of Dionysos. Another central mosaic features a flute player and a dancing figure, the latter perhaps representing Silenus. Only the Dionysos figure employs the vermiculatum method. The other mosaics of the house fail to achieve the naturalism of finer figure scenes and motifs, but they nevertheless demonstrate an attempt at mimicking their illusionist qualities with the tesselated technique.|$|E
5|$|Four large mosaic {{panels are}} {{installed}} on either {{ends of the}} station hall and the two escalator tunnels. On the side {{that leads to the}} exit to the city, a panel was installed depicting the patron saint of Kiev, Michael the Archangel. Meanwhile, {{at the very end of}} the station, Saint George is depicted, symbolizing Moscow, the Soviet Union's capital at the time. One of <b>the</b> <b>mosaic</b> panels at the end of the station near the escalators includes an inscription featuring a Ukrainian nationalist slogan, stating СЛАВА УКРАЇНІ, which is translated as Glory to Ukraine.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Antioch <b>mosaics</b> {{were created}} {{at a time}} and place between {{distinct}} artistic styles. They show the link between artistic styles of ancient Greece and Rome, and the art of early Christianity. <b>The</b> <b>mosaics</b> are incredibly large, with [...] "The Worcester Hunt," [...] <b>the</b> largest Antioch <b>mosaic</b> in <b>the</b> United States, measuring 6.26 m x 7.11 m. <b>The</b> <b>mosaics</b> range in design from realistic imagery and scenes, to purely geometric patterns. It is believed that <b>the</b> <b>mosaics</b> were created by mosaic specialists.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>mosaics</b> were {{discovered}} during {{the building of}} new houses using bricks from older buildings.

5|$|On June 26, 1934, {{work began}} on {{the removal of the}} twelfth century Byzantine mosaics. It was {{conducted}} by <b>the</b> <b>Mosaic</b> Section of the Leningrad Academy of Fine Arts. Specialists were forced to work in haste on account of the impending demolition and were thus unable to complete the entire project. Despite the care and attention shown during the removal of the mosaics from the cathedral's walls, the relocated mosaics cannot be relied upon as being absolutely authentic.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mosaics</b> at <b>the</b> Sacred Heart were {{designed}} by Gabriel Pippet and carried out by Maurice Josey, assisted by Fred Oates. They were begun in 1921 and took 12 years to complete. Eight and a half tons of quarter-inch glass was imported from Venice for the purpose. The influence of <b>the</b> <b>mosaics</b> of Ravenna is very apparent. Indeed, Pippet travelled to Ravenna and Rome to study <b>the</b> <b>mosaics</b> before completing <b>the</b> designs.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mosaics</b> in <b>the</b> apse {{were stolen}} from the church after 1975 and some sold on the art market in the USA, an event {{reported}} in the New York Times (21 July 1989) and other papers. After a protracted legal battle, ownership of <b>the</b> <b>mosaics</b> was recognised and they were returned to Cyprus. They are currently {{on display in the}} Byzantine Museum, Nicosia. However, some parts of <b>the</b> <b>mosaics</b> are still missing.|$|R
2500|$|These mosaics gave historians {{insight into}} artistic, religious, and social {{movements}} during this time. As Margaret Miles explains <b>the</b> <b>mosaics</b> in Santa Maria Maggiore have two goals: one to glorify the Virgin Mary as Theotokos (God-Bearer); {{and the other}} to present [...] "a systematic and comprehensive articulation of the relationship of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian scriptures as one in which the Hebrew Bible foreshadows Christianity." [...] This is explained by the dual images of Old Testament and New Testament events depicted in <b>the</b> <b>mosaics</b> of <b>the</b> triumphal arch and <b>the</b> nave. <b>The</b> <b>mosaics</b> also show <b>the</b> range of artistic expertise and refute <b>the</b> theory that <b>mosaic</b> technique during <b>the</b> time was based on copying from model books. <b>The</b> <b>mosaics</b> found in Santa Maria Maggiore are combinations of different styles of <b>mosaic</b> art during <b>the</b> time, according to art scholar Robin Cormack: [...] "the range of artistic expertise and the actual complexities of production can hardly be reduced to a mentality of copying. A test case is given by <b>the</b> <b>mosaics</b> of S. Maria Maggiore in Rome".|$|R
5|$|Since its erection, the {{building}} has undergone significant repair, renovation and conservation, including work on {{the building}} fabric, the stained glass windows, <b>the</b> <b>mosaic</b> floors in the chancel and sanctuary and conservation of the Children's Chapel. Major work was done on the interior and the spire in the 1890s and on the crypt in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The House of Orpheus in the {{southern}} part of the city thus takes its name from the large mosaic depicting Orpheus playing his harp to an audience of trees, animals and birds. As Paul MacKendrick puts it, <b>the</b> <b>mosaic</b> is rather artlessly executed, as the animals are all of different sizes and face in different directions with no relationship to Orpheus. It appears that the mosaicist simply copied patterns from a book without attempting to integrate the different elements. <b>The</b> <b>mosaic</b> is situated in the triclinium, the dining room, where the diners would have reclined on couches set against the walls and admired the central mosaic. Other mosaics can be seen in the atrium, which has a depiction of Amphitrite in a chariot pulled by a seahorse and accompanied by other sea creatures, and in the bathing rooms. One room off the main courtyard has a mosaic of a dolphin, considered by the Romans to be a lucky animal.|$|E
5|$|The House of Venus, {{towards the}} eastern side of the city under a {{prominent}} cypress tree, was one of the most luxurious residences in the city. It had a set of private baths and a richly decorated interior, with fine mosaics dating from the 2nd century AD showing animal and mythological scenes. There were mosaics in seven corridors and eight rooms. The central courtyard has a fanciful mosaic depicting racing chariots in a hippodrome, drawn by teams of peacocks, geese and ducks. <b>The</b> <b>mosaic</b> of Venus for which the house is named has been removed to Tangier, but in the next-door room is a still-extant mosaic showing Diana and a companion nymph being surprised by Actaeon while bathing. Actaeon is depicted with horns beginning to sprout from his head as he is transformed by the angry goddess into a stag, before being chased down and killed by his own hunting dogs. The house appears to have been destroyed some time after the city's fall around 280; a mosaic depicting Cupids feeding birds with grain has been charred by what appears to have been a fire burning directly on top of it, perhaps resulting from the building being taken over by squatters who used <b>the</b> <b>mosaic</b> as the site of a hearth.|$|E

5|$|The {{new wealth}} being {{generated}} {{during this period}} had {{a positive impact on}} Byzantine cultural life.

5|$|The {{station is}} {{illuminated}} by two-tierd bronze chandeliers, each featuring 12 distinct lighting groups holding candle-like bulbs. The chandeliers, designed by Stanislav Adamenko and Mariya Ralko, were installed between <b>the</b> <b>mosaic</b> stripes. Both the station halls and the underground vestibule feature similar light fixtures, {{although they are}} significantly smaller than the main chandeliers. The redesign also called for a gold smalt-covered ceiling, although this was rejected as it was too expensive. To finish it off, gray granite was used on the floor.|$|E
5|$|The stone nave pulpit was {{designed}} by the restorer R.C.Hussey and the lectern, dated 1876, is by Skidmore. <b>The</b> <b>mosaic</b> floor of the tower bay {{was designed}} by Dean Howson and executed by Burke and Co.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>mosaics</b> of <b>the</b> Venetian Church of San Marco embody {{how this}} empire used imagery for {{political}} and ecclesiastical purposes. The church of San Marco is recognized as a force which drew the island fragments of primitive Venice into a unified city and empire. This paper will examine <b>the</b> thirteenth-century <b>mosaics</b> by analyzing {{a variety of factors}} in the visual environment and the iconography of <b>the</b> <b>mosaics</b> themselves. First, I will examine briefly the nature medieval visuality and the previous architectural and artistic tradition within San Marco, moving then to analysis of <b>the</b> <b>mosaics</b> of <b>the</b> Old Testament cycle, the methods of transfer, and the model from which they were made. Next, I will explore <b>the</b> <b>mosaics</b> of <b>the</b> Cappella Zen and the South Transept as they pertain to the legend of Saint Mark. Last, I will present the historical context of the imagery in thirteenth-century Venice as well as the history of imitation and appropriation at San Marco. Finally, I will examine {{as a part of the}} historical context the medieval concept of time and history within the thirteenth-century environment, how it continues with and departs from prior traditions, and what this illustrates about <b>the</b> <b>mosaics</b> and <b>the</b> use of time and historical memory.

5|$|Depicted in <b>the</b> <b>mosaic</b> Map of Madaba of 600, Gaza was {{the most}} {{important}} political and commercial center on the southern coast of Palestine. Its northern municipal border was marked by Wadi al-Hesi, just before Ashkelon, and its southern boundary is unknown, but Gaza's jurisdiction did not reach Raphia. The towns of Bethelea, Asalea, Gerarit and Kissufim were included in Gaza's territories. Its large representation, approximately half of which is preserved, cannot be easily explained, mainly because only small tentative excavations have been made there and because Byzantine Gaza is covered by the still inhabited Old City.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1944 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, McClintock began {{systematic}} studies on the mechanisms of <b>the</b> <b>mosaic</b> color patterns of maize seed and the unstable inheritance of this mosaicism. She identified two new dominant and interacting genetic loci that she named Dissociator (Ds) and Activator (Ac). She found that the Dissociator did not just dissociate or cause the chromosome to break, it also had a variety of effects on neighboring genes when the Activator was also present, which included making certain stable mutations unstable. In early 1948, she made the surprising discovery that both Dissociator and Activator could transpose, or change position, on the chromosome.|$|E

5|$|Large {{numbers of}} Christians from {{throughout}} Jordan, particularly from al-Salt, {{have moved to}} Amman. Nearby Fuheis is a predominantly Christian town located to the northwest of the city. A small Armenian Catholic community of around 70 families {{is present in the}} city. Ecclesiastical courts for matters of personal status are also located in Amman. A total of 16 historic churches are located in Umm ar-Rasas ruins in Al-Jeezah district; the site is believed to have initially served as Roman fortified military camps which gradually became a town around the 5th century AD. It has not been completely excavated. It was influenced by several civilizations including the Romans, Byzantines and Muslims. The site contains some well-preserved mosaic floors, particularly <b>the</b> <b>mosaic</b> floor of the Church of Saint Stephen.|$|E
5|$|The Chenes {{style is}} very similar to the Puuc style, but predates the use of <b>the</b> <b>mosaic</b> façades of the Puuc region. It {{featured}} fully adorned façades on both the upper and lower sections of structures. Some doorways were surrounded by mosaic masks of monsters representing mountain or sky deities, identifying the doorways as entrances to the supernatural realm. Some buildings contained interior stairways that accessed different levels. The Chenes style is most commonly encountered in the southern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula, although individual buildings in the style can be found elsewhere in the peninsula. Examples of Chenes sites include Dzibilnocac, Hochob, Santa Rosa Xtampak, and Tabasqueño.|$|E
5|$|The Round Church was {{unmatched}} in its ceramic decoration by any {{church in}} Preslav, {{and was the}} only known building {{in the city to}} rely heavily on polychrome ceramic tiles. Ceramic and mosaic icons were a highlight of the interior; they ranged in size from almost life-sized to miniature. While the ceramic images were constructed out of clay tiles, <b>the</b> <b>mosaic</b> icons were more varied in their material, which included clay, glass, and stone of various shades on a gold-coloured background. Among the portrayed saints and biblical figures are Charalampus and perhaps Joel. Some of the images were enclosed in ellipses.|$|E
