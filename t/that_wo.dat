6000|$|It {{is on his}} Songs, as we believe, that Burns's chief {{influence}} as an author will ultimately be found to depend: nor, if our Fletcher's aphorism is true, shall we account this a small influence.

60|$|We {{consulted}} on the subject, {{calling on}} the Indian to aid us. After talking the matter over, it was determined to remain where we were, securing the door, and bringing everybody within the building; for the negroes and the Indians had been much {{in the habit of}} sleeping about, under brush covers that they had erected for themselves. It was thought that, having once visited the hut, and finding it empty, the enemy, if enemy there were, would not be very likely to return to it immediately, and <b>that</b> <b>wo</b> might consider our selves as comparatively safe, from that circumstance alone. Then, there were all the chances that the trail might have been left by friendly, instead of hostile Indians, although Susquesus shook his head in the negative, whenever this was mentioned. At all events, we had but a choice of three expedients--to abandon the Patent, and seek safety in flight; to 'camp out;' or to shut ourselves up in our fortress. Of the first, no one thought for a moment; and of the two others, we decided on the last, as far the most comfortable, and, on the whole, as the safest.|$|E

40|$|The Wee 1 kinase {{inhibits}} {{entry into}} mitosis by phosphorylation of the Cdc 2 kinase. Searching for multicopy suppressors that abolish this inhibition in the fission yeast, {{we have identified}} a novel gene, here named wos 2, encoding a protein with significant homology to human p 23, an Hsp 90 -associated cochaperone. The deletion mutant has a modest phenotype, being heat-shock sensitive. Using antibodies raised against bacterially produced protein, we determined <b>that</b> <b>Wos</b> 2 is very abundant, ubiquitously distributed in the yeast cell, and its expression dropped drastically as cells entered into early stationary phase, indicating that its function is associated with cell proliferation. In proliferating cells, the amount of Wos 2 protein was not subjected to cell cycle regulation. However, in vitro assays demonstrated that this Hsp 90 cochaperone is potentially regulated by phosphorylation. In addition to suppressing Wee 1 activity, overproduction of Wos 2 displayed synthetic lethality with Cdc 2 mutant proteins, indicating that this Hsp 90 cochaperone functionally interacts with Cdc 2. The level of Cdc 2 protein and its associated H 1 kinase activity under synthetic lethal conditions suggested a regulatory role for this Wos 2 -Cdc 2 interaction. Hsp 90 complexes are required for CDK regulation; the synergy found between the excess of Wos 2 and a deficiency in Hsp 90 activity suggests <b>that</b> <b>Wos</b> 2 could specifically interfere with the Hsp 90 -dependent regulation of Cdc 2. In vitro analysis indicated that the above genetic interactions could take place by physical association of Wos 2 with the single CDK complex of the fission yeast. Expression of the budding yeast p 23 protein (encoded by the SBA 1 gene) in the fission yeast indicated <b>that</b> <b>Wos</b> 2 and Sba 1 are functionally exchangeable and therefore that properties described here for Wos 2 could be of wide significance in understanding the biological function of cochaperone p 23 in eukaryotic cells...|$|R

30|$|Next, {{the growth}} of WO 3 {{nanorods}} from the tungsten prominence is discussed. Engel et al. investigated the tungsten face that most easily absorbed oxygen and determined that the (110) face of tungsten absorbed the most oxygen [15]. Figure 4 suggests that the side edge of the prominence was (110) of tungsten and oxygen absorbed preferentially on (110). It was also inferred <b>that</b> <b>WO</b> 3 formed preferentially on (110) of {{the edge of the}} tungsten prominence, and then oxygen absorbed on the (010) face of the WO 3 formed on the tungsten prominence. After that, the (010) and (001) faces of WO 3, which absorbed oxygen easily and are the closest and close-packed planes [16], grew. The origin of the tungsten is the bottom of the tungsten wire, so this acts as the tungsten supply for the nanorods. Therefore, {{the growth of}} WO 3 {{on the edge of the}} nanorod starts from the bottom to the top of the nanorod. The reason <b>that</b> <b>WO</b> 3 nanorod growth disappears at the area covered by the natural oxide layer when the tungsten wire was heated is that the tungsten prominence, which has the planes that easily absorb oxygen, do not grow.|$|E

The highest acidity of WO 3 -Ppy- 20 is also confirmed using TPD-NH 3 analysis.
