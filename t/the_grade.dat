5|$|The Civil Air Patrol {{is headed}} by a {{national}} commander, currently Major General Joseph Vazquez. The organization is governed by a board of governors, established by federal law in 2001 and consisting of 11 members: four Civil Air Patrol members (currently the national commander, national vice commander, and two members-at-large appointed by the CAP National Executive Committee), four United States Air Force representatives appointed by the Secretary of the Air Force, and three members from the aviation community jointly appointed by the CAP national commander and the Secretary of the Air Force. The board of governors generally meets {{two or three times}} annually and primarily provides strategic vision and guidance to the volunteer leadership and corporate staff. The volunteer leadership consists of the national commander and his staff, comprising a Vice Commander, Chief of Staff, National Legal Officer, National comptroller, the Chief of the CAP Chaplain Service, and the CAP Inspector General. The national commander holds <b>the</b> <b>grade</b> of CAP major general; the national vice commander holds <b>the</b> <b>grade</b> of CAP brigadier general.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze the quality of English summative test taken by the {{students}} of MAN Boarding School Meulaboh I in terms of validity, reliability, difficulty index, discrimination index, {{and the effectiveness of}} distractors. Content analysis was employed in this study. Two techniques were carried out to collect the data, namely checklist and document analysis. The data from checklist were analyzed by using a statistical procedure in percentage form and the data from document analysis were analyzed by using Anates Software version 4. The results showed that English summative test in the context of content analysis of <b>the</b> first <b>grade</b> has sufficient validity, <b>the</b> second <b>grade</b> has poor validity, and <b>the</b> third <b>grade</b> has a very poor validity. However, in terms of construct validity <b>the</b> first <b>grade</b> and <b>the</b> third <b>grade</b> have poor construct validity, while <b>the</b> second <b>grade</b> has sufficient construct validity. Meanwhile, in terms of validity coefficient, <b>the</b> first <b>grade</b> and <b>the</b> third <b>grade</b> is 60 % and <b>the</b> second <b>grade</b> is 44 %. Secondly, English summative test of MAN Boarding School has a consistent degree of reliability. The reliability index of <b>the</b> first <b>grade</b> and <b>the</b> second <b>grade</b> test is 0. 70 and <b>the</b> third <b>grade</b> is 0. 88. Thirdly, 60 % of the test in <b>the</b> first <b>grade</b> test, 48 % of which in <b>the</b> second <b>grade,</b> and 8 % of which in <b>the</b> third <b>grade</b> test are accepted. It means that <b>the</b> third <b>grade</b> has a very poor difficulty index. Fourthly, a good discrimination index of the test in <b>the</b> first <b>grade</b> is 76 %, second grade is 56 %, and <b>the</b> third <b>grade</b> is 72 %. In other words, more than half of discrimination index is good. Finally, the quality of distractors of English summative test of <b>the</b> third <b>grade</b> is not as good as that of <b>the</b> first <b>grade</b> and second <b>grade.</b> <b>The</b> effectiveness of English summative test in first grade is 53 %, <b>the</b> second <b>grade</b> is 67 %, and <b>the</b> third <b>grade</b> is 50 %.

50|$|Ordinary {{matrices}} can {{be thought}} of as the coordinate representations of linear maps between vector spaces (or free modules). Likewise, supermatrices {{can be thought}} of as the coordinate representations of linear maps between super vector spaces (or free supermodules). There is an important difference in <b>the</b> <b>graded</b> case, however. A homomorphism from one super vector space to another is, by definition, one that preserves <b>the</b> <b>grading</b> (i.e. maps even elements to even elements and odd elements to odd elements). The coordinate representation of such a transformation is always an even supermatrix. Odd supermatrices correspond to linear transformations that reverse <b>the</b> <b>grading.</b> General supermatrices represent an arbitrary ungraded linear transformation. Such transformations are still important in <b>the</b> <b>graded</b> case, although less so than <b>the</b> <b>graded</b> (even) transformations.|$|R
40|$|This {{monograph}} {{is devoted}} to a comprehensive study of graded rings and graded K-theory. A bird's eye view of <b>the</b> <b>graded</b> module theory over a graded ring gives an impression of the module theory with the added adjective "graded" to all its statements. Once <b>the</b> <b>grading</b> {{is considered to be}} trivial, <b>the</b> <b>graded</b> theory reduces to the usual module theory. So from this perspective, <b>the</b> <b>graded</b> module theory can be considered {{as an extension of the}} module theory. However, one aspect that could be easily missed from such a panoramic view is that, <b>the</b> <b>graded</b> module theory comes equipped with a shifting, thanks to being able to partition the structures and rearranging these partitions. This adds an extra layer of structure (and complexity) to the theory. An sparkling example of this is <b>the</b> theory of <b>graded</b> Grothendieck groups, K^gr_ 0, which is the main focus of this monograph. Whereas the usual K_ 0 is an abelian group, thanks to the shiftings, K^gr_ 0 has a natural Z[Γ]-module structure, where Γ is <b>the</b> <b>graded</b> group. As we will see throughout this note, this extra structure carries a substantial information about <b>the</b> <b>graded</b> ring. Comment: 240 pages; To appear in London Math. Soc.
