In 1865, congressional opposition likewise caused Seddon to withdraw, and he was replaced by John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|In Congress, Nixon {{supported}} the Taft–Hartley Act of 1947, {{a federal law}} that monitors the activities and power of labor unions, and he served on the Education and Labor Committee.

5|$|Allegations of {{research}} misconduct or improprieties have received substantial press coverage. Professor David Baltimore, a Nobel Laureate, became {{embroiled in a}} misconduct investigation starting in 1986 that led <b>to</b> <b>Congressional</b> hearings in 1991. Professor Ted Postol has accused the MIT administration since 2000 of attempting to whitewash potential research misconduct at the Lincoln Lab facility involving a ballistic missile defense test, though a final investigation into the matter has not been completed. Associate Professor Luk Van Parijs was dismissed in 2005 following allegations of scientific misconduct and found guilty of the same by the United States Office of Research Integrity in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Reaction to Huie's {{interview}} with Bryant and Milam was explosive. Their brazen admission {{that they had}} murdered Till caused prominent civil rights leaders to push the federal government harder to investigate the case. Till's murder contributed <b>to</b> <b>congressional</b> passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957: it authorized the U.S. Department of Justice to intervene in local law enforcement issues when individual civil rights were being compromised. Huie's interview, in which Milam and Bryant said they had acted alone, overshadowed inconsistencies in earlier versions of the stories. As a consequence, details about Collins and Loggins and others who had possibly been involved in Till's abduction and murder, or the subsequent cover-up, were forgotten, according to historians David and Linda Beito.|$|E

5|$|Throughout its life, the platform's {{software}} {{has been}} upgraded {{several times and}} although these upgrades were due to be stopped as part of plans to retire the A-10 in February 2014, Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James ordered that the latest upgrade, designated Suite 8, continue in response <b>to</b> <b>Congressional</b> pressure. Suite 8 software includes IFF Mode 5, which modernizes the ability to identify the A-10 to friendly units. Additionally, the Pave Penny pods and pylons are being removed as their receive-only capability {{has been replaced by}} the AN/AAQ-28(V)4 LITENING AT targeting pods or Sniper XR targeting pod, which both have laser designators and laser rangefinders.|$|E
5|$|In February 2016, in {{response}} to the spread of the Zika virus, the Obama administration requested that Congress appropriate $1.9billion to fight the spread of the disease. Congress did not initially take action, leaving Burwell to direct the Department of Health and Human Services to reprogram $589million in funds previously designated as part of the response to Ebola, to fight the spread of the Zika virus. Of the initial Zika funding, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) received $222million to lead the domestic fight against the virus with the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority splitting $152million for the domestic effort. In response <b>to</b> <b>Congressional</b> complaints that the money was not being spent fast enough, Burwell informed Congress that without further funding the CDC's funding to fight Zika would be depleted by September30, 2016. After Burwell moved funding from other HHS programs, Congress finally appropriated $1.1billion to fight the spread of Zika in the United States. By the end of September 2016, the United States reported 23,000 cases in the territory of Puerto Rico, 3,000 cases in the states, and 21babies born in the United States with microcephaly testing positive for Zika.|$|E
