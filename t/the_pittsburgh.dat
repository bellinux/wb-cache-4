5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pittsburgher</b> began {{operation}} on January 14, 1924. <b>The</b> <b>Pittsburgher</b> was <b>the</b> premier Pennsylvania train operating between New York and Pittsburgh. Although not streamlined in 1938 {{as part of}} the [...] "Fleet of Modernism", it was completely upgraded with streamlined equipment (but with no observation car) at the express request of U.S. steel business clientele. Although the train was considered all-Pullman, it frequently carried coaches on the end for day travelers going to Pittsburgh and back. In 1944, <b>the</b> <b>Pittsburgher</b> was discontinued as part of a government order that prohibited the use of sleeping cars between points less than 450 mi apart so the government could free up sleeping cars for the war effort. The next day, it was reinstated as a day train between the two points. By late 1945, it was back to running as an overnight, all-Pullman train between New York and Pittsburgh. Service was discontinued in 1964, and its sleepers were transferred to the Manhattan Limited.|$|R

5|$|As the {{reputation}} of the Mars Works grew, so too did the demand for its products. After a few years the Mars Works began exporting its engines inland. Oliver Evans's son George was the first such order, having moved to Pittsburgh in 1809 to operate <b>the</b> <b>Pittsburgh</b> Steam Flour Mill. George and the mill were highly successful, and generated a great deal of interest in Evans's engines across the interior. However exporting engines to western Pennsylvania, Kentucky or Ohio was challenging and expensive from a logistical perspective. In 1811 Evans and George, as well as another successful steam miller and engineer Luther Stephens, founded <b>the</b> <b>Pittsburgh</b> Steam Engine Company, which in addition to engines would, like the Mars Works, produce heavy machinery and castings in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. With high demand for industrial products and relatively little industrial capacity, <b>the</b> <b>Pittsburgh</b> works added to its repertoire the capacity for brasswork, as well as producing finer products for domestic purposes like hinges and fittings.|$|E
