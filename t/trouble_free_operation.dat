To achieve these benefits, however, extra {{care must be taken}} in selecting the appropriate system of pump, motor, and electronic motor driver of VFD for optimum interaction with the process system. Successful pump selection requires knowledge of the full anticipated range of heads, flows, and specific gravities.

VFD selection requires an understanding of the electronic technology employed to determine what effect the VFD may have on the mechanical aspects of the driven equipment train.

Aiming to reduce this gap we developed a flow cytometer called CytoBuoy for autonomous in situ operation, for instance in a moored buoy with wireless data transfer. Although not comparable to microscopy, flow cytometers detect and count particles allowing a limited level of particle characterization based on the light scatter and fluorescence properties of the individual particles.

To achieve the maximum attainable efficiency at loads other than rated values, it is necessary to regulate the flux level by changing the voltage/frequency suitably at any given motor load.

Maximum attainable efficiency operation of an IM at partial loads may be obtained by using a controller which can search for the maximum attainable efficiency condition at the given partial load and then operate the IM at that condition.

40|$|AbstractEffective {{control of}} roof strata is very {{important}} for <b>trouble</b> <b>free</b> <b>operation</b> and regular face advance in mechanised longwall workings. It is now technically possible to exploit coal seams in difficult geo-mining conditions with the help of newer innovations in longwall face machineries. A reliable assessment of caving behaviour and support capacity requirement helps in selecting supports of adequate capacity and making operational preparedness for timely and confident solution of impending problems. This paper reviews the mechanism of roof caving and the conventional approaches of caving behaviour and support requirement in the context of major strata control experiences gained worldwide. The review shows that a number of approaches are being used for advance prediction of caving behaviour and support capacity requirement in a variety of geo-mining conditions. The theoretical explanation of the mechanism of roof caving and the design function of roof supports have been worked out through staged development of approaches, their evaluation followed by their gradual modification and enrichment of synthesized findings. This process is still continuing with consistently improved understanding through growing field experiences in the larger domain of geo-mining conditions and state-of-art strata analysis and monitoring techniques. These attempts have contributed significantly to improving the level of understanding and reducing the gap of uncertainty in planning and design of longwall operation in a given geo-mining condition...|$|E
40|$|A {{radiological}} groundwater plume {{was discovered}} {{to be discharging}} into a surface stream and portions of the storm drain network at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). A CERCLA removal action was initiated to address the discharges. The plume {{was found to be}} migrating 65 degrees oblique to the overall hydraulic gradient and was identified only after historic data were analyzed and field tests were performed under the working hypothesis of stratabound flow and transport. A detailed geologic and hydrologic analysis was performed that accurately predicted the 3 -dimensional plume configuration from a single point datum where significantly elevated contaminant levels were found in a bedrock core hole. Subsequent sampling found that direct discharges of contamination existed in the stream only in the location of the predicted stratum. The affected storm drain outfall discharges were suspected to be the major contributors to {sup 90 }Sr surface water risk from ORNL. Thus, the selected removal action focused on eliminating the known seepage to the storm drain network. Intercept system operations reduced the total surface water {sup 90 }Sr flux by about 90 %. Ongoing investigations seek to identify the source of the plume with the hope that the intercept system may eventually be deactivated.

Their performance has been exceptional; however, with deregulation now on the horizon, the frequency and scope of maintenance of these devices has become an issue of concern. Maintenance is certainly important to the proper operation and reliability of tap changing transformers, but time-based maintenance is costly and can erode profitability of a company if unnecessary maintenance is routinely performed on any device. Operations counter-based maintenance is an improved approach but cumulative operations are not always a reliable trigger of need for maintenance.
