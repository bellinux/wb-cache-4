5|$|During the {{extensive}} research Hergé carried out for The Blue Lotus, he became influenced by Chinese and Japanese illustrative styles and woodcuts. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> noticeable in the seascapes, which {{are reminiscent of}} works by Hokusai and Hiroshige.|$|E
5|$|Piezoelectric {{crystals}} {{are also}} sometimes used in mechanical filter designs. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> true for resonators {{that are also}} acting as transducers for inputs and outputs.|$|E
5|$|Although Triatominae bugs feed on them, birds {{appear to}} be immune to {{infection}} and therefore are {{not considered to be}} a T. cruzi reservoir. Even when colonies of insects are eradicated from a house and surrounding domestic animal shelters, they can re-emerge from plants or animals {{that are part of the}} ancient, sylvatic (referring to wild animals) infection cycle. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> likely in zones with mixed open savannah, with clumps of trees interspersed by human habitation.|$|E

5|$|Ambulance {{services}} that have historical origins {{such as the}} Order of St John, the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps and Malteser International often use the Maltese cross to identify their ambulances. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> important {{in countries such as}} Australia, where St. John Ambulance operate one state and one territory ambulance service, and all of Australia's other ambulance services use variations on a red Maltese cross.|$|E
5|$|As {{one area}} in which OPEC members {{have been able to}} {{cooperate}} productively over the decades, the organization has significantly improved {{the quality and quantity of}} information available about the international oil market. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> helpful for a natural-resource industry whose smooth functioning requires months and years of careful planning.|$|E
5|$|Dyadic joint {{attention}} is a conversation-like behavior that individuals engage in. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> true for human adults and infants, {{who engage in}} this behavior starting at two months of age. Adults and infants take turns exchanging facial expressions, noises, {{and in the case}} of the adult, speech.|$|E

5|$|HDR {{brachytherapy}} for nonmelanomatous skin cancer, such as {{basal cell}} carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, provides an alternative treatment option to surgery. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> relevant for cancers on the nose, ears, eyelids or lips, where surgery may cause disfigurement or require extensive reconstruction. Various applicators {{can be used to}} ensure close contact between the radiation source(s) and the skin, which conform to the curvature of the skin and help ensure precision delivery of the optimal irradiation dose.|$|E
5|$|Merits: As Weber himself noted, real {{bureaucracy}} {{will be less}} optimal {{and effective}} than his ideal-type model. Each of Weber's principles can degenerateand more so, when {{they are used to}} analyze the individual level in an organization. But, when implemented in a group setting in an organization, some form of efficiency and effectiveness can be achieved, especially with regard to better output. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> true when the Bureaucratic model emphasizes qualification (merits), specialization of job-scope (labour), hierarchy of power, rules and discipline.|$|E
5|$|Some {{birds and}} insects use {{defensive}} regurgitation {{to ward off}} predators. The northern fulmar vomits a bright orange, oily substance called stomach oil when threatened. The stomach oil is made from their aquatic diets. It causes the predator's feathers to mat, leading {{to the loss of}} flying ability and the loss of water repellency. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> dangerous for aquatic birds because their water repellent feathers protect them from hypothermia when diving for food.|$|E

50|$|During the War in Bosnia, {{inhabitants}} {{along the}} mouth of the river were expelled and murdered. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> true for the villages of Vrbanjci, Večići, Hrvaćani, Garići, and Rujevica.|$|R
5|$|Tail lift or ramp – Ambulances can {{be fitted}} with a tail lift or ramp in order to {{facilitate}} loading a patient without having to undertake any lifting. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> important where the patient is obese or specialty care transports that require large, bulky equipment such as a neonatal incubator or hospital beds. There may also be equipment linked to this such as winches which are designed to pull heavy patients into the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} modification is {{expansion of the}} original material. The expansions frequently repeat preceding measures or consist of rests or left-hand figurations without the melody, providing a pause in the motion. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> noticeable in the Adagio, minuet and finale of the C minor Sonata, the middle section of the Andantino in the A major Sonata, and the first movement of the B-flat Sonata.|$|E
5|$|A {{transitional}} fossil is any fossilized {{remains of}} a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> important where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. These fossils serve {{as a reminder that}} taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually no way to know exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that transitional fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.|$|E

50|$|In optical instruments, {{dispersion}} {{leads to}} chromatic aberration; a color-dependent blurring that sometimes is the resolution-limiting effect. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> true in refracting telescopes, before {{the invention of}} achromatic objective lenses.|$|R
5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> common in infants and toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near the airway or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.|$|E
5|$|Due to A. rubrums {{very wide}} range, there is {{significant}} variation in hardiness, size, form, time of flushing, onset of dormancy, and other traits. Generally speaking, individuals from the north flush the earliest, have the most reddish fall color, set their buds the earliest and take the least winter injury. Seedlings are tallest in the north-central and east-central part of the range. In Florida, at the extreme south of the red maple's range, it is limited exclusively to swamplands. The fruits also vary geographically with northern individuals in areas with brief, frost-free periods producing fruits that are shorter and heavier than their southern counterparts. As {{a result of the}} variation there is much genetic potential for breeding programs with a goal of producing red maples for cultivation. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> useful for making urban cultivars that require resistance from verticillium wilt, air pollution, and drought.|$|E
5|$|Food waste puts a large {{burden on}} the {{finances}} of each household and local councils in the UK; wasted food is estimated to cost each British household £250–£400 per year, accumulating to £15,000–£24,000 over a lifetime. This comes from the total purchasing cost of the food against what is thrown away uneaten. Additionally, households pay for the collection and disposal of food waste by their local council {{in the form of}} council tax. For councils, the cost of food waste comes from its collection and disposal {{as a part of the}} waste stream; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> an issue for councils that run separate food waste collections.|$|E

5|$|In {{most cases}} the {{electrons}} are close enough to thermal equilibrium that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even {{when there is a}} significant deviation from a Maxwellian energy distribution function, for example, due to UV radiation, energetic particles, or strong electric fields. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the ambient temperature.|$|E
5|$|In tsunami prone regions, strong {{earthquakes}} {{serve as}} familiar warnings, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> true for earthquakes in Indonesia. Previous {{estimates of the}} tsunami hazard for the Java coastline may have minimized the risk to the area, and to the northwest along the Sumatran coast, the risk is substantially higher for tsunami, especially near Padang. Previous events {{along the coast of}} Java in 1921 and again in 1994 illustrate the need for an accurate assessment of the threat. The July 2006 earthquake had an unusually slow rupture velocity which resulted in minor shaking on land for around three minutes, but the intensity was very light relative {{to the size of the}} tsunami that followed.|$|E
5|$|Nearby {{tracts of}} habitat {{strongly}} affect the wildlife in the Balch Creek watershed. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> true of Forest Park, which extends into other watersheds to the northwest. Birds and animals from these watersheds {{and from the}} Tualatin River valley, the Coast Range, the Willamette River, Sauvie Island, the Columbia River, and the Vancouver, Washington, lowlands, {{move in and out}} of the park with relative ease. Sixty-two mammal species, including the northern flying squirrel, black-tailed deer, creeping vole, bobcat, coyote, Mazama pocket gopher, little brown bat, Roosevelt elk, and Pacific jumping mouse use Forest Park. blue grouse, great horned owl, hairy woodpecker, Bewick's wren, orange-crowned warbler, osprey, and hermit thrush are among the 112species of birds that frequent the area. Amphibian species seen at the Audubon Society pond include rough-skinned newts, Pacific tree frogs, and salamanders.|$|E
5000|$|The {{counties}} of Scotland before reorganisation in 1889 included dozens of exclaves. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> notable {{in the case}} of Cromartyshire, which was split into at least nine parts spread across Ross-shire.|$|R
