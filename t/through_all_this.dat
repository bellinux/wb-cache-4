5|$|At 05:13 on 5 August, Bridgeports lookouts spotted Ushant Light. At 06:40, SC-48 sighted a torpedo {{and sounded}} a warning. Two minutes later, men {{on board the}} tender saw the torpedo wake on Bridgeports port quarter. Orders came down for full left rudder and full speed ahead. Bridgeport swung barely out of harm's way as men on her stern {{observed}} the torpedo disappear {{on the port side}} and reappear to starboard. It passed five feet astern, barely clearing the rudder. The starboard battery fired one shot {{in the direction of the}} torpedo—which broached on the starboard quarter—while the port guns fired in the direction from which the torpedo had come. Meanwhile, two destroyers, with a number of subchasers, hurried toward the spot where the torpedo wake had apparently begun and dropped depth charges. Bridgeport ceased fire and resumed her place in the formation. <b>Through</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> activity, no one actually saw the submarine that had fired the torpedo.|$|E

He was seen speaking to producer Rick Rubin in the studio about the album saying, [...] " [...] is about, like this duality of how do you navigate through this whole thing, through success, through failures, <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> and remain yourself." [...] The commercial featured producers that are confirmed {{to be on the}} album including Timbaland, Swizz Beatz and Pharrell Williams. The album was made available for free download on July 4, 12:01a.m. EST, to the first one million Samsung Galaxy S III, Samsung Galaxy S4 and Samsung Galaxy Note II users of a new app. Shortly after, Billboard said that the Samsung deal would not count towards the sales figures used by Nielsen SoundScan to compile their charts. The album was then released for retail sale three days later, on July 7, 2013.|$|E

500|$|Immediately upon {{signing the}} lease, Wagner invited the von Bülows and their {{children}} to stay with him. They spent the summer there, returning briefly to Munich before von Bülow left for Basel while Cosima went back to Tribschen. By now von Bülow understood his wife's relationship with Wagner; he wrote to a friend that [...] "since February 1865 I was in absolutely {{no doubt about the}} extremely peculiar nature of the situation". [...] Wagner, anxious to avoid associating Cosima in a public scandal, deceived Ludwig into issuing a statement in June 1866 which declared the unbroken sanctity of the von Bülows' marriage, and promised retribution for those daring to suggest otherwise. By this time Cosima was pregnant with her second child by Wagner; a daughter, Eva, was born at Tribschen on 17 February 1867. <b>Through</b> <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> von Bülow retained his devotion to Wagner's music. He had been appointed music director of the Munich Hofoper, and threw himself into the preparations for the premiere of Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg. This took place on 21 June 1868 under his baton, and was a great success. Shortly afterwards, Cosima rejoined Wagner at Tribschen; Wagner explained to the king that she could not bear the insults to which she was continually subjected in Munich, and wished to escape from the world.|$|E

[...] The N and its related Norwich Line steamers (passenger and freight) made money, enough that the NY could afford to pay 8% (reduced from 10% by negotiation ca. 1885) on the N's capital stock.|$|E

He managed a budget of about $13 million and nothing made him prouder than the doubling of the state's cash balance during his tenure. Social changes increasingly challenged the old fashioned [...] "blue laws." [...] When the General Assembly demonstrated reluctance to revise them, the State Attorney General, James R. Morford, ordered some 500 people across the state arrested for various Sabbath offenses. After the arrestees' names appeared in local newspapers, the laws began to change.|$|E

They {{claimed that the}} filmmakers had violated {{the conditions under which}} they were given permission to film inside the prison. They claimed they had been screened a shorter version of the documentary and also said that they asked the producers to delete the interview with the convict. [...] Udwin denied this saying that she had submitted 16 hours of “raw, unedited footage”, but the review committee told her after watching three hours of it, “We can’t sit <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> it’s too long.” [...] She said that she then submitted an edited version that was cleared. On 5 March Udwin left India, presumably to avoid legal action.|$|E

In the tape, recorded hours before she agreed to the plea in court, Fisher could be seen talking about her future, saying that she wanted to get married to Makely so he could visit her in prison. Fisher explained that her lawyer believed requiring people to be married for such visits was unconstitutional, and that she intended to challenge the law on this matter. Fisher could be seen on the tape saying: [...] "That will keep my name in the press. I want my name in the press. Why? Because I can make a lot of money.

Yet Ludlow was earnest in his description of the horrors of withdrawal, adding that “f, from a human distaste of dwelling too long upon the horrible, I have been led to speak so lightly of the facts of this part of my experience that any man may think the returning way of ascent an easy one, and dare the downward road of ingress, I would repair the fault with whatever of painfully-elaborated prophecy of wretchedness may be in my power, for <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> time I was indeed a greater sufferer than any bodily pain could possibly make me.” ...|$|E

2500|$|When Sitting Bull {{heard that}} Grouard was Crook's Chief Scout, {{he saw an}} {{opportunity}} to kill him in battle. By March 17, 1876, Grouard had located Crazy Horse's village on Powder River in Montana. He followed the trail left by two hostiles, who had been spotted the previous day, all through the night, even when their tracks were covered during a snowstorm. General Crook, in his May 1876 report wrote, [...] "I would sooner lose a third of my command than Frank Grouard!" [...] Other scouts, jealous of Crook's preference for Grouard, tried to turn the General against him by claiming that Grouard had joined up as a scout in order to lead the Army into a carefully orchestrated trap, but Crook saw <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>this.</b> On occasions when scouting Grouard would dress as an Indian so that genuine Indians would take no notice of him. Thus, Grouard could pass as an American and an American Indian.|$|E
2500|$|The {{step from}} optics to {{dynamics}} {{in the application}} of the method of [...] "Varying Action" [...] was made in 1827, and communicated to the Royal Society, in whose Philosophical Transactions for 1834 and 1835 there are two papers on the subject, which, like the [...] "Systems of Rays," [...] display a mastery over symbols and a flow of mathematical language almost unequaled. The common thread running <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> work is Hamilton's principle of [...] "Varying Action". Although {{it is based on the}} calculus of variations and may be said to belong to the general class of problems included under the principle of least action which had been studied earlier by Pierre Louis Maupertuis, Euler, Joseph Louis Lagrange, and others, Hamilton's analysis revealed much deeper mathematical structure than had been previously understood, in particular the symmetry between momentum and position. Paradoxically, the credit for discovering the quantity now called the Lagrangian and Lagrange's equations belongs to Hamilton. Hamilton's advances enlarged greatly the class of mechanical problems that could be solved, and they represent perhaps the greatest addition which dynamics had received since the work of Isaac Newton and Lagrange. Many scientists, including Liouville, Jacobi, Darboux, Poincaré, Kolmogorov, and Arnold, have extended Hamilton's work, thereby expanding our knowledge of mechanics and differential equations.|$|E
2500|$|Smith's various projects, {{starting}} with a mortgage taken to purchase his estate at Tucking Mill in Somerset in 1798, accrued financial commitments that ran {{into a series of}} difficulties which he managed to withstand by borrowing money from sympathetic creditors and mortgagors and funding repayments by taking on a relentless schedule of work commissions between 1801 and 1819. However a project to quarry Bath Stone near his property, for sale to the London property development market, failed to return the significant investment it had required due to poor quality stone and Smith found himself in default to co-investor Charles Conolly. [...] Smith had used his Bath estate as security against Conolly's loan but there was excess to pay. In attempting to stave off his debt Smith sold his 'fossil collection' to the British Museum for £700, but this proved insufficient and funds fell short of the sum owed to Conolly by £300 and as a consequence Smith was sent to debtor's prison in 1819. <b>Through</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> financial turmoil, Smith managed to publish his map and subsequent associated publications but in 1817 he remarked [...] "My income is as yet not anywise improved by what has been done, the profits being required to liquidate the debt incurred by publication." ...|$|E
