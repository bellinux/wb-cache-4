5|$|Despite her injury, McLeod {{returned}} to the pitch quickly, starting in three games at the CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifier in February 2016 where she recorded two shutouts. On February 19, McLeod joined the national team for their semifinal match against Costa Rica. In the warmup for the game, she again injured her right knee and left the warmup early. However, she played all 90 minutes of the match. Following the tournament, she {{returned to}} Sweden to play with her club team, FC Rosengård. In March 2016, her knee collapsed after kicking a ball while playing with FC Rosengård. It was revealed that she had torn her ACL in her right knee for the third time. Later, her surgeon stated that the injury had most likely occurred in the warmup before Canada's match against Costa Rica. McLeod has stated that her recovery {{is expected to take}} one to two years and plans <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the field in February or March 2017.|$|E

25|$|In July 1924 when Arthur Dove and Helen Torr sailed into Huntington Harbor aboard their 42-foot yawl, Mona, {{they could}} not have {{anticipated}} the extent to which Long Island’s North Shore would inspire some of their greatest paintings. They lived in Halesite until the Great Depression when both Dove and Torr moved back to the Dove's estate located in Geneva. Longing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> Long Island, in 1938 they moved back into their first home, a former post office and general store on Center Shore Road in Centerport, New York. They purchased the house for $980.00. Their tiny, one-room cottage stood {{on the edge of the}} Titus Mill Pond. Almost immediately, Dove was found to have pneumonia; he eventually suffered from a heart attack and was diagnosed with a debilitating kidney disorder. In terrible health for the remainder of his days, he lived quietly, finally about to devote himself entirely to painting, and focusing on the inspiration of his surroundings and his home. Some of the most powerful paintings of his career, including Indian Summer, were painted in Centerport. Torr remained in the house on the millpond but never painted again. After her death in 1967, works by Torr and Dove were hung together in The Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1979.|$|E
25|$|The final protest {{march was}} {{permitted}} for 2:00 to 5:00p.m. {{on the final}} day of the convention. This meant that the last of the marchers needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> capitol grounds by 5p.m. By 4p.m., the march had still not left the capitol grounds. Understanding that the protesters were interested in being near the Xcel Energy Center when delegates were, police offered a compromise: march leaders were told that if they started their march before 5p.m., police would allow it to continue past the permit time. March organizers refused. When the final protest march permit expired at 5p.m., overpasses over Interstate 94 leading into downtown from the state capitol were closed. Two hours later, when the final assembly permit on capitol grounds expired and protesters refused several commands to disperse, police used tear gas, smoke bombs, pepper spray, flash bangs, mounted police, paint marker rounds, and rubber bullets to prevent an antiwar march organized by the Anti-War Committee to march on the Xcel Energy center. This march would have been in violation of the court-approved march permits. Between 300 and 400 people were arrested or held including 19 journalists, among them AP reporters Amy Forliti and Jon Krawczynski, reporters from Twin Cities Daily Planet and The Uptake, and Paul Demko of The Minnesota Independent. Total arrests of convention protesters numbered approximately 800, although only 15 cases resulted in criminal charges. Several suits were started in U.S. District Court, claiming civil rights abuses by the St. Paul Police Department and other agencies involved in the RNC, particularly the Minneapolis Police Department and Ramsey County Sheriff's Office. Search warrants were still being granted into 2009 in relation to the events that transpired during the 2008 RNC.|$|E

[...] Schultz was pleased <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> Star Trek, and was surprised to be considered for a Voyager guest appearance. [...] On meeting Robert Picardo, he recalled they spent their time joking with each other on set, discussing mutual friends, and comparing notes on their theatre experiences.

500|$|Following the race, Démare {{expressed}} delight at his victory, saying: [...] "There {{are days}} {{like this one}} in which everything works despite the occasional hiccup, like crashing {{at the bottom of the}} Cipressa. I made it across at the bottom of the Poggio and the entire way I felt fantastic. [...] This is a big one and has been running for over a century. It's extraordinary. I'm extremely happy." [...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in front of me. That was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E

In December 2010, she had an Achilles injury. [...] She sustained the injury playing in Australia. Between January 2011 and February 2012, she had surgeries to assist with Achilles and hip injuries. She had surgery on her left hip acetabular labrum in June 2011 in Vail, Colorado at the Richard Steadman Clinic. [...] She said of the surgery: [...] "This is a really, really tough decision, but after talking with my doctors and my family, we felt that immediate surgery is {{the best course of}} action. With something painful like this hip injury, I want to be especially proactive. I plan to stay in Seattle to be here with my team and try my best <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the court as soon as possible. My goal is to be at full strength {{by the end of the}} season." [...] She did rehab twice a day in an attempt to speed recovery. Afterwards, Jackson injured her right knee, requiring surgery in 2012. Another knee injury while playing in China in 2014 degraded into arthritis and required many surgical intervention in the following years, including a hospitalization in January 2016 once the operated knee joint got infected. All the consequences of this knee problem lead to Jackson's retirement in March. Jackson has expressed interest in undergoing a knee reconstruction, as [...] "I don't want to walk with a limp for the rest of my life." ...|$|E

[...] This came about as a result of stalled negotiations between Abdul and the show. On August 4, 2009, after numerous contract negotiations, Abdul confirmed that she would not be returning to Idol for its ninth season. The Times cited reports Abdul had been earning as much as $5 million per season and that she was reportedly seeking as much as $20 million to return. Abdul was replaced by Ellen DeGeneres.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the last}} week of February, Clinton's {{campaign}} seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> its feet. A Saturday Night Live sketch mocked the media for its supposedly biased coverage in favor of Obama, and Clinton used the sketch to argue that Obama had not received proper scrutiny. The media responded by taking a more critical look at Obama's campaign. Meanwhile, Obama supporter and former fundraiser Tony Rezko went on trial in a political corruption case in Chicago. While Obama was not implicated, questions remained about how forthcoming he had been about his relationship with Rezko. Controversy also erupted when it was reported in the Canadian press that Obama economic advisor Austan Goolsbee had privately offered assurances that Obama's anti-North American Free Trade Agreement rhetoric on the campaign trail was exaggerated. Obama's campaign denied the substance of the report, but their response was muddled by a series of missteps and may have hurt the candidate's standing with Ohio voters. Clinton launched a five-point attack on Obama's qualifications, [...] "unleashing what one Clinton aide called a 'kitchen sink' fusillade," [...] according to The New York Times. Perhaps the most damaging component was a campaign ad that aired in Texas, using the imagery of the White House [...] "red phone" [...] to suggest that Obama would not be prepared to handle a crisis as commander-in-chief when a phone call comes into the White House at 3 a.m. The ad drew significant media attention in the four days before the election. [...] In the general-election campaign, McCain used parts of the ad against Obama.|$|E

It was first announced on 18 May 2009 that actress Leslie Ash had been cast in the role, after a five-year break from acting due to complications arising from MSSA. Ash commented that the role was the first she had had to audition for since the age of nineteen, and although nervous: [...] "I am so pleased and happy they've given me this chance. They are very brave to have taken on a disabled actress. I can't wait <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> set. It's the last piece of the jigsaw in my recovery. I'm finally back to where I was." [...] McHale commented: [...] "We're thrilled to have Leslie join us at Holby. We know she's going to be a terrific asset to the show and her character will bring another dimension to our already strong cast. Her stories are going to have our viewers guessing all the way." [...] Her first scenes were filmed in June 2009, for broadcast in October 2009. Asked how long she saw herself staying in Holby City, Ash replied: [...] "At the moment I’m really happy, so as long as they want me! I want it to go well so I can stay on. Also, I know there are lots of women out there who love this show and I don’t want them to be disappointed. I want them to say, 'She looks great!'".|$|E
