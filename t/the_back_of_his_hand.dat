In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key {{to the bottom of}} a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.|$|E

If I win, {{it will be because}} I {{have a little bit of}} luck and some of the others have trouble. I mean, Hannu Mikkola knows the forests like <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> so there is no use trying to drive to beat him. You have to wait for him to have trouble. Then you are in with a chance." ...|$|E
500|$|The out {{of control}} RV {{was created by the}} show's special effects coordinator, David Gauthier; an {{auxiliary}} steering wheel was rigged up in the vehicle so that the driver would be able to steer the car from the back window, out of the camera's sight. Wilson and Renna were fitted with faux vampire teeth – which were sardonically labeled [...] "funny fangs"—courtesy of special effects makeup coordinator Toby Lindala. Wilson later recounted that they fit comfortably in the actor's mouth, musing that [...] "the retainers I had to wear as a kid never fit as well." [...] In order to create the glowing green eyes, fluorescent material was glued to the actors' eyelids. However, because they were unable to see, this gave the vampires a [...] "somewhat vacant" [...] stare. The various corpses with fangs marks were created by makeup artist Laverne Basham. In order to create a suitable model, Gilligan bit <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to give Basham something to work with.|$|E

2500|$|About noon on July 17, Nolan met {{the buffalo}} hunters led by James Harvey. [...] One {{of the key}} players was the hunters' main guide Jose Piedad Tafoya, a former Comanchero. He knew the Llano like <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> but was weak in English. With other hunters helping, Tafoya talked to Nolan {{under the shade of}} a huge old pecan tree on Bull Creek which was [...] east of Muchaque Peak in Borden County, Texas. Nolan showed his orders to the hunters and despite an initial level of mistrust, they were willing to combine against a common enemy.|$|E
2500|$|Irvine {{has five}} tattoos, {{three of which}} are on his left hand. The first {{is the name of}} his wife, Jessica, which is tattooed on his ring finger. The second is the letter F, {{representing}} Fozzy, on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> which he had tattooed in June 2011. On September 12, 2012, Irvine got his third tattoo, the album artwork of Fozzy's fifth studio album, Sin and Bones, on his left arm. Irvine had his fourth tattoo, a Jack-o'-lantern, done on September 28, 2012. Avenged Sevenfold vocalist M. Shadows, who collaborated with Fozzy on the track [...] "Sandpaper" [...] from Sin and Bones, also got a matching tattoo. Jericho then got a self portrait tattoo on his left biceps in July 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Derek Donnell who was {{a lovely}} bloke played cricket as {{it was meant to}} be played [...] "Hard but Fair." [...] Derek served the Club as a Player, Official and President. Reg 'The Roge' Purslow who loved the ground almost as much as his wife and {{probably}} spent more time working down there than what he did at home. He was very popular in the Pub after the game where due to his extremely bad luck (his words) at the game of Spoof meant that he spent most of the evening paying for the beer. Reg served the Club as a 2nd XI Captain, Groundsman, Umpire and Secretary. Arthur 'The Wily Old Fox' probably the best spinner the Club ever had. He bowled leggers out of <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and even he did not know which way the ball would turn.|$|E

2500|$|Sylvan Barnet {{believes}} {{that in this}} adaptation, [...] "Kate and Petruchio fall in love {{almost as soon as}} they see each other." [...] Barbara Hodgdon has also pointed out that several times, Katherina can be seen gazing longingly at Petruchio. Critics have also noted that Katherina twice consciously makes the decision to go along with Petruchio. The first moment is behind the stained glass window, when she silently decides to marry him. The second is when she follows him after he leaves her at the gates of Padua. In this version, Katherina delivers her final speech seemingly without irony. Zeffirelli and Burton both wanted Elizabeth Taylor to deliver the speech ironically, a la Mary Pickford, but Taylor felt {{it would be better to}} speak seriously, and then undermine that seriousness by leaving the banquet without Petruchio, thus subverting his apparent authority over her. However, Elizabeth Schafer calls the film [...] "intensely conservative," [...] citing the controversial advertising blurb; [...] "A motion picture for every man who ever gave <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to his beloved...and for every woman who deserved it. Which takes in a lot of people! Russell Jackson argues the film [...] "offers a 1960s liberation more likely to appeal to Lawrentians than present-day feminists." [...] However, Schafer does go on to acknowledge that [...] "because of the sheer power of Taylor's presence, Katherina occupies a far more memorable filmic space than the dramatic space she has in the original play.|$|E
2500|$|... "Iqbal Qasim came in, {{a little}} left-hander. I {{chose to go}} round the wicket and {{obviously}} we put men round the bat, 'Brears' (Mike Brearley the captain) at first slip, Graham Roope, Bob Willis, 'Both' all round the bat. I just bowled it right and it was magic really; it just turned a fraction and bounced, and 'Iqqie' nicked it. Brears just dived to his left and caught the ball about a foot off the ground, landed in front of Roopey and Willis, Iqqie just looked up the wicket at me, nodded, said, 'Well bowled'; the umpire went bananas, shaking hands and saying, 'I've never seen a hat-trick before, well bowled.' And ironically this was on my debut. 12 months previously, on the same ground, Peter Petherick of New Zealand had just done the first hat-trick ever on debut, so {{it would have been}} 12 months to the day {{and it would have been}} a unique place in history." [...] "But Mike in landing got a lot of gravel on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> Iqqie left the field and all the lads were up there when suddenly Brears started saying, ‘I’m going to bring him back because I don't think I caught it cleanly.' All the lads around him were adamant he had caught it a foot off the ground, but he said, 'No, for the best interests of this series I'm going to bring him back.' So he brought him back – and for the best interests of the series, six of us were lbw in our first innings. It happened, but it was a moment of disappointment because something like that on a Test debut is very special. As somebody once said, 'If bad luck hadn't been invented, we'd have had none at all!'" ...|$|E
