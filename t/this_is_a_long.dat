25|$|The main {{drainage}} to {{the north}} of Sail runs to Coledale. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> uninhabited valley which exits into the floodplain of the Derwent at the village of Braithwaite. Near its head are two successive steps of crag, each bearing a waterfall. The southern flanks of the fell are drained by Sail Beck and its tributaries, flowing south west between the slopes of Wandope and Knott Rigg to Buttermere village. Sail thus stands on the main watershed of the North Western Fells, a virtue not shared by the higher Grasmoor.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, Wold started touring and {{performing}} with fellow blues musicians, and had {{friends in the}} music scene including Joni Mitchell. He spent time living in San Francisco. Since then, he has worked, on and off, as a session musician and studio engineer. In the late 1980s, while living in Olympia, near Seattle, he worked with many indie label artists. In the 1990s he continued {{to work as a}} recording engineer and producer, producing several releases by Modest Mouse including their 1996 debut album <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Long</b> Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About.|$|E
25|$|Scarth Gap can {{be gained}} {{from the head of}} Ennerdale, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> walk from {{anywhere}} except Black Sail Youth Hostel. Scarth Gap provides the more regular approach from the Buttermere valley, parking being available at Gatesgarth. On the Buttermere side a path cuts off the corner {{at the top of the}} pass and removes the need to first ascend Seat, before the long assault on the screes of Gamlin End. From the shore of Buttermere Wainwright noted that an ascent may be made via Birkness Comb, climbing a grassy rake through the crags.|$|E

50|$|From {{around the}} time of Hadrian (r. 117-38), some {{auxiliary}} alae adopted the dragon-standard (draco) commonly carried by Sarmatian cavalry squadrons. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> cloth wind-sock attached to an ornate sculpture of an open dragon's mouth. When the bearer (draconarius) was galloping, it would make a strong hissing-sound.|$|R
25|$|The long through ball: <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> {{and usually}} high, pass from a teams' own half, {{over the heads}} of the other team's defence. It is {{intended}} for the attacking players to chase and it is important that they remain in an onside position until the ball is kicked. The tactic works best with strong and fast forwards who will have a good chance of winning back the ball, taking control over it, and eventually getting a shot on goal. In the diagram, the ball (red line) is played in front of the furthermost forward, the dotted blue line showing their run. In this example, a through-ball pass along the ground would be picked up by one of the defenders (black team) because the gap between the two central defenders is too small.|$|E

These men of nowhere—Faisal Shahzad, Nidal Malik Hasan, the American-born renegade cleric Anwar Awlaki now holed up in Yemen and their likes—are a deadly breed of combatants in this new kind of war. Modernity both attracts and unsettles them. America is at once the object of their dreams, and the scapegoat onto which they project their deepest malignancies.|$|E

30|$|In our study, all {{patients}} {{were treated with}} antibiotics before and after surgery.

The international guidelines suggested a single dose of antibiotics for mild appendicitis, and a 5 – 7  days antibiotics prescription for advanced appendititis (Bratzler and Hunt 2006; Sartelli et al. 2013; Solomkin et al. 2010). Some studies even pointed out that 3  days of antibiotics treatment was equally effective as 5  days (van Rossem et al. 2014; Reibetanz and Germer 2014). The current situation of long antibiotic treatment in our hospital should attract our attentions.|$|R

How far, in their inverted culture, had these West Africans gone beyond phallic knowledge? Very, very far. Birkin recalled again the female figure: the elongated, long, long body, the curious unexpected heavy buttocks, he long, imprisoned neck, the face with tiny features like a beetle's. This was far beyond any phallic knowledge, sensual subtle realities far beyond the scope of phallic investigation.|$|E

Consequently we can only do justice to Mr. Collins's system, if we compare example after example of his supposed instances of Shakespeare's borrowing. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and irksome task; and the only fair plan is for the reader to peruse Mr. Collins's Studies in Shakespeare, compare the Greek and Roman texts, and weigh each example of supposed borrowing for himself.
