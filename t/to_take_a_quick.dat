5|$|A counterattack to {{take back}} the {{airfield}} and Point 107 was organised for the following day at Hargest's headquarters. He was exhausted and had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> nap before a conference to work out detailed plans for the counter-attack, much to the disgust of some of the other participants. Afterwards, he became pessimistic of the chances of success and unsuccessfully sought to have the attack called off. The attack did fail but Hargest, still well behind the frontlines, mistakenly believed it to be going well until he found that his brigade had returned to their starting positions. His pessimism began to affect Puttick, who asked Freyberg to allow the 5th Infantry Brigade to withdraw, which it duly did. This began an eventual retreat and evacuation from Crete on 31 May, with Hargest flying out for Egypt by seaplane, his brigade following by sea.|$|E
5|$|Between July 1 and July 12, 1916, {{five people}} were {{attacked}} {{along the coast}} of New Jersey by sharks; only one of the victims survived. The first major attack occurred on Saturday, July 1 at Beach Haven, a resort town established on Long Beach Island off the southern coast of New Jersey. Charles Epting Vansant, 25, of Philadelphia was on vacation at the Engleside Hotel with his family. Before dinner, Vansant decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> swim in the Atlantic with a Chesapeake Bay Retriever that was playing on the beach. Shortly after entering the water, Vansant began shouting. Bathers believed he was calling to the dog, but a shark was actually biting Vansant's legs. He was rescued by lifeguard Alexander Ott and bystander Sheridan Taylor, who claimed the shark followed him to shore as they pulled the bleeding Vansant from the water. Vansant's left thigh was stripped of its flesh; he bled to death on the manager's desk of the Engleside Hotel at 6:45p.m.|$|E
25|$|On {{the fourth}} {{afternoon}} of the Fourth Test, the Indian batting collapsed, and Australia {{had an opportunity to}} bowl them out and chase a target of around 250–300 after the tea break. However, the Australians were a long way behind on their over rate, so in order to avoid a one match suspension, Ponting chose to bowl their part-time spinners and medium pacers such as Michael Clarke, Cameron White and Mike Hussey (who were all unsuccessful in capturing a wicket), as they took less time. In the meantime, captain MS Dhoni and Harbhajan both added half centuries. This drew strong criticism from many commentators, who suggested that their faster bowlers, who had been responsible for the collapse, could have bowled from a shorter run-up. When the fast bowlers were reintroduced, the last four wickets fell quickly. This left Australia with 382 runs for victory and Ponting fell cheaply after attempting <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> single down the ground and being run out by a direct hit from Mishra at the non-striker's end. Australia lost by 172 runs to cede the series 2–0. In the first innings, Ponting became Harbhajan's 300th Test wicket. He ended the series with 264 runs at 37.71. While below his career standards, it was substantially better than his previous Test efforts in India.|$|E
25|$|Five {{infantry}} battalions, three {{field artillery}} batteries, and six garrison artillery batteries moved by sea from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to St. John, New Brunswick, then overland by sleigh from St. John to Riviere du Loup, Province of Canada, between January 1, 1862 and March 13, 1862. The 10-day-long overland passage, and the railway from Riviere du Loup to Ville du Quebec, was within a day's {{march of the}} border (in some locations, the overland trail was almost within rifle shot from U.S. territory in Maine), so the British staff planned on deploying infantry to defend the road, if necessary. The 96th Regiment, travelling on the Calcutta, reached New Brunswick in February; the other half were forced to abandon their voyage in the Azores when their ship, the Victoria, nearly sank. The Headquarters staff, who landed in Halifax on 5 January 1862 after the crisis was over, decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> route <b>to</b> Montreal and, covering up their military baggage labels to disguise their identities, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> Cunard steamer <b>to</b> Boston from where they caught the railway to Montreal.|$|R

5000|$|In {{contemporary}} usage ala breve suggests <b>a</b> fairly <b>quick</b> tempo. Thus, {{it is used}} frequently {{for military}} marches.

With Singh still in his crease he was given not out, but Indian captain Rahul Dravid decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> run in the confusion as the ball ricocheted away; Paul Collingwood acted quickly though, and grabbed the ball and ran it into the remaining two stumps and bail just as Dravid {{made it to the}} crease.

2500|$|Game 1 of the NLDS ended an 11–6 Philadelphia victory. After Roy Halladay {{struggled}} in the first, allowing {{a three-run homer}} to Lance Berkman, he settled down, at one point retiring twenty-one Cardinal hitters in a row. After Game 1, Chris Carpenter, starting on three-day's rest {{for the first time}} in his career, allowed the Phillies <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> 4–0 lead in Game 2. And with Cliff Lee on the mound for the Phils, the game seemed out of reach. [...] "You can count on one finger the number of times you'll come back from four runs down against Cliff Lee", Lance Berkman said. That's exactly what the Cardinals did, and took a 5–4 lead after an RBI single by Albert Pujols. The series was tied at one game apiece. [...] "That win was huge for us", Tony La Russa said. [...] "Realistically, us winning three in a row was not really possible." [...] The famous Rally Squirrel (aka, 'Busch Squirrel'), made his first appearance in Game 3 on October 4, and then again appeared in Game 4 on October 5, running across Home Plate at Busch Stadium in front of Skip Schumaker who was batting. The pitch was called a ball, and Roy Oswalt protested that it should not have counted. Nothing he did changed the umpire's mind though. Schumaker later flew out to left. The team was ahead at the time, 3–2, and held on for the 5–3 victory. The Rally Squirrel was instantly adopted by the fans as the postseason mascot, and thousands of rally squirrel T-shirts were sold. His Twitter account started, and by October 6 it had over 11,000 followers; by October 20, it had over 27,500 [...]|$|E

40|$|While {{this chapter}} will not present a {{detailed}} history of monetary policy, {{it is useful}} <b>to</b> first <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> look at the evolution {{of thinking about the}} nature of monetary policy. We will first examine the famous Currency School-Banking School debates of the early 19 th century, then turn to the insightful analysis of Walter Bagehot. We next turn {{to the creation of the}} Fed and early 20 th century thinking about the role of the central bank. The discovery of the “deposit multiplier ” in the 1920 s as well as the developing understanding of open market operations had a very large influence on the post-WWII theory of central bank control of the money supply. While post-war “Keynesian” economists were skeptical of the potency of monetary policy, the Monetarist approach gradually gained adherents and came completely to dominate thinking about monetary policy by the last quarter of the 20 th century. However, Monetarism experienced a quite remarkable turn-around of fortunes at the end of the century. As we begin the 21 st century, orthodox thinking about monetary policy is in nearly complete disarray. However...|$|R

He abruptly left the trail, and, breaking into a run, went through the woods as fleetly and noiselessly as a deer, running {{for a quarter of}} a mile, when he stopped to listen. All seemed well, for he lowered his head, and walked slowly along, examining the moss and leaves. Presently he came upon a little open space where the soil was a sandy loam. He bent over, then rose quickly. He had come upon the Indian's trail. Cautiously he moved forward, stopping every moment to listen. In all the close pursuits of his maturer years he had never been a victim of that most cunning of Indian tricks, an ambush. He relied solely on his ear to learn if foes were close by. The wild creatures of the forest were his informants. As soon as he heard any change in their twittering, humming or playing--whichever way they manifested their joy or fear of life--he became as hard to see, as difficult to hear as a creeping snake.|$|E

Their future is {{threatened}} by Bill's declining health, Marcella's alcoholism, and the struggles of Channe and Billy to adapt to American high school. Billy, awkward and very reserved, is bullied at school. Channe drifts from boy to boy giving sex in exchange for acceptance until she falls for Keith, a fellow student who becomes her steady boyfriend. Immersed {{in the writing of}} a new novel, Bill is worried about the future of his family when he would be gone. The irregularity of Billy's adoption comes to haunt him. The boy's biological mother had him at fifteen from a relationship with a cousin and wrote a diary while pregnant.

5000|$|Novel feeding {{techniques}} were observed during {{a study of}} five individually identified minke whales (named M1 to M5) in the Saguenay Fjord National Park, {{on the north side}} of the St. Lawrence estuary, from June to October 2003. These maneuvers included head slaps, chip-up blows, and exhales on the dive. During a head slap, the whale would raise its head high out of the water at angle of about 30 <b>to</b> 45°, <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> breath, and then slam its head onto the water, creating a loud splash. It would do this without expanding its ventral pleats or forcing water out of its mouth. After doing several head slaps the whale would perform a feeding lunge. Head slaps were used almost exclusively by M4 and M5. A chin-up blow is similar to a normal surfacing but more energetic and executed at a greater angle as the whale comes high out of the water to breathe and dive again in one continuous motion without slapping the surface of the water. Chin-up blows were utilized often and performed by all five whales; it was the principal technique used by M1, M2, and M3 prior to a feeding lunge. An exhale on the dive is exactly what its name implies: a whale exhaling as its blowholes submerge. This resulted in a large volume of water being displaced and typically followed a normal blow or a chin-up blow and on occasion a head slap. This technique was only executed by M1 and M5. These new techniques are thought to have been developed by these whales to help them herd small schooling fish (likely capelin) in the well-mixed waters of the Saguenay Fjord; these tactics were not observed in the nearby Laurentian Channel Head, where [...] "strong tidal currents, a stratified water column and bottom topography combine to create large areas of upwelling in which prey are forced to the surface".|$|R
