Before the treatability study can be initiated, the proposed activity must be subjected to an Operational <b>Readiness</b> <b>Review</b> (ORR). ORR is a structured methodology of determining readiness to proceed as outlined in Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc.

40|$|Abstract. Since {{the advent}} of {{applying}} Agile [1] practices on DoD projects, specifi-cally Scrum [2] practices, the burning question asked by many has been, “How does Agile integrate with Waterfall [3] milestones?” Agile development is by definition incremental, meaning major functionality is com-pleted and demonstrated to the customer, users, and other stakeholders at specified releases and {{through a series of}} short, scheduled iterations (or sprints). Waterfall projects rely on completing all requirements by the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) milestone, completing all design by the Critical Design Review (CDR) milestone, and completing product development by the <b>Test</b> <b>Readiness</b> <b>Review</b> (TRR) milestone. Some success has been made to abate this issue by breaking the typical waterfall-based milestone reviews into multiple interim reviews enabled by the flex-ibility in the DoD 5000 acquisition regulation requirements. Interim reviews reflect the iterative nature of Agile as they can be held more frequently and with tighter focus than the traditional days-long milestone reviews. This article presents an approach that uses surveillance points throughout the proj-ect lifecycle as the basis for technical interchange meetings (TIMS) each of which includes a demonstration and review of completed functionality that can be deployed as an operational component of the final product. When deployed into the targeted domain, users are encouraged to provide reflections of product usage in the form of feedback to the project team in real time...|$|E
40|$|The General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) is an {{open-source}} space mission design, {{analysis and}} trajectory optimization tool. GMAT is {{developed by a}} team of NASA, private industry, public and private contributors. GMAT is designed to model, optimize and estimate spacecraft trajectories in flight regimes ranging from low Earth orbit to lunar applications, interplanetary trajectories and other deep space missions. GMAT has also been flight qualified to support operational maneuver planning for the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) mission. ACE was launched in August, 1997 and is orbiting the Sun-Earth L 1 libration point. The primary science objective of ACE is to study the composition of both the solar wind and the galactic cosmic rays. Operational orbit determination, maneuver operations and product generation for ACE are conducted by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Flight Dynamics Facility (FDF). This paper discusses the entire engineering lifecycle and major operational certification milestones that GMAT successfully completed to obtain operational certification for the ACE mission.

40|$|In July of 1996, the Industrial Hygiene Team of the Environmental Management Office at NASA Lewis Research Center was {{contacted}} by the Space Station Program Office to conduct ammonia awareness training for a team of engineers and technicians. The team was tasked with assembling and operating an ammonia handling system for testing of a photovoltaic radiator at the NASA Plum Brook Station Space Power Facility. The ammonia handling system supports a radiator designed to radiate excess heat from a photovoltaic array module used to provide power to the International Space Station. The system would consist of a hazardous materials trailer equipped with an anhydrous ammonia tank, heater, accumulator, chiller, and flow bench. Meetings were held with representatives from the Space Station Program Office, the engineers and Plum Brook safety personnel. Guidance was also provided by representatives from Kennedy Space Center. Determinations were made concerning the locations and types of potential exposures and a plan was developed which included training, personal protective equipment, engineering controls and emergency response. Various organizations including the Plum Brook Safety Committee, the Lewis Environmental Management Office, the <b>Test</b> <b>Readiness</b> <b>Review</b> Board and the Program Office all had requirements {{that had to be}} met in order to satisfy themselves that all personnel involved in the operation of the system would be safe.

40|$|As {{a member}} of the Space Suit Assembly Development Engineering Team, I {{designed}} and built test equipment systems to support the development of the next generation of advanced space suits. During space suit testing it is critical to supply the subject with two functions: (1) cooling to remove metabolic heat, and (2) breathing air to pressurize the space suit. The objective of my first project was to design, build, and certify an improved Space Suit Cooling System for manned testing in a 1 G environment. This design had to be portable and supply a minimum cooling rate of 2500 BTU/hr. The Space Suit Cooling System is a robust, portable system that supports very high metabolic rates. It has a highly adjustable cool rate and is equipped with digital instrumentation to monitor the flowrate and critical temperatures. It can supply a variable water temperature down to 34 deg., and it can generate a maximum water flowrate of 2. 5 LPM. My next project was to design and build a Breathing Air System that was capable of supply facility air to subjects wearing the Z 2 space suit. The system intakes 150 PSIG breathing air and regulates it to two operating pressures: 4. 3 and 8. 3 PSIG. It can also provide structural capabilities at 1. 5 x operating pressure: 6. 6 and 13. 2 PSIG, respectively. It has instrumentation to monitor flowrate, as well as inlet and outlet pressures. The system has a series of relief valves to fully protect itself in case of regulator failure. Both projects followed a similar design methodology. The first task was to perform research on existing concepts to develop a sufficient background knowledge. Then mathematical models were developed to size components and simulate system performance. Next, mechanical and electrical schematics were generated and presented at Design Reviews. After the systems were approved by the suit team, all the hardware components were specified and procured. The systems were then packaged, fabricated, and thoroughly tested. The next step was to certify the equipment for manned used, which included generating a Hazard Analysis and giving a presentation to the <b>Test</b> <b>Readiness</b> <b>Review</b> Board. Both of these test support systems will perform critical roles in the development of nextgeneration space suits. They will used on a regular basis to test the NASA's new Z 2 Space Suit.
