5|$|Though {{during the}} 1970s most of Sierra Highway was {{bypassed}} by freeways and expressways, the old two-lane road remained a famous roadway. In 1971, Steven Spielberg {{made his first}} feature-length film, Duel, along Sierra Highway, near Acton. The film is about an unseen truck driver who stalks and attempts to kill an innocent motorist trapped in the truck's game. It prominently shows the desert portions of Sierra Highway. With Duels status, one of the trucks used in the film {{is still on the}} road and {{in the process of being}} restored. The current owner has driven the truck along Sierra Highway for nostalgia, enjoying <b>the</b> <b>terrified</b> looks he receives from passing motorists who recognize it. Other movies have since been filmed in the vicinity, including scenes in The Terminator.|$|E
5|$|Uttanka {{then saw}} two {{beautiful}} women weaving with {{white and black}} threads on a wheel fixed on the wall. The wheel had twelve spokes and was being turned by six young people. A horse with a rider stood near the wheel. Uttanka praised {{the functioning of the}} weaving process, the rider and the horse, and equated the rider to Indra. Pleased with this praise, the rider asked Uttanka to state in what way he could help him. Uttanka requested that he be given the power to bring the snakes under his control. The rider then instructed Uttanka to blow {{at the back of the}} horse. Uttanka did as suggested. Then flames emerged from all parts of the horse's body and filled the realm of the serpents with fire and smoke. <b>The</b> <b>terrified</b> Takshaka came out of hiding and gave up the earrings to Uttanka.|$|E

25|$|As {{the company}} made for Rivendell, the realm of Elrond Half-elven, they met Glorfindel, who loaned Frodo his horse, Asfaloth. Pursued by all nine Nazgûl, the horse carried Frodo across the Bruinen. From the far bank, Frodo defied the Nazgûl. When the Witch-king rode into the water, Elrond, who {{controlled}} the river, released a flood that caught three Nazgûl and their horses. Glorfindel advanced and drove <b>the</b> <b>terrified</b> horses of the remaining Nazgûl into the flood. The horses drowned and all nine Nazgûl were swept away.|$|E
25|$|Shortly, about 100 Interahamwe militiamen {{came into}} the church and began to kill people, {{striking}} with their clubs and slashing with their machetes, hacking arms, legs, genitals and the faces of <b>the</b> <b>terrified</b> people who tried to protect the children under the pews. Some people were dragged outside the church and attacked in the courtyard. The identity cards of the murdered ones were burned. The killing continued for two hours after which the whole compound was searched. The militia then left the church compound.|$|E
25|$|Several {{cautious}} probing {{attacks by}} the German naval infantry, Danzig SS and police and Wehrmacht were again repulsed by the Poles; at 0300 on 6 Sept., {{during one of}} these attacks, they sent a burning train against the land bridge, but this failed when <b>the</b> <b>terrified</b> driver decoupled too early. It failed to reach the oil cistern and set ablaze the forest, valuable for cover. The flaming wagons gave a perfect field of fire and the Germans suffered heavy losses. A second fire-train attack came in the afternoon but it too failed.|$|E

25|$|Of {{the twenty}} {{who survived the}} sinking, only one was a female. Anna Boecker was a shy, quiet maid in the {{employment}} of an elderly lady, travelling with her employer to Southampton. In the panic and confusion of the collision she had been unable to save her employer. She joined <b>the</b> <b>terrified</b> crush of passengers lowered into the first lifeboat. When it capsized under the sheer weight of numbers, Anna ended up in the ocean. All the others from her lifeboat clambered back onto the sinking ship. Anna was alone in the treacherous sea until the survivors in the second lifeboat spotted her foundering in the water and pulled her up to safety.|$|E
25|$|Refusing {{to listen}} to Drayton, Norton heads outside {{with a small group}} to seek help, only to be {{attacked}} and killed, prompting the rest of the survivors to barricade the shop-front windows. That night, enormous insects land on and attach themselves to the windows. Moments later, pterodactyl-like animals ram their beaks into the glass, eventually breaking through the windows and allowing the creatures to enter the supermarket. They begin to attack <b>the</b> <b>terrified</b> people inside and kill Sally, a cashier from the store. One of the insects lands on Mrs. Carmody, but doesn't sting her because she keeps still during her prayer. As a result, she starts preaching even more and quickly gains followers among the distraught survivors.|$|E
25|$|Jack {{has lost}} his {{seafaring}} father on board the Kyleclare, sunk by a U-boat on this same route, and goes to sea to support his family. His innate decency makes him join in this dangerous rescue of members of a navy whom he passionately hates for having killed his father. He comes to see <b>the</b> <b>terrified</b> German survivors not {{as part of a}} vicious murder machine but as shivering, wounded individuals, some little older than him, caught in a war that is not of their own making. The novel is premised around a view that The Kerlogue’s crew obeyed an unwritten code to save any lives they could. In risking their lives, they recognised the drowning Germans not are combatants, but as fellow sailors and honoured what sailors traditionally believe the initials SOS stand for: “Save our Souls”.|$|E

25|$|But Philip, now 60 {{years of}} age, died before the Bastarnae could arrive. The Bastarnae host was still en route through Thrace, where it became embroiled in {{hostilities}} with the locals, who were unable (or unwilling) {{to provide them}} with sufficient food at affordable prices as they marched through. Probably in the vicinity of Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv, Bulgaria), the Bastarnae broke out of their marching columns and pillaged the land far and wide. <b>The</b> <b>terrified</b> local Thracians took refuge with their families and animal herds on the slopes of Mons Donuca, the highest mountain in Thrace (Mt. Musala, Rila Mts., Bulgaria). A large force of Bastarnae chased them up the mountain, but were driven back and scattered by a massive hailstorm. Then the Thracians ambushed them, turning their descent into a panic-stricken rout. Back at their wagon-laager in the plain, around half the demoralised Bastarnae decided to return home, leaving c. 30,000 to press on to Macedonia.|$|E
25|$|After the British {{successfully}} occupied Manila {{and surrounding}} suburbs in 1762–1764 during the Seven Years' War, the colonial government led by Simón de Anda y Salazar fled to Bacolor, Pampanga through Polo. The British followed Anda, {{and at one}} point stayed in sitio Mabolo while waiting for orders from Governor Dawsonne Drake. They explored the nearby communities of Malanday, Wakas, Dalandanan, Pasolo, Rincon and Malinta. <b>The</b> <b>terrified</b> local population fled and sought refuge in the forests of Viente Reales where many of them died of malaria. The British then proceed to Malolos, Bulacan where they were ambushed by the stationed Spanish soldiers. After the chase, the local population of Polo returned to their homes on May 12, 1763 after days of reconstruction. Today, May 12 every year is celebrated as the feast of St. Roch, or San Roque, another patron saint, and as a memorial to those who died in the Seven Years' War.|$|E
25|$|At {{the fall}} of Napoleon in 1814, Lays {{was one of the}} Emperor's most {{prominent}} favourites, so when the allied armies entered Paris under the leadership of Tsar Alexander I, he was understandably worried about his own future. On 2 April, Talleyrand ordered the Opéra to mount a performance in honour of the tsar. The opera chosen, Le triomphe de Trajan by Persuis and Lesueur, had originally been given in 1807 to celebrate Napoleon's return to the capital. Not wanting to hurt the French public's feelings, Alexander requested a staging of Spontini's La vestale instead, an opera in which Lays always assumed the role of Cinna. At the end of the performance, the angry audience forced Lays – still dressed in his Roman toga – to return to the stage and recite some popular verses thanking the tsar for restoring the Bourbons. According to the brothers Michaud, Alexander was moved to compassion by the sight of <b>the</b> <b>terrified</b> singer and sent one of his aides-de-camp on stage to reassure him.|$|E

25|$|Departing {{from the}} Roman {{military}} tradition of engaging {{the enemy in}} pitched battle as soon as possible, Fabius invented the Fabian strategy: refusing open battle with his opponent, but constantly skirmishing with small detachments of the enemy. This course was not popular among the soldiers, earning Fabius the nickname Cunctator ("delayer"), since he seemed to avoid battle while Italy was being ravaged by the enemy. Moreover, it was widely feared that, if Hannibal continued to plunder Italy unopposed, <b>the</b> <b>terrified</b> allies, believing that Rome was incapable of protecting them, might defect and pledge their allegiance to the Carthaginians. As a countermeasure, residents of villages were encouraged to post lookouts, {{so that they could}} gather their livestock and possessions in time and take refuge in fortified towns that the enemy could not yet take. Fabius' policy was to shadow Hannibal by moving on the heights parallel to the Carthaginian movements on the plains, to avoid Hannibal's cavalry which was supreme on flat terrain. This demanded great care, since the Carthaginian tried with all his skill to ambush the Romans. For this reason, a new marching formation, with three parallel columns of infantry, was developed instead of the single column that had been in use at Lake Trasimene.|$|E
25|$|The {{high rate}} of {{mortality}} among the clergy naturally led to a shortage of priests {{in many parts of}} the country. The clergy were seen to have an elevated status among ordinary people and this was partly due to their closeness with God, being his envoys on earth. However, as the church itself had given the cause of the Black Death to be the impropriety of the behaviour of men, the higher death rate among the clergy led the people to lose faith in the Church as an institution − it had proved as ineffectual against the horror of Y. Pestis as every other medieval institution. The corruption within the Catholic priesthood also angered the English people. Many priests abandoned <b>the</b> <b>terrified</b> people. Others sought benefits from the rich families who needed burials. The dissatisfaction led to anti-clericalism and the rise of John Wycliffe, an English priest. His ideas paved a path for the Christian reformation in England. Some people didn't lose their Christian faith, if anything it was renewed; they began to long for a more personal relationship with God − around the time after the Black Death many chantries (private chapels) began to spread in use from not just the nobility, but to among the well to do. This change in the power of the papacy in England is demonstrated by the statutes of Praemunire.|$|E
