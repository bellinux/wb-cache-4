5|$|As it {{had become}} evident that the Aouzou Strip was being used by Libya {{as a base for}} deeper {{involvement}} in Chad, Malloum decided to bring the issue of the Strip's occupation before the UN and the Organisation of African Unity. Malloum also decided he needed new allies; he negotiated a formal alliance with Habré, the Khartoum Accord, in September. This accord was kept secret until 22 January, when a Fundamental Charter was signed, following which a National Union Government was formed on 29 August 1978 with Habré as Prime Minister. The Malloum-Habré accord was actively promoted by Sudan and Saudi Arabia, both of which feared a radical Chad controlled by Gaddafi. The two nations saw in Habré, with his good Muslim and anti-colonialialist credentials, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>chance</b> to thwart Gaddafi's plans.|$|E
5|$|In a {{situation}} with more time, Virginia Tech would have kicked the ball off to Florida State and {{hoped for a}} defensive stop to give the offense {{a chance for a}} game-winning drive. With less than twominutes remaining, however, and with Virginia Tech having used all its timeouts, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>chance</b> for the Hokies was to attempt a difficult onside kick. A successful recovery would give the Hokies another chance on offense. Kicker Brandon Pace teed up the ball, and kicked it forwards, bouncing the ball high into the air to create a jump ball situation. Virginia Tech's Xavier Adibi recovered the ball, but because the kick had only traveled nineyards before the recovery, the ball was awarded to Florida State. NCAA rules state that an onside kick must travel at least 10yards before the kicking team can legally touch the ball, and Pace's kick had not traveled the requisite distance.|$|E

According to his obituary in the Guardian, he saw little action in the service and was told <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>chance</b> he would have to fly would be as a rear gunner. Some of his fellow airmen hounded Shaw for autographs while others mocked his posh accent, to which he retaliated with an excellent and unflattering imitation of their less refined speech.

5|$|Of the {{approximately}} 20 German infantry and armoured divisions {{trapped in the}} Falaise pocket around 12 were still operating {{with a degree of}} combat-effectiveness. As these formations retreated eastwards they fought desperately to keep the jaws of the encirclement—formed by the Canadians in Trun and St. Lambert, and the Poles and Americans in Chambois—from closing. German movement out of the pocket throughout the night of 19 August cut off the Polish battlegroups on the Mont Ormel ridge. On discovering this Stefanowicz conferred with Koszutski. Lacking sufficient means to either seal the pocket or fight their way clear, the two decided that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>chance</b> of survival for their force was to hold fast until relieved. Although the Polish soldiers on Point 262N could hear movement from the valley below, other than some mortar rounds that landed among the positions of the 8th Infantry Battalion the night passed uneventfully. Without possession of Point 262S the Poles were unable to interfere with the large numbers of German troops slipping past the southern slopes of the ridge. The uneven, wooded terrain, interspersed with thick hedgerows, made control of the ground to the west and southwest difficult by day and impossible by night. As it grew light on 20 August Szydłowski prepared to fulfil his orders of the previous day and organised two companies of his 9th Infantry Battalion, supported by the 1st Armoured Regiment, for an attack across the road towards Point 262S. However, hampered by the wreckage littering the pass the attack soon bogged down in the face of fierce German resistance.|$|E

25|$|The {{feeling that}} the early 20th century was an era of {{economic}} growth due to technological advances contrasted dramatically with {{the standard of living}} of lower social classes. The growth of the previous decades led to an unprecedented population explosion starting in 1929. The Great Depression caused the collapse of the nitrate industry in the north, leaving 60,000 unemployed, which added to the decline in agricultural exports, resulting in a total number for the unemployed to be about 300,000 nationwide. These unemployed workers saw Santiago and its booming industry as <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>chance</b> to survive. Many migrants arrived in Santiago with nothing and thousands had to survive on the streets due to the great difficulty in finding a place they could rent.

The development and deployment of equipment suitable for the accurate measurement of flight at such speeds was a challenge in itself. For this purpose, a variety of ground measurement cameras were set up at Chichester and at RNAS Ford, various ground markers were installed at specified locations, and radar tracking from RNAS Ford and RAF Sopley; flights by Gloster Meteors and de Havilland Venoms for calibration purposes were also conducted by the RAF. Operational demands on both the pilot and ground crews were severe and many runs were attempted but failed to qualify on one technicality or another.

On OSU's first offensive play, running back Kendall Hunter fumbled the ball, {{but it was}} recovered by OSU. During an Oklahoma possession {{late in the first}} quarter, an incomplete pass to Dejuan Miller was ruled a fumble but was overturned following an instant replay analysis. Oklahoma State's next possession saw another fumble, this time by quarterback Robinson, but it was again recovered by the Cowboys. The first quarter ended scoreless with <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>chance</b> of points being a missed 35-yard field goal by Oklahoma kicker Patrick O'Hara. The second quarter opened with the continuation of a drive that began the previous quarter. Following another Oklahoma fumble that was recovered by the Sooners, Oklahoma settled for a 24-yard field goal to claim a 3–0 lead. On Oklahoma's next offensive possession, Jones connected with Broyles for a 47-yard completion to the OSU 13-yard line.

[...] Republican senatorial opinion ranged from the Irreconcilables like Borah, who would not support any organization, to those who strongly favored one; none wanted Wilson to go into the 1920 presidential election with credit for having sorted out Europe. Once the general terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which included the Charter of the League of Nations, were presented by Wilson in February 1919, Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, the incoming Senate Majority Leader, decided on a strategy: rather than outright opposition, Republicans would offer reservations to the treaty that Wilson could not accept.|$|E

In this research, the authors suggest that ”lochlanguage” can be some clues to help children pursue music study. This ”language” is a special language used in music study, in other words, ”a language peculiar to music classes” or ”a language used in talking about music”, which, in fact, differs from child to child.

40|$|The A. {{challenges}} {{the belief in}} the oppositional potential of “small” literatures. An author’s choice to write in their own ‘minor’ language does not depend on whether the work takes part in the field of a minority, a small, a dominant or a world-hegemonic literature. Bukova conveys her commitment to the belief in a “literary literature” that can evade interpretation, ignore the rules of the market, the political heteronomy, or even the agenda of the discourse that is closest to the literary – of literary criticism. Such writers are generally only supported by translators. Bukova points at a niche that is doubly unprofitable but symbolically promising: to write literary literature in the language of a small literature. For “small” realities like Bulgarian literature, which are supported neither by the State nor by <b>the</b> media, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>chances</b> to be ‘convertible’ consist in self-organisation of a literary field, struggling against market and geopolitical rationales and involving translators...|$|R
