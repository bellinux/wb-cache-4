40|$|We {{present a}} series of {{numerical}} experiments that model the evolution of magnetic flux tubes with a different amount of initial twist. As a result of calculations, tightly <b>twisted</b> <b>tubes</b> reveal a rapid two-step emergence to the atmosphere with a slight slowdown at the surface, while weakly <b>twisted</b> <b>tubes</b> show a slow two-step emergence waiting longer the secondary instability to be triggered. This picture of the two-step emergence is highly consistent with recent observations. These tubes show multiple magnetic domes above the surface, indicating that the secondary emergence is caused by interchange mode of magnetic buoyancy instability. As for the weakest <b>twist</b> case, the <b>tube</b> exhibits an elongated photospheric structure and never rises into the corona. The formation of the photospheric structure is due to inward magnetic tension force of the azimuthal field component of the rising flux tube (i. e., <b>tube's</b> <b>twist).</b> When the twist is weak, azimuthal field cannot hold the tube's coherency, and the tube extends laterally at the subadiabatic surface. In addition, we newly find that the total magnetic energy measured above the surface depends on the initial <b>twist.</b> Strong <b>twist</b> <b>tubes</b> follow the initial relation between the twist and the magnetic energy, while weak <b>twist</b> <b>tubes</b> deviates from this relation, because these tubes store their magnetic energy in the photospheric structures.

40|$|This master thesis investigates <b>twisted</b> <b>tube</b> type shell-and-tube heat {{exchangers}} {{with emphasis on}} thermal-hydraulic characteristics, fouling and vibration properties. An extensive literature study {{has been carried out}} in order to map all published research reports written on the topic. The mapping of performed research shows that the available information is limited. Mathematical correlations for <b>twisted</b> <b>tube</b> thermal-hydraulic characteristics are extracted from the research reports found in the literature study. Correlations for convective heat transfer coefficients and pressure loss for both shell side and tube side are presented. The enhancement of heat transfer by swirl flow in a <b>twisted</b> <b>tube</b> bundle is also discussed. Measurements on thermal-hydraulic characteristics are collected from a <b>twisted</b> <b>tube</b> heat exchanger installed at the process facility LNG Hammerfest situated at the northern end of Norway. These measurements are then compared to output from the heat exchanger design software HTRI Xchanger Suite. The calculation accuracy of the <b>twisted</b> <b>tube</b> program module is predicted on this basis. HTRI Xchanger Suite can evaluate heat exchanger design in two different modes. Simulation mode calculates two outlet parameters and thereby the duty, while rating mode calculates only one output parameter where the duty is specified by the user. In rating mode the software has an accuracy of +/- 4 % for temperature, flow and duty calculations. The overall heat transfer coefficient is miscalculated by approximately + 50 % and the shell side pressure loss is miscalculated by + 40 %. In simulation mode the duty is not specified by the user and the program may calculate two output parameters. The predicted accuracy depends on the calculated parameters. Calculation accuracy for two unknown outlet temperatures is +/- 7 % while calculation accuracy for two unknown mass flow rates is up to + 200 %. The accuracy on the overall heat transfer coefficient and shell side pressure loss is the same as for rating mode. The StatoilHydro <b>twisted</b> <b>tube</b> heat exchanger 25 -HA- 113 design on LNG Hammerfest is evaluated with respect to thermal-hydraulic characteristics. 25 -HA- 113 is operated with other flows and temperatures than it was designed for. By use of a mathematical method the expected performance in design operation point is predicted. By analysing the measured overall heat transfer coefficient and by use of this mathematical method, it is stated that the heat exchanger has insufficient thermal design. However, investigation of the pressure loss in the same manner shows that the unit performs better than specified in the design basis. The fouling characteristic is examined by evaluation of the overall heat transfer coefficient over a time period. This analysis shows that the fouling tendency is minimal. By use of the computer program HTRI Xchanger Suite and field measurements a quantitative comparison of a <b>twisted</b> <b>tube,</b> a helix baffled and a single segmental baffled unit is performed for the application of 25 -HA- 113. The alternatives are compared to each other by evaluation of heat transfer coefficients, pressure loss, fouling characteristics and vibration risks. The conventional and the helix alternative are equipped with low fin tubes which show a somehow higher heat transfer capacity per volume unit. However, the <b>twisted</b> <b>tube</b> provides a higher overall heat transfer coefficient than the two other alternatives. The single segmental baffle concept appears to have the lowest shell side pressure loss, followed closely by the <b>twisted</b> <b>tube.</b> With respect to vibration risk the <b>twisted</b> <b>tube</b> has a superior performance compared the two competing concepts due to a very rigid bundle construction. By considering the thermal hydraulic characteristics and the vibration risk connected to the evaluated application the <b>twisted</b> <b>tube</b> is the recommended alternative. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — All new heat {{exchanger}} applications in oil refining, chemical, petro-chemical, and power generation are accommodated {{through the use}} of conventional shell and tube type {{heat exchanger}}s. The fundamental basis for this statistic is shell and tube technology is a cost effective, proven solution {{for a wide variety of}} heat transfer requirements. However, there are limitations associated with the technology which include inefficient usage of shell side pressure drop, dead or low flow zones around the baffles where fouling and corrosion can occur, and flow induced tube vibration, which can ultimately result in equipment failure.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. A {{numerical}} analysis of flow maldistribution and shell side flow on {{heat in a}} shell and tube heat exchanger is presented. The flow field at the inlet and in the headers was obtained by solving conservation equations of mass and momentum by employing k-ε turbulence model. As the flow maldistribution in the header affects the heat transfer performance of the STHE, pressure drop and velocity distribution of the fluid inside the header were analyzed. Two types of headers were considered with varying header length for a Reynolds number range of 1000 to 3000. As the header length was increased to 1500 mm the flow maldistribution decreased and the static pressure was almost equal for all the tubes {{in case of a}} conical header. Also, the numerical simulations show that the conical header with 1500 mm header length has less flow maldistribution when compared to other models. The Shell side flow was modeled as a flow along a <b>twisted</b> <b>tube</b> with a diameter D and a length 30 D using Catia V 519. Four different models of the <b>twisted</b> <b>tube</b> with pitch varying between 4 D and 5. 5 D were studied for a range of Reynolds number Re = 75 - 750. The analysis was carried out for three different wall temperatures of the <b>twisted</b> <b>tube</b> such as 343 K, 363 K and 383 K. The pressure drop increased with increase in Reynolds number, while the pressure drop and outlet fluid temperature increased with decrease in the pitch of the tube. But the convective heat transfer decreased with reduction in pitch. With a decrease in pitch, the energy transfer between the fluid and the adjacent tubes increases resulting in increased outlet fluid temperature...|$|E

40|$|Magnetic flux {{tubes in}} the solar wind can be twisted as they are transported from the solar surface, where the <b>tubes</b> are <b>twisted</b> owing to photospheric motions. It is {{suggested}} that the <b>twisted</b> magnetic <b>tubes</b> can be detected as the variation of total (thermal+magnetic) pressure during their passage through observing satellite. We show that the total pressure of several observed <b>twisted</b> <b>tubes</b> resembles the theoretically expected profile. The twist of isolated magnetic tube may explain the observed abrupt changes of magnetic field direction at tube walls. We have also found some evidence that the flux tube walls {{can be associated with}} local heating of the plasma and elevated proton and electron temperatures. For the tubes aligned with the Parker spiral, the twist angle can be estimated from the change of magnetic field direction. Stability analysis of <b>twisted</b> <b>tubes</b> shows that the critical twist angle of the tube with a homogeneous twist is 70 $^ 0 $, but the angle can further decrease owing to the motion of the tube with regards to the solar wind stream.

40|$|Turbulent flow {{characteristics}} and heat transfer performances of twisted tri-lobed tube (TIT) and twisted oval tube (TOT) with Reynolds number of 8000 - 21, 000 are experimentally compared {{in this research}} work, indicating that ITT provides better heat transfer performance and higher friction factor than TOT. Furthermore, numerical investigation {{of the influence of}} different geometrical parameters on heat transfer performance and {{flow characteristics}} for different twisted spiral tubes using computation fluid dynamics with a validated SST k-omega turbulence model is conducted. These geometrical parameters include different cross section shapes, twisted pitches, twisted direction and lobed numbers. The numerical result reveals that the tubes with larger diameters of out-scribed circle (D- 2) offer higher Nusselt number and friction factor. It is noted that the heat transfer performance and friction factor increase with the reduction of twisted pitch length P. It is also found that <b>twisted</b> <b>tube</b> with right-left hand rotation shows better heat transfer performance than the tube with right hand rotation. In order to understand the heat transfer mechanism of the TTTs, streamlines, velocity and temperature distributions are also given. From the analysis it can be concluded that the heat transfer enhancement of ITTs is attributed to the helical flow and secondary flow induced by twisted curved tube wall. Radial velocity and tangential velocity are generated by centrifugal forces, leading to higher temperature gradients near the wall of lobed region inside <b>twisted</b> <b>tube.</b> Then the field synergy degree between velocity vector and temperature gradient is improved and the heat transfer is enhanced.
