40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. With amjor shifts in military health care, more <b>active</b> <b>duty</b> members are being seen by civilian physicians. This thesis examines Obstetrical care for <b>active</b> <b>duty</b> servicemembers on the Monterey Peninsula. The central objectives {{of this study}} was to analyze incentives for civilian Obstetrical/Gynecological physicians <b>to</b> accept <b>active</b> <b>duty</b> patients. <b>To</b> address this issue, interview were conducted of contracted and non-contracted Obstetrical/Gynecological phyisicians on the Monterey Peninsula. The interviews obtained information about the physician's costs and beenfits for accepting <b>active</b> <b>duty</b> patients. Additionally, with the payment for an <b>active</b> <b>duty</b> member's medical treatment care being closely liked to Medicare rates, the interview data was copared to studies on barriers to prenatal care for low-income patients. The major findings were that the major disadvantage <b>to</b> accepting <b>active</b> <b>duty</b> patients is not that the military pays for health care at a discounted rate. The major disadvantage for physicians <b>to</b> accept <b>active</b> <b>duty</b> patients is the volume of paperwork and claims filing associated with being a contracted physician. The primary benefit the physicians receive by accepting <b>active</b> <b>duty</b> patients is tha additional volume of patients. [URL] United States Naval Reserv...|$|R
