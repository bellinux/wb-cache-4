An additional booklet included expanded track information for each song by Jeff Place, excerpts from Invisible Republic by Greil Marcus, essays by Jon Pankake, Luis Kemnitzer, Moses Asch, and Neil Rosenberg, and tributes and appreciations by John Fahey, John Cohen, Elvis Costello, Peter Stampfel, Luc Sante, Dave Van Ronk, Eric Von Schmidt, Chuck Pirtle, and Allen Ginsberg. The back cover to this booklet closes with a quote by Smith: [...] "I'm glad <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> dreams came true. I saw America changed through music." [...] At the 40th Grammy Awards, the reissue won awards for Best Album Notes and Best Historical Album.|$|E
2500|$|The Reverend Leonard Jenyns, {{a naturalist}} Darwin had known since {{his time at}} the University of Cambridge, had at Darwin's request contributed the volume on Fish in Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, and was now {{working on a book}} of notes on {{observations}} of plants and animals. On 12 October Darwin wrote to tell him that [...] "work on the species question has impressed me very forcibly with the importance of all such works, as your intended one, containing what people are pleased generally to call trifling facts. These are the facts, which make one understand the working or Å“conomy of nature.... namely what are the checks & what the periods of life, by which the increase of any given species is limited." [...] He told Jenyns that he had [...] "continued steadily reading & collecting facts on variation of domestic animals & plants & on the question of what are species; I have a grand body of facts & I think I can draw some sound conclusions. The general conclusion at which I have slowly been driven from a directly opposite conviction is that species are mutable & that allied species are co-descendants of common stocks. I know how much I open myself, to reproach, for such a conclusion, but I have at least honestly & deliberately come to it. I shall not publish on this subject for several years." [...] In November he thanked Jenyns for sending a detailed note, and told him [...] "With respect to my far-distant work on species, I must have expressed myself with singular inaccuracy, if I led you to suppose that I meant <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> conclusions were inevitable. They have become so, after years of weighing puzzles, to myself alone;; but in my wildest day-dream, I never expect more than to be able to show that there are two sides {{to the question of the}} immutability of species, ie whether species are directly created, or by intermediate laws, (as with the life & death of individuals)." [...] He outlined the events that had led him to these ideas, and while cautious about [...] "numerous immense difficulties on my notions" [...] told him that he had [...] "drawn up a sketch & had it copied (in 200 pages) of my conclusions; & if I thought at some future time, that you would think it worth reading, I shd. of course be most thankful to have the criticism of so competent a critic." [...] Jenyns never took up this offer to read the [...] "Essay", but did advise Darwin on possible issues with the term [...] "mutation". Darwin replied [...] "it will be years before I publish, so that I shall have plenty of time to think of better words".|$|E

40|$|People {{identify}} powerfully with music: {{someone might}} <b>say</b> <b>thats</b> <b>my</b> song! {{but they are}} unlikely <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>thats</b> <b>my</b> book! or <b>thats</b> <b>my</b> picture! A digital library of popular music therefore {{has the potential to}} be a compelling application of information retrieval technology. Such a library requires a retrieval method that is appropriate for a non-technical audience. Experiments on query by humming, which attempt to retrieve a tune based on sampled recording of a user singing an excerpt, have heretofore concentrated on relatively small, well-curated collections. Scaling up introduces three problems: availability of source material, an increase in false positive hits, and slower retrieval. We describe our experiments with MIDI files, propose a new, more accurate distance metric between queries and songs, and discuss possibilities for efficient indexing. 1. # INTRODUCTION Digital libraries until now could hardly be described as popular: they tend to be based on esoteric, scholarly sources close [...] ...|$|R
