25|$|The damper, {{instead of}} storing energy, dissipates energy. Since the damping force is {{proportional}} to the velocity, the more the motion, the more the damper dissipates the energy. Therefore, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> when the energy dissipated by the damper equals the energy added by the force. At this point, the system has reached its maximum amplitude and will continue to vibrate at this level as long as the force applied stays the same. If no damping exists, there is nothing to dissipate the energy and, theoretically, the motion will continue to grow into infinity.|$|E

25|$|The 'origin of the soul' has {{provided}} a vexing question in Christianity. The major theories put forward include soul creationism, traducianism, and pre-existence. According to creationism, each individual soul is created directly by God, either {{at the moment of}} conception or some later time. According to traducianism, the soul comes from the parents by natural generation. According to the preexistence theory, the soul exists before the moment of conception. There have been differing thoughts regarding whether human embryos have souls from conception, or <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> between conception and birth where the fetus acquires a soul, consciousness, and/or personhood. Stances in this question might more or less influence judgements on the morality of abortion.|$|E
25|$|At {{very high}} {{magnetic}} field settings the electrons are forced {{back onto the}} cathode, preventing current flow. At the opposite extreme, with no field, the electrons are free to flow straight from the cathode to the anode. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> between the two extremes, the critical value or Hull cut-off magnetic field (and cut-off voltage), where the electrons just reach the anode. At fields around this point, the device operates similar to a triode. However, magnetic control, due to hysteresis and other effects, results in a slower and less faithful response to control current than electrostatic control using a control grid in a conventional triode (not to mention greater weight and complexity), so magnetrons saw limited use in conventional electronic designs.|$|E
25|$|The center trace is a {{straight}} line, {{which is what}} Raoult's law predicts for an ideal mixture. The top trace illustrates a nonideal mixture that has a positive deviation from Raoult's law, where the total combined vapor pressure of constituents, X and Y, is greater than what is predicted by Raoult's law. The top trace deviates sufficiently that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> on the curve where its tangent is horizontal. Whenever a mixture has a positive deviation and has {{a point at which}} the tangent is horizontal, the composition at that point is a positive azeotrope. At that point the total vapor pressure is at a maximum. Likewise the bottom trace illustrates a nonideal mixture that has a negative deviation from Raoult's law, and at the composition where tangent to the trace is horizontal there is a negative azeotrope. This is also the point where total vapor pressure is minimum.|$|E

There is also a [...] "Tension Gauge" [...] {{on the left side of}} the screen which is filled by doing tricks and defeating enemies. The energy it generates allows the player to use boosts of speed while moving; defeating enemies, moving through the level more quickly which results in more points and a higher grade, and when playing as Sonic, accessing the special stage. Although the game is primarily two-dimensional, there are three-dimensional elements which create a 2.5D effect. For the first time in the series, Sonic and Blaze's sprites are rendered in 3D. The game's boss battles are 3D.|$|E
500|$|On a {{molecular}} scale, {{there are two}} main competing reaction processes involved in the degradation of cellulose, or wood fuels, in wildfires. [...] When there is a low amount of moisture in a cellulose fiber, volatilization of the fuel occurs; this process will generate intermediate gaseous products that will ultimately be the source of combustion. [...] When moisture is present—or when enough heat is being carried away from the fiber, charring occurs. The chemical kinetics of both reactions indicate that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> at which the level of moisture is low enough—and/or heating rates high enough—for combustion processes become self-sufficient. Consequently, changes in wind speed, direction, moisture, temperature, or lapse rate at different levels of the atmosphere can {{have a significant impact on}} the behavior and growth of a wildfire. Since the wildfire acts as a heat source to the atmospheric flow, the wildfire can modify local advection patterns, introducing a feedback loop between the fire and the atmosphere.|$|E

[...] "Big Fish is a clever, smart fantasy that targets the child inside every adult," [...] Berardinelli said, [...] "without insulting the intelligence of either." [...] Roger Ebert, in a mixed review, wrote [...] "there is no denying that Will has a point: The old man is a blowhard. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> at which his stories stop working as entertainment and segue into sadism."

500|$|E. W. Swanton {{observes that}} [...] "from the war onwards [...] life {{went into a}} sad eclipse."

She returned to live in New Zealand in 1946. After 1946, Chapman shared a house with the steward of West Hill Golf Club, Bernard Benson, and his health continued to deteriorate. He was frequently observed to be drunk in public, although his appearance and manners remained impeccable; the cricket establishment ignored him, regarding him as an embarrassment, particularly on the occasions he watched matches at Lord's. By {{the end of his}} life, he was unable to attend any cricket matches. In addition to his alcoholism, Chapman became increasingly isolated, suffering from loneliness and depression. By the 1950s, he had developed arthritis, probably {{as a result of his}} sporting activities.
