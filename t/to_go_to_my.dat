[...] Pepys continued westward on the river to the court at Whitehall, [...] "where people come about me, and did give them an account dismayed them all, and word was carried in to the King. So I was called for, and did tell the King and Duke of Yorke what I saw, and that unless His Majesty did command houses to be pulled down nothing could stop the fire. They seemed much troubled, and the King commanded me <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> Lord Mayor from him, and command him to spare no houses, but to pull down before the fire every way." [...] Charles' brother James, Duke of York offered {{the use of the}} Royal Life Guards to help fight the fire.|$|E
500|$|Walters re-signed {{with the}} Eagles before {{training}} camp in 1983. He played in the first preseason game against the Detroit Lions, but {{had to leave the}} game due to an injury. Three days later, on August 8, he announced his retirement from football, saying [...] "After 12 years of playing in the NFL, I earned the right <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> head coach and just say I've fought my battle. It's over." [...] However, when his replacement, Dean Miraldi, suffered a sprained knee in the next preseason game, Walters ended his week-long retirement to re-join the Eagles on August 15. The contract offered to him included a clause that the organization would put up a barn next to his house. He re-injured his knee against the St. Louis Cardinals on September 25 and had to leave the game. Before the November 20 game against the New York Giants, Walters was benched, along with four other starters, by head coach Marion Campbell in an attempt to rejuvenate the team with younger players after five straight losses. He finished the season with ten starts in twelve games. He ended a streak of 122 consecutive starts at left tackle for the Eagles during the 1983 season.|$|E
