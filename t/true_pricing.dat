40|$|Estimating price {{elasticity}} as commonly introduced in mar-keting textbooks is unrealistically simplistic. Actual estima-tion {{is subject to}} numerous confounding factors.

40|$|This study {{develops}} {{an empirical}} framework to estimate quality-adjusted price elasticities from cross-sectional data. The new approach shows {{the importance of}} properly adjusting for quality variation in both prices and quantities in demand analysis. When quality adjustment is concerned only with price, the unit value-based elasticity tends to overstate the <b>true</b> <b>price</b> elasticity. However, when the quality adjustment is considered with both price and quantity, the direction of bias depends {{on the level of}} the <b>true</b> <b>price</b> elasticity. If the <b>true</b> <b>price</b> elasticity is unit elastic, there would be no bias. However, the price elasticity estimated with unit values would understate a <b>true</b> inelastic <b>price</b> elasticity while it would overstate a <b>true</b> elastic <b>price</b> elasticity.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{methodology}} of Genetic Programming to approximate {{the relationship between}} the option price, its contract terms and the properties of the underlying stock price. An important advantage of the Genetic Programming approach is that we can incorporate currently known formulas, such as the Black-Scholes model, in the search for the best approximation to the <b>true</b> <b>pricing</b> formula. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the Genetic Programming model approximates the true solution better than the Black-Scholes model when stock prices folow a jump-diffusion process. We also show that the Genetic Programming model outperforms various other models in many different settings. Other advantages of the Genetic Programming approach include its robustness to changing environment, its low demand for data, and its computational speed. Since genetic programs are flexible, self-learning and sefl-improving, they are an ideal tool for practitioners. ...|$|E

The price impact is instantaneous, that is, it occurs at the instant of trade execution. Our specification also permits the price impact of buys and sells to be asymmetric. We compute an implied <b>true</b> <b>price</b> from our model, and we find that it is closer than the quote midpoint to the unobservable <b>true</b> <b>price.</b> Our empirical analysis also shows that the effective spread, which is computed using the midpoint, has an upward bias, and that the implicit transaction costs may be lower than previous estimates...|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{tests of}} {{conditional}} asset pricing models frequently approximate conditioning information using linear functions of observable variables. We explore {{the effects of}} these approximations in a simple economy in which the level of the short rate and the Sharpe ratio on a well-diversified portfolio serve as the two (latent) state variables. The model has modest nonlinearity that comes from both the dynamics of the state variables and the form of the risk premiums. When the model is calibrated to the monthly excess returns to size-and book-to-market sorted portfolios, we find that even modest nonlinearity in risk premiums can lead to average pricing errors that are in excess of 20 percent of average excess returns — even when the <b>true</b> <b>pricing</b> errors are zero, by construction. At the same time, this nonlinearity is virtually impossible to detect using a simple test based on estimated risk premiums...|$|E
40|$|The {{evidence}} on the relation between idiosyncratic risk and future market return {{is at odds with}} the theory in Merton (1987).

To reduce the noise, we employ a random portfolio approach to construct an alternative aggregate idiosyncratic risk measure. Due to a high correlation between the noise components of the conventional idiosyncratic risk measure and our portfolio idiosyncratic risk measure, we include both measures simultaneously in a predictive regression, in which the conventional idiosyncratic risk measure helps to further reduce the noise in our portfolio idiosyncratic risk measure. We find that both variables are significant and jointly predict returns on the market with an adjusted R 2 of 2 %.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in intertemporal asset pricing theory focus on {{two sets of}} fundamental determinants of asset returns. Models with complete markets emphasize aggregate variables such as per capita consumption. Such models have not performed well empirically. Models with incomplete markets emphasize disaggregate variables such as the distribution of wealth. These models have shown empirical promise, but their lack of parsimony has led many to question their usefulness. Indeed, most empirical applications, {{as well as the}} best practice in the financial industry, ignore much of what theory has to say altogether. Practitioners favor factor models and, in particular, models in which asset returns serve as factors that explain other asset returns. This paper attempts to rationalize these very different approaches. We show that in an incomplete-markets economy—an economy in which the <b>true</b> <b>pricing</b> kernel is high dimensional and difficult to measure—a low-dimensional pricing kernel that depends on returns, as in the CAPM or the APT, can accurately price assets. In this sense, theory based on fundamentals admits an approximate aggregation that is consistent with practical application.

40|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} pieces of empirical evidence against the standard representative-agent, consumption-based asset pricing paradigm are the formidable unconditional Euler equation errors the model produces for a broad stock market index return and short-term interest rate. Unconditional Euler equation errors are also large for a broader cross-section of returns. Here we ask whether calibrated leading asset pricing models – specifically developed to address empirical puzzles associated with the standard paradigm – explain these empirical facts. We find that, in many cases, they do not. We present several results. First, we show that if the <b>true</b> <b>pricing</b> kernel that sets the unconditional Euler equation errors to zero is jointly lognormally distributed with aggregate consumption and returns, then values for the subjective discount factor and relative risk aversion can always be found for which the standard model generates identical unconditional asset pricing implications for two asset returns, a risky and risk-free asset. Second, we show, using simulated data from several leading asset pricing frameworks, that many economic models share this property even though in those models the pricing kernel, returns, and consumption are not jointly lognormally distributed. Third, {{in contrast to the}} above results, we provide an example of a limited participation/incomplete markets model that is broadly consistent with these empirical facts. equity premium; Euler equation; pricing errors...|$|E

We study this question for non-irrigated U. S. maize and soybean yields over 1964 - 2010, having controlled for local effects, weather, fertilization and the pre-existing (non-GM) crop improvement trend. For maize we find that GM varieties have increased realized yields, with a stronger gain in the Central Corn Belt. For soybeans, GM varieties appear to have slightly reduced yields. For both crops we nd a strong trend in yield growth, which may have accelerated in recent years. The second part of the dissertation studies the impact of pricing errors on implied volatilities. Financial researchers and practitioners frequently propose their models and design the pricing formulae based on the observed implied volatility pattern in reality. We find that, in addition to the pattern caused by the mismatch of Black-Scholes formula and <b>true</b> <b>pricing</b> formulae, the observed implied volatility pattern is also influenced by the pricing errors. We propose to study the combined effects of pricing errors and pricing formula on the implied volatility. We find that implied volatility is adversely impacted by pricing errors and stylish patterns of the inverse Black-Scholes price function. Hence, the implied volatility is not a reliable estimator to the underlying volatility even it is carried out for short maturity at the money options. We propose an alternative volatility estimator by inverting a nonparametrically estimated price based on a kernel smoothing estimator of the underlying price function. The proposal can consistently recover the underlying volatility for general price formulae and is free of the afore-mentioned problems with the conventional implied volatility. The third part of the dissertation focused on a situation that the seasonal pattern is a long cycle and the study period covers {{only a few of the}} long cycles, such as a daily series with an annual pattern and includes only 5 - 30 years. This situation is in contrast with the asymptotic study, corresponding to the situation that the sample includes many long cycles, and has been ignored in the literature. Although the estimator based on seasonal-dummy-regression is consistent, unbiased and asymptotically normal-distributed, we find this estimator does not perform well in our focused situation. We propose smoothing the estimated long-cycle patterns by seasonal-dummy regression and evaluate the benefit of smoothing. We study our proposed smoothing-seasonal-dummy-regression estimator for seasonal time series with a long cycle and no short cycle, a short cycle and many short cycles, both theoretically, and via simulation studies, and then apply our methodology to an empirical study of the return rates of electricity prices...|$|E

We show that the resulting sampling frequencies are generally considerably lower than those that would be optimally chosen when time-variation in the second moment of the noise is unaccounted for. These optimal, lower frequencies have the potential to translate into considerable out-of-sample MSE gains. When forecasting using high-frequency variance estimates, we recommend treating the relevant frequency as a parameter and evaluating it jointly with the parameters of the forecasting model.
