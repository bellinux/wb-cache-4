5|$|Another problem {{encountered}} when applying <b>the</b> <b>rational</b> nexus test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness {{occurs when}} the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved by the law. On the other hand, over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective, but also persons outside it. Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under <b>the</b> <b>rational</b> nexus test, as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.|$|E

5|$|Kant's {{conception}} of duty does not entail that people perform their duties grudgingly. Although duty often constrains people and prompts {{them to act}} against their inclinations, it still comes from an agent's volition: they desire to keep the moral law. Thus, when an agent performs an action from duty it is because <b>the</b> <b>rational</b> incentives matter to them more than their opposing inclinations. Kant wished {{to move beyond the}} conception morality as externally imposed duties and present an ethics of autonomy, when rational agents freely recognise the claims reason makes upon them.|$|E

A classical problem of enumerative geometry is to enumerate <b>the</b> <b>rational</b> curves on a Calabi–Yau manifold such as the one illustrated above.
