50|$|If one hikes {{over five}} hills of 100 {{vertical}} feet each, the cumulative elevation gain is 5 × (100 ft) = 500 ft. Only the uphill sections are counted, not <b>the</b> <b>downhills.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1984 in Sarajevo, Steven Lee and Cameron Medhurst placed 19th in <b>the</b> <b>downhill</b> and {{individual}} figure skating respectively. No other top 20 finishes were recorded among the 11 athletes, {{and the two}} cross-country skiers and the first Australian Olympic biathlete, Andrew Paul, finished no better than 47th in their eight events.

The two two-man bobsleigh teams came 23rd and 26th respectively, well down the field.|$|E
5|$|Kane's {{talent was}} {{identified}} whilst skiing at Smiggin Holes, New South Wales, {{and he was}} invited to join the Australian Winter Paralympic Development team when he was 11.

In the cross country, {{she was in the}} lead before a minor crash ripped the seat off its metal frame. For over an hour, she stood on the pedals and lost two places.|$|E
50|$|Downhill skiing {{evolved as}} a {{specialization}} of a previously generic skiing sport. Before {{the era of}} ski lifts, skiing always involved cross-country portions, and <b>the</b> <b>downhills</b> tended to be short, slow, {{and had to be}} skied back up.|$|R
50|$|Heel {{debuted in}} the World Cup on 28 December 2001 at <b>the</b> Stelvio <b>downhill</b> in Bormio, {{finishing}} 37th. In the 2007 season, he achieved his first top ten finish at <b>the</b> Kvitfjell <b>downhill</b> and finished 12th at Lake Louise.|$|R

5|$|Melissa Perrine (born 21 February 1988) is a B2 {{classified}} {{visually impaired}} Para-alpine skier from Australia. Since 2009, she has used Andrew Bor as her sighted guide. She has competed at the 2010 Winter Paralympics in Vancouver and 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi in <b>the</b> <b>downhill,</b> super-G, super combined, slalom and giant slalom events, {{but did not}} medal.

5|$|Mitchell Gourley (born 2 June 1991) is an Australian Paralympic alpine skier who {{competed for}} Australia in <b>the</b> <b>downhill,</b> super-G, giant slalom, slalom and super {{combined}} {{events at the}} 2010 Winter Paralympics in Vancouver and 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, but did not win a medal. At the 2017 IPC Alpine Skiing World Championships in Tarvisio, Italy he {{won the gold medal}} in the Men's Super Combined Standing.|$|E
5|$|Motivated {{in part by}} {{a desire}} to prove that Australians could compete at the highest level, and believing that claims that his brother died due to {{inexperience}} was a smokescreen intended to cover-up the poor safety standards, Malcolm Milne represented Australia at the next two Winter Olympics, won a World Cup event and came third in a World Championship. In 1968, Milne finished 24th in both <b>the</b> <b>downhill</b> and slalom events, Australia's best result in a skiing event up to that point. Ross Martin came 60th in both cross-country events, and Colin Coates came 41st and 49th in his two speed skating events. Australia had more officials present than athletes, with five competitors and three administrators. This trend continued at the 1972 Olympics in Sapporo, which were attended by five staff and four athletes. Milne rose up the rankings to finish 23rd and 24th in <b>the</b> <b>downhill</b> and slalom respectively, as did Coates, who came in the top 30 in three of his four events, including an 18th-place result in the 10,000m event. Milne was considered a medal contender and the team manager felt that but for a near-fall, he would have placed near the medalists.|$|E
50|$|He also {{competed in}} two Olympic Downhill events. Firstly at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, where he {{finished}} 18th in <b>the</b> Olympic <b>downhill,</b> {{and then in}} the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo where he finished fifth in <b>the</b> Olympic <b>downhill.</b>|$|R
50|$|For <b>the</b> alpine skiing <b>downhill</b> courses, {{complaints}} were {{given that the}} courses were too steep. On the men's side, <b>the</b> complaints from <b>downhill</b> skiers {{that it was more}} like a super giant slalom course rather than a classical <b>downhill</b> course. <b>The</b> women's course was 2.77 km long and had the steepest vertical drop ever at 828 m. Further making <b>the</b> women's <b>downhill</b> a challenge was an impending snowstorm that forced race officials to move up the start time and send the skiers out at shorter-than-usual intervals. An intermittent fog also set in during <b>the</b> women's <b>downhill.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 2010 Winter Olympics, Merighetti {{competed in}} <b>the</b> women's <b>downhill,</b> {{combined}} and super-G, {{but failed to}} finish. In the 2014 Winter Olympics, she competed in <b>the</b> women's <b>downhill,</b> where she came 4th, and super-G, where she failed to finish. She did not start in the combined.|$|R
5|$|Perrine {{with her}} guide Andy Bor won five medals - three gold, one silver and one bronze in Women's Visually Impaired {{events at the}} 2015 IPC Alpine Skiing World Championships in Panorama, Canada. Gold medals were won in <b>the</b> <b>Downhill,</b> Super-G, Super Combined, silver medal in Slalom and bronze medal in the Giant Slalom. Perrine became the only Australian female in alpine skiing to finish on the podium in all five events at an IPC Alpine Skiing World Championships.|$|E
5|$|Rahles-Rahbula's {{first major}} success was 2nd {{place in the}} giant slalom at the 2001 National Championships at Mount Hotham. He competed at the 2002 Winter Paralympics in Salt Lake City in four LW2 men's events – {{downhill}} (9th), slalom (17th), giant slalom (did not finish) and super-G (did not finish). At the 2006 Winter Paralympics in Torino, he competed in four standing events, coming 14th in the slalom and did not finish in <b>the</b> <b>downhill,</b> giant slalom and super-G.|$|E
5|$|Sweden {{repeated}} {{its success}} in cross-country skiing, winning all three {{medals in the}} Men's 18km event and all three gold medals available in the sport. Canadian teenager Barbara-Ann Scott became the first from her nation to win an Olympic gold medal in figure skating, and Dick Button from the United States did the same. Alpine skier Henri Oreiller from France won the most medals {{with a total of}} three, with two gold medals from <b>the</b> <b>downhill</b> and combined events, and a bronze in the slalom event.|$|E

5|$|Both of Britain's {{athletes at}} the Games competed in alpine skiing events, {{funding for the}} two athletes was {{provided}} by the British Paralympic Association. Russell Docker, who was paralysed from the waist down following a skiing accident in 1995, appeared at the Paralympics {{for the first time and}} competed in the LW12 classification. He crashed out in <b>the</b> <b>downhill</b> event and failed to complete his other three races. Stephen Napier, who was disabled after being knocked off a motorbike by an unmarked police car in 1995, also competed in four events in the LW10 classification. His highest finish was sixth in the Super-G and he also had three seventh-place finishes. In each of his events Napier was the lowest ranked athlete to complete the course.|$|E
5|$|Gourley competed at the 2010 IPC Alpine Skiing World Cup in Italy and World Cup in Austria. Going {{into the}} 2010 Winter Paralympic Games, his best ever world ranking was 17th. He {{attempted}} to bulk {{up and put}} on additional weight by eating six to eight meals a day. He arrived in the Paralympic village {{with the rest of}} Australia's Para-alpine team on 9 March 2010. Coached by Steve Graham, he competed in <b>the</b> <b>downhill,</b> super-G, giant slalom, slalom and super combined events. In the super-G standing event, he finished 10th. He also finished 27th in the slalom. He came 30th in the giant slalom event.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Norwegian Ski Federation {{proposed}} that the Association for the Promotion of Skiing arrange slalom {{as part of the}} Holmenkollen Ski Festival, but the plans were interrupted by World War II. The slalom hill was inaugurated in 1947, allowing Alpine skiing to be introduced in the Holmenkollen Ski Festival. Slalom took place at Rødkleiva while <b>the</b> <b>downhill</b> was carried out at Norefjell Ski Resort in Krødsherad. The event was named Holmenkollen Kandahar and the races in Rødkleiva were organized by SFK Lyn. Permanent cables for telephone and timing were installed in 1949.|$|E
