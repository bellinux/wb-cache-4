5|$|On 3 November 1918, the Austro-Hungarian {{government}} {{signed the}} Armistice of Villa Giusti with Italy, ending <b>their</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conflict. Following the armistice, the entire Austro-Hungarian fleet {{was transferred to}} the newly formed Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|After {{training}} with Arsenal during the MLS off-season, Henry re-signed {{for the club}} on a two-month loan deal on 6 January 2012. This was to provide cover for Gervinho and Marouane Chamakh, who were unavailable due to <b>their</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2012 Africa Cup of Nations. Henry made his second Arsenal debut as a substitute against Leeds United in the FA Cup third round and scored the only goal. In his last league game on loan, he scored the winning goal in stoppage time in a 2–1 win against Sunderland.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, the Croatian {{government}} was seeking information on 1,997 persons missing since the war. As of 2009, {{there were more}} than 52,000 persons in Croatia registered as disabled due to <b>their</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war. This figure includes not only those disabled physically due to wounds or injuries sustained but also persons whose health deteriorated due to their involvement in the war, including diagnoses of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, as well as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In 2010, the number of war-related PTSD-diagnosed persons was 32,000.|$|E

50|$|The {{middle and}} working classes thus shared {{a desire for}} reform, and agreed on many of <b>the</b> {{specific}} aims. <b>Their</b> <b>participations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> revolutions, however, differed.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Cattaro Mutiny, most of the obsolete warships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, including Kaiser Karl VI, were decommissioned {{to reduce the number of}} idle warships. On 3 November 1918, the Austro-Hungarian government signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti with Italy, ending <b>their</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conflict. After the end of the war, Kaiser Karl VI was ceded as a war prize to Great Britain, under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. She was then sold to ship breakers in Italy and broken up for scrap after 1920.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{received}} significant financial {{rewards for}} reaching the Champions League final. However, despite losing the match, it was Manchester United who earned {{the most money}} from their 2008–09 Champions League campaign, receiving €38.281million compared to Barcelona's €30.968million. All 32 teams in the group stage of the competition received €3million for {{taking part in the}} competition and €2.4million for <b>their</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> group stage matches, as well as further bonuses based on their performances in each match (€600,000 for each win and €300,000 for each draw). For their four wins and one draw, Barcelona received a performance bonus of €2.7million, while Manchester United earned €2.4million for their two wins and four draws. Both teams then also received a total of €7.7million for <b>their</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rounds leading up to the final; however, Barcelona received a win bonus of €7million for winning the final, while Manchester United received €4million for finishing as runners-up. The biggest difference between the teams' financial rewards came {{as a result of their}} share of the market pool, based on the value of the television market in their home countries. As the most successful of the English teams in the competition, Manchester United received the greatest share (€18.781million) of approximately €55.5million reserved for the English teams. However, although Barcelona were the most successful of the Spanish teams in the competition, they had finished in third place in La Liga the previous season, and so received the second-smallest share of the €33.8million given to the four Spanish clubs, taking home €8.168million.|$|E
5|$|Commissioned only a {{few years}} before the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the ships had limited service careers. All three of the battleships conducted training cruises in the Mediterranean Sea in 1912. In 1913, they took part in an international naval demonstration in the Ionian Sea that protested the Balkan Wars. After Italy declared war on Austro-Hungary and the other Central Powers in 1915, the three Radetzky-class ships bombarded coastal targets in the Adriatic Sea. After 1915, <b>their</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war became minimal. All three ships were handed over to Italy {{after the end of the}} war, and broken up for scrap between 1920 and 1926.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I argue that Christopher Kutz misapplies {{his theory of}} joint action when he {{attributes}} shareowners responsibilities {{on the basis of}} <b>their</b> intentional <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corporations <b>in</b> which they invest. Instead I propose that his theory of joint action should be used to attribute shareowners responsibilities on the basis of <b>their</b> intentional <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stock market. If shareholders’ accountability is grounded <b>in</b> <b>their</b> intentional <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stock market, then shareholders cannot take responsibility for corporation’s individual actions. Instead they are solely responsible for the benefits they gain from holding shares if these are a result of moral wrongdoing and for this they should be held accountable...|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{continued}} efforts of U.S. Chess Federation officials, a special FIDE Congress was held in March 1975 in Bergen, Netherlands, {{in which it was}} accepted that the match should be of unlimited duration, but the 9–9 clause was once again rejected, by a narrow margin of 35 votes to 32. FIDE set a deadline of April 1, 1975, for Fischer and Karpov to confirm <b>their</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> match. No reply was received from Fischer by April 3. Thus, by default, Karpov officially became World Champion. In his 1991 autobiography, Karpov professed regret that the match had not taken place, and claimed that the lost opportunity to challenge Fischer held back his own chess development. Karpov met with Fischer several times after 1975, in friendly but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to arrange a match since Karpov would never agree to play to 10.|$|E

5|$|In Guatemala the Spanish {{routinely}} fielded indigenous allies; {{at first}} these were Nahua {{brought from the}} recently conquered Mexico, later they also included Maya. It is estimated that for every Spaniard {{on the field of}} battle, there were at least 10 native auxiliaries. Sometimes there were as many as 30 indigenous warriors for every Spaniard, and it was the participation of these Mesoamerican allies that was particularly decisive. In at least one case, encomienda rights were granted to one of the Tlaxcalan leaders who came as allies, and land grants and exemption from being given in encomienda were given to the Mexican allies as rewards for <b>their</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conquest. In practice, such privileges were easily removed or sidestepped by the Spanish and the indigenous conquistadors were treated in a similar manner to the conquered natives.|$|E

According to the Generalquartiermeister der Luftwaffe, 59 Stukas had been destroyed and 33 damaged to varying degrees in six weeks of operations. Over 20% of the total Stuka strength had been lost between 8 and 18 August; and {{the myth of the}} Stuka shattered. The Ju 87s did succeed in sinking six warships, 14 merchant ships, badly damaging seven airfields and three Chain Home radar stations, and destroying 49 British aircraft, mainly on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The matchup of No.21 Indiana and No.22 Virginia Tech was {{the first}} matchup of ranked teams in Independence Bowl history. Despite that fact, the bowl had {{difficulty}} selling tickets for the game. Slightly more than 33,000tickets were sold by {{the day of the}} game, far less than the stadium's 50,459-seat capacity. In exchange for <b>their</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, each team received $700,000, the minimum payout required by the NCAA at that time.

5|$|To {{describe}} {{the details of}} the attack and its background, Dumont de Montigny and Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz, the leading 18th-century historians of Louisiana, drew on information collected from French women taken captive during the massacre. They explained that the Natchez had conspired with other nations but had attacked a few days earlier than the date agreed upon and that they had used a system of bundles of sticks held by each of the conspiring tribes in order to count down the number of days remaining until the strike. The undetected destruction of a couple of the sticks in the Natchez Grand Village derailed the count, although the reason for the lost sticks differed in each historian's account. The other nations called off <b>their</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plot because of the Natchez' premature attack, and therefore the very existence of the conspiracy remained conjectural.|$|E

5|$|Given {{represented}} the Republic of Ireland at youth level before earning five caps for the Republic of Ireland national under-21 team. Although {{he did not}} become a regular first team player for Blackburn Rovers, Given's performances while on loan at Swindon and Sunderland led to him being called up to the Republic of Ireland squad in 1996. He made his debut for the national team on 27 March 1996, {{in a game against}} Russia. Although Ireland failed to qualify for the 1998 FIFA World Cup or UEFA Euro 2000, Given established himself as first-choice goalkeeper. He played in all of his nation's games at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. With draws against Cameroon and Germany and a 3–0 win against Saudi Arabia, the team reached {{the second round of the}} competition. Meeting Spain in the knockout round, Ireland forced penalties with the score at 1–1 at the end of extra time. Three missed penalties for Ireland ended <b>their</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tournament, and Spain progressed to the next round.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, George and May {{toured the}} British Empire. Their tour {{included}} Gibraltar, Malta, Port Said, Aden, Ceylon, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Mauritius, South Africa, Canada, and the Colony of Newfoundland. The tour {{was designed by}} Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain {{with the support of}} Prime Minister Lord Salisbury to reward the Dominions for <b>their</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South African War of 1899–1902. George presented thousands of specially designed South African War medals to colonial troops. In South Africa, the royal party met civic leaders, African leaders, and Boer prisoners, and was greeted by elaborate decorations, expensive gifts, and fireworks displays. Despite this, not all residents responded favourably to the tour. Many white Cape Afrikaners resented the display and expense, the war having weakened their capacity to reconcile their Afrikaner-Dutch culture with their status as British subjects. Critics in the English-language press decried the enormous cost at a time when families faced severe hardship.|$|E
