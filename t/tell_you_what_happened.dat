500|$|Germain and Klasky {{initially}} {{planned to}} portray the character as divorced, but Nickelodeon executives rejected the idea, feeling that the subject would be inappropriate for younger viewers. The studio also vetoed a reveal that the mother was dead, contending that such an idea would be [...] "scary" [...] and that [...] "children [...] want to see that." [...] Germain stated this prevented them from saying much about the character in earlier seasons, adding: [...] "We mention that she exists but we don't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to her. We even made a joke out of it in one episode. But we weren't allowed {{to go into the}} subject." [...] Even when the show did portray Chuckie's mother as having died from a terminal illness, the word [...] "dead" [...] was never used by any of the characters. The character had been briefly mentioned before in the episodes [...] "Real or Robots?" [...] (1991), [...] "Chuckie vs. the Potty" [...] (1992), and [...] "My Friend Barney" [...] (1993).|$|E

2500|$|... "Stugotz' Weekend Observations" [...] — on Mondays, Stugotz {{gives his}} game {{notes from the}} {{previous}} weekend's sporting events. Before the segment, Papi claims, [...] "Nobody in the media will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> better than my boy Stu." [...] Weiner frequently shouts, [...] "Daaaaan!" [...] before he gives a hot take, and {{has been known to}} use very anti-climactic knock-knock jokes. [...] After each game note, Mike gives a beep sound. Stugotz has understandably been known to put Sean Miller on blast during this segment, and often closes the segment by telling sports figures or teams that they should say hello to Art Briles in Hell. Dan Le Batard has been openly opposed to this segment, but the listeners have frequently voted in favor of this segment. In June 2016, much to the disappointment of his fans, Stugotz admitted that he doesn't write all of the game notes.|$|E

With this album, the band also concluded their 32-year relationship with Mercury Records and its parent label Universal Music Group. The reasons for leaving the label are described in the last song on the album Burning Bridges. Jon said: [...] "This hits it right in the head and <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b> Listen to the lyrics because it explains exactly <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b> And that's that." ...|$|R
