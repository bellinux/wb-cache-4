5000|$|Building on this work, Wallsten [...] empirically {{assessed}} {{the impact of}} political bloggers as a [...] "fifth estate" [...] during the 2004 presidential campaign. Specifically, he used time-series analysis {{to determine the extent}} to which political bloggers followed <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>media's</b> agenda or set <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>media's</b> agenda. He found that there wasa complex, bidirectional relationship between <b>mainstream</b> <b>media</b> coverage and blog discussion rather thana unidirectional media or blog agenda setting effect.|$|R

5|$|McNallen is a {{controversial}} {{figure in the}} Heathen and wider Pagan community. His espousal of right-wing ethnonationalist ideas and his insistence that Heathenry should be reserved for those of Northern European ancestry has resulted in accusations of racism from both Pagans and <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>media.</b> Conversely, many on the extreme right of the Heathen movement have {{accused him of being}} a race traitor for his opposition to Neo-Nazism and refusal to endorse white supremacism.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that the consequences of news media skepticism can lead the public to disbelieve facts, have differing opinions about important issues, and to choose non-mainstream media sources to receive information. These reactions can be dangerous for the news media industry. It is important to gauge if communications graduate students, potential future <b>media</b> professionals, mistrust <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> news <b>media.</b> <b>The</b> {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the relationship between skepticism of <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> news <b>media</b> and news choices of communications graduate students. The author surveyed 76 communications graduate students at Grand Valley State University. Results showed that those who trust <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> news <b>media</b> are more likely to use mainstream sources and those who do not trust <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> news <b>media</b> are more likely to use non-mainstream sources. The author also found that students employed in the news media are less skeptical of <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> news <b>media</b> than those who are not...|$|R

5|$|Raël founded Clonaid (originally Valiant Venture Ltd Corporation) in 1997, {{but then}} {{handed it over}} to a Raëlian bishop, Brigitte Boisselier in 2000.

The chapter, based on preliminary analysis, explores {{the extent to which}} some of the political parties relied on social media as a vehicle for their conversation with their followers, and <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>media’s</b> opportunistic utilisation of this free-for-all information source to know what is happening on the ground. The chapter also points to a nexus between <b>the</b> politicians, <b>mainstream</b> <b>media</b> and social media during the 2014 General Election campaign in India...|$|R
5|$|Since the Mantra-Rock Dance {{brought the}} Hare Krishna {{movement}} to the wider attention of the American public, Prabhupada's increased popularity attracted the interest of <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>media.</b> Most notably, he was interviewed on ABC's The Les Crane Show and lectured on the philosophy of Krishna consciousness on a KPFK radio station program hosted by Peter Bergman.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>media</b> {{depicted}} Diệm as {{a friendly}} and charismatic leader who related {{well to the}} populace. The Herald showed photographs of the president eating cheese, and inspecting the foliage at the Botanic Gardens.
