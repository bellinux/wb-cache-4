40|$|Sometimes {{children}} are born with (part of) an arm missing. Next to congenital loss, children or adults can loose their arm due to an accident or illness. The missing arm can be replaced with a prosthesis, connected to the arm remnant by a socket. Existing sockets {{tend to have a}} hot and humid climate and some sockets are difficult to don and doff. The WILMER <b>open</b> <b>socket</b> is adjustable but looks bulky. All these disadvantages result in reduced wearing of the prosthesis. After the current prostheses are evaluated, the existing patents and available literature are investigated, a list of requirements was made for a new design. With the requirements, the problem can be solved by improving a current socket and designing new sockets. The application of new materials in prosthetics is evaluated, resulting in several new designs. The WILMER <b>open</b> <b>socket</b> is improved, resulting in another design. From these designs one concept is chosen and detailed. The chosen concept is made of stainless steel wire mesh, with an adjustable condyle brace and a standard forearm shell over the mesh.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the harpoon heads excavated from the Moyoro Shell Mound, a famous archaeological {{site of the}} Okhotsk culture in Abashiri City, Hokkaido Prefecture. The site {{is located on the}} left bank of the Abashiri River, which flows into the Okhotsk Sea (Fig. 1). Archaeological finds from the Moyoro Shell Mound, which were excavated from the Pit-dwelling No. 10 in 1948 (Komai ed. 1964), are preserved by the Department of Archaeology, Faculty of Letters, the University of Tokyo. In this paper, harpoon heads made of bone and antlers in this collection will be described and discussed. In addition, some harpoon heads {{in the collection of the}} Hakodate City Museum will also be discussed; these specimens were unearthed from the Moyoro Shell Mound in 1941 and 1942. From the Pit-dwelling No. 10, 23 harpoon heads were excavated (Fig. 2 - 5, PL. 1 - 4). They are classified by the way they are hafted and connected to the line. While only one male harpoon head was found from the floor of the dwelling, 22 female harpoon heads were unearthed from the floor and upper layers, including five unfinished specimens. The female-toggle harpoon heads are subdivided into four types. Type I is an <b>open</b> <b>socket</b> harpoon head, with a line groove also used for lashing the shaft or the foreshaft. Type II is an <b>open</b> <b>socket</b> harpoon head with two line holes to hold the harpoon head and a groove for lashing the shaft or the foreshaft. Type III is a closed socket harpoon head with a thin body. Type IV is an <b>open</b> <b>socket</b> harpoon head with two line holes, which belongs to the Ainu period. The number of harpoon heads of each type found from each layer is shown in Table 2. Type I harpoon heads constitute a large proportion of the unearthed harpoon heads, while only one specimen for each of Type II, Type III, and Type IV was found from the topsoil. Some of the Type I harpoon heads show the traces of reprocessing (Fig. 6). The reduction process of this type of harpoon heads was reconstructed based on these materials (Fig. 7). The Type II harpoon heads in eastern Hokkaido, distributed from Tokoro to Nemuro, are typologically different from the Type II harpoon heads in Southern Kuriles (Fig. 8). Some of the Type III harpoon heads are made of the ribs of sea mammals; this technique is characteristic of this site (Fig. 9) ...|$|R

40|$|Upper limb {{amputation}} causes several functional {{disabilities and}} lowers patient’s self body image. At Delft University of Technology the WILMER <b>Open</b> <b>Socket</b> {{has been developed}} for below elbow amputees. It allows easy donning and doffing, and minimizes perspiration problems by leaving 75 % of the skin uncovered. However, the relative large locking mechanism and the bulky structure of the socket degrade the cosmetic value of the prosthesis and can result in reduced wearing. The {{aim of this study}} was to design a new WILMER socket that fits closer to the skin and is more aesthetically pleasing. A new design was also made for the locking mechanism to reduce the thickness of the socket for children and patients with long and thick residual limbs. The final design and the prototype of the locking mechanism have a height of 7. 2 mm, which means that a reduction of 6. 8 mm has been achieved. The new WILMER socket was made out of stainless steel wire mesh. The socket has a smoother transition between the arm and the limb (< 5 mm) (original 11 mm) and a forearm shell covering the mesh gives a more lifelike appearance. The socket is also adjustable and it can easily be donned and doffed. The new WILMER <b>Open</b> <b>Socket</b> can have a great value for below elbow amputees. A more natural looking prosthesis improves the cosmetic value and can result in increased wearing. However, there are still steps in the fitting procedure that need to be simplified and evaluation of the comfort, permeability and patient’s opinion on the design is needed.

500|$|Dinosaurs {{stand with}} their hind limbs erect {{in a manner}} similar to most modern mammals, but {{distinct}} from most other reptiles, whose limbs sprawl out to either side. This posture is due to the development of a laterally facing recess in the pelvis (usually an <b>open</b> <b>socket)</b> and a corresponding inwardly facing distinct head on the femur. Their erect posture enabled early dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving, which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that surpassed those of [...] "sprawling" [...] reptiles. Erect limbs probably also helped support the evolution of large size by reducing bending stresses on limbs. Some non-dinosaurian archosaurs, including rauisuchians, also had erect limbs but achieved this by a [...] "pillar erect" [...] configuration of the hip joint, where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip, the upper pelvic bone was rotated to form an overhanging shelf.|$|R

With SC, the processing of HTTP requests can be moved to the node that has a cached copy of the requested document, thus bypassing any object transfer between peer servers.

In trace-driven benchmark tests, our system outperforms these approaches by more than 30 % with a cluster of twelve web server nodes...|$|R

40|$|Polling I/O {{mechanisms}} on the Unix platform such as select() and poll() cause high processing overhead {{when they}} are used in a heavily-loaded network server with many concurrent <b>open</b> <b>sockets.</b> Large waste of processing power incurs not only service degradation but also various troubles such as high electronic power consumption and worsened MTBF of server hosts. It is thus a serious is-sue especially in large-scale service providers such as an Internet data center (iDC) where {{a great number of}} heavily-loaded network servers are operated. As a solution of this problem, we propose a technique of fine-grained control on the invocation intervals of the polling I/O function. The uniqueness of this study is the utilization of POSIX real-time scheduling to enable the fine-grained execution con-trol. Although earlier solutions such as an explicit event delivery mechanism also addressed the problem, they re-quire major modification in the OS kernel and transition from the traditional polling I/O model to the new explicit event-notification model. On the other hand, our technique can be implemented with low cost because it just inserts a few small blocks of codes into the server program and does not require any modification in the OS kernel. key words: polling I/O, POSIX real-time scheduling, inter-val control, processor utilization, network programming...|$|R
