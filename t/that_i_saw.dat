5|$|And to Think <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> It on Mulberry Street is Theodor Seuss Geisel's first children's book. It was {{published}} under the pen name Dr. Seuss. First published by Vanguard Press in 1937, the story follows {{a boy named}} Marco, who describes a parade of imaginary people and vehicles traveling along a road, Mulberry Street, in an elaborate fantasy story he dreams up to tell his father {{at the end of}} his walk. However, when he arrives home he decides instead to tell his father what he actually saw—a simple horse and wagon.|$|E

25|$|Geisel's {{earliest}} elephants {{were for}} advertising and had somewhat wrinkly ears, much as real elephants do. With And to Think <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> It on Mulberry Street! (1937) and Horton Hatches the Egg (1940), the ears became more stylized, somewhat like angel wings and thus {{appropriate to the}} saintly Horton. During World War II, the elephant image appeared as an emblem for India in four editorial cartoons. Horton and similar elephants appear frequently in the postwar children's books.|$|E
25|$|I confess that, as {{a student}} unaware {{of the history of}} the subject and unaware of the {{connection}} with cyclotomy, I did not find the law or its so-called elementary proofs appealing. I suppose, although I would not have (and could not have) expressed myself in this way <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it as little more than a mathematical curiosity, fit more for amateurs than for the attention of the serious mathematician that I then hoped to become. It was only in Hermann Weyl's book on the algebraic theory of numbers that I appreciated it as anything more.|$|E

25|$|Geisel {{was born}} and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Henrietta (née Seuss) and Theodor Robert Geisel. All four of his {{grandparents}} were German immigrants. His father managed the family brewery and was later appointed to supervise Springfield's public park system by Mayor John A. Denison after the brewery closed because of Prohibition. Mulberry Street in Springfield, made famous in Dr. Seuss' first children's book And to Think <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> It on Mulberry Street, is less than a mile southwest of his boyhood home on Fairfield Street. Geisel was raised a Lutheran. He enrolled at Springfield Central High School in 1917 and graduated in 1921. He took an art class as a freshman and later became manager of the school soccer team.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, {{the couple}} were {{returning}} from an ocean voyage to Europe when {{the rhythm of the}} ship's engines inspired the poem that became his first book: And to Think <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> It on Mulberry Street. Based on Geisel's varied accounts, the book was rejected by between 20 and 43 publishers. According to Geisel, he was walking home to burn the manuscript when a chance encounter with an old Dartmouth classmate led to its publication by Vanguard Press. Geisel wrote four more books before the US entered World War II. This included The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins in 1938, as well as The King's Stilts and The Seven Lady Godivas in 1939, all of which were in prose, atypically for him. This was followed by Horton Hatches the Egg in 1940, in which Geisel returned to the use of poetry.|$|E
500|$|Chekhov {{witnessed}} much on Sakhalin {{that shocked}} and angered him, including floggings, embezzlement of supplies, and forced prostitution of women. He wrote, [...] "There were times I felt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> before me the extreme limits of man's degradation." [...] He was particularly {{moved by the}} plight of the children living in the penal colony with their parents. For example: ...|$|E

500|$|Bang {{started writing}} the novel in 1885 in Vienna, after remembering Skørping Station: [...] "It {{was in one}} of those windows behind the flowers <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her face, a face which I {{had not been able to}} erase from my memory for two years and which, as if a painter, I felt like drawing in soft, melancholic, almost blurry lines and using it as a kind of cover {{illustration}} for this book." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{saw many}} signs in this campaign, {{some of them}} were not friendly; some were very friendly. But the one that touched me the most was one <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> in Deshler, Ohio, {{at the end of a}} long day of whistle-stopping. A little town. I suppose five times the {{population}} was there in the dusk. It was almost impossible to see, but a teenager held up a sign, [...] "Bring Us Together." [...] And that will be the great objective of this administration at the outset, to bring the American people together.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, M.I.A. voiced {{her fears}} of the {{influence}} of video game violence on her son and his generation, saying, [...] "I don't know which is worse. The fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it in my life has maybe given me lots of issues, but there's a whole generation of American kids seeing violence on their computer screens and then getting shipped off to Afghanistan. They feel like they know the violence when they don't. Not having a proper understanding of violence, especially what it's like {{on the receiving end of}} it, just makes you interpret it wrong and makes inflicting violence easier." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode guest starred Beth Grant, Steve Seagren, and Gary Weeks. Grant {{would later}} reprise her {{character}} in the ninth season episode [...] "Junior Salesman". Grant was asked {{to appear in the}} episode after Daniels saw her performance in the 2007 film No Country for Old Men. Grant praised Carell's improvisational skills—noting that [...] "he just keeps going off script [...] is channeling something"—as well as Wilson's humorous antics while acting. She concluded that [...] "if they had wanted a crazy, wild feature film using all the comedy <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> in just those few days, you could absolutely have had one" [...] with their acting.|$|E
500|$|Whence, in {{the name}} of Count Buffon and Baron Cuvier, came those dogs <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> in Typee? Dogs!—Big hairless rats rather; all with smooth, shining, {{speckled}} hides—fat sides, and very disagreeable faces. Whence could they have come? That they were not the indigenous production of the region, I am firmly convinced. Indeed they seemed aware of their being interlopers, looking fairly ashamed, and always trying to hide themselves in some dark corner. It was plain enough they did not feel at home in the vale—that they wished themselves well out of it, and back to the ugly country from which they must have come.|$|E
500|$|According to Judith and Neil Morgan, Geisel {{conceived}} {{the core of}} Mulberry Street {{in the summer of}} 1936 aboard the MS Kungsholm, a Swedish American luxury liner, during the return trip from a European vacation with his wife, Helen Palmer. As the Kungsholm endured a storm and Geisel suffered from sea sickness, he jotted down a rambling plot that started with [...] "a stupid horse and wagon". To keep himself occupied, he began reciting poetry to the rhythm of the ship's engines and soon found himself saying, [...] "And that is a story that no one can beat, and to think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it on Mulberry Street." [...] For days after they landed, he had the rhythm of the ship's engine stuck in his head, so, at Helen's suggestion, he decided to write a story based around it.|$|E

500|$|The first Sex Pistols gig {{to attract}} broader {{attention}} {{was as a}} supporting act for Eddie and the Hot Rods, a leading pub rock group, at the Marquee on 12 February 1976. Rotten [...] "was now really pushing the barriers of performance, walking off stage, sitting with the audience, throwing Jordan across the dance floor and chucking chairs around, before smashing some of Eddie and the Hot Rods' gear." [...] The band's first review appeared in the NME, accompanied by a brief interview in which Steve Jones declared, [...] "Actually we're not into music. We're into chaos." [...] Among those who read the article were two students at the Bolton Institute of Technology, Howard Devoto and Pete Shelley, who headed down to London {{in search of the}} Sex Pistols. After chatting with McLaren at SEX, they saw the band at a couple of late February gigs. The two friends immediately began organising their own Pistols-style group, the Buzzcocks. As Devoto later put it, [...] "My life changed the moment <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the Sex Pistols." ...|$|E
500|$|Montana told MTV News {{about working}} with Cyrus, [...] "I was in L.A. and she {{happened}} {{to be doing the}} 'Ain't Worried About Nothin'' remix for me. She came by the studio and let me hear her album, which was crazy, and we just went through a couple tracks to see which one I fit on." [...] He continued, [...] "Then she played 'FU' and I fell in love with it. We just went in there and did it together." [...] Regarding the theme of the song, he explained, [...] "It's two letters 'F' and 'U.' You've just got two letters for somebody when you get to that point, when somebody breaks your heart and you're in a relationship which has gone sour. So now you've only got two letters for them, 'F' and 'U'." [...] Its lyrics dismiss a cheating ex, as mentioned in the lines [...] "I don't really have much to say/ I was over it the second <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her name/ I got two letters for you/ One of them is F/ And the other one is U/ 'Cause what you gotta do/ is go get yourself a clue." ...|$|E
