5|$|The {{troops for}} the Ranger company were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Airborne</b> qualified, so the Ranger Training Center heavily {{recruited}} {{troops from the}} 82nd Airborne Division and 11th Airborne Division who had already completed United States Army Airborne School. In spite of this, only one Ranger operation in the conflict ever required an airborne landing. They initially wore a black and gold scroll as a shoulder sleeve insignia, but that insignia was later redesignated the Ranger Tab and the Rangers adopted a black, red and white scroll similar to that unofficially worn by Ranger Battalions in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Operationally, RAF Bomber Command and the U.S. Strategic Air Command cooperated in the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP) {{to ensure}} {{coverage}} of all major Soviet targets from 1958, 108 aircraft of the RAF's V-Bombers were assigned targets under SIOP {{by the end}} of 1959. From 1962 onwards, two jets in every major RAF base were armed with nuclear weapons and on standby permanently under the principle of Quick Reaction Alert (QRA). Vulcans on QRA standby were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>airborne</b> within four minutes of receiving an alert, as this was identified as the amount of time between warning of a USSR nuclear strike being launched and it arriving in Britain. The closest the Vulcan came to taking part in potential nuclear conflict was during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, where Bomber Command was moved to Alert Condition 3, an increased state of preparedness from normal operations; however, it stood down in early November.|$|E

In spite of this, only one Ranger operation in the conflict ever required an airborne landing. At the first Airborne Ranger graduation in November 1950, each Ranger was given a black and gold Ranger Tab as a shoulder sleeve insignia. A few days later, each Ranger was issued a blue and white tab and instructed to sew it above the Ranger Tab. The Airborne Ranger Companies then in Korea were deactivated on August 1, 1951. They were merged into the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team {{to bring them back}} up to strength with airborne-qualified combat-experienced replacements. The 187th had been moved to Kyushu, Japan’s southern island to take on a (then Top Secret) mission to save the UN negotiators at Kaesong, North Korea.|$|E

50|$|On 18 April 1947, the Iroquois Division was {{reactivated}} in Rochester, New York on reserve {{status and}} began training for combat {{in the new}} Cold War environment. It had <b>been</b> previously planned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an <b>airborne</b> division.

25|$|Boelcke had to swerve {{to avoid}} a mid-air {{collision}} in the dogfight and Böhme's Albatros briefly collided with that of Boelcke. The wheels of Böhme's plane barely brushed {{the fabric of the}} top wing of Boelcke's craft, enough to start the fabric unraveling. Boelcke struggled for control as his plane's control surface shredded in the turbulence. He skillfully crashlanded after the entire upper wing tore loose. However, in his haste <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>airborne</b> he had not fastened his seat belt. Boelcke was killed by his relatively mild impact. Böhme survived the accident, as he had suffered only a landing gear damage.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, {{information}} {{on the status of}} the fighter squadrons was known to the Sectors but needed by the Groups to choose which squadrons to commit. For this task, operations rooms also contained a series of blackboards and electrical lamp systems indicating the force strengths of the fighter squadrons and their current status. Known as the [...] "tote board", this allowed commanders to tell at a glance which units were available to receive commands. The statuses were Released (not available); Available (able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>airborne</b> in 20 minutes); Readiness (airborne in 5 minutes); Standby (pilots in cockpit, airborne in 2 minutes); Airborne and moving into position; Enemy sighted; Ordered to land; Landed and refuelling/rearming. Next to the tote board was a weather board. It was the responsibility of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) plotters to continually update the tote and weather boards, and relay that information up the chain.|$|E

2500|$|Also {{at around}} 07h00 the solitary Cessna C-185 {{took off and}} began flying towards Cassinga. Its role in the {{operation}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an <b>airborne</b> observation post, giving the all-clear for the paratrooper drop, {{as well as being}} a radio-relay aircraft (known as [...] "Telstar duty" [...] in the SAAF). It would later <b>be</b> forced <b>to</b> withdraw due to sustained anti-aircraft fire. At around 07h50 two Mirage III fighter aircraft took off, heading straight for Cassinga.|$|R
2500|$|Some Me 262s were {{destroyed}} using a tactic known to 135 Wing as the [...] "Rat Scramble"; Tempests on immediate alert took off when an Me 262 was reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>airborne.</b> They {{did not directly}} intercept the jet, but instead flew towards the Me 262 and Ar 234 base at Rheine-Hopsten. The aim was to attack jets on their landing approach, when they were at their most vulnerable, travelling slowly, with flaps down and incapable of rapid acceleration. The Germans responded by creating a [...] "flak lane" [...] of over 150 of the dreaded Flakvierling [...] "quadmount" [...] 20mm (.79in) AA batteries at Rheine-Hopsten, to protect the approaches. [...] After seven Tempests were lost to flak at Rheine-Hopsten in a single week, the [...] "Rat Scramble" [...] was discontinued. For a while, in March 1945, a strict [...] "No, repeat, No ground attacks" [...] policy was imposed; this only applied for a few days.|$|E

2500|$|Given the {{geography}} of the abbey, his landing site, and the account of his flight, to travel for [...] "more than a furlong" [...] (220yards, 201metres) {{he would have had}} <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>airborne</b> for about 15seconds.

5000|$|Beginning in November 1959, {{in order}} to counter Soviet surface-to-air missile threats, SAC began adding low-altitude bombing {{training}} for its manned bomber force {{as an adjunct to}} its legacy high-altitude training. Use of low level flight route corridors known as [...] "Oil Burner" [...] routes (later renamed [...] "Olive Branch" [...] routes in the 1970s), and the first of three SAC RBS trains were utilized starting in 1960. On 30 June 1960, SAC had 696 aircraft on alert in the Zone of Interior, also known as the ZI (referred to today as the Continental United States, or CONUS) and at overseas bases. These 696 aircraft were 113 B-52s, 346 B-47s, 85 KC-135s, and 152 KC-97s.
