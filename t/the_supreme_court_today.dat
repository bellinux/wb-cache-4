40|$|In the Supreme Court’s {{most closely}} divided cases, one pivotal justice can {{determine}} the outcome. Given this fact, judicial scholars have paid substantial attention to the swing justice. This article makes two theoretical contributions {{to the study of}} the swing justice and this justice’s resulting influence on case outcomes. First, we show that in a substantial number of cases, the justice that casts the pivotal vote is not the median justice on the Court. Second, we argue that the swing justice will typically rely less on attitudinal considerations and more on strategic and legal considerations than the other justices on the Court. The analysis suggests that even among the Court’s most closely divided decisions, which are typically thought to reflect the Court’s most ideologically driven outcomes, the pivotal swing vote is significantly less likely to reflect attitudinal predispositions and more likely to reflect strategic considerations, such as the public’s preferences, and case-specific considerations such as the position advocated by the Solicitor General. The theory and findings suggest that a failure to consider the unique behavior of a pivotal actor—whether on the Supreme Court or any other decision-making body—can lead to incorrect conclusions about the determinants of policy outputs.

40|$|Within the academia, {{two very}} {{different}} groups of legal scholars have devoted {{a great deal of}} attention to Flood v. Kuhn. Those specializing in sports law have either attached Flood as a ridiculous decision that improperly distinguished between baseball and other professional sports, or have praised it for waging guerrilla warfare on the idea that Section 1 of the Sherman Act should apply to intra-league arrangements by owners of the professional sports teams. Those viewing Flood through the lens of statutory interpretation perceive the decision as adhering rigidly to the principle of stare decisis; this rigidity has been both praised and criticized, and Flood has also been attacked for unjustifiably relying on legislative inaction to infer congressional support for earlier precedents. In this Article, an alternative theory is sketched. Although Justice Blackmun 2 ̆ 7 s majority opinion in Flood was eminently sensible in 1972, as a matter of both judge-created sports law doctrine and the legisprudential application of stare decisis, this is no longer the case. In 1972, Justice Blackmun and his colleagues in the majority were justifiably concerned that applying the Sherman Act to professional baseball might ruin our 2 ̆ 2 National Pastime. 2 ̆ 2 However, a brief look at subsequent developments in baseball and in antitrust law clearly demonstrates that the situation has changed. Read in its full context, rather than mechanically, the majority opinion in Flood applies a fact-based legisprudential standard to questions of stare decisis, not the formalistic approach that some have attributed to it. Flood represents neither an unthinking invocation of the dead weight of precedent, nor an unsophisticated and unwarranted deference to a congressional failure to overturn the Court 2 ̆ 7 s prior decisions. Rather, its holding is much more limited. Flood reveals that the Court will adhere to a precedent where it perceives that reliance interests are strong and that the public interest is better served by preserving the precedent. Under this reconsidered view of Flood, <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>today</b> should reach the opposite result and subject baseball to antitrust scrutiny...|$|E
40|$|This Article uncovers the {{forgotten}} complex {{of relationships between}} the U. S. Constitution, citizenship {{and the laws of}} war. <b>The</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>today</b> believes that both noncitizens and citizens who are military enemies in a congressionally-authorized war are entitled to judicially-enforceable rights under the Constitution. The older view was that the U. S. government’s military actions against noncitizen enemies were not limited by the Constitution, but only by the international laws of war. On the other hand, in the antebellum period, the prevailing view was U. S. citizenship should carry with it protection from ever being treated as a military enemy under the laws of war. This Article documents how this antebellum understanding about the protection of U. S. citizenship was challenged and overthrown during {{the first years of the}} Civil War. As articulated by Union statesmen, members of Congress, lawyers, soldiers and publicists, the rebels by seceding and seeking to throw off their allegiance to the United States and its Constitution, had forfeited their right to be protected by the Constitution. Henceforth, all military actions against them would be governed only by the loose standards of the international laws of war - the standards always applicable to foreign enemies. But if, at its option, the United States chose at times to deal with the rebels not as military enemies but as wayward citizens committing civil crimes like treason, then these citizens retained their pre-war constitutional entitlements. Thus the way the United States choose to respond to the rebels determined the applicable legal regime - whether the Constitution and other municipal protections would apply, or only the harsh laws of war. Starting in 1863 in the Prize Cases, and continuing until the end of the century, the Supreme Court decided over 300 cases arising out of the war. The Court adopted and articulated the theories about the relationship between the Constitution, citizenship, and the international laws of war that had been first developed out of the court in the early years of the war. These legal doctrines and understandings prevailed into the mid-twentieth century, until developments like the civil rights revolution and the increasing sense of judicial supremacy began to set the stage for today’s judicial management of the U. S. government’s relationship with military enemies under the aegis of the Constitution...|$|E

50|$|Capron {{was always}} {{concerned}} {{with having a}} good school system. In 1894 a small but enterprising group of Driftwood Township citizens provided {{for the establishment of}} the first Capron Public Schools. The school consisted of grades 1 - 8 and consisted of a two-room frame building located south and east of the present south Coop Grain Elevator. This building proved adequate until 1909 when a new two-story brick building was built in the north end of town {{at the site of the}} present school building. The cost of the 1909 building was $8,500.00. In 1929 residents approved the building of a new one-story building with a large gymnasium and auditorium attached. The old two-story building was torn down to make way for this modern facility. This building was destroyed in the 1939 tornado and a new building, auditorium and gymnasium were built in 1940. At the time, this facility was considered to be one of the best schools in northwest Oklahoma. Additions to the present building were made: in 1952, vocational agriculture building; 1956, additional classrooms and music room; and 1964, when a new cafeteria was added to the school. The high school was first accredited in 1912. In 1968 the high school was closed due to falling enrollment. There were no families in the school district on public assistance in 1968, and the patrons of the district never voted down a tax increase for their school; they wanted the very best for their children. The Elementary School, grades K - 8 were closed in 1976 by a vote of the patrons which carried by only one vote. The vote was contested. This decision was taken to court and eventually upheld by <b>the</b> Oklahoma <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court.</b> <b>Today</b> Capron has two large concrete grain elevators, a rural water district office, United Methodist Church, garage, filling station, and American Legion Post.

40|$|On {{the first}} day of {{virtually}} every course in American Constitutional Law the case of Marbury v. Madison is taught. Students are usually told that this is the case that established what we refer to today as judicial review. They are instructed as to the continuing controversy of how 2 ̆ 2 The Great Chief Justice, 2 ̆ 2 John Marshall, created out of thin air the power or the courts to pronounce acts of the other branches of government unconstitutional. A cursory review of the bare facts of the case usually accompanies the legal analysis of the opinion generally followed by extensive commentary and criticism by put and contemporary legal scholars. All in all the student is left with the impression that the ultimate power that <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> wields <b>today</b> was invented by, and is a direct lineal descendent of, John Marshall and his opinion in the case of Marbury v. Madison. This paper will briefly attempt to dispel this legend. The first part of this piece will trace some of the origins of judicial review to show that it was not the creation of John Marshall in 1800, but rather sprang from circumstances of {{a century and a half}} of history that were peculiar to the American colonies and the new republic. In addition, it will be shown that judicial review had in fact been exercised in the courts of America numerous times before the decision in Marbury, and that this power must have been within the contemplation of the framers at the time the constitution was written. The second part of this paper will examine the whole case and controversy. By examining the events surrounding the case it will be shown that the motives compelling the decision were rooted in a fierce political battle and that the entire issue of judicial review, which need not have been addressed in the decision at all, would never have come up but for this political warfare. The final part of this paper will attempt to show that the case, at the time, did not stand for what it has come to mean today. The continuing controversy that is taught in law schools today is a controversy that did not heat up until long after John Marshall was dead and subsequent <b>Supreme</b> <b>Courts</b> used his eloquence on the matter to expand the power of <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> to dimensions that John Marshall never had intended nor even imagined possible...|$|R
