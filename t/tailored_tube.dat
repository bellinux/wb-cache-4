5000|$|A hangaroc was an apron-like {{outer garment}} worn by women of Norse {{origins in the}} 8th, 9th and 10th centuries. In its usual form the hangaroc {{comprised}} a woollen or linen <b>tailored</b> <b>tube</b> wrapped around the body under the armpits and suspended {{by a pair of}} cloth straps that ran over the shoulders. [...] It hung down to mid-calf.|$|E
40|$|DE 10355959 A UPAB: 20050728 NOVELTY - Method {{for active}} fluid media {{supported}} deformation of a multi-layer semi-finished product, e. g. a welded, bonded or rolled blank or a <b>tailored</b> <b>tube.</b> According to the method the active fluid medium is supplied to {{opposite sides of}} the product so that in the area to be deformed opposite media pressures are applied against each other. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is made for a device for active fluid media supported deformation of a multi-layer semi- finished product. USE - Method for active fluid media supported, e. g. hydroforming, deformation of a multi-layer semi-finished product, e. g. a welded, bonded or rolled blank or a <b>tailored</b> <b>tube,</b> e. g. for use in production of vehicle components, apparatus construction and production of lightweight complex components and structures. ADVANTAGE - Components can be produced with optimized technological properties and minimal manufacturing costs. More severe deformation gradients can be produced without causing localized failure...|$|E

40|$|Increasing demands made on vehicle safety {{as well as}} on {{environmental}} compatibility have required the development of improved body concepts to build lighter but also safer vehicles. Tailored pre-products made from steel sheet such as tailor welded blanks {{play a major role in}} achieving these requirements in the modern automotive body. Tailored blanks have been subject to an immense development. In the beginning it was only possible to weld single straight seams of simple geometry for small parts. Today, larger blanks, multiple design or non-linear seams can be produced without any problem due to both continually improved production concepts and lines. Other innovative tailor made products such as <b>tailored</b> <b>tubes</b> and patchwork blanks are currently being released onto market. Although these steel based pre-products require novel production and processing technologies, they still constitute the most cost effective means of weight reduced body construction. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|The Dittus-Boelter {{equation}} (for turbulent flow) is {{an explicit}} function for calculating the Nusselt number. It {{is easy to}} solve but is less accurate {{when there is a}} large temperature difference across the fluid. It is <b>tailored</b> to smooth <b>tubes,</b> so use for rough tubes (most commercial applications) is cautioned. The Dittus-Boelter equation is: ...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} spin-wave excitations in rolled-up Permalloy microtubes using microwave absorption spectroscopy. We find {{a series of}} quantized azimuthal modes which arise from the constructive interference of Damon-Eshbach type spin waves propagating around the circumference of the microtubes, forming a spin-wave resonator. The mode spectrum can be <b>tailored</b> by the <b>tube's</b> radius and number of rolled-up layers. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

Because the patient 2 ̆ 7 s VP shunt was running through her right anterior chest and abdominal wall, a driveline exit site was selected in her left upper quadrant to avoid unnecessary perioperative complication {{in relation to the}} patent VP shunt <b>tube.</b> <b>Tailored</b> driveline placement was a key element of this LVAD implantation in this already sick patient with multiple comorbidities...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} defects that inevitably exist in real-world carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are generally considered undesirable because they break the structural perfection and {{may result in}} drastically degraded CNT properties. On the other hand, the deliberate defect introduction can provide a possibility to <b>tailor</b> the <b>tube</b> mechanical properties. Herein, we present a fully controllable technique to handle defects by using in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Young's modulus, quality factor of the resonation and tensile strength of CNTs can be controllably, reversibly, and repeatedly tuned. Parallel high-resolution visualizing of {{structural defects}} suggests that the property tuning cycles are primarily attributed to the reversible conversion of defects at the atomic scale: the defects are created {{in the form of}} vacancies and interstitials under electron irradiation, and they vanish through the recombination via current-induced annealing. For applications, such as reversible frequency-tuned CNT resonators, this defect-engineering technique is demonstrated to be uniquely precise; the frequency may be tuned with 0. 1 %/min accuracy, improved by 1 order of magnitude compared with the existing approaches. We believe that these results will be highly valuable in a variety of property-tunable CNT-based composites and devices...|$|R
