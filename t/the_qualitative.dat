In partial epileptic seizures, consciousness is impaired or lost while some aspects of consciousness, often automated behaviors, remain intact. Studies found that when measuring <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> features during partial epileptic seizures, patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the experience of the seizure, followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the early}} 1980s, the United States had relied on <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> superiority of its weapons to {{essentially}} frighten the Soviets, but the gap had been narrowed. Although the Soviet Union did not accelerate military spending after President Reagan's military buildup, their large military expenses, {{in combination with}} collectivized agriculture and inefficient planned manufacturing, were a heavy burden for the Soviet economy. At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, {{which resulted in a}} drop of oil prices in 1985 to one-third of the previous level; oil was the main source of Soviet export revenues. These factors contributed to a stagnant Soviet economy during Gorbachev's tenure.|$|E
5|$|Galileo made {{original}} {{contributions to}} the science of motion through an innovative combination of experiment and mathematics. More typical of science {{at the time were}} <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> studies of William Gilbert, on magnetism and electricity. Galileo's father, Vincenzo Galilei, a lutenist and music theorist, had performed experiments establishing perhaps the oldest known non-linear relation in physics: for a stretched string, the pitch varies as the square root of the tension. These observations lay {{within the framework of the}} Pythagorean tradition of music, well-known to instrument makers, which included the fact that subdividing a string by a whole number produces a harmonious scale. Thus, a limited amount of mathematics had long related music and physical science, and young Galileo could see his own father's observations expand on that tradition.|$|E

5|$|The {{peripheral}} nerves of the parasympathetic {{nervous system}} that carry messages to the brain (afferent nerve fibers) may explain why people with complete SCI feel sexual and climactic sensations. One proposed explanation for orgasm in women despite complete SCI is that the vagus nerve bypasses the spinal cord and carries sensory information from the genitals directly to the brain. Women with complete injuries can achieve sexual arousal and orgasm through stimulation of the clitoris, cervix, or vagina, which are each innervated by different nerve pathways, which suggests that even if SCI interferes with one area, function might be preserved in others. In both injured and uninjured people, the brain {{is responsible for the}} way sensations of climax are perceived: <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> experiences associated with climax are modulated by the brain, rather than a specific area of the body.|$|E

High-throughput automated diagnostic tests like Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV- 1 Qual Test (Roche CAPCTM Qual) and the Abbott Real Time HIV- 1 Qualitative (Abbott Qualitative) can be used to rapidly expand early infant diagnosis testing services. In this study, the performance characteristics of <b>the</b> Abbott <b>Qualitative</b> were evaluated using two hundred dried blood spots (DBS) samples (100 HIV- 1 positive and 100 HIV- 1 negative) collected from infants attending the antenatal facilities in Kisumu, Kenya. <b>The</b> Abbott <b>Qualitative</b> results were compared to the diagnostic testing completed using the Roche CAPCTM Qual in Kenya. The sensitivity and specificity of <b>the</b> Abbott <b>Qualitative</b> were 99. 0 % (95 % CI: 95. 0 - 100. 0) and 100. 0 % (95 % CI: 96. 0 - 100. 0), respectively, and the overall reproducibility was 98. 0 % (95 % CI: 86. 0 - 100. 0).
