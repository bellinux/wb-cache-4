5|$|During {{his first}} term as mayor, Armstrong oversaw many issues <b>that</b> <b>concerned</b> the city. In March 1911, he {{expressed}} his support for a new city hall building to be built, expressing his dissatisfaction with the existing building that housed the council and civic employees, mentioning the ever-expanding number of staff. Later in that year, a committee would be formed concerning the issue, and a new structure would be planned with a planned cost of one million dollars. In July of that same year, he would sign a bylaw that would allow an American entrepreneur to establish a gas plant in the city, an issue that had been presented to council for debate several months prior. Later that year, {{the prospect of a}} municipal gas plant would also be supplied to city council. In July 1911, when, along with the city council, he dismissed a pair of city commissioners after months of debate. The firing triggered a by-election when alderman James H. McKinley would resign in protest to the action. In 1911, he also served as {{a vice president of the}} Union of Alberta Municipalities. Involved in national and provincial affairs, he voiced his support for a canal to be constructed in the Georgian Bay of Lake Huron, stating that the presence of such canal would improve the trading relations of Canada with the United States by allowing an easier route between the two countries. He also was in favour of a hydroelectric project in the Athabasca River. Additionally, during t{{his first term}} as mayor, Armstrong also oversaw the city's festivities on George V's coronation and moved to form a municipal purchasing department.|$|E
5|$|Two {{extensive}} espionage {{cases in}} Sweden during the Cold War involved Boden Fortress, both exposed in 1951. The Enbom case involved Fritiof Enbom, a former worker at the Swedish State Railways in Boden, {{and later the}} local editor for the communist newspaper Norrskensflamman. He was exposed by his own careless talkoften {{under the influence of}} alcoholto the owners of the house in Stockholm where he had lodged since he moved there from Boden. The family told the Swedish Security Service after the Christmas holidays of 1951, and Enbom was arrested on 16 February 1952. During interrogation, he confessed that hefrom February 1943 to April 1951had met with Soviet employers around 25 times. Enbom had provided a large variety of intelligence, most of it from public sources, but also secrets, of which the armament of one of the forts in the fortress was one of the pieces of information <b>that</b> <b>concerned</b> Boden Fortress and nearby fortifications. He was sentenced to lifetime hard labour, but was released after ten years. The other case involved Ernst Hilding Andersson, who was arrested on 21 September 1951. He had carried out seven missions for the Soviets and had provided them primarily with information regarding the Swedish Navy, but also information on the fortifications along the Norrland coast, and an initiated report about Boden Fortress and the airforce unit located in Boden and Luleå, Norrbottens flygbaskår. Andersson was, like Fritjof Enbom, sentenced to hard labour for life.|$|E

5|$|While {{cyberpunk}} {{remained a}} core {{part of the}} game, the team were faced with the trouble that no-one really knew what cyberpunk was any more: the most recent game and film references they had were from the early 2000s, as many works {{that might have been}} classed as cyberpunk were now being treated as science fiction. While they could easily have replicated the atmosphere of films like Blade Runner, the team wanted to create something original within the genre. Something <b>that</b> <b>concerned</b> the team was about portraying the world of Human Revolution in relation to the original Deus Ex, which chronologically took place 25 years later: while the original Deus Ex used technological elements common {{at the time it was}} made such as 4:3 aspect ratio monitors and landline telephones, Human Revolution used mobiles and wide-screen televisions. According to Jacques-Belletête, this separation was ultimately put down to the differing portrayals of the world between the two games: while Deus Ex was set in poor communities and focused on the social impact of new technology, Human Revolution focused on the high end of society and technology's physical impact.|$|E

Previous Catholic Church councils had rarely felt the need to pronounce on these matters, unlike Orthodox ones which have often ruled on specific types of images.|$|E

25|$|Fern was {{extremely}} successful in her lifetime as a columnist. She {{was said to}} fit her material and subject matter to the audience. Many readers of weekly literary papers were women, and Fern addressed them in a conversational style, often using interjections and exclamation points, while tackling topics <b>that</b> <b>concerned</b> the daily life of ordinary women. Her readers were wives and mothers who worried about their children, current fashions, difficult husbands, and aggravating relatives. Sometimes they felt oppressed, depressed, or stressed. Fern expressed their problems in plain language, addressing women's suffrage, the woman's right to her children in a divorce, unfaithful husbands, social customs that restricted women's freedom, and sometimes just having a bad day.|$|E
25|$|Usurpation of {{the public}} life {{continued}} after {{the demise of the}} Provisional Government. The Lithuanian Activist Front was banned in September 1941 and some of its leaders transported to concentration camps. In December the last legal party of Lithuania, pro-Nazi Lithuanian Nationalist Party, was also banned. Most of the laws adopted by the Provisional Government remained paper declarations. However a couple laws <b>that</b> <b>concerned</b> items of no immediate interest of the Germans, including local administration and education, had somewhat lasting effect. The government left developed local administration, staffed with Lithuanians. That allowed some passive resistance when German orders from top could be blocked by the bottom. For example, Lithuanians resisted recruitment to a Waffen-SS division, quotas for forced labor in Germany, or Germanization of Lithuanian schools.|$|E
25|$|The Casement Report {{comprises}} {{a multitude}} of individual statements gathered by the British Consul, Roger Casement, including several detailing the grim tales of killings, mutilation, kidnapping, and cruel beatings of the native population by soldiers of the Congo administration of King Leopold. The British Parliament demanded a second meeting of the 14 signatory powers of the 1885 Berlin Conference, at which time the Belgian Parliament forced a reluctant Leopold {{to set up an}} independent commission of enquiry. This led to the arrest and punishment of several officials who had been responsible for murders during a rubber-collection expedition in 1903. The reforms that followed the Casement Report, including those <b>that</b> <b>concerned</b> ABIR at Basankusu, set the foundation for the colonial Belgian state of Congo.|$|E

25|$|Although Herbert's {{reputation}} {{lies with}} his operettas, he also composed two grand operas. He searched {{for several years}} for a libretto that appealed to him, finally finding one by Joseph D. Redding called Natoma <b>that</b> <b>concerned</b> a historical story set in California. He composed the work from 1909 to 1910, and it premiered in Philadelphia on 25 February 1911 with soprano Mary Garden {{in the title role}} and the young Irish tenor John McCormack in his opera debut. The opera was well received and was repeated as part of the company's repertory during the next three seasons. It also enjoyed performances in New York City, making its debut there on February 28, 1911. Herbert's other opera, Madeleine, was a much lighter work in one act. On 24 January 1914, it had its premiere at the Metropolitan Opera, but it was not revived beyond that season.|$|E
25|$|At the meeting, held in Naples, Florida from March 9–11, 2009, general {{managers}} of the teams discussed issues <b>that</b> <b>concerned</b> them. Consensus on any topic would lead to action by the Board of Governors or the Competition committee in later meetings. Paul Kelly, president of the NHLPA, made a presentation {{on the topic of}} dangerous hits to the head, proposing new rules to penalize intentional hits. The {{general managers}} could not agree on the planned rule change and took no further action. Kelly intends to review the issue at the future Competition committee meeting, which is held after the Stanley Cup final. The general managers also discussed the topic of fighting in hockey, and agreed to penalize further players who start fights directly after face-offs and to further enforce the existing 'instigator' rule. The managers agreed to award a second-round compensatory pick in the 2009 entry draft to the New York Rangers due to the death of Alexei Cherepanov.|$|E

To his surprise, the movement leaders demanded acceptance of the entire petition. Sturdza withdrew to the army barracks and that evening took steps to crush the opposition. Several people were killed in brief fighting, and some 300 were arrested. Among those who fled, either to Transylvania or Bukovina, were Alecsandri and the young officer Alexandru Ioan Cuza, who would come to rule the United Principalities in the 1860s. Sturdza, now bent on permanently halting all dissent, made anyone even suspected of opposition subject to arrest, imposed strict censorship, and had students returning from France stopped at the border and interrogated before being allowed to proceed.|$|E

25|$|Tuberculosis is a {{major public}} health problem in China. China has the world's third largest cases of {{tuberculosis}} (after India and Indonesia), but progress in tuberculosis control was slow during the 1990s. Detection of tuberculosis had stagnated at around 30% of the estimated total of new cases, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was a major problem. These signs of inadequate tuberculosis control {{can be linked to}} a malfunctioning health system. The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, brought to light substantial weaknesses in the country's public health system. After the government realized the impact that the SARS outbreak had on the country, they increased leadership in their health department. After the SARS epidemic was brought under control, the government increased its commitment and leadership to tackle public health problems and, among other efforts, increased public health funding, revised laws <b>that</b> <b>concerned</b> the control of infectious diseases, implemented the world's largest internet-based disease reporting system to improve transparency, reach and speed, and started a program to rebuild local public health facilities and national infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|In 1776, the Thirteen Colonies, acting {{through the}} Second Continental Congress, {{declared}} political independence from Great Britain during the American Revolution. The new states, though independent {{of each other}} as nation states, recognized the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the British. Desiring to avoid anything that remotely resembled a monarchy, Congress negotiated the Articles of Confederation to establish an alliance between the states. As a central authority, Congress under the Articles was without any legislative power; it could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, nor any taxes or local commercial regulations enforceable upon citizens. This institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of Crown and Parliament ought to have functioned {{with respect to the}} royal dominion: a superintending body for matters <b>that</b> <b>concerned</b> the entire empire. Out from under any monarchy, the states assigned some formerly royal prerogatives (e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress, while severally lodging the rest within their own respective state governments. Only after all the states agreed to a resolution settling competing western land claims did the Articles take effect on March 1, 1781, when Maryland became the final state to ratify them.|$|E
25|$|The one Italian {{strength}} <b>that</b> <b>concerned</b> the Allies was the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina), the fourth-largest navy in {{the world}} at the time. In November 1940, the British Royal Navy launched a surprise air attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto which crippled Italy's major warships. Although the Italian fleet did not inflict serious damage as was feared, it did keep significant British Commonwealth naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea. This fleet needed to fight the Italian fleet to keep British Commonwealth forces in Egypt and the Middle East from being cut off from Britain. In 1941 on the Italian-controlled island of Kastelorizo, off of the coast of Turkey, Italian forces succeeded in repelling British and Australian forces attempting to occupy the island during Operation Abstention. In December 1941, a covert attack by Italian forces took place in Alexandria, Egypt, in which Italian divers attached explosives to British warships resulting in two British battleships being sunk. This was known as the Raid on Alexandria. In 1942, the Italian navy inflicted a serious blow to a British convoy fleet attempting to reach Malta during Operation Harpoon, sinking multiple British vessels. Over time, the Allied navies inflicted serious damage to the Italian fleet, and ruined Italy's one advantage to Germany.|$|E
