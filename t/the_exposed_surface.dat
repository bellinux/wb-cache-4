This method {{is used in}} cortical stimulation mapping, {{used in the study}} of the relationship between cortical areas and their systemic function. By using much smaller microelectrodes, single-unit recordings can be made from a single neuron that give a high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. This has enabled the linking of brain activity to behaviour, and the creation of neuronal maps.|$|E
5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision. This is partly {{the result of}} cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light. Another adaptation to dim light is the large pupils of cats' eyes. Unlike some big cats, such as tigers, domestic cats have slit pupils. These slit pupils can focus bright light without chromatic aberration, and are needed since the domestic cat's pupils are much larger, relative to their eyes, than the pupils of the big cats. At low light levels a cat's pupils will expand to cover most of <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>surface</b> of its eyes. However, domestic cats have rather poor color vision and (like most nonprimate mammals) have only two types of cones, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; they have limited ability to distinguish between red and green. A 1993 paper reported a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rods which {{might be due to}} a third type of cone. However, this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.|$|E

The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 17–23 by 7.5–10μm, and four-spored with sterigmata around 3 μm long. The paraphyses are 5–8μm wide, {{shorter than the}} basidia, more abundant and form a somewhat gelatinous layer. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the cap edge) are 60 by 7–21μm, hyaline, conical or ventricose (inflated). The tips of the cheilocystidia are drawn out to a point, or have a short appendage measuring 15 by 2–3μm, which is sometimes branched, and is thin or slightly thick-walled. There are no cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia). Pileocystidia (cystidia {{on the surface of}} the cap) are club-shaped, measuring 25–60 by 13–25μm. They are somewhat thick-walled, and spiny on <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>surface</b> with short simple outgrowths extending up to 3μm long. The pileocystidia are joined together and form a continuous layer over the young cap, but break up as the cap expands. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) are conical or lance-shaped, hyaline, and smooth, with walls that are thin or slightly thickened. They measure up to 300 by 10–25μm, but are shorter in the upper regions of the stem. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of all tissues.|$|E

25|$|Many {{structural}} alloys corrode merely {{from exposure}} to moisture in air, but the process can be strongly affected by exposure to certain substances. Corrosion can be concentrated locally to form a pit or crack, or it can extend across a wide area more or less uniformly corroding the surface. Because corrosion is a diffusion-controlled process, it occurs on exposed surfaces. As a result, methods to reduce the activity of <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>surface,</b> such as passivation and chromate conversion, can increase a material's corrosion resistance. However, some corrosion mechanisms are less visible and less predictable.|$|E

In this contribution a system addressing this problem is described: a laser range finder mounted on the hand of an industrial robot is used for data acquisition. A vacuum gripper, mounted as well on the robot hand is employed from grasping the objects from their <b>exposed</b> <b>surfaces.</b> We localize <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>surfaces</b> of <b>the</b> objects via a hypothesis generation and verification framework. Accurate hypotheses about the pose and {{the dimensions of the}} boundary of <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>surfaces</b> are generated from edge information obtained from the input range image, using a variation of the Hough transform.

25|$|A {{possible}} {{method for}} mind uploading is serial sectioning, {{in which the}} brain tissue and perhaps {{other parts of the}} nervous system are frozen and then scanned and analyzed layer by layer, which for frozen samples at nano-scale requires a cryo-ultramicrotome, thus capturing the structure of the neurons and their interconnections. <b>The</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>surface</b> of frozen nerve tissue would be scanned and recorded, and then the surface layer of tissue removed. While this would be a very slow and labor-intensive process, research is currently underway to automate the collection and microscopy of serial sections.

25|$|Normally {{snow has}} little overall {{direct effect on}} stream-flow within the watershed. However, on rare {{occasions}} warm rains falling on the snow-pack may result in rapid melting and release of large quantities of water {{at a time when}} the soils are already fully saturated. These conditions result in rapid runoff and floods. A large proportion of <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>surface</b> rock in the Barouk region is cavernous, fissured and broken limestone, and its porous condition makes it very permeable. This results in much of the precipitation infiltrating with minimum surface runoff despite the often-shallow soils and sparse vegetative cover. Water percolates downward through the various formations and feeds the many large springs found on lower slopes in the area. Such springs help maintain stream-flow during the April to November dry season.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} {{begins as}} tidal flats gain elevation relative to sea level by sediment accretion, and subsequently the rate {{and duration of}} tidal flooding decreases so that vegetation can colonize on <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>surface.</b> The arrival of propagules of pioneer species such as seeds or rhizome portions are combined {{with the development of}} suitable conditions for their germination and establishment in the process of colonisation. When rivers and streams arrive at the low gradient of the tidal flats, the discharge rate reduces and suspended sediment settles onto the tidal flat surface, helped by the backwater effect of the rising tide. Mats of filamentous blue-green algae can fix silt and clay sized sediment particles to their sticky sheaths on contact which can also increase the erosion resistance of the sediments. This assists the process of sediment accretion to allow colonising species (e.g.,Salicornia spp.) to grow. These species retain sediment washed in from the rising tide around their stems and leaves and form low muddy mounds which eventually coalesce to form depositional terraces, whose upward growth is aided by a sub-surface root network which binds the sediment. Once vegetation is established on depositional terraces further sediment trapping and accretion can allow rapid upward growth of the marsh surface such that there is an associated rapid decrease in the depth and duration of tidal flooding. As a result, competitive species that prefer higher elevations relative to sea level can inhabit the area and often a succession of plant communities develops.|$|E

Many fossilized crinoids, brachiopods, [...] bryozoans, horn corals, nautiloids, and sponges, along with other marine organisms such as large and complex trilobites {{have been found in}} the Redwall.
