40|$|Current {{watercolor}} painting systems produce convincing results, but trade {{this quality}} for a simulation {{that is much}} too slow for interactive use. We describe {{the implementation of a}} paper model that allows for real-time creation of watercolor images by simulating the mechanics of pigment and water throughout a <b>three-layer</b> <b>paper</b> model. In order to keep the simulation real-time while painting on large surfaces, we adopt a distributed paper canvas by dividing it in a grid of subpapers, each of which is delegated to a remote process. ...|$|E
40|$|Parabolic three-layered reflectors from polymer {{composite}} materials with the aluminium honeycomb fillers became {{widely used in}} space communication systems in the past decades. There are technological possibilities for creating reflectors {{in the form of}} thin-walled ribbed shell with the lower linear density than that of the <b>three-layered</b> structures. The <b>paper</b> presents the results of the temperature and stress-strain analysis for the two types of structures, which could help to select the variant with the best performance characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Long latency evoked {{potentials}} (EP's) are electrical potentials {{related to}} brain information processing mechanisms. In this <b>paper,</b> <b>three-layered</b> neurophysiologically based {{artificial neural network}} model is presented whose neurons obey to Dale's law. The first two layers of the network can memorize and recall sparsely coded patterns, oscillating at biologically plausible frequencies. Excitatory low-pass filtering synapses, from the second to the third layer, create evoked current dipoles, when the network retrieves memories related to stimuli. Based on psychophysiological indications, simulated intracranial dipoles are straightforwardly transformed into long latency EP components such as N- 100 and P- 300 that match laboratory-measured scalp EP's...|$|R
40|$|Gamification - is a {{methodology}} that enchants on-games context with game mechanics and game design. Document {{is a study}} of project management system gamification. Project management system is gamified by adding game layer to it. Paper introduces “Trogon” project management systems based on <b>three-layer</b> architecture. <b>Paper</b> overviews project management systems gamifications. According to a formal system description gamification is a set G, which consists of game elements and relevant parts of project management system. Technical view into gamification solution implementation consists of two parts - data classes and visualization classes. This model of gamification {{can be applied to}} any system that implements gamification data contract. In this paper we have described the performed quality analysis of the system, during which a study was done of system maintenance metrics and their changes in different versions of the system. Different versions study allows us to determine system compliance with second and fourth Lehman laws. Following a detailed assessment of system final version determined system maintenance metrics and possible system maintainability improvements. Experimental study consists of two parts: color analysis of several system pages in compliance with WCAG 2. 0 contrast ratio requirements for accessibility and gamification usability evaluation. For color analysis paper proposes a new methodology for evaluation color contrast ratio requirements of pages using screenshots. In this study, three system pages where found matching the requirements of WCAG 2. 0 contrast ratio. Gamification usability assessment is done by using System Usability Scale (SUS). This methodology is extended and adapted for system gamification usability evaluation. Study shows that the developed system is evaluated as having good usability (71 out of 100 possible points). It was found that there are no usability differences between men and women. The differences of gamification usability results are based on specialization in IT sector. The study found that consumers not specializing in IT sector gave lower usability score for the project management system. Lowest usability score is given to gamification elements. Scoreboard is highest rated element...|$|R
40|$|Four {{different}} {{trials of}} stratified <b>three-layered</b> fine <b>paper,</b> of sulphate pulp, {{were performed to}} investigate if stratified fine fraction or fibres from birch can improve the properties of a paper compared to a reference sheet. All trials had five different scenarios and each scenario was calendered with different linear load. All sheets had a grammage of 80 g/m 2. In the first trial, the paper contained birch, pine and filler of calciumcarbonate (marble), and was manufactured with the pilot paper machine XPM and the stratified headbox Formator at RCF (Stora Enso Research Center in Falun). The furnish consisted of 75 % birch and 25 % pine. The second trial contained coated sheets with paper from trial one as the base paper. The coating slip contained calciumcarbonate and clay and the amount was approximately 10 - 12 g/m 2. The third trial, also with birch and pine but without filler, was performed at STFI (Skogsindustrins Tekniska Forskningsinstitut in Stockholm) with the laboratory scaled paper machine StratEx and the stratified headbox AQ-vanes. The furnish consisted of 75 % birch and 25 % pine, except for one scenario which contained of 75 % pine and 25 % birch. The last trial contained fractionated pulp of birch and pine and was performed at STFI. 50 % was fine fraction and 50 % was coarse fraction. This test does not show any clear benefits of making stratified sheets of birch and pine {{when it comes to}} properties such as bending stiffness, tensile index and surface smoothness. The retention can be improved with birch in the surface plies. It is possible that the formation can be improved with birch in the surface plies and pine in the middle ply. It is also possible that fine fraction in the surface plies and coarse fraction in the middle ply can improve both surface smoothness and bending stiffness. The results in this test are shown with confidence intervals which points out the difficulties of analysing sheets manufactured with a pilot paper machine or a laboratory scaled paper machine...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the plate {{composed}} of two identical isotropic outer layers and a more compliant inner interlayer, perfectly connected to one another at the interface (<b>three-layered</b> plate). This <b>paper</b> presents a model that describes the behavior of this plate by a system of exact analytical (explicit) equations. An analytical model is preferred over finite element models and simplified formulas if it is fast and easy-to-use. Thus, modeling has been developed within the framework of two-dimensional elasticity, instead of three. In so doing, the model also represents a means for attaining full comprehension of the involved phenomena, something that neither three-dimensional elasticity nor finite element models and simplified formulas can attain. The two-dimensional behavior is governed here by using assumptions that do not impose constraints on the behavior. Starting from these assumptions, the paper illustrates the relationships between displacements and interface stresses. The subsequent sections of the paper describe the model and present some real case applications. The contribution {{of this paper is}} to consider both the shear modulus and the elastic modulus of the interlayer. Thus, this model applies to three-layered plates with any interlayer, whether utterly compliant or relatively stiff. Conversely, the previous exact analytical models assumed zero elastic modulus, and hence they applied to utterly compliant interlayers only. Hence, not only does the new model predict the exact behavior of plates that the former analytical models described only approximately, but this model may also be used as a benchmark for finite element models, which cannot assign zero value to the elasticity modulus of the interlayer together with the actual shear modulus...|$|R
