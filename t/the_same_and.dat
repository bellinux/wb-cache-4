5|$|A second {{competing}} {{theory for}} extratropical cyclone development over the oceans is the Shapiro-Keyser model, developed in 1990. Its main {{differences with the}} Norwegian Cyclone Model are the fracture of the cold front, treating warm-type occlusions and warm fronts as <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> <b>and</b> allowing the cold front to progress through the warm sector perpendicular to the warm front. This model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure, as seen in surface observations and in previous projects which used aircraft to determine the vertical structure of fronts across the northwest Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|A {{motif of}} father-against-son {{conflict}} was repeated when Cronus {{was confronted by}} his son, Zeus. Because Cronus had betrayed his father, he feared that his offspring would do <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> <b>and</b> so each time Rhea gave birth, he snatched up the child and ate it. Rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding Zeus and wrapping a stone in a baby's blanket, which Cronus ate. When Zeus was full grown, he fed Cronus a drugged drink which caused him to vomit, throwing up Rhea's other children and the stone, which {{had been sitting in}} Cronus's stomach all along. Zeus then challenged Cronus to war for the kingship of the gods. At last, {{with the help of the}} Cyclopes (whom Zeus freed from Tartarus), Zeus and his siblings were victorious, while Cronus and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in Tartarus.|$|E

5|$|Borussia's oppostition in the quarter-finals was Belgian champions Club Brugge. The {{first leg}} at the BÃ¶kelbergstadion saw Borussia concede two {{goals in the}} first half. However, they scored two goals {{in the second half}} {{courtesy}} of Christian Kulik and Allan Simonsen to secure a 2â2 draw. Despite this, Club Brugge had the advantage due to them having two away goals. Borussia knew that they had to score in the second leg at the Jan Breydel Stadium to have any chance of progressing to the semi-finals. The first half was goalless, and with six minutes of the second half remaining Wilfried Hannes scored the goal Borussia needed. The match finished 1â0 and a 3â2 aggregate victory meant they progressed to the semi-finals. Their opposition were Soviet champions Dynamo Kyiv. The first leg at the Central Stadium was won 1â0 by Dynamo. Borussia again needed to score to stay in the competition. Midway through the second half, Rainer Bonhof scored to make the tie 1â1 on aggregate. With eight minutes remaining and the tie heading for extra time, Hans-JÃ¼rgen Wittkamp scored to give Borussia a two-goal lead. The score remained <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>and</b> Borussia progressed to their first European Cup final with a 2â1 aggregate victory.|$|E
5|$|Conflicting Argentine and Chilean {{claims to}} Patagonia, a {{geographic}} {{region in the}} southernmost portion of South America, {{went back to the}} 1840s. In 1872 and again in 1878, Chilean warships seized merchant ships which had been licensed to operate in the disputed area by Argentina. An Argentine warship did the same to an American ship in 1877. These actions nearly led to war in November 1878, when Argentina dispatched a squadron of warships to the Santa Cruz River. Chile responded with <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> <b>and</b> war was only avoided when the FierroâSarratea treaty was hastily signed. Both countries were distracted {{in the next few years}} by Argentina's internal military operations against the indigenous population and Chile's War of the Pacific (Guerra del PacÃ­fico) against Bolivia and Peru, but by 1890 a full-fledged naval arms race was underway between the two.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{efforts to}} revive {{interest}} in the breed, numbers steadily declined {{in the years before}} 1988. In 1995, there were 33 stallions in service; in 1996 this number remained <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>and</b> by 1998 it had declined to 30. In 2004, there were 111 breeders and 119 Trait du Nord foals were registered. By 2007 and 2008 there were only 17 stallions registered, a number which is exposing the breed to a dangerous increase in inbreeding. To combat this danger, farmers are cross breeding the Trait du Nord with approved Belgian and Dutch horses. The number of farmers breeding the Trait du Nord decreased from 150 to 125 in 2002, then to 92 in 2007 and 86 in 2008. After birth rates remained relatively steady in the 1990s, they began to drop in the 2000s, declining from 176 in 2000 to 100 in 2005 and just 75 in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Evolution {{also does}} not require that organisms become more complex. Although the history of life shows an {{apparent}} trend towards the evolution of biological complexity; {{there is a question}} if this appearance of increased complexity is real, or if it comes from neglecting the fact that the majority of life on Earth has always consisted of prokaryotes. In this view, complexity is not a necessary consequence of evolution, but that specific circumstances of evolution on Earth frequently made greater complexity advantageous and thus naturally selected for. Depending on the situation, organisms' complexity can either increase, decrease, or stay <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> <b>and</b> all three of these trends have been observed in evolution.|$|E
5|$|For example, {{suppose the}} {{operator}} chose the message setting KYG for a message. The operator would first set the Enigma's rotors {{to the ground}} setting, which might be GBL on that particular day, and then encrypt the message setting on the Enigma twice; that is, the operator would enter KYGKYG (which might come out to something like QZKBLX). The operator would then reposition the rotors at KYG, and encrypt the actual message. A receiving operator could reverse the process to recover first the message setting, then the message itself. The repetition of the message setting was apparently meant as an error check to detect garbles, but it had the unforeseen effect of greatly weakening the cipher. Due to the indicator's repetition of the message setting, Rejewski knew that, in the plaintext of the indicator, the first and fourth letters were the same, the second and fifth were <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> <b>and</b> the third and sixth were the same. These relations could be exploited {{to break into the}} cipher.|$|E
5|$|Further details {{concerning}} Sejanus' fall {{are provided}} by Cassius Dio, writing nearly 200 years later in his Roman History. It appears that, when Tiberius heard to what extent Sejanus had already usurped his authority in Rome, he immediately took steps to remove him from power. However, he realised that an outright condemnation could provoke Sejanus to attempt a coup. Instead, Tiberius addressed a number of contradictory letters to the Senate, some of which praised Sejanus and his friends and some of which denounced them. Tiberius variously {{announced that he would}} arrive in Rome the next day or that he was at the point of death. He stepped down as consul, forcing Sejanus to do <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>and</b> conferred an honorary priesthood upon Caligula, rekindling popular support for the house of Germanicus. The ensuing confusion was successful in alienating Sejanus from many of his followers. With the intentions of the emperor no longer clear, it was now deemed a safer course of action at Rome to withdraw from overt support to Sejanus until the matter was clearly settled.|$|E
