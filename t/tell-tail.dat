50|$|In a {{nautical}} or sailing context a tell-tale, {{also known}} as a <b>tell-tail,</b> is a piece of yarn or fabric attached to a stay, any of several wires which hold a mast in place on a sailboat. they are used in pairs, {{on each side of the}} jib; there will be one <b>tell-tail</b> on the port stay and one on a starboard stay.|$|E
5000|$|Tell-tales {{can also}} be {{attached}} to a sail, used as a guide when trimming (adjusting) a sail. On the mainsail tell-tales may {{be placed on the}} leech (aft edge) and when trimmed properly should be streaming backwards while on a beat (upwind). When placed on the luff (forward or mast edge of the mainsail) they are used to indicate that the sail is luffing or coming head to wind. The solution is to bear away from the wind or sheet in. On the jib there may be tell-tales {{on both sides of the}} luff of the sail. As a general guide, the windward tell-tale should stream aft (backwards) with an occasional lift, the leeward front <b>tell-tail</b> should stream aft when on a beat to windward. If one <b>tell-tail</b> begins to spiral, it is indicating the sail has detached air flow on that side. To correct this the sail needs to move towards the opposite side. [...] "Tiller to tatteling tail" [...] is a good phrase to remember which direction to push the tiller when the tail is spiraling. Alternatively, the sail itself can be sheeted in or out towards the tell-tale which is not streaming.|$|E

40|$|The {{air flow}} {{patterns}} {{in an industrial}} milk powder spray dryer were investigated. Isothermal three-dimensional transient simulations were carried out using the commercial CFD code CFX 10. 0. The Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model was implemented to model the effects of turbulence. These simulations differ from previously published studies of spray dryer air flows in that they include features found in industrial scale plant. First, they include a second inlet air stream through the internal fluid bed {{at the bottom of}} the drying chamber. Second, the two outlet ducts are located near the top rather than the bottom of the dryer, which has been the case in most previous studies. It was found that the main air jet oscillated and precessed about the central axis. In turn, the recirculation zones between the main jet and the chamber walls fluctuated in size relative to the movement of the jet. Validation was achieved by observing the oscillation of the main air jet of a large dryer visualised by <b>tell-tail</b> tufts attached to a central pole...|$|E

The signal would be an anisotropy in the UHECR flux smaller than the <b>tell-tail</b> anisotropy towards the galactic center that would first establish unstable dark matter as the origin of the UHECR. Cosmic ray particles with energies above the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff [1] of about 5 × 10 19 eV have been detected by a number of independent experiments over the last decade [2]. The existence of these ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) presents us with a problem. Nucleons and photons with those energies have short attenuation lengths and could only come from distances of 100 Mpc or less, while plausible astrophysical sources for those energetic particles are much farther away. Recently, results from the HiRes Collaboration [3] brought the violation of the GZK cutoff into question and this issue will only be resolved conclusively by the Pierre Auger Observatory. Among the solutions proposed for the origin of the UHECR is the decay of supermassive relic particles which may constitute all or a fraction of the dark matter [4]. Such particles must be metastable, with lifetimes exceeding the age of the Universe. In this scenario the flux φ of UHECR coming from a particular volume element in the Universe is proportional 1 to the density of dark matter in this volume, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance r between us and this particular volume element. Thus the flux is the integral of the column density over the solid angle φ ∼...|$|E
