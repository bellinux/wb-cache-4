5|$|White's Natural History {{was at once}} well {{received}} by contemporary critics and the public, and continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> by a diverse range of nineteenth and twentieth century literary figures including Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas Carlyle, Charles Darwin, John Ruskin, Virginia Woolf, and W. H. Auden. His work {{has been seen as}} an early contribution to ecology and in particular to phenology. The book has been enjoyed for its charm and apparent simplicity, and the way that it creates a vision of pre-industrial England.|$|E
5|$|Further {{recognition}} {{came with}} the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung {{at the same time}} included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> for its colour scheme... The details of the picture disclose untiring care.|$|E
5|$|In {{the south}} of England private castles were being built by newly emerging, wealthy families; like the work at Windsor, these castles drew on the {{architectural}} themes of earlier martial designs, but were not intended to form a serious defence against attack. These new castles were heavily influenced by French designs, involving a rectangular or semi-rectangular castle with corner towers, gatehouses and moat; the walls effectively enclosing a comfortable courtyard plan not dissimilar to that of an unfortified manor. Bodiam Castle built in the 1380s possessed a moat, towers and gunports but, rather than being a genuine military fortification, the castle was primarily intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> by visitors and used as a luxurious dwelling – the chivalric architecture implicitly invoking comparisons with Edward I's great castle at Beaumaris.|$|E

5000|$|What, then, is the {{difference}} between an admirer and an imitator? An imitator <b>is</b> or strives <b>to</b> <b>be</b> what he <b>admires,</b> and an admirer keeps himself personally detached, consciously or unconsciously does not discover that what <b>is</b> <b>admired</b> involves a claim upon him, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> or at least <b>to</b> strive <b>to</b> <b>be</b> what <b>is</b> <b>admired.</b> Søren Kierkegaard ...|$|R

'Yes; but {{she will}} forgive us the minute we say Napoleon, for that bad little man {{is one of her}} heroes,' added Mat, pretending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>admiring</b> the view, while she privately {{examined}} a lady in a bower below--a stout, dark lady, with all the family traits so strongly marked that there could be no doubt of the young man's assertion.|$|R
25|$|Asgard is {{the name}} of a fictional wonder-city, a city {{constructed}} by the Oligarchy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> and appreciated as well as lived in. Thousands of proletarians live in poverty there, and are used whenever a public work needs to be completed, such as the building of a levee or a canal.|$|E
25|$|The genre {{has always}} been {{accepted}} in the mainstream youth culture but hindrances {{came in the form}} of changing governments, cultural conservatism, foreign influences and a stiff competition from neighbouring countries. Still, pop music thrived and survived with a steady growth.

25|$|Bland had {{established}} the League of the Empire, devoted to bringing all the units of Overseas Great Britain into touch, mainly by the observance of Empire day in schools, at Malacca. Upon its inauguration there a Chinese Malaccan Ong Kim Wee founded a fund {{to provide an}} annual prize on Empire Day, to be competed for by the English-speaking boys of Malacca. The $600 he gave to this, would produce about $40 a year {{to be used for}} the purchase of prizes that the elder boys could compete for. A newspaper reporting on that in September 19006, also noted that Bland, unlike the heads of government at the other two Settlements was not someone <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> from a distance but had personal relationships with many of the local community who view him as their head.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{examination}} of the philosophical and political legacy of John Desmond Bernal. It addresses the evidence of an emerging consensus on Bernal based on the recent biography of Bernal by Andrew Brown and the reviews it has received. It takes issue with this view of Bernal, which tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>admiring</b> of his scientific contribution, bemused by his sexuality, condescending to his philosophy and hostile to his politics. This article is a critical defence of his philosophical and political position...|$|R
25|$|The Polish {{nobility of}} the Commonwealth had become {{excessively}} dominant, and its primary {{aim was to}} remain in power. The lower and middle classes were often exploited and heavily taxed by wealthy or influential families of that era. This created a sense of fear among citizens of towns and villages that were privately owned by nobles. Sigismund, as the Head of State, always sought to restrict the privileges of the upper classes and decrease the nobility's influence over the parliament in order to personally gain control. This caused disdain for the monarch and many rebellions occurred during his reign. These revolts, however, were all crushed by Sigismund and the nobles eventually surrendered, having achieved little. Furthermore, one of Sigismund's desires was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> and idolized by his subjects; the unsuccessful rebellions were significant in strengthening his influence over {{the people and the}} country's politics. The Sejm (parliament), however, still was directly responsible {{for the majority of the}} Commonwealth's affairs, most notably declaring wars and suing for peace.|$|E
25|$|Fulgentius’s work {{is said to}} {{mark the}} {{transition}} from late-antique to Medieval literary study. After a period of decreased interest in the literature, the practice of mythography was picked up again in what {{is thought to be}} the 7th century by the so-called Vatican Mythographers. All three writers borrow Fulgentius’s methods in order to search the classical myths for obscured meaning. However, it was during the Carolingian period, from the 8th through to the 10th centuries, that Fulgentius’s work reached the height of its popularity. He came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> as one of the founding fathers of mythographic writing, and he was praised for uniting classical pagan literature and Christian teachings. This admiration led to the emergence of Fulgentian scholarship. The practice of differentiating between the author’s intention and the deeper meaning of a piece of literature -- carried to the extreme by Fulgentius -- provided the framework for the commentaries of this period. The Mythologies in particular proved to be an essential storehouse of resources for the Medieval commentators who carried on his tradition of discussing classical poetry in moral terms. Further, his exotic language and use of rare words seemed to influence the writing style of a number of poets throughout the Middle Ages.|$|E
500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule in 1970 dismissed complaints made at {{the time}} of issuance that the Indian was too thin: [...] "the Indian is far from emaciated, and the coins show more imagination and daring of design than almost any other issue in American history. [...] Pratt deserves <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> for his medals and coins." [...] Vermeule suggests that Pratt's design [...] "marked a transition, in the 'emaciated' Indian at least, to naturalism".|$|E

Kira buys a dress for Haneek that Haneek seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>admiring</b> when the universal-translator was not yet functioning.

500|$|Another of the novel's goals was {{to dispel}} the common {{perception}} of predators as evil and portray them as creatures <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> and empathized with. [...] "Being a top predator is difficult," [...] Bakker said, noting that fossils of big predators often show multiple broken and healed bones, as well as signs of serious infections, all evidence of a harsh lifestyle. He continued, [...] "Most predators had some trauma, they had been beaten up—for a simple reason: Dinner fights back." [...] The behavior of the raptors and other animals featured in the novel {{was based on a}} combination of fossil evidence and observations of modern animals, such as chimpanzees and alligators.|$|E
500|$|Charles {{had been}} in poor health for some time. After going {{shopping}} on a chilly day in Funchal to buy toys for Carl Ludwig, {{he was struck by}} an attack of bronchitis. This rapidly worsened into pneumonia, not helped by the inadequate medical care available. Several of the children and staff were also ill, and Zita (at the time eight months pregnant) helped nurse them all. Charles weakened and died on 1 April, his last words to his wife being [...] "I love you so much." [...] After his funeral, a witness said of Zita [...] "This woman really is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>admired.</b> She did not, for one second, lose her composure... she greeted the people on all sides and then spoke to those who had helped out with the funeral. They were all under her charm." [...] Zita wore mourning black in Charles's memory throughout sixty-seven years of widowhood.|$|E
500|$|The house {{remained}} unaltered {{for much}} of the 18th century, in contrast to most of the other principal seats in the county. It was described in 1769 as [...] "a square of very old date ... more <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> now for its antiquity than elegance or conveniency." [...] Work was carried out during the 1780s and '90s for John Crewe (later the first Baron Crewe). A service wing to the west in a Jacobean revival style was added to the hall in 1780. The principal interiors of the old building were redecorated in neo-Classical style at this time, although the original layout with great hall, long gallery and drawing room was retained. Improvements were made to the wine cellars and bedrooms in 1783, and J. Cheney was employed to build a new attic staircase and seven bedrooms in 1796. Edmund Burke wrote in 1788, [...] "I am vastly pleased with this place. We build no such houses in our time." [...] The second Lord Palmerston, visiting in the same year, wrote: ...|$|E

500|$|Diarmaid Ferriter {{selected}} {{the book as}} his pick in The Sunday Business Post feature [...] "Authors' choices". Ferriter commented: [...] "Rogan has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> for his perseverance and determination {{when it comes to}} chronicling {{the life and times of}} contrary musical giants – having previously tackled Morrissey. Well-researched biography is always to be encouraged, particularly when dealing with a difficult and elusive character". David Sinclair, author of Wannabe: How The Spice Girls Reinvented Pop Fam, reviewed the book for The Guardian, and commented: [...] "Rogan's scrutiny of Morrison's work is undertaken with no less care than that devoted to the details of the singer's life story, and the analysis and appreciation of Morrison's very real accomplishments as a musician provide some welcome ballast to a personal portrayal that is otherwise almost comically unflattering. Rogan's book certainly sheds new light on the life and times of this puzzling and reclusive performer." [...] Sinclair also noted the book takes a negative tone towards some of Morrison's mannerisms, and concluded his review with: [...] "But it may be as well to get hold of a copy before Morrison's legal representatives have had a chance to get out their fine-tooth combs." ...|$|E
500|$|The writer Friedrich Schiller (four {{of whose}} plays were adapted as operas by Verdi) {{distinguished}} {{two types of}} artist in his 1795 essay On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin ranked Verdi in the 'naïve' category—"They are not...self-conscious. They do not...stand aside to contemplate their creations and express their own feelings....They are able...if they have genius, to embody their vision fully." [...] (The 'sentimentals' seek to recreate nature and natural feelings on their own terms—Berlin instances Wagner—"offering not peace, but a sword.") Verdi's operas are not written according to an aesthetic theory, or with a purpose to change the tastes of their audiences. In conversation with a German visitor in 1887 he is recorded as saying that, whilst [...] "there was much <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> in [...] Tannhäuser and Lohengrin...in his recent operas [...] seemed to be overstepping the bounds {{of what can be}} expressed in [...] music. For him [...] "philosophical" [...] music was incomprehensible." [...] Although Verdi's works belong, as Rosselli admits [...] "to the most artificial of genres... ring emotionally true: truth and directness make them exciting, often hugely so." ...|$|E
500|$|Patton led the {{division}} during the Tennessee Maneuvers in June 1941, and was lauded for his leadership, executing 48 hours' worth of planned objectives in only nine. During the September Louisiana Maneuvers, his division {{was part of}} the losing Red Army in Phase I, but in Phase II was assigned to the Blue Army. His division executed a [...] end run around the Red Army and [...] "captured" [...] Shreveport, Louisiana. During the October–November Carolina Maneuvers, Patton's division captured Hugh Drum, commander of the opposing army. On January 15, 1942 he was given command of I Armored Corps, and the next month established the Desert Training Center in the Imperial Valley to run training exercises. He commenced these exercises in late 1941 and continued them into the summer of 1942. Patton chose a [...] expanse of desert area about [...] southeast of Palm Springs. From his first days as a commander, Patton strongly emphasized the need for armored forces to stay in constant contact with opposing forces. His instinctive preference for offensive movement was typified by an answer Patton gave to war correspondents in a 1944 press conference. In response to a question on whether the Third Army's rapid offensive across France should be slowed {{to reduce the number of}} U.S. casualties, Patton replied, [...] "Whenever you slow anything down, you waste human lives." [...] It was around this time that a reporter, after hearing a speech where Patton said that it took [...] "blood and brains" [...] to win in combat, began calling him [...] "blood and guts". The nickname would follow him for the rest of his life. Soldiers under his command were known at times to have quipped, [...] "our blood, his guts". Nonetheless, he was known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> widely by the men under his charge. Patton was also known simply as [...] "The Old Man" [...] among his troops.|$|E
50|$|The {{works by}} which Clari {{distinguished}} himself pre-eminently are his vocal duets and trios, with a basso continuo, published between 1740 and 1747. These compositions, which combine graceful melody with contrapuntal learning, <b>were</b> much <b>admired</b> by Luigi Cherubini. They appear <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>admired</b> by Handel also, {{since he did}} not hesitate to make appropriations from them. Clari composed one opera, Il Savio delirante, produced at Bologna in 1695, and a large quantity of church music, several specimens of which were printed in Vincent Novello's Fitzwilliam Music.|$|R
50|$|The {{penalty for}} robbery with {{violence}} was hanging, and most notorious English highwaymen ended on the gallows. The chief place of execution for London and Middlesex was Tyburn Tree.
