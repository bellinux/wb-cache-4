5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? <b>There</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E
25|$|Balls {{of solid}} glass {{occasionally}} {{were used in}} a method purported to prevent lightning strikes to ships and other objects. The idea was that glass objects, being non-conductors, are seldom struck by lightning. Therefore, goes the theory, <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> about glass that repels lightning. Hence the best method for preventing a lightning strike to a wooden ship was to bury a small solid glass ball in {{the tip of the}} highest mast. The random behavior of lightning combined with observers' confirmation bias ensured that the method gained a good bit of credence even after the development of the marine lightning rod soon after Franklin's initial work.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} {{to believe that}} the development of theory of mind is closely intertwined with language development in humans. One meta-analysis showed a moderate to strong correlation (r = 0.43) between performance on theory of mind and language tasks. One might argue that this relationship is due solely to the fact that both language and theory of mind seem to begin to develop substantially around the same time in children (between ages 2–5). However, many other abilities develop during this same time period as well, and do not produce such high correlations with one another nor with theory of mind. <b>There</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> else going on to explain the relationship between theory of mind and language.|$|E

25|$|It is {{nonsensical}} and counter-intuitive {{to believe}} that Nature (or God) created human life only {{to allow it to}} end after a definite period of time. A human being must be able to live indefinitely, or to put it in another way, it {{should not be allowed to}} die through ageing. <b>There</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> inside us, that can be modified (perhaps at conception) that will shift the entire death pathway into another, parallel pathway, that will have no predetermined end. This ‘something’ is in fact, the evolutionary impetus to achieve higher levels of complexity in the quickest way possible. There should be a way to enhance this process and accelerate our transition from the process of evolution by natural selection to a post-Darwinian, transhumanist domain where indefinite life-spans are the norm.|$|E
500|$|Obama's family history, upbringing, and Ivy League {{education}} differ markedly {{from those}} of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation {{in the civil rights}} movement. Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is [...] "black enough", Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that [...] "we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> wrong." [...] Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: [...] "I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} in 1993, Folkvord said his most important commitment if he gained a seat in parliament was giving the National trade union centers more power {{so that they could}} better defend the working class. When asked if it was exhausting to promote socialist reforms Folkvord said, [...] "It is. But I think in some ways easier than before [...] fake socialist regimes have collapsed". Another opinion of his was that [...] "capitalism destroys the natural environment around us making the bourgeois society planners understand that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> new in the future. This provides inspiration to win support for socialist beliefs in Norway". Folkvord's first contact with anti-capitalist beliefs came when he joined the Workers' Communist Party. The party told him about [...] "capitalist barbarism" [...] and how the wealthy controlled everything. Folkvord said he believed that [...] " [...] can't be the end of human development", and that he believes humans are destined to create another more-just system.|$|E

500|$|Alcohol was {{not allowed}} in the Maharishi's ashram, but Mardas smuggled some in from Dehra Dun, and later {{reported}} to Lennon and Harrison that the Maharishi {{had sex with a}} young American student, and had made a sexual advance toward Mia Farrow. This was not supported in Farrow's autobiography What Falls Away (1997), in which she wrote that she may have misinterpreted the supposed sexual advance. Mardas continued to insist the Maharishi was not what he said he was; even making Harrison unsure. Lennon mused in 1970: [...] "Well, it must be true, because if George [...] is doubting him, <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> in it". Lennon and Harrison confronted the Maharishi, but the startled Maharishi's answers did not satisfy them, and they decided to leave the camp. Mardas insisted that they (Lennon, Harrison and their respective wives) must leave the camp at once, or the Maharishi might send down some [...] "black magic" [...] on them. Mardas then went down to Dehra Dun to organise taxis for the next morning to take them all to Delhi.|$|E
500|$|The 59th Division {{was rushed}} to Ireland in {{response}} to the Easter Rising of April 1916, where Blackader's new brigade saw its first active service. Following the Rising, many of those believed by the British authorities to be responsible were tried by military courts; ninety were sentenced to death, of whom fifteen were eventually executed. Blackader, as a senior officer, chaired a number of courts-martial, including those of Éamonn Ceannt, Thomas Clarke, Thomas MacDonagh, Patrick Pearse, and Joseph Plunkett, five of the seven signatories to the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. It appears that Blackader found this task difficult; after Pearse's trial, he is reported to have commented that [...] "I have just done one of the hardest tasks I have ever had to do. I have had to condemn to death one of the finest characters I have ever come across. <b>There</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> very wrong in the state of things that makes a man like that a rebel. I don't wonder that his pupils adored him." ...|$|E
500|$|David Giler {{performed}} a rewrite; Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins, friends of Spielberg, suggested the plot device of a kidnapped child. Spielberg {{then began to}} write the script. The song [...] "When You Wish upon a Star" [...] from Pinocchio influenced Spielberg's writing style. [...] "I hung my story on the mood the song created, the way it affected me personally." [...] Jerry Belson and Spielberg wrote the shooting script together. In the end, Spielberg was given solo writing credit. During pre-production, the title was changed from Kingdom Come to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. J. Allen Hynek, who worked with the United States Air Force on Project Blue Book, {{was hired as a}} scientific consultant. Hynek felt [...] "even though the film is fiction, it's based for the most part on the known facts of the UFO mystery, and it certainly catches the flavor of the phenomenon. Spielberg was under enormous pressure to make another blockbuster after Jaws, but he decided to make a UFO movie. He put his career on the line." [...] USAF and NASA declined to cooperate on the film. In fact, NASA reportedly sent a 20-page letter to Spielberg, telling him that releasing the film was dangerous. In an interview, he said: [...] "I really found my faith when I heard that the Government was opposed to the film. If NASA took the time to write me a 20-page letter, then I knew <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> happening." ...|$|E

500|$|Levin was {{a bright}} child and, {{encouraged}} by his mother, he worked hard enough to win a scholarship to the independent school Christ's Hospital in the countryside near Horsham, West Sussex. His housemaster was D. S. ("Boom") Macnutt, the school's head of Classics. Macnutt was a strict, even bullying, teacher, and was feared rather than loved by his pupils, but Levin learned Classics well, and retained a lifelong love of Latin tags and quotations in his writing. He battled on many fronts at Christ's Hospital: he was a Jew at a Church of England establishment; he was from a poor family; he was slight of stature; he was utterly indifferent to sport; he adopted a Marxist stance, hanging the Red Flag from a school window to celebrate the Labour victory in 1945. In the local streets, the school's conspicuous uniform, including a cloak and tight stockings, attracted unwanted attention. Levin's biographer Bel Mooney writes of this period, [...] "Jeers put iron in his soul". Among the consolations of Christ's Hospital was its thriving musical life. At concerts by the school orchestra (whose members included Levin's contemporary, Colin Davis), Levin listened seriously to music for the first time. The food at the school was no such consolation; according to Levin it was so appalling that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> better to be found, and from his late teens he sought out the best restaurants he could afford.|$|E
500|$|... "Locomotion", Minogue's {{first single}} release, spent seven weeks at {{number one on}} the Australian singles chart, and was the highest-selling single in the country for the 1980s. This version of [...] "Locomotion" [...] is often aired on VH-1 Europe. It, however, was only an Australian release and was not part of her debut album project until re-recorded for release in 1988. [...] "I Should Be So Lucky" [...] was the first single from the album and {{featured}} lyrics written by Mike Stock. Stock believed that although Minogue was a successful soap star in Australia and very talented, <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> wrong with her and figured that she must be unlucky in love. It became a number one hit for Minogue in Australia and the United Kingdom. [...] "Got to Be Certain", the second single, reached number one in Australia, and was moderately successful {{in other parts of the}} world, reaching number two in the UK for three weeks and the top ten in Germany and Switzerland. Minogue re-recorded [...] "Locomotion" [...] in April 1988, retitling the song [...] "The Loco-Motion". It was released as the album's third single and became the highest entry of the UK singles chart by a female artist. In North America, it reached number one in Canada and number three on the Billboard Hot 100. [...] "Je ne sais pas pourquoi", the fourth single, reached number two in the UK. [...] "It's No Secret" [...] was released as the album's fifth single in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, North America, and Japan where it was the fourth single. [...] "Turn It into Love" [...] was exclusively released in Japan as the fifth single and spent 10 weeks at Number 1 with no promotion or video.|$|E
500|$|A {{common law}} rule from Great Britain permits {{searches}} incident to an arrest without a warrant. This rule {{has been applied}} in American law, and has a lengthy common law history. The justification for such a search is to prevent the arrested individual 1.) from destroying evidence or 2.) using a weapon against the arresting officer by disarming the suspect. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that [...] "both justifications for the search-incident-to-arrest exception are absent and the rule does not apply", when [...] "there is no possibility" [...] that the suspect could gain access to a weapon or destroy evidence. In Trupiano v. United States (1948), the Supreme Court held that [...] "a search or seizure without a warrant as an incident to a lawful arrest has always been {{considered to be a}} strictly limited right. It grows out of the inherent necessities of the situation {{at the time of the}} arrest. But <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> more in the way of necessity than merely a lawful arrest." [...] In United States v. Rabinowitz (1950), the Court reversed Trupiano, holding instead that the officers' opportunity to obtain a warrant was not germane to the reasonableness of a search incident to an arrest. Rabinowitz suggested that any area within the [...] "immediate control" [...] of the arrestee could be searched, but it did not define the term. In deciding Chimel v. California (1969), the Supreme Court elucidated its previous decisions. It held that when an arrest is made, it is reasonable for the officer to search the arrestee for weapons and evidence. However, in Riley v. California (2014), the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that police must obtain a warrant to search an arrestee's cellular phone. The Court said that earlier Supreme Court decisions permitting searches incident to an arrest without a warrant do not apply to [...] "modern cellphones, which are now such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important feature of human anatomy," [...] and noted that US citizens' cellphones today typically contain [...] "a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives — from the mundane to the intimate." ...|$|E

Bogart was proud of his success, but the fact that it came from playing a gangster weighed on him.

2500|$|The first {{scientific}} study of available evidence was conducted by John Napier and published in his book, Bigfoot: The Yeti and Sasquatch in Myth and Reality, in 1973.

[...] However, he {{found it difficult to}} entirely reject thousands of alleged tracks, [...] "scattered over 125,000 square miles" [...] (325,000km²) or to dismiss all [...] "the many hundreds" [...] of eyewitness accounts. Napier concluded, [...] "I am convinced that Sasquatch exists, but whether it is all it is cracked up to be is another matter altogether. <b>There</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> in north-west America that needs explaining, and that something leaves man-like footprints." ...|$|E

[...] Black Sabbath bandmate Tony Iommi said that, while all the band were involved with {{alcohol and other}} drugs to various degrees in the 1970s, Osbourne had the unhealthiest lifestyle of them all.

However the authors say {{that this is not a}} reason to expect the universe to collapse, because if such mini black holes can be created in collisions, they would also be created in the much more energetic collisions of cosmic radiation particles with planetary surfaces. And if there are primordial mini black holes they should have triggered the vacuum decay long ago.
