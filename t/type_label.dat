Each cell is also assigned a storm <b>type</b> <b>label</b> as determined by ground observers of the actual storm. Many of these products are computed using rules that incorporate threshold values.

In order to have a nice interaction between reduction and typing, some reduction rules have to be accompanied with a type modification by generalizing or instantiating types...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{procedure}} to update existing mapping from a classified {{image in the}} Mary River floodplain of the Northern Territory, Australia. This procedure explicitly rests {{on the assumption that}} the spatial distribution of land cover types depicted in the reference cover type mapping is "still mostly correct", (and contains sufficient still-valid information to train a classification of a more recent image), with a view to updating the cover type mapping. Empirical probabilities of spectral class to cover type were estimated from GIS overlay of a classified TM image over existing mapping. Cover types are additionally characterised as mosaics of characteristic (template) textures. The image texture of a window around each pixel was estimated and compared for similarity to the GIS derived cover type texture templates. Pixels were labelled to the most 2 ̆ 7 likely 2 ̆ 7 cover type. The 2 ̆ 7 likelihood 2 ̆ 7 of a given cover <b>type</b> <b>label</b> was estimated by combining both the similarity of pixel neighbourhood texture and the the pixel spectral class probability of association to that cover type. The resulting map does not conform completely to the original mapping; however enough cover types do map to plausible locations to warrant continuing the investigation...|$|E

The description is brief and lacks many morphological details. Therefore, the holotype male, deposited in the Natural History Museum (NHM), London, United Kingdom, is redescribed below. The specimen is mounted on a minuten pin extending more or less vertically through the thorax between the mesal margins of the upper proepisterna and exiting the scutum anterior to the prescutellar area. The {{lower part of the}} minuten pin is inserted in a rectangular, yellow, plastic stage which is attached near its margin to an insect pin. Four labels are attached to the insect pin and include the following information: Finlaya lepchana Barr., % TYPE (handwritten in black ink except TYPE is typed on a red, paper, triangular label); terminalia ON SLIDE (hand printed in black ink on a white, paper, rectangular label); India: Tindaria, Darjiling Hills, IX. 1922, bamboos, Capt.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Remote sensing is {{the most}} {{practical}} way to acquire large amounts of land cover data for monitoring and understanding environmental change, so {{it is important to}} be able to map land cover from imagery. Maps defining land cover patches as polygons rather than pixels greatly improve processing efficiency in models and are often more relevant to the scale of biophysical processes. Defining boundaries around homogeneous patches of an image is called segmentation. Assigning a cover <b>type</b> <b>label</b> to a pixel or polygon is called classification. Accuracy of maps generated from images is generally specified in terms of classification accuracy with no specification of spatial distribution of error. We demonstrate need for spatial accuracy assessment by showing that even small classification error rates can cause large changes in a standard landscape statistic, average patch compaction (APC). Furthermore, the common practice of reducing classification error by forcing a minimum mapping unit size can increase error in APC. We also investigate the importance of segmentation evaluation functions as the basis for scientific decisions, comparing algorithms, and driving optimizers. We divide these functions into reference-based (scores are derived through comparison to a "correct" reference segmentation) and heuristic (scores are based on attributes of the image without knowledge of a reference). We quantitatively measure performance of several evaluation functions embedded in a region merging algorithm on ecological images where hand segmentations are available. We explain their poor performance by showing that deterministic, irreversible segmentation algorithms like region merging can only represent n of 2 [superscript n] possible segmentations for an initial segmentation containing n boundaries, suggesting that evaluation functions must be learned. We demonstrate a reference-based evaluation function as a target for learning. It achieves near optimal performance inside a region merging algorithm, showing that poor evaluation functions, not greedy algorithms, limit performance in region merging. Finally, we describe a prototype segmentation editing tool we built to simplify generating hand segmentations. This work is of interest to landscape ecologists computing metrics from maps derived from images, to remote sensing scientists evaluating their efforts in generating those maps, and to developers of segmentation algorithms and evaluation functions...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the {{potential}} of labeling products with life cycle greenhouse gas emission information as a bottom-up, complementary alternative to carbon cap and trade systems. By improving the transparency of product carbon footprint information, a market for low carbon intensity products can be created. The conduct of such product life cycle assessments often allows companies to uncover cost effective emission reduction opportunities typically {{in the order of}} 10 %- 20 %. Society benefits both from the increased supply chain efficiency of these companies as well as the heightened awareness of climate change among consumers as companies communicate these information to them. An examination {{of the history of the}} development of the nutritional label and various eco-labels in the U. S. highlights the importance of timely government intervention in setting guidelines and standards to prevent companies from misleading consumers with unsubstantiated product health or environmental claims. Case studies of current carbon labeling initiatives worldwide demonstrate the benefits of government affiliation in building credibility during their early stages. This affiliation helps in attracting the participation of large established companies who provide strong reinforcing effects that are crucial to the growth and success of new initiatives. There is still lack of consensus about the ideal format for a carbon label. A seal of approval <b>type</b> <b>label</b> could be ideal to attract companies in the initial stages which can later be succeeded by an information disclosure based format as more consumers start to understand the meaning of product carbon footprints in the future. (cont.) Voluntary public private partnerships have been used extensively by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These partnerships can serve as a potential model for a future carbon labeling initiative in the U. S. The SmartWay Transport Partnership is highlighted as a successful program both in terms of membership growth and emissions saved. System Dynamics modeling is applied as a tool to aid in understanding how the structure of such programs is critical to their success and is demonstrated as a method to potentially quantify the benefits of these programs prior to their actual implementation. by Kwan Chong Tan.

40|$|A few New Zealand Crambinae were {{described}} by Doubleday (1843), Walker (1863; 1864; 1866), Zeller (1863; 1877), Felder (1875) and Butler (1877). In this early work {{the same species}} were often described nearly simultaneously {{by as many as}} three authors, leading to much confusion in nomenclature. The first attempts at a systematic presentation of the New Zealand Crambinae. were made by Meyrick (1882; 1883; 1885; 1888), who also studied the Australian and Pacific Island Crambinae in the same period (1879; 1882 a; 1886; 1897). His New Zealand studies culminated in the first revision of the group (1912 a). In his descriptions, and in the revision, he relied almost entirely on the venation, forewing pattern and palpi structure for taxonomic characters. The great majority of the New Zealand Crambinae were grouped by Meyrick into the Palaearctic genus Crambus F. and the neotropical genus Diptychophora Zeller. He also erected an endemic genus Orocrambus (now attributed to Purdie, see later) to include a few alpine species. His type series were almost invariably specimens from the collections of G. V. Hudson in Wellington and R. W. Fereday in Christchurch. The first systematic examination of New Zealand Crambine genitalia was carried out by Philpott (1929), who figured 68 sets of genitalia. In this paper Philpott queried the validity of a few of Meyrick's species, but accepted his generic classification. Unfortunately the value of this paper (which deals with male genitalia only) to present day workers is much reduced by 10 name caption errors in the 68 figures. These are not merely spelling errors; several pairs of species names have become substituted, probably through errors in the original slide labelling. The confusion is compounded by two serious errors in his Crambus key. While basically a very valuable piece of work, Philpott's paper should not be used for Crambine male identification by anyone not fairly familiar with the genera concerned. However it can be used cautiously in conjunction with the very useful colour illustrations in Hudson's volumes (1928; 1939; 1951); as then some of the errors become obvious. During {{the last decade or so}} Bleszynski has revised the Palaeartic Crambinae (1965) and revised or begun to revise major genera in the Ethiopean Region (1964), the Old World tropics (1963 b) and the Neotropical Region (1960 a; 1966; 1967). A review of the world crambine genera and their types (1963 a), and a catalogue of the known world species (Bleszynski and Collins, 1962) have also been very valuable contributions making the studies of regional workers, such as the present author, much easier. The overall classification of the Crambinae is still in some confusion. In the present work I have outlined and discussed what I think are the major characters dividing the subfamily above the generic level, and considered the relationships of this subfamily with the Scopariinae and Pyraustinae, an area of study where much more investigation and clarification is needed. All 80 known New Zealand species of Crambinae have been re-examined in the present study, and a preliminary re-examination and revision of 11 endemic Australian species has also been carried out. The latter study, although incomplete, has yielded valuable information concerning origins and relationships of the New Zealand Crambinae while the New Zealand studies have in turn suggested the line that a revision of the large and important Australian genus Hednota should take. My work has been made much easier by Dr. S. Bleszynski who has checked the types of the New Zealand Crambinae held in the British Natural History Museum collection and freely supplied me with his invaluable sketches of type genitalia; the efforts of Mr. P.
