50|$|Freight {{transport}} {{has undergone}} similar changes, increasing in volume and shifting from railways onto the road. In 1953 89 billion <b>tonne</b> <b>kilometres</b> of goods were moved, with rail accounting for 42%, road 36% and water 22%.

Despite the growth in <b>tonne</b> <b>kilometres,</b> the environmental external costs of trucks and lorries in the UK have reportedly decreased. Between 1990 and 2000, {{there has been a}} move to heavier goods vehicles due to major changes in the haulage industry including a shift in sales to larger articulated vehicles.

40|$|This thesis {{offers an}} {{overview}} of relevant market definition in the sea transport sector. The author examines the sea transport sector {{through the eyes of}} Article 82 EC and its inherent concept of relevant market definition. Two main questions are answered in this thesis: 1) How is the relevant market in the sea transport sector defined in EC competition law? 2) What must shipping companies take into consideration when defining it? The Community’s goal for the future of EC maritime trade is to – {{with the help of the}} Marco Polo programme –shift billions of <b>tonnes</b> <b>kilometres</b> from land transport services to sea transport services making transport in the Community more environmentally sound. The shifting consists of tens of per cent of <b>tonnes</b> <b>kilometres</b> which will naturally increase the frequency and thus importance of sea transport. It is the author’s view that along with this increase in sea borne trade will follow an increased amount of cases before the Commission, the Community Courts with regard to shipping and competition. Due to this future increase and due to the lack of Community case law on relevant market definition as regards the sea transport sector, the author’s finds that there is an acute need for an analysis with regard to this area. The thesis encompasses both relevant product market definition and relevant geographic market definition and encompasses six chapters. The first four chapters offer the reader an introduction to the concept of competition, {{an overview of}} competition law in the EC especially with regard to relevant market definition. The fifth chapter shows how the relevant market may be defined in the sea transport sector by examining how relevant markets have been defined in the case law of the Community Courts and how this market has been assessed by the Commission.

50|$|In June 1984, BCal's {{original}} proposal {{to share out}} BA's routes ahead of the latter's privatisation was followed up by a plan BCal had jointly formulated with eight other UK independent airlines.

Measured in terms of capacity <b>tonne</b> <b>kilometres</b> (CTKs), it would have increased the independents' share from 17% to 40% while reducing BA's share from 83% to 60%. For BCal alone this would have doubled its share from 15% to 30%. In their submission the independents claimed that privatising BA in its existing shape would allow it to dominate and destroy its competition. They also regarded BA's continuing dominance as incompatible with the CAA's goal of a less-regulated air transport market. BA countered the independents' contentions by maintaining that rather than benefiting consumers through increased competition, the independents' intent generally, and BCal's in particular, would merely result in substituting its own services with those of other carriers.|$|R
40|$|Forecasting {{the demand}} for freight {{transport}} is notoriously difficult. Although ever more advanced modelling techniques are becoming available, there is little data available for calibration. Compared to passenger travel, there are many fewer decision makers in freight, especially for the main bulk commodities, so the decisions of {{a relatively small number}} of principal players greatly influence the outcome. Moreover, freight comes in various shapes, sizes and physical states, which require different handling methods and suit the various modes (and sub-modes) of transport differently. In the face of these difficulties, present DTp practice is to forecast Britain's freight traffic using a very simple aggregate approach which assumes that <b>tonne</b> <b>kilometres</b> will rise in proportion to GDP. Although this simple model fits historical data quite well, there is a clear danger that this relationship will not hold good in the future. The relationship between <b>tonne</b> <b>kilometres</b> and GDP depends on the mix of products produced, their value to weight ratios, number of times lifted and lengths of haul. In the past, a declining ratio of tonnes to GDP has been offset by increasing lengths of haul. This has come about through a complicated set of changes in product mix, industrial structure and distribution systems. A more disaggregate approach which studies changes in all these factors by industrial sector seems likely to provide a better understanding of the relationship between <b>tonne</b> <b>kilometres</b> and GDP. However, there are also problems with disaggregation. As we disaggregate we get more understanding of what might change in the future, but are less able to project trends forward. This can be seen if we consider the future amounts of coal movements. Theoretically there is clearly scope for better forecasting by allowing for past trends to be overturned by a movement towards gas powered electricity generation and more imports of coal direct to coastal power stations. However, making such a sectoral forecast is extremely difficult, and inaccuracy here may more than offset the theoretical gain referred to earlier. This is because it is usually easier to forecast to a given percentage accuracy an aggregate rather than its components. For example, the percentage error on sales forecasts of Hotpoint washing machines will be greater than that for the sales of all washing machines taken together. This occurs because different makes of washing machines are substitutes for each other, so forecasts for Hotpoint washing machines must take into account uncertainty over Hotpoint's market share as well as uncertainty over the future total sales of washing machines. Nevertheless, a disaggregate investigation of the market could spot trends which were `buried' in the aggregate figures. For example, rapidly declining sales for one manufacturer might indicate their leaving the market, which with less competition would then price up and so reduce the total future sales. We have assumed above that the use of the term disaggregate in the brief refers to disaggregation by industrial sector. An alternative usage of the word disaggregate in this context is when referring to modelling at the level of the individual decision making unit. Disaggregate freight modelling in this sense would involve analysing decisions in order to determine the utility weight attached to different attributes of available transport options. Because data on suitable decisions is not readily available in this country, due to commercial confidentiality, we have recently undertaken research in which we have presented decision makers with hypothetical choices, and obtained the necessary utility weights from their responses. Whilst initial scepticism is understandable, this method has produced results acceptable for use in major projects. ITS itself has provided algorithms (known as Leeds Adaptive Stated Preference) which have been used to derive utility weights for use by British Rail in forecasting cross-channel freight, by DTp in evaluating the reaction of commercial vehicles to toll roads, and by the Dutch Ministry of Transport in modelling freight in the Netherlands. In the light of the above, the following objectives were set for the feasibility study: (1) To determine if a forecasting approach disaggregated by industrial sectors, as under the first definition above, can be used to explain recent trends in freight transport; (2) To test the feasibility of the disaggregated approach for improving the understanding of likely future developments in freight markets, this being informed by current best understanding of the disaggregate decision-making process as under the second definition above...|$|R
40|$|In the {{underground}} mining industry, {{one of the}} long-term operational issues involves longer haulage routes as the mine gets deeper with the life of mine. This longer travel route has {{a great impact on}} the productivity and cost of the operation. Choosing the best haulage fleet will result in improved productivity and lower cost per tonne of material moved. For this reason, it has motivated Daisy Milano Gold Mine, owned by Silver Lake Resources, to analyse their current Toro 50 Plus trucks against the Atlas Copco MT 5010 truck. During a three month trial of both haulage options, trucking parameters were collected from a specifically designed trucking plod. This research used a time motion study to perform productivity calculations and cost analysis of the two haulage options.

In October 2011, the Department for Transport announced trials of extended length semi-trailers with the aim of investigating the impact of increasing {{the length of}} an articulated vehicle up to a new maximum of 18. 55 m, an increase of 2. 05 m. A number of countries in the European Union (EU) have opted to either permit or trial vehicles that are substantially longer than those currently permitted or under trial in the UK, with the extension of length often accompanied by an increase in the maximum gross weight of the vehicle. The European Commission is currently undertaking a review of the EU Directive that governs the weights and dimensions of vehicles operating in the EU. This study assesses the environmental, economic, safety and practical impacts of increasing the maximum length of vehicles in the UK to 25. 25 m, while maintaining the maximum gross weight at the current UK limit of 44 tonnes (with such a vehicle herein referred to as a ‘High Capacity Vehicle’ or ‘HCV’). The scope is limited to the consideration of 25. 25 m vehicle variants that are currently in use in the Netherlands. An increase in vehicle length, without any corresponding increase in gross weight of the vehicle is of particular benefit to transporters of low density goods that regularly fill the cubic capacity of a vehicle without accessing its full weight carrying capacity. The costs of transport of low density goods, when measured on a per tonne or per <b>tonne</b> <b>kilometre</b> basis, are significantly higher than for more dense goods. Analysis of UK road freight transport flows in this research suggests that there are significant opportunities for the use of HCVs for the carriage of low density goods.

The objective {{of this article is to}} describe the foundation framework (i. e. phase 1) for South Africa’s freight corridor performance measurement system (CPMS). Once populated, the CPMS will be a key generator of indicators to facilitate the systemic management of corridors as {{a national}} production factor and thereby contributing to South Africa’s competitiveness. Method: The design of South Africa’s CPMS was informed by desktop research and refined through an extensive stakeholder consultation process. A distinction was made between South Africa’s dedicated bulk corridors and the multi-modal corridors. Results: Facilitating both stakeholder involvement and agreement on key indicators, as well as the eventual development of a system supporting the population, aggregation and dissemination of the CPMS are critical outcomes for the management of corridors as a national production factor. Three overarching corridor indicators were defined, relating to increased throughput, lower costs and optimal modal application – the key rationale to improve the competitiveness of South African industry. This is supported by three corridor measurement perspectives, that is, a policy, customer service and infrastructure perspective. The purpose of the policy perspective is to support the role of national government in facilitating logistics competitiveness and equitable access through appropriate policy instruments. The customer service perspective should track service reliability and efficiency as contracted, at costs and cycle times that facilitate the competitiveness of the freight owner. The infrastructure perspective indicates whether sufficient capacity is provided, and whether this capacity is both available when required and utilised optimally. Conclusion: Elevation of logistics to the macroeconomic realm through the development of appropriate indicators will enable the management of logistics as a national production factor, thereby contributing to reducing national freight logistics costs and improving industry competitiveness. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the study has been to review the {{workings}} of the Waterways Freight Facilities Grant Scheme (Section 36 Grant). Views of industry and institutions regarding the use of canals for the movement of freight were obtained in a series of interviews, together with information on the workings of the Grant Scheme. Case studies were used to test the effect of possible changes to the Grant Scheme. During the period of the study the ramifications of the progress of the Rail Privatisation Bill through Parliament meant that the situation regarding the Section 8 Grant (the equivalent grant for rail freight facilities) has become somewhat fluid. Major revisions, extending the scheme to cover lorry miles saved on motorways, have been announced; an additional grant to cover track costs is also proposed for rail, but the method of application or assessment is not yet clear. In order to encourage more traffic to switch to using waterway in the medium term, we recommend that: -Section 36 Grants should be extended to cover the high quality road network (including motorways), and that a higher valuation should be placed on the benefits than in the case of Section 8 grants, reflecting the higher benefits of water transport relative to rail. -That a new "waterways operating grant" should be available to operators of waterway craft, also at a higher rate per <b>tonne</b> <b>kilometre</b> than the proposed rail track costs grant. -That the reduction in road accidents and congestion be taken into account when valuing the benefits of inland waterway transport. Even with these revisions, however, we conclude the Section 36 grants will have a modest effect, in general only diverting traffic to water where this does not involve transhipment. Also, few waterway flows offer the sort of long run contracts necessary to justify a grant. As a result, we conclude that, Section 36 Grants will have limited success in satisfying the Department of Transport's overall objective of causing goods to be moved by inland waterway as opposed to road "where this would be in the interest of any locality or of some or all of its inhabitants". In our view a more successful method of achieving the Department's objective in the long term would be to encourage firms receiving or despatching commodities suitable for carriage by inland waterway to locate in premises alongside the canal network. This is even more important where the company is engaged in the import of raw materials. Such a method would require changes to the guidelines on planning and industrial development...|$|R
