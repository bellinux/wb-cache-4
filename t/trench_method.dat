The reason for this probably is the very high cost - why reluctance {{on the part of the}} house-owners can be expected. It is the intention of this project to develop and test a device with which sewer connections can be replaced at low cost and which can also be used under difficult ground conditions as well as below ground-water level. Following well-established horizontal thrust-boring machines, a vertical boring machine was developed which works on the principle of <b>trenches</b> <b>methods.</b> It allows borings from ground level to the sewers in angles from 30 to 90. A new bore head was designed to control direction, and gauging techniques required for this were optimized. With the help of a pneumatic in-hole-hammer it is possible to use the machine even in difficult ground conditions like rock or stony ground. The efficiency of the prototype could be proven using it in-situ. A lot of investigations and tests were carried out for its use below ground-water level. Still, the process evolved in the laboratory has to be optimized further before it can be used in practice. (orig.)

40|$|The {{harvesting}} of Pandora moth larvae (Coloradia pandora lindseyi Barns and Benjamin), or piagi, by the Owens Valley Paiute {{and other}} native {{peoples of the}} Sierra Nevada of California, has attracted varied attention {{since the turn of}} the century. Early papers by entomologists, including Aldrich (1912, 1921), Eldredge (1923), Englehardt (1924), Patterson (1929), and Essig (1934), described the basic process, but were based more on hearsay than on direct observation. They thus created some fanciful impressions. Later ethnographic descriptions, such as those by Steward (1933) and Davis (1965), helped sort fact from fancy, although not completely, as they too were based on secondhand information rather than direct observation. In June, 1981, we observed elderly Paiute from Bishop, California, harvesting and processing Pandora moth larvae. At that time, cost/benefit checks were made on both collection and processing, to which basic nutritional data were added. That season the larvae were collected by hand rather than by the tree-base <b>trenching</b> <b>method</b> that is well attested in the archaeological and ethnographic records. In June, 1982, we planned some additional experiments with the <b>trenching</b> <b>method</b> of collection, in order to compare the basic efficiency of the two techniques.

40|$|Introduction. New {{ecological}} {{agricultural practices}} contribute to improved pest management and root development of pineapple, but tools {{to quantify the}} root development in cultural profiles in situ are lacking. The spatial distribution of the root length density (RLD) is a key factor for the absorption of water and nutrients. A robust model was sought to predict the RLD {{from the number of}} intersections of roots per unit area (RID) in a soil profile (<b>trench</b> <b>method).</b> Materials and methods. The procedure was based on the extraction of cubes of 1 dm 3 of undisturbed soil on profiles under pineapple plants in triplicate, in which the RID was counted on three perpendicular faces of the cubes and the RLD was measured inside the cubes. Results and discussion. A model predicting the RLD (RLDc) from counting of the RID was developed and successfully tested: RLDc = RID. CO.

The model allows an estimate of pineapple RLD and its spatial variability from simple counts of roots on a soil profile.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of innovative and sustainable solutions {{is a continuing}} concern within civil engineering activities. The use of environmentally friendly materials in place of traditional chemical substances is a key aspect. Biopolymers are high-molecular-weight molecules produced by many species of biological cells. Biopolymers are recognised {{as an alternative to}} conventional chemical polymers because of their potential cost savings, low environmental impact, non-toxicity and non-secondary pollution. Some geotechnical and geoenvironmental applications of biopolymers currently being explored include: cementation of soils to enhance strength; bearing capacity and liquefaction resistance; soil erosion control; reducing hydraulic conductivity; groundwater flow control and remediation of soil and groundwater impacted by metals and radionuclides. This paper reviews reported applications of biopolymers in dam construction and operation activities, highlighting some geotechnical applications that should be investigated further in practice to examine their feasibility and efficiency. The implementations discussed include the biopolymer <b>trench</b> <b>method</b> for construction of filters/drains, the biopolymer slurry technique for installation of permeable reactive barriers, and the treatment of highly turbid raw water in dam reservoirs by coagulation/flocculation processes using biopolymers.

40|$|The {{switch from}} {{shifting}} cultivation to more permanent highland cropping systems in northern Thailand {{led to an}} increase in soil tillage intensity. In order to quantify soil losses by tillage erosion, a tillage experiment was set up and an on-farm survey was conducted. Soil fluxes due to manual tillage on five slopes (32 - 82 %) were measured by monitoring tracers, by measuring tillage step characteristics and by collecting soil material in a trench. The <b>trench</b> <b>method</b> yielded soil flux values that were significantly smaller than those obtained by the tracer or the step method. Soil fluxes resulting from one manual tillage pass ranged between 39 and 87 kg/m on the tested slopes. On slopes up to 60 %, {{there were no significant differences}} in soil fluxes. However, on slopes steeper than 70 %, soil fluxes increased significantly because the angle of repose for soil clods was exceeded. The soil fluxes are used to construct a nomogram for estimating soil loss rates resulting from manual tillage erosion as a function of slope and plot length. Rates on a typical upland field (slope 30 %- 50 %, slope length 30 - 50 m) range from 8 to 18 t/ha. tillage pass, so tilage erosion is a significant contributor to the total soil loss. It dominates on short fields and fields with buffer-strips, whereas water erosion is the more important form of soil loss on middle size and long fields. Increasing land pressure will result in increasing tillage erosion rates, and these need to be considered when assessing soil degradation rates or when studying hillslope evolution.

We will prove a key invertibility result for these Sine matrices that covers all of the matrices, thereby definitively answering the open question of invertibility of the Sine matrices In for odd values of n. ^ In the second part of the dissertation, we seek to solve the first order system of equations y′=fx,y;x∈R,y∈ Rn ya=y 0 where f is a known vector-valued function in Rn. To accomplish this, we apply Sinc methods to discretize the problem. This generates a Toeplitz system of equations to solve with the special Sine matrix I(1). In order to solve the system of equations given the unique properties of I(1) and matrices like it, we develop modified versions of three standard Toeplitz solvers that create a new class of hybrid routines set up to utilize the beautiful matrix/vector duality of the Toeplitz systems that these matrices produce. ^ The three categories of Toeplitz systems of equations that we address in this dissertation can be categorized as follows.

40|$|Published online: 17 June 2009. Data on the {{distribution}} of root biomass are critical to understanding the ecophysiology of vegetation communities. This is particularly true when models are applied to describe ecohydrology and vegetation function. However, there is a paucity of such information across continental Australia. We quantified vertical and horizontal root biomass distribution in a woodland dominated by Angophora bakeri and Eucalyptus sclerophylla on the Cumberland Plains near Richmond, New South Wales. The site was characterised by a duplex (texture contrast) soil with the A horizon (to 70 cm) consisting of loamy sand and the B horizon (to < 10 m) consisting of sandy clay. The topsoil had a smaller bulk density, a smaller water holding capacity but a larger organic component and a larger hydraulic conductivity in comparison to the subsoil. Root biomass was sampled to 1. 5 m depth and declined through the soil profile. Whilst total biomass in the B horizon was relatively small, its contribution to the function of the trees was highly significant. Coarse roots accounted for approximately 82 % of the root mass recovered. Lateral distribution of fine roots was generally even but coarse roots were more likely to occur closer to tree stems. Variation in tree diameter explained 75 % of the variation in total below-ground biomass. The <b>trench</b> <b>method</b> suggested the belowground biomass was 6. 03 ± 1. 21 kg m⁻² but this method created bias towards sampling close to tree stems. We found that approximately 68 % of root material was within a 2 m radius of tree stems and this made up 54 % {{of the total number of}} samples but in reality, only approximately 5 to 10 % of the site is within a 2 m radius of tree stems. Based on these proportions, our recalculated belowground biomass was 2. 93 ± 0. 59 kg m⁻².

We found that soil CO 2 effluxes were strongly affected by the seasonal variation of soil temperature but weakly correlated with soil moisture, probably because the volumetric soil moisture (30 – 40 % at 95 % confidence interval) was within a plateau region for root and microbial activities. The soil CO 2 effluxes changed seasonally in parallel with soil temperature in topsoil with the peak in late summer. On the other hand, the contribution of R r to R s was the largest at about 50 % in early summer, when canopy photosynthesis and plant growth were more active. The temperature sensitivity (Q 10) of R r peaked in June. Under snowpack, R s was stable until mid-March and then gradually increased with snow melting. R s summed up to 79 gC m − 2 during the snowy season for 4 months. The annual R s was determined at 934 gC m − 2 y − 1 in 2003, which accounted for 63 % of ecosystem respiration.

The ratio of root system to {{the upper part of}} tree in these shrub species was larger than that in six tree species, and the root density of each shrub species was as low as C. japonica, which had the lowest root density among the six tree species, previously examined. The numeral ratios of fine root/big root of C. pauciflora and H. macrophylla were as low as P. edulis and M. liliflora. Contrary, the ratio of S. cantoniensis was intermediate like C. japonica, V. awabuki, and R. pseudoacacia. Then, the average diameter of big root of each shrub species tended to be smaller than that of the tree species. However, C. japonica had exceptionaly thin roots and P. edulis and M. liliflora had bigger roots. The trees with big root and few fine roots such as P. edulis and M. liliflora are usually unsuccessful to transplant. Therefore, both the average diameter of big root and the numeral ratio of fine/big root could be indices to evaluate the difficulty of transplanting. The vertical and the horizontal distribution patterns of roots are classified into three types, respectively, i. e. the congested, the dispersed, and the intermediate type between the two. The vertically congested and the vertically dispersed types are usually called the shallow and the deep root systems, respectively.

40|$|We {{calculated}} the total {{energy of a}} semiconductor quantum dot which {{is defined by the}} <b>trench</b> gate <b>method.</b> In our calculation we used a recently developed energy functional called ``orbital-free energy functional". We compared the total energies obtained by Thomas-Fermi approximation, orbital-free energy functional and standard local-density approximation for the square quantum slab geometry. We have seen that this newly developed energy functional is numerically very efficient, superior to the Thomas-Fermi approximation and is in good agreement with the local-density approximation for two different sizes of quantum dot systems.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{relationship}} between land use and soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh) in a Mediterranean agroecosystem under different long term managements: tilled vineyard, grass covered vineyard, rotation of haycrop-pasture with scattered trees of cork oak. Within management we distinguished between microenvironments under or out tree soil canopy influence. Autotrophic respiration was excluded by <b>trenching</b> <b>method.</b> Rh, soil temperature (T) and soil water content (SWC) were measured at the same time, within an year with a frequency between once a week and once a month depending on weather variability, from 9 : 00 to 14 : 00 (solar time). Rh was measured with a portable and closed chamber connected to an IRGA. There was a strong seasonal variation in Rh with maximums in spring and autumn. Rh values were averaging higher in haycrop and pasture and lower in the tilled vineyard than in the grass covered vineyard. Moreover, in the pasture and haycrop, the dynamics were affected by positions with respect to woody plant canopy soil vertical projections. In fact, in spring, higher values were observed out tree canopy than under, while in autumn the opposite trend was observed. Rh seasonal variation was correlated to SWC and soil T, except at the maximums. Spatial variation in Rh was found to be correlated to soil organic matter content...|$|R

It is observed that elastic modulus and hardness were found be less for indium wires than indium continuous films. It is found from the creep studies {{that in the}} case of nanowires, onset of dislocation creep phenomena occurs at very low loads. Hardness and modulus of indium micro/nanowires decrease with the decrease in wire diameter. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the mechanical {{properties of}} indium nanowires fabricated by <b>trench</b> template <b>method</b> and using nanoindentation technique.|$|R

40|$|International audienceTunnel excavations, {{underground}} {{mines and}} the collapse of abandoned shallow natural cavities induce a surface subsidence. The existing structures and infrastructures can be damaged by the strain and settlement of the soil in the subsided zone. Different strategies can be used to deal with the subsidence hazard before, during and after the subsidence occurrence. Some mitigation methods exist for reducing the impact of the subsidence on the existing structures. One of them is the periphery <b>trench.</b> The <b>method</b> consists in cutting the soil around the existing building then filling the trench with a compressible material. The effect of horizontal strain will be absorbed by the partial closure of the <b>trench.</b> Numerical <b>methods</b> (2 D and 3 D, finite element method and distinct element methods) are used to evaluate the optimal dimensions and the position of the periphery trench according to the magnitude of subsidence, the relative position of the settlement trough and the structure {{and the nature of the}} structure itself (mainly the position of the foundation). In addition, the numerical methods are used to determine the characteristics of the filling materials that can be recommended. A numerical parametric study has been carried out focussing mainly on the Young modulus of filling material. The numerical modelling results show clearly that the trench is efficient when the building is located on the compression zone of the subsidence. Moreover the distance between the trench and the foundation should be greater than one meter. The filling material must have a Young modulus ranging from 1 to 10 % of the Young modulus of soil...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to improve}} our {{understanding}} of temporal variations and controlling factors of soil respiration (R-s) and its components (microbial respiration or R-m and root respiration or R-b) in an Asian tropical seasonal forest at diurnal, seasonal and annual timescales in relation to biotic and abiotic controls. R-s was studied by the <b>trenching</b> <b>method</b> in a seasonal dry diptercarp forest, western Thailand. An automated soil chamber system was used to produce hourly data of R-s during 2008 - 2011. Analysis of R-s in relation to both biotic and abiotic factors was carried out to understand its temporal variations at different timescales. R-m was the main contributor to overall magnitude and variability of R-s. Soil temperature alone was the main driver of diurnal variation, while the combination of soil moisture and soil temperature determined the seasonal variations. The amount of R-s was also related to the fine root (< 2 mm) and microbial biomass at seasonal timescales. Due to the small inter-annual variations in soil temperature and moisture, total soil respiration among the 4 years was not significantly different (p < 0. 05). The annual totals for R-s during 2008 - 2011 were 3. 20, 3. 89, 3. 52, 4. 14 kgCO(2) m(- 2) years(- 1), respectively. The 4 -year average ratio of R-m (trenched) to R-s (untrenched) was 66 +/- 4 %. R-m {{plays a crucial role}} in determining the magnitude (large ratio between R-m and R-s) and temporal variations of R-s. In this forest ecosystem, high seasonal variations in R-s were observed and were mainly attributed to the response of R-m to moisture...|$|R
40|$|In 1979, {{a portion}} of the {{research}} farm was pattern tiled including the large tillage plots. This was used as an opportunity to compare tile installation methods: a conventional trenching machine (used widely prior to late 70 s), and a trenchless “tile plow” machine. The tile plow inserted plastic tile using a mole approach, which is the current primary tiling method. This research showed that plow and <b>trenching</b> tiling <b>methods</b> were not significantly different and both provided adequate drainage. It also showed that water table measurements were influenced more by timing of water needs of the crop being grown and intensity of the rainfall event than tiling method.

40|$|The {{selection}} of tree species {{is critical for}} soil organic carbon (SOC) stock and dynamics under afforestation. Exotic tree species were widely introduced and have been considered {{as a form of}} human-induced global change. However, how exotic tree species, as compared with native ones, affect SOC storage and soil respiration (R-s) has not been sufficiently investigated. Here we studied this issue in an even-aged (22 years) plantation composed by native Masson pine (Pious massoniana Lamb.) (MP) and exotic slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) (SP) in subtropical China. A <b>trenching</b> <b>method</b> was used to partition R-s into heterotrophic (R-h) and autotrophic respiration (R-a). R-s and R-h were measured approximately biweeldy during August 2007 to December 2009. Our results showed that seasonal patterns of R-s and R-h in both pine forests were mainly affected by soil temperature and moisture (R- 2 = 0. 56 - 0. 78, P< 0. 001). There was no difference in SOC stock (forest floor + mineral soil of 0 - 40 cm), R-h and turnover rate (R-h/SOC stock) between MP and SP forests. However, annual R-s, R-a and R-a/R-s, of MP were significantly 24 %, 119 % and 74 % higher than those of SP, respectively. In contrast, even though MP and SP had similar fine and coarse root biomass, MP had significant higher ratios of R-a/fine root biomass and R-a/coarse root biomass than SP, suggesting a higher respiration rate in native pine species on a root biomass basis. We concluded that the exotic SP, as compared with indigenous MP, did not alter SOC stock, R-h and turnover rate but depressed R-a and R-s. Therefore, both pine species were recommended in case of reforestation in terms of SOC sequestration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
