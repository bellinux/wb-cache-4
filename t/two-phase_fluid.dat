The <b>two-phase</b> <b>fluid</b> reservoir is a critical component in the <b>two-phase</b> <b>fluid</b> bus. It both controls the saturation temperature and provides a space for volumetric changes. A dynamic reservoir simulation model does not currently exist, but it is needed to expedite efforts and reduce risk. During 1989 an {{effort was made to}} develop a simulation model of the transient performance of a <b>two-phase</b> <b>fluid</b> reservoir. As a beginning, a preliminary model was developed. It is based upon component mathematical models in lumped parametric form and build upon five component mathematical models for calculating dynamic responses of <b>two-phase</b> <b>fluid</b> reservoirs, primary feedback elements, controller commands, heater actuators, and reservoir heaters. As much as possible, the model took advantage of the available SINDA' 85 /FLUINT thermal/fluid integrator. Additional calculation logic and computer subroutines were developed to complete implementation of the model. The model is capable of simulating dynamic response of an equilibrium <b>two-phase</b> <b>fluid</b> reservoir. Modification of the model to include the liquid/vapor nonequilibrium is required for applications of the model to simulate performance of reservoir in which the liquid and vapor phases of the reservoir fluid are not in equilibrium. In addition, the model in its present form, needs to be refined in several respects. More empirical data are needed to guide the model development. The model may then be used to conduct a full parametric study of <b>two-phase</b> <b>fluid</b> reservoirs. More complexities in two-phaes flow regions in laboratory and flight conditions may have to be considered eventually if empirical data cannot be simulated satisfactorily. System with other components arrangement also need to be simulated if optimization is ever to be attained.

A capillarity-driven gas-liquid motion in rectangular channel is simulated by use of a PFM method for solving Navier-Stokes (NS) equations and a CH equation, whereas an immiscible liquid-liquid flow in a microchannel with T-junction and square cross section is simulated by use of another PFM method proposed in this study, which adopts a lattice-Boltzmann method based on fictitious particles kinematics as numerical scheme for solving NS equations and an AC equation that is modified to improve volume-of-fluid conservation. The major findings are as follows: (1) effect of capillary force on the dynamic <b>two-phase</b> <b>fluid</b> system with a high density ratio is well predicted for cross-sectional aspect ratio of the channel = 1 and 2; (2) mono-dispersed slug flow pattern transition is reproduced in good agreement with experimental observations in terms of variation in length and interval of droplets as increasing their volumetric flow rates at a constant flow rate ratio = 1.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present a}} {{simulation}} method for relative permeability using the two-phase Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) method. Our implementation honors physical two-phase flow phenomena, such as Laplace’s law and contact angles. The successful replication of a drainage-type snap-off indicates that our method properly describes capillary pressure. We applied our method to realistic pore geometry, a digital Fontainebleau sandstone sample from synchrotron X-ray microtomography technique. Both steady state and unsteady state simulations were performed, {{and we could}} successfully obtain relative permeability and effective flux {{as a function of}} time and location. We observed the nonlinearity between pressure gradient and effective flux through the steady-state simulation. This nonlinearity is easily predictable, since <b>two-phase</b> <b>fluid</b> flow is mainly controlled by capillary pressure, which is not linearly related to the pressure gradient. The unsteady-state simulations showed very realistic replacement of one phase by the other, for drainage as well as imbibition. After verifying that the two-phase LBM can simulate <b>two-phase</b> <b>fluid</b> flow through porous media, we investigated the effect of initial distribution of two fluids- the change in sweep efficiency due to different initial distributions. When the non-wetting phase is discontinuous and isolated in the pore space (patchy saturation), the imbibition efficiency is poor and the residual oil saturation is high. From simulation results, we found that two-phase Lattice-Boltzmann implementation can simulate realistic <b>two-phase</b> <b>fluid</b> flow in complex pore geometries, which could complement or replace difficult and time-consuming laboratory measurements. In addition, it can help us to understand the underlying pore-scale physics and determine appropriate macroscopic relations in two-phase systems. Lastly, the two-phase simulator can be a module for more complex applications, such as capillary pressure curve simulation, relative permeability estimation from thin sections and diagenesis modeling with <b>two-phase</b> <b>fluid</b> flow...|$|E

We show that incorporating a correction term can improve the Galilean invariance of the method by up to an order of magnitude. Surprisingly incorporating this correction term can also noticeably increase the range of stability for multi-phase algorithms. We found that this is true for methods in which the non-ideality is incorporated by a forcing term as well as methods in which non-ideality is directly incorporated in a non-ideal pressure tensor.

Early theoretical and empirical studies {{date back to the}} ‘ 80 s, but currently no device is commercially available. This technology has a significant feature respect to the traditional circulation pumps and vapor compressors: in fact a <b>two-phase</b> <b>fluid</b> compressor is able to work with chemical species in the wet vapor phase (consisting of two phases liquid and vapor) in order to increase simultaneously their pressure employing the mechanical energy provided by a motor.

We show that the behavior of F_ϵ in the limit ϵ→ 0 and λ→∞ depends on the limit of ϵλ. If this limit is finite and strictly positive, then the singular limit of the energies F_ϵ lead to a coupled problem of bulk and surface phase transitions, and under certain assumptions agrees with the relaxation of the capillary energy with line tension...|$|R
