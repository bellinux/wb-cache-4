However, questions surround whether small <b>time</b> <b>savings</b> are as valuable per unit as larger savings.

40|$|Values {{of travel}} <b>time</b> <b>savings</b> {{are often used}} in {{cost-benefit}} analysis of transport projects and policies, and also to compute generalised travel costs. There has been considerable debate as to whether different research methods (e. g. stated versus revealed preference) will lead to different values of travel <b>time</b> <b>savings,</b> and which segmentations (e. g. by income or mode) are most important to capture the heterogeneity in these values. In addition there are many countries where no specific valuation studies have been done.

25|$|This {{new concept}} in lock design {{has yet to}} be {{installed}} on any waterway. It is basically a shaft lock with a diagonal shaft. The proposal is for a long tube of reinforced concrete, of a size to accommodate the boats being lifted, to be built on the slope between the upper and lower levels. The bottom of the tube is sealed with a strong watertight door, but there is a single pair of conventional lock gates at the top, installed a boat's length from the far wall of the tube. The change in level is achieved by filling the tube with water from the top pound, or by draining. The vessel floats {{on the surface of the}} water, with a guide float or pontoon, shaped to fit the tube, floating alongside to keep it clear of the walls. Side ponds, piped from the main tube, are incorporated to save water. In replacing a traditional flight or staircase of locks, a considerable <b>time</b> <b>saving</b> is anticipated. It differs from the similar caisson lock design in that the boat does not have to be carried in a submerged chamber.|$|E

40|$|Tax {{preparation}} firms advertise {{their services}} {{as a way to}} save taxes. To investigate this subject, we use a panel of German income tax accounting data, consisting of employees and other taxpayers with non-business income, to explore the relationship between expenses for tax preparation and tax liabilities. We find a negative link with expenses exceeding estimated tax savings. Specifically, one additional Euro yields an estimated tax savings of 72 cents in an OLS regression and 24 cents in a fixed-effects regression. This finding indicates that cross-section estimates are upward biased. The magnitude of the effect implies that tax preparation expenses are not worthwhile from a tax saving perspective alone. In consideration of <b>time</b> <b>savings,</b> combined tax and <b>time</b> <b>savings</b> also do not exceed expenses for any income quintile. The result is robust to various alternative specifications such that in no setting do the pecuniary and <b>time</b> <b>savings</b> exceed the tax preparation expenses.

2500|$|The {{individual}} {{opportunity of}} cost is an often overlooked {{cause of the}} rebound effect. Just as improved workplace tools result in an increased expectation of productivity, so does the increased availability of time result {{in an increase in}} demand for a service. Research articles often examine increasingly convenient and more rapid modes of transportation to determine the rebound effect in energy demand. Because time cost forms {{a major part of the}} total cost of commuter transport, rapid modes will reduce real costs, but will also encourage longer commuting distances which will in turn increase energy consumption. While important, it is almost impossible to estimate empirically the scale of such effects due to the subjective nature of the value of time. Time saved can either be used towards additional work or leisure which may have differing degrees of rebound effect. [...] Labor time saved at work due to the increased labour productivity is likely to be spent on further labor time at higher productive rates. [...] For leisure <b>time</b> <b>saving,</b> this may simply encourage people to diversify their leisure interests to fill their generally fixed period of leisure time.|$|E
