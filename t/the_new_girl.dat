500|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} pair of jealous {{strippers}} applying lipstick and caddying back-and-forth between backstage, in a South of the Border strip zoo named [...] "La Jungla". Meanwhile, Mars' [...] "Money Make Her Smile" [...] can be heard from the room, the two of them are talking about a new girl who has been [...] "fooling around" [...] with someone else's man (Mr. Mars). The scene ends with one of the two women saying, [...] "Wait 'til I tell the boss what she's sleeping with". It is shown that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>girl,</b> Isabella, has been listening to the conversation and it's her time to dance as soon as the boss says so. The role of Isabella is portrayed by Indian actress Freida Pinto, who after an introduction by Guzmán, the zoo owner, starts to pull off [...] "gravity-defying spins on the pole" [...] as Mars and his mates, who serve as the house band, perform the song. On the following scene, Isabella sheds her clothes with such rage that sparks fall from the ceiling while Mars stares at her intensely singing [...] "You and me baby making love like gorillas". As the second verse starts, intermittent shots of Mars and Isabella [...] "heating up the backseat of a car" [...] along with shots of her [...] "grinding on customers" [...] and banging on Mars' chest as he sings the line [...] "Bang Bang, Gorilla". The former shots are shown throughout the video. As the video continues, Isabella is shown [...] "to drop on her knees and lick" [...] Mars' guitar. She grabs it and pours tequila over the same, before using a lighter to set it on fire. Afterwards, the roof sprinklers come on and Isabella lets the water shower her while she stands on her underwear. The video ends in a chase scene in which Mars runs down through a dimly lit aisle, and suddenly transforms into a giant gorilla, while Isabella is seen {{at the end of the}} pathway waiting for him. The video doesn't contain any of the teasers Mars released days before the video, including the iguana shot, the outer car scene and the one with Luis Guzman listening to the intro for Isabella.|$|E

Several thousand applicants attended auditions across the UK in hope of being selected. Ten girls and ten boys were chosen as finalists by judges Pete Waterman, Louis Walsh and Geri Halliwell. Walsh did not initially {{make it into the}} group of ten female contestants who were to appear on the show. However, when another contestant was disqualified on a technicality, she found herself on the show. These finalists then took to the stage participating in weekly Saturday night live performances which alternated weekly between the girls and boys.

2500|$|Screenwriters Stephanie Counts and Shari Gold {{filed an}} 87-page lawsuit in January 2014, {{claiming}} that New Girl {{was based on}} their 2006 script for a proposed television series. There {{were a number of}} similarities, including the number of roommates, similar backgrounds, appearance, and ethnicity. [...] Additionally, Jess's long term partner in <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Girl</b> pilot had the same name (Spencer) and they broke up for similar reasons (partner's infidelity). [...] Fox and talent agency William Morris Endeavor Entertainment LLC responded in April 2014 that in their view, the two works were not substantially similar and that any other similarities stemmed from non-protectable ideas, or scenes a faire. Thus, they pleaded that the judge dismiss the case. [...] The case was dismissed with leave to amend in 2014. [...] An amended complaint was filed in 2014 and decided by summary judgment against Counts and Gold on December 30, 2015. [...] In March, Counts and Gold were ordered to pay approximately $800,000 in attorney's fees.|$|E

2500|$|With Kasdan's {{advice to}} cast good actors and write for them instead of shoehorning {{them into the}} other roles, Meriwether was {{prepared}} to deviate from her pitched characters during casting. Basing Nick Miller on a friend also surnamed Miller, she originally imagined Nick as the smartest {{one of the group}} who doesn't need to say that and thought of him as [...] "the everyman one, who's stepping away and commenting on what all the crazy people are doing around him." [...] She sent <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Girl</b> pilot script to movie actor Jake Johnson, with whom she had enjoyed working on No Strings Attached. As he had never auditioned for a TV pilot, she guided him through the audition process. Casting was done mainly through chemistry tests, and Johnson auditioned with Max Greenfield, who impressed the producers in his first audition as Schmidt. The actors auditioning for Schmidt were more varied in appearance than those auditioning for Nick, and Johnson and Greenfield were initially worried that they looked too much alike. Johnson got the role of Nick after he agreed to lose 15 pounds at the network's request; Greenfield learned the same day that he was cast.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Girl</b> {{production}} {{offices are}} on the Fox lot in Los Angeles, next to those of Homeland. New Girl had 11 writers during its first season and 15 during the second season, half of them male. Stories are developed in a collaborative effort and are aimed at viewers of all genders. The first season had no planned story arcs, but focused on setting up the characters, while the second season was to show different sides of the characters. Overarching storylines usually culminate at a season's end; the actors are generally not told the ending. Meriwether said the writers did not [...] "have a lot of plans. I think we really just {{to try to go}} where the show wants to go." [...] The writers challenge themselves to create new stories and to change the show's dynamics to keep things fresh, while aiming to be [...] "as emotionally real as possible" [...] with [...] "Every story having to feel like it was grounded in some emotional arc as opposed to going from the joke into the story." [...] As the show's jokes rely on the actors' performance instead of perfectly constructed punch lines, Meriwether looks for the actors' strengths before writing. The A story generally revolves around Jess and has an emotional core. Still, Meriwether sees the show as an ensemble about friendship with [...] "everybody having their own stories and people being interested in all of the characters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Movie {{actress and}} singer-songwriter Zooey Deschanel {{was in the}} process of {{developing}} an HBO show when she read <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Girl</b> pilot script and responded to the material. The character of Jess was not specifically written for Deschanel, but the producers found it a great match and did not need a lot of fine-tuning. With the support from Fox, Meriwether wanted to make Jess a unique, interesting and funny female character that would have been the side character on other shows. Deschanel became a producer on the show and helped build the character, requesting to not play the classic wife character who would be ignored by the guys she tries to keep out of trouble. Meriwether's goal was to write about herself from an honest perspective, with Jess mirroring her at the start and later Deschanel until Jess turned into a [...] "hybrid of me and Zooey, the writers, and the editor". Deschanel described Jess as a part of her, especially in regards to [...] "the sort of enthusiasm and optimism" [...] of her youth. She does not shy away from playing embarrassing scenes or being unattractive, and Kasdan said that [...] "This show advocates for the attractive dork." [...] Although Meriwether had always imagined the show as an ensemble show, Fox would later focus its first marketing push on Zooey Deschanel and gave the show the promotional tagline [...] "Simply Adorkable." ...|$|E

Hudgens starred alongside Zac Efron and Ashley Tisdale in the film, the former of which she was partnered up with during the auditioning process due to their [...] "chemistry". The film, released on January 20, 2006, was both a critical and commercial success. High School Musical was Disney Channel's most watched film that year with 7.7million viewers in its premiere broadcast in the US, until August's premiere of The Cheetah Girls 2, which achieved 8.1 million viewers. In the UK, it received 789,000 viewers for its premiere (and 1.2 million viewers overall during the first week), making it the second most watched program for the Disney Channel (UK) of 2006. On December 29, 2006, it became the first Disney Channel Original Movie to be broadcast on the BBC. For the film, Hudgens recorded numerous songs which had commercial success. The song [...] "Breaking Free", a duet with Zac Efron, went on to become Hudgens' only Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 to date, when it peaked at number 4 on the chart.

As of August 2009, the album has sold 570,000 copies in the U.S. It was preceded by two singles, [...] "Come Back to Me" [...] and [...] "Say OK", both of which were slightly successful in numerous countries. Both singles received heavy promotion on Disney Channel, with the music videos for both premiering on the channel.|$|E
