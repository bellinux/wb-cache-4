5|$|Lionhead Studios used Michael Bratman's belief–desire–intention {{model to}} {{simulate}} creatures' learning {{and decision making}} processes. A creature forms an intention by combining desires, opinions, and beliefs. Beliefs are attributed to lists that store data about various world objects. Desires are goals the creature wants to fulfill, expressed as simplified perceptrons. Opinions describe ways of satisfying a desire using decision <b>trees.</b> <b>For</b> each desire, the creature selects the belief with the best opinion, thus forming an intention or goal.|$|E

The program allows {{citizens}} to receive trees from four to seven feet tall. They also give them fertilizer, and delivery, all at no cost. They encourage citizens to plant their trees to benefit their home by reducing air conditioning costs. Approximately more than 450,000 shade trees have been planted in the Sacramento area.|$|E

Now following a steady northeastern alignment, the highway continues through the large patches of trees south of Haneyville. At Little Plum Run Road, the highway turns onto a steady northward alignment.

5|$|The striped honeyeater breeds {{throughout}} its distribution range, usually as simple pairs, with both sexes building the nest, incubating and feeding the young. However cooperative breeding has been observed, {{with a third}} adult bird involved in feeding nestlings. It nests solitarily, and pairs use the same or adjoining <b>trees</b> <b>for</b> nesting over two or more seasons.|$|E
5|$|Although fishers are {{competent}} tree climbers, {{they spend}} most of their time on the forest floor and prefer continuous forest to other habitats. Fishers have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of the boreal forest but are also common in mixed hardwood and conifer forests. Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and will avoid areas with less than 50% coverage. Fishers are more likely to be found in old-growth forests. Since female fishers require moderately large <b>trees</b> <b>for</b> denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appears to be unsuitable for their needs.|$|E

5|$|Improved {{reliability}} for on-disk structures: ReFS uses B+ <b>trees</b> <b>for</b> all on-disk structures including metadata and file data. Metadata and file data are organized into tables {{similar to a}} relational database. The file size, number of files in a folder, total volume size and number of folders in a volume are limited by 64-bit numbers; as a result ReFS supports a maximum file size of 16 exabytes, a maximum of 18.4 × 1018 folders and a maximum volume size of 1 yottabyte (with 64 KB clusters) which allows large scalability with no practical limits on file and folder size (hardware restrictions still apply). Free space is counted by a hierarchical allocator which includes three separate tables for large, medium, and small chunks. File names and file paths are each limited to a 32 KB Unicode text string.|$|E
5|$|Mushrooms with an {{appearance}} similar to S.lakei {{can often be}} distinguished by their associations with <b>trees.</b> <b>For</b> example, the eastern North American species S.spraguei grows in association with Eastern White Pine. The cap of S.spraguei has red fibrils on a yellow background. S.cavipes and S.ochraceoroseus always grow with Larch. S.ponderosus, which grows in mixed coniferous forests, has a gelatinous veil. Smith and Thiers note {{that it is difficult}} to tell the difference between the two if S.ponderosus has lost its veil, since the colors of the species intergrade and cannot reliably be used to distinguish them. S.decipiens has a cap that is orangish to pink-orange with hairs or scales. S.caerulescens is a similar species in western North America; it can be distinguished by the strong blue staining that develops when the stem is injured.|$|E
5|$|Numerous fady protect {{wilderness}} areas, particularly {{including the}} Ankarana massif. Excessive cutting of mangrove <b>trees</b> <b>for</b> wood or {{the setting of}} bush fires are both prohibited, as {{is the use of}} nets with holes less than 15 millimeters to prevent catching immature fish. Certain species are protected through fady that forbid hunting them, including sharks, rays and crocodiles. Many fady also exist to regulate relations between the sexes. For instance, it is taboo for a girl to wash her own brother's clothing. Conservative communities adhere to a fady against medical injections, surgery or modern medicines due to their association with their historic enemies the Merina, who were the first to use them widely; instead, tromba ceremonies and traditional herbal remedies are commonly used for healing. These taboos are most strongly applied in the center of Antankarana territory around the village of Ambatoharaña and less so in the villages at the periphery of the region.|$|E

5|$|On Thursday, December 12, 1799, Washington {{spent several}} hours {{inspecting}} his plantation on horseback, in snow, hail, and freezing rain; that evening, he ate his supper without changing from his wet clothes. He awoke {{the next morning}} with a severe sore throat and became increasingly hoarse as the day progressed, yet still rode out in the heavy snow, marking <b>trees</b> <b>for</b> cutting on the plantation. Some time around 3a.m. that Saturday, he suddenly awoke with severe difficulty breathing and almost completely unable to speak or swallow. He was {{a firm believer in}} bloodletting, which was a standard medical practice of that era, and he had used it to treat various ailments of slaves on his plantation. He ordered estate overseer Albin Rawlins to remove nearly a pint of his blood.|$|E
5|$|Resident from India and Sri Lanka through Southeast Asia to Australia on coasts {{and major}} waterways, the white-bellied sea eagle breeds and hunts near water, and fish form around {{half of its}} diet. Opportunistic, it consumes carrion and {{a wide variety of}} animals. Although rated of Least Concern globally, it has {{declined}} in parts of southeast Asia such as Thailand, and southeastern Australia. It is ranked as Threatened in Victoria and Vulnerable in South Australia and Tasmania. Human disturbance to its habitat is the main threat, both from direct human activity near nests which impacts on breeding success, and from removal of suitable <b>trees</b> <b>for</b> nesting. The white-bellied sea eagle is revered by indigenous people in many parts of Australia, and is the subject of various folk tales throughout its range.|$|E
