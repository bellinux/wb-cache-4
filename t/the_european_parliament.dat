5|$|Croatia {{first elected}} 12 members of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Parliament</b> (MEPs) in a {{by-election}} held after its accession to the EU in 2013. Thereafter, its {{number of members}} in <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Parliament</b> was reduced to 11 and the country elected {{them as part of}} the regular election in 2014. The elections are regulated by special legislation enacted by the Sabor. Provisions of the legislation are very similar to the parliamentary-election legislation, with the main difference being that the 11 members of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Parliament</b> are elected in a single constituency encompassing all of Croatia, instead of multiple constituencies used in the parliamentary elections.|$|E
