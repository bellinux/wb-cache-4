5|$|Deep Impact {{observed}} Comet Garradd (C/2009 P1) from February 20 to April 8, 2012, {{using its}} Medium Resolution Instrument, {{through a variety}} of filters. The comet was 1.75–2.11 astronomical units (AU) (2.62–3.16×108 km) from the Sun and 1.87–1.30 AU from the spacecraft. It was found that the outgassing from the comet varies with a period of 10.4 hours, which is presumed to be due to the rotation of its nucleus. The dry ice content of the comet was measured and found to be about <b>ten</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> its water ice content by number of molecules.|$|E
5|$|Follow-ups of {{untreated}} {{people over}} thirty {{with a history}} of severe allergic reactions would greatly benefit from venom immunotherapy. Both rapid and slow doses can be done safely during immunotherapy. The efficacy (capacity to induce a therapeutic effect) of ant venom immunotherapy is effective in reducing systemic reactions in comparison to placebo and whole body extract immunotherapy, where patients were more likely to suffer from a systemic reaction. Ultrarush initiation of insect immunotherapy may be used, but results show higher risks of allergic reactions. Despite immunotherapy being successful, only <b>ten</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> patients do not have any response to desensitisation.|$|E

During its existence the campaign had utilized an average of only <b>ten</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the Air Force's tactical air effort in Southeast Asia.

After Liz fires Floyd's girlfriend, she goes on a rampage around 30 Rock firing people, including her producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), who disagrees with her decision to fire Floyd's girlfriend for her own personal gain. Jack later tells her that he hired all the fired people back, but he is transferring Floyd's girlfriend to General Electric headquarters in Fairfield, Connecticut.|$|E

Most of the time we lived in Jaffa. Our house had about twenty rooms, and we children would go down to swim in the sea. We also had stables with Arabian horses, and one of our homes in Ashkelon even had a large swimming pool. I think we must have been the only family in Palestine with a private swimming pool.|$|E
5|$|Paul finally became sheriff in April 1881, {{but it was}} {{too late}} to reappoint Wyatt Earp as deputy sheriff because on January 1, 1881, the eastern portion of Pima County {{containing}} Tombstone had been split off into the new Cochise County, which would need its own sheriff, based in the county's largest city, Tombstone. This position was filled by a political appointment from the governor, and Wyatt and Behan both wanted the job. The Cochise County sheriff's position was worth more than $40,000 a year (about $ today) because the office holder was also county assessor and tax collector, and the board of supervisors allowed him to keep <b>ten</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the amounts paid.|$|E
5|$|Reports of {{this first}} contact between {{opposing}} forces outside St. Jean were often wildly exaggerated, with many local reports claiming it {{as some kind of}} victory.

Following this news, General Carleton issued orders for all of the nearby parishes to call up <b>ten</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> their militia.
