5|$|He {{explains}} that the assassin was not hired to kill Warren St. Claire, but to kill the bodyguard instead. When Vasquez had discovered that Lloyd was embezzling campaign funds, he approached the bodyguard about murdering Vasquez. As the bodyguard refused {{to carry out the}} murder, Lloyd had him killed. To prove his theory, Monk shows a photograph of Lloyd looking at the direction of the shooter just after <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> were fired. Monk proves that Lloyd's sight line was obstructed, and that the gunshot's echo would have masked the direction of the shot. As such, it was impossible that Lloyd could have known where <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> were coming from unless he already knew where the gunman would be.|$|E

30|$|To {{make the}} {{thresholds}} sensitive to <b>the</b> different <b>shot</b> classes, {{we need some}} methods to make such thresholds locally adaptive. <b>The</b> overall video <b>shot</b> complexity depends on the activity and the motion, while <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> class depends on both the complexity and the duration of <b>the</b> <b>shot.</b> <b>The</b> <b>shot</b> duration has a strong correlation {{with the amount of}} motion in the video. The length of <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> is typically inversely proportional to the amount of motion in the video [9]. We can determine the temporal duration as we analyze <b>the</b> <b>shot.</b> We could also determine the motion complexity by computing the motion vectors using motion estimation techniques [36]. However, motion estimation is very computationally intensive.|$|R
50|$|The first sweep {{controlled}} the power; the {{closer to the}} right end of <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> bar, <b>the</b> more power <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> had. <b>The</b> second sweep {{controlled the}} accuracy; the closer to a center line near the left end, the more accurate <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> was.|$|R
5|$|Three {{mainstream}} narratives emerged {{after the}} shooting. The early view that Israeli gunfire {{had killed the}} boy developed into the position that, because of the trajectory of <b>the</b> <b>shots,</b> Palestinian gunfire {{was more likely to}} have been responsible. This view was expressed in 2005 by Denis Jeambar, editor-in-chief of L'Express, and , a former France2 correspondent, who viewed the raw footage. A third perspective, held by Arlette Chabot, France 2's news editor, is that no one can know who fired <b>the</b> <b>shots.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{opposed to}} film makers, virtual camera system creators {{have to deal}} with a world that is {{interactive}} and unpredictable. It is not possible to know where the player's character {{is going to be in}} the next few seconds; therefore, it is not possible to plan <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> as a film maker would do. To solve this issue, the system relies on certain rules or artificial intelligence to select the most appropriate shots.|$|E
5|$|Camera crews spent 10 {{days from}} November 5–18, 2005 to film {{sequences}} that would involve intense visual effects so Sony Pictures Imageworks could begin work on <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> {{early in the}} project. The same steps had been taken for Spider-Man 2 to begin producing visual effects early for sequences involving the villain Doctor Octopus.|$|E
50|$|To {{control the}} swing, the player uses a power gauge {{to select the}} {{strength}} and height of <b>the</b> <b>shot.</b> When <b>the</b> player first presses <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> button, a marker starts to upwards {{to the top of}} the gauge. If the player hits <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> button again before it reaches the top (this controls how hard <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> will be), <b>the</b> marker will then move back down towards the starting position. The player then must hit the button a third time inside of a green area on the power gauge (this controls how high <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> will go in the air). If the player fails to hit <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> button a third time, the sequence will start over from the beginning.|$|R

5|$|Each shot in {{an artistic}} billiards match is played from a {{well-defined}} position (in some venues within an exacting two millimeter tolerance), and each shot must unfold in an established manner.

5|$|His earlier {{insistence on}} not filming with live {{ammunition}} {{proved to be}} a good decision. Having been told while filming Angels with Dirty Faces that he would be doing a scene with real machine gun bullets (a common practice in the Hollywood of the time), Cagney refused and insisted <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> be added afterwards.

5|$|The big {{dance was}} the film's most {{sustained}} and elaborate sequence, so two cameras were used, with frequent recourse to hand-holding and telephoto zooming in order both {{to sustain the}} documentary-style look and feel and to take pressure off the performers, who were not always sure whether they were being included in <b>the</b> <b>shots.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{locations}} in the film are separated visually from <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> of Madonna, who is singing in a darkened studio. Unlike her previous videos, Madonna portrays a narrator, whose song comments on the story, appearing in shots completely different from the narrative action. She appears {{to speak for the}} character, addressing his problems directly, like the chorus of a classical tragedy.|$|E
5|$|Owens did {{not have}} time to {{complete}} <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> before <b>the</b> Cannes screenings, but afterwards he used cineSync to conduct most of the work from home. <b>The</b> <b>shot</b> includes two blocks of computer-generated buildings that recede into the distance of a downtown set extension. As Collins disappears into the crowd about a minute into <b>the</b> <b>shot,</b> <b>the</b> live footage is gradually joined with more digital work. The streetcars, tracks and power lines were all computer generated. Live-action extras appear for the first minute of <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> before being replaced by digital ones. <b>The</b> <b>shot</b> was made more complicated by the need to add Massive extras. Owens constructed the scene by first building the digital foreground around the live action footage. He then added the background before filling the scene with vehicles and people.|$|R

5|$|The silent {{film was}} shot in black and white; its intertitles were bilingual, written in both Malay and Chinese. The American film {{historian}} Richard Abel writes that the film's technical quality, like all other local productions of the time, was poor and unable to compete with imported works, and the Indonesian film scholar Misbach Yusa Biran writes that <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> were considered blurry even at the time.|$|E
5|$|According to Dallas, {{it rained}} on days that were {{supposed}} to be sunny, while other days of production lacked rain when {{they were supposed to be}} rainy. Goodwin added that the scene of Snow and Charming releasing the birds was freezing because of the heavy rain. Their scene in the cabin took place on the first day of the episode's production. Her near-death scene involved a real cliff, though the height was exaggerated later using CGI and a green screen; a stunt double stood in for some of <b>the</b> <b>shots.</b>|$|E
5|$|Agent Carter {{was filmed}} over five days, with Gabriel Beristain serving as cinematographer. The budget {{did not allow}} for a {{storyboard}} artist to be hired, so D'Esposito, Winderbaum, and Beristain worked together to plan a shot list for the production using stand-in actors. The stunts were also pre-filmed to show the actors. D'Esposito explained that having <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> planned helped with planning the visual effects for the film. The mid-credits scene with Neal McDonough as Dum Dum Dugan was planned to show the character in a pool, but had to be changed on set to taking place beside the pool when {{it was found that}} the muscle suit McDonough wears to portray the character could not get wet.|$|E
