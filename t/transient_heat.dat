25|$|Film {{capacitors}} for use {{in electronic}} equipment are packaged in the common and usual industry styles: axial, radial, and SMD. Traditional axial type packages are less used today, but are still specified for point-to-point wiring and some traditional through-hole printed circuit boards. The most common form factor is the radial type (single ended), with both terminals {{on one side of}} the capacitor body. To facilitate automated insertion, radial plastic film capacitors are commonly constructed with terminal spacings at standardized distances, starting with 2.5mm pitch and increasing in 2.5mm steps. Radial capacitors are available potted in plastic cases, or dipped in an epoxy resin to protect the capacitor body against environmental influences. Although the <b>transient</b> <b>heat</b> of reflow soldering induces high stress in the plastic film materials, film capacitors able to withstand such temperatures are available in Surface Mounted Device“ (SMD) packages.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} and discusses {{the results of}} the <b>transient</b> <b>heating</b> analysis of single core cables laid directly in the ground. In order to analyze <b>transient</b> <b>heating</b> of cables a daily load diagram with three levels, which can be described by two parameters is used. These parameters are duration of high level loading and load factor. In order to analyze daily temperature variation of the cable the ratio of high level current loading to rated current of the cable is also required. Parameters that affect results are varied in analysis: thermal conductivity and diffusivity of soil, the distance between adjacent cables, temperature of referent soil, cross-bonding of metal sheets, etc. The results of analysis are ranges of conductor temperature variation, i. e. daily minimum and maximum temperature of the conductor for different laying and ambient conditions. The presented results can be used in estimation of cable overloading capability as well as for estimation of aging of cables exposed to cyclic loading.

5000|$|Values of the Biot number {{smaller than}} 0.1 {{imply that the}} heat {{conduction}} inside the body is much faster than the heat convection away from its surface, and temperature gradients are negligible inside of it.

For example, a Biot number less than 0.1 typically indicates less than 5% error will be present when assuming a lumped-capacitance model of <b>transient</b> <b>heat</b> transfer (also called lumped system analysis). Typically this type of analysis leads to simple exponential heating or cooling behavior ("Newtonian" [...] cooling or heating) since the amount of thermal energy (loosely, amount of [...] "heat") in the body is directly proportional to its temperature, which in turn determines {{the rate of heat}} transfer into or out of it.
