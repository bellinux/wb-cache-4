40|$|Various {{studies have}} {{reported}} that moral intuitions about the permissibility of acts are subject <b>to</b> <b>framing</b> effects. This paper reports {{the results of a}} series of experiments which further examine the susceptibility of moral intuitions <b>to</b> <b>framing</b> effects. The main aim was to test recent speculation that intuitions about the moral relevance of certain properties of cases might be relatively resistent <b>to</b> <b>framing</b> effects. If correct, this would provide a certain type of moral intuitionist with the resources to resist challenges to the reliability of moral intuitions based on such framing effects. And, fortunately for such intuitionists, although the results can’t be used to mount a strident defence of intuitionism, the results do serve to shift the burden of proof onto those who would claim that intuitions about moral relevance are problematically sensitive <b>to</b> <b>framing</b> effects...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSurveys are {{sometimes}} viewed with suspicion when {{used to provide}} economic values, since they are sensitive <b>to</b> <b>framing</b> effects. However, {{the extent to which}} those effects may vary between individuals has received little attention. Are some individuals less sensitive <b>to</b> <b>framing</b> effects than others? We use the theory of social representation to assign to each individual a new variable to serve as a proxy for the individual's sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>framing</b> effects. This allows to gather new and relevant information to limit the impact of framing effects. We examine two framing effects, starting-point bias and illingness-to-pay and willingness-to-accept divergence...|$|R

Both of them become particularly suspicious when they disappear, and Hank is implied as the killer when Mindy's dead body washes onshore. However, Veronica later deduces that teaching assistant Tim Foyle (James Jordan) committed the murder <b>to</b> <b>frame</b> Hank.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} how {{the model of}} deliberation proposed by Isabela and Norman Fairclough {{can be used for}} a better clarification and understanding of the framing processes in media – especially in opinion articles. We thus aim at integrating theoretical contributions from critical discourse analysis and argumentation theory with standard approaches <b>to</b> <b>framing,</b> originating in media studies. We emphasize how a rhetorical approach <b>to</b> <b>framing</b> can provide analytical insights into framing processes and complement the typical quantitative approaches with qualitative analysis based on textual reconstruction. Starting from an issue-specific approach <b>to</b> <b>framing,</b> we discuss a particular case of framing of intra-EU migration, analyzing four opinion articles selected from a larger corpus of Romanian, British and French media. We highlight, along our analysis, various methodological options and analytical difficulties inherent to such an approach...|$|R

5|$|From 1722 to 1724, brief armed {{conflicts}} between the Natchez and French were settled through negotiations between Louisiana governor Bienville and Natchez war chief Tattooed Serpent. In 1723, Bienville had been informed that some Natchez had harassed villagers, and he razed the Natchez village of White Apple and enslaved several villagers, {{only to discover that}} the alleged harassment had been faked by the colonists <b>to</b> <b>frame</b> the Natchez. One of the later skirmishes in 1724 consisted of the murder of a Natchez chief's son by a colonist, to which the Natchez responded by killing another Frenchman named Guenot. Bienville then sent French soldiers from New Orleans to attack the Natchez at their fields and settlements, and the Natchez surrendered. Their plea for peace was met following the execution of one of their chiefs by the French.|$|E

5|$|In June 1940, the Government of Madras {{appointed}} a committee headed by Srinivasa Sastri <b>to</b> <b>frame</b> {{a set of}} general principles for coining words for scientific and technical terms in vernacular languages. The constitution of the committee was strongly condemned by the Madras Presidency Tamil Sangam and its Secretary E. M.

The committee submitted its report after three months recommending the retention of the existing Sanskrit loanwords in Tamil and rejecting the need {{for them to be}} replaced. The deliberations of the Sastri Committee provoked widespread agitations in Madras Presidency. The committee was eventually reshuffled by Provincial Education Minister T. S.
