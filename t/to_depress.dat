5|$|The first {{discussion}} {{of improving the}} intersection and grade crossing was a study in 1898, since which there have been about three dozen more. The most recent, a 2009 study of the downtown area, examined the possibility of depressing Route 126 under the grade crossing and intersection {{as well as several}} other alternatives including bypasses. The Route 126 depression was deemed to create barriers to walkability downtown, and the recommended alternative was <b>to</b> <b>depress</b> Route 135 under the intersection to prevent it from being affected by trains passing through the grade crossing. Funds have not yet become available for final design and construction.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were (1) to examine whether perceptions of maternal and paternal behaviors (i. e., support and psychological control) are directly related to mental health (i. e., <b>depressed</b> mood); (2) <b>to</b> assess whether parent-child relationships (i. e., conflict and educational discrepancy) are directly related <b>to</b> <b>depressed</b> mood; and (3) examine whether these perceived parental behaviors and parent-child relationships are indirectly related <b>to</b> <b>depressed</b> mood through the two dimensions of self-esteem (i. e., positive esteem and self-deprecation) in Iranian American emerging adults. Self-report surveys were collected from 121 Iranian American emerging adults from two public universities in California. Results indicated that positive esteem, self-deprecation, maternal and paternal support, maternal and paternal psychological control, mother-child and father-child conflict, and mother-child and father-child discrepancy were all correlated <b>to</b> <b>depressed</b> mood. Furthermore, all four parenting variables were directly or indirectly related (through either positive esteem or self-deprecation) <b>to</b> <b>depressed</b> mood.

5|$|At {{the time}} of the line's planning, Downtown Flushing was a quiet Dutch-colonial-style village; what is now Roosevelt Avenue in the area was known as Amity Street, a major {{commercial}} thoroughfare in the neighborhood. In late 1912, Flushing community groups were petitioning the Public Service Commission (PSC) <b>to</b> <b>depress</b> the proposed line in Flushing into a subway tunnel, rather than an elevated line. Unlike a subway, an el would cause disturbances to the quality of life and a loss in nearby property values, as well as a widening of Amity Street that would cause more changes to the already existing town. One Amity Street property owner compared the planned effect of an elevated Flushing Line on Amity Street to the degradation of Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn after the Myrtle Avenue Elevated was built there. On the other hand, a subway would only require that the street be widened, even though it was more expensive than an elevated of the same length.|$|E
5|$|The 1872 Central Square station {{burned in}} 1889 and was {{replaced}} with a temporary station until a new depot with a 75-foot clock tower was built in 1895 {{on the north side}} of the tracks off Union Street. This station had two side platforms to serve the line's two tracks. As early as 1901, the city began planning to eliminate the numerous grade crossings in downtown Lynn. With 150 trains per day on the main line and 40 on the Saugus Branch, some streets were blocked for as long as half of daylight hours. After legal issues, construction of an elevated viaduct began in September 1909. However, the New Haven Railroad briefly gained control of the Boston and Maine at this time, and intended to fully four-track the line through Lynn in conjunction with plans including a possible railroad tunnel under the harbor. The municipality initially intended to force the railroad <b>to</b> <b>depress</b> the four-track line below grade, but later reached an agreement with the railroad to modify the two-track viaduct for four tracks.|$|E

Instead of removing water, ethylene glycol can also be used <b>to</b> <b>depress</b> the temperature at which hydrates are formed. The purity of glycol used for hydrate suppression (monoethylene glycol) is typically around 80%, whereas the purity of glycol used for dehydration (triethylene glycol) is typically 95 to more than 99%.

25|$|The NWP's {{agenda was}} at times opposed by working class women {{and by the}} labor unions that {{represented}} working class men who feared low-wage women workers would lower the overall pay scale and demean {{the role of the}} male breadwinner. Eleanor Roosevelt, an ally of the unions, generally opposed the NWP policies because she believed women needed protective legislation, not equality. However, the National Woman's Party found protective legislation to relegate women to a lower class, and aimed their work on the ERA and other legislation to combat this second class citizenship status. The NWP argued that protective labor legislation would continue <b>to</b> <b>depress</b> women's wages and prevent women from gaining access to all types of work and parts of society.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{approaches}} {{to the study of}} clinical depression stress the role of interpersonal processes {{in the course of the}} disorder. In particular, the responses of others <b>to</b> <b>depressed</b> persons are thought to be important in the maintenance of depression. Several empirical studies have shown that <b>depressed</b> patients tend <b>to</b> be rejected and to induce negative mood (e. g., depression, anxiety, and hostility) in others. The present study was a further attempt to assess the nature of the depressed person's interaction with his/her social environment. Thirty-four female subjects engaged in same sex face-to-face dyadic interactions with depressed patients, nondepressed patients, or normal controls. Behavioral and self report measures were taken of the response of others <b>to</b> <b>depressed</b> patients, nondepressed patients, and normal controls. Contrary to expectations, no characteristic patterns were identified in the response of others <b>to</b> <b>depressed</b> patients. Several possible explanations of the findings were presented.

25|$|In medieval Islamic literature, {{cataracts}} {{were thought}} to have been caused by a membrane or opaque fluid that rested between the lens and the pupil. The method for treating cataracts in medieval Islam (known in English as couching) was known through translations of earlier publishings on the technique. A small incision was made in the sclera with a lancet and a probe was then inserted and used <b>to</b> <b>depress</b> the lens, pushing it {{to one side of the}} eye. After the procedure was complete, the eye was then washed with salt water and then bandaged with cotton wool soaked in oil of roses and egg whites. After the operation, there was concern that the cataract, once it had been pushed to one side, would reascend, which is why patients were instructed to lie on his or her back for several days following the surgery.|$|E
25|$|Even more importantly, the Third Anglo-Dutch War {{temporarily}} interrupted VOC {{trade with}} Europe. This caused {{a spike in}} the price of pepper, which enticed the English East India Company (EIC) to enter this market aggressively in the years after 1672. Previously, one of the tenets of the VOC pricing policy was to slightly over-supply the pepper market, so as <b>to</b> <b>depress</b> prices below the level where interlopers were encouraged to enter the market (instead of striving for short-term profit maximisation). The wisdom of such a policy was illustrated when a fierce price war with the EIC ensued, as that company flooded the market with new supplies from India. In this struggle for market share, the VOC (which had much larger financial resources) could wait out the EIC. Indeed, by 1683, the latter came close to bankruptcy; its share price plummeted from 600 to 250; and its president Josiah Child was temporarily forced from office.|$|E

25|$|Hoveyda's {{desire to}} attend a French {{university}} in 1938 made the young student jump the gun by entering the country of his dreams without completing specific high school prerequisites required for entry. Cited as being the main reason behind Hoveyda's organizational miscalculation was the possibility of military action by an ostensibly belligerent Nazi Germany. Any future occupation of the country would have hindered his chances of attending a French university. Stranded in France, Hoveyda decided to complete the required high school credits in London, England, a city that would come <b>to</b> <b>depress</b> the young man. Aside from completing his educational requisites, Hoveyda was able to sharpen his command of the English language. His ability to communicate in several languages, including Persian, French, English, Italian, German, and Arabic, helped him climb the political ladder later on in life. Hoveyda's return to France in 1939 would be short lived, nevertheless, due to a brewing diplomatic scuffle between the French government and Reza Shah Pahlavi. Having {{no choice but to}} leave France again, Hoveyda enrolled at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles in Brussels, Belgium, during the same year. His stay at the university would be markedly ephemeral because {{of the effects of the}} German Blitzkrieg which used Belgian territory as an entry route into France.
