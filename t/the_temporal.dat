5|$|Also {{noting the}} unachievable {{ambition}} {{of solving the}} conflict between naturalism and religion, Martin A Greenman, remarks that one must come to the book “with a certain mood”. Too critical a mood would blind the reader to its religious insights, while the sensitivity and depth of its philosophic insights would be lost {{if one were to}} approach it in a too enthusiastically religious mood. Greenman finishes by justifying Stace’s philosophy to logical positivists by quoting from Wittgenstein's Tractatus: “My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them….He must surmount these propositions: then he sees the world rightly” (6. 54.) Dorothy M. Emmet found issue with the notion that the mystical experience is the point of intersection between <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> and eternal orders. She writes that there are difficulties in Stace defining these orders as two distinct “orders of being”, rather than just as a way of speaking, because this then means some statements about <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> order are relevant to what is said about the eternal order and vice versa. Indeed, the interrelation between these two orders is difficult to maintain. She also questioned Stace’s characterisation of mystical consciousness as being the same everywhere.|$|E

5|$|The {{inner ear}} sits within <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> bone {{in a complex}} cavity called the bony labyrinth.

The cochlea is a spiral shell-shaped organ responsible for the sense of hearing. These structures together create the membranous labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of calendars between {{the start of}} the Reformation and the 20th century were quite minimal in their commemorations.

40|$|Functional imaging {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} involvement of <b>the</b> anterior <b>temporal</b> cortex in sentence comprehension. It is unclear, however, whether <b>the</b> anterior <b>temporal</b> cortex is essential for this function. We studied two aspects of sentence comprehension, namely syntactic and prosodic comprehension in temporal lobe epilepsy patients who were candidates for resection of <b>the</b> anterior <b>temporal</b> lobe. Methods: Temporal lobe epilepsy patients (n = 32) with normal (left) language dominance were tested on syntactic and prosodic comprehension before and after removal of <b>the</b> anterior <b>temporal</b> cortex. <b>The</b> prosodic comprehension test was also compared with performance of healthy control subjects (n = 47) before surgery. Results: Overall, temporal lobe epilepsy patients {{did not differ from}} healthy controls in syntactic and prosodic comprehension before surgery. They did perform less well on an affective prosody task. Post-operative testing revealed that syntactic and prosodic comprehension did not change after removal of <b>the</b> anterior <b>temporal</b> cortex. Discussion: <b>The</b> unchanged performance on syntactic and prosodic comprehension after removal of <b>the</b> anterior <b>temporal</b> cortex suggests that this area is not indispensable for sentence comprehension functions in temporal epilepsy patients.
