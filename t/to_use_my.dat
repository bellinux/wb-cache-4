[...] "At the beginning, I wanted to avoid at all cost <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>my</b> name because I was known as the singer for Steve Vai and it wasn't the best publicity to have," [...] he later explained.

However, in The Times, Johnston's success story was described as [...] "the stuff of fairytales", as he was successful despite having been raised in [...] "poverty". Johnston said he did not talk about being bullied because he was told to do so by producers, but [...] "because I believed it would help people who were going through what I had gone through be stronger". Johnston has subsequently visited schools and elsewhere to help other victims of bullying. He said [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>my</b> experience of bullies to help other kids".|$|E
