5|$|After {{starting}} {{the season with}} a 4–2 record, Young lost his last four starts before spending the remainder of the season on the disabled list. His final start occurred on June 14. He was initially placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 19, but on July 31 he was transferred to the 60-day disabled list. In August, he had season ending arthroscopic surgery to repair partial <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> labrum. He had been disabled with shoulder inflammation.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 1990, England played West Germany in a World Cup semi-final {{match at}} Juventus's Stadio delle Alpi in Turin. Gascoigne, having already {{received}} a yellow card during England's 1–0 victory over Belgium {{in the second}} round, was booked for a foul on Thomas Berthold, which meant {{that he would be}} suspended for the final if England won the match. Television cameras showed that he had <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes following the yellow card and made Gascoigne a highly popular figure with the sympathetic British public. The match culminated in a penalty shoot-out, which the Germans won after Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle missed their penalties.|$|E
5|$|On April 8, 2015, Nathan {{was placed}} on the 15-day {{disabled}} list due to a strained right elbow. During a rehab start with the Toledo Mud Hens on April 22, Nathan re-injured his elbow after throwing only 10 pitches. The same night, Nathan underwent MRIs, which tested positive revealing <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow and his pronator teres muscle, and would undergo Tommy John surgery, ending Nathan's 2015 season. Sources projected that this surgery could end Nathan's career, but he was not planning to retire yet.|$|E

5|$|Alexander swore {{the oath}} of loyalty to the Greek {{constitution}} {{on the afternoon of}} 11 June 1917 in the ballroom of the Royal Palace. Apart from the Archbishop of Athens, Theocletus I, who administered the oath, only King Constantine I, Crown Prince George and the king's prime minister, Alexandros Zaimis, attended. There were no festivities. The 23-year-old Alexander had a broken voice and <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes as he made the solemn declaration. He knew that the Entente and the Venizelists would hold real power and that neither his father nor his brother had renounced their claims to the throne. Constantine had informed his son that he should consider himself a regent, rather than a true monarch.|$|E
5|$|In the Ashvamedhika Parva {{the tale}} is narrated with some variation. Uttanka is {{described}} as a brahmin who belonged to the Bhrigu race that lived in a hermitage in the Maru desert. Uttanka was the disciple of the sage Gautama, whom he served for a hundred years. Uttanka was very dear to Gautama, who did not let him go even after Uttanka had completed his education. Uttanka grew old over time. One day Uttanka collapsed while carrying a huge bundle of firewood. Gautama's daughter cried looking at the sight. When called by his guru, Uttanka accosted Gautama, and with <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes asked him why he alone had been retained in the hermitage when thousands of other disciples had been discharged after training. Gautama restored Uttanka's youth, gave his daughter in marriage to Uttanka and then permitted him to leave.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} Test at The Oval, Bradman {{walked out to}} bat in Australia's first innings. He {{received}} a standing ovation from the crowd and three cheers from the opposition. His Test batting average stood at 101.39. Facing the wrist-spin of Eric Hollies, Bradman pushed forward to the second ball that he faced, was deceived by a googly, and bowled between bat and pad for a duck. An England batting collapse resulted in an innings defeat, denying Bradman the opportunity to bat again and so his career average finished at 99.94; if he had scored just four runs in his last innings, {{it would have been}} 100. A story developed over the years that claimed Bradman missed the ball because of <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes, a claim Bradman denied {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

5|$|The {{first hint}} of his death to the Soviet people came at 7:15 p.m. Moscow Time, when the usual {{television}} programs were altered and a pop music concert {{was replaced by a}} documentary on Vladimir Lenin. On Vremya, the Soviet Union's state television newscast, the hosts wore somber clothes instead of their normally informal dress code. At first, Soviet citizens believed it was Andrei Kirilenko who had died, as he had not been present at the 65th anniversary of the October Revolution a few days earlier (he died in 1990). Furthermore, other abrupt changes to the television line-up occurred, such as the appearance of an unscheduled program of war reminiscences and the replacement of an ice hockey game on Channel Two with Tchaikovsky's Pathétique symphony. Brezhnev's death was announced on 11 November simultaneously by Soviet radio and television hosts. The television announcement was read by Igor Kirillov with <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes at 11 a.m. Moscow Time.|$|E

25|$|During the Panthers' {{training}} camp in September 2010, Bitz suffered an injury that was originally reported as a groin strain. The following month, he underwent surgery for a sports hernia and was projected {{to return to the}} lineup within six weeks. By mid-November, he told reporters he was close to returning, but complications in his recovery caused <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> groin and hip labrum, requiring additional surgeries in January and March 2011.|$|E
25|$|Huang Gai {{was hit by}} a stray arrow {{during the}} battle and fell into the river. He was saved by Sun Quan's men but they were not aware of his identity, so they left him lying on a stretcher. When Han Dang passed by, Huang Gai managed to call out to him.

25|$|In January 2006, Paxman was {{the subject}} of an episode of the BBC {{genealogy}} series Who Do You Think You Are?. The documentary concluded that he was descended from Roger Packsman, a 14th-century politician from Suffolk who had changed his name to Paxman in order to impress the electorate (pax being Latin for 'peace'). Paxman's maternal grandmother was born in Glasgow, Scotland. The programme generated much publicity before its transmission by displaying him with <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes on camera when informed that his impoverished great-grandmother Mary McKay's poor relief had been revoked because she had a child out of wedlock.|$|E
25|$|On February 1, 2006 he {{was named}} as Canadian Youth Player of the Year for the 2006 season. In 2007, he helped host Canada compete for the Under-20 World Cup and had been named as one of six ambassadors for the Canadian team during the competition, which was the largest single-sport event ever hosted by Canada. Edgar picked up a groin injury {{three weeks before the}} tournament began, which put doubt over how much he would play. An MRI scan showed no <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{abdominal}} wall, which helped quell fears that he would be lost to injury for the tournament.|$|E
25|$|Loeb is {{best remembered}} nationally for his alleged role in attacking Edmund Muskie through The Union Leader {{in what is}} known locally as the Canuck letter, derailing the Maine senator's 1972 presidential bid. Loeb {{is said to have}} helped in the forgery and {{publication}} of the letter in the paper's op-ed section. The letter slandered French-Canadians, and implied Muskie was prejudiced against them. Muskie's emotional defense of himself in front of the Union Leader offices in Manchester was seen as a sign of weakness and instability. Muskie later claimed that there were not <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes, as many papers reported, but rather snowflakes (as it had been snowing that evening).|$|E

25|$|Samāvartanam (Sanskrit: समावर्तनम्). Most of {{the fourth}} canto deals with {{description}} of nature, especially the rainy season and the Āśrama of Jamadagni in the forest. Śiva permits Paraśurāma to leave in order to returns to his parents' home. When Paraśurāma is leaving, Śiva requests the Rāma Avatāra to forgive him if he disrespected him in any way while instructing him as a guru. On hearing this, Paraśurāma has <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes. After bowing to Śiva and Pārvatī, and meeting their sons Gaṇeśa and Kārttikeya, Paraśurāma sets out to return. The rainy season arrives as Paraśurāma is returning home, and it is described in 44 verses (4.7–4.50). Paraśurāma enters the Āśrama of Jamadagni, which is described in 21 verses (4.61–4.81). Jamadagni and Reṇukā are elated to see their son back. Paraśurāma starts living in the Āśrama and with his actions and character, pleases all the monks and hermits in the Āśrama.|$|E
