25|$|Team: A United States team of 12 elite players competes in the Ryder Cup and the Presidents Cup in {{alternate}} years. The Ryder Cup, pitting {{a team of}} U.S. golfers {{against a}} European team, is arguably the highest profile event in golf, outranking the majors. The Presidents Cup, which matches a team of U.S. golfers against an international team of golfers not eligible for the Ryder Cup, is less well established, but is still the main event of the week when it is played. There is no prize money in these events, so they are irrelevant to <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>list,</b> but an immense amount of pride rides on the results.|$|E
25|$|Zaharias had her {{greatest}} year in 1950 when she completed the Grand Slam {{of the three}} women's majors of the day: the U.S. Open, the Titleholders Championship, and the Women's Western Open, a feat that made her the leader on <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>list</b> that year. Also that year, she reached 10 wins faster than any other LPGA golfer, doing so in one year and 20 days, a record that still stands. She was the leading money-winner again in 1951, and in 1952 took another major with a Titleholders victory, but illness prevented her from playing a full schedule in 1952–53. This did not stop her from becoming the fastest player to reach 20 wins (two years and four months).|$|E

After his win at the Canon Greater Hartford Open, aided by a chip-in in for eagle on No. 14 in the final round, Norman overtook Nick Price as the number one golfer in the world. Later, he won the NEC World Series of Golf, holing a 70-foot birdie chip shot to defeat Billy Mayfair and Nick Price in a playoff on the first hole.

25|$|At {{the end of}} each year, the top 125 in FedEx Cup points (top 125 on <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>list</b> before 2013) {{receive a}} tour card for the {{following}} season, which gives them exemption from qualifying for most of the next year's tournaments. However, at some events, known as invitationals, exemptions apply only to the previous year's top 70 players. Since 2013, players who are ranked between 126–200 in FedEx Cup points (and are not already exempt by other means) are eligible for entry in the Web.com Tour Finals, where they can regain their PGA Tour privileges. Non-exempt players who finish 126th-150th in the FedEx Cup but fail to regain their PGA Tour cards are given conditional PGA Tour status for the season and are fully exempt on the Web.com Tour.
