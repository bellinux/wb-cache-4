25|$|The {{same year}} (1931), Muriel {{told us that}} Mahatma Gandhi (at whose ashram she had stayed in India) was coming over for the Round Table Conference. He had refused to stay at a hotel, but would come if he could live with the working class, so he was to stay at Kingsley Hall....when he arrived, I <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> people in East London waited outside to see him.|$|E
25|$|Speculating on why Weir did {{not receive}} a medal during the Olympics {{even though he had}} good {{technical}} scores, Claude Mailhot of RDS network said, “This may not be politically correct, but do you think he lost points due to his costume and his body language?” Alain Goldberg replied ”They’ll <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> boys who skate will end up like him. It sets a bad example.” Goldberg and Mailhot then made bigoted jokes about how Weir should 'compete in the women’s division'.|$|E
500|$|Writer Naren Shankar {{was happy}} with the overall episode, saying [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Viking scenes worked very well. The sets were magnificent-the forest set was beautiful, and I don't really have any {{complaints}} about it. Everybody really outdid themselves on it." [...] Supervising producer David Livingston praised the prop and wardrobe departments for creating the array of [...] "cool-looking" [...] extras, while Michael Piller said that the whole episode was [...] "well produced". Taylor praised the premise, calling the idea [...] "irresistible" [...] and the overall episode [...] "delightful".|$|E

500|$|According to Hankinson, [...] "One of {{the best}} parts of the episode {{centered}} around Brittany and Santana, but I <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> principals—Artie, Finn, Rachel, and Quinn too—did a great job portraying the tension and distrust pervading the team." [...] Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times felt the show was [...] "absurdly preachy" [...] on the matter of rumors, though he said the episode was [...] "decent". The scene in the motel room with Sam, Rachel, Finn and Sam's brother and sister was called [...] "arguably the most affecting scene of the entire episode" [...] by Handlen, and Poniewozik wrote that [...] "Chord Overstreet sold Sam's feeling of loss". Canning felt otherwise: [...] "It may have had a better impact if we cared more about Sam or if Chord Overstreet had delivered more believable tears, but as things were, it was just some ordinary, blah drama." ...|$|E
500|$|.....I <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> grand leading {{facts of}} {{geographical}} distribution are explicable {{on the theory}} of migration (generally of the more dominant forms of life), together with subsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms. We can thus understand the high importance of barriers, whether of land or water, which separate our several zoological and botanical provinces. We can thus understand the localisation of sub-genera, genera, and families; {{and how it is}} that under different latitudes, for instance in South America, the inhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests, marshes, and deserts, are in so mysterious a manner linked together by affinity, and are likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same continent... On these same principles, we can understand, as I have endeavoured to show, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but of these a great number should be endemic or peculiar;...|$|E
500|$|Sire Records had marketed the [...] "Everybody" [...] single as if Madonna {{was a black}} artist. This {{misconception}} {{was cleared}} by {{the release of the}} music video for the song. Regarding the importance of shooting a music video for the song, Madonna commented that, [...] "If I didn't have a video, I don't <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> kids in the Midwest would know about me. It takes the place of touring. Everybody sees them everywhere. That really {{has a lot to do}} with the success of my album." [...] She invited Sire Records executives, including Stein and Rosenblatt, to the New York nightclub Danceteria. She performed [...] "Everybody" [...] on the dancefloor, wearing a top hat and tails. On the night of the performance, Madonna's friend Haoui Montaug introduced her to the 300 strong audience. Cheered by them, Madonna and her dancers performed their choreographed dance moves, later described as a 'disco act backed by avant-garde dancers.' Seeing the performance, they also realised that Madonna appeared visually stunning. They ordered an in-house video of [...] "Everybody" [...] to be sent to the clubs around the country which used dance videos.|$|E

500|$|With {{the help}} of the monkey, Katy builds a cat toy which she uses to {{distract}} the tiger who ate her boyfriend earlier in the video. She lures it into an area of the jungle, and traps it inside. She comes face-to-face with the tiger {{and the two of them}} roar at each other, until her roar tames the tiger as it sits in front of her submissively. Afterwards, she is shown sitting on a giant grass throne, wearing a flower crown as the rest of the jungle animals sit around her, including the tiger, monkey and elephant. The tiger is shown wearing a collar that says [...] "Kitty Purry", a reference to her real-life cat of the same name. Katy takes selfies with the monkey on her boyfriend's phone, applies lipstick made from berry juice, and gives the elephant a pedicure. She then awakens from sleeping in the plane, leading the viewer to <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> previous events have just been a dream, but walks out of the plane still in the jungle, stretching her arms and yawning with the animals sitting around her.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{title was}} {{revealed}} as The Path of Totality. [...] "The title The Path of Totality {{refers to the}} fact that in order to see the sun in a full solar eclipse, you must be in the exact right place in the exact right time," [...] says Jonathan Davis, explaining the story behind the name. [...] "That's how this album came together. I <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> producers feel the same way. I'm not sure it could ever happen again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thinking, however, {{is not so}} much a {{substitute}} for the earlier processes as a subsidiary addition to them. It only pays in certain cases, and intelligence may be shown also by discerning what they are and when it is wiser to act without thinking. [...] Philosophers, however, have very mistaken ideas about rational action. They tend to think that men ought to <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time, and about all things. But if they did this they would get nothing done, and shorten their lives without enhancing their merriment. Also they utterly misconceive the nature of rational action. They represent it as consisting in the perpetual use of universal rules, whereas it consists rather in perceiving when a general rule must be set aside in order that conduct may be adapted to a particular case.|$|E

60|$|LADY CICELY. He says he couldn't, you know. But {{perhaps the}} real reason was that he didn't like her.

2500|$|Portal told Vanderkloot to [...] "stay handy to the telephone". The {{next day}} Vanderkloot {{was taken to}} Winston Churchill's {{residence}} at No.10 Downing Street. Churchill, clad in robe and slippers, offered him a drink, beginning a relationship that had Vanderkloot flying the Prime Minister on sensitive diplomatic trips across war-torn Europe, Russia, North Africa and the Middle-East. [...] "He took calculated risks," [...] said his son, William III. There {{was a lot more}} risk in flying back then. It was a frontier, and I <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> old pilots will say it, secretly to themselves, that they enjoyed being on their own. It was the wild blue yonder." [...] As Churchill's pilot, Vanderkloot flew Lord Mountbatten to England in June 1942, conveyed the Prime Minister and Chief of the Imperial General Staff Alan Brooke to Egypt in August 1942 to replace Claude Auchinleck commander of the British army in North Africa with Bernard Montgomery and also took Churchill to high-level talks in Moscow with Joseph Stalin, to Turkey to determine that country's wartime intentions, and to the Casablanca Conference in 1943.|$|E
2500|$|Production officially {{began on}} September 10, 2012, with {{shooting}} concluding {{for some of}} the cast on December 21, 2012. After the Christmas break, filming resumed for two weeks in mid January {{for some of the}} main cast and was placed on hold for awards season. Principal photography resumed and concluded in March 2013. Shooting first took place in and around metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia and then moved to Hawaii, to shoot the arena scenes. The cast and crew were on a busy schedule, working 14-hour days and six days a week. In an interview with MTV, Josh Hutcherson confirmed scenes in the film would use IMAX cameras by stating, [...] "They're shooting, I <b>think,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> stuff in the arena is going to be IMAX". Jennifer Lawrence and Liam Hemsworth were in Ringwood, New Jersey shooting District 12 scenes involving snow for the beginning of the film on January 31 and February 1. Jennifer Lawrence confirmed that she would fly out to Hawaii on February 25, the day after she won the Academy Award for Best Actress at the 85th Academy Awards to shoot for the final 9 days along with Claflin and Hutcherson.|$|E
