In 1960, he took over his father's company, leading {{to the creation of}} his first full scale steel roller coaster, The Wildcat, in 1964. In 1970, the first Jet Star II was built for German showman Rick. This ride was the first of many built by the company to feature an electric spiral lift hill. But 1976, Schwarzkopf, along with ride engineer Werner Stengel, created one of their most ground breaking attractions, the famous Revolution roller coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain in California, the first steel roller coaster ever fitted with a vertical loop. This led to the looping roller coaster becoming one of Schwarzkopf's signature attractions, with a few notable examples following soon after: King Kobra at Kings Dominion in Virginia in 1977, both the world's first Shuttle Loop and launched roller coaster, Shockwave at Six Flags Over Texas in 1978, the first double loop roller coaster, and the Looping Star in Germany, the first traveling looping roller coaster, which also opened in 1978.Schwarzkopf Industries grew rapidly with the vast support of various customers praising the company's creations. Throughout the 1970s and notably the 80s, the company became quite a popular name at carnivals, particularly those in Western Europe, producing a number of extremely large transportable rides during this time, including Alpina Bahn in 1983, Dreier Looping (Roughly [...] "Triple Loop" [...] in English) in 1984, Thriller in 1986, and Olympia Looping (Designed by Schwarzkopf but built by BHS) in 1989, all of which premiered in Germany. Outside of Germany, the company was represented by the Intamin firm, and as a result, many older rides credited to Intamin were actually designed and created by Schwarzkopf. Unfortunately, Anton Schwarzkopf's prowess as a businessman was relatively lacking, and his company suffered through several bankruptcies, resulting in the scrapping of many designs and deals with parks. <b>Thiller</b> was the last ride to built by the company before it shut in the mid-late 80's, with portions of the ride being completed by BHS, who, along with Zierer, constructed a few Schwarzkopf designs in the late 80's, including the Bavarian Mountain Railroad roller coasters and the before mentioned Olympia Looping.|$|R

That old comprehensive gig of Naples, with which many pens and pencils have familiarized the reader, is nearly as hard to find there now as the lazzaroni, who have gone out altogether. You may still see it in the remoter quarters of the city, with its complement of twelve passengers to one horse, distributed, two on each <b>thill,</b> four on the top seats, one at each side, and two behind; but in the Toledo it has given place to much finer vehicles. Slight buggies, which take you anywhere for half a franc, are the favorite means of public conveyance, and the private turn-outs are of every description and degree. Indeed, all the Neapolitans take to carriages, and the Strand in London at six o'clock in the evening is not a greater jam of wheels than the Toledo in the afternoon. Shopping feels the expansive influence of the out-of-doors life, and ladies do most of it as they sit in their open carriages at the shop-doors, ministered to by the neat-handed shopmen. They are very languid ladies, as they recline upon their carriage cushions; they are all black-eyed, and of an olive pallor, and have gloomy rings about their fine eyes, like the dark-faced dandies who bow to them. This Neapolitan look is very curious, and I have not seen it elsewhere in Italy; it is a look of peculiar pensiveness, and comes, no doubt, from the peculiarly heavy growth of lashes which fringes the lower eyelid.
