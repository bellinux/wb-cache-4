60|$|It {{was very}} hot, {{and they were}} sitting with the {{shutters}} nearly closed, having resolved not to go out, in order {{that they might be}} ready for the theatre--when the door was opened and Tom <b>Tringle</b> was announced. Tom <b>Tringle</b> had come to call on his cousin.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{the poor}} child takes nothing,--literally nothing," [...] said Lady <b>Tringle,</b> who was frightened for her child. Then the doctor {{went on to}} say that {{arrowroot}} would be good, and sago, but offered no other prescription. Lady <b>Tringle</b> was disgusted by his ignorance, and thought that it might be well to send up to London for some great man. The doctor bowed, and made up his mind that Lady <b>Tringle</b> was an ass. But, being an honest man, and also tender-hearted, he contrived to get hold of Tom before he left the house.|$|E
60|$|Not {{many days}} after Ayala's return her sister Lucy {{came to see}} her. Certain reasons had caused Lady <b>Tringle</b> to stay at Glenbogie longer than usual, and the family was now passing through London {{on their way to}} Merle Park. Perhaps {{it was the fact that}} the Trafficks had been effectually {{extruded}} from Glenbogie, but would doubtless turn up at Merle Park, should Lady <b>Tringle</b> take up her residence there before the autumn was over. That they should spend their Christmas at Merle Park was an acknowledged thing;--to mamma <b>Tringle</b> an acknowledged benefit, because she liked to have her daughter with her; to papa <b>Tringle</b> an acknowledged evil, because he could not endure to be made to give more than he intended to give. That they should remain there afterwards through January, and till the meeting of Parliament, was to be expected. But it was hoped that they might be driven to find some home for themselves if they were left homeless by Sir Thomas for awhile. The little plan was hardly successful, as Mr. Traffick had put his wife into lodgings at Hastings, ready to pounce down on Merle Park as soon as Lady <b>Tringle</b> should have occupied the house a few days. Lady <b>Tringle</b> was now going there with the rest of the family, Sir Thomas having been in town for the last six weeks.|$|E

6000|$|It {{certainly}} was hard upon Lady <b>Tringle.</b> She frowned {{and was going}} to walk on without any acknowledgment, when Lucy timidly went through a form of introduction. [...] "Aunt Emmeline, this is Mr. Hamel. Uncle Tom met him somewhere in the grounds and has asked him to come to luncheon." [...] Then Lady <b>Tringle</b> curtseyed and made a bow. The curtsey and the bow together were sufficient to have crushed the heart of any young man who had not been comforted and exalted by such words as Isadore had heard from Lucy's lips not five minutes since. [...] "And love you," [...] she had said. After that Lady <b>Tringle</b> might curtsey and bow as she would, and he could still live uncrushed. After the curtsey and the bow Lady <b>Tringle</b> passed on. Lucy fell into the rank behind Gertrude; and then Hamel afterwards took his place behind the Honourable Septimus. [...] "If you will sit there, Mr. Hamel," [...] said Lady <b>Tringle,</b> pointing to a chair, across the table, obliquely, at the greatest possible distance from that occupied by Lucy. There he was stationed between Mr. Traffick and Sir Thomas. But now, in his present frame of mind, his position at the table made very little difference to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is going}} on Friday," [...] replied Lady <b>Tringle,</b> doubtingly;--almost as though she thought {{that she would be}} {{subjected}} to further anger because of this delay. But Sir Thomas dropped the subject, and passed on to some matter affecting Tom's outfit. Lady <b>Tringle</b> was very glad to change the subject, and promised that everything should be supplied befitting the hottest and coldest climates on the earth's surface.|$|E
6000|$|One little {{friendly}} word {{in spite}} of our storm on [...] the Tyrolese hill-side!

6000|$|... "You {{may give}} her the {{bracelet}} all the same," [...] said Tom, hurrying out of the room. That Colonel Stubbs should have made an offer to Ayala, and yet have accepted his, Tom <b>Tringle's,</b> confidence! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yours and Lady <b>Tringle's,</b> {{and your}} daughters', no doubt. At any rate, Sir Thomas, you {{will think of}} this again. I am sure you will think of it again. If you find that your daughter's {{happiness}} depends upon it--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{will always}} be so too, my pet. But you should be a bright Dormer among the <b>Tringles,</b> and I will be a dull Dormer among the Dosetts. I shall begrudge nothing, if only we can see each other." ...|$|R
60|$|After that Lady <b>Tringle</b> {{declared}} {{that she would}} return to London at once. No;--she would rather not go in to lunch. She would rather go back at once to the station if they would take her. She had been weeping, and {{did not wish to}} show her tears. Therefore, at Ayala's request, the carriage came round again,--to the great disgust, no doubt, of the coachman,--and Lady <b>Tringle</b> was taken back to the station without having seen any of the Albury family.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am come to you," [...] said Lady <b>Tringle,</b> [...] "on {{a matter}} of very {{particular}} business." [...] Then she paused, and assumed a look of peculiar solemnity.|$|E

6000|$|At {{this moment}} {{the wealth of}} the <b>Tringles</b> seemed to be more to her than it had ever been before,--and her own poverty and destitution seemed to be more absolute. When the word [...] "arrangement" [...] was whispered to her there came upon her a clear idea of all that which she was to lose. She was to be banished from Merle Park, from Queen's Gate, and from Glenbogie. For her there were to be no more carriages, and horses, and pretty trinkets;--none of that abandon of the luxury of money among which the <b>Tringles</b> lived. But she had done it for herself, and she would not say a word in {{opposition}} to the fate which was before her. [...] "What arrangement, aunt?" [...] she said again, in a voice which was intended to welcome any arrangement that might be made.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} {{shall not}} stay there," [...] Lady <b>Tringle</b> said to Mrs. Traffick, [...] "but {{it is as}} well {{to know that they}} will be civil to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She must too," [...] again whispered Lady <b>Tringle.</b> [...] "If {{they are}} told they are to go, what else can they do? Why shouldn't Ayala wish to come?" ...|$|E
6000|$|When Sir Thomas was gone, Lady <b>Tringle</b> {{discussed}} {{the matter with}} Lucy. [...] "Of course, my dear," [...] she said, [...] "if we could make dear Ayala happy--" ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{the time}} came, all the <b>Tringles,</b> {{together}} with the Honourable Mrs. Traffick, started for Glenbogie.

40|$|In the 3 -dimensional Berwald-Moor {{space are}} bingles and <b>tringles</b> constructed, as {{additive}} characteristic objects associated to couples and triples of unit vectors - practically lengths and {{areas on the}} unit sphere. In analogy with the spherical angles, we build two types of bingles (reciprocal and relative). It is shown that reciprocal bingles are norms {{in the space of}} exponential angles (in the bi-space H^, which exponentially define the representation of poly-numbers. It is shown that the metric of this space coincides with the Berwald-Moor metric of the original space. The relative bingles are connected to the elements of the second bi-space (angles, in the space of angles) H^ 2 and allow to provide the doble-exponential representation of poly-numbers. The explicit formulas for relative bingles and <b>tringles</b> contain integrals, which cannot be expressed by means of elementary functions. Comment: Talk presented at FERT- 2009 (Moscow...|$|R

2500|$|The show is punctuated between {{scenes with}} music orchestrated by Wendell Yuponce {{and from a}} music library company called Killer Tracks.

The opening and closing theme song (not mentioned in the credits) is [...] "Frolic" [...] by Italian composer Luciano Michelini. Larry David heard the music used in a bank commercial years before the show was created and thought it had a lighthearted, joyful quality.

6000|$|Then there arose anger both on {{his side}} and on mine; and I [...] must say, insult on his. He told me that I had no {{business}} [...] to suggest {{that you would be}} expelled from his house. I [...] replied that the threat had come, if not from him, then [...] from Lady <b>Tringle.</b> Upon this he accused me of positive [...] falsehood, asserting that your aunt had said nothing of [...] the kind.

6000|$|He left, like a {{thriving}} lover, {{high in the}} good graces of his beloved; but the anger which had fallen on Ayala had not been removed. Then came a rumour that the Marchesa, who was half English, had called Ayala Cinderella, and the name had added fuel to the fire of Augusta's wrath. There was much said about it between Lady <b>Tringle</b> and her daughter, the aunt really feeling that more blame was being attributed to Ayala than she deserved. [...] "Perhaps she gives herself airs," [...] said Lady <b>Tringle,</b> [...] "but really it is no more." ...|$|E
6000|$|Augusta only shook {{herself and}} turned up her nose. Lady <b>Tringle</b> thought it {{necessary}} to say something in defence of her daughter's choice. [...] "Why should not Mr. Traffick dance like any other gentleman?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I daresay; {{but that}} doesn't justify Ayala in running after {{him as she}} does. I believe that all this about the Marchesa is because of Mr. Hamel." [...] This was better than believing that Ayala was {{to be asked to}} sing, and that Ayala was to be fêted and admired and danced with, simply because Ayala was Ayala, and that they, the <b>Tringles,</b> in spite of Glenbogie, Merle Park, and Queen's Gate, were not wanted at all. But when Aunt Emmeline {{signified}} to Ayala that on that particular morning she had better not go to the Marchesa's picnic, Ayala simply said that she had promised;--and Ayala went.|$|R
60|$|There {{was much}} more in which Lucy no doubt went on to declare that, burden as she was, she {{intended}} to be persistent. Hamel, when he received this letter, was resolved to keep the appointment made for him, but his hopes were not very high. He had been angry with Lady Tringle,--in the first place, because of her treatment of himself at Glenbogie, and then much more strongly, {{because she had been}} cruel to Lucy. Nor did he conceive himself to be under any strong debt of gratitude to Sir Thomas, though he had been invited to lunch. He was aware that the <b>Tringles</b> had despised him, and he repaid the compliment with all his heart by despising the <b>Tringles.</b> They were to him samples of the sort of people which he thought to be of all the most despicable. They were not only vulgar and rich, but purse-proud and conceited as well. To his thinking there was nothing of which such people were entitled to be proud. Of course they make money,--money out of money, an employment which he regarded as vile,--creating nothing either useful or beautiful. To create something useful was, to his thinking, very good. To create something beautiful was almost divine. To manipulate millions till they should breed other millions was the meanest occupation for a life's energy. It was thus, I fear, that Mr. Hamel looked at the business carried on in Lombard Street, being as yet very young in the world and seeing many things with distorted eyes.|$|R
6000|$|They {{were in the}} room, together, {{which one}} had {{occupied}} {{and the other was}} to occupy, and their boxes were still upon the floor. Though less than six months had passed since Ayala had come among the rich things and Lucy had been among the poor, Ayala's belongings had become much more important than her sister's. Though the <b>Tringles</b> had been unpleasant they had been generous. Lucy was sitting upon the bed, while Ayala was now moving about the room restlessly, now clinging to her sister, and now sobbing almost in despair. [...] "Of course I know," [...] she said. [...] "What is the use of telling stories about it any longer?" ...|$|R
