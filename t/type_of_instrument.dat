5|$|Musical {{instrument}} {{construction is}} a specialized trade that requires years of training, practice, and sometimes an apprenticeship. Most makers of musical instruments specialize in one genre of instruments; for example, a luthier makes only stringed instruments. Some make only one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> {{such as a}} piano. Whatever the instrument constructed, the instrument maker must consider materials, construction technique, and decoration, creating a balanced instrument that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Some builders are focused on a more artistic approach and develop experimental musical instruments, often meant for individual playing styles developed by the builder himself.|$|E
5|$|Patel and Menon {{backed up}} their {{diplomatic}} efforts by producing treaties {{that were designed}} to be attractive to rulers of princely states. Two key documents were produced. The first was the Standstill Agreement, which confirmed the continuance of the pre-existing agreements and administrative practices. The second was the Instrument of Accession, by which the ruler of the princely state in question agreed to the accession of his kingdom to independent India, granting the latter control over specified subject matters. The nature of the subject matters varied depending on the acceding state. The states which had internal autonomy under the British signed an Instrument of Accession which only ceded three subjects {{to the government of}} India—defence, external affairs, and communications, each defined in accordance with List 1 to Schedule VII of the Government of India Act 1935. Rulers of states which were in effect estates or talukas, where substantial administrative powers were exercised by the Crown, signed a different Instrument of Accession, which vested all residuary powers and jurisdiction in the Government of India. Rulers of states which had an intermediate status signed a third <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>Instrument,</b> which preserved the degree of power they had under the British.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we focus}} on those policy {{instruments}} with monetary incentives {{that are used to}} contain public health expenditure in high-income countries. First, a schematic view of the main cost-containment methods and the variables in the health system they intend to influence is presented. Two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> to control the level and growth of public health expenditure are considered: (i) provider payment methods that influence the price and quantity of health care, and (ii) cost-containment measures that influence the behaviour of patients. Belonging to the first <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments,</b> we have: fee-for-service, per diem payment, case payment, capitation, salaries and budgets. The second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> consists <b>of</b> patient charges and reference price systems for pharmaceuticals. Secondly, we provide an overview of experience in high-income countries that use or have used these particular instruments. Finally, the paper assesses the overall potential <b>of</b> these <b>instruments</b> in cost-containment policies. </p...|$|R

25|$|The {{musician}} Adolph Müller {{described a}} great variety of instruments in his 1833 book, Schule für Accordion. At the time, Vienna and London had a close musical relationship, with musicians often performing in both cities in the same year, so it is possible that Wheatstone was aware of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> and may have used them to put his key-arrangement ideas into practice.|$|E
25|$|Modern lutenists tune to {{a variety}} of pitch standards, ranging from A = 392 to 470Hz, {{depending}} on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> they are playing, the repertory, the pitch of other instruments in an ensemble and other performing expediencies. No attempt at a universal pitch standard existed during the period of the lute's historical popularity. The standards varied over time and from place to place.|$|E
25|$|Lighting {{instruments}} can be broadly {{separated into}} two categories: floodlights, which illuminate a wide area, and spotlights (sometimes known as profiles), which produce a narrower, more controllable light beam. The distinction {{has to do}} with the characteristics of the light produced by the instrument. Spotlights produce a potentially tightly focused light, while floodlights produce a much more diffuse light. Instruments that fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum can be classified as either a spot or a flood, depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> and how it is used.|$|E

25|$|A simple device theorised {{to detect}} the {{expected}} wave motion is called a Weber bar — a large, solid bar of metal isolated from outside vibrations. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> was the first type of gravitational wave detector. Strains in space due to an incident gravitational wave excite the bar's resonant frequency and could thus be amplified to detectable levels. Conceivably, a nearby supernova might {{be strong enough to}} be seen without resonant amplification. With this instrument, Joseph Weber claimed to have detected daily signals of gravitational waves. His results, however, were contested in 1974 by physicists Richard Garwin and David Douglass. Modern forms of the Weber bar are still operated, cryogenically cooled, with superconducting quantum interference devices to detect vibration. Weber bars are not sensitive enough to detect anything but extremely powerful gravitational waves.|$|E
25|$|EDX spectrometers are {{different}} from WDX spectrometers {{in that they are}} smaller, simpler in design and have fewer engineered parts, however they are not as accurate. WDX has greater resolution power than EDX. They can also use miniature X-ray tubes or gamma sources. This makes them cheaper and allows miniaturization and portability. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> is commonly used for portable quality control screening applications, such as testing toys for lead (Pb) content, sorting scrap metals, and measuring the lead content of residential paint. On the other hand, the low resolution and problems with low count rate and long dead-time makes them inferior for high-precision analysis. They are, however, very effective for high-speed, multi-elemental analysis. Field Portable XRF analysers currently on the market weigh less than 2kg, and have limits of detection on the order of 2 parts per million of lead (Pb) in pure sand.|$|E
25|$|Circumstantial {{evidence}} indicates that the baroque bassoon was a newly invented instrument, rather than a simple modification of the old dulcian. The dulcian was not immediately supplanted, but continued to be used well into the 18th century by Bach and others. The man most likely responsible for developing the true bassoon was Martin Hotteterre (d.1712), who may also have invented the three-piece flûte traversière and the hautbois (baroque oboe). Some historians believe that sometime in the 1650s, Hotteterre conceived the bassoon in four sections (bell, bass joint, boot and wing joint), an arrangement that allowed greater accuracy in machining the bore compared to the one-piece dulcian. He also extended the compass down to B by adding two keys. An alternate view maintains Hotteterre {{was one of several}} craftsmen responsible {{for the development of the}} early bassoon. These may have included additional members of the Hotteterre family, as well as other French makers active around the same time. No original French bassoon from this period survives, but if it did, it would most likely resemble the earliest extant bassoons of Johann Christoph Denner and Richard Haka from the 1680s. Sometime around 1700, a fourth key (G♯) was added, and it was for this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> that composers such as Antonio Vivaldi, Bach, and Georg Philipp Telemann wrote their demanding music. A fifth key, for the low E, was added during the first half of the 18th century. Notable makers of the 4-key and 5-key baroque bassoon include J.H. Eichentopf (c. 1678–1769), J. Poerschmann (1680–1757), Thomas Stanesby, Jr. (1668–1734), G.H. Scherer (1703–1778), and Prudent Thieriot (1732–1786).|$|E
