25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E
500|$|To {{promote the}} album in Europe, Kiedis and Frusciante both agreed {{they would make}} the trip. However, it proved {{difficult}} for Frusciante to adapt to life outside of the mansion, after being in near-seclusion for almost 30 days. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "He had such an outpouring of creativity while we were making that album <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> really didn't know how to live life in tandem with that creativity." [...] It was also during this period when Frusciante began to experiment with heroin, which further compromised his mental stability. The European promotional trek took its toll on Frusciante, {{and he decided to}} return home when he and Kiedis reached London.|$|E
500|$|However, Milk's {{assassination}} {{has become}} entwined with his political efficacy, {{partly because he}} was killed at the zenith of his popularity. Historian Neil Miller writes, [...] "No contemporary American gay leader has yet to achieve in life the stature Milk found in death." [...] His legacy has become ambiguous; Randy Shilts concludes his biography writing that Milk's success, murder, and the inevitable injustice of White's verdict represented the experience of all gays. Milk's life was [...] "a metaphor for the homosexual experience in America". According to Frances FitzGerald, Milk's legend {{has been unable to}} be sustained as no one appeared able to take his place in the years after his death: [...] "The Castro saw him as a martyr but understood his martyrdom as an end rather than a beginning. He had died, and with him {{a great deal of the}} Castro's optimism, idealism, and ambition seemed to die as well. The Castro could find no one to take his place in its affections, and possibly wanted no one." [...] On the 20th anniversary of Milk's death, historian John D'Emilio said, [...] "The legacy <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> would want to be remembered for is the imperative to live one's life at all times with integrity." [...] For a political career so short, Cleve Jones attributes more to his assassination than his life: [...] "His murder and the response to it made permanent and unquestionable the full participation of gay and lesbian people in the political process." ...|$|E

"I'm {{not good}} at the books," [...] Mr. Foker said, wagging his head--"never could manage that--Pendennis could--he used to do half the chaps' verses--and yet"--the young gentleman broke out, [...] "you are his guardian; and I hope you will pardon me for saying <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> what we call flat," [...] the candid young gentleman said.|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his goalscoring, pundits have noted Mandžukić for his physical strength, versatility, mobility and fitness, {{as well as his}} ability in the air. He was even given the nickname Đilkoš (pronounced jill-kosh) by Miroslav Blažević, which means brash and unsophisticated, referring to the striker's physical strengths, powerful physique and seemingly endless stamina, rather than his technical ability. Known for his high work-rate and defensive contribution, Mandžukić's former manager at Wolfsburg, Felix Magath, noted his endurance, stating that the striker is 'so fit <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> could play two back-to-back games without stopping even for a minute.' ...|$|E
2500|$|The third {{meeting was}} on 10 December and Law, raging because Asquith {{had not yet}} {{presented}} a concrete way to exclude Ulster, made little progress. Law brushed aside Asquith's suggestions and insisted that only the exclusion of Ulster was worth considering. He later wrote that [...] "My feeling, however, is that Asquith has no hope whatsoever of making such an arrangement and that his present idea is simply to let things drift in the meantime.. I do not understand why he took the trouble of seeing me at all. The only explanation I can give is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is in a funk about the whole position and thought that meeting me might keep the thing open at least".|$|E
2500|$|He toured New Zealand at the season's end {{and due to}} his keeping ability, Australia did {{not send}} a reserve for Barry Jarman. Burge said [...] "Cricket had been {{so much a part}} of Dad's life <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> would have wanted me to go." [...] He started the tour with a 105 against Canterbury and later made 81 not out against Auckland, but did not {{otherwise}} pass 50. New Zealand had Test status at the time, but the Australian Board of Control refused to ratify the matches between the two nations as such. Burge had little impact in three international matches, scoring 115 runs at 28.75 as Australia took the series 10. He ended the New Zealand tour with 310 runs at 38.75.|$|E

2500|$|Harrison Ford {{considers}} Deckard to be human. [...] "That was {{the main}} area of contention between Ridley and myself at the time," [...] Ford told an interviewer during a BBC One Hollywood Greats segment. [...] "I thought the audience deserved one human being on screen that they could establish an emotional relationship with. I thought I had won Ridley's agreement to that, but in fact I {{think he had a}} little reservation about <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> really wanted to have it both ways." [...] Scott suggests that Ford may have since changed his view, although Blade Runner 2049 director Denis Villeneuve claimed that Ford and Scott argue about the issue to this day. Other people involved in the movie's production who have expressed the view that Deckard is human include: David Snyder (art director), M. Emmet Walsh (who portrayed Bryant) and Rutger Hauer (who portrayed Roy Batty).|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] remarked Mrs. Petter, {{somewhat}} severely, [...] "he must be weak in his mind. And if <b>he's</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> {{needed in}} Lethbury." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes. That {{exceedingly}} ugly {{young man}} I remember as the prettiest {{baby in the}} world--not <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is ugly. He is, however, no other than the nephew of Mr. Bertram." ...|$|E
60|$|It's {{always a}} nasty jar {{to wait for}} the laugh and find that the gag hasn't got across. The bearded bloke was visibly discomposed. At <b>that,</b> however, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> would have got by, had he not, at this juncture, {{unfortunately}} stirred Gussie up again.|$|R

6000|$|... 'There's {{only one}} thing,' said Sheila slowly. 'When I last saw my husband, you know, <b>he</b> was, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> {{the least bit}} better.

6000|$|... "Come this time, father," [...] {{he urged}} lately, [...] "for {{it is her}} birthday, and she is twenty-six," [...] which is so great an age to David, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> fears she cannot last much longer.|$|E
