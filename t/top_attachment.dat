50|$|Alexandrium monilatum are armored or thecate {{dinoflagellates}} with {{an outer}} cell wall covered with cellulose plates. A. monilatum is wider at the cingulum or equatorial girdle {{than it is}} tall, and it commonly joins into chains of from two to sixteen individuals, with chains as long as 32 cells in calm seas. The cingulum or groove halfway between {{the top and bottom}} of the organisms single cell is where the pair of flagella are situated. To form chains, A. monilatum cells exude a glue from the apical or <b>top</b> <b>attachment</b> pore of one individual to make it adhere to the antapical or bottom attachment pore of the next individual in the chain. Organisms produced in laboratory cultures do not usually form chains. The nucleus is located in the center of the cell, and A. minilatums many chloroplasts radiate outward from the nucleus. A bioluminescent strain of A. monilatum has been identified from Mississippi Sound in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
40|$|The {{suspension}} {{noise in}} interferometric gravitational wave detectors {{is caused by}} losses {{at the top and}} the bottom attachments of each suspension fiber. We use the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem to argue that by careful positioning of the laser beam spot on the mirror face it is possible to reduce the contribution of the bottom attachment point to the suspension noise by several orders of magnitude. For example, for the initial and enhanced LIGO design parameters (i. e. mirror masses and sizes, and suspension fibers' lengths and diameters) we predict a reduction of ∼ 100 in the "bottom" spectral density throughout the band 35 - 100 Hz of serious thermal noise. We then propose a readout scheme which suppresses the suspension noise contribution of the <b>top</b> <b>attachment</b> point. The idea is to monitor an averaged horizontal displacement of the fiber of length l; this allows one to record the contribution of the <b>top</b> <b>attachment</b> point to the suspension noise, and later subtract it it from the interferometer readout. For enhanced LIGO this would allow a suppression factor about 100 in spectral density of suspension thermal noise. Comment: a few misprints corrected; submitted to Classical and Quantum Gravit...|$|E

For example, for the initial and enhanced LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) design parameters (i. e. mirror masses and sizes, and suspension fibres' lengths and diameters) we predict a reduction of 100 in the `bottom' spectral density throughout the band 35 - 100 Hz of serious thermal noise.

The idea is to monitor an averaged horizontal displacement of the fibre of length l; this allows one to record the contribution of the <b>top</b> <b>attachment</b> point to the suspension noise, and later subtract it from the interferometer readout. This method will allow a suppression factor in spectral density of 7. 4 (l/d^ 2) √Mg/π E), where d is the fibre's diameter, E is it's Young modulus and M is the mass of the mirror. For the test mass parameters of the initial and enhanced LIGO designs this reduction factor is 132 × (l/ 30 cm) (0. 6 mm/d) ^ 2. We offer what we think might become a practical implementation of such a readout scheme. We propose to position a thin optical waveguide close to a fused silica fibre used as the suspension fibre. The waveguide itself is at the surface of a solid fused silica slab which is attached rigidly to the last mass of the seismic isolation stack (see figure 5). The thermal motion of the suspension fibre is recorded through the phaseshift of an optical wave passed through the waveguide. A laser power of 1 mW should be sufficient to achieve the desired sensitivity. ...|$|E

40|$|Cable median {{barriers}} {{are widely used}} {{across the country to}} prevent cross-median crashes. Several years ago, the Midwest States Pooled Fund Program contracted with the Midwest Roadside Safety Facility (MwRSF) to develop a new, non-proprietary, high-tension, 4 -cable median barrier. In the Fall of 2011 and following two failed full-scale vehicle crash tests on prototype barrier systems, it was determined that design modifications were necessary to improve barrier performance. In addition, members of the Midwest States Pooled Fund Program desired to redirect the development effort. Both of the barrier system failures which prompted the re-design effort could be partially attributed to {{the manner in which the}} cables were attached to the posts. Therefore, the cable-to-post attachments at all four cable heights were to be re-designed. The first step in this effort was to determine the minimum design loads associated with horizontal and vertical curves as a function of post spacing. Once the design loads were known, target capacities for the lateral and vertical cable release out of the cable-to-post attachments were determined. The target vertical and lateral cable release capacities for the lower three cables were 225 lb (1. 00 kN) and 6. 00 kips (26. 7 kN), respectively. The <b>top</b> cable-to-post <b>attachment</b> had a target range of 100 to 200 lb (445 to 890 N) for both the lateral and vertical cable release capacities. MwRSF performed seventy dynamic component tests, forty-five static component tests, and one bogie impact test on prototype cable-to-post attachments. Finally, a cable-to-post attachment, consisting of a bolted tabbed bracket, was recommended for use with the lower three cables and provided lateral and vertical cable release capacities of 6. 10 kips (27. 1 kN) and 346 lb (1. 54 kN), respectively. Further, a <b>top</b> cable-to-post <b>attachment,</b> consisting of a straight brass rod with bent ends, was recommended for placement in a notch and provided a vertical and lateral cable release capacity of approximately 175 lb (778 N).

50|$|A branch {{attachment}} {{is where}} a branch {{is attached to the}} trunk of a tree. Three types of branch attachment are recognized due to differences in the anatomical position of buds that form them. Two key components contribute to the mechanical strength and toughness of the attachment: interlocking wood grain at the <b>top</b> of the <b>attachment</b> and an embedded knot that often lies within the attachment. A common malformation of a branch attachment is the inclusion of bark within the join, which can weaken the attachment.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} objectives reported herein {{were based}} on further development of cable-to-post attachment hardware {{for use in the}} non-proprietary high-tension cable barrier system. Specifically, this project aimed to develop and evaluate alternative attachment designs for the bolted, tabbed bracket and evaluate the use of a larger diameter, keeper rod for use in the <b>top</b> cable <b>attachment.</b> From a group of over 25 alternative attachment concepts, two tabbed bracket designs were selected for evaluation through dynamic component testing: 1) the lateral shear plate attachment and 2) the drop-in shear plate attachment. The drop-in shear plate concept did not perform as intended, as the vertical release load was too high and the lateral release loads were too low. Alternatively, the lateral shear plate design provided vertical and lateral release loads very similar to the original bolted, tabbed bracket V 10. However, concerns were raised over the lack of rigidity in the attachment and the ease of installations of the shear plate. Thus, it was recommended that the lateral shear plate design be modified and reevaluated prior to use in the full-scale system. Dynamic bogie or component testing of the 3 / 16 -in. (4. 8 -mm) diameter brass keeper rod provided a quick cable release similar to the previous design. The increased strength of the rod also showed promise in distributing impact loads more uniformly to adjacent posts and helping reduce system deflections. Thus, the 3 / 16 -in. (4. 8 -mm) diameter brass rod was recommended for use in the new high-tension cable barrier system...|$|R
50|$|The 3D {{structure}} of Brassica rapa (Turnip) cyt f has been determined. The lumen-side segment of cyt f includes two structural domains: {{a small one}} above a larger one that, in turn, is on <b>top</b> of the <b>attachment</b> to the membrane domain. The large domain consists of an anti-parallel beta-sandwich and a short haem-binding peptide, which form a three-layer structure. The small domain is inserted between beta-strands F and G of the large domain and is an all-beta domain. The haem nestles between two short helices at the N terminus of cyt f. Within the second helix is the sequence motif for the c-type cytochromes, CxxCH (residues 21-25), which is covalently attached to the haem through thioether bonds to Cys-21 and Cys-24. His-25 is the fifth haem iron ligand. The sixth haem iron ligand is the alpha-amino group of Tyr-1 in the first helix. Cyt f has an internal network of water molecules that may function as a proton wire. The water chain {{appears to be a}} conserved feature of cyt f.|$|R
500|$|The {{skull of}} the holotype, which {{measures}} [...] long, {{is long and}} narrow, with a tapered snout that slopes downwards at an angle of 15°. The eye sockets were roughly {{the same size as}} the temporal openings immediately behind them. A narrow, rounded ridge along the middle of the top surface of the skull extends from near the front of the premaxilla to the back of the eye sockets. The frontal bones form a rectangular bar that separates the eye sockets down the middle. A ridge running across the bar intersects with the forward-extending ridge to produce a dagger-shaped protrusion. The jugal bone, which extends from the bottom of the eye socket back to the level of the temporal openings, is entirely bordered on its bottom by the maxilla. The squamosal bones arch around to form the curved back of the skull, and bear a ridge on <b>top</b> for <b>attachment</b> of neck muscles. There is also a ridge at the point where the two bones fuse. A cast of the braincase shows impressions of the semicircular canals and membranous inner ear, as well as canals of the hypoglossal, accessory, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves, which can also be observed on the bony exoccipital-opisthotic of the braincase. On the imperfectly-preserved lower jaw, the coronoid eminence seems to be relatively low, judging by the narrow and slightly curved top edge of the surangular bone. While the teeth have been lost, they were initially described as long, slender, and awl-shaped, with rough ridges on the outer surfaces. Although it has been suggested that Brancasaurus had very reduced tooth sockets in the premaxilla, as in Leptocleidus, this is impossible to verify because of damage to this portion of the skull.|$|R

While {{recent research}} in electron-transport mechanism on a double strands DNA seems to converge into a consensus, experiments in direct electrical measurements {{on a long}} DNA molecules still lead to a conflicting result. This research investigates experimentally the attachment of DNA molecular wire to high aspect ratio three-dimensional (3 D) metal electrode {{and the effect of}} temperature to its AC electrical conductivity. The 3 -D microelectrode was built on a silicone oxide substrate using patterned thick layers of negative tone photoresist covered by sputtered gold on the <b>top</b> surface. <b>Attachment</b> of ??-DNA to the microelectrode was demonstrated using oligonucleotide-DNA phosphate backbone ligation and thiol-gold covalent bonding. Electrical characterizations based on I-V and AC impedance analysis of several repeatable data points of attachment with varying ??-DNA concentration (500 ng/??L to 0. 0625 ng/??L) showed measurable and significant conductivity of ??-DNA molecular wires. Further study was carried out by measuring I-V and impedance while ramping up the temperature to reach complete denaturation (~ 1100 C) resulting in no current transduction. Subsequent re-annealing of the DNA through incubation in TM buffer at annealing temperature (~ 900 C) resulted in recovery of electrical conduction, providing a strong proof that DNA molecular wire is the one generate the electrical conductivity. ??-DNA molecular wires reported to have differing impedance response at two temperature regions: impedance increases (conductivity decrease) between 40 C [...] 400 C, and then decreases from 400 C until DNA completely denatured (~ 1100 C). The increase conductivity after 400 C is an experimental support the long distance electron transport mechanism referred as "thermal hopping" mechanism. We believe that this research represents a significant departure from previous studies and makes unique contributions through (i) modification of DNA attachment methods has increase the success rate from less than 10 % to be more than 75 % (ii) more accurate direct conductivity measurement of DNA molecular wires facilitated by suspension of the DNA away from the substrate, and (iii) AC impedance measurement of DNA molecular wires with the effect of temperature suggests an experimental evidence of temperature gating mechanism in charge transport through DNA wire that will be very important for further studies...|$|R
