5|$|Production on {{the film}} was {{temporarily}} shut down after a fire destroyed several soundstages at Paramount Studios, {{one of which was}} adjacent to the set for the Genesis planet. Initially, the set's pyrotechnics were suspected of causing the fire, but the cause was ruled to be arson. Shatner was among the cast members who grabbed fire hoses to stop the flames. Correll hoped the place would burn down so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> his chance to film in Hawaii. While most of the set was undamaged, holes {{in the side of the}} building had to be covered with heavy black curtains to prevent outside light from leaking in.|$|E
5|$|England made 141 and Bradman {{forced them}} to follow on. Miller removed Hutton again, this time caught by Sid Barnes from the first ball of the innings. He {{combined}} with Barnes 45 minutes later to remove Hutton's opening partner Washbrook to leave England at 3/33. The pitch, still rain-affected, hastened England's defeat by an innings and 332 runs within 44 overs. Miller finished with 2/17 from 11 overs in the second innings to end with match figures of 9/77. England had fallen to their heaviest Test defeat on Australian soil, losing 15 wickets {{in the space of}} 210 minutes on the fifth day. Miller's highly productive Ashes debut led to further speculation as to whether he was willing to end his Test career to turn professional in England. Miller continued to ignore Rawtenstall's requests for confirmation and refused to comment on the issue to the media, hoping <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> a better job offer in Australia in the meantime.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} charge, Manekshaw reached the {{conclusion}} that poor leadership had been {{a significant factor in}} IV Corps' failure in the war with China. He felt that his foremost responsibility was to improve the morale of his demoralized soldiers, and issued orders to advance to the positions lost in the war, which kept morale up. Just five days into his command, Nehru visited the headquarters with his daughter Indira Gandhi and the COAS, and found the troops advancing. Nehru stated {{that he did not want}} any more men to die. The COAS assured him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> the orders rescinded. Manekshaw retorted that the COAS should allow him to command his troops the way he wished or send him to a staff appointment. Gandhi intervened and told Manekshaw to go ahead. Though Gandhi had no official position, she had great influence in the government. The next task Manekshaw took-up was to reorganize the troops in North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA). He took measures to overcome the shortages of equipment, accommodation, and clothing.|$|E

5|$|In The King of Fighters '99 Iori is {{a secret}} {{character}} in most versions of the game. Iori can be faced as a bonus fight {{in the end of}} the game if the player manages to get a high score. In the story, Iori discovers the creation of Kyo clones and enters the annual tournament where he finds those responsible, an organization named NEST. Iori follows the battles in secret and fights against the Nests' agents to continue his fight against Kyo. An assistant version of his character, named Striker, also appears for Iori in The King of Fighters 2000 but with an outfit based on his illustrations from artbooks. In The King of Fighters 2001, an agent named Seth invites Iori to join his team for the next King of Fighters tournament, presuming <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> his shot against Kyo. While his regular form appears in KOF 2002, his Orochi form is also featured in the PlayStation 2 port from the game as well as the remake of KOF '98. In The King of Fighters 2003, Chizuru appears to both Kyo and Iori, requesting that they form a team and investigate suspicious activities concerning the Orochi seal. During the investigation, the team is ambushed by the fighter Ash Crimson, who plans to get the power from the descendants of the clans who sealed Orochi and steals the ones from Chizuru. In the following video game, Iori and Kyo form a team once again with Kyo's student Shingo Yabuki to fill Chizuru's spot to stop Ash. At the end of the tournament, the strengthening presence of Orochi causes Iori to enter the Riot of Blood state, in which he attacks his comrades. Ash appears afterward and defeats Iori, stealing his powers. Iori is a playable character in The King of Fighters XII. Iori is featured with a different outfit, and with a new moveset, that does not use purple flames. Like each character, he does not have a team. Iori's appearance in The King of Fighters XIII sees him teamed with his former team members from the 1996 tournament, Mature and Vice, who return as spirits. He recovers his flames in his ending and appears as downloadable content in this form. He is set to return in the upcoming The King of Fighters XIV, and he is also the one who tracked Orochi's weakened body in the middle of Hungary when Verse's destructions scatters every revived souls including Orochi and Ash who were sealed inside the monster's across the globe after the tournament is over, thus sealing the weakened snake with the help from Kyo and Chizuru immediately.|$|E

Nick Davies was subsequently fired from the Daily Mirror for gross misconduct.

Meanwhile, Guerrero, despite having met Hounam and Vanunu at the airport when they arrived in London and receiving an assurance from Hounam <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> his money, sold the story to the tabloid Sunday Mirror, whose owner was Robert Maxwell. In 1991, a self-described former Mossad officer or government translator named Ari Ben-Menashe claimed that Maxwell, allegedly an agent for Israeli intelligence services, had tipped off the Israeli Embassy about Vanunu in 1986. In sharing his story with the Sunday Mirror, Guerrero forfeited the agreed-upon payment of $25,000 from The Sunday Times.|$|E
25|$|Born in Rutherglen, Bryson {{began his}} career with non-league side Westwood Rovers. He signed a {{professional}} contract with Scottish First Division club Clyde {{at the beginning of}} the 2003–04 season. He turned down the opportunity to sign for Scottish Premiership club Motherwell because he wanted to play regular first team football and he didn't feel <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> that at Motherwell. He didn't make a first team appearance that season, but was loaned out to junior outfit East Kilbride Thistle for the latter part of the season. He made a big impression in his time at East Kilbride, scoring two goals in eight league appearances and winning the club's Young Player of the Year award.|$|E
25|$|Key {{was born}} in Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, where his father worked in the brickfields. At the age of six, his father died and he was brought up by his mother alone; the family were very poor and not only did his mother have {{to work as a}} charlady, Key himself was needed to work on {{deliveries}} for a local draper. The family were largely dependent on poor relief under the Poor Law: in later life Key often remembered collecting 1s. 6d. and two quartern loaves of bread, being two-fifths of a pound. He claimed to have promised his mother at the age of nine <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> into Parliament and repeal the Poor Law.|$|E

25|$|After the season, {{majority}} owner Pollin fired Jordan as team president, much to {{the shock}} of players, associates, and the public. Jordan felt betrayed, thinking <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> his ownership back after his playing days ended, but Pollin justified Jordan's dismissal by noting that Jordan had {{detrimental effects on the}} team, such as benching Hughes for Tyronn Lue, making poor trades, and using the team's 2001 1st round draft pick on high schooler Kwame Brown. Without Jordan in the fold the following year, the Washington Wizards were not expected to win, and they did not. Despite the signing of future All-Star point guard Gilbert Arenas, in a move that was ironically made possible by Jordan's prior cap-clearing maneuvers as a team executive, the team stumbled to a 25–57 record in the 2003–04 season.|$|E
25|$|Mainwaring {{received}} a letter of support from Labour Party leader George Lansbury, and an appeal from the President, Vice-President and General Secretary of the South Wales Miners' Federation was made for all miners and their families to vote for him. The Labour Party had won easily in a straight fight with Arthur Horner at the previous election, but {{the decision of the}} Liberal Party to fight an energetic campaign (the Liberal candidate was allied with David Lloyd George and opposed to the National Government) was thought to have given the party a scare because Labour had benefited from Liberal votes in 1931. Mainwaring predicted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> between 20,000 and 22,000 votes. In the event, Mainwaring won with 14,127 votes, with Horner second having increased his vote compared with 1931.|$|E
25|$|Olsufiev's pickets were {{overrun by}} 10:00 am and {{although}} badly outnumbered, the Russian decided to fight rather than retreat. His decision was based {{partly on the}} mistaken hope <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> reinforcements from Blücher in time to prevent a disaster. The correct decision {{would have been to}} retreat east to Étoges, but the Russian general had been criticized for the loss of the château during the Battle of Brienne on 29 January. He was also blamed for mishandling his troops at La Rothière and Sacken wanted him hauled before a court-martial. In the circumstances, Olsufiev chose to battle it out in order to clear his name. He did, however, send messengers to the Prussian army commander telling his superior what was occurring. In the event, Blücher brushed aside Olsufiev's couriers, insisting that Napoleon was not on the scene and that the attackers were no more than 2,000 French partisans.|$|E

25|$|In 1163, Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos {{installed}} Nemanja's {{older brother}} Tihomir as Grand Župan of Rascia in Desa's place, which disappointed Nemanja greatly, as he expected <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> the throne. Nemanja met Emperor Manuel in Niš in 1162, {{who gave him}} the region of Dubočica to rule over and declared him independent. The Emperor gave him a Byzantine court title as {{it was important for}} the Emperor to have the borderlands of the Empire ruled by loyal leaders. Nemanja's Serb squadrons fought in the Imperial Army in 1164 in Srem during the wars against the Kingdom of Hungary. Nemanja ruled independently; he built the Monastery of Saint Nicholas in Kuršumlija and the Monastery of the Holy Mother of Christ near Kosanica-Toplica, without the Tihomir's approval. His brothers invited him to a council at Ras, supposedly to resolve the situation, but instead they imprisoned him in a nearby cave. Nemanja's supporters advised church leaders that Tihomir had done this because he disapproved of church building, something that would later help Nemanja greatly. A later legend claimed Saint George himself freed Nemanja from the cave.|$|E
25|$|After Madson retired {{all three}} Cubs he faced {{in the top}} of the eighth, the Nationals staged their final rally in the bottom of the inning. Joe Maddon had called in Cubs closer Wade Davis to get the last out of the seventh inning and kept him in to pitch the eighth and ninth in the hope <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> a seven-out save, an unusually long outing for him. Davis started the eighth by walking Daniel Murphy and Anthony Rendon, but then got pinch-hitter Adam Lind to ground into a double play that {{advanced}} Murphy to third. Michael A. Taylor then singled to drive in Murphy and cut Chicago's lead to 9-8, and light-hitting catcher José Lobatón who had replaced Wieters in the game, singled, advancing Taylor to second. With Davis clearly tiring and the top of the Nationals′ order coming to bat, Washington′s hopes rose that they could at least tie the game. Trea Turner came to the plate and had worked his at-bat to a 2-1 count when catcher Willson Contreras threw to first to pick off Lobatón. Lobatón was called safe, but the Cubs challenged the call and the video replay revealed that Lobatón′s foot had lost contact with the bag for less than a second while Anthony Rizzo was applying the tag. Lobatón was ruled out, and the inning ended.|$|E
25|$|At the Royal Rumble, AJ Styles {{lost the}} WWE Championship to John Cena. Styles was {{immediately}} {{entered into the}} WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, but SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon also promised Styles <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> a one-on-one rematch for the title {{if he did not}} win the title back at the pay-per-view. At Elimination Chamber, Bray Wyatt eliminated both Cena and Styles to win the championship. Cena then immediately invoked his rematch clause, but Styles intervened, stating he should get his first. SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan then scheduled a triple threat match for the WWE Championship, where Wyatt retained. Randy Orton then refused his right as the Royal Rumble winner to face Wyatt for the title at WrestleMania 33, so Bryan scheduled a 10-man battle royal to determine a new number one-contender. Styles was entered into the battle royal, which ended in a draw between him and Luke Harper. The two faced each other in a number one contender's match the following week. Styles pinned Harper, but the referee did not see Harper's foot on the rope. Shane came out and restarted the match, which angered Styles, even though he would defeat Harper once again. At the conclusion of the show, Orton reclaimed his right to face Wyatt at WrestleMania. Bryan and Shane decided that Styles would have to compete in another number one contender's match, this time against Orton, who won. After the show, an angered Styles got into a heated argument backstage with Shane. The following week, an irate Styles said that he was tired of Bryan and Shane. He said because of them, {{he did not have a}} match at WrestleMania, but Orton, who committed arson, did. Later backstage, Styles attacked Shane and threw him through a car window. Styles was subsequently (kayfabe) fired by Bryan, but at the end of the show, an injured Shane challenged Styles to a match at WrestleMania, which Styles accepted. At the end of the following week's episode, Shane called out Styles and the two brawled, which ended with Shane performing a Leap of Faith on Styles through the broadcast table. The following week, the two had a contract signing to make the match official and the two traded barbs.|$|E
