25|$|While {{scientists}} {{were trying to}} create a new antidepressant to inhibit the NE re-uptake they accidentally synthesised two new compounds, named <b>talopram</b> and talsupram. The two compounds where not marketed in spite of being potent SNRIs {{because of the fact that}} number of suicide attempts were reported in clinical trials. With minor changes to the chemical structure of <b>talopram</b> (figure 6), including a single 6-cyano (CN) substitution, {{scientists were}} able to convert <b>talopram</b> into a potent SSRI, called citalopram. But citalopram can also be viewed as a constrained analogue of paroxetine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Talopram</b> (Lu 3-010), {{also known}} as phthalapromine, is a {{selective}} norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) which was researched {{for the management of}} depression in the 1960s and 1970s but was never commercialized. Along with talsupram, <b>talopram</b> is structurally related to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram, as well as to melitracen: ...|$|E

50|$|Talsupram (Lu 5-005 or Lu 5-003) is a {{selective}} norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) which was investigated as an antidepressant in the 1960s and 1970s but was never marketed.

50|$|Clomipramine was a {{predecessor}} to {{the development}} of the more recent SSRIs. There was, in fact, a time prior to the SSRIs when selective NRIs were being considered (c.f. <b>talopram</b> and melitracen). In fact, it is also believed that the selective NRI nisoxetine was discovered prior to the invention of fluoxetine. However, the selective NRIs did not get promoted in the same way as did the SSRIs, possibly due to an increased risk of suicide. This was accounted for on the basis of the energizing effect that these agents have. Moreover, NRIs have the additional adverse safety risk of hypertension that is not seen for SSRIs. Nevertheless, NRIs have still found uses.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} create novel {{antidepressants}} without oxidative tissue damage, less side effects and good bioavailability, structurally simple selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with a isobenzofuran skeleton were designed based on the SAR of the target molecule- Citalopram and <b>Talopram.</b> As a result, designed molecules obey the Lipinski rule of 5 and also give moderate to good druglikness score...|$|E
40|$|Inhibitors of the {{serotonin}} transporter (SERT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET) {{are widely}} used {{in the treatment of}} major depressive disorder. Although SERT/NET selectivity is a key determinant for the therapeutic properties of these drugs, the molecular determinants defining SERT/NET selectivity are poorly understood. In this study, the structural basis for selectivity of the SERT selective inhibitor citalopram and the structurally closely related NET selective inhibitor <b>talopram</b> is delineated. A systematic structure-activity relationship study allowed identification of the substituents that control activity and selectivity toward SERT and NET and revealed a common pattern showing that SERT and NET have opposite preference for the stereochemical configuration of these inhibitors. Mutational analysis of nonconserved SERT/NET residues within the central substrate binding site was performed to determine the molecular basis for inhibitor selectivity. Changing only five residues in NET to the complementary residues in SERT transferred a SERT-like affinity profile for R- and S-citalopram into NET, showing that the selectivity of these compounds is determined by amino acid differences in the central binding site of the transporters. In contrast, the activity of R- and S-talopram was largely unaffected by any mutations within the central substrate binding site of SERT and NET and in the outer vestibule of NET, suggesting that citalopram and <b>talopram</b> bind to distinct sites on SERT and NET. Together, these findings provide important insight into the molecular basis for SERT/NET selectivity of antidepressants, which can be used to guide rational development of unique transporter inhibitors with fine-tuned transporter selectivity...|$|E
