5|$|During this period, Roman {{soldiers}} seem to {{have been}} modelled after those of the Etruscans to the north, who themselves are believed to have copied their style of warfare from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the phalanx formation into the Roman army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, Servius Tullius (ruled 578 to 534 BC). According to Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>before</b> it.|$|E
5|$|Each {{successive}} {{scene in}} the sequence was shorter than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>before</b> it by exactly one frame. The scene where Bart writes his confession was done as one long take to balance the shorter scenes elsewhere in the episode. It was animated in the United States by Dan Haskett. There were a few problems with the finished animation for the episode. The banana in the opening scene was colored incorrectly, as the Korean animators were unfamiliar with the fruit, and the final bathtub scene was particularly problematic, including issues with lip sync. The version in the broadcast episode {{was the best of}} several attempts.|$|E

25|$|The 2010 season saw Janne Andersson {{leave as}} Halmstads BK manager and being {{replaced}} by Lars Jacobsson, the former assistant manager. Lars continued with Janne's 4-5-1 system, Raskaj played most of his matches {{on the right side}} of the midfield, few times being used as left winger, scoring his second goal early in the season in Halmstad's 4-0 win over Åtvidabergs FF. The 2011 season started as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>before,</b> Lars Jacobsson left the club and be replaced by Spanish Josep Clotet Ruiz, along with the new manager came a number of Spanish midfielders, which saw Anel moved from the starting lineup to the bench in the beginning of the league season, against many people's expectations. In the mid of the 2011 season the Spanish players left as their loan ended with the club and Clotet Ruiz was sacked following a long serie of poor results, under new manager Jens Gustafsson Raskaj returned to the starting lineup, he was however unable to help Halmstad from bein relegated by the end of the season.|$|E

Although the French had won, the Russian army had accepted, and withstood, the major battle Napoleon had hoped would be decisive. Napoleon's own account was: [...] "The most terrible of all my battles was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>before</b> Moscow.

500|$|Not {{everything}} she encounters is beautiful, however, and she juxtaposes her distaste for the German working class with her delight with French servants. Although politically liberal, Mary Shelley is aesthetically repelled by the Germans and therefore excludes them. Unlike the non-discriminating Claire Clairmont, Shelley feels {{free to make}} judgments of the scenes around her; Shelley writes that Claire [...] "on looking at this scene...exclaimed, 'Oh! this is beautiful enough; let us live here.' This was her exclamation on every new scene, and as each surpassed <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>before,</b> she cried, 'I am glad we did not stay at Charenton, but let us live here'". Shelley also compares herself positively to the French peasants who are unaware that Napoleon has been deposed.

Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone praised the video, calling it one of the best clips from the album. James Montgomery from MTV News wrote: [...] "Aguilera kicked off her Back to Basics reinvention with this appropriately anachronistic clip, where she vamps through Prohibition-era Harlem". The music video was nominated for four MTV Video Music Awards in 2006, they are: Video of the Year, Best Female Video, Best Pop Video and Best Choreography; however, the video did not win any of them.|$|E
