25|$|Sørvágur {{has always}} been a place where fishery has been very dominant. In older times it was said, that the only thing {{necessary}} for survival in Sørvágur was <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> fishing rod and a pot to cook the fish. The fishing industry also plays a vital role in the industrial environment in Sørvágur today (2005). Today there is a modern fish factory producing mainly salt fish; a fish farm raising salmon; one fish market; one major fish factory ship, which produces fish directly to the British market; 6 smaller fishing trawlers and 50+ small fishing boats.|$|E

[...] "Living in Ann Arbor, and seeing {{all the things that}} embody a great university, you learned that there were highly successful people in athletics, and it just made you want to feel a part of it. Then, as you got older, and you got more deeply involved in the game yourself, you just hoped <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance to play in college -- and after watching all those games at Michigan Stadium, that maybe Michigan would take a chance on you." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Jigsaw {{did not come}} until months later, when Whannell was working at a job he was unhappy with and began having migraines. Convinced it was a brain tumor, {{he went to a}} neurologist to have an MRI and while sitting nervously in the waiting room he thought, [...] "What if you were given the news <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> tumor and you were going to die soon? How would you react to that?" [...] He imagined the character Jigsaw having been given one or two years to live and combined that with the idea of Jigsaw putting others in a literal version of the situation, but only giving them a few minutes to choose their fate.|$|E

'Our niece's position, or {{supposed}} position, is much {{changed by}} our brother Francis's death,' said Miss Lavinia; 'and therefore we consider our brother's opinions as regarded her position as being changed too.

2500|$|Another Spanish businessman, who {{supervised}} ABM's {{operations in}} Equatorial Guinea from 1995 to 1997, said Teodorín [...] "would call {{us to come}} to his office, which meant wearing a suit and tie. He would keep you waiting for five hours and then appear wearing shorts. He would then tell you how much he wanted you to pay him, and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> week to do so, saying: 'If you don't pay, we will confiscate the machinery and give your concession to the Chinese.' We had to flee the country. He was demanding millions. The only ones who stayed were those who paid him." [...] Yet another Spanish firm, which was forced to work with a local company on whose board of directors Teodorin sat, [...] "had to pay commissions at every stage of the way" [...] and was confronted [...] "with permits and other obstacles"; after the firm had filled a warehouse with timber, one member of the firm was arrested and imprisoned on trumped-up charges of rape, apparently a standard way of treating foreign businesspeople. [...] "He caught malaria and had a fever....In return for being allowed to leave, he had to agree to leave all his money and the timber warehouse behind." ...|$|E

My dear father: AMERICAN HORSE:- I {{want to tell you}} something, and it makes me feel very glad. You tell me that my brother is married and that makes me feel very glad. My cousins, and brothers, and I are all very well, at this Carlisle School. We would like to see you again. I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. I hear that they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad. If you can, come again, and tell me if you can come again, when. I {{want to tell you that}} some more girls and boys came here. Twenty-five. Fifteen of them are girls. There are a great many of us here now, and Capt. Pratt is very kind to us. That is all I want to say now. Give my love to all of my friends. Your daughter, Maggie Stands-Looking." ...|$|E
