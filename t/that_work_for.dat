Some of the wrestlers he has a significant hand in training includes Mini-Estrellas Acero, Aéreo, Mercurio and Pentagoncito, female wrestlers Goya Kong, Lady Afrodita and Skadi. He also helped train several of the male wrestlers currently working for CMLL include Akuma, Blue Panther Jr., El Cuatrero, Disturbio, Flyer, Gran Guerrero, The Panther, Pólvora, Puma, Sanson, Soberano Jr., Star Jr. and Tiger.|$|E
5|$|The group {{assumes that}} {{completing}} this task {{will result in}} the granting of their wishes. The Wicked Witch of the West (Miss Piggy) sees them coming and consults with her pet Foo-Foo and her henchman Johnny Fiama. When the Wicked Witch of the West plans to have either her pack of 40 great man-eating wolves, a flock of 40 crows of despair, a swarm of angry black bees, a group of vicious squirrels, or a group of bloodthirsty cockatoos to do away with them, Johnny tells her that the animals <b>that</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> her are unavailable due to various reasons. This forces her to resort to using her Magic Biker Cap to call Sal Minella and the other Flying Monkeys (played by Sweetums, Crazy Harry, Black Dog, Calico, Old Tom, Spotted Dick, and Aretha from Fraggle Rock) to deal with them. The Witch and the Flying Monkeys capture Dorothy and Lion while Scarecrow and Tin Thing are dismantled by the Flying Monkeys.|$|E

Green Goblin is later shown having gathered a new gang of followers together in the sewers formed from discarded members of other villains' gangs like Vulture, Owl and the third White Dragon's gangs. These henchmen escaped their organizations unharmed because Superior Spider-Man is more focused on the larger threats (where the original Spider-Man would focus on individuals).|$|E

25|$|The best {{treatment}} for cutaneous leishmaniasis is not known. Treatments <b>that</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> one species of leishmania {{may not work}} for another; {{it is recommended that}} advice of a tropical medicine or geographical medicine specialist be sought. Ideally, every effort should be made to establish the species of leishmania by molecular techniques (PCR) prior to starting treatment. In the setting of a developing country, there is often only one species present in a particular locality, so it is usually unnecessary to speciate every infection. Unfortunately, leishmaniasis is an orphan disease in developed nations, and almost all the current treatment options are toxic with significant side effects. The most sound {{treatment for}} cutaneous leishmaniasis thus far is prevention.|$|E
25|$|When these federal pay for {{performance}} systems failed, many were surprised {{because it had}} worked so well within the private sector. Much of this failure was attributed {{to the fact that}} most of the research on pay {{for performance}} had been done in the private rather than public sector. These perplexing and inconsistent results between the private and public sectors led academia to question why pay-for-performance programs in the public sector were not as effective. Research revealed that two main factors contributed to poor public sector motivation and performance: (1) the public sector has unique budgeting restrictions that make it difficult to effectively implement such a program, and (2) the type of motivation that affects employees in the federal public sector is different from the motivators <b>that</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> employees of private business firms.|$|E

500|$|The {{complexity}} of the pilot's script (and the show's concept) was cited as a potential issue for the series. Salke considered that viewers enjoyed the series' mythology as it affected the characters, despite the show's Sliding Doors–like script.

[...] He stated <b>that</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> Awake was hard, but enjoyable.

500|$|Mansfield first sat {{in court}} on 11 November 1756, {{and at the}} time had [...] "a very low {{estimate}} of the Common Law of England which he was to administer". The legal system had been put together in the period immediately after the Norman conquest of England, and was completely unsuited to the 18th century, when Britain was [...] "the greatest manufacturing and commercial country in the world". Mansfield immediately began to reform the way the law and courts worked. One of his first acts as Lord Chief Justice was to change the system for submitting motions. Every day the court was in session, all barristers were invited to submit motions, in order of their seniority as barristers. Because they were allowed to submit as many motions as they wanted, by the time junior barristers were allowed to submit their motions, it was normally the end of the day. This meant that almost all the work went to the senior barristers, who were so overworked that they often did not have time to prepare properly before going to court. In addition it meant <b>that</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> junior barristers was scarce, hindering their careers. Mansfield changed the system so that barristers were allowed to submit only one motion a day, and if not all barristers had been heard {{by the end of the}} day, they could continue where they left off the next morning.|$|E
