25|$|USS <b>Tullibee</b> (SSN-597), {{a unique}} submarine, {{was the second}} ship of the United States Navy to be named for the <b>tullibee,</b> any of several {{whitefishes}} of central and northern North America.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tullibee</b> was {{the result}} of Project Nobska, a study ordered in 1956 by Admiral Arleigh Burke, then Chief of Naval Operations, from the Committee on Undersea Warfare of the National Academy of Sciences. That report {{emphasized}} the need for deeper-diving, ultraquiet submarine designs using long-range sonar. <b>Tullibee</b> incorporated three design changes based on Project Nobska. First, it incorporated the first bow-mounted spherical sonar array. This required the second innovation: amidships, angled torpedo tubes. Thirdly, <b>Tullibee</b> was propelled by very quiet turbo-electric transmission powered by a S2C reactor.|$|E
25|$|In early 1971, the {{submarine}} returned to developmental exercises {{once more to}} work on SSN tactics and also made a port visit to Cape Canaveral, Florida. Participating in a major NATO exercise in the western Atlantic, <b>Tullibee</b> visited Halifax, Nova Scotia, before she received the Meritorious Unit Commendation for her contingency operations in the Mediterranean Sea {{during the previous year}} (from 9 September to 31 October 1970). For the remainder of the year 1971, <b>Tullibee</b> operated in the western Atlantic on NATO and ASW exercises. During this period, too, <b>Tullibee</b> received the Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy for significant improvement in the ship's battle efficiency and readiness for that fiscal year.|$|E
25|$|On 26 April 1983, Commander David W. Candler {{relieved}} as {{the ninth}} Commanding Officer. On two occasions between April 1983 and February 1984 difficulties with the propulsion system required {{the ship to}} return to New London for repairs. In November 1985, the ship departed New London for her fifth and final extended deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. While deployed she conducted several ASW operations for Commander Sixth Fleet and participated in a major NATO ASW exercise. <b>Tullibeeâ€™s</b> assignment to the Sixth Fleet during freedom of navigation exercises, involving combat with Libyan forces, resulted in her crew receiving a Navy Expeditionary Medal {{as well as her}} first award of a Navy Unit Commendation. The ship returned to New London, Connecticut, in April 1986 after having spent five months deployed.|$|R
25|$|At 273 {{feet long}} and 2,640 tons displacement, USS <b>Tullibee</b> was the {{smallest}} nuclear-powered attack submarine in the US submarine fleet. The initial manning complement was 7 officers and 60 enlisted men. However before inactivation, the crew included 13 officers and over 100 enlisted men.|$|E
25|$|Following her {{shakedown}} in January 1961, <b>Tullibee</b> {{engaged in}} sonar evaluations and nuclear submarine tactical exercises with Submarine Developmental Group 2, {{operating out of}} Naval Submarine Base New London, Connecticut, into 1963. During this period, the ship visited Bermuda on several occasions, as well as San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E
25|$|Decommissioned and {{stricken}} {{from the}} Naval Vessel Register on 25 June 1988, ex-Tullibee entered the Navy's Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program on 5 January 1995. Recycling was completed on 1 April 1996. One of the fairwater planes from the <b>Tullibee</b> {{can be seen}} as part of a permanent art installation on the shore of Lake Washington in Seattle.|$|E
25|$|On 24 July 1979, Commander Daniel J. Koczur {{relieved}} as {{the eighth}} Commanding Officer. During August 1979, <b>Tullibee</b> entered Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for its {{third and final}} major overhaul. This overhaul lasted until October 1982 (a total of 39 months). After leaving the shipyard, the remaining months of 1982 were spent conducting various operations, which provided refresher training for the crew.|$|E
25|$|The {{contract}} to build <b>Tullibee</b> {{was awarded to}} the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation on 15 November 1957. Her keel was laid down in Groton, Connecticut, on 26 May 1958. She was launched on 27 April 1960, sponsored by Mrs. John F. Davidson, the widow of Commander Charles F. Brindupke, and commissioned on 9 November 1960, with Commander Richard E. Jortberg in command.|$|E
25|$|The {{submarine}} conducted regular {{operations with}} the Atlantic Fleet Submarine Force into 1974, operating off {{the east coast}} and in the Caribbean Sea. Following one Caribbean cruise {{in the fall of}} 1974, <b>Tullibee</b> departed New London on 28 April 1975 for her second deployment to the Sixth Fleet. After operating in the Mediterranean into the fall of that year, the submarine returned to New London in October {{for an extended period of}} upkeep.|$|E
25|$|In July 1964, <b>Tullibee</b> {{participated in}} fleet {{exercises}} in anti-submarine warfare (ASW) tactics with NATO units. The submarine resumed developmental work in 1965 and operated in this capacity {{into the fall}} of that year. On 28 October, her home port was temporarily changed to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, when the ship entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, for an extensive overhaul. She remained in drydock for 754 days (2 years and 24 days), emerging on 2 January 1968.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Tullibee</b> {{subsequently}} {{participated in}} sonar evaluation tests with British destroyer [...] in the Caribbean Sea {{in two separate}} deployments between April and June 1976, before undergoing another extended upkeep period. The submarine conducted ASW operations and local operations into the fall of 1976. In October 1976, the ship received the [...] "Golden Anchor" [...] Award from the Commander in Chief, U. S. Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT), for meritorious retention. She departed New London on 12 November for her third Mediterranean deployment attached to the SIXTH Fleet. <b>Tullibee</b> conducted several significant SIXTH Fleet operations and participated in key NATO exercises. Her excellence {{in the area of}} anti-submarine warfare during this patrol was acknowledged by the Commander U.S. SIXTH Fleet of the prestigious [...] "HOOK 'EM" [...] Award for ASW Excellence in the spring of 1977. She returned to her home port on 24 April 1977 and during the remainder of the year, <b>Tullibee</b> underwent three upkeep periods interspersed with ASW exercises off the east coast of the United States. The early months of 1978 were spent in preparation for her fourth Mediterranean deployment. Departing New London in March, the submarine conducted operations with various units of the Sixth Fleet. The deployment was marred somewhat by a propulsion casualty which necessitated a two-month repair period spent at Rota, Spain. <b>Tullibee</b> returned to New London on 30 August. Operations out of that port took <b>Tullibee</b> into 1979.|$|E
2500|$|Shifted back to New London, <b>Tullibee</b> {{deployed}} to the Caribbean Sea in January 1969 following refresher training and continued developmental work during 1969 and 1970. On 1 August 1970, <b>Tullibee</b> departed New London, {{bound for the}} Mediterranean and the ship's first service with the Sixth Fleet. During this period, she took part in NATO and Sixth Fleet exercises and made port visits to Athens, Greece; Naples, Italy; and Rota, Spain, before returning to New London on 14 December, having traveled some [...] in 135 days.|$|E
2500|$|During her career, <b>Tullibee</b> {{achieved}} {{much and}} conducted many submarine firsts. During her commissioned service she submerged and surfaced 730 times and traveled approximately [...] {{equal to the}} distance from the earth to the moon and halfway back.|$|E
2500|$|The Thresher {{class and}} the one-off [...] were the first with a bow-mounted sonar sphere in 1961; midships torpedo tubes angled {{outboard}} were fitted {{to make room for}} the sphere. <b>Tullibee</b> was a kind of nuclear-powered SSK; she was slow but ultra-quiet with turbo-electric drive. Her slow speed was a liability and the type was not repeated, as Thresher was faster with twice as many torpedoes, included comparable sound silencing improvements, and was commissioned only nine months later. [...] incorporated numerous advances on previous classes including an increased diving depth; her loss in April 1963 triggered a major redesign of subsequent US submarines known as the SUBSAFE program. However, Threshers general arrangement and concept were continued in all subsequent US Navy attack submarines. The first fully streamlined Soviet submarines were the Project 667A [...] "Navaga" [...] class (NATO Yankee class), Project 670 [...] "Skat" [...] class (NATO Charlie I class), and Project 671 [...] "Yorsh" [...] class (NATO Victor I class), all of which first entered service in 1967.|$|E

5000|$|This {{nuclear reactor}} {{was built in}} Windsor, Connecticut as a {{prototype}} for the experimental USS <b>Tullibee</b> (SSN-597) submarine, though that boat was in fact powered by a S2C reactor. Unusual for a nuclear submarine propulsion plant, steam turbines powered generators, which in turn powered an electric motor. This eliminated the need for reduction gears and their associated underwater noise. The USS <b>Tullibee</b> was an early advanced-design, fast-attack submarine constructed by Electric Boat and commissioned in 1960.|$|E

The enemy saw the wakes and combed the four of them as <b>Tullibee</b> was forced deep by an enemy floatplane that dropped six bombs.|$|E
50|$|On 5 March, <b>Tullibee</b> {{stood out}} of Pearl Harbor to begin her fourth war patrol. Nine days later, she called at Midway Island to top off her fuel and then {{proceeded}} to her patrol area in the Palau Islands. She was scheduled to support aircraft carrier strikes against those islands on 30-31 March. On 25 March, <b>Tullibee</b> arrived on station and began patrolling. The next day, off the Palau Islands she made radar contact on a convoy consisting of a large passenger-cargo ship, two medium-sized freighters, a destroyer, and two other escorts. The submarine made several surface runs on the transport but kept losing her in rain squalls. <b>Tullibee</b> finally closed to 3000 yd and launched two torpedoes from her bow tubes at the target. About two minutes later, the submarine was rocked by a violent explosion. It was only learned after the war that Tullibees torpedo had run a circular course and she had sunk herself.|$|E
