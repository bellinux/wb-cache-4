25|$|By {{the end of}} the 17th century, {{the first}} major defeats of the Ottoman Empire reduced the {{perceived}} threat in European minds, which led to an artistic craze for Turkish <b>things.</b> <b>There</b> was a fashion for Turkish things with Turquerie, just as there was a fashion for Chinese things with Chinoiserie, both of which became constitutive components of the Rococo style. Orientalism started to become hugely popular, first with the works of Jean-Baptiste van Mour, who had accompanied the embassy of Charles de Ferriol to Constantinople 1699 and stayed there until {{the end of his life}} in 1737, and later with the works of Boucher or Fragonard.|$|E
25|$|Phil {{begins a}} romance with Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), but Nadia returns, needing Phil {{to prove he}} is her husband to prevent deportation. She moves in with him while she is investigated. Nadia seduces and sleeps with a drunken Phil. He regrets it, denying it to Kathy so Grant threatens to kill her to make her leave but Phil later bribes her into agreeing to a divorce. Kathy agrees to marry Phil in 1994 despite {{discovering}} that he torched Frank Butcher's (Mike Reid) car lot in an insurance scam, accidentally killing a homeless boy trapped inside. Intent on winning him back, Sharon kisses Phil but he ends <b>things</b> <b>there.</b> During Phil and Kathy's engagement party, Grant listens to a cassette of Sharon admitting to the affair and plays it at the party. Kathy is incensed, and Grant beats Phil so badly {{that he has to}} go to hospital, due to a blood clot in his brain. Phil undergoes surgery, which stirs remorse in Grant. He pressures Phil into blaming Sharon for their affair and Grant forces her to leave Walford. Phil and Grant make peace but things between them are not the same.|$|E

By this time however, {{the building was}} in great disrepair; among other <b>things,</b> <b>there</b> was water damage, a collapsed wall and no structurally sound roof. The new owners planned to have summer tours for $8 in the following year, but their ultimate goal was turning the Dumas into a bed and breakfast. [...] "It needs to be around. It needs {{to be here for}} the rest of the community and the people who want to visit it," [...] said Piche. In late 2013 the duo sought a loan from the local urban revitalization body in Butte. The requested amount was $92,000 with an additional $8,750 grant. As of December 2013, tours were still being offered at the Dumas on a limited basis.|$|E
500|$|He left CAI {{at the age}} of 18 {{and began}} a degree in French at the University of Ulster, (formally Ulster Polytechnic) in Jordanstown. He stayed at {{university}} for a year before dropping out. In a 1999 interview, Nesbitt said, [...] "I had the necessary in my head, but I just couldn't be bothered. Being 18 is the worst age to expect people to learn <b>things.</b> <b>There</b> are other things to be bothered with, like girls and football." [...] He made the decision to quit when he was trying to write an overdue essay on existentialism in Les Mains Sales at 4am one day. His father suggested that he should move to England if he wanted to continue acting, so Nesbitt enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD), part of University of London. Nesbitt felt lost and misrepresented when he first arrived in London, on account of his Northern Irish background; [...] "When I first came to drama school I was a Paddy the minute I walked in. And I remember going to drama school and them all saying to me, 'Aww, yeah, Brits out', and I was like 'It's a wee bit more complicated than that, you know.'" [...] He graduated in 1987, {{at the age of}} 22.|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Bungle {{were known}} for their {{characteristically}} unconventional stage shows, where the band members would dress up in costumes and masks. In {{the early stages of}} their career they would often wear a uniform of mechanic's jumpsuits along with masks such as Madonna, Richard Nixon, Darth Vader, an executioner's hood or plastic clown or gimp masks. Bassist Trevor Dunn claimed that initially the reason for the dressing up was to assure anonymity. Regarding their heavy usage of clown and carnival themes, Trey Spruance explained [...] "The thing is, every now and then while driving around aimlessly as teenagers blasting Sodom’s Obsessed by Cruelty album at 3AM, Patton and I would run across these redneck carnivals popping-up overnight on the periphery of town, in the middle of nowhere. We called them “Satanic Carnivals” due to their unexplained phantasmic arrival, and their pointless neon lights no one was around to appreciate as they sparkled up against the dreary fog. The next night, when they'd be open, we’d actually go to these god-damned <b>things.</b> <b>There</b> was certainly a malice to the toothless meth-heads running the barely-functioning rides, and the fights that would break out among drunken loggers, but it was all pretty standard fare — no evil clowns." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cage is seen {{wearing a}} black hoodie {{throughout}} the series, which, beyond being practical for a character trying to lie low, was a nod to Trayvon Martin and Black Lives Matter. Colter said {{it was meant to}} invoke [...] "the idea that a black man in a hoodie isn’t necessarily a threat. He might just be a hero." [...] The series also features a political campaign with the slogan [...] "Keep Harlem Black", [...] "in the face of gentrification that threatens to homogenize Harlem’s cultural history." [...] Discussing these racial undertones, Coker asked, [...] "how does the presence of a bulletproof black man change the ecosystem of a neighborhood? Not just in terms of the street-level crime. How do the cops react to someone like that? What are the ripple effects of doing that? That’s one of the things I wanted to explore on the show". He added that [...] "when you’re a black superhero you can’t erase the notion that you’re black. If you’re black living in the community and you want to change <b>things,</b> <b>there</b> are going to be things that happen." [...] He did caution comparisons to recent headlines involving racial tension given when they had begun working on the show, stating that his focus had been on [...] "identity", which he saw as a common element in all black art.|$|E

2500|$|In 1977, Cruyff {{announced}} his irreversible decision {{to retire from}} international football {{at the age of}} 30, despite still lean and wiry, after helping the country qualify for the 1978 World Cup. A move which was shrouded in mystery and met with disbelief back in late 1977, was only finally stripped of its mystique in 2008, when Cruyff lifted the lid on his decision in an interview with Catalunya Radio. It was while still living in Barcelona as a player in late 1977, Cruyff and his family became the victims of an armed attacker who forced his way into his flat in Barcelona. And the man who was then the ultimate football superstar was confronted with the choice between family values and a highly promising World Cup glory {{at the end of his}} international career. But for Cruyff, family comes first. In the interview with Catalunya Radio, he said that the attempted kidnap was the reason he decided not to go to the World Cup in Argentina in 1978. As he recalled, “You should know that I had problems at the end of my career as a player here and I don't know if you know that someone [...] a rifle at my head and tied me up and tied up my wife in front of the children at our flat in Barcelona. The children were going to school accompanied by the police. The police slept in our house for three or four months. I was going to matches with a bodyguard. All these things change your point of view towards many <b>things.</b> <b>There</b> are moments in life in which there are other values. We wanted to stop this and be a little more sensible. It was the moment to leave football and I couldn't play in the World Cup after this.” ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{his first}} film was released, Buñuel {{became the first}} filmmaker to be officially welcomed {{into the ranks of}} the Surrealists by the movement's leader André Breton, an event {{recalled}} by film historian Georges Sadoul: [...] "Breton had convoked the creators to our usual venue ... one summer's evening. Dalí had the large eyes, grace, and timidity of a gazelle. [...] To us, Buñuel, big and athletic, his black eyes protruding a little, seemed exactly like he always is in Un Chien Andalou, meticulously honing the razor that will slice the open eye in two." [...] After he joined the Communist Party in Spain, however, it was quickly made clear to him that he could not be both a Communist and a Surrealist; his artistic collaborator Pierre Unik recounted in a letter of 30 January 1932 that [...] "a comrade from Agit-Prop" [...] called Buñuel and others together to tell them that, [...] "Surrealism was a movement of bourgeois degeneration", continuing, [...] "What will the rank-and-file comrades say the day I have to announce to them, 'Comrades, I no longer have the right to militate amongst you...because I'm a degenerate bourgeois?'" [...] In consequence, on 6 May 1932, Buñuel wrote a letter to André Breton renouncing his membership in the Surrealist group: [...] "Given the current state of <b>things</b> <b>there</b> could be no question for a Communist of doubting for an instant between the choice of his party and any other sort of activity or discipline". He {{even went so far as}} to try to re-issue a drastically cut version of L'Age d'Or (over two-thirds of the original were eliminated) in response to complaints that the full 60-minute original was formally too difficult for the proletariat. Nonetheless, he retained a lifelong affinity with the Surrealist movement and longstanding friendships with many of the most prominent Surrealists.|$|E
2500|$|French {{anthropologist}} Claude Lévi-Strauss's structuralist anthropology {{brought together}} ideas of Boas (especially Boas's {{belief in the}} mutability of cultural forms, and Bastian's belief in the psychic unity of humankind) and French sociologist's Émile Durkheim's focus on social structures (institutionalized relationships among persons and groups of persons). Instead of making generalizations that applied to large numbers of societies, Lévi-Strauss sought to derive from concrete cases increasingly abstract models of human nature. [...] His method begins with the supposition that culture exists in two different forms: the many distinct structures that could be inferred from observing {{members of the same}} society interact (and of which members of a society are themselves aware), and abstract structures developed by analyzing shared ways (such as myths and rituals) members of a society represent their social life (and of which members of a society are not only not consciously aware, but which moreover typically stand in opposition to, or negate, the social structures of which people are aware). [...] He then sought to develop one universal mental structure that could only be inferred through the systematic comparison of particular social and cultural structures. [...] He argued that just as there are laws through which a finite and relatively small number of chemical elements could be combined to create a seemingly infinite variety of <b>things,</b> <b>there</b> were a finite and relatively small number of cultural elements which people combine to create the great variety of cultures anthropologists observe. [...] The systematic comparison of societies would enable an anthropologist to develop this cultural [...] "table of elements," [...] and once completed, this table of cultural elements would enable an anthropologist to analyze specific cultures and achieve insights hidden to the very people who produced and lived through these cultures. [...] Structuralism came to dominate French anthropology and, in the late 1960s and 1970s, came to have great influence on American and British anthropology.|$|E
