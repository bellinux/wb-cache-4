5|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}}, or deep {{venous thrombosis}} (DVT), is {{the formation of a}} blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous <b>thromboembolism.</b> Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the American College of Physicians (ACP) {{issued a}} {{clinical}} practice guideline making three strong recommendations based on moderate-quality evidence: that hospitalized patients be assessed for {{their risk of}} <b>thromboembolism</b> and bleeding before prophylaxis is started; that heparin or a related drug be used if potential benefits are thought to outweigh potential harms; and that graduated compression stockings not be used. The ACP also drew attention {{to a lack of}} support for any performance measures encouraging physicians to apply universal prophylaxis without regard to the risks.|$|E
5|$|The drug {{strontium}} ranelate aids bone growth, increases bone density, and {{lessen the}} incidence of vertebral, peripheral, and hip fractures. However, strontium ranelate also {{increases the risk of}} venous <b>thromboembolism,</b> pulmonary embolism and serious cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction. Its use is therefore now restricted. Its beneficial effects are also questionable, since the increased bone density is partially caused by the increased density of strontium over the calcium which it replaces. Strontium also bioaccumulates in the body.|$|E
50|$|Ruplizumab (trade name Antova) is a humanized {{monoclonal}} antibody {{intended for the}} treatment of rheumatic diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus nephritis. A study showed that the drug was associated with life-threatening <b>thromboembolisms,</b> while another study only found thrombocytopenia.|$|R
50|$|In Phase II {{clinical}} trials regarding multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease, <b>thromboembolisms</b> occurred {{in at least}} three patients. A causal connection could not be proven, but since the same adverse effects were seen in trials with a similar antibody (hu5C8), the trials were halted.|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{malignancies}} have {{an increased}} risk for venous <b>thromboembolisms</b> (VTE), but data on patients with acute leukaemia are very limited so far. We found VTE in 12 % of 455 patients with acute leukaemia, half of which occurred in association with central venous catheters, with equal risk of ALL and AML...|$|R
5|$|CPAs {{have been}} {{implemented}} {{for the management of}} a plethora of chronic disease states, including diabetes mellitus, asthma, and hypertension. Evidence suggests that CPAs have resulted in beneficial health outcomes for patients involved. It has been shown that pharmacists working with providers under CPAs help deliver higher quality of care in the setting of psychiatry to promote medication adherence, managing venous <b>thromboembolism</b> in outpatient clinics, and in the oncology setting, including the management of antiemetic (anti-vomiting) therapy. Within these settings, CPAs have resulted in improved attainment of goal laboratory values like hemoglobin A1c for diabetics, improved lung function for asthmatics, and improved blood pressure control for people with hypertension.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{conditions}} associated with thrombophilia are {{deep vein thrombosis}} (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which are referred to collectively as venous <b>thromboembolism</b> (VTE). DVT usually occurs in the legs, and is characterized by pain, swelling and redness of the limb. It may lead to long-term swelling and heaviness due to damage to valves in the veins. The clot may also break off and migrate (embolize) to arteries in the lungs. Depending on the size {{and the location of}} the clot, this may lead to sudden-onset shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations and may be complicated by collapse, shock and cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|The disease term venous <b>thromboembolism</b> (VTE) {{includes}} {{the development of}} either DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE). Genetic factors that {{increase the risk of}} VTE include deficiencies of three proteins that normally prevent blood from clotting—protein C, protein S, and antithrombin—in addition to non-O blood type and mutations in the factor V and prothrombin genes. Deficiencies in antithrombin, protein C, and protein S are rare but strong, or moderately strong, risk factors. These three thrombophilia increase the risk of VTE by about 10 times. Factor V Leiden, which makes factor V resistant to inactivation by activated protein C, and the genetic variant prothrombin G20210A, which causes increased prothrombin levels, are predominantly expressed in Caucasians. They moderately increase risk for VTE, by three to eight times for factor V Leiden and two to three times for prothrombin G20210A. Having a non-O blood type roughly doubles VTE risk. Non-O blood type is common in all races, making it an important risk factor. Individuals without O blood type have higher blood levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII than those with O blood type, increasing the likelihood of clotting.|$|E
50|$|Edoxaban (DU-176b, {{trade names}} Savaysa, Lixiana) is an oral {{anticoagulant}} drug which {{acts as a}} direct factor Xa inhibitor. It was developed by Daiichi Sankyo and approved in July 2011 in Japan for prevention of venous <b>thromboembolisms</b> (VTE) following lower-limb orthopedic surgery. It was also approved by the FDA in January 2015 {{for the prevention of}} stroke and non-central-nervous-system systemic embolism.|$|R
40|$|Venous <b>thromboembolisms,</b> {{specifically}} pulmonary embolisms (PEs), {{represent a}} significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide, particularly within {{the setting of}} trauma. According to the literature, PEs {{are the most common}} cause of in-hospital death; however, this condition can be prevented with a variety of prophylactic and therapeutic measures. This article aimed to examine current evidence on the use, indications for prophylaxis, outcomes and complications of prophylactic inferior vena cava filters in trauma patients...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{suggests}} {{that patients with}} deep vein thrombosis and diabetes often have hy-per coagulable blood plasma leading to higher chances of forming <b>thromboembolisms</b> by the rupture of blood clots, which may lead to stroke and death. Despite the advances {{in the field of}} blood clot formation and lysis research, the change in mechanical properties and its impli-cation into the formation of <b>thromboembolisms</b> in platelet poor plasma is poorly understood. In this paper, we present a new computational method to simulate fibrin clot formation using molecular simulations. With an effective combination of reactive molecular dynamics con-cept and coarse graining principle, we have utilized the reactive coarse grain molecular dy-namics to predict the complex network formation of fibrin clots and the branching of the fi-brins. The heavy 340 kDa fibrinogen is converted into a simple spring-bead coarse grain sys-tem with 9 beads, and using our customized reactive potentials, we simulated the formation of the fibrin clot. Thus, formed fibrin clot agrees with the experimental results qualitatively, and to our best knowledge this is the first kind of molecular polymerization study of fibrin clot which can lead to improve our understanding about blood clot formation and its relation-ship with mechanical properties...|$|R

25|$|A {{study of}} more than 200,000 women came to the result that {{admission}} to inpatient care during pregnancy was associated with an 18-fold increase in the risk of venous <b>thromboembolism</b> (VTE) during the stay, and a 6-fold increase in risk in the four weeks after discharge, compared with pregnant women who did not require hospitalization. The study included women admitted to hospital for one or more days for reasons other than delivery or venous <b>thromboembolism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mostly {{the result}} of a <b>thrombo{{embolism}}.</b> Commonly the embolism is caused by atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, myocardial infarction, or cardiomyopathy.|$|E
50|$|P2Y12 {{belongs to}} the Gi class {{of a group of}} G protein-coupled (GPCR) purinergic receptors and is a {{chemoreceptor}} for adenosine diphosphate (ADP). This P2Y receptor family has several receptor subtypes with different pharmacological selectivity, which overlaps in some cases, for various adenosine and uridine nucleotides. The P2Y12 receptor is involved in platelet aggregation and is thus a biological target for the treatment of <b>thromboembolisms</b> and other clotting disorders. Two transcript variants encoding the same isoform have been identified for this gene.|$|R
40|$|Arterial and cardiac {{involvement}} of Behcet's {{disease is a}} rare but life threatening complication. The rupture of an arterial aneurysm might result in sudden death. We report a 54 -year-old man with an established diagnosis of Behcet's disease who presented with multiple cardiovascular complications that eventually lead to his death. He presented with extensive venous occlusions, and sequentially developed right ventricular thrombosis with multiple pulmonary <b>thromboembolisms,</b> and a pulmonary artery aneurysm. We report this unusual sequence of cardiovascular complications in a patient with Behcet's disease...|$|R
40|$|Background. Atrial {{fibrillation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common arrhythmias. There is a traditional division by time course into acute and chronic forms. The classification of acute forms is unsatisfactory. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation {{is one of the}} acute forms. There is a great variation in the frequency, duration and clinical pictures of its episodes. These can be asymptomatic or may cause significant hemodynamic disturbances, more or less unpleasant for the patients. There is growing evidence that paroxysmal atrial fibrillation could confer a hypercoagulable state, which is well known for the chronic atrial fibrillation. The possibility of thromboembolic incidents increases with the duration of an episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and is dependent on risk factors for <b>thromboembolisms.</b> Conclusions. The early cardioversion of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation into sinus rhythm is indicated when significant hemodynamic disturbances are present. Pharmacological or electrical cardioversion could be used. The early cardioversion is also recommended, as the possibility of thromboembolic incidents in the first few hours is very low. There are no firm guidelines for profilactic anticoagulation during an attack of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The decision for permanent antithrombotic therapy of patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is based on duration and frequency of episodes, on patient’s age, and risk factors for <b>thromboembolisms</b> in atrial fibrillation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} the most common {{life-threatening}} cancer diagnosed in men. Complications of prostatectomies vary and often include urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and pain, while other complications go unreported. While emergency physicians are already familiar with the more common post-operative complications presenting to their departments, including urinary retention, ileus, surgical site infections, venous <b>thromboembolisms</b> and urinary tract infections, they must have a high index of suspicion for rarer complications. We report a case of posterior bladder neck disruption as a complication of a robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy that presented to the emergency department as dysuria and abdominal pain following urination...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{six percent}} to 47 % of venous <b>thromboembolisms</b> (VTE) are {{classified}} as idiopathic. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) due to external compression of the venous system by various lesions {{has been reported in}} the literature. Identification of such lesions may obviate the need for prolonged anticoagulation and prevent recurrence. An important step in the evaluation of cases with iliofemoral thrombosis is to obtain computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis to identify any potential pathology. We report a case of acute unilateral iliofemoral DVT caused by external compression from a vesical diverticulum. The CT scan {{played a crucial role in}} the diagnosis and guided management...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Abciximab and {{tirofiban}} {{are commonly}} used {{for the treatment of}} <b>thromboembolisms</b> that form during coiling of intracranial aneurysms; however, it is not known which of these inhibitors is safer and more effective. We report the safety and the recanalization rates for intra-arterial abciximab and intra-arterial tirofiban infusion for the treatment of <b>thromboembolisms</b> that form during coiling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2004 and April 2011, 346 intracranial aneurysms were treated with coiling. Thromboembo-lisms developed in 22 of these patients and were treated by use of intra-arterial tirofiban (n 11) or abciximab (n 11) infusion. RESULTS: In the abciximab group, the thromboembolismswere completely (n 1) or partially (n 7) resolved in 8 cases (72. 7 %) {{at the time of the}} final control angiography. Complete (n 9) or partial (n 2) resolution was achieved in all cases at the time of follow-up angiography (3 days after the procedure). In the tirofiban group, thromboembolismswere completely (n 4) or partially (n 6) resolved in 10 cases (90. 9 %) at the time of the final control angiography. Complete (n 9) or partial (n 2) resolution was observed in all cases at the time of the follow-up angiography. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to thrombus resolution (final angiography, P. 311; follow-up angiography, P. 707). No hemorrhagic complications developed in either group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that tirofiban is more effective than abciximab for the immediate resolution of thromboembo-lisms, with no statistical significance. Both intra-arterial tirofiban and abciximab exhibited similar safety and recanalization rates...|$|R
25|$|An {{embolism}} is the lodging of an embolus, a blockage-causing {{piece of}} material, inside a blood vessel. The embolus {{may be a}} blood clot (thrombus), a fat globule (fat embolism), a bubble of air or other gas (gas embolism), or foreign material. An embolism can cause partial or total blockage of blood flow in the affected vessel. Such a blockage (a vascular occlusion) may affect {{a part of the}} body distant from where the embolus originated. An embolism in which the embolus is a piece of thrombus is called a <b>thromboembolism.</b> Thrombosis, the process of thrombus formation, often leads to <b>thromboembolism.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{is also an}} {{increased}} risk for cardiovascular complications, including hypertension and ischemic heart disease, and kidney disease. Other risks include stroke and venous <b>thromboembolism.</b> It seems pre-eclampsia does not {{increase the risk of}} cancer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thromboembolism</b> {{in later}} stages when the left atrial volume is {{increased}} (i.e., dilation). The latter leads to increase risk of atrial fibrillation, {{which increases the}} risk of blood stasis (motionless). This {{increases the risk of}} coagulation.|$|E
30|$|This study {{demonstrates}} {{that not only}} do fewer platelets adhere to the Sharklet micropattern, {{but there is also}} significantly less platelet activation resulting in fibrin sheath formation (Figures  3, 4). Complex fibrin networks are a clinically relevant outcome of platelet adhesion and activation, often leading to CVC occlusion or clots that cause <b>thromboembolisms</b> [14, 22]. These fibrin networks have been shown to facilitate microbial colonization and correlate with CRBSIs that occur in the clinic [20, 22, 24 - 27]. This study shows that the Sharklet micropattern can individually reduce bacterial colonization in a simulated vascular environment and reduce fibrin sheath formation that can enhance microbial colonization, thereby functioning through a dual approach to potentially limit infections.|$|R
30|$|Hemocompatibility is {{necessary}} for ECM mimics as these interact with blood directly or indirectly. The hemolysis gives the chances of RBC lysis upon contact with circulation. If hemolysis persists, it can further lead to anemia, jaundice and renal failure. A hemocompatible scaffold should be free from inducing thrombosis, <b>thromboembolisms</b> and antigenic responses (Qu et al. 2006). The obstruction in blood flow or changes in blood constituents cause the reversible aggregation of RBCs and leads to rouleaux formation. If the rouleaux persists, it will block the microcirculation too. RBC aggregation also occurs {{if there is any}} deformation in the membrane (Baskurt and Meiselman 1997). Hemocompatibility assays of both our scaffolds show their safer blood contacting application.|$|R
50|$|Few {{tamoxifen}} {{users have}} suffered from increased rates of uterine cancer, hot flushes, and <b>thromboembolisms.</b> The drug can also cause hepatocarcinomas in rats. This is likely due to the ethyl group of the tamoxifen stilbene core that is subject to allylic oxidative activation causing DNA alkylation and strand scission. This problem is later corrected in toremifene. Tamoxifen is more promiscuous than raloxifene in target sites because {{of the relationship between}} ER's amino acid in Asp-351 and the antiestrogenic side chain of the SERM. The side chain for tamoxifen cannot neutralize Asp-351, so the site allosterically influences AF-1 at the proximal end of the ER. This issue is mended with the second generation drug raloxifene.|$|R
25|$|About 90% of emboli {{are from}} {{proximal}} leg deep vein thromboses (DVTs) or pelvic vein thromboses. DVTs {{are at risk}} for dislodging and migrating to the lung circulation. The conditions are generally regarded as a continuum termed venous <b>thromboembolism</b> (VTE).|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{prosthetic}} valves {{also carry}} {{a significant increase}} in risk of <b>thromboembolism.</b> Risk varies, based on the valve type (bioprosthetic or mechanical); the position (mitral or aortic); and the presence of other factors such as AF, left-ventricular dysfunction, and previous emboli.|$|E
25|$|Pulmonary hypertension* is high {{pressure}} in the pulmonary artery. In dogs it {{can be caused by}} heartworm disease, pulmonary <b>thromboembolism,</b> or chronic hypoxemia (low oxygen). It can result in right-sided heart disease (cor pulmonale). Signs include difficulty breathing, cyanosis, and exercise intolerance.|$|E
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} is {{a common}} arrhythmic disorder which is becoming increasingly prevalent among the elderly. Atrial fibrillation is an independent risk factor for ischaemic stroke. Patients with hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, age older than 65 years, previous <b>thromboembolisms,</b> left atrial enlargement and left ventricular dysfunction have an increased risk. Coumarins (with a target international normalised ratio (INR) of 2. 0 to 3. 0) are the treatment of first choice in patients with atrial fibrillation. In young patients without additional risk factors, acetyl salicylic acid provides sufficient protection. The management of anticoagulant therapy during electric cardioversion in the acute phase of an ischaemic stroke and during elective surgical interventions, is still a subject of clinical researc...|$|R
40|$|Lasofoxifene, a new {{selective}} estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), {{was investigated}} to assess its efficacy and {{safety in the}} management of postmenopausal osteoporosis. A dose of 0. 5 mg/day of lasofoxifene, given to postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, induced a reduction in vertebral fracture rates after 3 years and a reduction, after 5 years, of nonvertebral fractures, estrogen receptor-positive and invasive breast cancers, major coronary heart diseases and strokes. However, this dose was associated with significant side effects including venous <b>thromboembolisms,</b> pulmonary embolisms, leg cramps, hot flushes, uterine polyps, endometrial hypertrophy, arthralgia and vaginal candidiasis. Since no effect was evidenced on hip fractures, the risk-benefit ratio of this new medication, compared with previously marketed SERMs is, at best, uncertain. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{capabilities}} of antithrombotic therapy to prevent thromboembolic events in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) are substantially extended after designing and clinically introducing new oral anticoagulants, {{one of which}} is dabigatran. A wealth of world clinical experience with dabigatran has confirmed its efficacy and safety provided that all recommendations for dosage regimens are followed. The universal properties of the drug can hope that the indications for its use will be extended and will not be confined to the prevention and treatment of venous and atrial thromboses and <b>thromboembolisms.</b> Whether dabigatran may be used in acute myocardial infarction and coronary stenting in the presence of nonvalvular AF, left ventricular thrombosis, and cardiomyopathies is being considered today. </p...|$|R
