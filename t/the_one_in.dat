5|$|After {{embarking on}} a small tour, the band set about {{recording}} Brave New World, their first studio album with Dickinson since 1992. Dickinson insisted that they find a replacement for the now retired Martin Birch, the band's regular producer, and record in a different studio than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> which they made No Prayer for the Dying and Fear of the Dark, to which Harris agreed. The album was recorded at Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris with producer Kevin Shirley, after which Iron Maiden undertook a supporting tour culminating with a performance at the Rock in Rio festival before a crowd of 250,000.|$|E
5|$|As {{the weather}} synoptics of the {{northern}} Pacific Ocean transitioned into a late-fall to early winter-type pattern, convection from the monsoon trough extended {{to the east of}} the International Date Line. During late November, a westerly disturbance developed into twin troughs {{on opposite sides of the}} equator; <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the Southern Hemisphere ultimately developed into Tropical Cyclone Pam, while <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the Northern Hemisphere formed into an area of convection about 2000km (1240mi) southwest of Hawaii. The disturbance gradually organized as it drifted north-northeastward, and on November 28 it developed into Tropical Depression Five-C about 465km (290mi) west-northwest of Palmyra Atoll. Operationally, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) did not begin issuing warnings on the system until December 2.|$|E

Operated by the Nebraska Department of Roads, the sensors and cameras are not used to catch speeders or for other traffic enforcement. The state also operates an extensive traffic operations center that utilizes the cameras to monitor Omaha traffic patterns.

5|$|Cerro Azul {{was quiet}} from 1846 to the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. After a possible precursor explosive event in 1903, Cerro Azul once again erupted in 1907. Between 1907 and 1914, plumes and clouds of ash frequently rose out of the caldera, and at least a few of these events were explosive. On September 8, 1914, an explosive eruption sent a plume 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4mi) into the air over 8minutes. By 1916, these eruptions had produced a caldera nearly identical to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> existence today.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Russell Boyd largely {{utilized}} available {{light to}} give the movie a natural feel, which Beresford said was crucial to its sense of authenticity. Harper said Boyd was so quiet during filming that he mostly used just three words: Yeah', 'right' and 'sure. Beresford, Foote and Duvall considered the climactic scene to be <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> which Mac, tending the family garden, discusses with Rosa Lee his pain over his daughter's death. Beresford and Boyd filmed the scene in a long take and long shot so it could flow uninterrupted, with the lonely Texas landscape captured in the background. When studio executives received the footage, they contacted Beresford and requested close-up shots be intercut, but he insisted on keeping the long take intact. Duvall said he felt the scene underscored Mac's stoicism {{in the face of}} tragedy and loss.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Franck {{moved to}} the United States, where he had {{accepted}} a professorship at Johns Hopkins University. The laboratory there was poorly equipped compared to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> Göttingen, but he received $10,000 for equipment from the Rockefeller Foundation. A more intractable {{problem was that the}} university had no money to hire skilled staff. Franck was concerned about his family members remaining in Germany, and needed money to help them emigrate. He therefore accepted an offer from the University of Chicago, where his work on photosynthesis had attracted interest, in 1938.|$|E
5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially the}} displacement of a contact line such as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the floods, the NWS utilized enhanced radar technology and computer models to better forecast flood events, {{as well as}} improved communications. Whereas in 1985, three different NWS agencies issued different warnings for the area affected in southwest Virginia, the NWS has since restructured to allow local offices, such as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> Roanoke, to directly issue watches and warnings. The NWS also implemented increased flood prediction techniques across West Virginia {{in the years after}} the floods. As many West Virginia counties lacked a full-time emergency management director at the time, funding from the NWS provided 24‑hour weather radios for every county by the year 1987.|$|E

5|$|Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow {{looked for}} effects with {{significant}} years. They asked 83 undergraduate students to rate, {{on a scale}} from 1 to 7, how much they liked the years between 1976 and 2001, the months of the year, the seasons, times of day, and even types of pet in an attempt to disguise the aim of the study. Analysis of the data showed that participants liked the year of their birth much more than the average of the four years after they were born. The researchers also found that the year of high school graduation was also liked better than average. Of the months of the year, the most liked month was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> which the participants were born.|$|E
5|$|Serjeant's Inn was an Inn of Court {{restricted}} to Serjeants-at-Law. It operated from three locations, one in Holborn, known as Scroope's Inn, which was abandoned by 1498 for <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> Fleet Street, which was pulled down during the 18th century, {{and one on}} Chancery Lane, pulled down in 1877. The Inn was a voluntary association, and although most Serjeants joined upon being appointed they were not required to. There were rarely more than 40 Serjeants, even including members of the judiciary, and the Inns were noticeably smaller than the Inns of Court. Unlike the Inns of Court, Serjeant's Inn was a private establishment similar to a gentlemen's club.|$|E

The Democrats' hopes were buoyed when Robert M. La Follette Sr., a Republican senator from Wisconsin, split from the GOP {{to form a new}} Progressive Party. Many believed that the split in the Republican party, like <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> 1912, would allow a Democrat to win the presidency.|$|E
5|$|The breed was {{originally}} a multipurpose horse, used for agriculture, cavalry and pulling diligences (a type of carriage). Because {{of a lack}} of support from a breeding syndicate, such as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> existence for the Mérens horse, once the need for a multipurpose breed declined, the population of the Castillonnais dwindled. Many horses were crossbred with draft horses, and the breed almost became extinct. The intervention of a group of supporters in 1980 saved the breed from extinction, and in 1992 L'Association Pyrénéenne Ariégeoise du Cheval Castillonnais (the Ariege Pyrenees Association of Castillonnais Horses) was formed, with support from several French government agencies and stud farms. Annually, in August, the association holds a small competition and sale for the breed in Castillon-en-Couserans, which also includes inspections to register horses for the breed studbook.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} of current-day Route31 began around1916, when {{a portion of}} the highway, along the community of Hampton was taken over by the state and was repaired to state standards for $300 (1916USD). In1923, the state of New Jersey passed the Good Roads Act, which greatly expanded the state highway system in New Jersey. This act took over pre-existing highways and rebuilt them to a standard mandated by the state. Construction began on Route31 in1926, when the State Highway Department began work at the southern terminus in Trenton. A total of11 bridges were constructed along the highway during this time, signifying the route's construction northward. The oldest ones, dating back to1926, were located in Ewing Township and Oxford Township. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> Ewing Township was along the first portion of the highway to be constructed.|$|E
