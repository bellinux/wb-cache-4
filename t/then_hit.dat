5|$|As a batsman, Miller was out {{for four}} in the first innings, not {{offering}} a shot to an inswinger. In the second innings, Miller's first ball was a hat-trick ball from English captain Norman Yardley; he survived a loud leg before wicket appeal and <b>then</b> <b>hit</b> a six into the grandstand, {{on his way to}} 74. Australia declared at 7/460, 595runs ahead. Miller took three catches as Australia won by 409runs.|$|E
5|$|Chad Durbin {{relieved}} Happ {{in the top}} of the seventh. He walked Johnny Damon, {{who then}} stole second base. Rodriguez was <b>then</b> <b>hit</b> by a pitch, and Damon scored on a single by Jorge Posada. Joba Chamberlain relieved Pettitte in the bottom of the seventh and retired the side in order. Brett Myers retired the first two batters {{in the top of}} the eighth, but Hideki Matsui <b>then</b> <b>hit</b> a solo home run pinch hitting for Chamberlain. Phil Hughes pitched a third of an inning in the bottom of the ninth and allowed a solo home run to Carlos Ruiz before being relieved by Mariano Rivera. Rivera closed out the game, throwing just five pitches to record the final two outs. This game was Pettitte's 17th career postseason win, extending his MLB record.|$|E
5|$|Next, The New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn) and Kane faced The Shield (Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns). The pace of {{the match}} was quick; {{the end of the}} match saw Kane being hit by Reigns' {{signature}} spear, and Reigns <b>then</b> <b>hit</b> both Outlaws simultaneously with another spear. The Shield then performed their Triple Powerbomb maneuver on both Outlaws for a decisive victory.|$|E

5|$|The First Test at Trent Bridge {{was washed}} out, with England scoring 0/32 {{in the only}} innings of the match. Macartney then scored 54 as Australia made 6/148 in the only innings of another wet match against Yorkshire. He <b>then</b> <b>hit</b> form ahead of the Second Test, scoring 160 and taking a total of 5/34 in an innings win over Lancashire.|$|E
5|$|Another catch {{went down}} off Miller {{late in the}} day when Compton, who had reached a century, edged him but Johnson dropped the catch at slip. Charlie Barnett then edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller {{completed}} a difficult catch. Compton <b>then</b> <b>hit</b> Miller for four, provoking the paceman's first bouncer of the day. Compton hooked it away for two and the next delivery slipped out of Miller's hand and cleared the batsman's head on the full, provoking some jeering in the crowd. England reached stumps at 6/345, just one run ahead of the tourists, with Compton on 154.|$|E
5|$|At {{about this}} time, Nasu's left wing battalions {{finally began to}} reach the Marine defenses. At 00:30 on 25 October, the 11th Company of Nasu's 3rd Battalion under Captain Jiro Katsumata found and {{attacked}} Company A of Puller's battalion. Katsumata's attack was impeded by heavy barbed wire {{in front of the}} Marine line and <b>then</b> <b>hit</b> heavily by American machine gun, mortar, and artillery fire. By 01:00, the Marine fire had killed most of Katsumata's company.|$|E

Carlito pinned Benjamin with a roll-up, allowing Carlito to retain the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|Boycott {{began his}} Test career on 4 June 1964, {{only two years}} after his {{first-class}} debut, in the first Test against Australia. He top scored with 48 runs from 118 deliveries before he was bowled by Grahame Corling. The match ended as a rain-affected draw, and Boycott did not bat in the second innings as he had suffered a cracked finger. He made 58 at Old Trafford, and <b>then</b> <b>hit</b> 113 at The Oval, his maiden Test century. He finished his first Test series with 291 runs at 48.50.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the third}} day, Lindwall bowled Edrich for 28, before Compton and Hutton {{consolidated}} the innings with a partnership of 61 in 110 minutes. On 39, Compton fell to a reflex catch by Lindwall. Hutton managed to continue resisting before edging Miller to Tallon for 64, having top-scored in both innings, to leave England at 153/4. Thereafter, England collapsed in the fading light, prompting the umpires to call off play. The ground was <b>then</b> <b>hit</b> by rain, resulting in a premature end to the day's play. England had lost four wickets for 25 runs to end at 178/7.|$|E

American League MVP Lou Boudreau <b>then</b> <b>hit</b> a solo home run off Galehouse to make the score 1–0. After another out, Bearden came on the mound {{in the bottom of}} the first. Johnny Pesky doubled, then scored on a hit by Vern Stephens to make the score 1–1 at the end of the first inning. Both {{pitchers}} allowed one baserunner the following inning; Ken Keltner reached base for Cleveland and Birdie Tebbetts reached base for the Red Sox. Both pitchers then got three quick outs in the third inning.|$|E
5|$|Hutton then edged a {{ball from}} left-arm medium pacer Ernie Toshack through the slips, and was dropped by Lindsay Hassett on 25 after {{flicking}} the ball behind square leg from the medium pace of Sam Loxton. Hutton <b>then</b> <b>hit</b> a square drive past point and Washbrook pulled a ball {{along the ground}} past Harvey, who was patrolling the midwicket boundary. England were 88 without loss at the lunch interval, with Hutton and Washbrook on 46 and 41 respectively. After a slow start, they had scored at almost a run a minute after passing 50, and five boundaries were hit from a spell of six overs by Lindwall.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} match, Cesaro {{defeated}} Sami Zayn. In {{the first half}} of the match, Zayn dove through the ropes looking for a tornado DDT, only for Cesaro to intercept with a European uppercut. Cesaro went on to target Zayn's left knee. In the second half of the match, Cesaro attempted to superplex Zayn from the apron into the ring, but Zayn countered and tried to perform a frankensteiner to Cesaro. Cesaro countered to try a superbomb, but Zayn reversed to successfully perform the frankensteiner. Zayn <b>then</b> <b>hit</b> his signature Helluva Kick to Cesaro, but Cesaro kicked out of the resulting pin. Cesaro then repeatedly implored Zayn to stay down, but Zayn kept getting up to receive more European uppercuts. Cesaro attempted his signature Neutralizer, but Zayn countered and went on to hit a sunset flip powerbomb, but it was not enough to win the match. Cesaro <b>then</b> <b>hit</b> a European uppercut after throwing Zayn into the air, but Zayn kicked out of a pin at one. Cesaro hit a discus European uppercut and then performed the Neutralizer on Zayn for the victory. After the match, Cesaro hugged Zayn.|$|E

Luis Sojo {{followed}} with a double to right field that glanced off of first baseman J. T. Snow's glove and rolled under the Angels' bullpen bench, scoring Blowers, Martinez, and Cora. Sojo himself scored on the play {{as a result of}} Langston's throwing error, and Langston was replaced by relief pitcher Bob Patterson.|$|E
5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of August 1915, Sing was hospitalised for four days with influenza. That same month, an enemy sniper's bullet struck Sheehan's spotting telescope, injuring his hands and face, and <b>then</b> <b>hit</b> Sing's shoulder, but the latter was back in action after a week's recuperation. Sheehan was more severely wounded, and was shipped back to Australia. This was reportedly {{the only time that}} Sing was injured at Gallipoli. He would not fare so well later on in the war.|$|E
5|$|On August 18 at AT Park, in a 10-7 {{win over}} the New York Mets, Bumgarner became the second pitcher {{in the modern era}} after Hal Jeffcoat of the 1957 Cincinnati Redlegs to allow a grand slam and <b>then</b> <b>hit</b> a go-ahead home run in the same inning, {{according}} to the Elias Sports Bureau.

5|$|Once again, the Red Sox {{took the}} lead in the first inning when Ramírez hit a home run off former Red Sox pitcher Jeff Suppan. Martínez was the {{starting}} pitcher for the Red Sox, and {{in the bottom of the}} first inning, he allowed the Cardinals to load the bases with one out. Edmonds <b>then</b> <b>hit</b> a fly ball towards Ramírez in left field, who caught it on the run and threw to catcher Jason Varitek at home plate. Varitek tagged out Walker, who was attempting to score from third, ending the inning.|$|E
5|$|Phillies starter Pedro Martínez {{was removed}} after {{allowing}} four runs in four innings, relieved {{in the fifth}} by Chad Durbin. Durbin allowed a ground rule double to Jeter, who advanced to third on a sacrifice bunt by Hairston and scored on a single by Mark Teixeira. Durbin <b>then</b> <b>hit</b> Rodriguez with a pitch and was relieved by J.A. Happ after recording just one out. Happ allowed a two-run double to Matsui, his fifth and sixth RBI of the game, which tied a World Series record for most RBI in a single game set by Bobby Richardson in the 1960 World Series.|$|E
5|$|Red Sox closer Foulke came in {{to pitch}} {{the bottom of the}} ninth. Pujols led off the inning by hitting a single through Foulke's legs and into center field. After Foulke induced Rolen into a fly out and struck out Edmonds, Pujols took second base, but no stolen base due to fielder's indifference. Édgar Rentería <b>then</b> <b>hit</b> a ground ball that bounced back to Foulke on the mound. Foulke threw it underhand to Doug Mientkiewicz at first base to end the game, and secure the series.|$|E
5000|$|There is no universally {{accepted}} symbol for a single. Most often, singles are not reported; rather, {{the total number}} of hits, doubles, triples, and home runs is reported; <b>then,</b> <b>hits</b> minus these [...] "extra base hits" [...] yields the number of singles.|$|R
