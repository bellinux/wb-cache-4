5|$|After {{the riders}} left Huy, Team Sky came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the peloton with Peter Kennaugh; his riding {{at the front}} of the bunch reduced the gap to under five minutes. Honig and Teunissen were dropped from the leading group on the second climb of the Côte de Bellaire. Katusha and Movistar were joined {{at the front of}} the peloton by Etixx-Quick Step as the race {{returned}} towards Huy.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Whitlock et al. {{described}} a juvenile skull {{at the time}} referred to Diplodocus (CM11255) that differed greatly from adult skulls of the same genus: its snout was not blunt, and the teeth were not confined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the snout. These differences suggest that adults and juveniles were feeding differently. Such an ecological difference between adults and juveniles had not been previously observed in sauropodomorphs.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{for the new}} chapel {{were drawn}} up by J.H.Perkins, a local school master, with seating for 2,500. In 1859 a {{colonnade}} was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the chapel, with a window and cornice above. This was designed by Staffordshire architect Robert Scrivener. Further alterations were made in 1887, including {{the extension of the}} minister's vestry, replacement of the windows and renewal and restoration of the pews.|$|E

The main building is an unusual design based on curves and circles.

5|$|The Algonquin Round Table, {{as well as}} {{the number}} of other {{literary}} and theatrical greats who lodged there, helped earn the hotel its status as a New York City Historic Landmark. The hotel was so designated in 1987. In 1996 the hotel was designated a National Literary Landmark by the Friends of Libraries USA. The organization's bronze plaque is attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the hotel.|$|E

5|$|The {{name was}} taken from the Palace of Whitehall that was the {{residence}} of Kings Henry VIII through to William III, before its destruction by fire in 1698; only the Banqueting House survived. Whitehall was originally a wide road that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the palace; the route to the south was widened in the 18th century following the destruction of the palace.|$|E
5|$|The {{pre-production}} Griffon I {{shared the}} R engine's bore and stroke, but was otherwise {{a completely new}} design that first ran in the Experimental Department in November 1939. Although this single engine was never flown, the production version, the Griffon II, first flew in 1941 installed in the Fairey Firefly. A {{significant difference between the}} R and the production Griffon was the re-location of the camshaft and supercharger drives <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the engine to reduce overall length. Another length-reducing measure was the use of a single magneto (the R had two, mounted at the rear), this again was moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the engine.|$|E
5|$|The sperm whale's unique body is {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other species. The sperm whale's distinctive shape comes from its very large, block-shaped head, which can be one-quarter to one-third of the animal's length. The S-shaped blowhole is located very close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the head and shifted to the whale's left. This gives rise to a distinctive bushy, forward-angled spray.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} after {{starting}} work on the canal, the Member had an artificial lake built on a flat piece of land <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the mansion house. The landscape gardener William S Gilpin was carrying out work on the adjacent Strichen estate {{at about the same}} time, and it is assumed he gave help with the work at Pitfour. The lake extends to almost 50 acres and was based on the artificial lake at Windsor Great Park.|$|E
5|$|After {{offering}} his commiserations to Manchester United's players, Joan Laporta then joined the Barcelona team {{to lead them}} up the podium, closely followed by manager Guardiola. Laporta himself collected Barcelona's commemorative plaque before accepting a medal from Platini. Once the entire Barcelona team had collected their medals, Platini made his way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the podium to present Carles Puyol with the European Champion Clubs' Cup. The Barcelona captain promptly held the trophy aloft with accompaniment from the UEFA Champions League Anthem and explosions of golden confetti, before leading his team on a lap of honour.|$|E

5|$|Architect Carl Frederik Stanley (1769–1805), {{educated in}} Copenhagen, spent some years in Norway {{around the turn}} of the 19th century. He did minor works for wealthy patrons in and around Oslo, but his major {{achievement}} was the renovation of the only seat of higher education in Christiania, the Oslo Katedralskole, completed in 1800. He added a classical portico <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> an older structure, and a semi-circular auditorium that was sequestered by Parliament in 1814 as a temporary place to assemble, now preserved at Norsk Folkemuseum as a national monument.|$|E
5|$|Architects and conservationists {{argued that}} the pier was architecturally {{significant}} to Hong Kong {{as one of the}} last remaining examples of a Streamline Moderne public building (along with the Central Market and Wan Chai Market which have been earmarked for demolition); culturally the pier was widely recognised as a part of local collective memory. The Hong Kong Institute of Architects warned against the destruction of Hong Kong's heritage, saying it would be an irreversible mistake. Public opinion has resulted in alternatives put forward to preserve the clock tower, including moving the proposed six-lane road or relocating the clock tower <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the new pier as a memorial.|$|E
5|$|Around the 33rd day of development, the vesicles {{begin to}} {{differentiate}}. Closer {{to the back}} of the embryo, they form what will become the utricle and semicircular canals. Closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the embryo, the vesicles differentiate into a rudimentary saccule, which will eventually become the saccule and cochlea. Part of the saccule will eventually give rise and connect to the cochlear duct. This duct appears approximately during the sixth week and connects to the saccule through the ductus reuniens.|$|E

5|$|As the Mk. XIV could {{calculate}} {{the effects of}} a shallow climb or dive (or glide as it is referred to in bombing), the computor included its own levelling mechanism. This was added to the range angle calculated by the computor to move the sight head. Levelling the system required adjustment of both the computor and the sight head. Since these were in a fixed relationship to each other, levelling could be carried out on the ground and then left alone. Any adjustments required were recorded on a card fixed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the computor.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s Tywyn Wharf station was {{in need of}} major improvements. Before preservation, the station had {{contained}} only a fan of sidings, which meant {{that there was no way}} for the locomotive of an arriving train to run round the carriages. As a result, trains were pushed from behind as far as Pendre, where the locomotive could be moved past the carriages <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the train. A loop was installed at Wharf for the first time in August 1952, to avoid having to propel trains to Pendre, but in the winter of 1964/65 a major upgrade of the station was carried out. This improved the track layout and extended the original office building to provide covered accommodation for passengers and a shop.|$|E
