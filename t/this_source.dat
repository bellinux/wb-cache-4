5|$|The Confederate {{government}} {{also tried to}} raise revenue through unorthodox means. Early on (in {{the first half of}} 1861), when the support for the separation from the Union and the military effort was running strong, the donation of coins and gold to the government accounted for about 35% of all sources of government funds. <b>This</b> <b>source,</b> however, dried up over time as individuals and institutions in the South both ran down their personal holdings of bullion and became more unwilling to make donations as war-weariness set in. As a consequence, by the summer of 1862, the share of government revenue coming from these donations fell to less than 1%. Over the course of the entire war <b>this</b> <b>source</b> of revenue contributed only 0.2% of total wartime expenditure.|$|E
5|$|The {{year and}} {{circumstances}} of Ragnall's death are uncertain, as surviving contemporary sources failed to mark his demise. According to clan tradition {{preserved in the}} Book of Clanranald, Ragnall may have died in 1207. However, no corroborating evidence supports this date, and {{there is reason to}} believe that dates in <b>this</b> <b>source</b> are unreliable. In fact, <b>this</b> <b>source</b> misplaces Somairle's death by sixteen years, which may indicate that Ragnall himself died some sixteen years earlier (in 1191). If this date is correct then Ragnall's death may be related to his defeat suffered at the hands of his brother. However, the Chronicle of Mann, which records the 1192 conflict between Ragnall and Áengus, gives no hint of Ragnall's demise in its account. Another possibility is that Ragnall may have been slain sometime around 1209 and 1210, during yet more internal conflict amongst the meic Somairle.|$|E

5|$|According to the thirteenth-century Historia Gruffud vab Kenan, {{the mother}} of Cynan's son was Ragnailt ingen Amlaíb, a {{paternal}} granddaughter of Sitriuc. Further revealed by <b>this</b> <b>source</b> {{is the fact that}} this woman's father, Amlaíb mac Sitriuc, built and commanded a Welsh fortress called Castell Avloed. Although it is unknown how long the Dubliners possessed the fortress, in 1036 another son of Sitriuc was slain in Wales by an apparent kinsman, an event which could be evidence of a struggle for control of the site. Echmarcach's aforesaid expulsion of Sitriuc from Dublin in the same year could in turn indicate that this exiled monarch sought refuge in Wales.|$|E
5|$|Another likely {{literary}} {{source is}} the plague narrative in the Book of Exodus, in which Egypt {{is covered by}} darkness for three days.

5|$|Another {{narrative}} on the constellations, three paragraphs long, {{is from a}} Latin writer whose brief notes {{have come}} down to us {{under the name of}} Hyginus.

5|$|Domnall was {{a son of}} Tadc (died 1086), son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster (died 1086). Domnall was, therefore, {{a member}} of the Meic Taidc. According to the twelfth-century Banshenchas, Domnall's father married Mór, {{daughter}} of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles (died 1064/1065). <b>This</b> <b>source</b> specifies that the couple had three sons and a daughter: Amlaíb (died 1096), Bé Binn, Donnchad (died 1113), and Domnall himself.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, a {{prominent}} radio source was identified overlapping {{the location of}} M87, and this was labeled Virgo-A. <b>This</b> <b>source</b> was confirmed to be M87 by 1953, and the linear relativistic jet emerging from {{the core of the}} galaxy was suggested as the cause. This jet extended from the core at a position angle of 260° to an angular distance of 20″ with an angular width of 2″. In 1969–70, a strong component of the radio emission was found to closely align with the optical source of the jet.|$|E
5|$|Later {{commenting on}} <b>this</b> <b>source,</b> Maylam {{highlighted}} that its author {{did not appear}} to be from Kent and that, from their use of wording, it appeared that they had been told about the tradition by locals but had not actually witnessed it first hand. As such, Maylam suggested that the author may have been wrong in describing the use of a horse's skull in the Ramsgate tradition, given that both later sources and the hoodeners of his own time all used a wooden model of a horse's head. At the same time, Maylam noted that the use of a horse's skull was not impossible, for such skulls had also been used in the hobby horse traditions of other parts of Britain.|$|E

5|$|The {{aforesaid}} {{kings of}} Bǫglunga sǫgur most likely refer to Rǫgnvaldr and his son, Guðrøðr (died 1231), {{although it is}} not impossible that the king 'Rǫgnvaldr' in <b>this</b> <b>source</b> may instead refer to Ragnall, and that the king 'Guðrøðr' in it may actually refer to Rǫgnvaldr himself, since the latter's father was named Guðrøðr. Whatever the case, the events depicted in Bǫglunga sǫgur appear to show that, in the wake of destructive Norwegian activity in the Isles, which may have been some sort of officially sanctioned punishment from Scandinavia, Rǫgnvaldr and his son (or instead perhaps Ragnall and Rǫgnvaldr) travelled to Norway where they rendered homage to the Norwegian king, and made compensation for unpaid taxes.|$|E
