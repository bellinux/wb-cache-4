The rail route through Adelaide's far south is off-centre, without the large catchment area of a more central transport route.

5|$|After the Great Depression, the {{maintenance}} of the tramway system and the purchase of new trams suffered. Competition from private buses, the MTT's own bus fleet and the growth of private car ownership all took patrons from the tram network. By the 1950s, the tram network was losing money and being replaced by an electric and petrol-driven bus fleet. Adelaide's tram history is preserved by the volunteer-run Tramway Museum, St Kilda and <b>the</b> <b>continuing</b> use of 1929 H type trams on the remaining Glenelg tram line.|$|E
