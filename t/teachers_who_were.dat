By age 15, her mother and ballet <b>teachers,</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> serving as her custodial guardians, fought a custody battle over her. Meanwhile, Copeland, who was already an award-winning dancer, was fielding professional offers. The 1998 legal issues involved filings for emancipation by Copeland and restraining orders by her mother. Both sides dropped legal proceedings, and Copeland moved home to begin studying under a new teacher who was a former ABT member.|$|E

The 1912 Olympic pentathlon and decathlon champion Jim Thorpe was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds. Swiss and Austrian skiers boycotted the 1936 Winter Olympics in support of their skiing <b>teachers,</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not allowed to compete because they earned money with their sport and were thus considered professionals.|$|E
5|$|Three Jesuits were sent- P. Hebrans in 1895 and P. Hoevanaars and Frans van Lith (1863-1926) in 1896. The three studied Javanese in Gedangan over {{a period}} of a year.

Furthermore, in 1904 he spearheaded a mass baptism at Kalibawang, Kulon Progo, near Yogyakarta. A total of 168 Javanese were baptised. Van Lith's efforts eventually returned to Semarang, where he established a Kanisius school in the parish of Gedangan in 1924.|$|E

25|$|Francisc Rainer was {{a native}} of Rohozna town, near Czernowitz, in Austrian-controlled Bukovina. His parents were Lutheran, but baptized their son Roman Catholic. His father, Gustav Adolf Ignatz Rainer, emigrated to the Romanian Old Kingdom as an {{employee}} of the Strusberg Company that built the Bucharest-Giurgiu railway, the country's first. Remaining there, he obtained a post in the administration of Căile Ferate Române. His mother Maria (or Ana) came from a clerical family, and was a housewife. The boy received his primary education at home from his parents, later attending Saint Sava National College. Among the <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> particularly helpful was Sabba Ștefănescu in natural sciences. Rainer read extensively, teaching himself Latin and Ancient Greek, and becoming passionate about the literary works of Goethe and the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. He slowly discarded the latter's influence when he discovered Heraclitus, Ernst Haeckel, and classical materialistic thought. Such works diverted him from his original goal of becoming a Catholic missionary.|$|E
25|$|Schools in Newfoundland, {{especially}} in outport settlements, faced many problems and obstacles. The {{success of the}} schools {{was influenced by the}} conditions within the settlement, and these conditions often affected student attendance, payments, learning, and so forth. For example, conditions which affected the population were such things as illnesses (or epidemics) such as the flu, fever, whooping cough, smallpox, measles, etc. The weather also posed problems, severe snowstorms in the winter months often closed schools for days; and if the weather was too cold, children could not make it to school or could not keep the school in fuel for heat. The fishery affected the school and its attendance greatly. During the fishing season, children were often needed to help out in the fishery and could not attend school. Also, in smaller settlements, the teacher was allowed to attend the fishery in order to supplement their low teaching salaries; therefore, closing the school during that season. A failure in the fishery also had severe consequences as parents could not pay subscriptions to the school. Poverty also led to a lack of clothes and shoes which meant children could not be sent to school. The N.S.S., unlike other schools, tried their best to counter these obstacles. For example, the N.S.S. would send shipments of clothes and shoes from England to Newfoundland to give to poverty-stricken families so their children could continue to attend school. Also, other schools in Newfoundland had trouble procuring and paying qualified teachers. The N.S.S., however, were able to recruite qualified <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> trained at the National School Society Training School in England {{and they were able to}} pay their teachers better salaries.|$|E

500|$|By September 1948, the Red Scare {{began to}} take hold, and Conant called for a ban on hiring <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> communists, {{although}} not for the dismissal {{of those who had}} already been hired. A debate ensued over whether communist educators could teach apolitical subjects. Conant {{was a member of the}} Educational Policies Commission (EPC), a body to which he had been appointed in 1941. When it next met in March 1949, Conant's push for a ban was supported by the president of Columbia University, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower. The two found common ground in their belief in ideology-based education, which Conant called [...] "democratic education". He did not see public education as a side effect of American democracy, but as one of its principal driving forces, and he disapproved of the public funding of denominational schools that he observed in Australia during his visit there in 1951. He called for increased federal spending on education, and higher taxes to redistribute wealth. His thinking was outlined in his books Education in a Divided World in 1948, and Education and Liberty in 1951. In 1952, he went further and endorsed the dismissal of academics who invoked the Fifth under questioning by the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Novi list, Blažeković stated that all work at the University of Zagreb would be [...] "in harmony with the new Ustaša spirit... with which youth had been imbued for years in the decades when the university was the [...] "battleground" [...] of the Croatian struggle for liberation." [...] He {{went on to say}} that the first priority of the USS was to be the social welfare of students and the expansion of student dining rooms and residential halls. He declared that the structure of the university would change to conform with Ustaše principles – each faculty would have its own camp, consisting of a camp leader and seven adjutants responsible for military training, socio-economic welfare, contacts, sports, professional training, education and journals. Blažeković explained that for the first year of academic study, the university would employ [...] "veteran warriors" [...] as <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> to be replaced by fully trained [...] "younger forces" [...] who had spent the previous year preparing for their new roles. Furthermore, he stated that student volunteers would collaborate in the creation and popularization of the USS and other Ustaše organizations, which, once they had established themselves in university life, were to establish a professional, non-ideological student organization meant to incorporate all Croatian students. When asked if Serbs and Jews were to be permitted to attend universities in the NDH, Blažeković replied: [...] "In the coming academic year, the university will be swept clean of foreigners hostile to Croatians and the Ustaše movement, and in this way our endeavours at the university will be made easier." [...] Later, while dining with the wife of a Swedish diplomat, Blažeković boasted of the large number of Serbs he had killed, claiming that he placed the ears of murdered Serbs on a necklace worn over his smoking jacket.|$|E
