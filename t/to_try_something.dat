5|$|Castellaneta started acting {{after his}} {{graduation}} from Northern Illinois University in 1979. He {{decided that if}} his career went nowhere he would {{still have a chance}} <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>something</b> else. He began taking improvisation classes, where he met his future wife Deb Lacusta. Castellaneta started to work at The Second City, an improvisational theatre in Chicago, in 1983 and continued to work there until 1987. During this period, he did voice-over work with his wife for various radio stations. He auditioned for a role in The Tracey Ullman Show and his first meeting underwhelmed Tracey Ullman and the other producers. Ullman decided to fly to Chicago to watch Castellaneta perform. His performance that night was about a blind man who tries to become a comedian and Ullman later recalled that although there were flashier performances that night, Castellaneta made her cry. She was impressed and Castellaneta was hired.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. In {{the background of the}} classroom, there are several portraits of past United States presidents. These were added for the scene where Bart tries to think of a name for his fictional letter writer, and sees a portrait of Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow's voice was performed by Harry Shearer, who did an impression of Ricardo Montalbán. The picture Bart sends Edna is of NHL and WHA star Gordie Howe. The writers had originally wanted to use a picture of American football player Johnny Unitas, but were unable to get the rights to use his image for free. Howe, their second choice, was suggested by Al Jean, who had been a Detroit Red Wings fan growing up. At the end of the episode, Howe's NHL and WHA statistics are shown because the writers decided <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>something</b> different in filling a slight time under-run.|$|E
5|$|Homer and {{his wife}} Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is a crude, bald, obese, short-tempered, neglectful of the rules, clumsy, lazy, heavy drinking, ignorant and idiotic person; however, he is {{essentially}} a decent man and fiercely devoted to his family, often ignoring his own personal interests for those of his family. Examples include working long hours in order to buy Lisa a horse, dealing with Marge's sisters when they come over, moving back to Springfield instead of staying in a job he loves, getting Bart a ride back to Springfield after getting stranded during spring break, going to Lisa's band concerts, and giving up his love of pork chop night {{in order to take}} his family out on town <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>something</b> they like. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, making a movie with Mel Gibson, fighting President George H. W. Bush, fighting in professional boxing and earning a shot at the heavyweight title, and winning a Grammy Award.|$|E

5|$|Owner Hugh Culverhouse, {{encouraged}} by recommendations from Vice President of Operations Ron Wolf and Alabama coaching legend Bear Bryant, chose John McKay, winner of four national championships with the USC Trojans, {{as the first}} Buccaneer head coach. Aided by a string of great tailbacks, including Heisman Trophy winners O. J. Simpson and Mike Garrett, McKay was credited with popularizing the I formation. Other candidates considered included Hank Stram, Ara Parseghian, and Joe Paterno. McKay was reportedly offered a five-year contract worth $750,000, plus cars, insurance, and real estate, and turned down an offer from the Seattle Seahawks and a counter-offer from USC to take the job. Critical of the NFL, he had turned down offers from professional teams in the past. McKay cited NCAA cutbacks in finances and recruiting as motivations for leaving the college ranks, saying simply that it was “time <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>something</b> else”. McKay’s only promise {{was that he would}} beat what he called “Pittsburgh’s timetable”, referencing the fact that it took the Steelers 41 years to win their first championship. Coach McKay would prove to be somewhat correct as Tampa Bay won the NFC's Central Division in 1979, the team's fourth year of existence, though it would take the team 27 seasons to win its first championship, which occurred in the 2002 season.|$|E

25|$|After {{the success}} of Chocolat, Binoche was internationally {{recognized}} as an A-list movie star in the early 2000s, but as an actor her persona became somewhat fixed following a series of period roles portraying a stoic heroine facing tragedy and desolation. Keen <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>something</b> new, Binoche returned to French cinema in 2002 in an unlikely role: she played a ditsy beautician in Jet Lag opposite Jean Reno. The film, directed by Daniele Thompson, was a box-office hit in France and Binoche was once again nominated for a César for Best Actress. The film {{tells the story of}} a couple who meet at an airport during a strike. Initially the pair despises each other, but, over the course of one night, they find common ground and maybe even love. This playful spirit continued when Binoche featured in a 2003 Italian television commercial for the chocolates Ferrero Rocher. The advertisement played upon her Chocolat persona featuring Binoche handing out the chocolates to people on the streets of Paris.|$|E

25|$|Often, {{people with}} dysthymia will seek out {{treatment}} not necessarily because of depressed mood, but rather due to increasing {{levels of stress}} or because of personal difficulties that may be situation-related. This is hypothesized to be because of the chronic nature of the disorder, and how depressed mood is often {{thought to be a}} characterological pattern for the individual with the condition. Thus, it is only when the person experiences increasing stress that he or she thinks to go to some sort of trained professional for symptom relief. It is usually through the administration of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV that dysthymia is first diagnosed. At this point, {{with the help of a}} trained professional, a certain line of treatment is often discussed and then selected. It is important to consider all factors in the person's life that may be affected when deciding on a particular course of treatment. Additionally, if one method of treatment does not particularly work for a certain individual, it may be helpful <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>something</b> else.|$|E

500|$|... "Moaning Lisa" [...] was {{the first}} episode of the series to focus on Lisa. The idea for it was {{suggested}} by The Simpsons producer James L. Brooks, who wanted to do an episode where Lisa was sad {{but she did not}} know why. The writers also felt that they had done several [...] "jokey" [...] episodes on the show and wanted <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>something</b> new that was [...] "really emotional and sweet". The song Lisa sings in this episode later reappeared in expanded form on The Simpsons Sing the Blues CD.|$|E

It is also his first series to be published through Image Comics, whom he selected as the series' publisher {{on the recommendation of}} writer Jay Faerber, who cited the creative freedom afforded by that publisher.

500|$|In hindsight, {{the team}} {{considered}} {{the story of}} Far Cry 3 [...] "great", even though they {{thought that it was}} separated from the game's world. In order to increase players' agency and make the story to feel more connected to the world for players, the team introduced a branching storyline which required players to make choices that would lead to different results and alter the game's ending. The team hoped that by adding choices, they could add additional depth and meaning to the game's campaign. Thompson added that they twisted the story of Far Cry 3 for Far Cry 4, and made outsiders the villains instead of the heroes. The team considered it a [...] "risk", but they wanted <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>something</b> different.|$|E

500|$|The 1950s saw Hepburn take on {{a series}} of {{professional}} challenges, and stretch herself further than at any other point in her life at an age when most other actresses began to retreat. Berg describes the decade as [...] "the heart of her vast legacy" [...] and [...] "the period in which she truly came into her own." [...] In January 1950, Hepburn ventured into Shakespeare, playing Rosalind in As You Like It. She hoped to prove that she could play already established material, and said, [...] "It's better <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>something</b> difficult and flop than to play it safe all the time." [...] It opened at the Cort Theatre in New York to a capacity audience, and was virtually sold out for 148 shows. The production then went on tour. Reviews for Hepburn varied, but she was noted as the only leading-lady in Hollywood who was performing high-caliber material onstage.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{included}} on the standard version of It Won't Be Soon Before Long without the inclusion of Rihanna, however, Levine stated {{in an interview with}} James Montgomery for MTV News whilst on set of the accompanying music video that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>something</b> different for the album's re-release. The singer continued, saying that he asked Rihanna to do some [...] "bits and pieces" [...] in the recording studio and that it came together very quickly. Levine stated that if there is [...] "magic" [...] between two artists, then [...] "you don't even have to think about it." [...] During the interview, Rihanna confirmed that the song would be the only one to feature a collaboration on her re-release of Good Girl Gone Bad, revealing that she had always wanted to work with the group and was honored when they contacted her. [...] "If I Never See Your Face Again" [...] was released as a single in the United States on May 2, 2008.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{started work}} on her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, she was already in an {{emotional}} state of mind, following her divorce with then-husband Sean Penn, her thirtieth birthday, and unfavorable reviews for her acting endeavors.

Feeling the need <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>something</b> different, Madonna wanted {{the sound of her}} new album to indicate what could be popular in music. However, being raised as a Catholic, Madonna felt guilty about the failure of her marriage. She said, [...] "Because in Catholicism you are a born sinner and you are a sinner all your life. ...

500|$|... "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] {{was written}} by Beyoncé Knowles, Solange Knowles, Angie Beyincé and {{produced}} as well as co-written by The Bama Boyz. Jonathan Wells of Bama Boyz said that they decided <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>something</b> {{different from what they}} usually do, by mixing several genres for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me". The song's inspiration came from the time they spent in London at the end of Beyoncé Knowles' The Beyoncé Experience tour in promotion of her second studio album B'Day (2006). The writing and production of the song began in London and was finished stateside in early 2008. They admitted that the song's structure was unusual, however they were happy that it ended up in the Knowles' hands. After The Bama Boyz produced two tracks on Solange Knowles' second studio album Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams (2008), she asked them to put instrumentals together for her to write for her sister Beyoncé.|$|E
500|$|An own goal {{scored by}} Stephen Clemence gave Arsenal a 1–0 {{victory in the}} first week of October at home to Birmingham City. Despite being [...] "technically the better side" [...] away to West Bromwich Albion, Arsenal lost 2–1; Wenger after the match commented that the team [...] "played with great spirit but … were punished for a lack of {{experience}} and maturity because we didn't take advantage of the chances we created." [...] A penalty scored by Robert Pirès was enough to secure three points against Manchester City. The midfielder wasted a second penalty in the second half, choosing to recreate a spot kick executed by Johan Cruyff and Jesper Olsen for Ajax. Having attempted to roll the ball towards onrushing Henry, Pirès inadvertently flicked the ball twice, enabling referee Mike Riley to award a free-kick to Manchester City. Although both players were scrutinised by Chelsea manager José Mourinho, they were commended by Cryuff for showing a desire <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>something</b> different. The final league match of October ended in a 1–1 draw against local rivals Tottenham Hotpsur.|$|E
500|$|A mixed {{review was}} given by Andy Gill of The Independent who said that [...] "the vocal editing on 'Start Over' is far too sloppy, {{confirming}} again that a series of individual flourishes doesn't pass muster as a performance."

[...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone also gave a mixed review for the song, saying: [...] "While the other songs on 4 all have a distinct flavor and give Beyoncé an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>something</b> new {{in some way or}} another, 'Start Over' just kind of sits there at the middle of the disc not doing much of anything."
