5|$|The failed {{offensive}} {{was investigated}} by the HV in 1991 and researched later by retired HV Brigadier Vlado Hodalj. He concluded that <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> failed because of overall poor planning and preparation, specifically citing the lack of reconnaissance and reserves. Furthermore, Hodalj cited inadequate leadership by the Sisak OG {{as a cause of}} the failure, pointing to inaction in respect of the 10th Brigade's failure to advance and improper employment of the 2nd Guards Brigade in an auxiliary role, protecting the flank of an inexperienced brigade that was committed to <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> with little, if any, training. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> itself had no clear goal. Croatian Admiral Davor Domazet-Lošo also criticised <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> as an unnecessary, purely tactical and politically counterproductive move, likely unauthorised by appropriate authorities.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was criticised for its poor planning and execution, insufficient preparation, reconnaissance and training, and inappropriate {{command and control}} methods applied by the Sisak Operational Group in charge of <b>the</b> <b>offensive.</b> It also lacked clear objectives. Afterwards, Croatian military authorities investigated <b>the</b> <b>offensive,</b> but {{found that there was}} very little written documentation, including written unit-level orders, pertaining to the operation. That led Admiral Davor Domazet-Lošo to conclude that <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> was not formally authorised. The formal investigation did not specifically charge anyone with the failures, simply specifying the problems observed instead.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from these}} three armies the Wehrmacht also {{designed}} two special units to aid <b>the</b> <b>offensive.</b> One {{of these was}} a battalion-sized airborne formation tasked with dropping behind American lines during {{the first day of}} <b>the</b> <b>offensive,</b> allowing a panzer division from the Sixth Panzer Army easy access across the Meuse. The second unit was a panzer brigade, intending to go behind enemy lines dressed in American uniforms to give false orders and spread confusion among American defenders in the Ardennes. Also earmarked for <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> were around 800 aircraft, deployed by the Luftwaffe (German Air Force), to provide air support to German forces and destroy much of the Allied air power on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Despite reservations, Hitler {{remained}} {{committed to}} <b>the</b> <b>offensive.</b> He and the OKW, {{early in the}} preparatory phase, were hopeful that <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> would revitalise German strategic fortunes in the east. As the challenges offered by Citadel increased, he focused {{more and more on}} the expected new weapons that he believed were the key to victory: principally the Panther tank, but also the Elefant tank destroyer and greater numbers of the Tiger heavy tank. He postponed the operation in order to await their arrival. Receiving reports of powerful Soviet concentrations behind the Kursk area, Hitler further delayed <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> to allow for more equipment to reach the front.|$|E
5|$|Even though <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> {{captured}} {{a portion of}} the targeted area, including the town of Lipik as the first of the larger settlements captured by the HV during the war, the mission objectives were not met before the ceasefire took effect. SAO Western Slavonia retained control of the town of Okučani and its surroundings, including a short section of the Zagreb–Slavonski Brod motorway. The halting of Operation Hurricane-91 due to the ceasefire of 3 January 1992 led to opposing assessments on the possible outcomes of <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> had there been no ceasefire. Assessments range from claims that the JNA was on the brink of defeat in the area, to estimates that the HV was too exhausted and its ammunition stocks too low to permit a successful conclusion of <b>the</b> <b>offensive.</b> The three HV offensives launched in Western Slavonia in late-1991 led to the displacement of approximately 20,000 Croatian Serb refugees who were later settled in the JNA-held Baranja region in eastern Croatia.|$|E

5|$|Hodalj {{praised the}} Sisak OG command for {{managing}} {{to keep the}} operation a secret until it was launched, making sure it would surprise the JNA. The secrecy {{was reflected in the}} apparent last-minute rerouting of the 102nd Infantry Brigade to <b>the</b> <b>offensive,</b> although the Zagreb Operational Zone deployed it to Sunja, to the east of Sisak. Still, the Sisak OG failed to prepare detailed river crossing plans, or even issue maps and written brigade-level commands for the crossingsrelying on oral commands instead. Likewise, the troops were not equipped to endure the cold weather in the open, limiting their effectiveness. Hodalj concluded that <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> exceeded needs and capabilities of the Sisak OG. Even though the 1991 HV investigation concluded that <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> was prepared for ten days and was approved by Zagreb Operational Zone command, there are no documents pertaining to the preparations other than those issued by the Sisak OG itself. Regardless of the poor preparation of <b>the</b> <b>offensive,</b> the 102nd Infantry Brigade was subject to public criticism in Croatia for fleeing the battlefield in the aftermath of Operation Whirlwind.|$|E
