5|$|This {{species is}} one of the most widely {{distributed}} salamanders in North America, second only to the tiger salamander. Its altitudinal range runs from sea level up to , spanning a wide variety of vegetational zones. The range includes isolated endemic populations in Monterey Bay and Santa Cruz, California. The distribution reconnects in northeastern Sierra Nevada running continuously along <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Coast</b> to Juneau, Alaska, with populations dotted along the Taku and Stikine River valleys. From <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>coast,</b> the range extends longitudinally to the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains in Montana and Alberta.|$|E
5|$|Around 0300UTC on October4, the Government of Mexico {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning for areas between Punta Abreojos and San Carlos on <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>coast</b> of Baja California and for areas between Santa Rosalía to Loreto on the Gulf coast of the Peninsula. Roughly twelve hours later, the warning was superseded by another tropical storm warning. The new warning was issued for areas between Punta Abreojos and El Rosario on <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>coast</b> and for areas between Santa Rosalia and Punta Final on the Gulf coast. In mainland Mexico, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued for coastal areas of Sonora between Cabo Lobos and Puerto Penasco. By 1830UTC, all of the watches and warnings were revised; on <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>coast</b> of Baja California, the warning was in effect for areas between Punta Abreojos and San Juanico; on the Gulf coast, the warning was in effect for areas between Santa Rosalia and Punta Conception; the watch for coastal areas of Sonora was upgraded to a tropical storm warning for areas between Guaymas and Cabo Lobos. Following Raymond's landfall in mainland Mexico, all warnings were discontinued by 1200UTC on October5.|$|E

5|$|Football on <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Coast</b> {{had been}} on the rise since the late 1910s. Early in 1922, Warner signed a {{contract}} with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of Pacific Coast football made Warner make the big change. Years later, he wrote:I felt my health would be better on <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>coast.</b> Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season I would be in poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching while I recuperated in a hospital. Doctors advised me that the climate of <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>coast</b> would be much better for a man of my age and in the work in which I was engaged.|$|E

5|$|Sculptures of the Potbelly style {{are found}} all along <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Coast</b> from {{southern}} Mexico to El Salvador, {{as well as}} further afield at sites in the Maya lowlands. Although some investigators have suggested that this style is pre-Olmec, archaeological excavations on <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Coast,</b> including those at Takalik Abaj, have shown that this style began to be used {{at the end of}} the Middle Preclassic and reached its height during the Late Preclassic. The potbelly sculptures at Takalik Abaj all date to the Late Preclassic and are very similar to those at Monte Alto in Escuintla and Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala.|$|E

On October 11 at around 2 AM PDT, a hurricane watch was declared for <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>coast</b> of Mexico from Tecpán de Galeana to Punta San Telmo. Six hours later, the hurricane watch was adjusted and {{in effect for}} the coast from Zihuatanejo to Manzanillo. They were all discontinued later that day as the chance of Odile becoming a hurricane diminished.|$|E
5|$|Although use of {{the local}} Ocosito-style {{ceramics}} continued, there was a marked intrusion of K'iche' ceramics from the highlands in the Postclassic period, concentrated particularly {{in the northern part}} of the site but extending to cover the whole.

5|$|Among his {{publications}} were {{a series}} of articles about fish management, collected and reprinted as Salmon of <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Coast</b> in 1893. Despite his efforts to maintain a steady fish supply through egg-collecting and fish-rearing, salmon catches on the Rogue, rising in some years and falling in others, generally declined over time. Seventeen years after Hume's death in 1908, the state closed the river to commercial fishing.|$|E
