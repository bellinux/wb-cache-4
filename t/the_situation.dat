5|$|<b>The</b> <b>situation</b> was now {{precarious}} {{and violence}} appeared likely as the rebels prepared to unleash a volley of arrows. Richard rode forwards towards {{the crowd and}} persuaded them to follow him away from Smithfields, to Clerkenwell Fields, defusing <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> Walworth meanwhile began {{to regain control of}} <b>the</b> <b>situation,</b> backed by reinforcements from the city. Tyler's head was cut off and displayed on a pole and, with their leader dead and the royal government now backed by the London militia, the rebel movement began to collapse. Richard promptly knighted Walworth and his leading supporters for their services.|$|E
5|$|After 10:00 am <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> rapidly {{deteriorated}} when provocateurs {{came into}} action, claiming {{that members of}} the negotiating delegation had been arrested. The local units of the regular police (Milicja Obywatelska) were unable to contain the crowd and <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> turned into a violent uprising as the crowds stormed the prison at Młyńska Street, where some protesters believed the members of the delegation to have been imprisoned; hundreds of prisoners were released around 10:50 am. At 11:30 am, the arms depot at the prison building was seized and the firearms were distributed among the demonstrators.|$|E
50|$|Identical {{elements}} {{theory of}} transfer- This theory {{states that the}} extent to which information learned in one situation will transfer to another situation is determined by the similarity between <b>the</b> two <b>situations.</b> <b>The</b> more similar <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> are, <b>the</b> greater the amount of information that will transfer. Similarly, if <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> have nothing in common, information learned in one situation will not be of any value in <b>the</b> other <b>situation.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Merton's {{concept of}} the self-fulfilling prophecy stems from the Thomas theorem, which states that [...] "If men define {{situations}} as real, they are real in their consequences".According to Thomas, people react not only to <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> they are in, but also, and often primarily, {{to the way they}} perceive <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> and to <b>the</b> meaning they assign to their perceptions. Therefore, their behaviour is determined in part by their perception and the meaning they ascribe to <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> they are in, rather than by <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> themselves. Once people convince themselves that a situation really has a certain meaning, regardless of whether it actually does, they will take very real actions in consequence.|$|R

5|$|By {{the evening}} of 8 April, the Yugoslav Supreme Headquarters was under the mistaken {{impression}} that <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in the 4th Army's area of operation was relatively good, believing the penetration of German troops had been temporarily halted. However, {{the effect of the}} rebellions and desertions within the 4th Army was significant within the flanking 2nd and 7th Armies, and contributed to further withdrawals. This was particularly marked {{in the area of the}} 7th Army, which was forced to withdraw from the Drava on the night of 8/9 April due to <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in the 4th Army on its right flank, leading to the loss of Maribor.|$|E

5|$|D'Ávila {{had plans}} to {{establish}} a settlement in Montejo's name near Puerto de Caballos, but knew it fell within the jurisdiction of Honduras, and that Cerezeda would never support such a move. In any case, <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in Trujillo was too precarious for Cerezeda to support a major expedition. D'Ávila became embroiled in the factional politics of the town, taking the part of Diego Díaz de Herrera. After a time, he decided to leave Honduras, and took passage {{with the majority of}} his men on a ship that stopped at Trujillo, which took them back to Yucatán. A few of D'Ávila's men stayed and settled in Trujillo, where <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> continued to deteriorate.|$|E
40|$|Pigeons' pecks at {{two white}} {{response}} keys (initial-link situation) occasionally turned both keys red (terminal-link <b>situation).</b> When <b>the</b> two keys were red, pecks occasionally produced food, {{after which the}} keys were again white. In both situations, a changeover delay prevented the response-produced outcome from immediately following a change of responding from either key to the other. In <b>the</b> initial-link <b>situation,</b> <b>the</b> ratio of pecks at the keys closely paralleled the ratio of transitions into <b>the</b> terminal-link <b>situation</b> produced by <b>the</b> pecks, conforming to the well-known matching relation. In <b>the</b> terminal-link <b>situation,</b> <b>the</b> peck ratios deviated from the matching relation toward indifference. Overall response rate and rate of changeover were generally higher in <b>the</b> terminal-link <b>situation</b> than in <b>the</b> initial-link <b>situation.</b> <b>The</b> finding of matching in <b>the</b> initial-link <b>situation</b> supports a definition of reinforcement as <b>situation</b> transition. <b>The</b> differences in performance between <b>the</b> two <b>situations,</b> viewed in <b>the</b> light of other recent findings, suggest {{that the effects of}} a changeover delay depend on the overall reinforcing value of the choice alternatives...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe current paper {{analyzes}} {{the mechanism of}} planning by New Caledonian crows. The mechanism uses predictions of results of actions. Namely, our model suggests that for a given situation and a particular action, the crow predicts <b>the</b> next <b>situation.</b> <b>The</b> mechanism of planning includes: 1) generation of needed predictions, 2) formation of a simple knowledge database that describes situations, actions, and results of actions, 3) formation of the plan of actions that result in a goal <b>situation.</b> <b>The</b> knowledge database is a table; each row of the table represents some initial <b>situation,</b> an action, <b>the</b> predicted next <b>situation,</b> and <b>the</b> estimation of a distance between <b>the</b> considered <b>situations</b> and <b>the</b> goal <b>situation.</b> <b>The</b> mental process of plan formation uses this knowledge database. The plan is the chain of consecutive actions. Beginning from <b>the</b> starting <b>situation</b> and executing this chain of actions, the crow obtains <b>the</b> goal <b>situation...</b>|$|R
