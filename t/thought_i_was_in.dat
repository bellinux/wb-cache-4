25|$|I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> with {{a chance}} but I didn't want to build up my hopes. The way I worked it out, {{it was to be}} me or Ken MacLeay and I knew I had a few years {{experience}} on him, having played Tests and more Sheffield Shield. This is the biggest thrill apart from my 1981 Test selection in England and helping bring back the Sheffield Shield to NSW last year.|$|E
2500|$|Voges {{learned of}} the news during a tour match between his side, the Cricket Australia XI, and the ECB Chairman's XI at Lilac Hill. Of his {{learning}} of the selection, Voges said: [...] "Tony Dodemaide tapped {{me on the shoulder}} and he said: 'Come with me. You're being substituted'. I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> trouble." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{my music}} was tortured, torn to shreds.... Only when Malibran was singing did I {{recognise}} my ... {{but in the}} allegro of the final scene, and precisely at the words 'Ah! m'abbraccia'... I {{was the first to}} shout {{at the top of my}} voice: 'Viva, viva, brava, brava,' and to clap my hands as much as I could. [...] My emotion was at its climax. I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Paradise".|$|E
60|$|DAISY. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> better <b>in</b> the air. But there's {{no reason}} why you shouldn't ride.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{justified}} <b>in</b> {{making the}} promise after {{what you said}} about the pleasure it would be to help me. You remember, that day on the hilltop?' ...|$|R
60|$|Before {{the reading}} of that letter was {{completed}} lions and lion-hunting had fled my <b>thoughts,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a state of excitement bordering upon frenzy.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly before O'Donnell {{left for}} India he discovered, [...] "a lump on my ribs that was sore. I made some doctors do some horrible things to ensure I got to India. I got an X-ray that showed I was missing a rib. The doctor {{was worried about}} it, but I was {{on a plane to}} India three days later. But two days into India not only did the big lump come back but he had a couple of {{partners}} and that's when I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a bit of strife." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Taguba was {{assigned}} to report on abuse of prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. In May of that year, he published an extremely critical report that was leaked to the public. Later that month, Major General Taguba was reassigned to the Pentagon to serve as {{deputy assistant secretary of}} defense for readiness, training and mobilization in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs. [...] Describing his thoughts upon being informed by John Abizaid {{a few weeks after the}} leak that he and his report would be investigated, Taguba said [...] "I'd been in the Army thirty-two years by then, and it was the first time that I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the Mafia." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Pegu, so strangely woody was {{the smell}} of the dark-colored timbers, whose odor was {{heightened}} by the rigging of kayar, or cocoa-nut fiber.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes! and I dreamt it last night, too,' {{continued}} Cadurcis. 'I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sleeping <b>in</b> the uninhabited rooms here, and {{the door}} opened, and you walked in with a light.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God!" [...] {{she cried}} fervently. [...] "Thank God {{that you are}} a man--I <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the {{clutches}} of the hideous and soulless monster, Number Thirteen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's it, exactly," [...] said Rob. [...] "I'm an American, and <b>thought</b> while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> London I'd {{drop in on}} His Royal Highness and say 'hello' to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought," [...] says Jo, who {{has started}} {{and is looking}} round, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Tom-all-Alone's agin. Ain't there nobody here but you, Mr. Woodcot?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sorry, my dear fellow," [...] I said sleepily, [...] "but do {{you know}} I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> London--in fact, I could swear that I have been there." ...|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. I {{have the}} {{greatest}} affection for you. I admire you and of course I'm grateful to you. But if I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> love with you I was mistaken.|$|E
6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "Was {{it really}} deceiving? I shouldn't call it so. And I needed your sympathy so much, and I knew I shouldn't get it unless you <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{altogether}} <b>in</b> the right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, dear! <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at home,' she sighed. 'I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> lying <b>in</b> my chamber at Wuthering Heights. Because I'm weak, {{my brain}} got confused, and I screamed unconsciously. Don't say anything; but stay with me. I dread sleeping: my dreams appal me.' ...|$|R
2500|$|An actual Canadian {{lighthouse}} keeper, Jim Abram of British Columbia, agreed. [...] "I've been lighthouse keeping for 21 years," [...] he {{told the}} magazine, [...] "and no one's ever <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> anything but a lighthouse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you, indeed! I am {{very sorry}} for it; but really I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> very good time. It is but just one. I hope {{you have not been}} here long?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Was I? Say, I--I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Alaska, {{right in}} that field of snow and ice. And I was lost! Gosh! what a scare I had!" [...] And poor Tom fairly trembled.|$|E
6000|$|He came in {{with eyes}} alight with worship. [...] "I'm heartily obliged to you," [...] he said, boyishly. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> {{for a week or}} two of cell life and reflection." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want some}} one who BELONGS in my life. He doesn't. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> swept off my feet at first by his {{good looks and}} knack of paying romantic compliments; and later on <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> MUST <b>be</b> <b>in</b> love because he was my dark-eyed ideal." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked so}} hostile that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle.|$|R
6000|$|... "At first, they evidently hardly <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> earnest. Then at last, {{when they}} found that I really {{intended}} to give the money, they brightened up, and not only gave me a shilling in change, but offered me some bread and cheese, which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> glad enough to take.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{beginning}} to understand your attitude toward me when I first came. You <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the ring--one of the people who, knowing how bad it was, led investors into this rotten scheme!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; Betty, I never was. I only <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> love." [...] A convulsive squeeze and creaking, whiffling sounds heralded a fresh outburst. [...] "Don't cry; we're just there. Think of our darling!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, madam!" [...] in {{infinite}} relief, [...] "it is you. I thought--I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> elfland {{and that}} they were paying me for the tithe to hell;" [...] and he still shuddered all over.|$|E
5000|$|Preston like to {{experiment}} with new techniques, although her most usual approach was to print her images in black with added hand colouring. She felt that printmaking helped to keep her work fresh, writing: [...] "Whenever <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> slipping <b>in</b> my art, I went into crafts-woodcuts, monotypes, stencils and etchings. I find it clears my brain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-evening, Watcher-by-Night, who <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> lost <b>in</b> the night, {{since in}} the end the night is {{stronger}} than any of its watchers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she answered, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>in</b> love--in love as I never {{hoped to}} be--as I {{did not think}} it {{possible}} to be. My love <b>is</b> such that <b>I</b> would go through hell fire for the sake of it. I do not expect you to believe me when I tell you that such is not the reason why <b>I</b> <b>am</b> leaving you. If you had loved me with the least spark of passion, if <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the least bit needful to you as a woman and as a soul, as a helper and a confidante, instead of a mere puppet to advertise your prosperity, this would not--could not--have happened. I love a man who would give up the world for me to-morrow. I have but one life to live, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to find happiness if I can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{about the}} size of it, sir. They <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a stupor when they left me, but {{as soon as they were}} gone I began to shift for myself. But I don't {{understand}} how you know about this, Captain Putnam." ...|$|E
6000|$|Haney clicked {{with his}} tongue, as if {{listening}} to a child. [...] "There now! I must have been taking more grape-juice than was good for me to start on that story, for it's all about meself and the great man I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> those days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, that’s {{the worst}} of it," [...] said Uncle Barber, shaking his head. [...] "While I was in play, that pore woman must have <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> earnest. She don’t say nothing. Not a word, and the efforts she makes to control her {{feelings}} is noble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank God," [...] {{repeated}} Aurelia. [...] "Now I {{have you}} nothing will be dreadful. But where <b>am</b> <b>I?</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> once <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a boat {{with you and}} Eugene, and some one else. Was it a dream? I can't remember anything since that terrible old woman made me drink the coffee. You have not come there, have you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} Entwistle's first solo album in six years. [...] "I had stopped writing because <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going <b>in</b> the wrong {{direction}} with the 'shoo-bop, shoo-bop,' old rock & roll stuff on Rigor Mortis Sets In and Mad Dog. When I started writing again, I {{went back to the}} kind of material <b>I</b> <b>was</b> writing before those albums.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the one," [...] said Mrs. Phillips. [...] "I little <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> letting myself <b>in</b> {{for being}} {{the wife of a}} big pot when Bob Phillips came along in 'is miner's jacket." ...|$|R
