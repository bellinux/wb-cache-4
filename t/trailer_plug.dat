50|$|Powerpole {{connectors}} {{are physically}} and electrically hermaphroditic, thus avoiding {{the need to}} worry about which end is the plug and which the socket, or which end has the correct polarity. This is in contrast to the physically- but not electrically-hermaphroditic two-wire <b>trailer</b> <b>plug.</b>|$|E

50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} either put {{a prepared}} connector {{in the vehicle}} which is a preparation on the network (Ford, Volvo) to accept a specially designed towing module, or have designed the trailer to be ‘detected’ through connections directly onto the databus (VAG, BMW). With such connections the vehicle will know when a <b>trailer</b> <b>plug</b> {{is connected to the}} socket.|$|E
50|$|The GMT800-based Suburbans were {{introduced}} in late 1999 for the 2000 model year. They were sold in two series: 1/2-ton 1500 and 3/4-ton 2500. Suburbans came in Base, LS and LT trims. Optional was pushbutton 4WD with low-range transfer case. A tow hitch with <b>trailer</b> wiring <b>plug</b> was optional.|$|R
50|$|Multicon Feder and Multicon WeSt (Welt Standard) {{connectors}} are precursors to ISO 11446 in {{a design}} that {{is intended to be}} compatible with ISO 1724. This means that if a towing vehicle has an outlet of this type it should be able to connect a trailer with a standard 7-pin or 5-pin connector according to ISO 1724, provided that the trailer coupling follows the standard and that the <b>trailer</b> <b>plug</b> casing is not made of metal since a metal plug will otherwise short the extra pins.|$|E
5000|$|The Powerpole {{connector}} {{has been}} adopted by many segments of the Amateur Radio (Ham Radio) community as their standard 12-volt DC power connector for everything from radios to DC power sources to accessories. [...] Two notable groups are Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) and Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES). [...] The Anderson Powerpole connector is {{more expensive than the}} older de facto standards of the two-wire <b>trailer</b> <b>plug</b> and the Molex connector, but provides a more reliable electrical connection (both mechanically and electrically), and is easier to adapt to a wider range of wire gauges. [...] Another advantage over the older trailer or Molex connectors is the Powerpole's superior ratings to withstand 100,000 no-load insertions and 250 hot-plugs at full load.|$|E
