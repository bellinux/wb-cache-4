The break point at 17 8 C observed in the Arrhenius plot is interpreted as due to a phase change in the lipidic bilayer, since the TBT compound, like uncouplers and mobile carriers, is sensitive to the phospholipidic phase change. Therefore, we can confirm our previous hypothesis that, as TBT is an uncoupler it, like uncouplers, crosses the biological membranes by means of an electrophoretic mechanism.

40|$|<b>Tributyltin</b> <b>compound</b> (TBT) {{released}} into the aquatic environment is generally degraded by bacteria in water and sediment. The isolation of TBT-degrading bacteria from TBT polluted sediment leads to the indication of specific potential TBT degraders. Two new strains of bacteria designated as B 2 and B 3 were successfully isolated using glycerol medium containing tributyltin chloride (TBTC) at 130 μM from contaminated sediment collected from Bowling Basin in Glasgow. The observed degradation after 14 days of the microcosm from the sediment and the isolated bacteria were investigated at an initial concentration of 1 μM TBTC. It was found that TBT was degraded by the bacterial strains B 2 and B 3 at 8. 3 and 16. 9 %, respectively. The results indicate that B 2 and B 3 are effective as TBT degraders. EC 50 of B 2 and B 3 in water were 88. 73 and 112. 53 μM TBTC, which {{were significantly higher than}} the concentration of TBT measured at the basin, suggesting a low effect of TBT on the growth and activity of bacteria.

Several organotin compounds were reported to have differential cytotoxicity on various human cell lines depending on the length of the alkyl chain. In this report, the cytotoxic effects of three tri-n-butylstannyl (halo) benzoate compounds-tri-n-butylstannyl benzoate (TBSB), tri-n-butylstannyl 2, 6 -difluorobenzoate (TBSDFB) and tri-n-butylstannyl- 2 -iodobenzoate (TBSIB) -were studied on lymphocytic cells of human leukemic K 562 lineage and epithelial cells of human breast cancer MCF- 7 cells lineage. K 562 cells were found to be more sensitive to these compounds than MCF- 7 cells. Although the induction of apoptosis by the above compounds in K 562 cells resulted from the extracellular $Ca^{ 2 +}$ influx and the generation of ROS, the initial amount of extracellular $Ca^{ 2 +}$ influx was greater in TBSB-treated K 562 cells than the cells treated with either TBSDFB or TBSIB. Similarly, DNA fragmentation by endonucleases was observed as an early event in TBSB-treated K 562 cells, which might be correlated with the initially greater extracellular $Ca^{ 2 +}$ influx. In contrast, MCF- 7 cells were found to undergo apoptosis mainly because of the generation of ROS.

In the present study, we examined if the manganese metal inside the porphyrin cavity could improve the efficacy of this class of compounds. Thus, [meso- Tetra(4 -sulfonatophenyl) porphine]Mn(III) Cl (=MnTPPS) derivatives, namely (Me 2 Sn) 2 MnTPPS, (Bu 2 Sn) 2 MnTPPS, (Me 3 Sn) 4 MnTPPS and (Bu 3 Sn) 4 MnTPPS, were tested on the A 375 human melanoma cell line. A cytotoxicity assay showed that (Bu 2 Sn) 2 MnTPPS and (Bu 3 Sn) 4 MnTPPS were highly cytotoxic by inducing apoptosis in melanoma cells, as shown by DNA fragmentation analysis and by apoptotic nuclei fluorescence, and when used at lower concentrations, they affected only cellular proliferation. An arrest of cell proliferation was also observed with (Me 3 Sn) 4 MnTPPS, but at the highest concentrations used. Moreover, the lower concentration of (Bu 3 Sn) 4 MnTPPS induced a change in cell morphology, from a polygonal to an elongated and spindle-shaped phenotype, likewise to its cognate (Bu 3 Sn) 4 TPPS, previously tested.
