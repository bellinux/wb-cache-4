500|$|The {{return of}} {{refugees}} has been hampered by several obstacles. These include property ownership and accommodation, as Croat refugees settled in vacated homes, and Croatian war-time legislation that stripped the refugees once living in government-owned housing of their <b>tenancy</b> <b>rights.</b> The legislation was abolished following the war, and alternative accommodation is offered to returnees. 6,538 housing units were allocated by November 2010. Another obstacle is the difficulty for refugees to obtain residency status or Croatian citizenship. Applicable legislation has been relaxed since, and by November 2010, Croatia allowed the validation of identity documents {{issued by the}} RSK. Even though Croatia declared a general amnesty, refugees fear legal prosecution, as the amnesty does not pertain to war crimes. [...] The final obstacle to the return of refugees {{is the lack of}} vocational opportunities due to the poor economic situation in Croatia.|$|E
2500|$|The 1979 {{amendment}} was {{considered as a}} radical departure in clinching the issue of Bargadari settlement on a judicial basis. Previously {{it was almost impossible}} for a tenant to prove his <b>tenancy</b> <b>rights</b> legally owing to the judicial and administrative red-tapism. But in the new amendments, the responsibility of disproving a claim to bagadari rights was squarely put on the landowners. Self-Cultivation was defined as cultivation on the basis of physical participation by members of the landowner's family and resumption of land under self-cultivation were made under many stringent conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Civil {{partnerships}} in the United Kingdom, granted under the Civil Partnership Act 2004, allow same-sex couples to obtain {{essentially the same}} rights and responsibilities as civil marriage. [...] Civil partners are entitled to the same property rights as married opposite-sex couples, the same exemption as married couples on inheritance tax, social security and pension benefits, and also {{the ability to get}} parental responsibility for a partner's children, as well as responsibility for reasonable maintenance of one's partner and their children, <b>tenancy</b> <b>rights,</b> full life insurance recognition, next of kin rights in hospitals, and others. [...] There is a formal process for dissolving partnerships akin to divorce.|$|E
50|$|In many states, tenancy by the {{entireties}} {{is recognized}} as a valid form of ownership for bank accounts and financial assets. One must be careful to ensure that the {{tenancy by the entireties}} designation is chosen as opposed to other forms of joint ownership such as joint <b>tenancy</b> with <b>rights</b> of survivorship, so that the benefits of tenancy by the entireties status is not lost. For example, under Florida law, if a bank account titling document allows for tenancy by the entireties and joint <b>tenancy</b> with <b>rights</b> of survivorship, if the account is opened as a joint <b>tenancy</b> with <b>rights</b> of survivorship account, the benefits of tenancy by entireties will not attach.|$|R

2500|$|However, Robert Brenner and Chris Isett {{emphasize}} {{differences in}} land <b>tenancy</b> <b>rights.</b> [...] They {{argue that in}} the lower Yangtze, most farmers either owned land or held secure tenancy at fixed rates of rent, so that neither farmers nor landlords were exposed to competition. In 15th century England, lords had lost their serfs, but were able to assert control over {{almost all of the}} land, creating a rental market for tenant farmers. [...] This created competitive pressures against subdividing plots, and the fact that plots could not be directly passed on to sons forced them to delay marriage until they had accumulated their own possessions. [...] Thus in England both agricultural productivity and population growth were subject to market pressures throughout the early modern period.|$|E

40|$|With the {{enactment}} of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, Congress has for the third time since 1976 altered the estate tax treatment of joint tenancy property. The Federal estate tax is levied on the economic value of all property transferred from the taxable estate to the surviving spouse and heirs. Regardless of the actual value transferred by the right of survivorship, prior law often caused the full value of joint tenancy property to be taxed in the estate of the first joint tenant to die. ^ Congress has, with each recent revision of the tax law, attempted to make a more equitable determination of the value transferred by the joint <b>tenancy</b> <b>right</b> of survivorship...|$|R
40|$|Residential {{displacement}} {{by urban}} regeneration in western economies and forced relocation in the Third World countries are contentious issues. This paper, {{based on a}} household survey in Shanghai, examines the process and outcomes of residential relocation under market-oriented urban redevelopment in China. The results show that commodification of the socialist <b>tenancy</b> <b>right</b> helped to initiate large-scale urban redevelopment. First, {{there has been a}} complicated process of negotiation during residential relocation, involving residents, development companies, and government agencies. The de facto right of public housing tenants is considered by a pragmatic attitude in urban redevelopment in the early years. Second, residential relocation is accompanied by the changes in housing tenure, housing conditions, and the improved built form of planned residential districts. Nevertheless, the social conflict has become intensified recently because the deepening of commodification began to favour property developers by constraining the compensation standard for relocated households...|$|R

5000|$|Community {{property}} {{has certain}} federal tax implications, which the Internal Revenue Service discusses in its Publication 555. In general, community property {{may result in}} lower federal capital gain taxes {{after the death of}} one spouse when the surviving spouse then sells the property. Some states have created a newer form of community property, called [...] "community property with right of survivorship." [...] This form of holding title has some similarities to joint <b>tenancy</b> with <b>right</b> of survivorship. The rules and effect of holding title as community property (or another form of concurrent ownership) vary from state to state.|$|R
50|$|Estate {{planning}} {{involves the}} will, trusts, beneficiary designations, powers of appointment, property ownership (joint <b>tenancy</b> with <b>rights</b> of survivorship, <b>tenancy</b> in common, tenancy by the entirety), gift, and powers of attorney, specifically the durable financial {{power of attorney}} and the durable medical power of attorney. After widespread litigation and media coverage surrounding the Terri Schiavo case, estate planning attorneys now often advise clients to also create a living will. Specific final arrangements, such as whether to be buried or cremated, are also often part of the documents. More sophisticated estate plans may even cover deferring or decreasing estate taxes or winding up a business.|$|R
50|$|A {{concurrent}} estate or co-tenancy {{is a concept}} in property law which describes the various ways in which property is owned {{by more than one}} person at a time. If more than one person owns the same property, they are referred to as co-owners. If more than one person leases the same property, they are called co-tenants or joint tenants. Most common law jurisdictions recognize tenancies in common and joint tenancies, and some also recognize tenancies by the entirety. Many jurisdictions refer to a joint tenancy as a joint <b>tenancy</b> with <b>right</b> of survivorship, and a few U.S. states treat the phrase joint tenancy as synonymous with a tenancy in common.|$|R

In the 16th and 17th centuries Slavic pastoral communities (such as Gorals) under the Vlach law were settled in the northern Kingdom of Hungary. The colonization of peoples under the Vlach law resulted in ethnic enclaves of Czechs, Poles and Ruthenians in historical Hungary.|$|E

50|$|Further {{provisions}} of the Act pertain to agricultural tenancies including new protections for tenant farmers against eviction, {{the introduction of a}} modernised limited duration <b>tenancy</b> with greater <b>rights</b> for tenants relative to landowners and the widening of eligible assignees and inheritors of tenancies.

50|$|A {{co-owner}} {{of a joint}} <b>tenancy</b> with <b>rights</b> of survivorship deed may sever the joint tenancy by filing a petition to partition. A petition to partition is a legal right, so usually {{there is no way}} to stop such an action. When a court grants a partition action for a joint tenants with rights of survivorship deed, the property is either physically broken into parts and each owner is given a part of equal value OR the property is sold and the proceeds are distributed equally between the co-owners regardless of contribution to purchase price. No credits would be issued to any tenant who may have made a superior contribution toward purchase price.|$|R
50|$|The buyer(s) {{signing the}} real estate {{contract}} are liable (legally responsible) for providing the promised consideration for {{the real estate}}, which is typically money {{in the amount of}} the purchase price. However, the details about the type of ownership may not be specified in the contract. Sometimes, signing buyer(s) may direct a lawyer preparing the deed separately what type of ownership to list on the deed and may decide to add a joint owner(s), such as a spouse, to the deed. For example, types of joint ownership (title) may include tenancy in common, joint <b>tenancy</b> with <b>right</b> of survivorship, or joint tenancy by the entireties. Another possibility is ownership in trust instead of direct ownership.|$|R

50|$|A {{joint tenancy}} or joint <b>tenancy</b> with <b>right</b> of {{survivorship}} (JTROS, JTWROS or JT TEN WROS) {{is a type}} of concurrent estate in which co-owners have a right of survivorship, meaning that if one owner dies, that owner's interest in the property will pass to the surviving owner or owners by operation of law, and avoiding probate. The deceased owner's interest in the property simply evaporates and cannot be inherited by his or her heirs. Under this type of ownership, the last owner living owns all the property, and on his or her death the property will form part of their estate. Unlike a tenancy in common, where co-owners may have unequal interests in a property, joint co-owners have an equal share in the property.|$|R
5000|$|In a joint <b>tenancy</b> with <b>rights</b> of {{survivorship}} deed, or JTWROS, {{the death}} of one tenant means that the surviving tenant(s) become the sole owner(s) of the estate. Nothing passes to the heirs of the deceased tenant. In some jurisdictions, the specific words [...] "with right of survivorship" [...] must be used, or the tenancy will assumed to be tenants in common without rights of survivorship. The co-owners always take a JTWROS deed in equal shares, so each tenant must own an equal share of the property regardless of his/her contribution to purchase price. If the property is someday sold or subdivided, the proceeds must be distributed equally with no credits given for any excess than any one co-owner may have contributed to purchase the property.|$|R
40|$|Many {{people think}} an estate plan {{is just a}} will, but {{it is much more}} than that. Your estate plan will {{typically}} include documents and tools to distribute your property according to your wishes following your death. When it comes to transitioning your farm or any family business to the next generation, how property is owned and the property transfers prior to your death can be important features of your succession plan or estate plan. Titling property in a joint <b>tenancy</b> with <b>rights</b> of survivorship allows you to choose who inherits upon your death and to transfer the property outside the will. Transferring property, such as through gifting, allows property to go to the next generation prior to your death and provides control over who gets your property...|$|R
