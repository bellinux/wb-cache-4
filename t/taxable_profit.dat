2500|$|When the Taxation Commissioner's {{ruled that}} the £12,650 {{windfall}} from the £2 authority was a <b>taxable</b> <b>profit,</b> Bjelke-Petersen appealed, eventually taking the matter to the High Court. The appeal was dismissed, with Justice Taylor ruling that Bjelke-Petersen's six million percent gain from the £2 authority arose from [...] "a profit-making undertaking". In 1962 Artesian transferred its Authority to Prospect to a new company, Exoil NL, for £190,000, and Bjelke-Petersen in turn bought a million shares in Exoil.|$|E

[...] It did not pay a patronage dividend to members, though each year around £90,000 of profits was distributed to local causes as “Community Dividend Grants”, and <b>taxable</b> <b>profit</b> was re-invested in the business. [...] A voluntary president and board of directors were elected from among the members holding at least four shares, on a one member one vote basis; the board supervised the chief executive and management.

Separate rules apply for dual resident companies.|$|R
2500|$|In {{recent times}} {{there have been}} two major tax reforms in Norway. The first, the tax reform of 1992, was a {{pervasive}} and principle based reform, inline with the international trend of broader tax base and lower rates. Corporate taxation was designed so that the <b>taxable</b> <b>profit</b> should correspond to the actual budget surplus. [...] This meant, among other things that different industries, forms of ownership, financing methods and investment were treated equally (neutrality) and that revenues and related expenditures were subject to the same tax rate. In the personal income tax, a clearer distinction between labour income and investment income was introduced (split - a dual income tax system). Ordinary income, income less standard deductions and deductible expenses, was taxes at a flat rate of 28%. On personal income, income from work and pensions, there were in addition levied social security contributions and surtax. To avoid that income that was taxed at the corporate level also were taxed at the individual level (double taxation), the imputation tax credit for dividends and treasury system gains was introduced.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between accounting and taxation in the United Kingdom is explored in this article. The first section considers historical {{reasons for the}} relative independence of contemporary calculations of accounting <b>profits</b> and <b>taxable</b> <b>profits.</b> Despite the formal independence of {{important aspects of the}} calculation regimes, effective interdependence of practice is a feature of the United Kingdom's tax and accounting histories. The second section outlines the current law and practice governing the recognition of <b>taxable</b> <b>profits,</b> and reviews the financial reporting standards and practices that have been developed to deal with tax/accounting differences. Finally, recent developments in financial report-ing and taxation are identified that are likely {{to have an impact on}} the character of the {{relationship between}} tax and accounting in the future. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Taxable</b> <b>profit</b> {{is rarely}} {{shown in the}} {{published}} financial statements. Due to the differences between nominal tax rates and actual taxes paid, analysts sometimes refer to the effective tax rate, which is (actual) taxes divided by profit before tax. In the example above, the effective tax rate would be 10%.|$|E
50|$|Formulary {{apportionment}} {{does not}} reflect the economic profit or loss of each entity.

50|$|The {{starting}} point for computing <b>taxable</b> <b>profits</b> is profits before tax (except for a life assurance company).

50|$|The {{assessment}} {{base for}} the corporation tax charged is the revenue which the corporate enterprise has earned during the calendar year. <b>Taxable</b> <b>profits</b> are determined using the result posted in the annual accounts (balance sheet and Income statement) drawn up under the Commercial Code.
