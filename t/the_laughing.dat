Miranda and Sal are friends again. While her mother is on-stage, Miranda reminisces about a {{conversation}} with Marcus about how no one would recognize a time-traveler from a different age.

5|$|Aspiring {{musician}} and scenester Bob Markley managed {{to join the}} group <b>the</b> <b>Laughing</b> Wind {{in exchange for his}} connections in the music industry and substantial bankroll. The original five-piece line-up consisted of Michael Lloyd (rhythm guitar, vocals), Shaun Harris (bass guitar, vocals, Danny Harris (lead guitar, vocals), John Ware (drums), and Markley (tambourine, vocals). Although Markley possessed the least musical talent, his expertise in law enabled him to assume control of the group's name and publishing, which generated a divide in the WCPAEB's creative mindset.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those of}} all passerines, the chicks are altricial; {{they are born}} blind and covered only by sparse tufts of brown down on their backs, {{shoulders}} and parts of wings. By four days they open their eyes, and pin feathers emerge from their wings on day six, {{and the rest of}} the body on days seven and eight. Both parents feed the young, and are sometimes assisted by helper birds. The Pacific koel and pallid cuckoo (Cuculus pallidus) have been recorded as brood parasites of the blue-faced honeyeater, and <b>the</b> <b>laughing</b> kookaburra recorded as preying on broods.|$|E

50|$|Network {{research}} {{suggested that}} <b>the</b> <b>laugh</b> track was mandatory {{in order to}} brand a single-camera show as a comedy.

Partly due to the somewhat cerebral nature of the show's humor, the version without <b>the</b> <b>laugh</b> track failed while the version with laughter succeeded. The show was broadcast with <b>the</b> <b>laugh</b> track, and CBS utilized a laugh track for allcomedies afterwards.|$|R
5000|$|Rocky and His Friends (ABC, 1959—61; NBC, 1961—64 as The Bullwinkle Show) was {{originally}} broadcast with a <b>laugh</b> track, against <b>the</b> wishes of creators Jay Ward and Bill Scott, who disputed <b>the</b> <b>laugh</b> track with ABC; given the rapid-fire {{pace of the}} show's humor, <b>the</b> <b>laugh</b> track slowed <b>the</b> timing and at times interrupted dialogue.

5|$|The willie wagtail is insectivorous {{and spends}} much time chasing prey in open habitat. Its common name {{is derived from}} its habit of wagging its tail {{horizontally}} when foraging on the ground. Aggressive and territorial, the willie wagtail will often harass much larger birds such as <b>the</b> <b>laughing</b> kookaburra and wedge-tailed eagle. It has responded well to human alteration of the landscape and is a common sight in urban lawns, parks, and gardens. It was widely featured in Aboriginal folklore around the country as either a bringer of bad news or a stealer of secrets.|$|E

Many of these actors, including Soelastri and Fatimah, {{had been with}} Union since its first production, Kedok Ketawa (<b>The</b> <b>Laughing</b> Mask), in 1940.

5|$|Union Films was {{established}} in 1940 by ethnic Chinese businessmen Ang Hock Liem and Tjoa Ma Tjoen. After the success of its first production, Kedok Ketawa (<b>The</b> <b>Laughing</b> Mask), the director Jo An Djan left for Populair's Film. Union hired new talent, including R Hu, Rd Ariffien, and Saeroen. All three were instrumental {{in the production of}} Harta Berdarah; Hu and Ariffien served as co-directors, both in their debuts, and Saeroen– who had written the commercial successes Terang Boelan (Full Moon; 1937) and Fatima (1938) for other companies– wrote the story. Ariffien credited their hirings to Union's interest in attracting educated Native audiences.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} large natural ranges. The eared dove ranges across the {{entirety}} of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the Eurasian collared dove has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and <b>the</b> <b>laughing</b> dove across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Other species have tiny, restricted distributions; this is most common in island endemics. The whistling dove is endemic to the tiny Kadavu Island in Fiji, the Caroline ground dove is restricted to two islands, Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands, and the Grenada dove is restricted to Grenada in the Caribbean. Some continental species also have tiny distributions; for example, the black-banded fruit dove is restricted to a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia, the Somali pigeon is restricted to a tiny area of northern Somalia, and Moreno's ground dove is restricted to the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern Argentina.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-and-white}} film starred Rd Soekarno, Oedjang, Boen Sofiati, and Soehaena; it {{also featured}} Ratna Djoewita, Ratnasih, Gamari Fadjar, and Moesa. Oedjang had acted for Union since its first film, Kedok Ketawa (<b>The</b> <b>Laughing</b> Mask; 1940), while Soekarno and Soehaena {{had made their}} debuts in Soeara Berbisa. Sofiati, a stage actress who operated her own troupe, was a newcomer to cinema. This cast was of various socio-economic backgrounds, including noblemen and stage actors. Although Union stated that the film was made along realist lines and aimed at educated viewers, owing to the inclusion of stage actors– people who usually entertained lower class audiences– the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran suggests that this was untrue.|$|E

5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} (Crocuta crocuta), {{also known as}} <b>the</b> <b>laughing</b> hyena, is a species of hyena, {{currently}} classed as the sole member of the genus Crocuta, native to Sub-Saharan Africa. It is listed as being of least concern by the IUCN on account of its widespread range and large numbers estimated between 27,000 and 47,000 individuals. The species is, however, experiencing declines outside of protected areas due to habitat loss and poaching. The species may have originated in Asia, and once ranged throughout Europe {{for at least one}} million years {{until the end of the}} Late Pleistocene. The spotted hyena is the largest known member of the Hyaenidae, and is further physically distinguished from other species by its vaguely bear-like build, its rounded ears, its less prominent mane, its spotted pelt, its more dual purposed dentition, its fewer nipples and the presence of a pseudo-penis in the female. It is the only mammalian species to lack an external vaginal opening.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{characters}} are Miranda, and <b>the</b> <b>laughing</b> man (Marcus). Stead began writing When You Reach Me in 2007 after reading {{an article in}} The New York Times gave her {{an idea for a}} novel about traveling in time to save someone's life. The article was about a man who woke up in Denver suffering from amnesia, having forgotten who he was or why he was there. Many people worked with the man to help him regain his memory. Under hypnosis, he spoke about his apparent wife, Penny, and two daughters who died in a car crash. However, when he and Penny reunited, the man found out she was only his fiancée— and they had no children. Upon reading this, Stead wondered if somehow the man had returned to the past to prevent an accident but lost his memory along the way. In addition, the article reminded Stead of a strange old man, called the 'laughing man', who lived near her house as a child.|$|E

5|$|The kakapo {{was a very}} {{successful}} species in pre-human New Zealand, {{and one of the}} reasons for this was their set of adaptations to effectively avoid predation from native birds of prey, which were their only predators in the past. However, these same behaviours have been of no use to them when faced with the mammalian predators which were introduced to New Zealand after human settlement, because these hunt in different ways. As hunters, birds behave very differently from mammals, relying on their powerful vision to find prey, and thus they usually (with the exception of owls) hunt by day. Apart from the two surviving New Zealand raptors, the New Zealand falcon and swamp harrier, there were two other birds of prey in pre-human New Zealand: Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier. All four species soared overhead searching for prey in daylight, and to avoid these avian predators, the kakapo's ancestors adopted camouflaged plumage and became nocturnal. In addition, when the kakapo feels threatened, it freezes, so that it is more effectively camouflaged in the forest vegetation which their plumage resembles. It was not entirely safe at night, when <b>the</b> <b>laughing</b> owl was active, and it is apparent from their nest deposits on Canterbury limestone cliffs that the kakapo was among their prey.|$|E
