40|$|Groundwater inputs are {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>streams</b> for {{their influence on}} stream hydrology and ecology (Hayashi and Rosenberry 2002). Spatial variability of groundwater inputs <b>to</b> <b>streams</b> is common due to aquifer heterogeneity, slope, and variability in land cover. Groundwater withdrawals may also affect groundwater inputs <b>to</b> <b>streams</b> by pirating water from them. In the past, groundwater inputs <b>to</b> <b>streams</b> have been quantified by seepage runs, seepage meters, piezometers, tracers, and numerical models. In karst settings (limestone and dolomite bedrock), seasonal and diurnal water temperature variations {{have been used to}} indicate the nature of aquifers draining to springs (Schuster and White 1971). Springs with large diurnal and seasonal water temperature variations are thought to derive much of their flow from conduit or fracture-flow systems that rapidly discharge <b>to</b> the <b>stream,</b> often resulting in “flashy ” hydrographs. Springs with subdued diurnal and seasonal water temperature variations are thought to derive their discharge from slowly draining diffuse aquifer systems, where the subsurface flow through porous media {{is more important than the}} flow through large fracture o...|$|R

5|$|PlayStation TV, {{known in}} Asia as PlayStation Vita TV, is a microconsole and a non-portable {{variant of the}} PlayStation Vita handheld. It was {{announced}} on September 9, 2013 at a Sony Computer Entertainment Japan presentation. Instead of featuring a display screen, the console connects to a television via HDMI. Users can play using a DualShock 3 controller, although due to the difference in features between the controller and the handheld, certain games are not compatible with PS TV, {{such as those that}} are dependent on the system's touch-screen, rear touchpad, microphone or camera. The device is said to be compatible with over 100 Vita games, as well as various digital PlayStation Portable, PlayStation and PC Engine titles. The system supports Remote Play compatibility with the PlayStation 4, allowing players <b>to</b> <b>stream</b> games from the PS4 to a separate TV connected to PS TV, and also allows users <b>to</b> <b>stream</b> content from video services such as Hulu and Niconico, as well as access the PlayStation Store. The system was released in Japan on November 14, 2013, in North America on October 14, 2014, and in Europe and Australasia on November 14, 2014.|$|E

5|$|The game uses LaserDisc {{technology}} <b>to</b> <b>stream</b> pre-recorded animation, {{which was}} produced by Japanese studio Toei Animation.

Several factors prevented an overseas release: {{a decline in the}} popularity of laserdisc arcade games in the mid-80s, the expensive price of laserdisc technology, and difficulty to translate. In the original Japanese Reika is voiced by Yuriko Yamamoto.|$|E

5|$|During the withdraw, however, A Company {{ran into}} a sizable North Korean force and had {{scattered}} in the ensuing fight. Most of the company, including its commander were killed at close range. In this desperate action, Private First Class Luther H. Story, a weapons squad leader, fought so tenaciously that {{he was awarded the}} Medal of Honor. Badly wounded, Story refused to be a burden to those who might escape, and when last seen was still engaging North Korean at close range. Of those in the company, approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines. The next morning, under heavy fog, the group made its way by compass toward Yongsan. From a hill at 12:00, after the fog had lifted, the men looked down on the Battle of Yongsan which was then in progress.

5|$|In April 2015, Activision {{announced}} a new entry in the series, titled Guitar Hero Live. The title was developed by Activision's internal studio FreeStyleGames, who previously had worked on the DJ Hero spinoff titles. FreeStyleGames were given free rein to reboot the Guitar Hero series for next-generation consoles. One of their first innovations was to drop the standard five-button guitar controller, ultimately designing a six-button guitar controller, with two rows of three buttons each, allowing them to mimic actual guitar fingering. Guitar Hero Live was released with both a career and an online mode. The career mode used full-motion video taken {{from the perspective of}} a lead guitarist underneath the note highway, to create an immersive experience to the player. The online mode, called GHTV, discarded the previous downloadable content approach and used a music video channel approach <b>to</b> <b>stream</b> playable songs to players, adding new songs to the catalog on a weekly basis. The game was released in October 2015.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1989s release, Swift {{stressed}} the importance of albums to artists and fans. In November 2014, she removed her entire catalog from Spotify, arguing that the streaming company's ad-supported, free service undermined the premium service, which provides higher royalties for songwriters. In June 2015, Swift criticized Apple Music in an open letter for not offering royalties to artists during the streaming service's free three-month trial period and stated that she would pull 1989 from the catalog. The following day, Apple announced that it would pay artists during the free trial period, and Swift agreed <b>to</b> <b>stream</b> 1989 on the streaming service. Swift's intellectual property rights management and holding company, TAS Rights Management, filed for 73 trademarks related to the singer and the 1989 era memes. She re-added her entire catalog to Spotify, Amazon Music and Google Play in June 2017.|$|E
