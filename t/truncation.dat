5|$|Restrictive N-terminal truncation: The {{approximately}} 30 {{amino acids}} N-terminal extension of cTnI is an adult heart-specific structure. The N-terminal extension contains the PKA phosphorylation sites Ser23/Ser24 and {{plays a role}} in modulating the overall molecular conformation and function of cTnI. A restrictive N-terminal <b>truncation</b> of cTnI occurs at low levels in normal hearts of all vertebrate species examined including human and significantly increases in adaptation to hemodynamic stress and Gsα deficiency-caused failing mouse hearts. Distinct from the harmful C-terminal <b>truncation,</b> the restrictive N-terminal <b>truncation</b> of cTnI selectively removing the adult heart specific extension forms a regulatory mechanism in cardiac adaptation to physiological and pathological stress conditions.|$|E

A third possibility is that the halo formation was truncated as a result of early feedback from the active galactic nucleus at the core of M87.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNeurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are {{comprised}} of the microtubule-associated protein tau, {{in the form}} of filamentous aggregates. In addition to the well-known changes in phosphorylation state, tau undergoes multiple <b>truncations</b> and shifts in conformation as it transforms from an unfolded monomer to the structured polymer characteristic of NFT. <b>Truncations</b> at both the amino- and carboxy-termini directly influence the conformation into which the molecule folds, and hence the ability of tau to polymerize into fibrils. Certain of these <b>truncations</b> may be due to cleavage by caspases as part of the apoptotic cascade. In this review, we discuss evidence that strongly suggests that these <b>truncations</b> occur in an orderly pattern and directly influence the ability of tau to polymerize into filaments...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} spherical <b>truncations</b> of the 1 /r {{interactions}} in models {{for water and}} acetonitrile yield very accurate results in bulk simulations for all site-site pair correlation functions as well as dipole-dipole correlation functions. This good performance in bulk simulations contrasts with the generally poor results found {{with the use of}} such <b>truncations</b> in nonuniform molecular systems. We argue that Local Molecular Field (LMF) theory provides a general theoretical framework that gives the necessary corrections to simple <b>truncations</b> in most nonuniform environments and explains the accuracy of spherical <b>truncations</b> in uniform environments by showing that these corrections are very small. LMF theory is derived from the exact Yvon-Born-Green (YBG) hierarchy by making physically-motivated and well-founded approximations.

5|$|By 1936, several U.S. {{highways}} {{had been}} added to the system that took over parts of State Highway 8's route. US-62, added in 1930, took over the Lawton–Anadarko portion of the road. US-277 took over much of the remaining route between Randlett and Lawton. In addition, a US-70N had been created that overlaid US-277 between Randlett and the split with SH-5 west of Walters. These changes to the U.S. route system precipitated the <b>truncation</b> of SH-8 in 1936. On 1936-03-13, the section of the route between Anadarko and the state line was dropped. However, a new road between Anadarko and Cyril had been built; this became part of SH-8 and set the highway's southern terminus at its present location.|$|E

40|$|Spherical <b>truncations</b> of Coulomb {{interactions}} in standard models for water permit efficient molecular simulations and can give remarkably accurate {{results for the}} structure of the uniform liquid. However <b>truncations</b> are known to produce significant errors in nonuniform systems, particularly for electrostatic properties. Local molecular field (LMF) theory corrects such <b>truncations</b> by use of an effective or restructured electrostatic potential that accounts for effects of the remaining long-ranged interactions through a density-weighted mean field average and satisfies a modified Poisson's equation defined with a Gaussian-smoothed charge density. We apply LMF theory to three simple molecular systems that exhibit different aspects of the failure of a naive application of spherical <b>truncations</b> [...] water confined between hydrophobic walls, water confined between atomically-corrugated hydrophilic walls, and water confined between hydrophobic walls with an applied electric field. Spherical <b>truncations</b> of 1 /r fail spectacularly for the final system in particular, and LMF theory corrects the failings for all three. Further, LMF theory provides a more intuitive way to understand the balance between local hydrogen bonding and longer-ranged electrostatics in molecular simulations involving water.
