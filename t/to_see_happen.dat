50|$|After a {{few more}} years of {{teaching}} and some visiting professor positions at area universities, Holt wrote his next two books, The Underachieving School (1969) and What Do I Do Monday? (1970). Both books focused on his belief that schools werent working and ideas about how they could be better. Holt had determined by this time that the changes he would like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>happen</b> in the school systems were not likely to become a reality. These changes included the relationship between children and the teachers and school community. At this point in the history of education, the free school movement was in full swing, and his next book, Freedom and Beyond (1972), questioned much of what teachers and educators really meant when they suggested children should have more freedom in the classroom. While Holt was an advocate of children having more rights and abilities to make decisions for themselves, he felt that the free school movement was not {{the answer to the question}} of how to fix the school system.|$|E
