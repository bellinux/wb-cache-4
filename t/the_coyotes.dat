5|$|Reinsdorf {{was one of}} two bidders for the Phoenix Coyotes {{that would}} commit to not {{relocating}} the team. On July 29, 2009 Reinsdorf and his group were approved for ownership of <b>the</b> <b>Coyotes</b> for $148 million. In August 2009, it was reported that Jerry Reinsdorf & Ice Edge LLC had dropped its bid for <b>the</b> <b>Coyotes,</b> leaving only Balsillie and the NHL as bidders for the team. The NHL bid ultimately prevailed, however the league stated it wished to re-sell the franchise as soon as possible. On March 24, 2010, it was reported that Reinsdorf was once again a possible buyer for the Phoenix Coyotes. Reinsdorf had been working out an arrangement to make the deal more feasible with the municipality of Glendale, Arizona. As late as August 2011, negotiations between Reinsdorf and the City of Glendale were still in process for the purchase of <b>the</b> <b>Coyotes.</b> However, in 2013, <b>the</b> <b>Coyotes</b> were sold to IceArizona, a group of investors that did not include Reinsdorf.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 2009–10 season, Jovanovski missed ten {{games with}} a lower-body injury in November and December 2009. Shortly after {{returning}} to <b>the</b> <b>Coyotes</b> lineup, he was suspended for two games by the NHL for a hit {{to the head of}} Minnesota Wild forward Andrew Ebbett with his forearm on December 7, 2009. The following month, he received another two-game suspension for elbowing New York Islanders rookie forward John Tavares in the head. Over 66 games during the season, he notched 10 goals and 34 points. He was overtaken as the team's top-scoring defenceman by Keith Yandle, who had scored 41 points. While the season was marked with an uncertain future for <b>the</b> <b>Coyotes</b> from a business perspective, as the franchise had filed for bankruptcy in May 2009 and was taken over by the NHL, the team performed well and recorded their best season in history. With 50 wins and 107 points (a 28-point improval from the previous season), they finished with the third best record in the West and came within five points of a Pacific Division and Conference title, trailing only the San Jose Sharks. Facing the Detroit Red Wings in the opening round, <b>the</b> <b>Coyotes</b> were eliminated in seven games. Jovanovski had one goal and no assists in his first NHL playoffs since 2004.|$|E
5|$|The Senators {{struggled}} {{late in the}} 2007–08 season, leading {{general manager}} Bryan Murray to make changes to the team. Both Emery and McGrattan were sent from Ottawa in separate transactions. McGrattan, a pending free agent, {{was traded to the}} Phoenix Coyotes on June 25, 2008, in exchange for a fifth-round draft pick in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. <b>The</b> <b>Coyotes</b> subsequently signed him to a one-year contract for the 2008–09 season. However, he played only three games with Phoenix before he voluntarily entered the league's substance abuse program. McGrattan's struggles with alcohol abuse reached its lowest point and he spent over two months at an Arizona rehab centre as he worked toward changing his life. He returned to <b>the</b> <b>Coyotes</b> late in the season but played only two additional games before he suffered a shoulder injury that required surgery to repair.|$|E

Iktomi decides to take <b>the</b> <b>coyote</b> back to his teepee to cook. But <b>the</b> <b>coyote</b> is alive, and when Iktomi arrives at his place, he builds a fire and throws <b>the</b> <b>coyote</b> into <b>the</b> fire. <b>The</b> <b>coyote</b> escapes <b>the</b> fire and tells Iktomi that he had better make sure his prey is dead before preparing the meal.|$|R

5|$|As a free agent, Aulie {{accepted}} a professional try-out contract {{to attend the}} training camp of the Arizona Coyotes on September 9, 2015. A month into the 2015–16 season, Aulie was signed to a professional try-out contract with <b>the</b> <b>Coyotes</b> AHL affiliate, the Springfield Falcons on November 3, 2015. Aulie featured in 7 games for 1 goal over the duration of his try-out before he was released on November 26, 2015. On January 3, 2016, Aulie signed his first European contract, joining HIFK of the Finnish Liiga {{for the remainder of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|During the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, he was dealt, {{along with}} defenseman Nick Boynton and a second-round {{pick in the}} draft, to the Florida Panthers in {{exchange}} for forward Olli Jokinen. Upon trading for Ballard, Florida head coach Jacques Martin heralded him as the club's number-two defenseman, behind Jay Bouwmeester. Prior to the 2008–09 season, Ballard signed a six-year, $25.2 million contract extension with the Panthers. The deal came with a season remaining on his existing contract, previously signed with <b>the</b> <b>Coyotes.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} month of the 2010–11 season, Jovanovski was chosen to serve in place of the {{suspended}} Shane Doan as team captain from October 21 to 25, 2010. Over a week later, he recorded his first career NHL hat-trick in a 4–3 win against the Nashville Predators on November 3. He scored all three goals against goaltender Pekka Rinne, becoming the first Coyotes defenceman to score a hat-trick in team history. On December 26, he became the 256th player in NHL history to play 1,000 career games, reaching the feat against the Dallas Stars. Jovanovski struggled with injuries throughout the season, missing time on six different occasions. His most serious injury was an orbital bone fracture after his face collided with an opposing player's helmet in a game against the Atlanta Thrashers on February 17, 2011. After missing 20 games with the injury, he returned in April for the last three games of the regular season and the playoffs. In Jovanovski's limited time in the season, he recorded 14 points over 50 games. <b>The</b> <b>Coyotes</b> ranked sixth in the West, drawing the Red Wings in the first round for the second consecutive year. Jovanovski recorded one assist in the post-season as <b>the</b> <b>Coyotes</b> were eliminated in four games.|$|E

Compared to the later LAV-III family of vehicles, <b>the</b> <b>Coyote</b> is physically smaller, uses smaller wheels and tires, has a [...] "sharp" [...] rather than [...] "rounded" [...] nose profile, and has a smaller, oval driver's hatch. Like <b>the</b> LAV-III, <b>the</b> <b>Coyote</b> can be fitted with additional ceramic bolt-on armour panels for increased protection. <b>The</b> <b>Coyote</b> can be transported on a Hercules C-130 transport plane but their turrets have to be removed first.|$|R
5|$|In the {{following}} season, Brulé accepted {{an invitation to}} the Coyotes' training camp for the 2013–14 season. He was assigned to the Coyotes' AHL affiliate, the Portland Pirates, to begin the season on a try-out contract before on November 30, 2013, re-signing with Phoenix on a one-year, two-way contract. Brulé played three games in his return to <b>the</b> <b>Coyotes</b> before he was reassigned to the Pirates. In declining to report back to the Pirates, Brulé opted to retire from professional hockey on January 1, 2014.|$|E
5|$|After {{recording}} 18 points (eight {{goals and}} ten assists) over 27 {{games with the}} Barons, Brulé was recalled by the Oilers on January 9, 2012, in lieu of injured forwards Nugent-Hopkins and Jordan Eberle. In order to join the team, however, he needed to clear re-entry waivers and he was consequently claimed by the Phoenix Coyotes the following day. Brulé debuted with <b>the</b> <b>Coyotes</b> on January 12, playing 14 minutes in a 3–2 shootout loss to the Detroit Red Wings. Two games later, he recorded his first two points as a Coyote, a goal and an assist, in a 6–1 win against the Colorado Avalanche.|$|E
5|$|Coyotes {{are often}} {{attracted}} to dog food and {{animals that are}} small enough to appear as prey. Items such as garbage, pet food, and sometimes feeding stations for birds and squirrels attract coyotes into backyards. About three to five pets attacked by coyotes are brought into the Animal Urgent Care hospital of South Orange County (California) each week, the majority of which are dogs, since cats typically do not survive the attacks. Scat analysis collected near Claremont, California, revealed that coyotes relied heavily on pets as a food source in winter and spring. At one location in Southern California, coyotes began relying on a colony of feral cats as a food source. Over time, <b>the</b> <b>coyotes</b> killed most of the cats, and then continued to eat the cat food placed daily at the colony site by people who were maintaining the cat colony.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>coyote</b> {{plays a role}} {{in various}} mythologies and {{creation}} myths of Native American folklore. It is variously credited for having brought fire to humanity, releasing the bison into the world, and of having slain monsters by petrifying them. The Maidu creation myth has <b>the</b> <b>coyote</b> introducing work, suffering, and death to the world. Zuni folklore has <b>the</b> <b>coyote</b> bringing winter into the world by stealing light from the kachinas. Some tribes, such as the Chinook, Maidu, Paiute, Pawnee, Tohono O'odham, and Ute portray <b>the</b> <b>coyote</b> as <b>the</b> companion of the creator. In the Paiute creation myth, <b>the</b> <b>coyote</b> was created by the wolf as a companion, and the two created land by piling soil on the water-covered world. A Tohono O'odham flood myth has <b>the</b> <b>coyote</b> helping Montezuma survive a global deluge that destroys humanity. After the Great Mystery creates humanity, <b>the</b> <b>coyote</b> and Montezuma teach people how to live. The Crow creation myth portrays Old Man <b>Coyote</b> as <b>the</b> creator. In Navajo mythology, <b>the</b> <b>coyote</b> was present in the First World with First Man and First Woman, though a different version has it being created in the Fourth World. <b>The</b> Navajo <b>coyote</b> brings death into the world, explaining that without death, too many people would exist, thus no room to plant corn.|$|R

5|$|On July 1, 2006, Jovanovski {{joined the}} Phoenix Coyotes, signing a five-year, $32.5 million contract. Having {{received}} a contract {{offer from the}} Panthers, he was speculated to return to Florida, where he spent his summers. He cited being coached by Wayne Gretzky as a strong factor for choosing Phoenix. Jovanovski was named to his fourth NHL All-Star Game in the subsequent season, but continued to be plagued with injuries. He missed the last 22 games of the 2006–07 regular season with an abdominal injury, limiting him to 29 points (first among Coyotes defencemen) in 54 games. <b>The</b> <b>Coyotes</b> finished last in the Western Conference with 31 wins and 67 points.|$|E
5|$|The 58th National Hockey League All-Star Game was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} hosted by the Phoenix Coyotes at Jobing.com Arena in Glendale, Arizona. However, due to the ongoing bankruptcy case, potential ownership changes in <b>the</b> <b>Coyotes</b> organization, {{and the possibility of}} relocation, the NHL decided to reopen bidding to host the game. In the bidding process, 14 teams made bids for All-Star Games or NHL Drafts for the next three years. Out of all the bids, the NHL chose the Carolina Hurricanes to be the new host team and on April 7, 2010, the announcement was made by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and Hurricanes President and General Manager Jim Rutherford.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Coyotes</b> signed Langkow to a one-year, $2.95 million {{contract}} in August 2004, but dealt {{him to the}} Calgary Flames {{less than two weeks}} later for Oleg Saprykin and Denis Gauthier. The season, and the contract, were wiped out by the 2004–05 NHL lockout; Langkow did not play anywhere during the lost season. The Flames signed Langkow to a new contract prior to the 2005–06 season amidst high expectations as he was placed on the top line with Jarome Iginla. He finished the season second on the Flames in both goals (25) and points (59) and recorded his sixth consecutive season with 50+ points.|$|E

5|$|Two clubs still {{experienced}} financial problems, however. The Phoenix Coyotes eventually {{filed for}} bankruptcy in May 2009. The league then took control over the team later that year in order to stabilize the club's operations, with the hopes of eventually reselling it to a new owner who would be committed {{to stay in the}} Phoenix market. The league did not find a satisfactory buyer for <b>the</b> <b>Coyotes</b> until 2013. The financially struggling Atlanta Thrashers were eventually sold to True North Sports and Entertainment in 2011, who then relocated the team to Winnipeg, a stark reversal of the league's Southward expansion more than a decade earlier.|$|E
5|$|Columbus started March with a 2–0 shutout {{against the}} Colorado Avalanche. They {{proceeded}} {{to win their}} next game against the Phoenix Coyotes 5–2, which {{marked the first time}} that the Blue Jackets posted back-to-back regulation victories during the season. Columbus again defeated <b>the</b> <b>Coyotes</b> three days later to earn their first three-game win streak of the season. They extended the streak to four with a win over the Los Angeles Kings before it came to an end with a 4–1 loss to the St. Louis Blues. It was the only four-game win streak of the season for the Blue Jackets. They immediately matched their four-game win streak with a four-game losing streak and with ten games remaining, the Blue Jackets were the first team eliminated from playoff contention. Shortly after being eliminated, they were defeated by the Edmonton Oilers 6–3; the loss clinched last place in the NHL for Columbus. It was the first time in franchise history the Blue Jackets finished in 30th place.|$|E
5|$|Due to the NHL lockout, he {{made his}} {{professional}} debut in the AHL with the Coyotes' minor league affiliate, the Utah Grizzlies in 2004–05. He notched two goals and 20 points over 60 games in his professional rookie campaign. As NHL resumed play the following season, Ballard played his first game with <b>the</b> <b>Coyotes</b> on October 5, 2005, against the Vancouver Canucks. He scored his first NHL goal in his debut, beating goaltender Dan Cloutier. Ballard finished with 8 goals and 39 points as a rookie; both remain career highs. He led all NHL defensemen in shorthanded goals with three. Ballard was sidelined for 13 games in his second NHL season due to a bone fracture in his hand, suffered while blocking a shot during a game on October 9, 2006. He went on to record 27 points in 69 games. In the off-season, he was re-signed on August 29, 2007, to a two-year contract. In 2007–08, Ballard recorded a career-low 21 points.|$|E

Five coaches have won the award with two different teams: Jacques Lemaire, Pat Quinn, Scotty Bowman, and John Tortorella have won the award twice, while Pat Burns {{is the only}} coach to win three times. The franchises with the most Jack Adams Award winners are the Philadelphia Flyers, Detroit Red Wings and Phoenix Coyotes with four winners each, although <b>the</b> <b>Coyotes</b> had two winners in Winnipeg before they moved to Arizona. Bill Barber, Bruce Boudreau and Ken Hitchcock are the only coaches to win the award after replacing the head coach who started the season. Barber took over for Craig Ramsay during the Flyers' 2000–01 season, Boudreau replaced Glen Hanlon a month into the Capitals' 2007–08 season while Hitchcock replaced Davis Payne a month into the Blues' 2011–12 season. The closest vote occurred in , when the winner Lindy Ruff edged out Peter Laviolette by a single point.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{moved to}} the Phoenix Coyotes via free agency in 2005 and signed a one-year deal. On October 28, 2005, he won his 400th NHL game. On March 28, 2006, he posted his 424th career win, thereby moving into sixth place on the NHL's all-time list, passing Tony Esposito. Joseph had shown {{interest}} in re-joining the Toronto Maple Leafs, indicating {{that he would be}} fine with a back-up role and a reduced salary. In September 2007 the Ottawa Senators quietly expressed interest in acquiring Joseph if they could unload Martin Gerber and his large contract. Joseph was a member of Team Canada in the 2007 Spengler Cup, leading them to the championship on December 31, 2007. While he was with <b>the</b> <b>Coyotes,</b> Curtis became the first goaltender to have 50 or more wins in a regular season for five different teams (St. Louis, Edmonton, Toronto, Detroit, and Phoenix).|$|E
5|$|Three days later, on March 28, goaltender Steve Mason {{was injured}} in the morning skate when a shot from Colton Gillies {{hit him in the}} mask. With Sanford again injured, York made an {{emergency}} start. Playing against the Detroit Red Wings, York made 29 saves, including 17 in the third period, helping Columbus to a 4–2 victory and giving York his first career NHL win. York remained the starter and led the Blue Jackets to a second three-game winning streak. In his fourth start, Columbus was shut out by <b>the</b> <b>Coyotes</b> despite a franchise-record 54 shots on goal, losing 2–0. The 54 saves by Phoenix goaltender Mike Smith set an NHL record for a regulation shutout. Mason returned to the starter's role for the final two games, winning both.
