Inspired by the Spitfire, an elliptical <b>tail</b> <b>profile</b> was incorporated. Elliptical wingtips and a low-wing configuration were dropped, but a low-wing Sonerai II variant was released later. The Sonerai I was designed to use a direct drive 1,600cc VW engine and the Sonerai II was designed to use the 1700cc VW engine. The wings were designed to fold alongside the fuselage for towing without a trailer and compact storage. The Sonerai II was designed to be soloed from the rear seat. The aircraft is built around a fabric covered steel tube fuselage with all aluminum wings and a fiberglass cowl. The plans cost $50 and $57 in 1974.|$|E
40|$|Gliding {{flight is}} a {{relatively}} inexpensive mode of flight used by many larger bird species, where potential energy is used {{to cover the cost}} of aerodynamic drag. Birds have great flexibility in their flight configuration, allowing them to control their flight speed and glide angle. However, relatively little is known about how this flexibility affects aerodynamic drag. We measured the wake of a jackdaw (Corvus monedula) gliding in a wind tunnel, and computed the components of aerodynamic drag from the wake. We found that induced drag was mainly affected by wingspan, but also that the use of the tail has a negative influence on span efficiency. Contrary to previous work, we found no support for the separated primaries being used in controlling the induced drag. Profile drag was of similar magnitude to that reported in other studies, and our results suggest that profile drag is affected by variation in wing shape. For a folded tail, the body drag coefficient had a value of 0. 2, rising to above 0. 4 with the tail fully spread, which we conclude is due to <b>tail</b> <b>profile</b> drag...|$|E
40|$|Research on Autonomous Underwater Vehicle(AUV) has {{attracted}} increased attention of control engineering {{community in the}} recent years due to its many interesting applications such as in Defense organisations for underwater mine detection, region surveillance, oceanography studies, oil/gas industries for inspection of underwater pipelines and other marine related industries. However, for the realization of these applications, effective motion control algorithms need to be developed. These motion control algorithms require mathematical representation of AUV which comprises of hydrodynamic damping, Coriolis terms, mass and inertia terms etc. To obtain dynamics of an AUV, different analytical and empirical methods are reported in the literature such as tow tank test, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis and on-line system identification. Among these methods, tow-tank test and CFD analysis provide white-box identified model of the AUV dynamics. Thus, the control design using these methods are found to be ineffective in situation of change in payloads of an AUV or parametric variations in AUV dynamics. On the other hand, control design using on-line identification, the dynamics of AUV can be obtained at every sampling time and thus the aforesaid parametric variations in AUV dynamics can be handled effectively. In this thesis, adaptive control strategies are developed using the parameters of AUV obtained through on-line system identification. The proposed algorithms are verified first through simulation and then through experimentation on the prototype AUV. Among various motion control algorithms, waypoint tracking has more practical significance for oceanographic surveys and many other applications. In order to implement, waypoint motion control schemes, Line-of-Sight (LoS) guidance law can be used which is computationally less expensive. In this thesis, adaptive control schemes are developed to implement LoS guidance for an AUV for practical realization of the control algorithm. Further, in order to realize the proposed control algorithms, a prototype AUV is developed in the laboratory. The developed AUV is a torpedo-shaped in order to experience low drag force, underactuated AUV with a single thruster for forward motion and control planes for angular motion. Firstly, the AUV structure such as nose profile, <b>tail</b> <b>profile,</b> hull section and control planes are designed and developed. Secondly, the hardware configuration of the AUV such as sensors, actuators, computational unit, communication module etc. are appropriately selected. Finally, a software framework called Robot Operating System (ROS) is used for seamless integration of various sensors, actuators with the computational unit. ROS is a software platform which provides right platform for the implementation of the control algorithms using the sensor data to achieve autonomous capability of the AUV. In order to develop adaptive control strategies, the unknown dynamics of the AUV is identified using polynomial-based Nonlinear Autoregressive Moving Average eXogenous (NARMAX) model structure. The parameters of this NARMAX model structure are identified online using Recursive Extended Least Square (RELS) method. Then an adaptive controller is developed for realization of the LoS guidance law for an AUV. Using the kinematic equation and the desired path parameters, a Lyapunov based backstepping controller is designed to obtain the reference velocities for the dynamics. Subsequently, a self-tuning PID controller is designed for the AUV to track these reference velocities. Using an inverse optimal control technique, the gains of the selftuning PID controller are tuned on-line. Although, this algorithm is computationally less expensive but there lie issues such as actuator constraints and state constraints which need to be resolved in view of practical realization of the control law. It is also observed that the proposed NARMAX structure of the AUV consists of redundant regressor terms. To alleviate the aforesaid limitations of the Inverse optimal self-tuning control scheme, a constrained adaptive control scheme is proposed that employs a minimum representation of the NARMAX structure (MR-NARMAX) for capturing AUV dynamics. The regressors of the MR-NARMAX structure are identified using Forward Regressor Orthogonal Least Square algorithm. Further, the parameters of this MRNARMAX model structure of the AUV are identified at every sampling time using RELS algorithm. Using the desired path parameters and the identified dynamics, an error objective function is defined which is to be minimized. The minimization problem where the objective function with the state and actuator constraints is formulated as a convex optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved using quadratic programming technique. The proposed MR-NARMAX based adaptive control is verified in the simulation and then on the prototype AUV. From the obtained results it is observed that this algorithm provides successful tracking of the desired heading. But, the proposed control algorithm is computational expensive, as an optimization problem is to be solved at each sampling instant. In order to reduce the computational time, an explicit model predictive control strategy is developed using the concept of multi-parametric programming. A Lyapunov based backstepping controller is designed to generate desired yaw velocity in order to steer the AUV towards the desired path. This explicit model predictive controller is designed using the identified NARMAX model for tracking the desired yaw velocity. The proposed explicit MPC algorithm is implemented first in simulation and then in the prototype AUV. From the simulation and experimental results, it is found that this controller has less computation time and also it considers both the state and actuator constraints whilst exhibiting good tracking performance...|$|E

40|$|A self-consistent {{field model}} {{is used to}} {{consider}} a solution of positively charged surfactants up to its critical micellization concentration adsorbing onto two surfaces in close proximity. Each surface mimics a polystyrene sulfonate interface; that is, hydrophobic properties are combined with a (fixed) negative charge. We observe large and sudden changes in adsorption {{as a function of}} separation, which are not normally considered when interpreting surface force measurements. The parameters are chosen such that the adsorbed surfactant layer is of a monolayer type when the surfaces are far apart. A typical interaction curve is presented for a fixed surfactant chemical potential, which is extracted from the set of adsorption isotherms each with a fixed slit width. When the slit width approaches the thickness of the two surfactant layers, a first-order phase transition takes place, which is driven by the unfavorable hydrophobic-water contacts. At the transition, the average orientation of the surfactants switches from a high concentration of tails at the surface to a bilayer configuration where <b>tail</b> <b>profiles</b> from both sides merge in the center. The headgroups are pulled slightly away from the surface. The interaction force jumps from a weak electrostatic repulsion at large distances (two effectively positively charged surface layers repel each other) to a strong electrostatic attraction at short distances (the central surfactant bilayer is attracted to the oppositely charged surfaces). The amount of adsorbed surfactants tend to decrease with decreasing distance between the surfaces but suddenly increases at the transition. Because of this, we anticipate that in surface force experiments, for example, there is a hysteresis associated with this transition: the forces and also the adsorbed amounts depend not only on the distance between the surfaces but also on the history if nonsufficient equilibration times are implemented...|$|R

When the pipe is straight, the fluid adopts the parabolic velocity profile of Poiseuille flow; the spread of any contaminant along the pipe is then described by the shear dispersion model of Taylor (1954) and its refinements by Mercer, Watt et al (1994, 1996). However, two conflicting effects occur in a generally curving pipe: viscosity skews the velocity profile which enhances the shear dispersion; whereas in faster flow centrifugal effects establish secondary flows that reduce the shear dispersion. The two opposing effects cancel at a Reynolds number of about 15. Interestingly, the torsion of the pipe seems to have very little effect upon the flow or the dispersion, the curvature {{is by far the}} dominant influence. Lastly, curvature and torsion in the fluid flow significantly enhance the upstream <b>tails</b> of concentration <b>profiles</b> in qualitative agreement with observations of dispersion in river flow...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to provide a}} {{reliable}} theoretical framework for performing statistical analysis on ecological diversity by means of intrinsic diversity profiles. We point out that ecological diversity is a multivariate concept as it is function of the relative abundances of species present. Patil and Taillie (1982) introduce the con-cept of intrinsic diversity ordering which can be determined by using right <b>tail</b> sum diversity <b>profile</b> usually referred to as intrinsic diversity profile. It may be noticed that the intrinsic diversity profile is very similar to the Lorenz curve. The latter uses as ordinate the cumulative proportion of the species while the ordinate of intrinsic diversity profile is the cumulative number of the species. Recent developments in environmental studies have focused on the opportunity to evaluate community diver-sity changes over time and space and/or correlation of diversity with environmental characteristics. Being the diversity profile a functional observation, we develop an innovative analysis of diversity based on a functional data approach. The basic philosophy is to think of observed data functions as single entities rather than a sequence of individual observations. In the work we focus on some applications in which our methodology could be recommended...|$|R
50|$|The {{exact number}} of {{vertebrae}} is unknown due to several {{gaps in the}} holotype's spine. The sacrum consisted of 6 fused sacral vertebrae. At least 20 presacral vertebrae formed {{the spine of the}} neck and back and ca. 50 caudal vertebrae the tail. The tail comprised about half of the body's total length; as in other dinosaurs, it counter-balanced the body and contained the massive caudofemoralis muscle, which was responsible for forward thrust during locomotion, pulling the upper tigh backwards when contracted. The tail of Ceratosaurus was characterized by comparatively high neural spines (upwards directed bony processes of the caudal vertebrae) and elongated chevrons (bones located below the tail vertebrae), giving the <b>tail</b> a deep <b>profile</b> in lateral view. Uniquely among theropods, Ceratosaurus possessed a row of small, elongated and irregularly formed osteoderms (skin bones) running down the middle of its neck, back and most of its tail. Apart from the body midline, the skin contained additional osteoderms, as indicated by a 6 × 7 cm large plate found together with the holotype specimen; the position of this plate on the body is unknown.|$|R
