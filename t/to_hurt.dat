5|$|Ahimsa {{is one of}} the {{cardinal}} virtues and an important tenet of Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Ahimsa is a multidimensional concept, inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> another being is <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> oneself. Ahimsa has also been related to the notion that any violence has karmic consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of Ahimsa, the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism. Most popularly, Mahatma Gandhi strongly believed in the principle of ahimsa.|$|E

5|$|At this time, the {{dreadnought}} design had {{not been}} fully validated, despite {{the success of the}} British namesake; for example, there were still concerns that the Minas Geraes class' superfiring turret arrangement—which {{had not been}} utilized on the original Dreadnought, but was also being installed on the American —would cause blast <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> the crew in the lower turret. Any immediate concerns, however, were mitigated during the firing tests when no ill effects were observed, though the Times (London) reported that there were still concerns registered during São Paulos gun trials in June 1910.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}.

Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the leaks and said they were intended <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E

5|$|Many mental states {{seem to be}} {{experienced}} subjectively in different ways by different individuals. And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential quality, e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since {{no one has a}} perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly how it feels <b>to</b> <b>hurt.</b> Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain.|$|E
