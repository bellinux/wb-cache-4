50|$|About {{the time}} of his {{election}} to the Reichstag, Stinnes began to buy up leading German newspapers, one of his main objects being to organize a solid and powerful bloc of opinion in Germany in support of law and order and the promotion of the highest industrial and commercial efficiency. His newspaper purchases included the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung in Berlin, formerly the organ of Otto von Bismarck and then of all the succeeding German governments, the Münchener Neueste Nachrichten and the München-Augsburger Zeitung, the latter being one of the oldest newspapers in Germany. Both of the Munich (München) journals were previously exponents of a very much more democratic <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> than that than they came to characterize them under his proprietorship.

40|$|A {{prevailing}} <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> {{in construction}} management research {{revolves around the}} importance of instilling a positive partnering culture {{in order to improve}} overall project performance. Indeed, the culture part of the equation has often been taken as a given and this has led to many normative and, at best, prescriptive claims about culture's consequences in terms of individual behaviours and practices. Despite this trend, no systematic empirical work has so far been undertaken to objectively operationalize or test the real effects of culture. This study aims to fill this research gap. Grounded in the social identity framework, this study proposes an alternative approach for operationalizing and examining culture's effects using data derived from 398 local and foreign senior managers from construction firms in Hong Kong. Results suggest that the relationships between culture and individual behaviours are far more complex than alluded to by simple normative generalizations. The study underscores an urgent need for future research to adopt a more comprehensive framework for defining and measuring culture in construction management research. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} thesis, {{explained}} {{more fully}} in the introductory chapter, is to discover and to discuss the occasions, events and movements {{in the history of}} New Zealand, which have been influenced by religious motives, prejudices and ideals. The writer has emphasized not so much the proof of a definite succession of causes and effects, but rather the discovery and the demonstration of several broad trends, through which the influence referred to has affected various phases of development in New Zealand from about 1814. In this field of historical research perhaps wore than in any other, there is a danger of passing unwarranted moral judgments upon the actions of historical characters. It is difficult to form a moral judgment upon the actions and beliefs of individuals and groups, which no longer exist, except perhaps in the memories of an older generation. It involves a knowledge and understanding of the spirit of the age under consideration, which could be attained fully only by one who was quickened by the same ideals and thrilled by the same emotions as moved those who are the subject of one's study. In such a research as this, it must also be constantly borne in mind that the religious motive was seldom, if ever, the sole cause of any event, and only occasionally was it the most important one. Briefly summarised, the scope of this thesis includes a short introductory chapter, enquiring into the relation between religion and history; a brief account of the main religious movements in Great Britain which affected the development of New Zealand, with which is associated a consideration of the religious aspect of Maori life up to 1814; the temporary and permanent influence of the missionary movements on the Maori people and on the introduction of British authority up to 1840; the place of religion {{in the life of the}} early colonists, and its influence on colonial affairs up to 1870; the relation of religion to the political, social educational and general development from 1870 to 1905; the relation of modern conditions and modern trends of thought in religion to the contemporary influence of religion upon the people, and a discussion in this light, continuing the theme of the preceding section as far as 1955; and finally, a brief review of the influence of the Jews in New Zealand in relation to the main theme. This makes seven chapters in all, followed by several appendices, including a map illustrating the geographical aspect of the work. The consideration of the sources of the information used brings us to the main difficulty. There is no dearth of information relevant to the main topic, but much of this is only incidentally treated in the various works. The main difficulty concerns the criticism of the sources. There has been no general work on the history of religion in New Zealand; there are detailed church histories, none of them very recent in date, such as the works of Jacobs and of Purchas on the Anglican Church, of Morley and of Williams on Methodism, of Dickson on Presbyterianism, of Wilson on Roman Catholicism, and so on. But these are denominational histories, valuable for their purpose, but open to criticism by the student of the religious influence on the development of New Zealand. These works, so far as they are relevant have been considered mainly in relation to the queries: “Is this matter concerned with the influence of religion?” “Does this evidence treat New Zealand as its unit?” Purely local events have been included only when they affect the history of New Zealand as a whole, as in the case of the South Island ecclesiastical settlements or the “Pai Marire” movement, or when they illustrate the geographical distribution of the influence of a religious body, as the details in Father Poupinel's letter on Roman catholic mission stations in 1864. The most valuable source referred to in connection with the early part of the work is Professor J. R. Elder's volume of the “Letters and Journals of Samule Marsden”, supplemented by his second work on “Marsden's Lieutenants”. The former work presents Marsden's letters and journals in an easily accessible form, so that the writer was able to appreciate the motives of the early missionary, and to acquire an understanding of the growing success of missionary work, as well as the realization of some inadequacies. Reference was also bad to contemporary writers and to the works of others on this period, but none was found quite so valuable as the work of Elder. For a critical analysis of the missionary influence, recourse was had to Martin's “Missionaries and Annexation in the Pacific”, a small volume which presents a viewpoint independent of religious prejudice. For the periods after 1840, apart from church histories and such biographies as that of Selwyn by Curteis, no works deal exclusively with religious topics. The general histories such as that of Rusden and the Australasian volume of the Cambridge History, of the British Empire were considered from two aspects: first, their attitude towards the religious bodies in the country: secondly, their attitude towards such problems as native policy, in the solution of which the religious factor was an important one. The Canterbury and Otago settlements were treated also in the light of the ecclesiastical conditions in England and Scotland, as outlined by standard historians. Of the social, educational and political movements of the later decades of the century, and of more recent times, each has its own distinctive literature. Cocker and Murray have edited a history of the prohibition movement; the Bible in schools League has issued many pamphlets, whose evidence has been carefully and critically considered in preparing the sections on the relation between religion and education. The parliamentary records give some indication of the <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> as the decades pass. The more recent pronouncements of denominational leaders and thinkers have also been considered, when the section on the relation of religion to modern inventions (for instance, wireless) and the labour problem was being framed. For the chapter on the Jews, insight into the question was gained by the perusal of the results achieved in the research of Miss Violette F. Balkind, and the general information was gathered from many sources. The other main difficulty has been the maintenance of an unbiassed and interdenominational viewpoint. The denominational histories, besides being criticised had to be correlated, and the general religious attitude on any particular question bad to be evolved from the study of several different views. The only way of arriving at an interdenominational attitude has appeared to be the rejection of any feature not common to the majority of views considered. Any view quoted which is not that of the majority is definitely stated to be so. It is sometimes necessary to quote the viewpoint of a single church body, especially when this body has been the precursor, in whose steps the other religious bodies have followed. An example to illustrate this is the case of the prohibition movement up to the founding of the New Zealand Alliance in 1886. The writer has to acknowledge the courtesy of many friends who have directed him to sources of information, and of others who have given time to the discussion of problems with him; especially, mention should be made of the Hon. L. M. Isitt, M. L. C., who not only granted an interview, but supplied several useful items of evidence in the form of pamphlets on the question of religious instruction in state schools; of Mr. J. Malton Murray, who extended similar courtesy with regard to the prohibition movement; of the Christchurch “Press”, who assisted in locating information; and of the Rev. M. A. Rugby Pratt, who made available the minutes of past Methodist conferences for the verification of several obscure references to the relations between that denomination and the prohibition movement...|$|E

50|$|It is {{initially}} tempting to regard immediate, dynamic, and final interpretants as forming a temporal succession {{in an actual}} process of semiosis, especially since their conceptions refer to beginning, midstages, and end of a semiotic process. But instead their distinctions from each other are modal or categorial. The immediate interpretant is a quality of impression which a sign is fitted to produce, a special potentiality. The dynamic interpretant is an actuality. The final interpretant {{is a kind of}} norm or necessity unaffected by actual <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> or interpretation. One does not actually obtain a final interpretant per se; instead one may successfully coincide with it. Peirce, a fallibilist, holds that one has no guarantees that one has done so, but only compelling reasons, sometimes very compelling, to think so and, in practical matters, must sometimes act with complete confidence of having done so. (Peirce said that it is often better in practical matters to rely on instinct, sentiment, and tradition, than on theoretical inquiry.) In any case, insofar as truth is the final interpretant of a pursuit of truth, one believes, in effect, that one coincides with a final interpretant of some question about what is true, whenever and to whatever extent that one believes that one reaches a truth.|$|R
5000|$|Peirce {{said that}} a conception's meaning {{consists}} in [...] "all general modes of rational conduct" [...] implied by [...] "acceptance" [...] of the conception—that is, {{if one were to}} accept, first of all, the conception as true, then what could one conceive to be consequent general modes of rational conduct by all who accept the conception as true?—the whole of such consequent general modes is the whole meaning. His pragmatism, since a conception is general, does not equate a conception's meaning, its intellectual purport, with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth, nor does it equate its meaning, much less its truth (if it is true), with the conceived or actual benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true in what it purports. If it is true, its truth is not transitory but instead immutable and independent <b>of</b> actual <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion.</b> His pragmatism also bears no resemblance to [...] "vulgar" [...] pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and Machiavellian search for mercenary or political advantage. Rather, Peirce's pragmatic maxim is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental reflection arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the generation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the employment and improvement of verification to test the truth of putative knowledge.|$|R

This paper describes a novel digitised splinting process using 3 D printing in an attempt to overcome these issues. The output of the investigation was the creation of a specialised computer-aided design software workflow to support 3 D printing, developed specifically for splinting practitioners in the UK, to enable them to design splints themselves for each individual patient. Method: A small-scale feasibility study was done, based on the current splinting process. A thorough literature review and physical engagement in current splinting practice was performed, highlighting key requirements for successful splint fabrication. Key requirements were then replicated in a virtual software environment. Opportunities for integrating new, novel features were explored. The key requirements were then refined into a specialised software workflow to replicate the splinting process. The specialised software was then evaluated by 10 practitioners. User trials of the software were performed, followed by semi-structured interviews. Audio recordings were transcribed and then coded to establish similar <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinions,</b> and areas for future research. No patients or vulnerable participants were involved in the study. Results: All participants were able to use and navigate around the software prototype with relative ease. Strengths included potential simplicity in modelling more complex splints, but several areas for future research are identified, including cost analysis and materials development. Discussion: The digitised splinting process shows promise for the benefit of both practitioners and their patients, provided that future research and investment can overcome current limitations...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the construction and}} presentation of nationhood and national identity in the contemporaneous Chronica Maiora of Thomas Walsingham (covering 1376 - 1420, written c. 1381 - 1420). Taking as its premise the continued vitality and importance of late medieval English Latin-language texts {{in the construction of}} English nationhood, this thesis aims to partially redress the imbalance in modern scholarship of the period toward English-language texts and the resulting neglect of Latin-language works. This thesis argues for the existence of a vibrant and complex form of national identity and sentiment within Walsingham’s chronicle, informed by both contemporary <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> and various scholarly and historiographical traditions. In this Walsingham can be located within a wide-ranging, clerical-monastic, Latinate discourse of late medieval Englishness which has been relatively neglected by modern scholarship. 	Specifically this thesis examines a number of key issues surrounding Walsingham’s construction of nationhood and English national identity. First the definitions of nationhood found in the Chronica are analysed, seeking to unpick Walsingham’s underlying beliefs and assumptions regarding what constituted a national community. Second Walsingham’s presentation and stereotyping of national groups is examined, in particular the setting-up of ‘Others’ and the significance of the idea of ancient Rome within Walsingham’s construction and glorification of England. Third the treatment of foreigners or ‘aliens’ in the Chronica is discussed, particularly the way in which Walsingham used such individuals as a vehicle with which to reflect upon and critique the English themselves. Throughout the thesis too the ambiguous but important place of the French within Walsingham’s vision of Englishness is examined in depth. In Walsingham’s text the French were not simply an enemy or a straightforward Other but were presented in rather integral but variable or even conflicted ways, reflective of the variable political and cultural position the French occupied for the English in this period. ...|$|R

This paper contrasts a <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> historical <b>opinion</b> that presents the drive to centralize the functions of justice as prompted and performed for public interests. We support a current hypothesis that the centralization of prisons in classical Athens was a causal mechanism to forcing the broader transition of justice. After state sponsored prisons, the incentive structures in the production of justice radically changed. Customary institutions, before state prisons, had developed competitive restraints to control abuses of power. With state prisons, Athenian rulers faced lower relative costs of expanding state size. The traditional evolved norms were displaced by new constructed policies. The new incentive environment promoted justice towards full state involvement. Each policy can be recognized as a strategic response to promote particular political interests. Dissecting the broad transition of justice into a series of individually motivated policy actions in no way suggests a guiding motivation in line with the public welfare...|$|R

Most of the traditional text mining work on static data sets, while the online hotspot forecasts works on the web information dynamically and timely. The earlier work on text information processing focuses in the factual domain rather than opinion domain. Due to the semi structured or unstructured characteristics <b>of</b> online public <b>opinion,</b> we introduce traditional Vector Space Model (VSM) to express them and then use K-means to perform hotspot detection, then we use J 48 classifier to perform hotspot forecast. Results: The experimentation is conducted by Rapid Miner tool and performance of proposed method J 48 is compared with other method, such as Naive Bayes. The consistency between K-means and J 48 is validated using three metrics. They are accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: The experiment helps to identify that K-means and J 48 together to predict forums hotspot. The results that have been obtained using J 48 present a noticeable consistency with the results achieved by K-means clustering...|$|R
40|$|Audit {{report is}} the primary means of {{communication}} for auditors. To reduce the phenomenon of agency conflict, auditors work as agents for shareholders and report to them after reviewing the financial statements. In last 15 years, Australia has witnessed some major changes in Australian economy which have affected Australian business and its auditors’ opinions. This paper examines the <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> audit <b>opinions</b> issued to Australian listed companies during this period. In total, 20, 473 audit opinions were sited over the 15 -year period, i. e., from 1996 to 2010. This research found that over the period, unqualified report {{was the most common}} type of audit reports issued in Australia with an average of 96. 4 %. The average rate at which the Big 4 audit firms issue unqualified reports is 88 % compared with 76 % issued by the non-Big 4 firms. It is also evidenced that the rate at which modified reports were issued during and after global financial crisis (GFC) (2007 - 2009) has increased across all industries, while the most noticeable increase occurred in the financial services, materials, and industrial sectors...|$|R

Solzhenitsyn was, in consequence, ultimately {{dismissed as a}} viable thinker in the West. This thesis takes as its first aim the critical examination of both the early and later responses to the Harvard Address to determine the patterns and <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> American <b>opinions</b> and evaluations <b>of</b> Solzhenitsyn and his thought at that time. Second, this thesis argues that generally the efforts of Solzhenitsyn 2 ̆ 7 s American critics to understand and contextualise him and the Harvard Address were unsatisfactory, {{as they approached the}} problem of Solzhenitsyn from a Western perspective and therefore inappropriately based their evaluations of him on current Western political and social ideals. Finally, this thesis is intended to contribute to the ongoing <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> recontextualising Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in the 1990 s by asserting that Solzhenitsyn is first and foremost a Christian, and that his personal Christianity forms an essential component of his thought.

On April 23, just {{a little over two}} weeks before the election, the SWS released a poll, and the headline of the SWS report by itself was historically significant: [...] "SWS April 10-17, 2004 Survey: Roco Depleted, Voters Go To GMA and Undecided". The report's first line gives away the game: [...] "Raul Roco's sudden departure for abroad cost him almost half of his voting strength, allowing Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to gain a slim lead ..." [...] That lead could not be reversed: at the last pre-election SWS opinion poll (conducted from May 1 to 4) released on 8 May 2004, or just two days before the election, [...] "GMA Leads FPJ By 7%", 37% to 30%, with 12% undecided.|$|R
40|$|In {{the article}} the author {{analyzes}} {{the parameters of}} European political consciousness, i. e. European research field of political consciousness in qualitative and quantitative terms, which may be based on different indicators. The issue of emergence and development of European political consciousness becomes topical because firstly, its formation as the subjective dimension of European integration policy is not a spontaneous process and, secondly, European integration is carried out {{not only from the}} top but from the bottom, requiring deliberate interference of the public with the process; the public possesses the formed European political consciousness. Since the latter is a specific mental construct, the author offers to apply the triad «criteria ­ parameters – indicators». The characteristic that makes it possible to evaluate certain processes or phenomena in the system of Europeanness / Europeanism and specifies the quality system <b>of</b> views and <b>opinions,</b> which are realized in European behavior, is considered to be the criterion of European political consciousness. The European political consciousness parameters are seen to include the relevant historical memory, <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> public <b>opinion</b> and awareness regarding the European Union and position of its members in the European integration process, including the assessment of the existence and development of the EU; knowledge and views on the main EU institutions, assessing the importance of the main institutions of the EU and trust in them; a positive vision {{for the future of the}} European Union etc. The author considers the performance and objective characteristics and dimensions, including positive correlation of national and European levels of identity (European identity) and European behavior to be the indicatiors of European political awareness. On the basis of these indicators the control of the condition and <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> European political consciousness development will be carried out...|$|R

It examines to what extent, and in what contexts, judges utilize social science in reaching and bolstering their rulings. The Article delves into three areas of law that are typically not grouped together—integration, gay rights, and capital punishment—to see {{the similarities and differences}} in the use of empirical findings. Analyzing the language in judicial opinions from family courts, district courts, circuit courts, and the United States Supreme Court enabled the emergence <b>of</b> <b>trends.</b> The <b>opinions</b> revealed that inconsistency in the use of social science may stem from how a given issue is framed, the tide <b>of</b> public <b>opinion</b> on an issue, and whether social science in that realm is settled. Application of these principles to the gay rights context suggests that if the Supreme Court were to hear a case on gay marriage, a national consensus on the issue would be more outcome determinative than settled social science...|$|R
