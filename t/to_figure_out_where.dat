5|$|The {{setting was}} principally based on Norway, and the {{cultural}} influences in the film come from Scandinavian culture. Several landmarks in Norway appear in the film, including the Akershus Fortress in Oslo, the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, and Bryggen in Bergen. Numerous other typical cultural Scandinavian elements are {{also included in the}} film, such as stave churches, trolls, Viking ships, a hot spring, Fjord horses, clothes, and food such as lutefisk. A maypole is also present in the film, as well as the brief appearance of runes in a book that Anna and Elsa's father opens <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> the trolls live. A scene where two men argue over whether to stack firewood bark up or bark down is a reference to the perennial Norwegian debate over how to stack firewood properly. The film also contains several elements specifically drawn from Sámi culture, such as the usage of reindeer for transportation and the equipment used to control these, clothing styles (the outfits of the ice cutters), and parts of the musical score. Decorations, such as those on the castle pillars and Kristoff's sled, are also in styles inspired by Sámi duodji decorations. During their field work in Norway, Disney's team, for inspiration, visited Rørosrein, a Sámi family-owned company in the village Plassje that produces reindeer meat and arranges tourist events. Arendelle was inspired by Nærøyfjord, a branch of Norway's longest fjord Sognefjorden, which has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site; while a castle in Oslo with beautiful hand-painted patterns on all four walls served as the inspiration for the kingdom's royal castle interior.|$|E

25|$|Cormorants {{seem to be}} a very ancient group, {{with similar}} {{ancestors}} reaching back to the time of the dinosaurs.

Hence, at least the modern diversity of Sulae probably originated in the southern hemisphere.|$|E

500|$|Tony! Toni! Toné! took a hiatus {{as a group}} {{after the}} {{commercial}} and critical success of their 1993 album Sons of Soul.

Raphael Wiggins adopted the surname [...] "Saadiq" [...] for his professional name in 1994—"man of his word" [...] in Arabic—and released his solo single [...] "Ask of You" [...] in 1995.

ABC Entertainment President Steve McPherson commented on the scheduling decision: [...] "Ultimately we decided that, without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let 'Grey's' build on its tremendous momentum through May." [...] Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would change from Grey's Anatomy to Complications, although ultimately this did not come to pass. Francie Calfo, executive vice president for development at ABC Entertainment, commented on the show's conception: [...] "I think there was a need for this kind of show on our air, specifically a medical show.

The rogue Nartec demorphs into a Red-Tailed Hawk, Tobias, and aids the others in escaping. The Animorphs climb on board the Sea Blade, only to be challenged by hordes of Nartec, wielding weapons ranging from spears and clubs, to automatic rifles and machine guns. While the Animorphs, in their standard combat morphs, had no difficulty attacking the Nartec and holding them at bay for a while, they began to be worn down by sheer force of number. Finally they struck a reluctant alliance with Visser Three (who had been hiding on the ship the whole time while his crew were killed and stuffed), who guided them in starting the Sea Blade and escaping. Under Jake's orders, Marco, whose gorilla morph was gutted by a sword, opened the hatch to the Sea Blade, and the Animorphs swam to the surface. Visser Three survived as well, though separated from the Animorphs.|$|R
40|$|Anyone {{interested}} in artificial intelligence knows {{how difficult it}} can be to find comprehensive material on the subject. Textbooks usually cannot cover all interdisciplinary aspects, and review papers are typically specialized in a particular area within the field. This poses a problem for students, but can also be a serious difficulty for the advanced researcher. Few people would claim to have competency in all aspects of artificial intelligence research. The field knows no disciplinary boundaries and the arguments span decades. Articles can be hard to locate and scattered across publications relevant to several different disciplines. Bibliographies can easily miss older or more obscure articles that may be of interest. Comprehensive and interdisciplinary resources that can act as starting points for learning or teaching artificial intelligence are increasingly needed as the field rapidly gains importance, depth and breadth.

40|$|Land {{managers}} are always {{hoping for the}} next best thing <b>to</b> help them <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> they should spend their time and money restoring and maintaining healthy rangelands. Now Agricultural Research Service rangeland ecologist Brandon Bestelmeyer has one of the answers—an ecological-state map that identifies where rangeland is holding its own, where it could respond to restoration efforts, or where it’s already past the point of no return. “We wanted {{to find a way to}} turn existing field-level rangeland assessments into broader tools for comprehensively managing larger landscapes,” says Bestelmeyer, who works at the ARS Jornada Experimental Range in Las Cruces, New Mexico. Working with U. S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) rangeland specialist Philip Smith and others, Bestelmeyer began pairing time-tested soil data and vegetation maps with state-and-transition models (STMs) to generate science-based assessments of rangeland conditions across landscapes. STMs describe the types of plant communities that can occur on a specific soil type and the shifts that occur among plant communities. Sometimes, beneficial plant communities have persisted through past events. Other times these plant communities have been so altered by invasive plants, soil degradation, or other processes that they require management interventions— reseeding, herbicide treatments, changes to grazing, or other approaches—to be restored, if they can be restored at all. A Worksite in the West The team used around 6 million acres in southwestern New Mexico for the study. This area features large expanses of public and private land with desert grassland, savanna, and shrubland. Native shrubs have been encroaching on areas previously covered by perennial grasses, and erosion has degraded soils throughout much of the region. The researchers started developing three ecological-state categories for plant communities by defining how woody-cover density varies among different soils. They determined this by identifying the vegetation they believed had historically dominated a particular soil. The categories were “little woody cover,” “significant woody plant cover within a grassland matrix,” and “dominated by woody plants. ...|$|R
