25|$|From a distance, the drakes in nuptial plumage appear grey, {{with a dark}} head, a {{yellowish}} behind, and a white stripe {{running along}} the flanks. Their head and upper neck is chestnut, with a wide and iridescent dark green patch of half-moon- or teardrop-shape that starts immediately before the eye and arcs to the upper hindneck. The patch is bordered with thin yellowish-white lines, and a single line of that colour extends from the patch's forward end, curving along {{the base of the}} bill. The breast is buff with small round brown spots. The center of the belly is white, {{and the rest of the}} body plumage is mostly white with thin and dense blackish vermiculations, appearing medium grey even at a short distance. The outer scapular feathers are white, with a black border to the outer vanes, and form the white side-stripe when the bird is in resting position. The primary remiges are dark greyish brown; the speculum feathers are iridescent blackish-green with white tips, and form the speculum together with the yellowish-white tips of the larger upperwing coverts (which are otherwise grey). The underwing is whitish, with grey remiges, dense dark spotting on the inner coverts and a dark leading edge. The tail and tail coverts are black, with a bright yellowish-buff <b>triangular</b> <b>patch</b> in the center of the coverts at each side.|$|E
25|$|The bird is shiny blue-black {{with white}} {{markings}} on its neck {{and back and}} extensive white on {{the trailing edge of}} both the upper- and underwing. The underwing is also white along its forward edge, resulting in a black line running along the middle of the underwing, expanding to more extensive black at the wingtip. In adults, the bill is ivory in color, and chalky white in juveniles. Ivory-bills have a prominent crest, although in juveniles it is ragged. The crest is black in juveniles and females. In males, the crest is black along its forward edge, changing abruptly to red on the side and rear. The chin of an ivory-billed woodpecker is black. When perched with the wings folded, birds of both sexes present a large patch of white on the lower back, roughly triangular in shape. These characteristics distinguish them from the smaller and darker-billed pileated woodpecker. The pileated woodpecker normally is brownish-black, smoky, or slaty black in color. It also has a white neck stripe, but the back is normally black. Pileated woodpecker juveniles and adults have a red crest and a white chin. Pileated woodpeckers normally have no white on the trailing edges of their wings and when perched, normally show only a small patch of white {{on each side of the}} body near the edge of the wing. However, pileated woodpeckers, apparently aberrant individuals, have been reported with white trailing edges on the wings, forming a white <b>triangular</b> <b>patch</b> on the lower back when perched. Like all woodpeckers, the ivory-billed woodpecker has a strong and straight bill and a long, mobile, hard-tipped, barbed tongue. Among North American woodpeckers, the ivory-billed woodpecker is unique in having a bill whose tip is quite flattened laterally, shaped much like a beveled wood chisel.|$|E

25|$|The sexes {{are very}} nearly alike, and the {{difference}} slight between the dry-season and wet-season broods. Upperside dull black thickly irrorated (sprinkled) with golden-green scales Forewing: a broad subterminal golden-green band that varies in length, but in all specimens {{is more or less}} diffuse and obsolescent towards the costal margin; in specimens of the wet-season broods this band is slightly broader than in those of the dry season, also broader in the female than in the male. Hindwing: the irroration of golden-green scales less dense, turning to blue on the anterior portions of the wing; a broad bright blue upper discal patch that stops well short of the termen, and has its outer margin uneven, occupies the base of interspace 4 and the outer portions of interspaces 5, 6, and 7; below, this patch is continued in interspaces 1 to 3 by much smaller diffuse quadrate spots of brilliant golden-green scales, that are prominent in wet-season forms, more obscure in the dry. The discal patch itself is variable in size; in some specimens there is only a trace of it in interspace 4. Tornus with a conspicuous subterminal claret-red lunule, traversed inwardly by an obscure blue line and edged above the lunule, narrowly, by velvety black; indications generally of a similar lunule in interface 2; finally a terminal series of large velvety-black markings that form on the tail broad borders to the green irroration down its middle. Cilia broadly edged with white in the interspaces. Underside chocolate brown, somewhat thinly irrorated with yellowish scales, which are absent however, from a more or less <b>triangular</b> <b>patch</b> {{in the middle of the}} forewing posteriorly, but coalesce and form an ill-defined very short subterminal band just above the tornal angle of that wing. Hindwing: a conspicuous subterminal series of claret-red lunules each traversed inwardly by a line of purplish blue, followed by velvety-black spots and broad white terminal lunules. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen brownish black; the head, thorax and abdomen above, thinly irrorated with green scales.|$|E
25|$|The {{torpedo scad}} is a {{moderately}} large fish, growing {{to a maximum}} recorded length of 80cm and a weight of 4 kg, however is more common between 30 and 40cm length. It is rare at lengths greater than 80cm. The species is often considered to have a rather unusual body form, having features superficially similar to tunas, mackerels and other carangids. The body is elongate and subcylindrical, becoming highly compressed toward the tail and caudal fin, with a marked median keel on the caudal peduncle. The dorsal and ventral profiles of the fish are nearly evenly , with the two profiles intersecting at the pointed snout. There are two separate dorsal fins; the first consisting of 8 moderately high spines and the second of a single spine followed by 18 to 20 soft rays. The anal fin consists of two anteriorally detached spines followed by a single spine attached to 16 or 17 soft rays. In both the dorsal and anal fins, the posterior 7-10 rays are detached and form a series of diagnostic finlets. The pectoral fin is strongly falcate (scythe shaped), and extends beyond {{the origin of the}} second dorsal fin. The lateral line is strongly arched over a short length anteriorly, with the intersection of the curved and straight sections vertically below the fourth or fifth spine of the first dorsal fin. The curved section of the lateral line has 21 to 29 scales, while the straight section has 51 to 59 very large scutes. The breast is devoid of scales in a <b>triangular</b> <b>patch</b> to about one-third the distance to the pectoral fin base. The eye has a well-developed adipose eyelid which nearly completely covers the eye. The upper jaw contains small villiform teeth, with some outer teeth moderately enlarged, while the lower jaw has a single row of small teeth. There are 26 to 32 gill rakers and 24 vertebrae.|$|E
25|$|The Union {{artillery}} fire was lifted as Meade's men moved forward around 1 p.m. Jackson's force of about 35,000 remained concealed on the wooded ridge to Meade's front. His formidable defensive line had an unforeseen flaw. In A.P. Hill's division's line, a <b>triangular</b> <b>patch</b> {{of the woods}} that extended beyond the railroad was swampy and covered with thick underbrush and the Confederates had left a 600-yard gap there between the brigades of Brig. Gens. James H. Lane and James J. Archer. Brig. Gen. Maxcy Gregg's brigade stood about a quarter mile behind the gap. Meade's 1st Brigade (Col. William Sinclair) entered the gap, climbed the railroad embankment, and turned right into the underbrush, striking Lane's brigade in the flank. Following immediately behind, his 3rd Brigade (Brig. Gen. Feger Jackson) turned left and hit Archer's flank. The 2nd Brigade (Col. Albert L. Magilton) came up in support and intermixed with the leading brigades. As the gap widened with pressure on the flanks, thousands of Meade's men {{reached the top of}} the ridge and ran into Gregg's brigade. Many of these Confederates had stacked arms while taking cover from Union artillery and were not expecting to be attacked at that moment, so were killed or captured unarmed. Gregg at first mistook the Union soldiers for fleeing Confederate troops and ordered his men not to fire on them. While he rode prominently in front of his lines, the partially deaf Gregg could not hear the approaching Federals or their bullets flying around him. In the confusion, a bullet struck his spine and fatally wounded him; he died two days later. Col. Daniel Hamilton of the 1st South Carolina assumed command, but Gregg's brigade was totally routed and was no longer an organized unit for the rest of the day. James Archer meanwhile was being pressed hard on his left flank and sent word for Gregg to reinforce him, unaware that he had been shot and his brigade had disintegrated. The 19th Georgia's flag was captured by the adjutant of the 7th Pennsylvania Reserves; it was the only Confederate regimental flag captured and retained by the Army of the Potomac in the battle. The Georgians broke and ran. The 14th Tennessee resisted the onslaught for a time before also breaking; a sizable number of its men were taken prisoner. Archer frantically sent messages to the rear, calling on John Brockenbrough and Edmund Atkinson's brigades for help. With ammunition on both sides running low, hand-to-hand fighting ensued with soldiers stabbing at each other with bayonets and using muskets as clubs. Most of the regimental officers on both sides went down as well; on the Confederate side, the 1st Tennessee went through three commanders in a matter of minutes. Meade's 15 regiments also lost most of their officers, although Meade himself survived the battle unscathed despite being exposed to heavy {{artillery fire}}.|$|E

They are maps of triangular domains into R cubed, where the patches are described by control nets similar to the rectangular case. One difference in the definition of surface normals at the patch corners: rectangular patches have inherent problems with so-called degenerate corners, i. e., edges collapsing into one point. <b>Triangular</b> <b>patches</b> do not have these problems. Since triangular shapes arise rather frequently in the design of complicated surfaces (e. g., interior car body panels), it seems that for such surfaces <b>triangular</b> <b>patches</b> are a promising addition to the usually employed rectangular patches. Another major application is the formulation of interpolants to solve the scattered data problem: here Bernstein-Bezier patches provide a very powerful tool; they can be used to discover new schemes as well as to discover new properties of existing methods...|$|R

Since {{the intersection of}} (for example) two bicubic tensor-product surface patches is not a rational curve, it is usually described by approximations in the parameter domain of each surface. If these approximations are employed as “trim curves”, their images in R 3 do not agree precisely, and the resulting trimmed surfaces may exhibit “gaps ” and “overlaps ” along their common edge, an artifact that often incurs failure of downstream applications.
