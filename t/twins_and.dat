5|$|Although Clinch {{believed}} that the evidence pointed to the twins having genuinely existed but that they {{had lived in the}} 16th century, rather than the early 12th century as generally claimed, they are not mentioned in any journals or books from the period. This points against their having lived in the 16th century; the case of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo (1617– after1646) had prompted great interest in conjoined <b>twins,</b> <b>and</b> conjoined sisters surviving to adulthood in south east England would have been widely noted.|$|E

40|$|In their {{original}} article, Burt and Simons (2014) argued that heritability studies should be abandoned because <b>twin</b> <b>and</b> adoption research is a fatally flawed paradigm. They pointed optimistically to epigenetics research {{as the way}} forward. In our view, both rec-ommendations are hasty. This commentary will put forward two contrarian opinions. First, <b>twin</b> <b>and</b> adoption studies {{still have a lot}} to offer criminologists who seek the social causes of crime. Second, epigenetics research has very little to offer yet for criminologists who seek the social causes of crime. WHAT CAN <b>TWIN</b> <b>AND</b> ADOPTION RESEARCH OFFER CRIMINOLOGISTS? <b>Twin</b> <b>and</b> adoption studies are informative about environmental crime causation. In 2005, Terrie E.

5|$|At the Middle Preclassic city of Nakbe in {{the central}} lowlands, Maya sculptors were {{producing}} {{some of the earliest}} lowland Maya stelae, depicting richly dressed individuals. Nakbe Stela1 has been dated to around 400BC. It was broken into pieces, but originally represented two elaborately dressed figures facing each other, and perhaps represents the transference of power from one ruler to his successor, however it also has features that recall the myth of the Maya Hero <b>Twins,</b> <b>and</b> would be the earliest known presentation of them. Around 200BC the enormous nearby city of ElMirador had started to erect stela-like monuments, bearing inscriptions that appear to be glyphs but that are so far unreadable. Stela dating to the Late Preclassic period are also known from the sites of El Tintal, Cival, and San Bartolo in Guatemala, and Actuncan and Cahal Pech in Belize.|$|E

During this time, he isolated himself and abstained from {{contact with the outside}} world. Cuomo also received braces on his teeth, further damaging his self-esteem. Bell would occasionally visit Cuomo and play songs with him. In turn, Cuomo would eventually reveal songs he was working on to Bell.|$|E
5|$|Ernest's {{position}} was often linked {{to his brother}} Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria. The two boys were raised as though <b>twins,</b> <b>and</b> became closer upon the separation and divorce of their parents, {{as well as the}} eventual death of their mother. The princes' relationship experienced phases of closeness as well as minor arguments as they grew older; after Albert's death in 1861, Ernest became gradually more antagonistic to Victoria and her children, as well as increasingly bitter toward the United Kingdom, publishing anonymous pamphlets against various members of the British royal family. Despite their increasingly differing political views and opinions however, Ernest accepted his second eldest nephew Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as his heir-presumptive. Upon Ernest's death on 22 August 1893 at Reinhardsbrunn, Alfred succeeded to the ducal throne.|$|E

Scenes containing actor and politician Napoleon as the historical figure Thalaiyoor Kaali were shot there first. Thereafter, scenes featuring Jayaram and Kushboo were filmed, portraying characters which were considerably younger {{than they are}} in real life. Prashanth revealed that portraying a dual role meant that he was forced to change his costumes up to forty times a day in order portray the twin brothers' differences correctly.

He made his major league debut with Pittsburgh on September 22, 2009, and pitched in three games for them that season. He signed with the Giants in the offseason and spent the entire 2010 season in the minor leagues. In 2011, he signed with the <b>Twins</b> <b>and</b> {{appeared}} in two games with them.

Her coach is still upset about her decision to marry, but Kom makes a comeback in the National Boxing Championship. Despite performing better than her opponent, she loses the match due to the apparent partiality of the judges. Kom throws a chair in anger towards them, resulting in a ban.

5|$|MS is not {{considered}} a hereditary disease; however, a number of genetic variations {{have been shown to}} increase the risk. Some of these genes appear to have higher levels of expression in microglial cells than expected by chance. The probability of developing the disease is higher in relatives of an affected person, with a greater risk among those more closely related. In identical twins both are affected about 30% of the time, while around 5% for non-identical <b>twins</b> <b>and</b> 2.5% of siblings are affected with a lower percentage of half-siblings. If both parents are affected the risk in their children is 10 times that of the general population. MS is also more common in some ethnic groups than others.|$|E
5|$|Nicholas Newman is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. Created and introduced by William J. Bell, {{he was born}} onscreen in 1988 as the second child of supercouple characters Victor and Nikki Newman. Portrayed {{by a set of}} <b>twins</b> <b>and</b> later two child actors for his first six-year period, the writers of the series decided to rapidly age the character to a teenager in the summer of 1994. That June, Joshua Morrow began portraying Nick, and has remained in the role to present time. The character was reintroduced with the purpose of developing a relationship with another character, Sharon Collins, who was introduced around the same story arc. The pairing, which yielded three children, Cassie, Noah and Faith Newman, proved popular with viewers. They are regarded as a prominent supercouple by the soap opera media.|$|E

5|$|The Maudsley–Bethlem {{study also}} {{hypothesized}} that schizophrenia {{was caused by}} a mixture of many small traits working together. These endophenotypes could be used for diagnosis. Endophenotypes have been interpreted as a link between genes and the final behavior, acted on by the environment and chance elements, with biochemical and epigenetic influences changing the genome but not being passed on to children. Molecular-biological studies in genetics have referred to endophenotypes to explain genetic causes of psychopathology. The researchers also examined how schizoids, those with mild, schizophrenia-like personality disorders, were linked to schizophrenics. Gottesman and Shields extended the term to classes of mild psychological disorders in <b>twins</b> <b>and</b> relatives of schizophrenics. The researchers had hypothesized that schizoida in a twin was how a schizophrenia carrier gene, one in a non-schizophrenic still passing on a genetic risk, expressed itself. The twin study did not confirm this.|$|E
