5|$|Among {{the many}} homologies in mammal {{reproductive}} systems, ovaries and <b>testicles</b> are homologous.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{disorder}} in male Pomeranians is cryptorchidism. This is when either {{one or both}} of the <b>testicles</b> do not descend into the scrotum. It is treated through surgical removal of the retained testicle.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{reproductive}} organs include <b>testicles</b> and ovaries. In most species, gonads are paired organs of similar size, {{which can be}} partially or totally fused. There {{may also be a}} range of secondary organs that increase reproductive fitness.|$|E
40|$|A male one year-old beagle {{dog with}} {{unilateral}} cryptorchism was presented for investigation of reduced appetite. Abdominal sonography and radiography demonstrated abnormal {{enlargement of the}} left <b>testicle</b> in the abdominal cavity. Both the retroperitoneal cryptorchid <b>testicle</b> and the other contralateral <b>testicle</b> were removed surgically. The retroperitoneal cryptorchid <b>testicle</b> was an enlarged, firm and bulging sphere mass. The cut surface revealed a homogeneous white color. The contralateral <b>testicle</b> in the scrotum showed an almost normal appearance. Histopathologically, the retroperitoneal cryptorchid <b>testicle</b> was diagnosed as a Sertoli cell tumor.

50|$|Epididymitis is {{a medical}} {{condition}} characterized by inflammation of the epididymis, a curved structure {{at the back of}} the <b>testicle.</b> Onset of pain is typically over a day or two. The pain may improve with raising the <b>testicle.</b> Other symptoms may include swelling of the <b>testicle,</b> burning with urination, or frequent urination. Inflammation of the <b>testicle</b> is commonly also present.|$|R
5|$|Abnormal genitalia: usually {{cryptorchidism}} (retention of <b>testicles</b> in body) or monorchism (single testicle). In female patients, this presents {{as missing}} or single ovaries, much harder by nature to detect. Ultrasound imaging is performed at regular intervals, {{from the age}} of 1 year, to determine if ovaries are present.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, other doctors were also experimenting with gland transplantation, {{including}} Serge Voronoff, {{who had become}} known for grafting monkey <b>testicles</b> into men. In 1920, Voronoff demonstrated his technique before several other doctors {{at a hospital in}} Chicago, at which Brinkley showed up uninvited. Though Brinkley was barred at the door, his appearance elevated his profile in the press, which eventually resulted in his own demonstration at a hospital in Chicago. Brinkley transplanted goat <b>testicles</b> into 34 patients, including a judge, an alderman, a society matron and the chancellor of the now-defunct Chicago Law School (not {{to be confused with the}} University of Chicago Law School), all while the press looked on. His public profile grew, and his gland business in Milford continued at a brisk pace.|$|E
5|$|In any case, the {{restoration}} of the Eye of Horus to wholeness represents the return of the moon to full brightness, the return of the kingship to Horus, and many other aspects of maat. Sometimes {{the restoration}} of Horus's eye is accompanied by {{the restoration of}} Set's <b>testicles,</b> so that both gods are made whole near the conclusion of their feud.|$|E
40|$|Macroscopica nd {{microscopic}} {{changes of}} the <b>testicle</b> du e to various mechanical injuries have been studied on mice. The most remark a ble change of the <b>testicle</b> has been observed when both internal spermatic artery and vein have been simultaneously ligated. Ligation of the internal spermatic artery alone resulted in only slight {{changes of the}} <b>testicle</b> {{and it is not}} likely that simultaneous ligation of the both external spermatic artery and vein produced marked changes in the <b>testicle.</b> Moderate atrophy of the <b>testicle</b> was observed a month after simultaneous ligation of the both deferential artery and vein. Ligation of the spermatic cord, exposure of the <b>testicle,</b> retained testis, cranial injury, and ligation of lymph vessel resulted in marked changes in the <b>testicle.</b> Histologically a study of alkali- p hosphatase did not show consistent results which was probably due to the location of the <b>testicle.</b> The height of protein wave on poralogram of the testicular tissue fluid did not change significantly at 24 hours after the ligation...|$|R
40|$|Bilobed <b>testicle</b> is a {{very rare}} {{congenital}} malformation with an unknown etiology. Herein, we report an 18 -year-old boy presented with a right-bilobed <b>testicle</b> mimicking a testicular tumor. The present case {{highlights the importance of}} considering bilobed <b>testicle</b> as a valuable differential diagnosis of testicular mass to prevent unnecessary surgery. Furthermore, the case could provide more information about presentation and management of bilobed <b>testicle...</b>|$|R
50|$|An undescended <b>testicle</b> is not {{a serious}} or {{life-threatening}} condition, though it may cause the animal discomfort at times. This condition can be corrected by surgery to place the <b>testicle</b> in the correct position, but most ridglings are gelded to remove the <b>testicle</b> altogether.|$|R
5|$|Males mature {{at around}} 15years of age, {{by which time}} they have fully descended <b>testicles</b> and can reproduce. However, they exhibit arrested {{development}} by not developing the distinctive cheek pads, pronounced throat pouches, long fur, or long-calls until they are between 15 and 20years old. The development of these characteristics depends largely on {{the absence of a}} resident male.|$|E
5|$|New {{state laws}} prohibiting fast food {{restaurants}} in low-income neighborhoods {{result in the}} closure of all KFC eateries in Colorado, much {{to the dismay of}} Cartman, who is addicted to the food. When Randy Marsh learns that South Park's KFC outlet is now a medical marijuana dispensary, he attempts to give himself cancer so he can get a doctor's referral for marijuana after first gaining {{a clean bill of health}} from his doctor since he had assumed permits are given to the healthy. By irradiating his groin with a microwave oven, Randy successfully gives himself testicular cancer, making his <b>testicles</b> so large that he has to use a wheelbarrow to carry them. Randy obtains his medical referral and starts smoking marijuana regularly. Meanwhile, his <b>testicles</b> continue to grow to the point that he uses them as a space hopper for movement. Randy finds that larger <b>testicles</b> are attractive to women, including his wife, Sharon Marsh, so he encourages his friends to also get testicular cancer. The local doctor, unaware of the men's self-irradiation, becomes convinced that a recent change in South Park is responsible for the cancer outbreak.|$|E
5|$|In {{developmental}} biology, organs {{that developed}} in the embryo {{in the same manner}} and from similar origins, such as from matching primordia in successive segments of the same animal, are serially homologous. Examples include the legs of a centipede, the maxillary palp and labial palp of an insect, and the spinous processes of successive vertebrae in a vertebral column. Male and female reproductive organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the ovaries and <b>testicles</b> of mammals including humans.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{treatment}} for testicular cancer is {{surgery to remove}} the affected <b>testicle</b> (orchiectomy). While it may be possible, in some cases, to remove testicular cancer tumors from a testis while leaving the testis functional, this is almost never done, as the affected <b>testicle</b> usually contains pre-cancerous cells spread throughout the entire <b>testicle.</b> Thus removing the tumor alone without additional treatment greatly increases the risk that another cancer will form in that <b>testicle.</b>|$|R
40|$|An eight-year-old boy was {{admitted}} to our hospital with the chief complaint of pain and swelling of the left inguinal <b>testicle</b> which had occurred 4 days earlier. Surgical findings revealed 180 degrees clockwise rotation of the <b>testicle,</b> and necrosis of the <b>testicle</b> and epididymis, and then left orchidectomy was performed. The post-operative diagnosis was torsion of the undescended <b>testicle</b> with hemorrhagic infarction. We discussed on the pre-operative diagnosis and the treatment of this disease...|$|R

5|$|Promiscuity, {{in which}} {{both males and females}} mate with {{multiple}} partners, also occurs in rodents. In species such as the white-footed mouse, females give birth to litters with multiple paternities. Promiscuity leads to increased sperm competition and males tend to have larger <b>testicles.</b> In the Cape ground squirrel, the male's testes can be 20 percent of its head-body length. Several rodent species have flexible mating systems that can vary between monogamy, polygyny and promiscuity.|$|E
5|$|Robben did {{not make}} his {{competitive}} debut for Chelsea until November 2004, as he was injured in a pre-season friendly match against Roma, breaking a metatarsal bone in his right foot in a challenge from Olivier Dacourt. During this time, he told club doctors that he had noticed an unfamiliar growth {{on one of his}} <b>testicles.</b> The medical team quickly did tests to check for testicular cancer, but he was subsequently given the all clear.|$|E
5|$|Sigurður {{has used}} a variety of {{techniques}} to preserve the penises, including preservation in formaldehyde, pickling, drying, stuffing and salting. One particularly large penis taken from a bull has been converted into a walking stick. Many of the museum's exhibits are illuminated by lamps made by Sigurður from rams' <b>testicles.</b> Sigurður has also carved wooden phalluses, which can be found adorning various objects around the museum, and has a bow tie decorated with images of phalluses that he wears on special occasions.|$|E
50|$|In {{the male}} fetus, the {{peritoneum}} gives a coat to the <b>testicle</b> {{as it passes}} through this ring, forming a temporary connection called the processus vaginalis. In normal development, the processus is obliterated once the <b>testicle</b> is completely descended. The permanent coat of peritoneum that remains around the <b>testicle</b> is called the tunica vaginalis. The <b>testicle</b> remains connected to its blood vessels and the vas deferens, which make up the spermatic cord and descend through the inguinal canal to the scrotum.|$|R
40|$|Senior seminar (D. V. M.) [...] Cornell University, 2003. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 8). Maplewood Rusty was a {{two year}} old male Clydesdale horse that {{presented with a}} chief complaint of stallion-like behavior following removal of the right <b>testicle,</b> which {{was the only one}} that had descended. Physical exam revealed a healthy horse, and a left <b>testicle</b> that could not be palpated. Laparoscopy was performed to remove the abdominally cryptorchid <b>testicle,</b> and a large cystic structure associated with the <b>testicle</b> was found. 3. 5 liters of clear yellow fluid were drained off the cyst to allow removal of the <b>testicle.</b> The <b>testicle</b> was submitted for histopathology, which revealed a mix of testicular, neuronal, salivary, and thyroid tissues. Histologic diagnosis was testicular teratoma. Recovery from surgery was normal, and long term prognosis is excellent. Dr. Christopher Beinlic...|$|R
2500|$|As {{early as}} 330 BC, Aristotle {{prescribed}} the ligation (tying off) {{of the left}} <b>testicle</b> in men wishing to have boys. In the Middle Ages, men who wanted a boy sometimes had their left <b>testicle</b> removed. This was because people believed that the right <b>testicle</b> made [...] "boy" [...] sperm and the left made [...] "girl" [...] sperm.|$|R
5|$|The gesture {{dates back}} to Ancient Greece {{and it was also}} used in Ancient Rome. Historically, it {{represented}} the phallus. In some modern cultures, it has gained increasing recognition as a sign of disrespect, and has been used by music artists (notably more common among hardcore punk bands and rappers), actors, celebrities, athletes, and politicians. Most still view the gesture as obscene. The index finger and ring finger besides the middle finger in more contemporary periods has been likened to represent the <b>testicles.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{reversible}} surgical method {{under investigation}} is reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG) {{which consists of}} injecting a polymer gel, styrene maleic anhydride in dimethyl sulfoxide, into the vas deferens. An injection with sodium bicarbonate washes out the substance and restores fertility. Another is an intravas device which involves putting a urethane plug into the vas deferens to block it. A combination of an androgen and a progestin seems promising, as do selective androgen receptor modulators. Ultrasound and methods to heat the <b>testicles</b> have undergone preliminary studies.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduation}} during 1989, Hamm {{enrolled at}} the University of Texas, {{where he was a}} member of the Upsilon Chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity. There, Hamm was arrested for participating with a violent hazing incident in November 1990. Mark Sanders was beaten with a paddle and a broom by other fraternity members, while Hamm was leading him with a hammer claw around Sander's <b>testicles</b> around the fraternity house; Sanders' clothes were also set afire. The incident resulted in the fraternity being shut down on campus. Hamm made a plea deal and completed probation under the terms of a deferred adjudication; the charges were dismissed during August 1995.|$|E
50|$|Treatment is by {{physically}} untwisting the <b>testicle,</b> if possible, {{followed by}} surgery. Pain {{can be treated}} with opioids. Outcomes depends on time to correction. If done within six hours it is often good, however, if delayed for 12 or more hours the <b>testicle</b> is typically not salvageable. About 40% of people require removal of the <b>testicle.</b>|$|R

5|$|Another {{important}} episode concerns mutilations {{that the}} combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's <b>testicles</b> and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes {{the eye is}} torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen Eye of Horus represents {{a wide variety of}} concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost <b>testicles</b> is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge {{in the form of the}} Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.|$|E
5|$|Despite a life {{filled with}} bad luck—having Tourette syndrome, {{being struck by}} lightning, and losing one of his <b>testicles</b> to cancer—Harvie remains optimistic, living out his own {{eccentric}} way of life. In one of the pivotal episodes of his life, Harvie sits in the park next to a statue of Horace while he hears the instructional Carpe diem, which inspires him to make many changes in his life, such as embracing nudism and embarking on daring rescue missions for animal rights. He marries Val, a nurse he meets in hospital, and they adopt a daughter, Ruby, who has deformed limbs due {{to the effects of}} thalidomide.|$|E
5|$|Most {{available}} berkelium toxicity data {{originate from}} research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% berkelium {{ends in the}} blood stream. From there, about 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20years), 0.035% to the <b>testicles</b> or 0.01% to the ovaries where berkelium stays indefinitely. The balance of about 10% is excreted. In all these organs berkelium might promote cancer, and in the skeletal system its radiation can damage red blood cells. The maximum permissible amount of berkelium-249 in the human skeleton is 0.4nanograms.|$|E
50|$|Epididymitis {{usually has}} a gradual onset. Typical {{findings}} are redness, warmth and {{swelling of the}} scrotum, with tenderness behind the <b>testicle,</b> away from the middle (this is the normal position of the epididymis relative to the <b>testicle).</b> The cremasteric reflex (elevation of the <b>testicle</b> in response to stroking the upper inner thigh) remains normal. This is a useful sign to distinguish it from testicular torsion. If there is pain relieved by elevation of the <b>testicle,</b> this is called Prehn's sign, which is, however, non-specific and is not useful for diagnosis.|$|R
5000|$|Testicular torsion is a {{surgical}} emergency that requires immediate intervention {{to restore the}} flow of blood. [...] If treated either manually or surgically within six hours, {{there is a high}} chance (approx. 90%) of saving the <b>testicle.</b> At 12 hours the rate decreases to 50%; at 24 hours it drops to 10%, and after 24 hours the ability to save the <b>testicle</b> approaches 0. About 40% of cases result in loss of the <b>testicle.</b> Common treatment for children is surgically sewing the <b>testicle</b> to the scrotum to prevent future recurrence (orchiopexy).|$|R
