40|$|Composite {{indices are}} being {{more and more}} used to measure multidimensional {{phenomena}} in social sciences. Considerable attention has been devoted {{in recent years to}} the methodological issues associated with index construction, such as non-compensability and comparability of the data over time. The aim {{of this paper is to}} compare two non-additive approaches: the Mazziotta–Pareto Index (MPI) and the Weighted Product (WP) method. The MPI is a nonlinear composite index that rewards the units with ‘balanced’ values of the individual indicators. The WP method implicitly penalizes the ‘unbalance’ and allows building, for each unit, two closely interrelated composite indices: a ‘static’ index for space comparisons and a ‘dynamic’ index for <b>time</b> <b>comparisons.</b> The MPI entails an equal weighting of the indicators, and only relative <b>time</b> <b>comparisons</b> are allowed. The indices based on the WP method give more weight to low values, and allow for both absolute and relative <b>time</b> <b>comparisons.</b> An application to indicators of well-being in the Italian regions in 2006 and 2011 is presented...|$|R

40|$|Two main {{objectives}} {{in time and}} frequency metrology are {{the realization of the}} SI unit of time, and the construction and dissemination of atomic time scales based on the SI second. This thesis is mainly concerned with the latter of the two and has investigated the characteristics of space geodetic <b>time</b> and frequency <b>comparison</b> methods. Furthermore, strategies have been developed that increase the accuracy and redundancy of <b>time</b> <b>comparisons</b> and reduce the latency between the time measurement process and the application of the results. International time keeping is a global effort resulting from the cooperation of many national partners. National Metrology Institutes use different space based systems to compare their local realizations of UTC, UTC(k) with each other and contribute with clock measurements to the formation of TAI. Time measurements with Global Navigation Satellite Systems, GNSS, are used with robust and powerful methods that are currently the dominant tool for <b>time</b> <b>comparisons</b> over long distances. The use of carrier phase observation allows users to exploit the full capabilities of GNSS. The nature of carrier phase ambiguities was studied and its effect on precise <b>time</b> <b>comparisons</b> was determined. This has resulted in the development of real-time methods that allow to determine relative time differences between receiver clocks with link instabilities in the order of one part in 1 e 15 for time intervals of one day. Distributed time scales are a means for increasing the redundancy in timekeeping by establishing a grid of national nodes with similar capabilities. For the accuracy of the necessary remote <b>time</b> <b>comparisons</b> the repeated calibration of the interconnecting time links is an essential exercise. Carrier phase observations are utilized in a novel method of a GNSS aided clock transport, which allows the calibration of time links with sub-nanosecond accuracy. When several link techniques are implemented, the combination of the links increases the accuracy and redundancy in <b>time</b> <b>comparisons</b> between the national nodes. Kalman filtering is used in a method that allows to combine multiple time links in real-time. Diversity of time and frequency transfer methods is important in order to avoid a dependence on a single technique. The capabilities of geodetic Very Long Baseline Interferometry, VLBI, have been studied as a possible alternative for comparisons over long distances. VLBI performs on a similar level as GNSS carrier phase, and together they can be used to improve the precision of the intercontinental frequency comparisons. In the future continuously operated geodetic VLBI has the potential to contribute to international time metrology...|$|R

50|$|To {{calculate}} {{the percentage of}} vehicles on <b>time,</b> <b>comparison</b> is needed with the timetable. A comparison is often completed for arrival time rather than departure time, but both are common. Departure times are normally more on-time than arrival times, as incidents and breakdowns occur that reduce the on time performance. When the comparison is made between the timetable, and the actual arrival or departure time, a rule is applied {{to determine how much}} of a deviation is permitted. For example, if a bus is 4 minutes 20 seconds late, a rules may be applied that a bus is only late when later than 5 minutes, so this service would be counted as on time. The choice of threshold for lateness is an important one, with a low threshold resulting in a lower on time performance statistic. A high threshold will result in more services on time, but may result in the managing corporation or government body being accused on not reporting correctly.|$|E
50|$|PMS {{algorithms}} {{are typically}} tested on random benchmark data generated as follows: Twenty strings each of length 600 are generated randomly from the alphabet of interest. The motif M is also generated randomly and planted {{in each of}} the input strings within a Hamming distance of d. The motif instances are also generated randomly. Certain instances of the (l, d)-motif problem have been identified to be challenging. For a given value of l, the instance (l, d) is called challenging if d is the smallest integer for which the expected number of (l, d)-motifs that occur by random chance (in addition to the planted one) is one or more. For example, the following instances are challenging: (9, 2), (11, 3), (13, 4), (15, 5), (17, 6), (19, 7), etc. The performance of PMS algorithms is customarily shown only for challenging instances.

40|$|Satellite-station two-way <b>time</b> <b>comparison</b> is {{a typical}} design in Beidou System (BDS) which is {{significantly}} different from other satellite navigation systems. As a type of two-way <b>time</b> <b>comparison</b> method, BDS time synchronization is hardly influenced by satellite orbit error, atmosphere delay, tracking station coordinate error and measurement model error. Meanwhile, single-way <b>time</b> <b>comparison</b> can be realized through the method of Multi-satellite Precision Orbit Determination (MPOD) with pseudo-range and carrier phase of monitor receiver. It is proved in the constellation of 3 GEO/ 2 IGSO that the radial orbit error can {{be reflected in the}} difference between two-way <b>time</b> <b>comparison</b> and single-way <b>time</b> <b>comparison,</b> and that may lead to a substitute for orbit evaluation by SLR. In this article, the relation between orbit error and difference of two-way and single-way <b>time</b> <b>comparison</b> is illustrated based on the whole constellation of BDS. Considering the all-weather and real-time operation mode of two-way <b>time</b> <b>comparison,</b> the orbit error could be quantifiably monitored in a real-time mode through comparing two-way and single-way time synchronization. In addition, the orbit error can be predicted and corrected in a short time based on its periodic characteristic. It is described in the experiments of GEO and IGSO that the prediction accuracy of space signal can be obviously improved when the prediction orbit error is sent to the users through navigation message, and then the UERE including terminal error can be reduced from 0. 1 m to 0. 4 m while the average accuracy can be improved more than 27 %. Though it is still hard to make accuracy improvement for Precision Orbit Determination (POD) and orbit prediction because of the confined tracking net and the difficulties in dynamic model optimization, in this paper, a practical method for orbit accuracy improvement is proposed based on two-way <b>time</b> <b>comparison</b> which can result in the reflection of orbit error...|$|E
