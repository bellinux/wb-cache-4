25|$|Syncaris pacifica is a ten-legged {{crustacean}} {{that employs}} a two-pronged approach to camouflage: {{it uses a}} technique of <b>translucency</b> coupled with strategically placed chromatophores, which occur internally {{as well as on}} the surface.

40|$|Most active scene {{recovery}} techniques {{assume that}} a scene point is illuminated only directly by the illumination source. Consequently, global illumination effects due to inter-reflections, sub-surface scattering and volumetric scattering introduce strong biases in the recovered scene shape. Our goal is to recover scene properties {{in the presence of}} global illumination. To this end, we study the interplay between global illumination and the depth cue of illumination defocus. By expressing both these effects as low pass filters, we derive an approximate invariant {{that can be used to}} separate them without explicitly modeling the light transport. This is directly useful in any scenario where limited depth-of-field devices (such as projectors) are used to illuminate scenes with global light transport and significant depth variations. We show two applications: (a) accurate depth recovery in the presence of global illumination, and (b) factoring out the effects of defocus for correct direct-global separation in large depth scenes. We demonstrate our approach using scenes with complex shapes, reflectances, textures and <b>translucencies.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} novel framework for automatic chroma keying and the optimizations for real-time and stereoscopic 3 D processing. It first simulates {{the process of}} human perception on isolating foreground elements in a given scene by perceptual analysis, and then predicts foreground colours and alpha map based on the analysis results and the restored clean background plate rather than direct sampling. Besides, an object level depth map is generated through stereo matching on a carefully determined feature map. In addition, three prototypes on different platforms have been implemented according to their hardware capability based on the proposed framework. To achieve real-time performance, the entire procedures are optimized for parallel processing and data paths on the GPU, as well as heterogeneous computing between GPU and CPU. The qualitative comparisons between results generated by the proposed algorithm and other existing algorithms show that the proposed one is able to generate more acceptable alpha maps and foreground colours especially in those regions that contain <b>translucencies</b> and details.

The aim of this study was to assess the relation between the surface hardness of seven different commercial brands of resin composites (Charisma, Fill Magic, Master Fill, Natural Look, Opallis, Tetric Ceram, and Z 250) and the different degrees of translucence (translucid, enamel and dentin). Vickers microhardness testing revealed significant differences among the groups. Z 250 was the commercial brand that showed the best performance in the hardness test. When comparing the three groups assessed within the same brand, only Master Fill and Fill Magic presented statistically significant differences among all of the different <b>translucencies.</b> Natural Look was the only one that showed no significant difference among any of the three groups.

40|$|Projectors are {{increasingly}} being used as light-sources in computer vision applications. In several applications, they are modeled as point light sources, thus ignoring the effects of illumination defocus. In addition, most active vision techniques assume that a scene point is illuminated only directly by the light source, thus ignoring global light transport effects. Since both defocus and global illumination co-occur in virtually all scenes illuminated by projectors, ignoring them can result in strong, systematic biases in the recovered scene properties. To make computer vision techniques work for general real world scenes, it is thus important to account for both these effects. In this paper, we study the interplay between defocused illumination and global light transport. We show that both these seemingly disparate effects can be expressed as low pass filters on the incident illumination. Using this observation, we derive an invariant between the two effects, {{which can be used}} to separate the two. This is directly useful in scenarios where limited depth-of-field devices (such as projectors) are used to illuminate scenes with global light transport and significant depth variations. We show applications in two scenarios: (a) accurate depth recovery in the presence of global light transport, and (b) factoring out the effects of illumination defocus for correct direct-global component separation.

To change colour, the animal distorts the sac by muscular contraction, changing its <b>translucency,</b> reflectivity or opacity.

500|$|Tooth {{abnormalities}} {{caused by}} environmental factors during tooth development have long-lasting effects. Enamel and dentin do not regenerate after they mineralize initially. Enamel hypoplasia {{is a condition}} in which the amount of enamel formed is inadequate. This results either in pits and grooves in areas of the tooth or in widespread absence of enamel. Diffuse opacities of enamel does not affect the amount of enamel but changes its appearance. Affected enamel has a different <b>translucency</b> {{than the rest of the}} tooth. Demarcated opacities of enamel have sharp boundaries where the <b>translucency</b> decreases and manifest a white, cream, yellow, or brown color. All these may be caused by nutritional factors, an exanthematous disease (chicken pox, congenital syphilis), undiagnosed and untreated celiac disease, hypocalcemia, dental fluorosis, birth injury, preterm birth, infection or trauma from a deciduous tooth. [...] Dental fluorosis is a condition which results from ingesting excessive amounts of fluoride and leads to teeth which are spotted, yellow, brown, black or sometimes pitted. In most cases, the enamel defects caused by celiac disease, which may be the only manifestation of this disease in the absence of any other symptoms or signs, are not recognized and mistakenly attributed to other causes, such as fluorosis. Enamel hypoplasia resulting from syphilis is frequently referred to as Hutchinson's teeth, which is considered one part of Hutchinson's triad. Turner's hypoplasia is a portion of missing or diminished enamel on a permanent tooth usually from a prior infection of a nearby primary tooth. Hypoplasia may also result from antineoplastic therapy.|$|E
