5|$|When Rovers were {{admitted}} to The Football League in 1920 they wore white shirts with blue shorts. These remained the team colours until 1930, when the colours were reversed to blue shirts and white shorts for one season. The {{blue and white}} quarters were first worn in 1931, when they were introduced to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> players look larger and more intimidating. Rovers continued to wear the quarters for 31 years until they were replaced by blue pinstripes on a white background.|$|E
5|$|The hunt of {{the pilot}} whale is known by the locals as the Grindadráp. There are no fixed hunting seasons. As soon as a pod close enough to land is spotted, the locals set out to begin the hunt, after {{approval}} from the sysselman. The animals are driven into a bay which is approved for whaling by the Faroese government, and then they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> whales to beach themselves. The only way out is being blocked off {{by some of the}} boats, which stay there until men who have been waiting on shore have slaughtered all the whales.|$|E

5|$|With the Winter Olympics {{being held}} in Canada, the writers wanted an Olympic-themed episode that could air during the Games. The script was written by Rob LaZebnik, who {{considered}} having the plot revolve around Homer competing in four-man bobsled. However, he decided a curling episode would allow for the plot to revolve around Homer and Marge. In order to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> depiction of curling in the episode accurate, the writers visited a curling club and tried the sport themselves. They also consulted {{with a number of}} curlers. The episode was directed by Chuck Sheetz, while sportscaster Bob Costas guest-starred in the episode.|$|E
5|$|Before 2000, MMA had {{a number}} of {{different}} rule sets, with each one differing in ruling on downward elbow strikes (12-6 elbows). In UFC 1, the first UFC event where there were very few rules, Kevin Rosier used 12-6 elbows on Zane Frazier. In 2000, the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts were drawn up to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> sport more mainstream. The meeting consisted of representatives of a number of major MMA organisations including Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), Pride Fighting Championships and International Fighting Championships (IFC) as well as doctors and referees in New Jersey, United States. In the meeting, doctors raised concerns about 12-6 elbows after seeing an IFC match where 12-6 elbows were used to the back of a fighter's head. One doctor argued that they could be life-threatening, and refused to sanction any set of rules that didn't prohibit them.|$|E
5|$|However, while {{pleasing}} to Riker's mind, the passionate dreams only worsen Riker's condition, as the virus feeds {{on the positive}} endorphins his brain is creating. Pulaski and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) therefore agree to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> machine evoke negative dreams instead. Thus Riker dreams of Lieutenant Tasha Yar's (Denise Crosby) death, or the apparent death of Deanna Troi's child (R. J. Williams). This has the desired effect, as the negative endorphins drive the virus away, but the endorphins are not strong enough. As a last resort, Pulaski uses the machine to evoke dreams of raw, primitive feelings of fear and survival. Thus Riker dreams of fighting the tar creature Armus (Mart McChesney), the alien-controlled Admiral Gregory Quinn (Ward Costello), and the Klingon officer Klag (Brian Thompson) on board the warship Pagh. Seeing that the raw emotions work best, Pulaski intensifies the dreams to come at a more rapid pace. This finally kills the virus and Riker recovers.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{development}} of Final Fantasy X, game scenario writer Kazushige Nojima {{was concerned about the}} relationship between the player and the main character in a Final Fantasy title and wanted to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> story easier to follow. Since the player and the main character find themselves in a new world, Nojima wanted Tidus' understanding of that world to track the player's progress in the game. Nojima felt that Tidus was the easiest character to draw {{in the first half of}} Final Fantasy X, because character and player learn about the storyline together. Nojima created a brief description of Tidus for character designer Tetsuya Nomura, and Nomura created a sketch for input from Nojima and other staff members. Nomura was asked to design Tidus differently from the game's theme so he would stand out. Movie director Hiroshi Kuwabara noted the difficulty the developers had in making Tidus and the other main characters realistic. The staff wanted to use an undead person as a playable character, and Tidus was meant to be that character. During Final Fantasy X development, however, Nojima saw a film with a similar idea for its protagonist. The role of an undead person was then given to a secondary character, Auron.|$|E

A spin bowler usually delivers the ball quite slowly and puts spin on the ball, causing it to turn at an angle while bouncing off the pitch.|$|E
25|$|France went onto beat Ireland {{in their}} second match, {{therefore}} clinching the trophy, however Scotland still played Ireland in Glasgow, the first meeting between these nations since 1995. The first half was to prove uneventful, with Ireland scoring a single <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> score 6–0 after 40 minutes. On the 46th minute Ireland drifted into a 10-point lead, but John Duffy kept the Bravehearts in the match with 20 minutes of the match remaining. Logan Campbell got a try for Scotland but then Ireland scored another, a drop-goal to win the match 17–10. Colin Wilson was awarded the Man of the Match award, and significantly became the first player from the Scottish Conference domestic league to represent Scotland.|$|E

He said their bodies were lying side by side, their heads resting on blankets. Byrne's body was dragged out of the hotel, but the bodies of Hart and Kelly were badly burned during the fire. People who saw the burned and blackened bodies were only able to tell which was Dan Kelly and which was Steve Hart by their size. They were placed on sheets of bark from a tree and photographed. Three Glenrowan people held hostage inside the hotel died during the siege.|$|E

25|$|In spring 1975, a {{group of}} South Moluccans were caught conspiring to steal a heavy truck and ram the gates of Soestdijk Palace to kidnap the queen. Ten {{members of the group}} were apprehended by the police in a vehicle full of fire arms; ten people were arrested. The group's alleged aim was to force the Dutch {{government}} to recognize the Republik Maluku Selatan (RMS) as an independent state and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> Indonesian government do the same. Seventeen South-Moluccan youngsters were tried and convicted and sentenced to up to 6 years imprisonment. This was {{one of a series of}} actions for this cause during the 1970s, including the 1975 Dutch train hostage crisis, the 1975 Indonesian consulate hostage crisis, the 1977 Dutch train hostage crisis, the 1977 Dutch school hostage crisis, and the 1978 Dutch province hall hostage crisis.|$|E
25|$|Just {{as he did}} {{two years}} before, Whymper asked Carrel to be his guide, but Carrel declined; Whymper was also {{unsuccessful}} in hiring other local guides from Breuil. When Whymper discovered Giordano and Carrel's plan, he left Breuil and crossed the Theodul Pass to Zermatt to hire local guides. He encountered Lord Francis Douglas, a Scottish mountaineer, who also wanted to climb the Matterhorn. They arrived later in Zermatt in the Monte Rosa Hotel, where they met two other British climbers — the Reverend Charles Hudson and his young and inexperienced companion, Douglas Robert Hadow — who had hired the French guide Michel Croz to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> first ascent. These two groups decided to join forces and try the ascent of the Hörnli ridge. They hired another two local guides, a father and son, both named Peter Taugwalder.|$|E
25|$|The color pink {{was chosen}} as the {{magazine}} that created the Giro, La Gazzetta dello Sport, printed its newspapers on pink paper. The pink jersey was added to the race in the 1931 edition and it has since become a symbol of the Giro d'Italia. The first rider to wear the pink jersey was Learco Guerra. Each team brings multiple pink jerseys in advance of the Giro in case one of their riders becomes the overall leader of the race. Riders usually <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> extra effort to keep the jersey {{for as long as possible}} in order to get more publicity for the team and the sponsor(s) of the team.

25|$|Two {{minutes into}} the second half, New Zealand's {{replacement}} centre Sonny Bill Williams offloaded the ball to Ma'a Nonu who beat a handful of Australian defenders to score a try, extending the lead to 21–3. In the 52nd minute, New Zealand fullback Ben Smith was sin-binned after tip-tackling Australia's Drew Mitchell. While Smith was in the sin-bin, Australia ran in two tries – the first to number eight David Pocock from a driving maul, and the second to centre Tevita Kuridrani following a kick to score. Foley converted both tries to bring Australia within four points with 16 minutes remaining. With 10 minutes left on the clock, Carter scored a drop goal from 40 metres {{to open up the}} gap to seven points. Several minutes later, New Zealand were awarded a penalty, with Carter converting long range to give New Zealand a 27–17 lead. Needing to score quick tries to stay in the match, Australia lost the ball, which was kicked ahead by Ben Smith, allowing Beauden Barrett to chase and score the clinching try.
