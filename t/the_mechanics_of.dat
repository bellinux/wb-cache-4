5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> the {{role-playing}} game {{system were}} created specifically for Bunnies & Burrows, common {{at the time}} of its original publishing.

5|$|An article {{published}} in 1997 reported research of <b>the</b> <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> Apatosaurus tails by Nathan Myhrvold and paleontologist Philip J. Currie. Myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail, which in diplodocids like Apatosaurus was a very long, tapering structure resembling a bullwhip. This computer modeling suggested sauropods were capable of producing a whiplike cracking sound of over 200 decibels, comparable to the volume of a cannon being fired.|$|E

5|$|Fukuda's {{training}} method consisted mostly {{of the student}} taking fall after fall for the teacher or senior student until he began to understand <b>the</b> <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> the technique. Fukuda stressed applied technique over ritual form. He gave beginners a short description of the technique and had them engage in free practice (randori) in order to teach through experience. It was only after the student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms (kata). This method was difficult, as there were no special mats for falling, only the standard straw mats (tatami) laid over wooden floors.|$|E

5|$|Some critics {{consider}} The Man in the Moone, {{along with}} Kepler's Somnium, {{to be one}} of the first works of science fiction. The book was well known in the 17th century, and even inspired parodies by Cyrano de Bergerac and Aphra Behn, but has been neglected in critical history. Recent studies have focused on Godwin's theories of language, <b>the</b> <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> lunar travel, and his religious position and sympathies as evidenced in the book.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, <b>the</b> <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> how dew {{condenses}} were much better understood. The key insight was that low-mass collectors which rapidly lose heat by radiation perform best. A number of researchers worked on this method. In the early 1960s, dew condensers made from sheets of polyethylene supported on a simple frame resembling a ridge tent were used in Israel to irrigate plants. Saplings supplied with dew and very slight rainfall from these collectors survived much better than the control group planted without such aids– they all dried up over the summer. In 1986 in New Mexico condensers made of a special foil produced sufficient water to supply young saplings.|$|E
5|$|Development of Shiny Festa {{began as}} a result of series {{producer}} Yōzō Sakagami's desire to create a video game that has a lighter feel and makes use of the franchise's songs that had not been featured in video game form. Shiny Festa original releases sold a total of 119,132 copies in its first week of release in Japan, and together ranked as the best-selling video game in Japan that week. The games were described by reviewers as accessible to the franchise's new and existing fans, but the iOS releases were criticized by journalists for their prohibitive pricing. <b>The</b> <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> Shiny Festa later reappear in The Idolmaster Shiny TV, a high-definition remastered version for the PlayStation 3.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Charles H. Zimmerman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) {{developed}} {{a system for}} control of a rotorcraft in which, with the rotors mounted {{on the underside of}} the aircraft, the machine could be steered by the pilot through the simple shifting of his weight, and kept stable through the actions of his natural reflexes. Known as kinesthetic control, and similar in principle to <b>the</b> <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> riding a bicycle or a surfboard, it was hoped that the concept would allow for pilots to operate an aircraft with little to no training time. NACA testing proved that the idea had merit, and several companies, including Bensen Aircraft, Hiller Aircraft, and de Lackner Helicopters, began development of rotorcraft using the concept.|$|E
5|$|Early {{conceptual}} {{designs of}} the Pod itself were based, as it {{existed in the}} novel, {{on one of the}} primary shapes in geometry, a dodecahedron, or a twelve-sided figure. Eventually the Pod was modified to a spherical capsule that encases the traveler. Zemeckis and the production crew also made several visits to the Kennedy Space Center at Merritt Island adjacent to Cape Canaveral, where officials allowed them access to sites off-limits to most visitors. Filmmakers were also brought onto Launch Complex 39 before the launch of the space shuttle. There, they concentrated on <b>the</b> <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> the elevator and the gantry area and loading arm. The resulting photographs and research were incorporated into the design of the machine's surrounding supports and gantry. Once the concept met with the filmmakers' approval, physical construction began on the sets for the Pod itself, the interior of the elevator, and the gantry, which took almost four months to build. The rest of the effects were compiled digitally by Imageworks.|$|E
5|$|I {{think it}} is {{important}} that people see that spirituality is at the base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn <b>the</b> <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Clouzot was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis and was sent first to Haute-Savoie and then to Switzerland, where he was bedridden for nearly five years in all. Clouzot's time in the sanatorium would be very influential on his career. While bedridden, Clouzot read constantly and learned <b>the</b> <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> storytelling to help improve his scripts. Clouzot also studied the fragile nature {{of the other people}} in the sanatorium. Clouzot had little money during this period, and was provided with financial and moral support by his family and friends. By the time Clouzot left the sanatorium and returned to Paris, World War II had broken out. French cinema had changed because many of the producers he had known had fled France to escape Nazism.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, a near-bankrupt TSR was {{purchased}} by Wizards of the Coast. Following three years of development, Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition was released in 2000. The new release folded the Basic and Advanced lines back into a single unified game. It was the largest revision of the D rules to date, and served {{as the basis for}} a multi-genre role-playing system designed around 20-sided dice, called the d20 System. The 3rd Edition rules were designed to be internally consistent and less restrictive than previous editions of the game, allowing players more flexibility to create the characters they wanted to play. Skills and feats were introduced into the core rules to encourage further customization of characters. The new rules standardized <b>the</b> <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> action resolution and combat. In 2003, Dungeons & Dragons v.3.5 was released as a revision of the 3rd Edition rules. This release incorporated hundreds of rule changes, mostly minor, and expanded the core rulebooks.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the view that}} science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified. A prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, <b>the</b> <b>mechanics</b> <b>of</b> the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.|$|E
