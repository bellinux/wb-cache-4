Exports to Quad countries of <b>tariff</b> <b>peak</b> products would expand by 30 - 60 %. Given that LDC exports of <b>tariff</b> <b>peak</b> items account for only a small share of total developing country exports, granting LDCs duty free access has a negligible impact on other developing countries.

Scenarios considered include the Girard's proposal (with alternative choices for the involved coefficient), the removal of <b>tariff</b> <b>peaks</b> and complete liberalisation. A special and differential treatment (SDT) for developing countries is also considered. Existing preferential trade arrangements are taken into account exhaustively, based on the MAcMap database, and tariff cuts are computed at the HS- 6 product level. In addition, in order to assess properly the context in which such liberalisation is likely to take place, a pre-experiment simulation is carried out, including the MFA, China and Russia accession to the WTO, and the extension of AGOA to all sub-Saharan African countries. The impact of these scenarios is finally assessed using MIRAGE, a CGE model incorporating imperfect competition used here in its static version.

40|$|Abstract: The {{power grid}} is aging and {{congested}} and faces new challenges and stresses that {{put at risk}} its ability to reliably deliver power to {{an economy that is}} increasingly dependent on electricity. A growing recognition of the need to modernize the grid to meet tomorrow’s challenges has found articulation in the vision of a Smart Grid. The essence of this vision is “a fullyautomated power delivery network that can ensure a two-way flow of electricity and information between the power plants and appliances and all points in between”. The three key technological components of the Smart Grid are distributed intelligence, broadband communications and automated control systems. It is considered that introduction of “Smart Grid ” technology will improve the reliability of power system, quality of supply, efficiency of the power sector apart from being consumer friendly and ultimately reduces line losses. Regardless of how quickly various utilities embrace smart grid concepts, technologies, and systems, they all agree on the inevitability of this massive transformation. Focusing in on the role of Smart Meters, this paper lays out the importance of time shifting the load to off-peak hours to avail the benefit of the proposed smart tariff which aims on cost reduction for consumers for operating during off-peak hours thereby improving the reliability of the whole network.

40|$|Although the EU imports raw {{materials}} from developing countries with zero or low tariffs, tariffs increase {{going up the}} value chain, according to a USDA GAIN Report. The reality of this tariff escalation, it maintains, citing the cases of rice and cocoa, is not compatible with the EU's proclaimed development objectives. Taking the example of rice, which is only included in the EBA to a limited degree until 2009, there is a 21 % increase in tariffs for husked rice versus paddy (rough) rice, and a 57 % increase if the rice is milled or semi-milled. This regime effectively limits semi-milled and milled rice imports into the EU to less than 20 % of total rice imports. The paper {{points out that in}} terms of rice imports from ACP countries the EU earns over € 10 million per annum in tariffs. What is more important is that it thereby inhibits the development of rice processing in ACP countries, with EU firms capturing the marketing margins on rice processing. 96 % of EU rice exports are of semi-milled or milled rice, and 45 % of the total go back to developing countries with the benefit of export refunds. With regard to cocoa the report notes a particular <b>tariff</b> <b>peak</b> on chocolate, arising partly from tariff escalation and partly from the supplementary duty charged, which is based on the sugar content of the chocolate. EBA countries (39 of which are also ACP) face no tariff escalation, but non-LDC ACP countries face a 12. 9 % duty, plus this supplementary sugar duty. The preferences extended to ACP countries have however encouraged more exports of cocoa paste and cocoa fat, butter and oil. Comment: The analysis contained in this report is based on the EU's standard GSP regime and {{does not take into account}} the EBA initiative established for least developed countries or the trade provisions of the Cotonou Agreement. It notes that duty-free access for rice is to be granted to LDC exporters by 2009, ending tariff escalation for these countries. However by that time, as a result of the implementation of rice-sector reforms, it is estimated that the European market price for rice will be 41 % below current levels. Such a market development would greatly undermine the value of the removal of tariff escalation. Although the EU imports {{raw materials}} from developing countries with zero or [...] ...|$|E

The aim is to show various ways in which tariffs on South African imports can be analysed such that DTI can develop in-house capacity to undertake such analysis on an on-going basis. A cursory comparison with earlier analysis suggests that tariffs have declined over the period 1997 - 2001, notably for manufacturing. However, further tariff liberalisation has been slow in last couple of years. <b>Tariff</b> <b>peaks</b> still exist {{for a number of}} broad categories of commodities such as processed foods (HS 0 - 2), vehicles and components thereof (HS 87), tobacco products (HS 24), rubber products (HS 40) and clothing and textiles (HS 6).

It basically, underlines Turkey’s unique negotiating position; de jure developing, de facto an advanced economy {{status in the}} WTO Doha NAMA negotiations. At Doha Ministerial Meeting in 2001, WTO members agreed to initiate negotiations to further liberalize trade, among other areas, on non-agricultural goods. For this purpose, the Negotiating Group on Market Access (NGMA) was created at {{the first meeting of}} the Trade Negotiations Committee of the WTO, in early 2002. Turkey has been quite active since then in NAMA negotiations in calibrating its position between offensive and defensive negotiation interests although its offensive market access interests largely outweigh defensive one. Turkey has also been propagating an offensive non-linear tariff cutting Swiss Formula approach at the WTO to curb the international high <b>tariffs,</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>peaks</b> and escalations. Having a strong offensive market access interests, Turkey mainly aims at large developing country markets diversifying its trade portfolio away from traditional markets towards large developing economies. From the perspective of governance, Turkey has serious constraints on its trade and industry policy space stemming from the Turkey-EU Customs Union (CU). Although Turkey is a de jure developing country in the WTO and will have all legal rights and mobligations stemming from the outcome of the DOHA, in practice, Turkey will have to implement the same applied common external tariffs of the EU. Despite the constraints and dilemmas stemming from the EU-Turkey customs union, it can be strongly argued that, it is in Turkey’s industrial interests to be actively involved in the WTO to tackle the high <b>tariffs,</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>peaks</b> and escalations which hinders Turkey’s exports to the world markets...|$|R

And most of the distor-tion traceable to agricultural policies is generated by import barriers. For that reason, negotiating wider market access in agriculture {{is critical to the}} success of the Doha Round. 1 The World Trade Organization (WTO) Agriculture Framework Agreement of July 2004 calls for significant tariff cuts using a tiered formula that imposes larger percentage cuts in higher tariffs.

This proposed approach is a vast improvement over the average-cut formula applied in the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture, which allows countries to meet their commitments through large proportional reductions in tariffs that were already low and small reductions in high tariffs.

This is because of the prevalence in agriculture of <b>tariff</b> <b>peaks</b> (a small number of tariff lines protect the bulk of domestic production), binding “overhang ” (bound tariffs are above applied tariffs), “water ” in the tariff (tariff reductions initially have no impact), and tariff escalation (higher tariffs o...|$|R

The assessment builds on an analysis of tariff-line data, with the application of possible tariff-reduction formulas. Particular attention is given to the implications of bindings above current applied rates (including unbound tariffs), {{as well as to the}} meaning of special and differential treatment in the context of actual application of tariff-reduction formulas. The resulting tariff rates from this exercise then serve as the basis for a set of CGE model scenarios. These scenarios in turn provide estimates of the impact of tariff reductions on developing countries in general, and LDCs in particular, and also on the high-income countries (basically the OECD Members). I have two sets of comments: one involves the importance of developing-country tariff liberalization for these countries; and a second involves the real scope for preference erosion. Developing-country tariffs matter for LDC market access One message from this study is that all the formulas yield larger cuts, in percentage terms, for the OECD countries, and larger cuts, in absolute terms, for developing countries (at least under the “ambitious ” scenarios). Admittedly, the OECD countries have <b>tariff</b> <b>peaks,</b> but focusing on the patter...|$|R
