This point may have influence on the effective <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> and consequently on the contact ratio, the length <b>of</b> the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> and the stress levels, which {{should be taken into}} account for calculation and standardization purposes.

40|$|Simple, {{traditional}} methods for computation of {{the efficiency of}} spur gears {{are based on the}} hypotheses of constant friction coefficient and uniform load sharing along the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact.</b> However, none <b>of</b> them is accurate. The friction coefficient is variable along the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact,</b> though average values can be often considered for preliminary calculations. Nevertheless, the nonuniform load sharing produced by the changing rigidity of the pair of teeth has significant influence on the friction losses, due to the different relative sliding at any contact point. In previous works, the authors obtained a nonuniform model of load distribution based on the minimum elastic potential criterion, which was applied to compute the efficiency of standard gears. In this work, this model of load sharing is applied to study the efficiency of both standard and high contact ratio involute spur gears (with contact ratio between 1 and 2 and greater than 2, resp.). Approximate expressions for the friction power losses and for the efficiency are presented assuming the friction coefficient to be constant along the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact.</b> A study <b>of</b> the influence of some transmission parameters (as the gear ratio, pressure angle, etc.) on the efficiency is also presented...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four papers, which treat the modelling of a spur gear set and a disc brake, and {{the interaction between the}} machine elements. Features of the performance are studied in relation to the initial stated assumptions. Initially, a method for analysing the influence of profile errors upon load-sharing capabilities and mesh stiffness of spur gears was proposed. The contacts between mating gear teeth were identified in the deformed state. In addition, artificial neural networks were employed for system identification. The discussion was focused upon the dependency between the contact ratio and the load in addition to the influence of profile and pitch errors. Experimental data validated the reliability of the approach. Following, a non-linear damping model for shaft torsional vibration studies was proposed and experimentally validated. The experiments showed that the internal shaft damping was highly non-linear. The damping tended to be not only stiffness related but also noticeably depended on the type of material. Friction induced noise due to the interaction of the mating teeth of a spur gear set was studied. For the shaft bearings, a non-linear damping model based upon the coefficient of restitution describing the interaction between the rolling elements and the inner- and outer race of the bearing was proposed. The non-linear support bearing model created a relation between the bearing stiffness in the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> <b>of</b> the mating teeth and the movement of the gears perpendicular to the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact.</b> The presence <b>of</b> friction had its greatest effect upon the bearing force in the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> <b>of</b> the mating gear teeth at low angular velocities, and at mesh frequencies close to the natural frequency of the vibration perpendicular to the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact.</b> Finally, the influence of the interaction between the disc of a floating disc brake assembly and connecting members was studied. In the initial process of the experimental research, high drag torque was acquired without applying force to the pads. The spline profile and the nave width were proven to have little effect upon drag, whilst the position on which the caliper was mounted had a considerable influence. Both the analytical study and the experimental measurements showed a strong correlation between the caliper position and the drag torque...|$|R

Instead of following a point-to-point analytical approach to the problem <b>of</b> determining the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> and the geometry of the generating rack and the mating wheel, the actual tooth flank {{is considered to be}} composed of infinitesimal local involutes and therefore a closed solution can be achieved. Due to its simplicity, the method is faster than the standard theory of gearing and this is particularly useful in problems requiring iterative calculations of the tooth geometry such as gear optimization. The method is implemented on modified involute as well as loboid gears used in lobe pumps and it is verified against existing theories. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{spiral bevel}} gears of attack {{helicopter}} transmission systems are taken as an object in this paper. The numerical analysis model for starved elastohydrodynamic lubrication (SEHL) of {{spiral bevel gears}} is established {{on the basis of}} the analysis <b>of</b> load tooth <b>contacts</b> analysis and SEHL in elliptical contacts. The SEHL characteristics of spiral bevel gears are also analyzed. The results are as follows: during the course of a gear-tooth meshing cycle of the spiral bevel gear, the extremum of minimal film thickness and maximal film pressure occurs near midpoint <b>of</b> the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact,</b> and leans to dedendum. The minimal value of the minimal film thickness is 0. 39 um, and the maximal value of the maximal film pressure is 0. 69 GPa. The value of minimal film thickness gradually increases with the increasing of meshing point velocity. When the velocity of meshing point exceeds 110 m/s, the increase became tardiness. As the load of meshing point increases, the value of minimal film thickness gently diminishes...|$|R
40|$|Low-light-level optical {{nonlinearities}} are of signiﬁcant {{interest for}} performing operations such as single-photon switching and quantum non-demolition measurements on single-photons. To evoke strong nonlinearities from singlephotons, one {{can enhance the}} matter-photon interaction using strongly nonlinear materials such as alkali vapors in combination with an appropriate geometry such as a waveguide, which provides a long interaction length while maintaining a small light mode area. We demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that such a system can be experimentally realized by loading rubidium vapor inside a hollow-core photonic band-gap ﬁber. Using the technique of light-induced atomic desorption in this geometry, we have generated optical depths greater than 1000. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) with control powers 1000 times lower than those used for hot vapor cells in a focused beam geometry. Working with such a high aspect ratio geometry requires us to identify and measure the various sources of decoherence via spectroscopy of desorbed atoms in the ﬁber. Using such techniques, we also estimate {{the temperature of the}} desorbing atoms inside the ﬁber. The desorption mechanism is studied, and we show that pulsed desorption beams of the right amplitude and duration can be used for generating precisely controlled optical depths. Finally, we investigate the use of various buffer gas techniques for increasing the effective <b>transverse</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> the atoms as they move across the ﬁber in order to reduce their ground state decoherence and map this effect as a function of buffer gas pressure...|$|R

In order to enhance the transmissible power level of the plastic spur gears, an arc-shaped tooth is designed, with variable height along the gear face width. There are two parameters that influence the tooth geometry: the radius of the generating point, defining the tooth curvature, and the tool axis inclination, leading to a tooth height variation. The paper deals with computerized design of the curved face width spur gear, as a replacement of the traditional numerical procedure, focused on tooth surface generation, contact analysis and stress calculation. The procedure enabled the correlation of the gear defining parameters such that interference could be avoided. The gears mesh simulation illustrated the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> geometry and enabled a proper load distribution for the finite element analysis.

The high elasticity of the ring, plane and the sungear often also causes an uneven distribution of the tooth forces. The present paper contributes to the calculation of theoretically predicted values of the tooth forces in planetary gears known from vehicle construction. A computer simulation of the dynamic behaviour determines the time dependent tooth forces and quantifies them according to DIN 3990 in form of the dimensionless load magnification coefficients K_#gamma#, K_v and K_#beta#.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{which can be}} used to calculate dynamic gear tooth force and bearing forces. The model includes elastic bearings. The gear mesh stiffness and the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> are determined using the deformations of the gears and the bearings. This gives contact outside the plane-of-action and a time-varying working pressure angle. In a numerical example it is found that the only important vibration mode for the gear contact is the one where the gear tooth deformation is dominant. The bearing force variation, however, will be much more affected by the other vibration modes. The influence of the friction force is also studied. The friction has no dynamic influence on the gear contact force or on the bearing force in the gear mesh line-of-action direction. On the other hand, the changing of sliding directions in the pitch point is a source for critical oscillations of the bearings in the gear tooth frictional direction. These bearing force oscillations in the frictional direction appear unaffected by the dynamic response along the gear mesh line-of-action direction. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. If {{the contact}} {{pressure}} between mating flanks of a gear set is increased, the {{lubricant film thickness}} in between is reduced to a level where the asperities of the flanks start to touch. This case where the surface roughness is of similar value as the EHD film thickness is called “mixed friction”. Due to the metallic <b>contact</b> <b>of</b> the asperities {{and the movement of}} the flanks with respect to each other, the flanks are damaged. The damaged flanks appear dull or greyish, hence the name “grey-staining” (or “Graufleckigkeit ” in German), see e. g. [4] or [1]. Micropitting are small cracks {{on the surface of the}} gears (as opposed to pitting, where the cracks form below the surface), which grow into the material. The size of the damages is about 10 - 20 µm depth, 25 - 100 µm length and 10 - 20 µm width. Micropitting is mainly observed with case carburized gears but may also be found in nitrided, induction hardened or through hardened gears.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the time course of}} synaptic differentiation, we made successive observations on identified, nerve-contacted muscle cells developing in culture. The cultures had either been stained with fluorescent alpha-bungarotoxin, or were maintained {{in the presence}} of a fluorescent monoclonal antibody. These probes are directed at acetylcholine receptors (AChR) and a basal lamina proteoglycan, substances that show nearly congruent surface organizations at the adult neuromuscular junction. In other experiments individual muscle cells developing in culture were selected at different stages of AChR accumulation and examined in the electron microscope after serial sectioning along the entire <b>path</b> <b>of</b> nerve-muscle <b>contact.</b> The results indicate that the nerve-induced formation of AChR aggregates and adjacent plaques of proteoglycan is closely coupled throughout early stages of synapse formation. Developing junctional accumulations of AChR and proteoglycan appeared and grew progressively, throughout a perineural zone that extended along the muscle surface for several micrometers on either side of the nerve process. Unlike junctional AChR accumulations, which disappeared within a day of denervation, both junctional and extrajunctional proteoglycan deposits were stable in size and morphology. Junctional proteoglycan deposits appeared to correspond to discrete ultrastructural plaques of basal lamina, which were initially separated by broad expanses of lamina-free muscle surface. The extent of this basal lamina, and a corresponding thickening of the postsynaptic membrane, also increased during the accumulation of AChR and proteoglycan along the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> nerve <b>contact.</b> Presynaptic differentiation <b>of</b> synaptic vesicle clusters became detectable at the developing neuromuscular junction only after the formation of postsynaptic plaques containing both AChR and proteoglycan.

40|$|Aluminium alloys {{suffer from}} {{localised}} attack termed exfoliation corrosion which is intergranular in nature where the attack proceeds around the elongated grains {{present in the}} microstructure. The formation of a more voluminous corrosion product than the original material results in the lifting of grains giving the characteristic of exfoliation corrosion - lamellar attack. This results in surface degredation {{in the form of}} pitting, flaking or blistering. The precipitates present within the microstructure and the grain shape can alter how susceptible the material is to exfoliation corrosion. The distribution of precipitates present can be altered by heat treatment which affects the exfoliation corrosion susceptibility. A study on the effects of heat treatment and grain shape on exfoliation corrosion has been completed for two AlCuMg alloys (2014 and 2024) and two aluminium - lithium alloys (8090 and 2091). A MASTMAASIS salt - spray cabinet was used to determine the exfoliation corrosion susceptibility of all the alloys. A four - point bend test was developed to determine the depth of penetration and compared to depths measured metallographically. The results for the 2 XXX series alloys suggest that as the grain aspect ratio increases the exfoliation susceptibility increases. Although the aspect ratio did not differ greatly between each alloy, the different phases present in the two alloys seem to contribute more markedly to the susceptibility. Heat treatment in the 2024 alloy suggested that the peak - aged condition gave a higher susceptibility to corrosion than the under - aged and over - aged conditions. Results indicated that the heat treatment has a greater effect on exfoliation corrosion than the grain aspect ratio, showing that the grain boundary microstructure {{is an important factor in}} the exfoliation process. The four - point bend test tended to underestimate the depth of attack by virtue of measuring the whole area of the specimen whereas metallographic measurements only took into account the attacked areas. End grain testing suggested that the attack can not only proceed longitudinally but also "short - circuit" down the <b>transverse</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> the elongated grains in the 2 XXX series alloys.

In Phase II mass transfer takes place until mass ratio reversal. Arguments are given in favor of such a process in pre-contact binaries. In Phase III an approximate evolutionary <b>path</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contact</b> binary is followed until a possible coalescence. AM loss, evolutionary effects of the components and mass transfer to the primary are taken into account. It is concluded that W UMa type binaries are old objects with secondaries in an advanced evolutionary stage, possibly with small helium cores. Both components fulfill the mass-radius relation for contact binaries while being in thermal equilibrium...|$|R
40|$|AMPA-type {{glutamate}} receptors (AMPARs) mediate fast neurotransmission at excitatory synapses. The {{extent and}} fidelity of postsynaptic depolarization triggered by AMPAR activation {{are shaped by}} AMPAR auxiliary subunits, including the transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs). TARPs profoundly influence gating, an effect thought to be mediated by an interaction with the AMPAR ion channel and ligand binding domain (LBD). Here, we show that the distal N-terminal domain (NTD) contributes to TARP modulation. Alterations in the NTD-LBD linker result in TARP-dependent and TARP-selective changes in AMPAR gating. Using peptide arrays, we identify a TARP interaction region on the NTD and define the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> TARP <b>contacts</b> along the LBD surface. Moreover, we map key binding sites on the TARP itself and show that mutation of these residues mediates gating modulation. Our data reveal a TARP-dependent allosteric role for the AMPAR NTD and suggest that TARP binding triggers a drastic reorganization of the AMPAR complex...|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} two contact {{structures on}} a homology sphere M, that are homotopic through 2 -plane fields, {{but are not}} isotopic as contact structures. A diffeomorphism of M permutes these two contact structures. In [LM] Lisca and Matić gave examples of homotopic but not isotopic contact structures. In this note we give a simple construction of another such example. Unlike the examples of Lisca and Matić, in our example the group of diffeomorphism of the 3 -manifold acts nontrivially on the set <b>of</b> <b>path</b> components <b>of</b> oriented <b>contact</b> structures <b>of</b> the manifold, while the action of this group is trivial on the set <b>of</b> <b>path</b> components <b>of</b> the oriented tangent plane distributions. Our construction <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> structures uses theorem of Y. Eliashberg, characterizing symplectic 4 -manifolds with pseudo-convex boundary (PC-manifolds). Theorem 1 ([E]) : Let X = B 4 ∪ (1 − handles) ∪ (2 − handles) be fourdimensional handlebody with one 0 -handle and no 3 - or 4 -handles. Then: • The standard PC structure on B 4 can be extended over 1 -handles so tha...|$|R
