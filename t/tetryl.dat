25|$|Remote {{burning of}} the {{explosive}}. Where possible, {{it is better to}} burn the explosive without detonation. Diethylene triamine (a close relative of ethylenediamine) reacts with TNT to generate heat. The compound that results from this reaction can then be combusted without detonation. It has been reported that this amine is hypergolic with TNT, <b>Tetryl,</b> Composition B and other TNT based explosives, but it does not react in the same way with RDX or PETN-based explosives. Other nitrogen-containing organic ligands (e.g. pyridine, diethylamine and pyrole) are known to be hypergolic with TNT.|$|E
25|$|The M34 was {{designed}} to hold 76 M125 bomblets, arranged in four groups of 19. Each bomblet held 2.6 pounds of the nerve agent sarin, and 8.8 ounces of the explosive <b>tetryl.</b> The ten pound cylindrical M125 bomblet also held an opening delay, fuze and parachute, {{as well as a}} burster, which contained the explosive. A M34 cluster bomb, fully loaded with M125 bomblets, had an agent weight to weapon weight ratio of 17 percent; the M34 and M125 were not the best delivery system. Eventually, cylindrical chemical bomblets, such as the M125, were supplanted by spherical models because they could obtain a greater coverage area.|$|E

50|$|The most toxic {{ordnance}} compounds, <b>tetryl</b> and 1,3,5-TNB, {{are also}} the most degradable. Therefore, these chemicals {{are expected to be}} short-lived in nature, and environmental impacts would not be expected in areas that are not currently subject to chronic inputs of these chemicals. <b>Tetryl</b> decomposes rapidly in methanol/water solutions, as well as with heat. All aqueous samples expected to contain <b>tetryl</b> should be diluted with acetonitrile prior to filtration and acidified to pH < 3. All samples expected to contain <b>tetryl</b> should not be exposed to temperatures above room temperature. In addition, degradation products of <b>tetryl</b> appear as a shoulder on the 2,4,6-TNT peak. Peak heights rather than peak areas should be used when <b>tetryl</b> is present in concentrations that are significant relative to the concentration of 2,4,6-TNT.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bursting}} charge of <b>tetryl</b> weighed 0.10 lb (45 g), and the alternate Composition [...] "A" [...] charge weighs 0.105 lb (48 g). The <b>tetryl</b> loading {{consisted of a}} 200 gr (13 g) <b>tetryl</b> pellet pressed into the shell cavity under 9,000-10,000 psi (60-70 MPa) pressure and {{the remainder of the}} charge of two equal increments pressed under approximately 9,000 psi (60 MPa) pressure. The Composition [...] "A" [...] {{bursting charge}} is loaded {{in the same manner as}} the <b>tetryl</b> charge, except that the relay pellet with the Composition [...] "A" [...] weighs 36 gr g as against 23 gr g for the pellet used with the <b>tetryl</b> load.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tetryl</b> {{was used}} mainly during World Wars I and II and later conflicts. <b>Tetryl</b> is usually used on its own, though can {{sometimes}} be found in compositions such as tetrytol. <b>Tetryl</b> is no longer manufactured or used in the United States, but can still be found in legacy munitions such as the M14 anti-personnel landmine.|$|E
50|$|Tetrytol {{is a high}} explosive, {{comprising}} {{a mixture}} of <b>Tetryl</b> and TNT-Tetryleutectic. Typically, the proportion of ingredients (by weight) is 65%, 70%, 75% or 80% <b>tetryl</b> to 35%, 30%, 25% or 20% TNT-Tetryleutectic. Tetrytol is more sensitive than <b>tetryl</b> and less sensitive than TNT. The detonation velocity of tetrytol is between 7310 and 7370 m/s {{with an average of}} 7340 m/s as opposed to TNT's detonation velocity of only 6900 m/s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tetryl</b> is {{a yellow}} {{crystalline}} solid powder material, practically {{insoluble in water}} but soluble in acetone, benzene and other solvents. When <b>tetryl</b> is heated, it first melts, then decomposes and explodes. It burns readily and is more easily detonated than ammonium picrate or TNT, being about as sensitive as picric acid. It is detonated by friction, shock, or spark. It remains stable at all temperatures which may be encountered in storage. It is generally used {{in the form of}} pressed pellets, and has been approved as the standard bursting charge for small-caliber projectiles, since it gives much better fragmentation than TNT. It also has greater brisance than any other military high explosive and has an explosive velocity of 23,600-23,900 feet per second (7200-7300 m/s). <b>Tetryl</b> is the basis for the service <b>tetryl</b> blasting caps necessary for positive detonation of TNT. A mixture of mercury fulminate and potassium chlorate is included in the cap to ensure detonation of <b>tetryl.</b>|$|E
50|$|Epidemiological {{data shows}} that <b>tetryl</b> has most {{effect on the}} skin, acting as a strong irritant. Symptoms of skin {{sensitization}} such as dermatitis, itch, erythema, etc. may occur. <b>Tetryl</b> can also affect mucous membranes, the upper respiratory tract, and possibly the liver.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tetryl</b> is a {{nitramine}} booster explosive, {{though its}} use {{has been largely}} superseded by RDX. <b>Tetryl</b> is a sensitive secondary high explosive used as a booster, a small charge placed next to the detonator in order to propagate detonation into the main explosive charge.|$|E

50|$|At first, {{picric acid}} {{was used as}} a booster to {{detonate}} TNT, though it was superseded due to the inherent danger of picrate formation. <b>Tetryl</b> replaced picric acid because it is more stable, and was once a very popular chemical for booster charges, particularly during World War II. However, since then <b>Tetryl</b> has largely been replaced by other compositions, e.g. a small cylinder or pellet of phlegmatized RDX (e.g. CH-6 or Composition A-5) or PETN (slightly larger than the actual detonator) into which the detonator itself is inserted.|$|E

50|$|In January 1942, the {{government}} formed a War Production Board began to expand powder and munitions production plants. In March 1942, a TNT plant was constructed. Other production plants included those for nitric acid, sulfuric acid and <b>tetryl.</b> Production continued until {{the war ended}} in 1945. By {{the end of the}} war, the complex covered 16273 acre containing 487 buildings, 24 residences, 50 mi of railroad track, and four complete water systems. Ultimately, the OOW produced more than 400000000 lb of smokeless powder and 90000000 lb of TNT and <b>tetryl.</b> Production ceased on August 16, 1945.|$|E
5000|$|Additional {{tests were}} done {{including}} the [...] "pendulum friction test", which measured a five-second explosion temperature of 263 °C to 290 °C. The minimum initiating charge required is 0.2 grams of lead azide or 0.1 grams of <b>tetryl.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although <b>tetryl</b> {{is among}} the most toxic {{explosive}} compounds, it is very short-lived. This combined {{with the fact that the}} health impacts of this compound are largely unstudied, not much is known about any health problems that this compound may cause.|$|E
50|$|After {{informing the}} local Pakistani embassy, Saif {{proceeded}} towards the American embassy on May 10. When he was scanned while entering, traces of TNT and <b>tetryl</b> {{were found in}} the documents and cell phone which he submitted at the reception. Some reports said residue was found on his body, but it was later determined that nothing had been found on his body, clothes and hands. While he was locked in the embassy building, hours before his official detention, Chilean police searched his apartment, finding no sign of any explosive residues. However, a second search later on the same day uncovered traces of <b>tetryl</b> on several items of clothing, a small suitcase and a laptop.|$|E
50|$|Kauffman's {{experience}} was at disarming explosives; now {{he and his}} teams were learning to use them offensively.

Primary explosives such as mercury fulminate were often used as a detonator, in combination with an explosive booster charge such as <b>tetryl.</b>|$|E
50|$|The M26A1 is an M26 {{that has}} the {{fragmentation}} coil redesigned to have a square rather than circular cross-section and has deeper serrations to aid in fragmentation. It also added a small <b>tetryl</b> booster charge on its fuze to completely detonate the explosive filler (displaced to 5.5 ounces because of the added booster charge) and used the updated M204A2 fuze.|$|E
50|$|Webster's reagent is a {{solution}} of sodium hydroxide and ethyl alcohol used to test surfaces {{for the presence of}} TNT and <b>Tetryl</b> explosive compounds.

50|$|The {{commercial}} use of explosives uses electrical detonators or the capped fuse {{which is a}} length of safety fuse to which an ordinary detonator has been crimped. Many detonators' primary explosive is a material called ASA compound. This compound is formed from lead azide, lead styphnate and aluminium and is pressed into place above the base charge, usually TNT or <b>tetryl</b> in military detonators and PETN in commercial detonators.|$|E
