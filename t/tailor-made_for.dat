According to the director, Mammootty was instrumental in casting actress Meena for the film.

He later added that no changes were made in the script when Mohanlal agreed.|$|E
5|$|The strongest bids were Memphis, Louisville, Anaheim and New Orleans. As {{the latter}} two had venues in place, they were seen as having an edge on the other two. Both Memphis and Louisville needed public funding for a new venue, and in either city, the team would have {{to play in a}} sub-optimal {{location}} for several seasons. However, {{the construction of a new}} venue was seen as an advantage by the Grizzlies, as it could be <b>tailor-made</b> <b>for</b> basketball, and the team would be able to control all revenue. The team also expected the highest local radio and television broadcasting rights in Louisville and Memphis, and that the two cities lacked other Big Four major league teams, granting the team preferred air times and increased attention from fans and media. A 2000 report from PricewaterhouseCoopers concluded that small cities often had higher attendance than larger cities because of team's professional league exclusivity. It also pointed to the strong support for college basketball in Tennessee and Kentucky.|$|E

As she continued making films, however, her relationship with her daughter B.D. began to deteriorate and her popularity with audiences was steadily declining.|$|E

25|$|During the mid-1980s, {{the market}} shifted such that {{customers}} went away from purchasing hardware and instead wanted complete systems including software, preferably <b>tailor-made</b> <b>for</b> the industry. This was a disadvantage for ND, {{as they had}} their advantage in designing hardware systems. Their lack of industry-specific software was combined with that all software development was outsourced, which meant that ND's most important sales arguments were being determined by a third party. Another development was the open standards, especially Unix, which was disliked at ND. This would remove the vendor lock-in and the well-liked Notis, which was instrumental in creating profits. Management had a high pressure from investors to create high growth rates, which again caused the company to choose short-term profit margins ahead of long-term strategic positioning.|$|E
25|$|Tattersall, a late developer, {{began his}} {{first-class}} cricket career in 1948, {{at a time}} when English bowling was weak because World War II had decimated their pre-war pace attack. He first played for Lancashire in 1948 as a medium fast bowler, taking 66 Second XI wickets. He did not establish himself until 1950 after Roberts, Price and Nutter had left the staff and he changed to bowling mainly off-breaks, something he developed in Minor County cricket. That year, {{largely as a result of}} groundsmen at Old Trafford deciding to eliminate watering of the pitch, Tattersall consistently had pitches <b>tailor-made</b> <b>for</b> him and he did not disappoint, being the leading wicket-taker in first-class cricket with 193 victims for under 14 apiece. This won him the inaugural Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketer of the Year award. Although he was not risked in the Tests against a powerful West Indian batting line-up, Tattersall was chosen as a reinforcement for the 1950–51 Ashes series that winter. He did modestly in Australia, but bowled well enough on the more helpful New Zealand pitches to establish himself in the Test team for fourteen consecutive matches.|$|E

500|$|The {{writers of}} The Simpsons {{know about the}} forum and have on several {{occasions}} read the comments made on it.

But {{the stakes}} remain frustratingly low and it's one of those {{contemporary}} middlebrow projects that asks us to root for a genial, shallow individual as he learns {{to be a little}} less the man he was." [...] Julian Sancton of Vanity Fair wrote, [...] "There are two movies in Up in the Air: one about a guy who's flying around the country firing people, and one about a commitment-phobe who's flying away from responsibility and a shot at true love, as embodied by Farmiga. There is no attempt to braid these two threads together, and that's where the movie feels unsatisfying." [...] J. Hoberman of The Village Voice wrote, [...] "Like Juno, Up in the Air conjures a troubling reality and then wishes it away. The filmmakers have peeked into the abyss and averted their eyes... warns that you can't go home again – and then, full of false cheer and false consciousness, pretends you can." ...|$|E

[...] Stern compared the song to Madonna's 1992 single [...] "Deeper and Deeper", noting that unlike the UK dance acts and the teen-pop groups paying homage to 1990s house music, Madonna had lived through that era. Calling the song a [...] "total beast of a collaborative effort", and ended his review saying [...] "Fuck singing about Tanqueray in the club: This is the Madonna we've always known and lived to love, with flares of the future and nostalgic nods to the past." [...] Times Jamieson Cox observed that [...] "Living for Love" [...] was <b>tailor-made</b> <b>for</b> radio, with the increase in popularity of house music and the crossover success of British house musicians. Giving the song a rating of three out of five stars, Hardeep Phull from New York Post complimented it for being an [...] "euphoric, gospel-tinged dance track that will rejuvenate even the most beaten-down of souls thanks to its 'love's gonna lift me up' refrain." [...] Phull expected the song to be a hit on the dance and pop charts.|$|E
