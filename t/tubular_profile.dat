40|$|Background. - Dysgenetic male {{pseudohermaphroditism}} (DMP) is {{a sexual}} differentiation disorder characterized by bilateral dysgenetic testes, persistent müllerian structures, and cryptorchidism in {{individuals with a}} 46,XY karyotype. However, the histologic criteria for the diagnosis of DMP are poorly established. Objective. - To determine gonadal histology in children with DMP. Patients and Methods. - Between 1996 and 1998, 13 patients with DMP were evaluated on our service. The clinical diagnosis of DMP {{was based on a}} 46,XY karyotype, sex ambiguity, high levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and low levels Of antimüllerian hormone, a decreased testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation without accumulation of testosterone precursors, and the presence of müllerian structures. Molecular sequencing the HMGbox region of the SRY gene did not reveal any mutations. Biopsies were performed for 22 of 26 gonads (patient age at the time of biopsy, 16 months to 10 years). Conventional microscopy was used to evaluate mean tubular diameter, tubular fertility index, and number of Sertoli cells per <b>tubular</b> <b>profile.</b> Results. - All 26 gonads were located outside of the labioscrotal folds. Their histologic features varied from only a reduction in tubular size to features of a streak gonad. Five of the 22 gonads grossly resembled a streak gonad. The mean tubular diameter was severely reduced (> 30 % reduction relative to the normal tubular diameter for the patient's age) in 4 gonads, markedly reduced (10 %- 30 %) in 11 gonads, slightly reduced (< 10 %) in one gonad, and normal in one gonad. The tubular fertililty index, expressed as the percentage of tubular profiles containing germ cells, was severely reduced (< 30 % of normal values) in 9 gonads, markedly reduced (50 %- 30 %) in 2 gonads, and normal in 6 gonads. The number of Sertoli cells per <b>tubular</b> <b>profile</b> was elevated in 16 gonads and normal in one gonad. Thin tubules surrounded by fibrous tissue were occasionally observed. Conclusion. - The histologic findings confirmed the clinical diagnosis of DMP in every patient in the present series.

The results showed a better performance on energy absorption for the circular discontinuities located in middle height. With respect to a profile without holes, a maximum increase of 7 % in energy absorption capacity was obtained experimentally. Also, the numerical simulation confirmed that the implementation of circular discontinuities can reduce the peak load (Pmax) by 10 %.

Post-operative survival periods ranged from 20 hours to 14 days. At all stages, only boutons containing clear, round vesicles (R-boutons) and those containing dense-cored vesicles (DCV-boutons) underwent degeneration. Boutons containing flattened vesicles (F-boutons) appeared to be unaffected. Changes were seen even at 20 hours after injection and these were confined to R-boutons only.

Type I, characterized by a thin inner oospore wall (IOW), large lipid globules and two nuclei, was recovered only in samples collected in October. These oospores {{were considered to be}} immature. Maturation occurred during November and involved a noticeable increase in thickness of the IOW, fusion of nuclei, formation of an ooplast and break up of large lipid globules into smaller ones (type II oospores). A few oospores (type III) showed abnormal organization with very large lipid globules and less frequently discernible nuclei. IOW solubilization, dissolution of the ooplast and lipid globules and nuclear division were the first detectable events during oospore germination. Germinating oospores produce a germ tube which was terminated by a sporangium. In its young stage, the sporangium had a thick wall and an unusual multi-layered membrane.

Whether proximal tubular volume is increased in obese subjects and whether their glomerular and tubular urinary spaces are enlarged is unknown. Objective: To determine whether proximal tubules and glomerular and tubular urinary space are enlarged in obese subjects with proteinuria and glomerular hyperfiltration. Methods: Kidney biopsies from 11 non-diabetic obese with proteinuria and 14 non-diabetic lean patients with a creatinine clearance above 50 ml/min and with mild or no interstitial fibrosis were retrospectively analyzed using morphometric methods.

40|$|Tonicity-responsive {{enhancer}} binding protein (TonEBP) is a transcriptional activator of the Rel family. In the renal medulla, TonEBP stimulates genes encoding proteins {{involved in}} cellular accumulation of organic osmolytes, the vasopressin-regulated urea transporters (UT-A), and {{heat shock protein}} 70. To understand the role of TonEBP {{in the development of}} urinary concentrating ability, TonEBP expression during rat kidney development was investigated. In embryonic kidneys, TonEBP immunoreactivity was detected 16 days postcoitus in the cytoplasm of the endothelial cells surrounding the medullary collecting ducts (MCD). By 20 days, TonEBP was detected in most <b>tubular</b> <b>profiles</b> in the medulla, including the loop of Henle and MCD, and interstitial cells. The intensity of TonEBP immunoreactivity was much higher in the vasa recta than the tubules. In addition, immunoreactivity was localized predominantly to the cytoplasm. On postnatal day 1, two major changes were observed. TonEBP immunoreactivity shifted to the nucleus, and the intensity of TonEBP immunoreactivity of the tubules increased dramatically. These changes were associated with an increase in TonEBP and sodium-myo-inositol cotransporter mRNA abundance. Thereafter, TonEBP expression in <b>tubular</b> <b>profiles</b> increased moderately. The adult pattern of TonEBP expression was established at postnatal day 21 coincident with full maturation of the renal medulla. Thus expression of TonEBP in developing kidneys occurred predominantly in the medulla and preceded expression of its target genes, including UT-A. These data suggest that TonEBP contributes to the development of urine-concentrating ability. close 293...|$|R

40|$|Proteinuria and tubulointerstitial lesions in lupus nephritis. BackgroundResponse of the renal tubules to {{proteinuria}} is {{implicated in}} progression of renal disease. Experimentally, proteinuria causes increased tubular synthesis of macrophagic and other chemokines, with increased tubular cellular proliferation and apoptosis, leading to interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. Clinically, diminution of proteinuria {{leads to the}} slowing of progression, but whether this leads to reduction in tubular lesions has not been directly demonstrated in humans. MethodsInitial (Bx 1) and systematic six-month biopsies (Bx 2) from 71 patients with lupus nephritis were studied, with a subset of 34 biopsies also stained for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the macrophage marker PGM 1, and cytokeratins (AE 1 /AE 3), and morphometric cell and <b>tubular</b> <b>profile</b> counts performed. ResultsPositive correlations were found between increasing levels of proteinuria and the following light microscopic parameters: tubular epithelial pyknosis, tubular epithelial nuclear “activation,” tubular lumenal macrophages, interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, but not with tubulointerstitial immunofluorescence. Significant positive correlations also were found with the following immunohistochemical parameters: PCNA in epithelial cells (r = 0. 74) and tubular luminal cells (r = 0. 47); tubular lumenal macrophages (r = 0. 63) and tubular epithelial cells with acquired PGM 1 staining (r = 0. 36); and pyknotic tubular epithelial cells (r = 0. 47). All showed strong correlations with serum creatinine (SCr) as well. All were reduced at Bx 2, generally in parallel to the reduction in proteinuria. Tubulointerstitial immune deposits appear to play only a minor {{role in the development}} of tubular epithelial lesions and the progression of renal disease in lupus. They show only limited correlation with SCr and no correlation with proteinuria. By multiple regression, they are not associated with tubular epithelial lesions, interstitial inflammation or interstitial fibrosis at either biopsy, whereas tubular epithelial lesions are strongly associated with interstitial inflammation at Bx 1 and with interstitial fibrosis at Bx 2. Cytokeratin correlated strongly with SCr (r = 0. 53, P = 0. 002) but not with proteinuria (r = 0. 27, NS), and was the sole immunohistochemical parameter to increase at Bx 2. It appears to be a sensitive marker for tubular atrophy. ConclusionsIn this study both proteinuria and SCr showed a hierarchy of correlations with morphologic variables: Tubular epithelial cell changes> tubular macrophages> interstitial inflammation> interstitial fibrosis, corresponding to current experimental models, but not previously demonstrated in humans...|$|E
40|$|Pultruded {{glass fibre}} {{reinforced}} polymers (GFRP) profile is a promising structural member for space latticed shell structures {{because of the}} advantageous properties such as high strength-to-weight ratio (in pultrusion direction), corrosion resistance and lower maintenance. In particular, when tubular profiles are used, a better resistance against local buckling, global buckling and lateral torsional buckling can be achieved compared with open sections. Despite the advantageous characteristics, the design and fabrication of tubular connections {{has been identified as}} a critical issue for the proposed applications due primarily to the geometric constraints of the closed shape, the distinct material properties of FRP, and the threedimensional nature of space latticed shell structures. Until recently, {{only a limited number of}} connection systems have been proposed for FRP space latticed shell structures and there is still a need to develop a simple, economic and versatile joining method. This thesis proposed a bolted sleeve joint (BSJ) for assembling GFRP tubular profiles into space latticed shell structures. In the proposed BSJ, the FRP profile and steel connector are telescoped and clamped using mechanical bolts. The end of the steel connector can be incorporated with compatible end fittings for connection to a nodal joint for space latticed shell structure. The proposed BSJ allows the flexibility in adjusting design parameters such as the bolt group configuration, memb 9 er size and type of fastener, depending on the design requirements. In addition, all connecting elements are commercially available and no advanced techniques are required for the fabrication. The joint performances were investigated at three level, namely joint level, component level and structural level. Stage one Goint level) focused on the joint design and performance under static axial loadings. Four batches of specimens were prepared and tested under static axial tension and compression. Design parameters, including the type of fastener (ordinary bolt or blind bolt), member size, and bolt group layout, were selected and examined. A simple analytical design model was proposed to estimate the joint capacity, showing good agreement with experiment. Design recommendations based on the current investigation were also made for the further improvement of joint performance. Stage two (component level) was an experimental and numerical study on the member capacity of pultruded GFRP square <b>tubular</b> <b>profile</b> with BSJ end conditions. Three batches of specimens assembled with FRP profiles in different lengths and BSJs at both ends were prepared and tested under static axial compression. A detailed 3 D FE model considering bolt geometry, contact behaviour, bolt pretension, initial geometric imperfection and FRP failure criterion, was developed and validated with experimental results, showing good agreement. The relationship between effective length factor and member slenderness was derived based on FEA, and then used in conjunction with existing pultruded GFRP box tubular column design equations to predict the member capacity of structural members with BSJ end conditions. The final stage (structural level) investigated the performance of BSJ at a structural level. An experimental investigation was first conducted to obtain the M- () behaviour of BSJ. It was followed by a structural analysis and design of an FRP domed roof with BSJ modelled by spring elements using FEA. The inputs of the joint rotational stiffness and axial stiffness for the springs were determined from the linear portions of the orresponding experimental curves. The ULS and SLS performance of the FRP domed roof were evaluated on a LRFD basis under ASCE- 07 design loads. Parametric studies were also performed to identify the effects of joint rotational stiffness, axial stiffness and the materials (steel or pultruded GFRP) used for structural members on the structural performance. Design recommendations were also developed based on the structural analysis and the parametric studies. Awards: Vice-Chancellor’s Commendation for Masters Thesis Excellence in 2015...|$|E

Ultrastructurally, blastemalike cells were undifferentiated forms resembling metanephric blastema. <b>Tubular</b> <b>profiles</b> of varying development were typified by very prominent apical junctional complexes and a basal lamina, but no organized brush-border. "Reniform" islands were groups of more maturely formed tubules associated with the production of an interstitial matrix consisting almost solely of multilamellar basement membrane. Glomeruloid bodies were invaginations of small podocytelike cells, with a profusion of thin cytoplasmic processes resembling foot processes, and internal, homogeneous areas of basement membrane continuous with that surrounding the entire structure. As such, these structures were consistent with primitive attempts at glomerular differentiation but without vascular or mesangial elements. The squamoid foci were representative of true squamous differentiation in comprising cells filled with intermediate filaments and interconnected by lateral interdigitations and multiple, well-formed desmosomes. Spindle-shaped tumor cells disposed in fascicles, {{which could have been}} interpreted as bipotential differentiation into secondary mesenchyme at the histologic level, differed from the blastemal cell type only in shape. Ultrastructurally, the fascicles, in most cases, consisted of thin, basement-membrane-invested ribbons of attenuated cells enclosing small lumens sealed by intercellular junctions, suggestive of abortive tubule formation.

40|$|Wnt {{proteins}} play {{a central}} role in development. Wnt secretion is mediated by the Wnt-binding protein Wntless (Wls), which transports Wnt from the Golgi to the cell surface for release. Wnt secretion requires recycling of Wls through a retromer-dependent endosome-to-Golgi trafficking pathway, but the mechanism remains poorly understood. Using C. elegans and Drosophila genetics, we established that Wls recycling requires an evolutionarily conserved, ‘non-classical’ retromer pathway, that functions independently of the classical retromer sorting nexins. We found sorting nexin- 3, SNX 3, has an evolutionarily conserved function in Wls recycling and Wnt secretion. SNX 3 interacts directly with the cargo-selective sub-complex of retromer.

On the basis of reformability response, the benefits of filling the tubular member with concrete are highlighted. The favorable performance that results from using a relatively, high-grade concrete infill is also highlighted. The addition of a concrete infill to the tube stiffens and strengthens the otherwise relatively flexible tube walls, enhancing overall connection behavior in terms of stiffness, strength, and ductility. The performance of connections to concrete-filled <b>tubular</b> steel <b>profiles</b> using blind bolts with headed anchors is shown to be suitable for moment-resisting construction...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} {{the role of a}} {{previously}} described tubulovesicular compartment near the cis-Golgi apparatus in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -to-Golgi protein transport by light and immunoelectron microscopy in Vero cells. The compartment is defined by a 53 -kDa transmembrane protein designated p 53. When transport of the vesicular stomatitis virus strain ts 045 G protein was arrested at 39. 5 degrees C, the G protein accumulated in the ER but had access to the p 53 compartment. At 15 degrees C, the G protein was exported from the ER into the p 53 compartment which formed a compact structure composed of vesicular and <b>tubular</b> <b>profiles</b> in close proximity to the Golgi. Upon raising the temperature to 32 degrees C, the G protein migrated through the Golgi apparatus while the p 53 compartment resumed its normal structure again. These results establish the p 53 compartment as the 15 degrees C intermediate of the ER-to-Golgi protein transport pathway...|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic {{compression}} of <b>tubular</b> <b>profiles</b> with high electrical conductivity is an innovative joining process for lightweight structures. The components are joined using pulsed magnetic fields which apply radial pressures {{of up to}} 200 MPa to tubular workpieces, causing a symmetric reduction of the diameter with typical strain rates of up to 10 ^ 4 sec^(- 1). This process avoids any surface damage of the workpiece {{because there is no}} contact between component and forming tool. The strength of electromagnetically formed joints made of aluminum tubes under cyclic loads is essential to establish electromagnetic forming in automotive structures. In the present paper, the quasi-static performance of tubular joints made by electromagnetic compression produced of different mandrel materials will be analyzed as to the influence of process parameters. Therefore, experimental investigations on aluminum tubes (AA 6060) joined on mandrels made of different aluminum, copper, and steel alloys were carried out. Furthermore, the behavior of joints with both mandrel and tube made of AA 6060 at swelling cyclic loads (R = δ_ min / δ_ max = 0) has been evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic {{compression}} of <b>tubular</b> <b>profiles</b> with high electrical conductivity is an innovative joining {{process for the}} manufacturing of lightweight structures. Taking conventional interference fits into account, the contact area s influence on the joint s quality seems to be of significance, as e. g. the contact area and the friction coefficient between the joining partners determine an allowed axial load or torsional momentum proportionally. Therefore, different contact area surfaces were prepared by shot peening and different machining operations and strategies. The mandrel s surfaces were prepared by shot peening with glass beads and Al 2 O 3 particles. Alternatively, preparation was done using simultaneous five axis milling, because potential joining partners in lightweight frame structures within the Transregional Collaborative Research Centre SFB/TR 10 would be manufactured similarly. After that, the manufactured surfaces were characterized by measuring the surface roughness and using confocal whitelight microscopy. After joining by electromagnetic compression, the influence of different mandrel s surface conditions on the joint s mechanical properties were analyzed by tensile tests. Finally, conclusions and design rules for the manufacturing of joints by electromagnetic compression are given...|$|R
40|$|The {{differentiation}} of the fibroblast was {{followed in the}} dental pulp of continuously growing incisors of the guinea pig. Based on the ultrastructure, the processes of {{differentiation of}} the fibroblasts might be conveniently broken into three stages; Stage I – period of early differentiation, Stage II – period of maturation and functioning, and Stage III – period of regression. During Stage I the cell had structural characteristics shared by other less differentiated cells. The endoplasmic reticulum was poorly developed, showing vesicular to <b>tubular</b> <b>profiles.</b> The ribosomes were abundant but were mostly distributed in free form. Mitochondria were small and had irregular interiors. Stage II was characterized by a striking development of the rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum, which appeared in various shapes and sizes. The Golgi complex was enlarged, and contained some fibriller materials in dilated portions of its membraneous elements. Other features described in the cytoplasm of fibroblasts from other sources were confirmed. Stage III was characterized by the decrease in size and number of various cytoplasmic constituents and was considered to represent cells {{in the state of}} regression...|$|R
40|$|The Golgi {{apparatus}} of {{primary and secondary}} spermatocytes is composed of several stacks of saccules, made up of 4 - 8 saccules and vesicular and <b>tubular</b> <b>profiles.</b> The Golgi apparatus exhibits an hemispherical shape lying over the nucleus. During late prophase and metaphase {{of the first and}} second maturation divisions the characteristic cap shape of the organelle is undetectable. It appears instead as a single agglomeration of lamellae, vesicles and branching tubules. During anaphase this single agglomerate breaks up into small Golgi fragments which persist in early telophase. Such a Golgi fragment is composed of 2 - 3 short saccules either single or loosely piled up and surrounded by vesicles and tubules of various kinds. By late telophase one Golgi fragment adheres to the nucleus, while the remaining ones gather around it to form the single Golgi apparatus. After each division the Golgi apparatus is re-formed and disposed in a corona-like manner caping the nucleus. Thus the Golgi apparatus undergoes marked morphological changes during meiosis but remains present throughout the two successive divisions...|$|R
40|$|Male {{infertility}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} health problems in our society and the possibility that chemicals may disrupt the endocrine system in humans and animals has received considerable attention in the scientific and public community. This investigation was therefore set up to determine the testiculotoxic effect of musk-based incense (MBI) on adult albino rats, using histology and sperm parameters. The stereological evaluation of the rat testes showed that the tubular diameter, the cross sectional area of the tubules, the number of <b>tubular</b> <b>profiles</b> per unit area and the mean numerical density of seminiferous tubules of the group B rats that were exposed to smoke from 2 g of MBI approximated those of the control animals while rats that were exposed to 3 g and 5 g of MBI shows a statistically significant (p 0. 05) in sperm motility, sperm count and sperm morphology when compared to Group A. Group C & D showed significant decrease (p < 0. 05) in sperm count, sperm motility, and an increase in abnormal sperm morphology. The histological examinations of the MBI exposed groups of rats showed a derangement of the basal semineferous epithelia, testicular atrophy, germinal aplasia and hypospermatozoa in the lumen...|$|R
40|$|Localization of phosphatases in the {{parathyroid}} {{of laying}} hens was examined by electron microscopy. Activities of both alkaline phosphatase and adenosine triphosphatase were intensive on the apposed plasma membranes between contiguous chief cells, but weak or almost lacking on those facing the interstitial connective tissue, and this finding differed from previous data in mammals. This difference {{seemed to be}} associated with the fact that in the parenchymal cells of the hens there was found a narrow, delicate filament-rich zone in the peripheral cytoplasm along the basal lamina. Activities of both thiamine pyrophosphatase and inosine diphosphatase were seen in most of the Golgi cisternae having serpentine <b>tubular</b> <b>profiles,</b> and this indicated that the latter cisterna belong to the Golgi apparatus. Acid phosphatase activities were mainly demonstrated in lysosomal dense bodies, including autophagic vacuoles, as well as in most of the lipofuscin granules, and only occasionally encountered in the Golgi apparatus, including the thick membranous cisternae, in contrast with findings in mammals. The reason for this weak activity in this organelle was discussed in relation to calcium metabolism, secretory products, and lysosomes in the laying hen...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{functional}} {{changes in}} experimental cystic disease are tubular in origin. Chronic (30 weeks) structural and functional changes were correlated in diphenylthiazole (DPT) -induced {{polycystic kidney disease}} (PKD) in rats. DPT induced {{two different types of}} progressive tubular changes: cystic transformation and hyperplastic/atrophic tubular changes. Cystic changes diffusely involved collecting tubules in the outer medulla and cortex, and they were progressive over 30 weeks. Hyperplastic/atrophic changes occurred as clusters of tubules in the cortex and involved between 25 % and 50 % of <b>tubular</b> <b>profiles</b> after 12 and 30 weeks of drug treatment. Thus, the two types of tubular change were independent of each other and represent different cellular responses to the drug. DPT treatment induced no detectable light- and electron-microscopic or histochemical alterations in glomeruli or renal blood vessels. Renal functional changes consisted of: (1) early (4 weeks) and persistent impairment of concentrating ability; (2) a progressive drop in creatinine clearance and elevation in BUN; and (3) the late onset (30 weeks) of moderate proteinuria. These findings suggest that cystic as well as hyperplastic-atrophic tubular changes contribute to the loss of tubular and renal function in DPT-induced PKD. Both types of tubular lesions may have a {{role in the development of}} impaired renal function in other forms of experimental and clinical PKD...|$|R
40|$|In hepatocytes {{of fetal}} rats, cytoplasmic organelles {{identifiable}} as microbodies appeared, although {{only a few}} of them showed nucleoids and most of them generally had an electronlucent appearance due to the low density of their matrices. Some of these microbodies, especially those lacking the nucleoid, showed a substantial connection with granular endoplasmic reticulum (ER), suggesting that microbodies might be formed from granular ER. Agranular <b>tubular</b> <b>profiles</b> projecting from the surface of microbodies were found with a high frequency in fetal and neonatal rats; however, this phenomenon may not provide crucial evidence suggestive of the derivation of microbodies from agranular ER. Growth and maturation of microbodies are considered to be brought about by an enlargement of these organelles, an increase in their matrices, an appearance and enlargement of the nucleoids, and an increase in the enzyme involved. The specific activity of urate oxidase in the isolated nucleoid fraction was significantly lower in the earlier stages of postnatal growth than later. Increases in the enzyme activity per nucleoid (maturation of the nucleoid), in the number of microbodies containing nucleoids (formation of the nucleoid), and in the size of nucleoids (growth of the nucleoid), may contribute to increases in the enzyme activity of the tissues...|$|R
