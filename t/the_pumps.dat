5|$|Commentators {{generally}} agree that, {{to precipitate}} {{such a course}} of action as abandonment of an apparently sound and seaworthy ship, with ample provisions, some extraordinary and alarming circumstance must have arisen. In his evidence to the enquiry, Deveau ventured an explanation based on the sounding rod found on the derelict's deck. He suggested that Briggs abandoned ship after a sounding that, because of a malfunction of <b>the</b> <b>pumps</b> or other mishap, had given a false impression that the vessel was taking on water rapidly. A severe waterspout strike before the abandonment could explain the amount of water in the ship, and the ragged state of her rigging and sails. The low barometric pressure generated by the spout could have driven water from the bilges up into <b>the</b> <b>pumps,</b> leading the crew to assume the ship had taken on more water than she had, and was in danger of sinking.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March 1800, Agamemnon {{was damaged}} {{when she ran}} onto the Penmarks Rocks. She came into Falmouth on 25 March 1800. On her way to port she had {{encountered}} , which assisted her and accompanied her into port. With {{the assistance of the}} crews from two sloops, the guardship , and troops from Pendennis Castle at <b>the</b> <b>pumps,</b> the crew managed to stop the water level in the hold rising any further. Agamemnon made for Plymouth for repairs. Movement caused the leak to gain on the men at <b>the</b> <b>pumps</b> once more, and when she was off Penlee Point, Agamemnon fired a gun for assistance. When she reached Plymouth she was lashed to a sheer hulk to prevent her sinking.|$|E
40|$|A pump {{arrangement}} comprises a pump (20) {{having a}} pump inlet (22) and a pump outlet (24), which {{are designed to}} pump a fluid from <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> inlet to <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> outlet, and it further comprises a safety valve (40), which is disposed between <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> outlet (24) and an outlet (48) of <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> arrangement and comprises a valve set (42) and a valve cover (44). The valve seat, <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> outlet, and <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> inlet are structured in a first surface of a first single-piece part (14) of <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> arrangement, while <b>the</b> valve cover is configured in a second single-piece part (12) of <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> arrangement. An inlet (46) of <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> arrangement and a fluid region (50) fluidically connected therewith are configured in a third part (10) of <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> arrangement. <b>The</b> second single-piece part (12) is disposed between the first single-piece part (14) and the third part (10) of <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> arrangement such that a pressure present in the fluid region closes the safety valve, wherein <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> inlet and <b>the</b> inlet of <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> arrangement are fluidically connected...|$|R
50|$|Cataracts {{were also}} used as an {{over-speed}} safety device for direct-acting water pumps. A seesaw or 'differential' lever was placed between <b>the</b> <b>pump's</b> piston rod and a cataract adjusted for <b>the</b> <b>pump's</b> normal working speed. If <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> suddenly accelerated, owing to <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> bursting or similar, the piston would overtake the cataract and {{the action of the}} differential lever would then close <b>the</b> <b>pump's</b> steam inlet valve and stop <b>the</b> <b>pump,</b> limiting possible damage.|$|R
40|$|A pump {{arrangement}} comprises a microfluidic pump (20) {{having a}} pump inlet (22) and a pump outlet (24), which is configured to pump a fluid from <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> inlet to <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> outlet, wherein <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> inlet (22) and an inlet (46) of <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> arrangement are fluidically connected. <b>The</b> <b>pump</b> arrangement further comprises a safety valve arrangement having first safety valve (40), the first safety valve (40) being arranged between <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> outlet (24) {{and an outlet}} (48) of <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> arrangement and comprising a first valve seat (42) and a first valve lid (44).

5|$|The Watten {{site was}} {{captured}} on 4 September 1944 by Canadian forces. The Germans had evacuated {{it a few}} days earlier and removed <b>the</b> <b>pumps</b> which kept the cavernous basement free from water; not long afterwards it began to flood. This made a substantial amount of the bunker inaccessible to the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Cook then {{ordered that}} the ship be {{lightened}} to help her float off the reef. Iron and stone ballast, spoiled stores and all but four of the ship's guns were thrown overboard, and the ship's drinking water pumped out. The crew attached buoys to the discarded guns {{with the intention of}} retrieving them later, but this proved impractical. Every man on board took turns on <b>the</b> <b>pumps,</b> including Cook and Banks.|$|E
5|$|The {{low-pressure}} {{oxygen and}} low-pressure fuel turbopumps were mounted 180Â° apart on the orbiter's aft fuselage thrust structure. The {{lines from the}} low-pressure turbopumps to the high-pressure turbopumps contain flexible bellows that enable the low-pressure turbopumps to remain stationary {{while the rest of}} the engine is gimbaled for thrust vector control, and also to prevent damage to <b>the</b> <b>pumps</b> when loads were applied to them. The liquid-hydrogen line from the LPFTP to the HPFTP is insulated to prevent the formation of liquid air.|$|E
50|$|In other cases, <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> user {{may prefer}} to take <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> off all together: This {{is when a}} {{combination}} of a slow-acting insulin and <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> basal rate work well together. <b>The</b> <b>pump</b> can be removed before a preplanned activity (anything from football practice to water skiing to dancing), and <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> user continues with the reduced basal insulin coming from injected Lantus or Levemir. After the activity is complete, <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> goes back on.|$|R
30|$|McKee (1990) {{rely on the}} {{correlation}} between the amount of filling of <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> and pumping cycle to control <b>the</b> <b>pumping</b> speed for preventing the well from being pumped dry or pump-off. Gibbs (1993) utilized <b>the</b> downhole <b>pump</b> card to detect <b>the</b> various <b>pump</b> problem and control <b>the</b> <b>pumping</b> units such as stop, restart, increasing or decreasing <b>the</b> <b>pumping</b> speed by a controller.|$|R
50|$|Pumps {{typically}} have an inlet where the fluid enters <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> {{and an outlet}} where the fluid comes out. The inlet location {{is said to be}} at the suction side of <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b> <b>The</b> outlet location is said to be at the discharge side of <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b> Operation of <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> creates suction (a lower pressure) at the suction side so that fluid can enter <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> through <b>the</b> inlet. <b>Pump</b> operation also causes higher pressure at the discharge side by forcing the fluid out at the outlet. There may be pressure sensing devices at <b>the</b> <b>pump's</b> suction and/or discharge sides which control the operation of <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b> For example, if the suction pressure of a centrifugal pump is too low, a device may trigger <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> to shut off to keep it from running dry; i. e. with no fluid entering.|$|R
5|$|The {{pumping station}} {{operated}} continuously, providing {{water for the}} increasing traffic on the canal. Problems {{with the size of}} the water wheel, which was supported at either end, meant that the middle of the wheel sagged, putting strain on the bearings and stays. In the 1840s the trussing was changed from stays to tension rods to strengthen and lighten the wheel, along with improvements to <b>the</b> <b>pumps.</b> The changes to the wheel were unsuccessful, and in the 1850s a central bearing was added dividing the wheel in two.|$|E
5|$|This pumping {{project was}} {{designed}} to increase the surface area of the Great Salt Lake, and thus increase the rate of water evaporation. <b>The</b> <b>pumps</b> drove some of {{the water of the}} Great Salt Lake into the 320,000-acre (1300-square kilometer) Newfoundland Evaporation Basin in the desert west of the lake. A weir in the dike {{at the southern end of}} the Newfoundland Mountains regulated the level of water in the basin, and it sometimes returned salty water from the evaporation basin into the main body of the Great Salt Lake.|$|E
5|$|Thistle {{was almost}} {{completely}} destroyed. Most wooden buildings were carried {{away in the}} floodwaters. The state installed a temporary pumping station to prevent the lake from overflowing the dam; patrol boats skimmed up the floating remains of the town to prevent the debris from blocking <b>the</b> <b>pumps.</b> Most remains were either naturally deposited or placed {{on the eastern shore}} of the lake.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pump</b> shaft is {{connected}} to the gas separator or the protector by a mechanical coupling at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b> Fluidsenter <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> through an intake screen and are lifted by <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> stages. Other parts include the radial bearings (bushings) distributed {{along the length of the}} shaft providing radial support to <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> shaft. An optional thrust bearing takes up part of the axial forces arising in <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> but most of those forces are absorbed by the protectorâs thrust bearing.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> {{bicycle tire}} <b>pump,</b> like many {{mechanical}} devices, contains several structural {{features that are}} hidden or invisible and must be inferred from the function of <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b> For <b>the</b> bicycle <b>pump</b> <b>the</b> invisible features are the inlet and outlet valves and the three phases of movement of air, entering <b>the</b> <b>pump,</b> moving through <b>the</b> <b>pump,</b> exiting <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b> Each feature received 1 point {{for a total of}} 5 possible points.|$|R
50|$|Most {{centrifugal}} pumps are not self-priming. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> casing must {{be filled with}} liquid before <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> is started, or <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> {{will not be able}} to function. If <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> casing becomes filled with vapors or gases, <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> impeller becomes gas-bound and incapable of pumping. To ensure that a centrifugal pump remains primed and does not become gas-bound, most {{centrifugal pumps}} are located below the level of the source from which <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> is to take its suction. The same effect can be gained by supplying liquid to <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> suction under pressure supplied by another <b>pump</b> placed in <b>the</b> suction line.|$|R
5|$|In early 1943, Ingersoll Rand pulled out. Keith {{approached}} the Clark Compressor Company and Worthington Pump and Machinery but they turned it down, {{saying that it}} could not be done. So Keith and Groves saw executives at Allis-Chalmers, who agreed to build a new factory to produce <b>the</b> <b>pumps,</b> even though the pump design was still uncertain. The SAM Laboratories came up with a design, and Westinghouse built some prototypes that were successfully tested. Then Judson Swearingen at the Elliott Company came up with a revolutionary and promising design that was mechanically stable with seals that would contain the gas. This design was manufactured by Allis-Chalmers.|$|E
5|$|Monitor {{likewise}} did {{not survive}} the year. She was ordered to Beaufort, North Carolina, on Christmas Day, {{to take part in}} the blockade there. While she was being towed down the coast (under command of her fourth captain, Commander John P. Bankhead), the wind increased and with it the waves; with no high sides, the Monitor took on water. Soon the water in the hold gained on <b>the</b> <b>pumps,</b> and then put out the fires in her engines. The order was given to abandon ship; most men were rescued by , but 16 went down with her when she sank in the early hours of December 31, 1862.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix is {{normally}} operated {{with a crew}} of one vessel command Fireboat officer, one engineer who operates <b>the</b> <b>pumps</b> and engines, one pilot who steers/navigates the boat, one fire Engine company officer, and three to five firefighters to handle hoses and nozzles. Firehouse 35 on Pier 22Â½ has seven men on duty at all times: four to serve Engine #35, and three dedicated to the two fireboats. All seven are able to man the fireboats in an emergency. As many as ten men can work Phoenix, but in October 1989 after Engine #35 was called to duty, only three were available: Pilot Arvid Havneras, Engineer Nate Hardy, and Lieutenant Bob Banchero. Both fireboat pilot and engineer are licensed by the US Coast Guard.|$|E
50|$|Most {{pumps are}} working in open systems. <b>The</b> <b>pump</b> draws oil from a {{reservoir}} at atmospheric pressure. It {{is very important that}} there is no cavitation at the suction side of <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b> For this reason the connection of the suction side of <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> is larger in diameter than the connection of the pressure side. In case of the use of multi-pump assemblies, the suction connection of <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> is often combined. It is preferred to have free flow to <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> (pressure at inlet of pump at least 0.8 bar). The body of <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> is often in open connection with the suction side of <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{two major}} {{variations}} on <b>the</b> <b>Pump</b> Tender are <b>the</b> <b>Pump</b> Aerial Tender and <b>the</b> <b>Pump</b> Rescue Tender. <b>The</b> <b>Pump</b> Aerial Tender has an additional aerial ladder and monitor for high-rise and aerial attacks. <b>The</b> <b>Pump</b> Rescue Tender, {{in addition to}} firefighting equipment, carries extra equipment primarily for motor vehicle accidents and vehicle extrication. Typical equipment includes hydraulic rescue tools (aka [...] "The Jaws of Life"), vehicle stabilisation equipment, and winches.|$|R
40|$|Plans are {{currently}} being made {{for the removal of}} <b>the</b> mixer <b>pump</b> in tank 101 SY. Because <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> is contaminated with radioactive waste, it is essential that those involved in <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> removal operation have an indication of the expected dose rates when <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> is removed. Calculations were made to determine the dose rates for removing <b>the</b> <b>pump,</b> inserting <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> into a shipping container and filling the shipping container with either steel or lead shot for shielding...|$|R
5|$|Pumping {{stations}} {{maintain the}} momentum of the oil as it goes through the pipeline. Pump Station 1 is the northernmost of 11 pump stations spread across the length of the pipeline. The original design called for 12 pump stations with 4 pumps each, but Pump Station 11 was never built. Nevertheless, the pump stations retained their intended naming system. Eight stations were operating at startup, and this number increased to 11 by 1980 as throughput rose. As of December 2006, only five stations were operating, with Pump Station 5 held in reserve. Pump Stations 2 and 7 have a capacity of moving 60,000 gallons/minute (227,125 l/min), while all other stations have a capacity of 20,000 gal/min (75,708 l/min). <b>The</b> <b>pumps</b> are natural-gas or liquid-fueled turbines.|$|E
5|$|Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns) and her {{paraplegic}} brother, Franklin (Paul A. Partain), {{travel with}} three friends, Jerry (Allen Danziger), Kirk (William Vail), and Pam (Teri McMinn), {{to visit the}} grave of the Hardestys' grandfather to investigate reports of vandalism and grave robbing. Afterwards, they decide to visit the old Hardesty family homestead. Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) who talks about his family {{who worked at the}} old slaughterhouse. He borrows Franklin's pocket-knife and cuts himself, then takes a Polaroid picture of the others and demands money for it. When they refuse to pay, he burns the photo and slashes Franklin's arm with a straight razor. The group forces him out of the van and drive on. They stop at a gas station to refuel, but the proprietor (Jim Siedow) tells them <b>the</b> <b>pumps</b> are empty.|$|E
5|$|Silver Reef's {{residents}} {{rebuilt the}} businesses {{that had been}} destroyed, but the town soon began to decline. In 1881, the Stormont Mining Company and the Barbee & Walker Mining Company had to decrease wages from $4 per day to $3.50 per day in all of their mines except the Savage mine (a Stormont property). In response to the decrease in wages, the Silver Reef Miners Union was formed. In February 1881, union members began talking about striking the mines, and as word of this potential strike spread, the Stormont Mining Company discharged those of its miners {{who were part of}} the Miners Union. In response, the discharged union members escorted the company's superintendent, Washington Allen, out of Silver Reef. Allen immediately went to the Second District Court in Beaver and filed a lawsuit against the union members. Before they went to court, the union members held a meeting and decided to shut down the Savage mine. Led by Matthew O'Loughlin, the president of the Silver Reef Miners Union, they walked through Silver Reef in rows of two, and, upon arriving at the Savage mine, O'Loughlin and nine other men went into the hoisting works and ordered the engineer on duty to shut down <b>the</b> <b>pumps</b> that kept water from the water table out of the mine. After <b>the</b> <b>pumps</b> were shut down, the group of ten went into the Savage mine and ordered everyone out.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pump</b> {{contains}} a chamber {{which has a}} valved inlet from the fluid to be pumped, a valved outlet - both of these {{at the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>pump,</b> and a pressurant inlet at the top of <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b> A pressurant is used, such as steam or pressurized helium, to drive the fluid through <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R
50|$|Magnetically coupled pumps, or {{magnetic}} drive <b>pumps,</b> vary from <b>the</b> traditional <b>pumping</b> style, as <b>the</b> motor is coupled to <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> by magnetic means {{rather than by}} a direct mechanical shaft. <b>The</b> <b>pump</b> works via a drive magnet, 'driving' <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> rotor, which is magnetically coupled to the primary shaft driven by the motor.7 They are often used where leakage of <b>the</b> fluid <b>pumped</b> poses a great risk (e.g., aggressive fluid in the chemical or nuclear industry, or electric shock - garden fountains). They have no direct connection between the motor shaft and the impeller, so no gland is needed. There is no risk of leakage, unless the casing is broken. Since <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> shaft is not supported by bearings outside <b>the</b> <b>pump's</b> housing, support inside <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> is provided by bushings. <b>The</b> <b>pump</b> size of a {{magnetic drive}} pumps can go from few Watts power to a giant 1MW.|$|R
40|$|Coil pump is {{considered}} one of non-conventional water pumping devices which use non-conventional energy sources. It is a self supporting system for <b>pumping</b> water. <b>The</b> performance of coil pump under different operating parameters is the main objective concerned of present study. The parameters considered in the present study are submerged ratios, rotational speed and number of coils of the wrapped hose. The experimental results showed significant effects on <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> performance due to the variation in submerged ratio Sr and <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> rotational speed as well. The presence of air with water for submerged ratios 0 Sr 100 % gives <b>the</b> coil <b>pump</b> its <b>pumping</b> action. Increasing <b>the</b> submerged ratio increases <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> flow rate until it reaches its maximum depending on <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> rotational speed, then decreases to zero when <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> is fully immersed. Submerged ratio has a minor effect on <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> maximum static head, it is nearly constant but decreases drastically to zero when <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> submerged ratio reaches 100 %. Increasing <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> rotational speed increases water flow rate until it reaches its maximum depending on the working submerged ratio, then the discharge decreases by increasing the rotational speed. Meanwhile slight changes are obtained for <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> static head when <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> rotational speed changes. <b>The</b> number of <b>pump</b> coils is also one of most effective parameters on <b>the</b> coil <b>pump</b> performance. Increasing number of coils increases <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> head while pump discharge is nearly constant. Good agreement is obtained between the present experimental results and theoretical results developed by other investigators...|$|R
5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process remained more encouraging, although it too had technical obstacles to overcome. By the end of 1943, Urey had over 700 people working for him on {{gaseous diffusion}}. The process involved hundreds of cascades, in which corrosive uranium hexafluoride diffused through gaseous barriers, becoming progressively more enriched at every stage. A major problem was finding proper seals for <b>the</b> <b>pumps,</b> but by far the greatest difficulty lay in constructing an appropriate diffusion barrier. Construction of the huge K-25 gaseous diffusion plant was well under way before a suitable barrier became available in quantity in 1944. As a backup, Urey championed thermal diffusion.|$|E
5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process required suitable pumps that had to meet stringent requirements. Like the diffusers, they had to resist corrosion from the uranium hexafluoride feed. Corrosion would not only damage <b>the</b> <b>pumps,</b> but would contaminate the feed. They could not afford any leakage of uranium hexafluoride, especially if it was already enriched, or leak oil, which would react with the uranium hexafluoride. They had to pump at high rates, and handle a gas twelve times as dense as air. To meet these requirements, the SAM Laboratories chose to use centrifugal pumps. They were aware that the desired compression ratio of 2.3:1 to 3.2:1 was unusually high {{for this type of}} pump. For some purposes, a reciprocating pump would suffice, and these were designed by Henry A. Boorse at the SAM Laboratories, while Ingersoll Rand tackled the centrifugal pumps.|$|E
5|$|The thermal {{efficiency}} of geothermal electric plants is low, around 10â23%, because geothermal fluids do {{not reach the}} high temperatures of steam from boilers. The laws of thermodynamics limits the efficiency of heat engines in extracting useful energy. Exhaust heat is wasted, unless {{it can be used}} directly and locally, for example in greenhouses, timber mills, and district heating. System efficiency does not materially affect operational costs as it would for plants that use fuel, but it does affect return on the capital used to build the plant. In order to produce more energy than <b>the</b> <b>pumps</b> consume, electricity generation requires relatively hot fields and specialized heat cycles. Because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy, unlike, for example, wind or solar, its capacity factor can be quite large â up to 96% has been demonstrated. The global average was 73% in 2005.|$|E
50|$|The {{impeller}} in a DGF pump {{is designed}} with dual sides. One side {{is designed to}} drive the liquid like a normal centrifugal <b>pump</b> and <b>the</b> other side is designed to draw vapor into <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> and mix it with the liquid. In addition to the new impeller, a special seal was invented to {{extend the life of}} <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b> With these innovations <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> creates a sub-atmospheric pressure region within <b>the</b> <b>pump's</b> seal chamber. As the impeller draws in the vapor it is mixed with <b>the</b> liquid being <b>pumped</b> and compressed into micro-fine bubbles. Because of the close tolerance between the backvanes of the impeller and the backplate of <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> <b>the</b> vapor is sheared into fine bubbles and then they are compressed in the sub-atmospheric pressure region of <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b> These fine bubbles become dissolved into the liquid within the volute of <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R
40|$|A novel high-birefringence {{photonic}} crystal fiber (HB-PCF) with two zero-dispersion wavelengths (ZDWs) is designed, and an extraordinarily high modal birefringence of 1. 56 x 10 (- 2) is obtained at pump wavelength lambda(p) = 1850 nm. With the designed HB-PCF, {{the effect of}} <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> parameters on <b>the</b> modulation instability (MI) in the anomalous dispersion region close to the second ZDWs of the HB-PCF is comprehensively studied in this work. A broadband and tunable optical amplification is achieved by controlling <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> power and <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> wavelength based on the combined operation of Raman effect and cross phase modulation. By optimizing <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> parameters, <b>the</b> amplification bandwidth along the fiber slow axis reaches 152 nm for <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> power P-p = 280 W and <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> wavelength lambda(p) = 1675 nm, while the gain bandwidth along the fiber fast axis is 165 nm for <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> power P-p = 600 W and <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> wavelength lambda(p) = 1818 nm...|$|R
