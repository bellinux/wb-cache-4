5|$|Also {{during this}} time fraternities began to {{purchase}} and construct houses. During the late 1800s fraternities did not have dedicated houses; instead, they inhabited residential areas scattered around grounds, such as Dawson's Row near <b>the</b> <b>Lawn</b> <b>and</b> boarding houses north of the university. In 1908, the university's Board of Visitors first offered a land lease and a $12,000 loan to Kappa Sigma to construct a fraternity house, and many other fraternities followed. Most of these were located {{just north of the}} Rotunda, on Rugby Road, Madison Lane, University Place, and the surrounding streets. Some of these houses cost up to $20,000 to build, and many drew inspiration from historic UVA buildings or residences of the Old South, using elements of Jeffersonian architecture. Two houses were even styled to closely resemble famous buildings in the area, with Zeta Psi's house modeled after Monticello and Farmington, and Phi Kappa Psi's house modeled after Carr's Hill. By 1916 most fraternities had built, purchased, or rented a house for their members.|$|E
5|$|Roughly 30% of {{the student}} body belongs to a social {{fraternity}} or sorority, with additional students involved in professional, service, and honor fraternities. Many of the university's fraternities and sororities are residential, meaning they own or rent a house for their members to use; many of these houses are located on Rugby Road and the surrounding streets, just north of the university. Additionally, three social fraternities hold reserved rooms on <b>the</b> <b>Lawn</b> <b>and</b> the Range: Kappa Sigma in Room 46 East Lawn, Trigon Engineering Society in Room 17 West Lawn, and Pi Kappa Alpha in Room 47 West Range. Reflecting UVA's tradition of student self-governance, the system is currently governed by four Greek Councils consisting of student leaders; however, it is also overseen by the Department of Fraternity and Sorority Life in the university's Office of the Dean of Students.|$|E
5|$|The First Test at Brisbane was {{dominated}} by Australia, a pattern {{that was to be}} a feature of the series, although Barnes contributed only 31 to the total of 645 which brought an innings victory. Barnes displayed his liking for slightly aggressive practical jokes in this match: during a break for a particularly ferocious thunderstorm, he got a huge block of ice out of the tub in which our drinks were kept, staggered {{to the side of the}} dressing-room and tossed it on to the roof over the English dressing-room. It caused a noise for a start that brought all the Englishmen running and then it came over the side of the gutter, crashed on to <b>the</b> <b>lawn</b> <b>and</b> slithered down the grass. Those English eyes certainly did stand out.|$|E

5|$|The {{temple and}} villa {{remained}} {{in the hands of}} Garrick's wife until her death in 1822 at the age of 98. It was subsequently bought by her solicitor, Thomas Carr, who preserved it as a monument to Garrick and even erected a statue of him in the temple to replace the Roubiliac Shakespeare. It changed hands several more times until, in 1923, the villa was converted into apartments. The riverside lawn was sold separately along with the temple and was bought by a Paul Glaize, who built a three-storey house alongside the temple. This caused such controversy and public outcry that in 1932 the site was bought by Hampton Urban District Council so that Glaize's Temple House could be demolished. <b>The</b> <b>lawn</b> <b>and</b> temple were subsequently opened to the public. They have remained in public ownership ever since.|$|E

50|$|The estate {{included}} the area {{known today as}} <b>the</b> <b>Lawns,</b> <b>and</b> was bounded by the High Street and the site of Christchurch.

25|$|More towers {{were added}} over the ensuing decades, outside the {{periphery}} of the original site—as they were not part of Mies's master plan for the TD Centre—but still positioned close enough, and in such locations, as to visually impact the sense of space within areas of the centre, forming Miesian western and southern walls to <b>the</b> <b>lawn</b> <b>and</b> a tall eastern flank to the plaza.|$|E

As well as using it as a quiet place to learn his lines and write letters, the actor used it to entertain his wife and guests for afternoon tea and dinner.

Singh remembers that he suddenly jumped in <b>the</b> <b>lawn</b> <b>and</b> started dancing to the song [...] "Chumma Chumma" [...] from the 1991 action film, Hum. He felt the thrill of performing and was interested in acting and dancing. However, after he joined H.R. College of Commerce and Economics in Mumbai, Singh realised that getting {{a break in the}} film industry was not at all easy, as it was mostly people with a film background who got these opportunities. Feeling that the idea of acting was [...] "too far-fetched", Singh focused on creative writing. He went to the United States where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Indiana University.|$|E
500|$|Once the {{pavilion}} was built, the initial plan {{was that the}} lawn seating would be free for all events. An early brochure for the Grant Park Music Festival said [...] "You never need a ticket to attend a concert! <b>The</b> <b>lawn</b> <b>and</b> the general seating section are always admission free." [...] However, when parking revenue fell short of estimates during the first year, the city charged $10 for lawn seating at the August 31, 2005, concert by Tori Amos. Amos, a classically trained musician who chose only piano and organ accompaniment for her concert, earned positive reviews as the inaugural rock and roll performer in a venue that regularly hosts classical music. The city justified the charge by contending that since the Pavilion is an open-air venue, there were many places in Millennium Park, such as the Cloud Gate, Crown Fountain and Lurie Gardens, where one could have enjoyed the sounds or {{the atmosphere of the}} park without having to pay.|$|E

500|$|Ticket {{prices for}} both the Harris Theater and the Pritzker Pavilion have been controversial. John von Rhein, {{classical}} music critic for the Chicago Tribune, notes that the theater's size poses a challenge to performers attempting to fill its seats, and feels that it overemphasizes high-priced events. [...] In 2009–2010, the theater introduced two discounted ticket programs: a $5 lunchtime series of 45-minute dance performances, and a $10 ticket program for in-person, cash-only purchases in the last 90minutes before performances.

2500|$|The Parks Department {{denied a}} permit for an anti-war march {{organized}} by United for Peace and Justice to terminate at Central Park's Great Lawn, and also denied a permit for the group's rally there. [...] Critics cited this as abridging First Amendment rights.

2500|$|Jefferson's {{original}} {{architectural design}} {{revolves around the}} Academical Village, and that name remains in use today to describe both the specific area of the Lawn, a grand, terraced green space surrounded by residential and academic buildings, the gardens, the Range, and the larger university surrounding it. The principal building of the design, the Rotunda, stands {{at the north end}} of <b>the</b> <b>Lawn,</b> <b>and</b> is the most recognizable symbol of the university. It is half the height and width of the Pantheon in Rome, which was the primary inspiration for the building. <b>The</b> <b>Lawn</b> <b>and</b> the Rotunda were the model for many similar designs of [...] "centralized green areas" [...] at universities across the country. The space was designed for students and professors to live in the same area. The Rotunda, which symbolized knowledge, showed hierarchy. The south end of the lawn was left open to symbolize the view of cultivated fields to the south, as reflective of Jefferson's ideal for an agrarian-focused nation.|$|E
