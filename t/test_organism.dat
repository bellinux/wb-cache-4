The methods employed for assessing the efficacy of disinfectants in this study are Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Test and Capacity Use Dilution Test. The clinical organisms used for the tests are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Proteus mirabilis while the commercial disinfectants used are Dettol (Chloroxylenol), Savlon (Cetrimide/chlorhexidine mixture) and TCP (Trichlorophenol) and the Naphtholics are alpha naphthol and 2 -amino- 1, 4 -naphthoquinonimine hydrochloride. Dettol showed highest antibacterial activity against all the <b>test</b> <b>organisms.</b> Savlon's antibacterial activity was high against the <b>test</b> <b>organisms</b> except Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

40|$|Purpose: The rapid {{emergence}} of drug resistance among pathogenic bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant bacteria, underlines {{the need to}} look for new antibiotics.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{find the}} {{effectiveness}} of essential oil of lemongrass {{for the treatment of}} pathogenic organisms. MethodsLemongrass oil was investigated for activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Bacillus cereus (B. cereus), Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), using Agar Diffusion Method and Broth Dilution Method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined by the Broth Dilution Method. The antibiotic susceptibility test against the <b>test</b> <b>organisms</b> was performed by Disc Diffusion Method. ResultsLemongrass was found effective against all the <b>test</b> <b>organisms</b> except P. aeruginosa. Gram positive organisms were found more sensitive to lemon grass oil as compared to gram negative <b>organisms.</b> The <b>test</b> <b>organisms</b> were found inhibited by Lemon grass oil at lower concentrations in Broth Dilution Method as compared to Agar Diffusion Method. ConclusionsThe <b>tested</b> <b>organisms,</b> particularly gram-negative organisms had shown high resistance towards different antibiotics whereas they were found to be inhibited by lemongrass oil even at lower concentration. Thus lemongrass oil is effective against drug resistant organisms. It can be suggested that use of lemongrass oil would be helpful in the treatment of infections caused by multidrug resistant organisms...|$|R

50|$|Bioaccumulation {{tests are}} {{toxicity}} tests {{that can be}} used for hydrophobic chemicals that may accumulated in the fatty tissue of aquatic organisms. Toxicants with low solubilities in water generally can be stored in the fatty tissue due to the high lipid content in this tissue.

50|$|Unlike the hookworms Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale, A. ceylanicum can competently infect {{and thrive}} within not only human hosts but other {{mammalian}} hosts as well (such as dogs, cats, or golden hamsters).
