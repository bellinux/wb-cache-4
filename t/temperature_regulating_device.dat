40|$|Nowadays, {{integration}} of small-scale electricity generators, known as Distributed Generation (DG), into distribution networks {{has become increasingly}} popular. This tendency together with the falling price of DG units has a great potential in giving the DG {{a better chance to}} participate in voltage regulation process, in parallel with other <b>regulating</b> <b>devices</b> already available in the distribution systems. The voltage control issue {{turns out to be a}} very challenging problem for distribution engineers, since existing control coordination schemes need to be reconsidered to take into account the DG operation. In this paper, a control coordination approach is proposed, which is able to utilize the ability of the DG as a voltage regulator, and at the same time minimize the interaction of DG with another DG or other active devices, such as On-load Tap Changing Transformer (OLTC).

40|$|Computer {{hydraulic}} solvers such as EPANET allow complex {{water distribution}} system networks to be simulated by design engineers. Modeling of systems containing combinations of pressure reducing valves (PRVs), pressure sustaining valves (PSVs) and flow control valves (FCVs) {{can sometimes be}} problematical. The status of PRVs, PSVs and FCVs is usually solved for based on a heuristic approach. Starting from an assumed state of the control device, a check is performed during the next step of the iteration procedure, {{as to whether the}} original assumption of each particular assumed valve status still holds. If the assumption proves to be no longer true, a correction {{of the state of the}} control device is made. It has been observed in the past that this approach may sometimes fail to converge at all, or even worse may converge to incorrect solutions when simulating networks that include pressure <b>regulating</b> <b>devices.</b> In the majority of cases for which no correct solution was obtained, the solver converged quickly to an incorrect solution. Hence, no warning message was generated to indicate there was a problem with the solution. Some simple networks incorporating PRVs and FCVs have been considered in this research. The networks have multiple pressure regulating and flow <b>regulating</b> <b>devices</b> that are placed in series and separated by substantial lengths of pipe. Even for simple networks comprising two pressure <b>regulating</b> <b>devices</b> (one pressure <b>regulating</b> <b>device</b> and one flow <b>regulating</b> <b>device)</b> in series, current hydraulic modeling software fails to converge to the correct solution for particular configurations and settings. This paper aims to consider the circumstances in which such difficulties occur and the reasons for the failure to solve. In 2002, Deuerlein in his PhD thesis proposed a new method to ensure that the correct solution for water distribution systems containing multiple pressure and flow regulating valves is obtained. He used Nash equilibrium. The application of this approach enables all simple networks (as described above) to be correctly solved that previously could not be solved or those that converged to the wrong solution in EPANET. Details of the Nash equilibrium algorithm and the specific application to some example networks that converged to the wrong solution in EPANET are presented in this paper. Arbitrary pressure and flow controlling devices in water distribution systems can now be simulated with confidence. Convergence is assured if the system's physics are feasible.
