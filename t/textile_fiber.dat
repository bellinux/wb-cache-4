5|$|The {{apartment}} in which Rona {{and her mother}} were living was seized when the communists invaded Hungary in 1919. Owing to political instability and the persecution of those with communist sympathies during the countering White Terror, an increasing amount of work at the Institute fell to Rona. When offered a position in 1921 to return to Dahlem and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, by Otto Hahn, Rona resigned. She joined Hahn's staff in Berlin to separate ionium (now known as Th-230) from uranium. Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic forced her transfer to the <b>Textile</b> <b>Fiber</b> Institute of Kaiser Wilhelm, as practical research was the only work permitted at the time. Theoretical research with no essential application was not a priority. Her training allowed her {{to return to a}} more stable Hungary and accept a position in a textile factory there in 1923. She did not care for the work and soon left, joining the staff of the Institute for Radium Research of Vienna in 1924 at the request of Stefan Meyer. Her research there focused on measuring the absorption and range of hydrogen rays, as well as on developing polonium as an alternative radioactive material to radium.|$|E

The increase in <b>textile</b> <b>fiber</b> crops such as abacá, oil products derived from the coconut, indigo, that was growing in demand, etc., generated an increase in money supply that led to the creation of the bank. Banco Español-Filipino was also granted the power to print a Philippine-specific currency (the Philippine peso) for the first time (before 1851, many currencies were used, mostly the pieces of eight).|$|E

25|$|In 1931, Ford hired chemists Robert Boyer and Frank Calvert {{to produce}} {{artificial}} silk. They {{succeeded in making}} a <b>textile</b> <b>fiber</b> of spun soy protein fibers, hardened or tanned in a formaldehyde bath, which was given the name Azlon. It was usable {{in the making of}} suits, felt hats, and overcoats. Though pilot production of Azlon reached 5000pounds per day in 1940, it never reached the commercial market; Dupont's nylon was the winner in the quest to produce artificial silk. In 1932–33, the Ford Motor Company spent approximately $1,250,000 on soybean research. By 1935, every Ford car had soy involved in its manufacture. For example, soybean oil was used to paint the automobiles, as well as fluid for shock absorbers. Ford's involvement with the soybean opened many doors for agriculture and industry to be linked more strongly than ever before.|$|E
2500|$|Cotton linters are fine, silky fibers which {{adhere to}} {{the seeds of the}} cotton plant after ginning. These curly fibers {{typically}} are less than [...] long. The term also may apply to the longer <b>textile</b> <b>fiber</b> staple lint as well as the shorter fuzzy fibers from some upland species. Linters are traditionally used in the manufacture of paper and as a raw material in the manufacture of cellulose. In the UK, linters are referred to as [...] "cotton wool". This can also be a refined product (absorbent cotton in U.S. usage) which has medical, cosmetic and many other practical uses. The first medical use of cotton wool was by Sampson Gamgee at the Queen's Hospital (later the General Hospital) in Birmingham, England.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, the {{labeling}} of garments came into law under the <b>Textile</b> <b>Fiber</b> Products Identification Act (TFPIA). The act itself imposes regulations on the advertising and {{labeling of}} <b>textile</b> <b>fiber</b> {{products that are}} being imported and exported out of the United States. These products are defined in the act as, “any fiber, yarn, or fabric used or intended for use in household textile articles”. [...] Household textile articles include “wearing apparel, costumes, draperies, floor coverings, furnishings, and bedding”. [...] The goal of the <b>Textile</b> <b>Fiber</b> Product Identification Act is to protect producers and consumers against mislabeling or false advertising about the fiber content of <b>textile</b> <b>fiber</b> products. It wasn’t until 1984 that the TFPIA was amended to include items made in The United States stating that they were “Made in U.S.A”.|$|E

Two series of polymer concrete formulations were studied, with different resin/sand (i. e. binder/fine aggregate) weight ratios. In each series, recycled <b>textile</b> chopped <b>fibers</b> at 1 and 2 % {{of the total}} weight was used. Flexural and compressive tests were performed at room temperature and load vs. displacement curves were plotted up to failure. In the study, both the influence of fiber content and resin/sand weight ratio were considered relative to the behavior of polymer concrete reinforced with <b>textile</b> <b>fibers.</b> A decrease in properties was observed as function of <b>textile</b> <b>fibers</b> content. When specific properties were considered, this tendency was kept. However, higher <b>textile</b> <b>fibers</b> content lead to a smoother failure, unlike brittleness failure behavior of unreinforced polymer concrete...|$|R

50|$|Jute {{was used}} in {{traditional}} textile machinery as fibers having cellulose (vegetable fiber content) and lignin (wood fiber content).

Therefore, jute has changed its <b>textile</b> <b>fiber</b> outlook and steadily heading towards its newer identity, i.e., wood fiber.

In this work the mechanical properties of high density polyethylene/ <b>textile</b> <b>fibers</b> residues composites were studied. Effect of pretreatment with sulfuric acid on <b>textile</b> <b>fibers</b> to prepare composites was made to provide an improvement in mechanical properties of these materials. This treatment on fibers was evaluated by X-ray diffraction technique. Composites were produced in a thermokinetic mixer in the following composition: 5 and 10 wt% fibers. After mixing the samples were injection molding according to ASTM D- 638 specification. Specimens were tested in tensile mode and composite fractures surface were analyzed in a scanning electron microscopy. Also was studied moisture absorption. Results showed that HDPE/ <b>textile</b> <b>fibers</b> residue presents good mechanical performance compared with high-density polyethylene...|$|R

40|$|<b>Textile</b> <b>fibers</b> are {{ubiquitous}} {{in the sense}} that they are present in the fabric of clothing, furniture, floor and wall covering. A remarkable variety of <b>textile</b> <b>fibers</b> with different chemical compositions are produced for many different commercial applications.
