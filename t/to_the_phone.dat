5|$|On September 19, 2012, iOS 6 was {{released}} to the iPhone 4S among other compatible iOS device as an over the air (OTA) upgrade package. According to Apple the update contains 200 new features and tweaks, which includes a new maps app, dubbed Apple Maps, Facebook integration and Passbook, an application that allows users to store their coupons, boarding passes and tickets digitally. On September 18, 2013, Apple released iOS 7 and the iPhone 4S is among other compatible iOS devices that also receive the update without any lagging issues compared to the iPhone 4. Although the device has improved performance over iOS 7, some newer features that were released to newer models such as AirDrop and CarPlay were not supported. The iPhone 4S can also run iOS 8, which {{was released}} on September 17, 2014. Given that the device was supported for more than 3 years, some newer features of the software such as Apple Pay were not supported. It is also unable to work with Apple Watch due to the relatively aged hardware. In fact, some users often reported that performance on the 4S is very slow, similar to how iOS 7 ran on the iPhone 4, and suggesting {{that they should not}} upgrade due to battery draining issues and hanging up on calls. Meanwhile, Apple released iOS 8.1.1, which brought slight improvements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and the iPad 2, but it still did not run as fast as newer models.|$|E

25|$|Hayes was a {{computer}} hobbyist, {{and felt that}} modems would be highly compelling to users of the new 8-bit computers that would soon be known as home computers.

25|$|Early modems were {{generally}} very simple devices using acoustic couplers to handle telephone operation. The user would first {{pick up the}} phone, dial a number, then press the handset into rubber cups {{on the top of}} the modem. Disconnecting at the end of a call required the user to pick up the handset and return it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> Examples of direct-connecting modems did exist, and these often allowed the host computer to send it commands to answer or hang up calls, but these were very expensive devices used by large banks and similar companies.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of this {{vertical}} monopoly, by 1940 the Bell System effectively owned most telephone service in the United States, from local and long-distance service to the telephones themselves. This allowed Bell to prohibit its customers from connecting phones not made or sold by Bell to the system without paying fees. For example, if a customer desired a type of phone not leased by the local Bell monopoly, he or she had to purchase the phone at cost, give it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> company, then pay a 're-wiring' charge and a monthly lease fee in order to use it.|$|E
