The stress–deformation response of the Manduca muscle is shown to be nonlinear pseudo-elastic, capable of large deformations and subject to stress softening during initial loading cycles. The muscle passive mechanical properties also depend on multiple time-dependent processes.

The insects grow {{at the same}} rate on both foods. There is no daily rhythm of feeding behaviour. For most insects, feeding on either food occurs in bouts with the lengths of interfeed gaps and of feeding bouts appearing to be distributed randomly. However, in many insects there is a strong correlation between the length of a feeding period and that of the preceding non-feeding period. The proportion of time spent feeding on tobacco is much greater than on artificial diet. On tobacco, feeding periods are separated by shorter interfeed gaps than on the artificial diet, while the rate of bout initiation is similar on either food. On both tobacco and artificial diet, the proportion of time spent feeding increases as the fifth stadium proceeds. This is due to both longer feeding bouts and shorter gaps. The rate of food acquisition within bouts does not change during the stadium. S. E. Reynolds, M. R. Yeomans and W. A. Timmin...|$|R

The model developed here includes the notion of multiple stress–strain cycles with increasing values of the maximum strain. The model draws upon the similarities between the cyclic softening associated with carbon-filled rubber vulcanizates and soft biological tissue. We give non-linear transversely isotropic models for the elastic response, stress relaxation, residual strain and creep of residual strain. These ideas are then combined with a transversely isotropic version of the Arruda–Boyce eight-chain model to develop a constitutive relation that is capable of accurately representing the multicyclic softening of soft biological tissue. To establish the validity of the model, we have compared it with experimental data from three cyclic uniaxial test samples, one taken from the Manduca sexta (<b>tobacco</b> hornworm) <b>caterpillar</b> and the other two samples taken from the human aorta, one in the longitudinal and the other in the circumferential direction.

Clear negative-mode MALDI-TOF/MS spectra of all analytes using DMAN as the matrix show only deprotonated analyte signals at a low picomole/femtomole limit-of-detection.

5000|$|In 2001, Walters {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{a report that}} described the escape responses of the <b>tobacco</b> hornworm <b>caterpillar</b> (Manduca sexta) to mechanical stimulation. These responses, particularly their plasticity, were remarkably similar to vertebrate escape responses. A set of defensive behavior patterns in larval Manduca sexta is described and shown to undergo sensitization following noxious mechanical stimulation. The striking response is a rapid bending that accurately propels the head towards sharply poking or pinching stimuli applied to most abdominal segments. The strike is accompanied by opening of the mandibles and, sometimes, regurgitation. The strike may function to dislodge small attackers and startle larger predators. When the same stimuli are applied to anterior segments, the head is pulled away in a withdrawal response. Noxious stimuli to anterior or posterior segments can evoke a transient withdrawal (cocking) that precedes a strike towards the source of stimulation and may function to maximize the velocity of the strike. More intense noxious stimuli evoke faster, larger strikes and may also elicit thrashing, which consists of large, cyclic, side-to-side movements that are not directed at any target. These are sometimes also associated with low-amplitude quivering cycles. Striking and thrashing sequences elicited by obvious wounding are sometimes followed by grooming-like behavior.|$|R

40|$|Fifth stadium <b>tobacco</b> hornworm <b>caterpillars,</b> Manduca sexta (L.), given {{artificial}} diet diluted {{to varying}} extents with either cellulose or water {{compensated for the}} food's reduced nutrient content by eating more of it. This compensation was, however, in most cases not sufficient to maintain normal growth rates. When the water content of the diet was reduced, the insects ate less than the usual fresh weight of food but maintained their intake of nutrients. Nevertheless, growth rate was impaired. The insects were better able to compensate for dilution of their food with water than with cellulose. The efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) was decreased when the diet was adulterated with cellulose. At moderate dilution (50 % nutrient) this was due mostly to decreased approximate digestibility (AD), but at greater dilution (25 % and 10 % nutrient content) the efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD) was decreased. ECI was maintained when the water content of the diet was increased to give 50 % nutrient concentration, but was decreased when water content was changed more radically (200 %, 25 % and 10 % nutrient diets). This was due mostly to increased metabolic costs (decreased ECD) in all cases. The retention time of food in the gut was progressively decreased (i. e. speed of passage was increased) as nutrients were replaced by cellulose. By contrast, dilution of the diet with water resulted in only slight changes in retention time, except at extreme dilution (10 % nutrient content) when retention time was reduced. Compensation of food intake was achieved by spending more (or less) time eating. Video analysis of feeding behaviour showed that there were {{significant changes in the}} length of feeding bouts and of interfeed gaps when caterpillars fed on diets of altered composition. For diets diluted with cellulose, changes in bout length and bout frequency contributed substantially to the increased time spent feeding on the adulterated food. For diets diluted with water, however, almost all of the compensatory change in behaviour was due to increased bout length, with bout frequency affected only slightly. This suggests that volumetric feedback contributes principally to the termination of feeding bouts in caterpillars, while nutrient flow may affect both the initiation and termination of feeding. W.

In case of S. litura, rutin alone had a significant effect on arrested larval development, pupal mortality and malformed adults compared to artificial diets with quercetin and chlorogenic acid. The increase in concentrations of rutin did not show proportionate increase in mortality of the larvae.

It is predicted that more generations would occur during the three future climate periods with significant variation among scenarios and models. Among the seven models, 1 - 2 additional generations were predicted during DF and VDF due to higher future temperatures in CNRM-CM 3, ECHams 5 & CSIRO-Mk 3. 5 models.
