5|$|At the Opéra-Comique, {{after its}} 1883 revival, Carmen was always {{presented}} in <b>the</b> <b>dialogue</b> version with minimal musical embellishments. By 1888, {{the year of}} the 50th anniversary of Bizet's birth, the opera had been performed there 330 times; by 1938, his centenary year, the total of performances at the theatre had reached 2,271. However, outside France the practice of using recitatives remained the norm for many years; the Carl Rosa Opera Company's 1947 London production, and Walter Felsenstein's 1949 staging at the Berlin Komische Oper, are among the first known instances in which <b>the</b> <b>dialogue</b> version was used other than in France. Neither of these innovations led to much change in practice; a similar experiment was tried at Covent Garden in 1953 but hurriedly withdrawn, and the first American production with spoken dialogue, in Colorado in 1953, met with a similar fate.|$|E

One thing the localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether it would be something that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for <b>the</b> <b>dialogue,</b> so that <b>the</b> <b>dialogue</b> still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Platonic <b>dialogues</b> {{serve as}} a {{launching}} point for any student of philosophy and are often used in other fields such as literature {{as a base for}} a specific type of writing and critical thinking. Plato is not the first philosopher; however, it is his dialogues that introduce many of the fundamental problems of philosophy and launched a foundational approach to philosophy, dialectic. Plato is also a primary focus of advanced scholars for both his historical position as a philosopher as well as the content found within his writings. Such scholars find themselves consumed with one perplexing question: how should we interpret <b>the</b> <b>dialogues?</b> This question arises because of the chronological confusion of when each dialogue was written and the seeming contradictions found between <b>the</b> <b>dialogues.</b> For instance, on the topic of death {{there seems to be a}} contradiction between the Gorgias and the Apology. In the Gorgias, Socrates states that we should fear death because of the judgment that takes place upon our death. However, in the Apology he states that we should not fear death because we do not have knowledge of it and therefore cannot assume that it is evil. In one dialogue we should fear death because we know what happens upon our death and in <b>the</b> other <b>dialogue</b> we should not fear death because we do not know what happens upon our death. How should we interpret <b>the</b> <b>dialogues?</b> Is there a contradiction? Did Plato change his mind? Interpretations have offered resolutions to the seeming contradictions of <b>the</b> <b>dialogues.</b> These modes of interpretations range from devising a religion of Socrates to chronologically ordering <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> and making a distinction between who is actually speaking, Plato or Socrates. Though these interpretations provide valuable and even plausible information concerning <b>the</b> <b>dialogues,</b> they also fall into problems of their own which leaves the lingering question of how to interpret <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> open for further examination...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{argues that}} Plato’s {{dialogue}} form creates a Quinean “opaque context” that segregates the assertions by Plato’s characters in <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> from both Plato {{and the real}} world {{with the result that}} <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> require a hermeneutical interpretation. Sec. I argues that since the assertions in <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> are located inside an opaque context, the forms of life of the characters in <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> acquires primary philosophical importance for Plato. The second section argues that the thesis of Sec. I coheres with the claim in Plato’s Seventh Letter that since philosophical truth is incommunicable by means of language it is of primary importance for philosophers to develop proper “schemes of living” (forms of life). Sec. III argues since the forms of life of the characters portrayed in <b>the</b> <b>dialogues</b> is of primary philosophical importance for Plato, and since hermeneutical methods are required to interpret emerging forms of life, Plato’s dialogues are positively crafted to be read hermeneutically.
