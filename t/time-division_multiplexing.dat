25|$|Muxponder: The muxponder (from {{multiplexed}} transponder) {{has different}} names depending on vendor. It essentially performs some relatively simple <b>time-division</b> <b>multiplexing</b> of lower-rate signals into a higher-rate carrier {{within the system}} (a common example {{is the ability to}} accept 4 OC-48s and then output a single OC-192 in the 1,550nm band).

25|$|Open L1OC and {{restricted}} L1SC signals are centered at 1600.995MHz, and open L2OC {{and restricted}} L2SC signals are centered at 1248.06MHz, overlapping with GLONASS FDMA signals. Open signals L1OC and L2OC use <b>time-division</b> <b>multiplexing</b> to transmit pilot and data signals, with BPSK(1) modulation for data and BOC(1,1) modulation for pilot; wide-band restricted signals L1SC and L2SC use BOC (5, 2.5) modulation for both data and pilot, transmitted in quadrature phase {{to the open}} signals; this places peak signal strength away from the center frequency of narrow-band open signals.|$|E
25|$|The type of {{modulation}} used {{is normally}} DE-QPSK, although DE-BPSK is used on the uplink (mobile to satellite) for acquisition and synchronization. Each time slot is 8.28 ms long and sits in a 90 ms frame. Within each FDMA channel there are four TDMA time slots in each direction. The TDMA frame starts off with a 20.32 ms period used for simplex messaging to devices such as pagers and to alert Iridium phones of an incoming call, followed by the four upstream slots and four downstream slots. This technique is known as <b>time-division</b> <b>multiplexing.</b> Small guard periods are used between time slots. Regardless of the modulation method being used, communication between mobile units and satellites is performed at 25 kilobaud.|$|E

Although these are not examples of exploiting multipath propagation to send multiple information streams, some of the mathematical techniques for dealing with mutual interference proved useful to MIMO development.

Prior to that, it was the only locomotive of its class to be painted in Network SouthEast livery, and was named 'Northampton Town'. In this guise it was used on London-Cambridge and London-Northampton passenger trains. In 2004, no. 86401 was preserved by the AC Locomotive Group, which also owns examples of Classes 81-85 (based at Barrow Hill Engine Shed). 86401 was initially deployed in the reserve fleet of operational shunting/depot service locomotives at Willesden TMD.

INTRODUCTION Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is a promising technique for providing high aggregate transmission rates on a single optical fibre. In WDM transmission, data from different users is modulated onto several optical carriers with different wavelengths. The optical carriers are then combined and transmitted on a single fibre. The transmission bandwidth available in WDM networks is limited by the gain bandwidth of opti [...] ...|$|R
