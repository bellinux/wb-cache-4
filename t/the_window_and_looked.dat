One of the {{students}} opened <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> out to see what was happening. Rb Ziv commented that he did not see that there was any possibility that that student would become an accomplished person.|$|E
2500|$|Jones' binge {{drinking}} {{and use of}} amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967 {{and he had to}} be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking. [...] Jones would go to extreme lengths for a drink if the thirst was on him. [...] Perhaps the most famous drinking story concerning Jones occurred while he was married to his second wife Shirley Corley. [...] Jones recalled Shirley making it physically impossible for him to travel to Beaumont, located 8 miles away, to buy liquor. Because Jones would not walk that far, she would hide the keys to each of their cars they owned before leaving. She did not, however, hide the keys to the lawn mower. [...] Upset, Jones walked to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> out over his property. [...] He later described his thoughts in his memoir: [...] "There, gleaming in the glow, was that ten-horsepower rotary engine under a seat. A key glistening in the ignition. I imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour. It might have taken {{an hour and a half}} or more for me to get to the liquor store, but get there I did." [...] Years later Jones comically mocked the incident by making a cameo in the video for [...] "All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight" [...] by Hank Williams Jr.. He also parodied the episode in the 1993 video for [...] "One More Last Chance" [...] by Vince Gill and in his own music video for the single [...] "Honky Tonk Song" [...] in 1996. Curiously, in her 1979 autobiography Stand By Your Man, Tammy Wynette claims the incident occurred while she was married to Jones, maintaining that she woke up at one o'clock in the morning to find her husband gone: [...] "I got into the car and drove to the nearest bar 10 miles away. When I pulled into the parking lot there sat our rider-mower right by the entrance. He'd driven that mower right down a main highway. [...] He looked up and saw me and said, ‘Well, fellas, here she is now. My little wife, I told you she'd come after me.’" ...|$|E

60|$|MARLOW. [Opening <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> out quietly.] It's Mrs. Jones's little boy, ma'am; he {{came here}} after his mother.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Half-past three,' muttered Mr Squeers, {{turning from}} <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> sulkily at <b>the</b> coffee-room clock. 'There will be nobody here today.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] she answered, {{turning her}} head away toward <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> out {{mechanically}} at the falling rain. [...] "Only my own thoughts." ...|$|R

60|$|I didn't like this, and I don't think Rectus did, either. He {{walked over}} to one of <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> out into <b>the</b> street.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> at <b>the</b> moon, Eddie," [...] {{suggested}} the girl. [...] "It's perfectly gorgeous tonight. Please, Eddie," [...] as he still hesitated.|$|R
6000|$|... [She runs to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> out at BASIL [...] and JOHN going away. FANNY appears [...] {{with the}} clothes. JENNY hurriedly puts [...] them on.|$|R
60|$|The woman ran to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> out. She {{stiffened}} as had Esther.|$|E

60|$|She {{turned from}} <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> thoughtfully at her widow's dress in the glass.|$|E

6000|$|Montalvo {{walked to}} <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> {{out of it}} remarked that {{he thought it was}} going to snow. Then {{suddenly}} he wheeled round, and staring hard at Lysbeth asked, ...|$|R
60|$|Fanny Elmer felt it to desperation. For {{he would}} take his stick and his hat and would walk to <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> {{perfectly}} absent-minded <b>and</b> very stern too, she thought.|$|R
60|$|She did not reply, and {{he walked}} to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> out on the garden.|$|E

6000|$|... "He is outside: I {{made the}} groom ride him, {{that you might}} see him. He had the side-saddle on {{for an hour or}} two yesterday. Come to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> at him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [He goes out. DICK {{continues}} {{to arrange the}} [...] flowers, than goes to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> [...] out. He comes back. The door is opened by [...] CHARLES, who announces MRS. CROWLEY.|$|R
60|$|Rufus {{walked to}} <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> out. The {{objections}} to Mr. Farnaby appeared to fail, so far, in interesting him.|$|E
60|$|Ruth {{sat down}} and rested her chin on her hand, staring at nothing. Kirk went to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> out.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Irwine {{started up}} from his chair, as if involuntarily, but then, {{determined}} to control himself, walked to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> out.|$|E
60|$|Trot was {{somewhat}} curious, too, so they crept {{up to one}} of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> in, <b>and</b> it so happened that those inside the witch's house were so busy they did not notice that Pon and Trot were watching them.|$|R
60|$|So they did, {{and so did}} {{the other}} people; for it was a boarding-house, and all the people were at home for dinner.
