5|$|On 9 July, a group {{representing}} Pakistani madrasahs, {{headed by}} Maulana Salimullah Khan, {{called for an}} immediate cessation of the Lal Masjid operation.

By 10 July, the Pakistani government reported that 100 militants and between 300 and 400 women and children remained inside the mosque.|$|E
5|$|Six years later, in 1518, the Kremers {{moved back}} to Rupelmonde, {{possibly}} motivated by <b>the</b> <b>deteriorating</b> conditions in Gangelt—famine, plague and lawlessness.

30|$|Paint loss can {{be caused}} by the {{deterioration}} of the adhesion materials and other diseases. When <b>the</b> adhesion materials <b>deteriorate,</b> <b>the</b> pigments can’t stick to each other or the plaster layer, then the paint layer drop gradually, especially on the murals with thinner pigment layer or less adhesion. In this investigation it is found that paint loss caused by <b>the</b> <b>deteriorated</b> adhesion material isn’t too much.|$|R

5|$|The {{division}} had by {{now been}} fighting almost continuously throughout the summer. According to divisional commander Hampel, {{it had been}} exhausted even before Operation Hackfleisch began. The cumulative effect of this exhaustion, <b>the</b> <b>deteriorating</b> situation that the Germans faced on all fronts and rumours probably spread among members by the Partisans and Ustaše, was that the division began to disintegrate in early September 1944.|$|E

Simultaneously, Sihanouk lost the support of Cambodia's conservatives {{as a result of his}} failure to come to grips with <b>the</b> <b>deteriorating</b> economic situation (exacerbated by the loss of rice exports, most of which went to the PAVN/Viet Cong) and with the growing communist military presence.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, a {{study on}} {{improving}} the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel by either building another tube or by constructing a bypass was carried out. Based on the study, the turnpike commission planned to replace <b>the</b> <b>deteriorating</b> tunnel with a cut through the mountain. The plans were put on hold in 2001 because it would cost $93.7 million. It resurrected the project in 2009. The nearby Mountain Field and Stream Club prefers that the tunnels are improved or a new tube is built rather than building the bypass. These improvements are needed because the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel is narrow and deteriorating, with disintegrating ceiling slabs and outdated lighting and ventilation.|$|E

5|$|Lindwall and Johnston {{extracted}} steep bounce {{with the}} new ball, troubling the English batsmen. Fielding in the slips, Lindwall dropped Hutton from Johnston's bowling before the English batsman had scored. Johnston usually moved {{the ball into the}} right-handed batsmen, but on this occasion the ball went straight on and took the outside of the edge of Hutton's bat. Hutton had trouble with both Australian pacemen, and played and missed multiple times in <b>the</b> <b>deteriorating</b> light. In a fidgety display, he played loosely outside the off stump and missed four times in one Johnston over, before Lindwall dismissed him.|$|E
5|$|On 17February 1941, the 6th Infantry Division was {{reformed}} in Egypt. It {{was initially}} {{made up of}} the 16th and the 22nd Guards Brigade, who were based in Egypt, but lacked artillery or other supporting arms. The 22nd Guards Brigade was soon withdrawn, and the division was assigned the 14th and 23rd Infantry Brigade. Here, the division trained for amphibious operations in the Dodecanese. <b>The</b> <b>deteriorating</b> situation in North Africa, which saw General Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps retake the territory lost by the Italians during Operation Compass, resulted in the 6th Infantry Division being reassigned to defend Egypt. The division had been earmarked to deploy to Crete, where the 14th Brigade had been based since November, but instead took up defensive positions at Mersa Matruh. The 14th Brigade later defended the airfield at Heraklion during the Battle of Crete when 2,000 German paratroopers landed in the area on 20May. The Germans were able to penetrate into Heraklion, before Anglo-Greek forces cleared the town following heavy fighting. Despite many losses, the paratroopers were able to dig-in on ridges around the brigade's positions. Due to <b>the</b> <b>deteriorating</b> situation on Crete, the 14th Brigade was evacuated by Royal Navy ships on 29 May. En route to Egypt, they were repeatedly bombed by the Luftwaffe, suffering 800 casualties.|$|E

5|$|The Bosnian War {{began in}} 1992, {{as a result}} of the breakup of Yugoslavia. <b>The</b> <b>deteriorating</b> {{situation}} led to United Nations Security Council Resolution 816 on 9October 1992, ordering a no-fly zone over central Bosnia and Herzegovina, which NATO began enforcing on 12April 1993 with Operation Deny Flight. From June 1993 until October 1996, Operation Sharp Guard added maritime enforcement of the arms embargo and economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 28February 1994, NATO took its first wartime action by shooting down four Bosnian Serb aircraft violating the no-fly zone.|$|E
5|$|The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords {{was awarded}} to 46 of the 328 Oak Leaves {{recipients}} of 1944.

The sequential numbers greater than 143 for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords are unofficial and were assigned by the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR) and are therefore denoted in parentheses. The recipients are ordered and numbered chronologically. The rank listed is the recipient's rank at the time the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves was awarded.|$|E

5|$|As weather {{conditions}} worsened, Royal Navy destroyers were {{only able to}} rescue 90 survivors from the three German ships. Before the rescue operation was suspended to engage TA 20, Wheatland {{pulled out of the}} sea three officers and 68 seamen—most of them crew of UJ 202. The Kriegsmarine sortied TA 40 and TA 45 corvettes as well as S 33 and S 154 E-boats to look for survivors, finding seventeen TA 20 crew members on the islet of Trstenik on 3 November. The group included seven wounded, tended by a local lighthouse crew. Besides them, the ships rescued one UJ 202 and three UJ 208 crew members from the sea. <b>The</b> <b>deteriorating</b> weather also prevented retrieval of the coast watchers for four days. More than two hundred Germans perished in this action, including the flotilla commander and all three ship commanding officers.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{construction}} of an embankment at nearby Bainbridge Street, the Pennsylvania Railroad was forced to build a new station at West High Street in 1900. After 15years, the Pennsylvania replaced the station. The new station was constructed out of Indiana Limestone in a similar style to the nearby Masonic Homes built by the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania. On July4, 1915, the Liberty Bell made a stop at the station while being transported to the PanamaPacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California. The Pennsylvania began electrifying its line between Philadelphia and Harrisburg in 1937, a task which was completed on January15, 1938. In 1977, <b>the</b> <b>deteriorating</b> station building was closed. Prior to the introduction of the Keystone Service in 1981, the Elizabethtown station was served by the Big Apple, the Silverliner Service, and the Keystone. From 1991 to 1995, the Atlantic City Express served the station on weekends. The Three Rivers made stops in Elizabethtown in 1995 and 1996.|$|E
