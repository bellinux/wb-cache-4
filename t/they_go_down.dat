5|$|The next day, Kay and Michael Brody are {{informed}} of Overman's disappearance. <b>They</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> in a submarine {{to look for}} his body, and during the search, they encounter a smaller shark. The dolphins rescue Kay and Mike, but the shark escapes back into the park. The news of the shark is disbelieved by Calvin Bouchard, the park manager, though it excites his hunter friend, Phillip FitzRoyce, who states his intention to kill the shark on network television. Kay protests and suggests capturing and keeping the shark alive in captivity, to guarantee more publicity for the park. The shark is successfully captured and Kay and her staff nurse it to health. Calvin, desperate to start the money rolling in immediately, orders it moved to an exhibit, but the shark dies.|$|E
25|$|Much {{the most}} celebrated {{features}} of the site today are the three large temples in the Archaic version of the Greek Doric order, dating from about 550 to 450 BC. All are typical of the period, with massive colonnades having a very pronounced entasis (widening as <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>down),</b> and very wide capitals resembling upturned mushrooms. Above the columns, only the second Temple of Hera retains most of its entablature, the other two having only the architrave in place.|$|E
500|$|Balthier {{says that}} he is to be the [...] "leading man" [...] of the story many times {{throughout}} the game, and insists that this makes him invincible, since the hero always emerges in one piece. He and Fran are feared dead after <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> with the Sky Fortress Bahamut, but later reappear to retrieve the Strahl from Vaan and Penelo and leave a note for Ashe.|$|E

500|$|Setting out at 5 a.m., {{they attempt}} to climb the East ridge. It becomes very hot. The rock is gritty with sharp flakes of mica. They pretend to be [...] "Damon Runyon {{characters}} trying to climb a mountain" [...] to cheer themselves up. They get better at roped climbing. After {{six and a half}} hours the altimeter shows 18,000 feet. They reckon they could reach the top if they tried a different gully and started at 4 a.m. <b>They</b> <b>go</b> <b>down.</b> Carless's hands are red and bleeding.|$|E
500|$|Jupiter, Mars and Apollo enter. [...] All of {{the actors}} flee in terror, except for Thespis. [...] Jupiter asks Thespis whether he is {{impressed}} with {{the father of the}} gods. [...] Thespis replies that the gods are unimpressive and suggests that <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> to earth in disguise to [...] "mingle" [...] and judge for themselves what people think of them. [...] They agree to invest the actors with their powers, as they take a merry holiday below on Earth. [...] Thespis agrees that he and his company will keep things running on Mount Olympus during the gods' absence. [...] Each actor takes the place of one of the gods, with Thespis himself replacing Jupiter. [...] Mercury stays behind to offer any advice the actors may need.|$|E
500|$|The unsafe {{homeless}} {{man with whom}} Peter was seen leaving a youth-baseball team in Stewie's flashback was originally based on John Wayne Gacy, but people claimed he didn't look scary enough, so Povenmire changed the character completely {{to that of a}} {{homeless man}}. The idea of Stewie and Bertram laughing as <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> the slide during their sword fight was pitched by Povenmire's wife and, although negative about the idea at first, Povenmire included it in the episode because the original sketch was not going so well. During Peter and Lois' [...] "fat sex", Peter repeatedly states [...] "almost, almost"; originally, {{there was going to be}} approximately twice as many of these, but they were never included in the episode. The DVD version of the episode shows Peter arriving at the sperm bank and saying to the receptionist: [...] "I have an appointment to banish a White Russian from my Kremlin", to which she replies with [...] "This is a sperm bank, you don't have to use innuendo", and Peter concludes the conversation with [...] "Where do I splooge?".|$|E

500|$|The video {{starts with}} a news anchor (played by Kristina Mitchell) saying {{the title of the}} song above a news banner that reads [...] "Britney Spears song lyrics spell out {{obscenity}} in disguise". This is a parody of an America's Newsroom report by Megyn Kelly. It then skips to a house, in which a sex party is coming to an end. Spears starts singing while {{sitting on the edge of}} a bed while the people that surround her are getting dressed. She gets up and looks out the window. As the first verse ends, she picks up a pair of panties from the floor, recalling her personal struggles and the [...] "Piece of Me" [...] video. She dances with four male dancers in the first chorus. During the second chorus, she dances with four other female dancers dressed in cheerleading outfits, while many men are watching them dance. The screen fades to white and Spears begins to change into a conservative '50s-inspired housewife outfit. As the chorus begins again, she comes out of her bedroom. She walks down the stairs, with dancers surrounding her and a woman gives her a potholder, which she uses to pick up a pie. After this, she walks out the front door of the house and is joined by her seemingly conservative-looking husband and children, one of them dressed with the schoolgirl outfit Spears wore in the [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] video. As <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> the walkway, they are surrounded by paparazzi, who have no idea what goes on behind closed doors. While the kids and husband wave, Spears smiles for the camera and blows a kiss. The video then ends with the news anchor saying, [...] "Doesn't make any sense, does it?".|$|E
2500|$|Ethan {{returns to}} the farm and picks up Mattie {{to take her to}} the train station. They stop at a hill upon which they had once planned to go sledding and decide to sled {{together}} as a way of delaying their sad parting. After their first run, Mattie suggests a suicide pact: that <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> again, and steer the sled directly into a tree, so they will never be parted and so that they may spend their last moments together. At first, Ethan refuses the plan, but, in his despair, he ultimately agrees. On the way down the hill, a vision of Zeena's face startles Ethan into swerving a bit, but he corrects their course, and they crash into the elm tree. Ethan regains consciousness after the accident, but Mattie lies beside him [...] "cheeping" [...] in pain like a small wounded animal. Ethan is also injured, and the reader is left to understand that this was the [...] "smash-up" [...] that left Ethan with a permanent limp.|$|E
2500|$|Pietraroja is {{the second}} comune by {{altitude}} (818 m above s.l.) of the province; it is limited to north from the western side, oasis of natural protection, of mount Mutria (1,823 m) in the southern chain of the Matese mounts (Apennines), to the border with comune [...] of Guardiaregia in the region Molise.
