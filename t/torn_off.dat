5|$|The note {{appears to}} have {{originally}} been signed, but the name was <b>torn</b> <b>off</b> or burned off so that her body could not be identified. When the announcement was printed in the local newspaper, The Cambrian, therefore, it did not refer to Imlay specifically.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{appendix}} {{marked in}} the index, which lists the Psalms of Solomon and probably contained more apocryphal/pseudepigraphical books, {{but it has}} been <b>torn</b> <b>off</b> and the pages containing these books have also been lost.|$|E
60|$|This {{letter is}} all upside down, and this first page written last; for I didn't like {{something}} I {{had written about}} myself last night when I was tired, and have <b>torn</b> it <b>off.</b>|$|R

"I thought so," [...] {{he said in}} a heavy voice; [...] "it is a {{fragment}} of that star-wrought veil which was my Christmas gift to Rosamund, and she has <b>torn</b> it <b>off</b> and left it here to show us her road. To St. Peter's-on-the-Wall! To St. Peter's, I say, for there the boats or ship must pass, and maybe that in the darkness they have not yet won out to sea." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reports from}} the crash site speculated that the Amana was already on fire when it struck the tops of trees because those trees, and pieces of the aircraft's left wing <b>torn</b> <b>off</b> in the impact with them, showed signs of scorching. Several eyewitnesses reported seeing flames in the sky before the aircraft struck the ground. Department of Civil Aviation investigators discounted this speculation because {{only one of the}} Amana's push-button engine fire extinguishers had activated and this had most likely occurred during the crash or the fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Lidia, in {{combination of a}} cold front, prompted a tornado watch and flash flood watch for much of Texas. In Texas, six tornadoes were reported, {{with one of them}} causing over $8million (1993 USD) in damage. The Dallas-Fort Worth area was hit hard. Strong winds, tornadoes and torrential downpours left broken trees, damaged buildings, and minor injuries {{in the wake of the}} storm. Johnson, Denton, Collin, Tarrant, and Dallas counties were the hardest hit. In northern Arlington, five people were injured when a roof was <b>torn</b> <b>off</b> of a hotel.|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{arms were}} {{swinging}} by her side, untied, while about {{twenty feet away}} swung the boy with his clothes partly <b>torn</b> <b>off</b> and his hands tided with a saddle string. The only marks on either body were that made by the ropes upon the necks. Gently swaying in the wind, the ghastly spectacle was discovered this morning by a negro boy taking his cow to water. Hundreds of people from Okemah and {{the western part of}} the county went to view the scene.|$|E

Mr. Wensome trod on my dress the other day, and apologized as though he'd <b>torn</b> it <b>off</b> my back, {{and the next day}} he gave me his seat in the car. I always {{acknowledge}} him, and he's glad enough to come and talk, but if his wife's with him, she looks straight ahead as though every one else in the car were mummies." ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the first}} night, Aran {{got up from}} his chair and killed the hawk and hound and ate them. On the second night he got up again from his chair, and killed the horse and tore it into pieces; then he took great bites at the horse-flesh with his teeth, the blood {{streaming}} down from his mouth all the while he was eating... The third night Asmund became very drowsy, and the first thing he knew, Aran had got him by the ears and <b>torn</b> them <b>off.</b>|$|R
5|$|According to {{generally}} accepted standards of respect, the national flag {{should never be}} dipped to any person or thing. Care {{should be taken to}} prevent the flag from touching the ground, floor or water beneath it. It should be also secured from being <b>torn</b> <b>off</b> or falling to the ground and it should not be flown outdoors during a heavy rain, blizzard or very strong wind. The flag should never be flown dirty, torn or faded. When no longer in a fit condition to be used, it should be disposed of in a dignified manner, preferably by cutting it in half so as to separate the colors and then, burning.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} caused {{severe damage}} along the Gulf Coast. Many marine vessels were blown ashore or sunken in Pensacola, and railroads {{in the city}} were severely damaged. Numerous wharfs were damaged or destroyed, and many roofs were <b>torn</b> <b>off</b> buildings. Three forts {{in the vicinity of}} Pensacola suffered damage. Electricity in the city was shut off. A total of 35 people were killed in Pensacola. Mobile and surrounding areas suffered similar damage, including destroyed timber, smashed windows, and sunken watercraft. In Mississippi, over 300,000 cotton bales were ruined during the hurricane, amounting to $12,000,000 in damage. Damage in New Orleans was minimal; however, Lake Pontchartrain overflowed, flooding the city. The hurricane killed a total of 134 people.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Varanasi {{was founded}} by the god Shiva. There {{happened}} a fight between the two supreme gods, Brahma and Shiva, and the succeeding combat resulted {{in one of the}} five heads of Brahma being <b>torn</b> <b>off</b> by Shiva. It was a custom of the time that the victor carried the slain adversary’s head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. The land of Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy religious site.|$|E
6000|$|Although uninjured by the shot, {{the poor}} Iroquois had not escaped scatheless from the paw of the bear. His scalp was <b>torn</b> almost <b>off,</b> and hung {{down over his}} eyes, while blood {{streamed}} down his face. He was conveyed by his comrades to the camp, where he lay two days {{in a state of}} insensibility, {{at the end of which}} time he revived and recovered daily. Afterwards when the camp moved he had to be carried, but in the course of two months he was as well as ever, and quite as fond of bear-hunting! ...|$|R
60|$|Whilst we {{were thus}} {{occupied}} somewhat automatically, for the shock had dazed us, the figure {{that had been}} propelled before the dancing door arrived, reeling in a drunken fashion, and through the dust and falling débris we knew it for that of Oliver Orme. His face was blackened, his clothes were <b>torn</b> half <b>off</b> him, and blood from a scalp wound ran down his brown hair. But {{in his right hand}} he still held the little electric battery, and I knew at once that he had no limbs broken.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, El Samurai {{adopted a}} new attire {{and won the}} Best of the Super Junior tournament, {{defeating}} Koji Kanemoto in the final match, during which his mask was <b>torn</b> completely <b>off</b> his face. The match was later given five stars by Wrestling Observer's Dave Meltzer. One month later, he defeated Liger to win the J-Crown, which at that time consisted of seven unified junior heavyweight championships due to Liger losing {{one of the eight}} titles (the WAR International Junior Heavyweight Championship) before the title match with El Samurai. In March 2001, he and Liger won the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship.|$|R
5|$|Across the Irrawaddy Delta, hurricane-force winds caused {{extensive}} damage to housing and infrastructure. Haigyi Island {{was the first}} area struck by the storm. Several homes were destroyed and many more lost their roof there. Thunderstorms from the storm's outer bands on April28 damaged 586homes in Hlaingthaya Township. Residents described {{what appeared to be}} a tornado as the cause of the damage. The Hlaingthaya industrial zone was hardest hit, with five factories destroyed and dozens of homes having their roof <b>torn</b> <b>off.</b> Locals, however, claimed that the damage was more severe than reported by the government. Cars were reportedly tossed into the air during the storm. Two people were killed and fourteen others were injured in Hlaingthaya. The winds also downed numerous power lines, leaving many without electricity. In Labutta Township, near the southern tip of the Delta, 88homes were destroyed. In the Hinthada District, torrential rains caused flash flooding that killed 18people and left 14others missing.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{hurricane}} remained near the coastline, Hurricane David failed to cause extreme damage in Florida. The storm's winds shattered windows in stores near {{the coast and}} caused property damage, including blowing {{the frame of the}} Palm Beach Jai Alai fronton and downing the 186-foot (57-m) WJNO AM radio tower in West Palm Beach into the Intracoastal Waterway. A few roofs were <b>torn</b> <b>off,</b> and numerous buildings were flooded from over six inches (150 mm) of rainfall. A 450-foot (140-m) crane was even snapped in two at the St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant. The hurricane spawned over 10 tornadoes while passing over the state, though none caused deaths or injuries. Total damages in Florida amounted to $95 million ($270 million in 2005 USD), of which $30 million occurred in Palm Beach County, mostly from crop damage. Two journalists with TODAY newspaper from Brevard County followed {{the hurricane}} path from South Florida to Cocoa, FL and experienced extremely high winds as they reported on the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In Jamaica, {{flooding}} {{was reported}} on {{the east of the}} island, and mudslides occurred on the northeast coast. In Kingston, buildings collapsed and houses had their roofing <b>torn</b> <b>off</b> by the strong winds, which felled trees and lampposts. A shoot-out between police and looters occurred in the parish of Clarendon. Over 1,500 roofs were lost, primarily to the hurricane-force winds. 3,127houses were heavily damaged, 1,582 of which were left totally uninhabitable. Two-thirds of the homes in the southeastern parishes of Clarendon, St. Catherine, and Kingston/St. Andrew sustained significant damages. One man was killed in Clarendon by a collapsing roof, and a 14-year-old girl in Whitehorses, St. Thomas was killed by rock damage to her home. A third Jamaican was killed when he was struck by flying debris {{during the height of the}} storm.|$|E

Also, I pray that I may be {{protected}} from Morella, {{that he may not}} be allowed to touch or even to speak to me, who, for all his rank and splendour, hate him as though he were some poisoned snake." ...|$|R
50|$|Today, Coffeyville's {{airfield}} {{remains in}} use {{and is the}} center of a growing industrial park. Most of the World War II buildings were sold <b>off,</b> <b>torn</b> down, although unlike some former World War II training fields, several original buildings remain in use, including the sub-depot and the three original squadron hangars. Many of the original streets remain.|$|R
50|$|The {{audience}} next sees Rusk {{at night}} carrying a large sack and lifting {{it into the}} back of a lorry among sacks of unsold potatoes bound for Lincolnshire. Rusk soon finds that his distinctive jeweled tie pin (with the initial R) is missing, and realises that Babs must have <b>torn</b> it <b>off</b> as he was murdering her. He climbs {{into the back of}} the lorry, but it starts off on its journey north. The killer desperately scrabbles through the sack of potatoes to find the dead woman's hand. Rigor mortis has set in, and he has to break her fingers in order to prise the pin from her grasp.|$|R
5|$|Minor {{damage was}} {{reported}} in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the Hudson River, the tornado entered Westchester County, where {{the worst of the}} damage took place. It struck the town of Sleepy Hollow, damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10-foot (3m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of Pocantico Hills was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby Comfort Inn had part of its roof <b>torn</b> <b>off.</b> After a tornado warning was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.|$|E
5|$|With Marengo {{damaged and}} Rainier {{actively}} hunting for his squadron, Linois {{withdrew from the}} Bay of Bengal and returned to Isle de France. Rainier knew that his chances of discovering Linois in the open Indian Ocean were insignificant, and instead decided to keep watch for him off his principal base at Port Napoleon. A squadron was detached to the port, but Linois's scouts discovered the blockade before he arrived {{and he was able}} to safely reach Grand Port instead on 31 October. Entering over the reefs that protected the anchorage, Marengos deeper keel scraped on the coral. The ship's hull was badly damaged and her rudder <b>torn</b> <b>off,</b> requiring extensive repairs. Linois was later joined by Captain Bruilhac in Belle Poule, who had captured a valuable merchant ship on his individual cruise in the Bay of Bengal.|$|E
5|$|At Al's apartment, Woody {{learns that}} he {{is based on a}} 1950s TV show called Woody's Roundup, and that along with the other Roundup toys—Jessie, Bullseye, and Stinky Pete the Prospector—he is set to be sold to a toy museum in Tokyo, Japan. While the others are excited about going, Woody intends to return home to Andy. Jessie {{explains}} that the museum is only interested in the collection if it is complete, and without Woody, they will be returned to storage. When Woody's arm is <b>torn</b> <b>off</b> completely, Woody attempts to retrieve it and escape, but is foiled when Al's television set turns on, and blames Jessie when he finds the TV remote in front of her. The next morning, Woody's arm is fixed by a toy repair specialist, and Woody learns that Jessie once belonged to a child named Emily, who eventually outgrew her and gave her away. Stinky Pete warns him that the same fate awaits him when Andy grows up, whereas he will last forever in the museum. Woody decides to stay, now believing that all toys will eventually get discarded by their owners.|$|E

At daybreak, a couple of our kids, bearded, dirty, skinny from hunger, slightly wounded by bayonets, clothes worn and <b>torn,</b> wack <b>off</b> three Jap heads and jam them on poles facing the 'Jap side' of the river ... The colonel sees Jap heads on the poles and says, 'Jesus men, what are you doing? You're acting like animals.' A dirty, stinking young kid says, 'That's right Colonel, we are animals. We live like animals, we eat and are treated like animals-what {{the fuck do you}} expect?' ...|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} I was too stunned to act. Then I hurled myself upon the man, {{as he sat}} with that placid smile of his upon his lips, and I would have torn his throat out had the three wretches not dragged me away from him. Again and again I made for him, panting and cursing, shaking off this man and that, {{straining}} and wrenching, but never quite free. At last, with my jacket <b>torn</b> nearly <b>off</b> my back and blood dripping from my wrists, I was hauled backwards in the bight of a rope and cords passed round my ankles and my arms.|$|R
50|$|Steven Parrino (1958 - 2005) was an American {{artist and}} {{musician}} associated with energetic punk nihilism. He {{is best known}} for creating big modernist monochrome paintings (his colors were limited to monochrome black (or black-and-white), orange, red, blue, and silver) that he violently slashed, <b>torn</b> or twisted <b>off</b> their stretchers. He died in a motorcycle traffic accident in Greenpoint, Brooklyn at the age of 46.|$|R
5|$|On September23 Janet passed {{directly}} between Grenada and Carriacou in the Grenadines, killing 122people in {{the island}} chain. An airport on Grenada was covered in debris strewn by the strong winds. Eight {{people were killed in}} a small town adjacent to the airport. Strong winds were also reported to have destroyed docks and warehouses, and unroofed a hotel in St. George's, Grenada. Houses were also unroofed, and balconies of government offices in St. George's were <b>torn</b> <b>off.</b> All bridges {{in the island}}'s interior regions collapsed, and spice crops sustained heavy damage. An estimated 75% of nutmeg plantations were destroyed, along with nearly all of the island's banana and cocoa crops. Three ships were also grounded in the local harbor. In The Carenage, the waterfront region of St. George's, debris was scattered and an 820ft (250m) pier collapsed. St. Vincent was mostly destroyed, and St. Lucia suffered significant coastal damage. Over $2.8million in damages were estimated throughout the Grenadines. Farther south, in Port of Spain, a church being used as a storm shelter collapsed, killing ten people.|$|E
5|$|One {{building}} at the Seventh Day Adventist church primary school collapsed while another sustained severe damage. Although damage occurred at Vaitau School, it was utilized as an evacuation shelter. The primary school and college in Araura also suffered damage. The island's electrically run water supply was substantially effected. A total of 568homes lost access to clean water, with many waters tanks damaged or destroyed. Aitutaki's only hospital fared well through the storm, with some roof damage and flooded rooms. Infrastructural losses totaled to NZ$2.3million (US$1.6million), mainly stemming from the power grid. The agricultural sector sustained extensive damage, amounting to US$1.5million, with some crops experiencing a total loss. The severity of damage raised concerns about food security {{in the months after}} the storm. Particularly hard-hit was the mango crop, which was to be harvested two weeks after Pat struck. Approximately 60–75percent of the coconut trees and 75percent of java plum, mango, and kapok trees sustained damage. Most trees had at least one branch <b>torn</b> <b>off</b> and in most cases, multiple branches. Additionally, the blue lorikeet (Vini peruviana), a bird native to French Polynesia and the Cook Islands, population suffered dramatic losses due to the storm, with the population on Aitutaki dropping by more than 50percent.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{flew into}} the mountain at an angle of 15 to 20 degrees, with the starboard side towards the mountain. The aircraft was ascending at a seven-degree angle, plus/minus one degree. The tip of the starboard wing {{was the first to}} hit the mountain, followed by engine number four (the right-most). The engine was immediately <b>torn</b> <b>off</b> and the aircraft started to rotate. The aircraft started being torn in the back rib of the starboard wing. Then the nose and port wing from engine number two (the inner) hit a depression in the mountain-face, causing engine number one to loosen from its nacelle and the port wing to break between the engines. At the same time the aircraft's body was broken in two. The aircraft's forward movement stopped, the wreck pieces rotated with the vertical stabilizer away from the mountain-side, the port wing caught on fire and exploded {{and the rest of the}} aircraft fell down the slope. On the way down, the starboard wing caught on fire.|$|E
50|$|The {{structures}} {{considered for}} potential reconstruction are the fibular collateral ligament, popliteus tendon, and popliteofibular ligament. The FCL and/or popliteus tendon are only considered for acute repair {{when they are}} avulsed off bone and can be reattached anatomically with the knee in extension. The PFL can be repaired when it is <b>torn</b> directly <b>off</b> of the fibular head and the popliteus is still intact. Reconstruction is preferred when the ligaments/tendons have mid-substance tears or other tears not amenable to repair. Reconstruction of either the FCL or popliteus tendon is typically completed utilizing a patient’s hamstring (semitendinous) for a graft; however when reconstructing both the FCL and popliteus an Achilles tendon graft from a cadaver is preferred.|$|R
6000|$|The missionary {{also gave}} us {{an account of the}} manner in which Christianity had been {{introduced}} among them. He said: [...] "When missionaries were first sent here, three years ago, a small vessel brought them; and the chief, who is now dead, promised to treat well the two native teachers who were left with their wives on the island. But scarcely had the boat which landed them returned to the ship than the natives began to maltreat their guests, taking away all they possessed, and offering them further violence, so that when the boat was sent in haste to fetch them away, the clothes of both men and women were <b>torn</b> nearly <b>off</b> their backs.|$|R
5000|$|While bench {{pressing}} a dumbbell weighing upwards of 180 lb (82 kg) in a gym in Georgia, the bench that Armstrong was lying upon broke, {{leading to the}} weight falling on his face. Armstrong's face was severely damaged and his nose was <b>torn</b> entirely <b>off,</b> and he required $38,000 USD worth of plastic surgery to repair it. While undergoing surgery, Armstrong donned a wrestling mask to conceal his disfigured features and began using the ring name [...] "The Bullet". As [...] "The Bullet", Armstrong feuded with the Stud Stable in Continental Championship Wrestling. He eventually discarded the mask after his surgeries were complete, but retained the nickname [...] "Bullet" [...] {{for the remainder of}} his career.|$|R
