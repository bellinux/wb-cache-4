The first was international terrorists, possibly the same group that had carried out <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> <b>bombing</b> two years earlier. The FBI also thought that a drug cartel might have been carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents as the building held a DEA office. The last hypothesis was that the bombing was done by anti-government right-wing radicals attempting to start a rebellion against the federal government.|$|E

Yasin was taken to the FBI's Newark field office in Newark, New Jersey, and was then released. The next day, he flew back to Iraq, via Amman, Jordan. Yasin was later indicted for the attack, and in 2001 he was placed on the initial list of the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists, on which he remains today. He disappeared before the U.S. coalition invasion, Operation Iraqi Freedom, in 2003. In March 1994, Salameh, Nidal Ayyad, Mahmud Abouhalima and Ahmad Ajaj were each convicted in <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> <b>bombing.</b> In May 1994, they were sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> <b>bombing</b> in New York City in February 1993 {{had caused}} {{bankruptcy}} in 40% {{of the affected}} companies within {{two years of the}} attack, according to a report from analysts IDC. As a result of the Baltic Exchange and Bishopsgate bomb attacks, City-based companies were well-prepared to deal with the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001, with a spokesman for the Corporation of London stating: [...] "After the IRA bombs, firms redoubled their disaster recovery plans and the City recovered remarkably quickly. It has left the City pretty well-prepared for this sort of thing now." [...] The initial estimate of £1 billion worth of damage was later downgraded, and the total cost of reconstruction was £350 million. The subsequent payouts by insurance companies resulted in them suffering heavy losses causing a crisis in the industry, including the near-collapse of the Lloyd's of London market. A government-backed insurance scheme, Pool Re, was subsequently introduced in Britain, with the government acting as a [...] "re-insurer of last resort" [...] for losses over £75 million.|$|E

When the Pakistani government helped the US arrest and extradite Ramzi Yousef {{for his role in the}} bombing (where Yousef hoped to kill 250,000 Americans by knocking one WTC tower over into the other) an outraged Siddiqui circulated the announcement with a scornful note deriding Pakistan for [...] "officially" [...] joining [...] "the typical gang of our contemporary Muslim governments", closing her email with a quote from the Quran warning Muslims not to take Jews and Christians as friends. She wrote three guides for teaching Islam, expressing the hope in one: [...] "that our humble effort continues ... and more and more people come to the [...] of Allah until America becomes a Muslim land." [...] She also took a 12-hour pistol training course at the Braintree Rifle and Pistol Club, mailed US military manuals to Pakistan and moved from her apartment after the FBI agents visited the university looking for her.|$|E

According to the journalist Steve Coll, Yousef mailed letters to various New York newspapers just before the attack, in which he claimed he belonged to [...] "Liberation Army, Fifth Battalion". These letters made three demands: an end to all US aid to Israel, an end to US diplomatic relations with Israel, and a pledge by the United States to end interference [...] "with any of the Middle East countries' interior affairs." [...] He stated that {{the attack on the}} World Trade Center would be merely the first of such attacks if his demands were not met. In his letters, Yousef admitted that <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> <b>bombing</b> was an act of terrorism, but this was justified because [...] "the terrorism that Israel practices (which America supports) must be faced with a similar one." ...|$|E
