5|$|Liu Kang is {{also one}} of the lead {{characters}} in the 1996 animated series , voiced by Brian Tochi. He is not the protagonist <b>therein</b> as opposed to the game storyline, instead sharing this role with several other Earthrealm heroes.|$|E
5|$|The act plainly has no application. The Indians here {{concerned}} do {{not belong}} to any of the classes described <b>therein</b> and their claims were in no way derived from the Spanish or Mexican governments. Moreover, it does not appear that these Indians were occupying the lands in question when the act was passed.|$|E
5|$|While Stalin's {{death in}} 1953 {{slightly}} relaxed tensions, {{the situation in}} Europe remained an uneasy armed truce. The Soviets, who had already created a network of mutual assistance treaties in the Eastern Bloc by 1949, established a formal alliance <b>therein,</b> the Warsaw Pact, in 1955.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} in South Africa, along with scriptures and {{philosophical}} texts of Hinduism and other Indian religions, Gandhi read translated texts of Christianity {{such as the}} Bible, and Islam such as the Quran. A Quaker mission in South Africa attempted to convert him to Christianity. Gandhi joined them in their prayers and debated Christian theology with them, but refused conversion stating he did not accept the theology <b>therein</b> or that Christ was the only son of God.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus madens, {{described}} by Ripley and Watson in 1963, {{is unusual in}} having some sexual dichromatism. If the Barbary falcon (see below) is considered a distinct species, it is sometimes placed <b>therein.</b> It {{is found in the}} Cape Verde Islands, and is non-migratory; it is endangered with only six to eight pairs surviving. Males have a rufous wash on crown, nape, ears, and back; underside conspicuously washed pinkish-brown. Females are tinged rich brown overall, especially on the crown and nape.|$|E

5|$|God by {{a sudden}} {{conversion}} subdued and brought my mind to a teachable frame, which was more hardened in such matters than {{might have been expected}} from one at my early period of life. Having thus received some taste and knowledge of true godliness, I was immediately inflamed with so intense a desire to make progress <b>therein,</b> that although I did not altogether leave off other studies, yet I pursued them with less ardour.|$|E
5|$|Review by appeal, by writ {{of error}} or otherwise, {{must be as}} {{prescribed}} by the act, and review by certificate {{is limited by the}} act to the certificate by the Circuit Courts, made after final judgment, of questions raised as to their own jurisdiction and to the certificate by the Circuit Courts of Appeals of questions of law in relation to which our advice is sought as <b>therein</b> provided, and these certificates are governed by the same general rules as were formerly applied to certificates of division.|$|E

This subduction process is responsible for the growth of the Chilean Andes and the volcanic and geothermal manifestations <b>therein.</b>|$|E
5|$|The film's opening voiceover from Wilton {{introduces}} its {{themes of}} chance and fate, which he characterises as simple luck, to him all-important. The sequence establishes the protagonist as an introvert, {{a man who}} mediates his experience of the world through deliberation, and positions the film's subjective perspective through his narrative eyes. Charalampos Goyios argued that this hero, as an opera lover, maintains a sense of distance from the outer world and that ramifications <b>therein</b> {{pale in comparison to}} the purity of interior experience.|$|E
5|$|White {{also played}} {{prominent}} role in his position as attorney general during the case of Elihu Gregg. Gregg had been convicted by the Preston County Circuit Court of burning the county courthouse and the public records <b>therein,</b> and causing {{the death of a}} janitress asleep in the courthouse {{at the time of the}} fire. Gregg was sentenced to death for these crimes, but following his sentence, he escaped to Greene County, Pennsylvania to the company of his friends and supporters, as the Gregg family was prominent in the region.|$|E
5|$|An {{accomplished}} woman, Finch gained {{her appointment}} as royal governess in August 1762 upon {{the birth of}} George, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of King George and Queen Charlotte. Finch's duties included oversight of the royal nursery and all the staff employed <b>therein,</b> as well as organising lessons for the children. Finch oversaw the princes' education until they became old enough to live in their own households under the watch of governors, while the six princesses remained under her supervision until they turned 21. Finch retired from her role in 1793, though she continued to correspond {{with members of the}} royal family and receive gifts from them.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} {{composition}} of the blazon is agreed to by both parties a final grant could then be created. This {{takes the form of a}} handmade colourfully illuminated and decorated Letters Patent. The letter is written and painted in vellum by a College artist and scrivener. The grant is then signed and sealed by the King of Arms, it is then handed to the petitioner, authorising the use of arms blazoned <b>therein</b> as the perpetual property of himself and his heirs. A copy of the grant is always made for the College's own register.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{introduces}} his Jamaican cousin Madame Claude to Peter, Joe, and Quagmire {{saying she}} is a psychic. Cleveland offers to have her read their palms and determine past lives they have had. Madame Claude then determines that Joe was once an octopus whose tentacles were bitten off by a shark, and Quagmire was Jack the Ripper. When Claude reads Peter's palm, she discovers that he was Griffin Peterson, the supposed founder of Quahog where the previously-mentioned history of Quahog was a myth. Most of the episode follows {{the story of this}} past life, the main characters <b>therein</b> having the appearance of regular Family Guy characters.|$|E
5|$|He is also {{credited}} with the writing of A Defence of Freemasonry (1765), also known as A Defence of Freemasonry as practised in the regular lodges, both foreign and domestic, under the Constitution of the English Grand Master, in which is contained a refutation of Mr. Dermott's absurd and ridiculous account of Freemasonry, in his book entitled 'Ahiman Rezon' and the several quries <b>therein</b> reflecting on the regular Masons, briefly considered and answered, that response to Laurence Dermott's Ahiman Rezon. Although {{there is no direct}} attribution on the text's titlepage, it was established as his work since its publication, and it includes a poem directly attributed to him.|$|E
5|$|In 1521, Portuguese {{explorer}} Ferdinand Magellan's expedition {{arrived in}} the Philippines, claimed the islands for Spain and was then killed at the Battle of Mactan. Colonization began when Spanish explorer Miguel LÃ³pez de Legazpi arrived from Mexico in 1565 and formed the first Hispanic settlements in Cebu. After relocating to Panay island and consolidating a coalition of native Visayan allies, Hispanic soldiers and Latin-American recruits, the Spaniards then invaded Islamic Manila, <b>therein</b> they put down the Tondo Conspiracy and exiled the conspirators to Guam and Guerrero. Under Spanish rule, they established Manila as {{the capital of the}} Spanish East Indies (1571).|$|E
5|$|In the {{footnotes}} to his 1873 compilation, Milne-Edwards correlated the subfossil {{species with}} parrots mentioned by Leguat. In 1875, A. Newton analysed Tafforet's then newly rediscovered account, and identified {{a description of}} the Rodrigues parrot <b>therein.</b> In a footnote in an 1891 edition of Leguat's memoir, the English writer Samuel Pasfield Oliver doubted that the parrots mentioned were the Rodrigues parrot, due to their smaller size, and suggested they may have been Newton's parakeet (Psittacula exsul). As Leguat mentioned both green and blue parrots in the same sentence, the English palaeontologist Julian Hume suggested in 2007 that these could either be interpreted as references to both the Rodrigues parrot and Newton's parakeet, or as two colour morphs of the latter.|$|E
5|$|It {{also has}} a more {{extensive}} classification of deposited snow than those that pertain to airborne snow. The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in the snow pack {{and the formation of}} ice <b>therein.</b> Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature.|$|E
5|$|On a 12-battle victory streak, Razer {{fought in}} the {{eleventh}} heat of the fifth series of Robot Wars. <b>Therein,</b> it defeated BigNipper, Widow's Revengea machine reportedly constructed by the Razer team's wivesand Rick to reach its first series semi-final. Their next opponent was Spawn Again, which was armed with a pneumatic flipper. Equipped with a new lower front wedge, Razer {{was able to get}} underneath Spawn Again and crush it until it broke down. In the quarter finals, Razer faced S3, a cylindrical robot with a vertical spinning blade. Razer's arm sliced into S3's weapon controls, stopping the disc, which allowed Razer to dominate the fight and win on a judges' decision.|$|E
5|$|The ancient traditions {{regarding}} Philip's Christianity can {{be divided}} into three categories: the Eusebian, or Caesarean; the Antiochene; and the Latin. The Eusebian tradition consists of Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea's Historia Ecclesiastica and the documents excerpted and cited <b>therein,</b> including the letters of Origen and Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria. The Antiochene tradition consists of the John Chrysostom's homily de S. Babyla and Leontius, bishop of Antioch's entries in the Chronicon Paschale. Most scholars hold that these accounts ultimately derive from Eusebius of Caesarea's Historia Ecclesiastica (Ecclesiastical History), but some, like Irfan ShahÃ®d, posit that Antioch had an independent oral tradition.|$|E
5|$|The codex {{has played}} a key role in the {{deciphering}} of Mayan hieroglyphs. Dresden librarian Ernst Wilhelm FÃ¶rstemann published the first complete facsimile in 1880. He deciphered the calendar section of the codex, including the Maya numerals used <b>therein.</b> FÃ¶rstemann determined that these numbers, along with deities and day names, related to the Mayan calendar and the Mayan Long Count calendar. In the 1950s Yuri Knorozov used a phonetic approach based on the De Landa alphabet for decoding the codex, which was followed up in the 1980s by other scholars that did additional deciphering based on this concept.|$|E
5|$|While {{equality}} jurisprudence primarily centres {{around a}} pledge of {{the protection of}} equal laws, laws frequently classify individuals out of necessity. Needless to say, {{the very idea of}} classification is premised on, and engenders, inequality. <b>Therein</b> lies the paradox of equality jurisprudence. The necessity of differentiation is even more paramount in modern society with its increasingly complicated problems. Joseph Tussman and Jacobus tenBroek have proposed the doctrine of reasonable classification as the solution, whereby the legislation defines the class that includes all who are similarly situated for the purpose of the law and none who are not.|$|E
5|$|While {{the number}} of license holders started to rise gradually, firearm sales rose even faster in 2015, mostly {{prompted}} by the EU efforts to restrict law abiding citizens' access to firearms. Average annual rise in {{the number of}} registered firearms amounted to 14,500 guns between 2006 and 2014, there were 54,508 new registered firearms in 2015 alone. Local tendencies generally follow the nationwide trend, however any worsening of security in any given district is often followed by a sharp rise in gun ownership <b>therein.</b> For example, in 2011, after a wave of racially motivated attacks by Romani perpetrators against majority population victims, there was a rise of gun ownership in Å luknov Hook area.|$|E
