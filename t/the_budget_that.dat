500|$|A smaller team reconvened {{during the}} morning of February 3, as Biller was {{preparing}} for work on the episode [...] "One", while Menosky was completing the script for [...] "Living Witness". There were general concerns about {{the pace of the}} episode being slowed by an exploration of the new ship and <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>that</b> such scenes would require. It was suggested that if the episode had a single guest star that this cost could be offset. Menosky and Biller joined the group after lunch, with the duo agreeing that the alien's ruse {{was going to be a}} problem, instead suggesting that the episode should be played [...] "straight" [...] with the main drama focused around the Janeway/Seven conflict. Braga took the work on the episode away, in order to work on it overnight. He later said that this was the first [...] "wall" [...] the writers had hit all season. In the early hours of February 4, Braga worked out how to fit everything together by having the episode become a retrospection of the entire season and called Menosky during the night to discuss it. The following day, Braga sent a beat-sheet crediting himself, Berman and Menosky as writers to the department heads on the show. This set the episode out in five acts, which appeared very similar to those in the final version. February 17 saw the delivery of a 68-page teleplay to production staff. The episode received the title [...] "Hope and Fear", and the alien vessel was named Dauntless. This name had originated from a conversation between Berman and Braga from over a year earlier, and it had been kept by Braga for a future purpose.|$|E
500|$|Throughout her career, Ayola {{has been}} outspoken {{on the subject}} of racial {{discrimination}} in the entertainment industry. Describing her motivation, she states: [...] "I am not an overtly political person. I just want fairness". Ayola believes that black actors receive less recognition than their white counterparts, explaining; [...] "If you get a show with six stars and one is black you are more likely to see interviews with the five white actors. [...] They are not being sold as a reason to watch." [...] She believes that her career would have taken her in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin, stating: [...] "I could not have played any of the roles I have played on TV if I was white [...] I am very aware of where the glass ceiling is and it's still very low and expectations are still very low". She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and Welsh to be a particular problem, explaining that: [...] "I get offered a lot of very different roles, but they're never Welsh. [...] The one time I was asked to play a Welsh character on screen was in Tiger Bay for BBC Wales, but I know if that series had been called Radyr Park or Cyncoed Close I wouldn't have been in it". In 2001, Ayola founded a production company and directed a short film entitled Persephone's Playground. She presented the film at the Cannes film festival, using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre, films and television. The project, however, was largely unsuccessful, with Ayola stating: [...] "it just made me decide that if there's anything I don't want to do, it's produce films, because I'm rubbish at it. I was so bad with <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>that</b> I just said yes to everything and then had to worry about how to pay for things at the end." [...] In 2008, Ayola offered her support to the [...] campaign Dignity! Period, aiming to provide affordable sanitary protection to Zimbabwean women.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1932, {{the budget}} {{submitted}} by Roosevelt would start moving money towards fast tracking construction of parkways on Long Island, as the Westchester parkway system {{was in full}} force. $1.08million was appropriated for the Northern State Parkway construction along with $92,000 for landscaping work out of the $9.5million requested for Long Island in total. However, in February, the state legislature cut down {{the amount of money}} on <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>that</b> Roosevelt had submitted. Instead of the $1.08million, which was cut from the budget, $200,000 was instead given to the Grand Central Parkway. Roosevelt slammed the decision by the Republican leaders in the Legislature as a [...] "cleverly disguised salary reduction program." [...] The cuts also included $15,000,000 for parkways and highways, which would break an agreement in 1929 that would go to the construction of facilities for motorists. In response, Moses and the LISPC went and applied for federal grants on July 18 to pay for the Northern State, along with other projects slashed in the budget. $1million was requested to pave both the Grand Central and Northern State.|$|E

Once he had decided upon making deeper cuts than he promised, Chrétien proved to be firm supporter of the new course, and supported Martin's cuts to other departments despite the complaints of the other ministers. Chrétien's advisor Eddie Goldenberg later recalled that Chrétien was unyielding {{in the face of}} efforts by other ministers to [...] "spare" [...] their departments, and that Chrétien kept on saying [...] "If I change anything, everything will unravel". In a 2011 interview, Chrétien recalled about the 1995 budget that: [...] "There would have been a day when we would have been the Greece of today. I knew we were in a bind and we had to do something." [...] In order to silence objections from left-wing Liberal backbenchers and Cabinet ministers, Chrétien ensured that the Program Review Committee chaired by Marcel Massé that would decide what programs to end and which to cut had a majority comprising the leftist MPs Brian Tobin, Sheila Copps, Sergio Marchi and Herb Gray, people who would not normally supporting cutting programs, and thereby underlined the seriousness of the crisis.

2500|$|Goh {{was a key}} {{member of}} the PAP's Central Executive Committee, and later became its vice-chairman. Goh {{successfully}} contested the Kreta Ayer seat in the 1959 general election, {{was elected to the}} Legislative Assembly on 30 May, and joined the first government of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew as Minister for Finance. In this role, he assumed stewardship of Singapore's economy. As a budget deficit of S$14 million was forecast that year, he introduced stringent fiscal discipline which including cutting civil service salaries. As a result of these measures, he was able to announce {{at the end of the}} year when delivering <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>that</b> the Government had achieved a surplus of $1 million. He initiated the setting up of the Economic Development Board which was established in August 1961 to attract foreign multinational corporations to invest in Singapore. The next year, he started the development of the Jurong industrial estate on the western end of the island which was then a swamp, offering incentives to local and foreign business to locate there. According to former Permanent Secretary Sim Kee Boon, Goh admitted that the Jurong project was [...] "an act of faith and he himself jokingly said that this could prove to be Goh's folly". Nonetheless, Goh also felt strongly that [...] "the only way to avoid making mistakes is not to do anything. And that... will be the ultimate mistake." ...|$|E
2500|$|The project {{itself was}} a well-kept secret, and very little was ever {{revealed}} about the car's specifications. One thing that Alfa Romeo did reveal was that it used the 3.5-litre Tipo 1035 V10 engine from the still-born Alfa Romeo 164 Procar; this was a naturally aspirated 72 degree V10 originally designed for the Ligier Formula One team, and produced a claimed output of [...] at 13,300 RPM. It is believed that the car was built in 1990, as it had a much simpler rear wing than those found on cars built for the 1991 World Sportscar Championship season, but no official build date was given. MOMO's founder Gianpiero Moretti had apparently been in talks with Alfa Romeo about using the SE 048SP, but these {{did not result in}} any deal being made. As a result, although at least one SE 048SP was built, the car never left the development phase, and never raced. It ended up in Alfa Romeo's Museo Storico, but made a public appearance at the 2010 Goodwood Festival of Speed, where it appeared to be fitted with a 3.5-litre Ferrari V12 engine, producing a claimed output of [...] at 12,750 RPM. This may have been because the V10 engine had proved fragile in the [...] "Abarth SE047", which was a re-engined Lancia LC2 used as a test-bed for the SE 048SP project. <b>The</b> <b>budget</b> <b>that</b> the SE 048SP would have used, in combination with the money used in Lancia's WRC programme, were used instead on the Alfa Romeo 155 touring car programme, which saw Alfa Romeo win numerous national championships, most notably the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft in 1993, and the British Touring Car Championship in 1994.|$|E
