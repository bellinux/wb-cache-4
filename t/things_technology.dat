2500|$|According to the Business Insider Intelligence Survey {{conducted}} {{in the last quarter}} of 2014, 39% of the respondents said that security is the biggest concern in adopting Internet of <b>things</b> <b>technology.</b> In particular, as the Internet of things spreads widely, cyber attacks are likely to become an increasingly physical (rather than simply virtual) threat. In a January 2014 article in Forbes, cyber-security columnist Joseph Steinberg listed many Internet-connected appliances that can already [...] "spy on people in their own homes" [...] including televisions, kitchen appliances, cameras, and thermostats. Computer-controlled devices in automobiles such as brakes, engine, locks, hood and trunk releases, horn, heat, and dashboard have been shown to be vulnerable to attackers who have access to the on-board network. In some cases, vehicle computer systems are Internet-connected, allowing them to be exploited remotely. By 2008 security researchers had shown the ability to remotely control pacemakers without authority. Later hackers demonstrated remote control of insulin pumps and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. David Pogue wrote that some recently published reports about hackers remotely controlling certain functions of automobiles were not as serious as one might otherwise guess because of various mitigating circumstances; such as the bug that allowed the hack having been fixed before the report was published, or that the hack required security researchers having physical access to the car prior to the hack to prepare for it.|$|E
50|$|With the {{commercial}} availability of cloud computing, SCADA systems have increasingly adopted Internet of <b>things</b> <b>technology</b> to significantly reduce infrastructure costs and increase {{ease of maintenance}} and integration. As a result, SCADA systems can now report state in near real-time and use the horizontal scale available in cloud environments to implement more complex control algorithms than are practically feasible to implement on traditional programmable logic controllers. Further, the use of open network protocols such as TLS inherent in the Internet of <b>things</b> <b>technology,</b> provides a more readily comprehensible and manageable security boundary than the heterogeneous mix of proprietary network protocols typical of many decentralized SCADA implementations. One such example of this technology is an innovative approach to rainwater harvesting through the implementation of real time controls (RTC).|$|E

40|$|Supply-demand {{systems in}} Smart City sectors such as energy, transportation, telecommunication, are subject of {{unprecedented}} technological transformations by the Internet of Things. Usually, supply-demand systems involve actors that produce and consume resources, e. g. energy, {{and they are}} regulated such that supply meets demand, or demand meets available supply. Mismatches {{of supply and demand}} may increase operational costs, can cause catastrophic damage in infrastructure, for instance power blackouts, and may even lead to social unrest and security threats. Long-term, operationally offline and top-down regulatory decision-making by governmental officers, policy makers or system operators {{may turn out to be}} ineffective for matching supply-demand under new dynamics and opportunities that Internet of <b>Things</b> <b>technologies</b> bring to supply-demand systems, for instance, interactive cyber-physical systems and software agents running locally in physical assets to monitor and apply automated control actions in real-time. e. g. power flow redistributions by smart transformers to improve the Smart Grid reliability.
