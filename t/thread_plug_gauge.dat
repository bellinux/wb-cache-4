40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} a novel optical <b>thread</b> <b>plug</b> <b>gauge</b> (OTPG) for internal thread inspection using machine vision. The OTPG {{is composed of}} a rigid industrial endoscope, a charge-coupled device camera, and a two degree-of-freedom motion control unit. A sequence of partial wall images of an internal thread are retrieved and reconstructed into a 2 D unwrapped image. Then, a digital image processing and classification procedure is used to normalize, segment, and determine {{the quality of the}} internal thread. The proposed OTPG provides an orientation-free and convenient method for detecting defects such as scratches, collapses, and flaws in an internal thread. Keywords Internal thread. Rigid industrial endoscope. Machine vision. Directional texture. Fourier-based image restoration scheme...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} a methodology for modelling {{the control of}} a <b>threaded</b> <b>plug</b> <b>gauge.</b> There had been examined works of scientists who had studied the aspects of the average thread diameter control and studied the problems of providing and {{improving the quality of}} threaded joints. At a modern machine-building enterprise, threaded gauges are important in controlling threaded joints of parts. There had been built a functional model of the caliber life-cycle. The article shows possible applications of threaded gauges and examines the method of automating the average thread diameter control on a universal three-axis measuring video microscope. The application of this method is expedient in the conditions of modern production, since that usage reduces time expenses and requirements for the operators' qualification, as well as increases the reliability {{of the results of the}} average thread diameter control...|$|R

50|$|Similar {{to gauge}} blocks, these are precision-ground {{cylindrical}} bars, {{for use as}} <b>plug</b> <b>gauges</b> to measure hole diameters, or as parts of go/no go gauges or similar applications.|$|R
50|$|Valves {{are used}} to {{redirect}} flows through pipes. Two types of valves used in laboratory glassware are the stopcock valve and the <b>threaded</b> <b>plug</b> valve. These and other terms used below are defined in detail since they are bound to conflict with different sources.|$|R
50|$|<b>Threaded</b> <b>plug</b> valves {{are used}} {{significantly}} in air-sensitive chemistry {{as well as}} when a vessel must be closed completely {{as in the case}} of Schlenk bombs. The construction of a <b>threaded</b> <b>plug</b> valve involves a <b>plug</b> with a <b>threaded</b> cap which are made so that they fit with the threading on a corresponding piece of female glass. Screwing the plug in part-way first engages one or more O-rings, made of rubber or plastic, near the plug's base, which seals the female joint off from the outer atmosphere. Screwing the plug valve all the way in engages the plug's tip with a beveled constriction in the glass, which provides a second seal. This seal separates the region beyond the bevel and the O-rings already mentioned.|$|R
50|$|Go/no go gauges are {{encountered}} in {{all types of}} manufacturing. They may measure a physical dimension, e.g. (50 ±0.01mm), or a value such as {{the value of a}} resistor (100Ω (ohms) ±1%).A typical example is a <b>plug</b> <b>gauge.</b>|$|R
50|$|Used {{to place}} and recover {{wellbore}} equipment, such as <b>plugs,</b> <b>gauges</b> and valves, slicklines are single-strand non-electric cables lowered into {{oil and gas}} wells from the surface. Slicklines {{can also be used}} to adjust valves and sleeves located downhole, as well as repair tubing within the wellbore.|$|R

50|$|Go ring gauges {{provide a}} {{precision}} tool for production comparative gauging {{based on a}} fixed limit. Go gauges consist of a fixed limit gauge with a gauging limit based on the plus or minus tolerances of the inspected part. A go ring gauge's dimensions {{are based on the}} maximum OD tolerance of the round bar or part being <b>gauged.</b> A go <b>plug</b> <b>gauge's</b> dimensions are based on the minimum ID tolerance of the hole or part being <b>gauged.</b> The go <b>plug</b> (ID) <b>gauge</b> should be specified to a plus gaugemakers' tolerance from the minimum part tolerance. The go ring (OD) gauge should be specified to a minus gaugemakers' tolerance from the maximum part tolerance.|$|R
5000|$|On 4 October 2005, a team {{of track}} {{maintenance}} staff was working {{by a set of}} points at Kelvedon when the 13:30 passenger train from [...] to Liverpool Street passed through the station. The team had taken refuge in a place of safety as the train passed, but one of them was injured by a steel <b>threaded</b> <b>plug</b> which flew off the moving locomotive, which was travelling at speed. The worker suffered a fracture to his skull and injury to his hand.|$|R
50|$|On {{reassembly}} {{care should}} be taken that the <b>threaded</b> <b>plugs</b> are replaced in their original holes: the tapers can vary {{as a result of}} rethreading. The mudhole door gaskets, if of asbestos, should be renewed but those made of lead may be reused; special instructions are in force for the disposal of these harmful materials. At large maintenance facilities the boiler would have been both washed and refilled with very hot water from an external supply to bring the locomotive back to service more quickly.|$|R
50|$|While {{rounding}} out {{a line of}} vacuum pumps and compressors and of creating a demand for the pumps was slow. A micrometer <b>plug</b> <b>gauge,</b> another invention of Nash's, was made and generated enough profits to keep the company afloat. In 1912, a steady demand had been found for the pumps, and {{the first floor of}} the present building on Wilson Point Road was erected. The building was designed and built entirely from his plans and figures of Nash.|$|R
5000|$|A spark <b>plug</b> gap <b>gauge</b> is a disc with {{a sloping}} edge, or with round wires of precise diameters, {{and is used}} to measure the gap. Use of a feeler gauge with flat blades instead of round wires, as is used on {{distributor}} points or valve lash, will give erroneous results, due to the shape of spark plug electrodes. The simplest gauges are a collection of keys of various thicknesses which match the desired gaps and the gap is adjusted until the key fits snugly. With current engine technology, universally incorporating solid state ignition systems and computerized fuel injection, the gaps used are larger on average than in the era of carburetors and breaker point distributors, to the extent that spark <b>plug</b> <b>gauges</b> from that era cannot always measure the required gaps of current cars. [...] Vehicles using compressed natural gas generally require narrower gaps than vehicles using gasoline.|$|R
50|$|Accessories or Backshells are {{mechanical}} devices (e.g., strain reliefs, cable clamps, adapters, potting boots) {{that are}} threaded onto the rear connector accessory <b>threads</b> of <b>plug</b> or receptacle connectors {{to make up}} the total connector assembly.|$|R
5000|$|In machining, {{where the}} thou is often {{treated as a}} basic unit, 0.0001 inches can be {{referred}} to as [...] "one tenth", meaning [...] "one tenth of a thou". (The metric comparison is discussed below.) Machining [...] "to within a few tenths" [...] is often considered very accurate, and at or near the extreme limit of tolerance capability in most contexts. Greater accuracy (tolerance ranges inside one tenth) apply in only a few contexts: in <b>plug</b> <b>gauge</b> and gauge block manufacturing or calibration, they are typically expressed in millionths of an inch or, alternatively, in micrometres; in nanotechnology, nanometres or picometres are used.|$|R
50|$|Older, green coloured, {{suspension}} spheres typically last between 60,000 and 100,000 km. Spheres {{once had}} a <b>threaded</b> <b>plug</b> on top for recharging. Newer spheres do not have this plug, {{but it can be}} retrofitted enabling them to be re-gassed. The sphere membrane has an indefinite life unless run at low pressure, which leads to rupture. Timely recharging, approximately every 3 years, is thus vital. A ruptured membrane means suspension loss at the attached wheel, however, ride height is unaffected. With no springing other than the (slight) flexibility of tyres, hitting a pothole with a flat sphere can bend the suspension parts or dent a wheel rim. In the case of main accumulator sphere failure, the high pressure pump is the only source of braking pressure for the front wheels. Some older cars had a separate front brake accumulator on power steering models.|$|R
5000|$|For {{situations}} where more firepower was necessary, the concealable pistol was modified {{to accept a}} barrel extension with hand-grip and silencer, a Phantom Bushnell pistol scope, an extended magazine and a collapsible shoulder stock. The bird cage suppressor, silencer and barrel extension were attached by <b>threaded</b> <b>plugs.</b> Though a sophisticated weapon on screen, the U.N.C.L.E. Special Carbine in reality could not shoot real bullets, only blanks. However the pistol alone was still a working firearm. It was also modified by the studio {{to allow it to}} fire in full automatic [...] "machine gun" [...] mode. Unfortunately, this caught the attention of the US Treasury Department- the manufacture of automatic weapons without a license is very illegal, and the show nearly had the guns confiscated. In the end MGM was fined $2000 and the matter was closed.|$|R

The lower {{image is a}} plain <b>plug</b> <b>gauge</b> used to check {{the size of a}} hole; the green end is the go, and the red end is the no-go. The {{tolerance}} of the part that this gauge checks is 0.30 mm, where the lower size of the hole is 12.60 mm and the upper size is 12.90 mm, every size outside this range is out of tolerance. This may be initially expressed on the parts drawing in a number of styles; three possibilities may be ...|$|R
5000|$|Snap gauges {{are often}} used when a large {{quantity}} of work pieces must be inspected. The snap gauge has four anvils or jaws, the first one or pair (outermost) are set using the upper limit (tolerance) of the part and the inner set adjusted to the lower limit of the part. A correctly machined part will pass {{the first set of}} jaws and stop at the second [...] - [...] end of test. In this manner, a part may be checked in one action, unlike the <b>plug</b> <b>gauge</b> that needs to be used twice and flipped to access the second gauge. The first go/no-go snap gage for checking thread rolls was invented in 1943 to speed production of parts during WWII.|$|R
50|$|Gauge blocks {{are usually}} made either from {{hardened}} alloy tool steels or from cemented carbides (such as tungsten carbide or tantalum carbide). Often the carbide has a hardness of 1500 Vickers hardness. Long series blocks {{are made from}} high-quality steel having cross section (35 × 9 mm) with holes for clamping two slips together. These are also available in carbon steel material. Steel blocks are hardened and tempered. The hardness {{is important because it}} slows down the gauge's rate of wear during use (this is why other kinds of gauges, such as pins, <b>thread</b> <b>plugs,</b> and rings, are also hardened.) The cutting of the blocks to size is accomplished with grinding followed by lapping. Usually no plating or other coating is involved. Blocks are kept very lightly oiled, and are stored and used in dry climate-controlled conditions; unplated, uncoated steel gauge blocks can last for decades without rusting.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Mk 2 grenade had a 3/8-inch (9.6 mm) <b>threaded</b> <b>plug</b> in its base, which {{covered the}} opening used {{to place the}} explosive filling, either 1.85 oz (52 g) of TNT, 2.33 oz (66 g) of Trojan explosive (a mixture of 40% nitrostarch, ammonium nitrate, and sodium nitrate), 1.85 oz (52 g) of a 50/50 amatol/nitrostarch mixture, or 1.85 oz (52 g) of Grenite (a mixture of 95% nitrostarch and binders). Some early Mk 2 grenades were filled with 0.74 oz (21 g) of smokeless EC powder. The improved [...] "Mk 2A1" [...] (a designation used informally by armorers, historians, and collectors but was never officially by the US military) introduced in 1942 was filled through the fuse well instead. The Mk 2A1 was initially filled with 0.74 oz (21 g) of EC powder. In 1944, the EC powder filling was replaced with 1.85 oz (52 g) of TNT.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} form {{of quality}} control was {{a sketch of}} the desired item. If the sketch did not match the item, it was rejected, in a simple Go/no go procedure. However, manufacturers soon found it was difficult and costly to make parts be exactly like their depiction; hence around 1840 tolerance limits were introduced, wherein a design would function if its parts were measured to be within the limits. Quality was thus precisely defined using devices such as <b>plug</b> <b>gauges</b> and ring gauges. However, this {{did not address the}} problem of defective items; recycling or disposing of the waste adds to the cost of production, as does trying to reduce the defect rate. Various methods have been proposed to prioritize quality control issues and determine whether to leave them unaddressed or use quality assurance techniques to improve and stabilize production.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:-AISI D 3 {{tool steel}} is a high-carbon, highchromium, oil-hardening tool steel that is {{characterized}} by a relatively high attainable hardness and numerous, large, chromium-rich alloy carbides in the microstructure. These carbides provide good resistance to wear from sliding contact with other metals and abrasive materials. Typical applications for D 3 tool steel include Blanking, stamping, and cold forming dies and punches for long runs; lamination dies, Bending, forming, and seaming rolls, Cold trimmer dies or rolls, Burnishing dies or rolls, <b>Plug</b> <b>gauges,</b> Drawing dies for bars or wire. In this paper the microstructure of D 3 tool steel is observed before and after heat treatment and surface roughness in D 3 is investigated after EDM. For this set of experiments three different tool electrodes are taken and the result shows the variation of Ra value with respect to discharge current.

5000|$|The metal case/shell (or the jacket, as {{many people}} call it) of the spark plug withstands the torque of {{tightening}} the plug, serves to remove heat from the insulator and {{pass it on to}} the cylinder head, and acts as the ground for the sparks passing through the central electrode to the side electrode.

To analyze the RME construction work need to know elastomer mechanical modules. In work it is offered to define factor of Poisson's ratio from experiments on axial compression of multilayered packages from thin-layer elastomer layer. To exclude influence of ruggedness of experimental installation on the indication of devices, it is offered to select number of layers in a package and geometrical parameters elastomer layers so that deposit of a layer at the expense of change of its form and compressibility elastomer, were one order. For processing of experimental data it is offered to use analytical decisions ("force-settlement") for a package from thin elastomer layers. The calculation example confirms applicability of the considered technique for definition of factor of Poisson's ratio for elastomer...|$|R

30|$|In 1946, Chambers [35, 36] {{described}} {{for the first}} time the concept of arthroereisis for pathologic pronation of the foot. He believed that the excessive eversion would be limited by elevating the sinus tarsi floor with an autogenous bone graft under the leading edge of the calcaneus posterior facet. In 1970, LeLièvre [35] employed autogenous bone grafts within the sinus tarsi to limit pronation, using a free-floating bone graft obtained from the base of the proximal phalanx, which was then resected as part of the hallux valgus repair. This author was the first to introduce the term “lateral arthroereisis” [35]. In 1983, Smith and Millar [37] first described the subtalar arthroereisis-peg procedure, using a device made of ultrahigh molecular-weight polyethylene. Other devices which have been used include a <b>threaded</b> polyethylene <b>plug</b> inserted into the sinus tarsi, described by Giannini in 1985 [38], and a champagne glass-shaped silicon implant, described by Viladot in 1992 [21].|$|R
