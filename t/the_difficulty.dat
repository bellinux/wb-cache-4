The reasons for <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> include cognitive load involved in programming, different learning styles of students, instructional methodology and {{the choice of the}} programming languages. To reduce <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>the</b> following have been tried: pair programming, program visualization, different learning styles etc. However, these efforts have produced limited success.

40|$|Managing {{class of}} young {{learners}} {{is not an}} easy thing compared to adult learners, because they have different needs, interest, and abilities (Halimi, 2010). This study was focused on describing <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> faced by <b>the</b> teachers in managing class of EYL students in the first grade class and the way to overcome <b>the</b> <b>difficulties.</b> In conducting this study, the researcher used descriptive qualitative research design. The subjects of this study were six teachers of EYL students in the first grade class at English Department of University of Muhammadiyah Malang. The instruments used by the researcher to collect the data were observation note and interview guide. In this study, the researcher found four difficulties that were faced by the teachers, such as: the studentsÂ’ misbehavior, <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> in giving instruction, <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> in grouping <b>the</b> students, and the messy classroom. To cope with <b>the</b> <b>difficulties,</b> <b>the</b> teachers applied several ways. First, in overcoming <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> in managing <b>the</b> studentsÂ’ misbehavior, the teachers applied eight ways, such as: mentioning the classroom jargon, using non-direct verbal intervention, using non- verbal intervention, using direct verbal intervention, the main teacher was assisted by co-teachers, giving effective warnings, showing picture stories, and the teacher personally approaching the students. Second, to solve <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> in giving instruction, the teacher applied three ways, such as: the main teacher was assisted by co-teachers, translating instruction into Bahasa, and giving example. Third, to overcome <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> in grouping students, the teachers applied two ways, they are: the main teacher was assisted by co-teachers and the teacher did not fulfil the studentsÂ’ wish. The last, to solve the messy classroom, the teacher was assisted by co-teachers. However, the researcher acknowledges that there are misunderstanding between the theory and the result. The researcher aware that <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> that are caused by the young learners are natural, because the young learners are different compared to adult learners...|$|R
