40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present a}} {{specially}} designed materials chemistry that provides ultrathin adhesive layers with persistent <b>tacky</b> <b>surfaces</b> in solid, nonflowable forms for use in transfer printing and related approaches to materials and micro/nanostructure assembly. The material can be photocured after assembly, to yield a robust and highly transparent coating that is also thermally and electrically stable, for applications in electronics, optoelec-tronics, and other areas of interest. Advanced electronic materials and printing processes haveenabled rapid advances in functional capabilities for flexible electronics, 1 − 6 biointegrated devices, 7 − 9 {{and other types of}} emerging systems. A high speed, deterministic method for assembly, sometimes known as transfer printing, has become popular in these and related fields due to its ability to heterogeneously integrate multiple types micro/nanoscale materials in sparse or dense coverages, over large or small areas, in two- or three-dimensional layouts, on nearly any class o...|$|R

50|$|A finish or {{dressing}} is {{most often}} applied for aesthetic reasons rather than conservation. When a dressing is applied it may brighten an object and give a new sheen to the leather without ever contributing {{to the preservation of}} the object, in some instances this may lead to conservation problems. Therefore, any applied finishes should be carefully considered and studied before placing on an object for conservation. Dressing or finishes may absorb dirt creating a <b>tacky</b> <b>surface.</b> Some may contain inappropriate ingredients or over application may lead to spewing. Spewing is the rise of white deposits of free fatty acids to the leather surface which is often mistaken for mold.Dressings should never be applied to painted leather of any kind. The oils and fats can permanent discoloration and softening of the varnishes. Application of this kind may not happen immediately and should not lead to a belief that it will be successful in the following months or years. Previous removal of over-varnish utilized the same materials as the original varnish, which led to stripping the entire varnish coat. In modern leather preservation the original surface coating may be stripped completely off to provide a uniform replacement finish. It is not advised for this method on historical pieces but is highly appropriate on reproductions and modern leather-works as they may prolong the life of the material without compromising the historical value or integrity.|$|E
40|$|While {{adhesiveness}} {{is required}} for polymer surfaces in special applications, <b>tacky</b> <b>surfaces</b> are generally undesirable in many applications like automotive interior parts. The tackiness of polymer surface results {{from a combination of}} composition and additivation, and it can change significantly in natural or accelerated ageing. Since there is no established, uniform method to characterize surface tack, the major focus of the present work was on the development of an objective quantification method. A setup having a soft die tip attached to a standard tensile tester was developed aiming for correlation to the human sense of touch. Three different model thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) compound formulations based on a high-impact isotactic polypropylene (iPP) composition with varying amounts and types of anti-scratch additives were used for these investigations. As the surface tack phenomenon is related to ageing and weathering, the material&# 8217;s examination was also performed after various intervals of weathering. The developed method allows a fast assessment of the effect of polymer composition variations and different additive formulations on surface tack and gives identical rankings as the standardized haptic panel...|$|R
40|$|Bioinspired {{artificial}} surfaces with tailored {{adhesive properties}} have attracted significant interest. While fibrillar adhesive pads mimicking gecko feet are optimized for strong reversible adhesion, monolithic microsphere arrays mimicking the slippery {{zone of the}} pitchers of carnivorous plants of the genus Nepenthes show anti-adhesive properties even against <b>tacky</b> counterpart <b>surfaces.</b> In contrast {{to the influence of}} topography, the influence of relative humidity (RH) on adhesion has been widely neglected. Some previous works deal with the influence of RH on the adhesive performance of fibrillar adhesive pads. Commonly, humidity-induced softening of the fibrils enhances adhesion. However, little is known on the influence of RH on solid anti-adhesive surfaces. We prepared polymeric nanoporous monolithic microsphere arrays (NMMAs) with microsphere diameters of a few 10 µm to test their anti-adhesive properties at RHs of 2 % and 90 %. Despite the presence of continuous nanopore systems through which the inner nanopore walls were accessible to humid air, the topography-induced anti-adhesive properties of NMMAs on <b>tacky</b> counterpart <b>surfaces</b> were retained even at RH = 90 %. This RH-independent robustness of the anti-adhesive properties of NMMAs significantly contrasts the adhesion enhancement by humidity-induced softening on nanoporous fibrillar adhesive pads made of the same material...|$|R
50|$|Silicone Plugs: These plugs {{are soft}} and malleable, {{allowing}} a relatively large plug to be inserted into the fistula. Once folded and inserted into the ear, they expand, stretching the earlobe. However, stretching with silicone is often a dangerous decision. It's not recommended to use silicone plugs to stretch, due to the <b>tacky,</b> porous <b>surface.</b> The stretched fistula can adhere to the silicone if the lubricant used is pushed out by {{the pressure of the}} stretch, and an airtight seal can be created, trapping infection and causing it to spread internally. Also because silicone expands and contracts in temperature change, they can swell and potentially blow out a newly stretched fistula.|$|R
5000|$|... 2013- The 7th Annual Firecracker 100 {{was swept}} by the [...] "Rocketman" [...] Josh Richards, {{becoming}} the first driver to sweep all three features including both preliminary 30 lap features and the Firecracker 100 Finale. Heavy rains plagued the entire weekend, which created a very wet and <b>tacky</b> <b>surface</b> for the 100 lapper with a large,rough cushion. This was unlike any prior Firecracker 100, which typically features a slicker, slower track. This caused many cars to experience motor troubles and blown tires, creating 11 cautions and 2 red flags which led to only 10 cars running at the finish among the 28 car starting field. Richards passed two time Firecracker 100 Champion Scott Bloomquist and never relinquished the lead again. Several challengers to Richards experienced troubles throughout the race: 2010 Champion Shane Clanton hit the cushion and blew a tire on lap 49 while closing for the lead, John Blankenship also hit the cushion and broke his nose piece while closing for the lead on lap 51, Bloomquist blew a motor on lap 69 while running 2nd, Rick Eckert broke a rear end while battling for {{the lead in the}} closing laps. Tim McCreadie settled for second, while Darrell Langian came up short once again finishing 3rd. Gregg Satterlee rallied to finish 4th after pitting for tires, becoming just the second Pennsylvania driver to score a top 5 finish in the Firecracker.

40|$|Methacrylate-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) macromonomers {{have been}} {{obtained}} through a flexible synthetic method which has been tailored into an efficient 1 pot, 2 stage reaction. Linear and star-shaped analogues have been synthesised and 3 molecular weights of each architecture were produced for use in subsequent curing investigations. The PDMS macromonomers were photo cured into films by exposure to UV irra- diation {{in the presence of}} a free-radical initiator. A curing time study was carried out and the rheological properties, swelling ratio, Young's modulus, surface tack and macroscopic extension of the cured films were investigated. At short irradiation times, samples were sensitive to irradiation time and an increase in exposure produced a signif- icantly more solid-like film. However, after longer irradiation times, the film properties reached a plateau and films did not become significantly more solid-like despite further irradiation. Ideal network models are proposed which support the observation that the cured film properties were strongly affected by the macromonomer molecular weight. Low molecular weight macromonomers produced densely cross-linked films which were hard, elastomeric solids. Films formed from medium molecular weight macromonomers were softer materials with <b>tacky</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and films formed from the highest molecular weight were softer still and some samples exhibited viscous flow. Introducing branching into the macromonomers decreased the irradiation time re- quired to form a cohesive film. Increasing the degree of macromonomer branching increased the solid-like nature of the film in comparison to those formed from linear species, although this did not outweigh the effect of macromonomer molecular weight. The materials investigated in this study may have potential for use as non-degradable, curable materials in medical applications and have scope for in vivo curing.

40|$|The {{advent of}} Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) systems have aided the rapid {{manufacturing}} of composite aerospace structures. One {{of the challenges}} that AFP systems present is the uniformity of the deposited prepreg tape layers, which are prone to laps, gaps, overlaps and twists. The current detection modus operandi involves halting fabrication and performing a time consuming visual inspection of each tape layer. Typical AFP systems use a quartz lamp to heat the base layer to make the <b>surface</b> <b>tacky</b> as it deposits another tape layer. The idea was proposed to use the preheated base layer as a through transmission heat source and to inspect the newly added tape layer using a thermographic camera. As a preliminary study of this concept a laboratory proof of concept device was designed and constructed to simulate the through transmission heat source. Using the proof of concept device, we inspected an AFP-built uncured composite specimen with artificial manufacturing defects. This paper will discuss {{the results of this}} preliminary study and the implications involved with deploying a full-scale AFP inspection system...|$|R
