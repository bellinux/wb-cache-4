5|$|Portsmouth hosted {{first-class}} cricket at the United Services Recreation Ground from 1882, while from 1895 to 2000 Hampshire County Cricket Club matches {{were played}} there. This arrangement {{came to an}} end in 2000 when Hampshire moved all their home matches to their newly built Rose Bowl cricket ground in West End. The city is also home to four hockey clubs: City of Portsmouth Hockey Club, who are based at the University's Langstone Campus; Portsmouth & Southsea Hockey Club, and Portsmouth Sharks Hockey Club, who are both based at the Admiral Lord Nelson School; and United Services Portsmouth Hockey Club, who are based on Burnaby Road. Great Salterns Golf Club, established in 1926, is an 18-hole parkland course with <b>two</b> <b>holes</b> playing across Saltern lake. There are also coastal courses at Hayling, near the entrance to Langstone Harbour in the east and at the Gosport and Stokes Bay Golf Club to the west of Portsmouth Harbour entrance in Gosport.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before midnight, Taylor was {{led into}} the {{execution}} chamber and strapped to a chair 17 {{feet away from the}} shooters with a hood covering his head. Multiple bright lights covered Taylor. Sandbags were arranged behind him to prevent any ricochets. The captain walked down the aisle, tapping each shooter on the shoulder to check to see if they were ready. At 12:03 a.m. Mountain Standard Time on January 26, 1996, every shooter fired at the count of five and the white cloth target on Taylor's chest flew off. His chest moved upward and his left hand tightened into a fist. His grip gradually loosened and his head fell back. A doctor checked Taylor's neck for a pulse and cut <b>two</b> <b>holes</b> in his hood to check for a pupillary light reflex. Taylor was declared dead at 12:07 a.m. and became the 49th person to be executed in the state of Utah since 1852.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{begins in}} 1566, {{and five years}} later the bridge is completed, {{together}} with a caravanserai (or han). The bridge replaces the unreliable ferry transport that was once {{the only means of}} traversing the river and comes to represent an important link between the Bosnia Eyalet {{and the rest of the}} Ottoman Empire. The bridge is built by serfs, who intermittently stage strikes and sabotage the construction site in protest against the poor working conditions. The Ottomans respond harshly, impaling the one caught saboteur. The bridge is wider across the middle portion, known as the gate (or kapija), and this section becomes a popular meeting place. Every important moment in the lives of the local residents comes to revolve around the bridge, with Christian children crossing it to be baptized on the opposite bank, and children of all religions playing around it. As time progresses, legends develop around the history of the bridge. The locals tell of two Christian infants who were buried alive inside the bridge to placate the fairies (vile) that thwart its construction. They come to regard <b>two</b> <b>holes</b> on the side of the bridge as places where the infants' mothers would come to suckle them while they were entombed. About a century later, the Habsburg Monarchy reclaims much of Central Europe and the northern Balkans from the Ottomans, triggering a crisis within the empire. Due to lack of state funds, the caravanserai is abandoned and falls into disuse. The bridge, on the other hand, stands for centuries without maintenance because of how well it was constructed. The residents of Višegrad—Turks, Serbs, Sephardic Jews, and Roma—stand in solidarity with one another during the Drina's regular floods.|$|E

25|$|Much {{strategy}} in cribbage {{derives from the}} fact that the first hand counted is the non-dealer's. The dealer may be only <b>two</b> <b>holes</b> from winning and the opponent twenty, but if the pone holds a 3-3-4-5 hand and has cut a 5, the dealer who pegs only a Go will lose. Players use this knowledge to decide when to throw their hands (or play their cards) aggressively or defensively.|$|E

40|$|A Normal All Pseudo-Anosov Subgroup for the Genus Two Surface by Kim H Whittlesey Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics University of California at Berkeley Professor John Stallings, Chair We {{construct}} a normal, all pseudo-Anosov sub{{group of the}} mapping class group of the <b>two</b> <b>holed</b> torus. This is the rst known such subgroup, and answers a question asked by R. C. Penner, D. D. Long, and J. D. McCarthy in 1985. Using a branched covering of the <b>two</b> <b>holed</b> torus over the sphere and results of Birman and Hilden, we show that if a projection of a reducible mapping class of the <b>two</b> <b>holed</b> torus does not permute the six branch points, {{then it will be}} reducible on the sphere as well. The construction introduces " mapping classes of the sphere, which are analogous to Brunnian links.

40|$|Using {{functional}} renormalization group (FRG) approach, we {{analyze the}} η pairing in a five d-orbital model for iron-pncitides. We {{find that the}} η pairing between <b>two</b> <b>hole</b> pockets is a leading instability at low energy when the <b>two</b> <b>hole</b> pockets are close to a nesting condition. The result suggests that the system can spontaneously enter into a superconducting state with both normal pairing and η paring and the η pairing {{is driven by the}} inter-orbital antiferromagnetic exchange coupling while the normal pairing is driven by the intra-orbital antiferromagnetic ones. An effective model at low energy is proposed to account for the η pairing instability. Comment: 5 page...|$|R

25|$|Although several {{witnesses}} came to {{the conclusion}} that the attacks could not be the work of dogs or coyotes because they had not eaten the victim, this conclusion is incorrect. Both dogs and coyotes can kill and not consume the prey, either because they are inexperienced, or due to injury or difficulty in killing the prey. The prey can survive the attack and die afterwards from internal bleeding or circulatory shock. The presence of <b>two</b> <b>holes</b> in the neck, corresponding with the canine teeth, are to be expected since this is the only way that most land carnivores have to catch their prey.|$|E

Then two of the board cards at opposite sides of the circle (call them 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock) are dealt, followed by a second betting round. Two more opposite community cards are dealt (2 o'clock and 8 o'clock), followed by a third betting round. Finally, the 4 o'clock and 10 o'clock cards are dealt followed by a fourth and final betting round, and showdown.|$|R
40|$|We study one and <b>two</b> <b>hole</b> {{properties}} of the t-J model at half-filling on the square lattice using series expansion methods at T= 0. The dispersion curve for one hole excitations is calculated and found to be qualitatively similar to that obtained by other methods, but the bandwidth for small $t/J$ is some 20 % larger than given previously. We also obtain the binding energy and dispersion relation for <b>two</b> <b>hole</b> bound states. The lowest bound state as $t/J$ increases {{is found to be}} first d-wave, and then p-wave, in accordance with predictions based upon the Kohn-Luttinger effect.

40|$|The {{research}} work {{presented in this}} paper is based on the correlation between <b>two</b> <b>hole</b> insertion criteria in a boundary element method (BEM) and level set method (LSM) based structural topology optimisation scheme for 2 D elastic problems. The hole insertion criteria used in this work are based on the von Mises stress and the topological derivative approaches. During the optimisation process holes are automatically inserted in the design domain using each of the two criteria. The LSM is used to provide an implicit description of the structural geometry, and is also capable of automatically handling topological changes, i. e. holes merging with each other or with the boundary. The evolving structural geometry (i. e. the zero level set contours) is represented by NURBS, providing a smooth geometry throughout the optimisation process and completely eliminate jagged edges. In addition the optimal NURBS geometry can be used directly in other design processes. Four different benchmark examples are considered in this study and each is tested against the <b>two</b> <b>hole</b> insertion criteria. The results obtained validate the proposed optimisation method and we demonstrate a clear correlation between the <b>two</b> <b>hole</b> insertion criteria...|$|R
25|$|The abelisaurids all possess distinct, vestigial, and {{immobile}} forelimbs, {{with highly}} reduced manual phalanges. Carnotaurus and Majungasaurus {{are closely related}} but distinguish by several skeletal features. Carnotaurus has eleven dorsal vertebrae but Majungasaurus has thirteen. Carnotaurus has short dentary bones and an almost vertical ramus, while that of Majungasaurus curved backward and had notable caudal projections. Majungasaurines also have low, wide antorbital fenestrae, a wide triangular plate posterior to the parietal, <b>two</b> <b>holes</b> for a cerebral vein by the sagittal crest, and a wide groove on the occipital condyle. These differences are important because derived abelisaurids are classed as either majungasaurines or carnotaurines based on their synapomorphies.|$|E
25|$|It's been {{suggested}} that during his career Faldo wore down the opposition and benefited from other players making mistakes in pressure-filled situations. His three Masters titles at Augusta came after mistakes by Scott Hoch missing a short putt in 1989, Raymond Floyd hitting an approach shot into a pond in 1990 and from a collapse by Greg Norman {{in the final round}} in 1996. Two of Faldo's Open Championship wins came after mistakes in the closing <b>two</b> <b>holes</b> by Paul Azinger in 1987 and John Cook in 1992. Nevertheless, Faldo earns credit for the way in which he performed under pressure in his major victories.|$|E
