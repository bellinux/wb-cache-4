5|$|The Kenyan athletes {{emerged with}} both the {{individual}} and team titles in the men's and women's races. Despite limited experience in top level half marathon races, Wilson Kiprop and Florence Kiplagat won their respective races. Kiprop broke Zersenay Tadese's winning streak which dated back to 2006, out-sprinting the defending champion in the final stages. Sammy Kitwara won the men's bronze medal and helped Kenya to the men's team title. Led by Zersenay, <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> men beat Ethiopia to the team silver medal spot.|$|E
5|$|Though only {{numbering}} about 3,000 {{soldiers and}} 2,000 porters, the Belgo-Congolese force had to manage 15,000 prisoners {{in the former}} Galla-Sidamo Governorate after the campaign. At Gazzera's request, Gilliaert guaranteed <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> askari safe passage to British prisoner of war camps {{in the east and}} sent Congolese guards to protect them from Ethiopian retaliation. The Belgian force quickly returned to Congo with their spoils of war. The siege was the first major victory for the Free Belgian Forces and greatly improved their morale.|$|E

Departing there on 24 September, the Huntington sailed up the Red Sea, calling at Massaua on <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> coast on 26 September and Suez on 1 October. Departing Suez on 12 October, she retraced her track around Africa, calling at Port Sudan on 18 October, Durban on 2 November, Cape Town on 7 November.

50|$|Badoglio {{moved up}} <b>the</b> 1st <b>Eritrean</b> Division to join <b>the</b> 2nd <b>Eritrean</b> Division at Abaro Pass. Badoglio then ordered the {{commander}} of <b>the</b> 2nd <b>Eritrean</b> Division, General Achille Vaccarisi, to advance on the Warieu Pass and relieve the besieged Italians there.|$|R
2500|$|The Ethiopians {{switched}} {{the focus of}} their attack and fifteen thousand men under Ras Kassa advanced against <b>the</b> <b>Eritreans</b> holding Mekan Pass on the Italian left flank. [...] Haile Selassie hoped to face less resistance from <b>the</b> <b>Eritreans.</b> [...] From 0700 to 0800 hours, the Ethiopians kept up a steady onslaught and, despite taking heavy casualties, were beginning to make gains. But at 0800 Badoglio unleashed the bombers of the Italian Royal Air Force (Regia Aeronautica) and the Ethiopians could hear the ominous engine roar as they closed in with poison gas.|$|R
25|$|Haile Selassie now {{played his}} trump card. The Imperial Guard, {{under the command}} of Ras Getachew Abate, was sent in against <b>the</b> <b>Eritreans.</b> <b>The</b> {{training}} and discipline of this elite force was apparent in the methodical mode of their advance over the open ground. For three hours they struggled to roll up the Italian flank. The X Battalion of <b>the</b> 2nd <b>Eritrean</b> Division was virtually annihilated. In the end, the Italian commander of the unit called down concentrated artillery fire onto his own overrun positions and saved the day.|$|R
5|$|He opened 2005 with {{a second}} win in the European Clubs' Cross Country Cup. He won his first World Cross Country Championship medal soon after, {{finishing}} second to Bekele to take silver at the 2005 edition. On the track, he recorded a 5000m personal best of at the Qatar Grand Prix in Doha, and qualified to compete at the World Championships in both the 5000 and 10,000m. At the 2005 World Championships, he broke the national record in the 10,000 m final, but his time of 27:12.82 was only enough for sixth. The 5000 m final held little reprieve for <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> as he finished in second last position. He ended the season on a positive note, however, improving his 10,000m best to 27:04.70 at the Memorial Van Damme, and winning the Great North Run with a world best time of 59:05 – which was only his second outing over the half marathon distance.|$|E
5|$|Zersenay {{failed to}} make the podium for a second time at the 2006 World Cross Country Championships, but his fourth-place finish headed <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> team towards silver medal in the team competition. The {{following}} month, Zersenay overcame both Fabiano Joseph and Boniface Kiprop to win the Great Manchester Run. He sprinted to the line with a finishing time of 27:36; an Eritrean record and the second fastest that year. In August that year, he significantly improved his 10,000m best at Memorial Van Damme; his time of 26:37.25 knocked almost thirty seconds off his previous mark, but he still finished behind the emerging Micah Kogo who ran the tenth fastest ever time. A new best of 59:16 by Zersenay at the Rotterdam Half Marathon equalled Samuel Wanjiru's course record and boded well for the upcoming championship race.|$|E
5|$|In 1977 the Ethio-Somali War {{broke out}} over the disputed Ogaden region as Somalia invaded Ethiopia; {{although}} a former ally of Somali President Siad Barre, Castro had warned him against such action, and Cuba sided with Mengistu Haile Mariam's Marxist government of Ethiopia. He sent troops {{under the command of}} General Arnaldo Ochoa to aid the overwhelmed Ethiopian army. After forcing back the Somalis, Mengistu then ordered the Ethiopians to suppress <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> People's Liberation Front, a measure Castro refused to support. Castro extended support to Latin American revolutionary movements, namely the Sandinista National Liberation Front in its overthrow of the Nicaraguan rightist government of Anastasio Somoza Debayle in July 1979. Castro's critics accused the government of wasting Cuban lives in these military endeavors; the anti-Castro Center for a Free Cuba has claimed that an estimated 14,000 Cubans were killed in foreign Cuban military actions. When U.S. state critics claimed that Castro had no right to interfere in these nations, he countered that Cuba had been invited into them, pointing out the U.S.' own involvement in various foreign nations.|$|E

2500|$|At the November 2007 deadline, {{some analysts}} feared the restart {{of the border}} war but the date passed without any conflict. There were many reasons why war did not resume. Former U.S. Ambassador David Shinn said both Ethiopia and Eritrea were in a bad position. Many fear <b>the</b> weak <b>Eritrean</b> economy is not {{improving}} like those of other African nations while others say Ethiopia is bogged down in Mogadishu. David Shinn said Ethiopia has [...] "a very powerful and so far disciplined national army that made pretty short work of <b>the</b> <b>Eritreans</b> in 2000 and <b>the</b> <b>Eritreans</b> have not forgotten that." [...] But he stated Ethiopia {{is not interested in}} war because America would condemn Ethiopia if it initiated the war saying [...] "I don't think even the US could sit by and condone an Ethiopian initiated attack on Eritrea." ...|$|R
50|$|Ethiopian {{government}} spokesman Bereket Simon denied that any armed incursion had taken place, {{and claimed that}} <b>the</b> <b>Eritreans</b> were {{trying to cover up}} an attack by Eritrean rebels in which 25 Eritrean government soldiers were killed.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Eritrean</b> Orthodox Tewahedo Church {{also has}} the rank of bishops for various {{communities}} in Eritrea and the diaspora.

25|$|Like {{the other}} Eastern Catholic Churches, <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> Catholic Church {{is in full}} communion with the Holy See. It holds to the Christological {{definition}} taught at the Council of Chalcedon and accepts the universal jurisdiction of the Pope. These points distinguish it from <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> Orthodox Tewahedo Church, which is an Oriental Orthodox church comprising most Christians in the country. Like <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> Orthodox Church, <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> Catholic Church follows the Ethiopic liturgical rite in the Ge'ez language, a Semitic language which fell out of common use several centuries ago. This rite {{is based on the}} Coptic liturgy.|$|E
25|$|Religion in Eritrea mainly {{consists}} of Abrahamic faiths.

25|$|Menelik's {{disagreement}} with Article 17 {{of the treaty}} led to the Battle of Adwa. Before Italy could launch <b>the</b> invasion, <b>Eritreans</b> rebelled {{in an attempt to}} push Italy out of Eritrea and prevent its invasion of Ethiopia. The rebellion was not successful. However, some of <b>the</b> <b>Eritreans</b> managed to {{make their way to the}} Ethiopian camp and jointly fought Italy at the battle of Adwa. On March 1, 1896 the two armies met at Adwa. The Ethiopians came out victorious.|$|R
25|$|In 1958, a {{group of}} Eritreans founded <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> Liberation Movement (ELM). The {{organization}} mainly consisted of Eritrean students, professionals and intellectuals. It engaged in clandestine political activities intended to cultivate resistance to the centralizing policies of the imperial Ethiopian state. On 1 September 1961, <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> Liberation Front (ELF), {{under the leadership of}} Hamid Idris Awate, waged an armed struggle for independence. In 1962, Emperor Haile Selassie unilaterally dissolved <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> parliament and annexed the territory. The ensuing Eritrean War for Independence went on for 30 years against successive Ethiopian governments until 1991, when <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> People's Liberation Front (EPLF), a successor of the ELF, defeated the Ethiopian forces in Eritrea and helped a coalition of Ethiopian rebel forces take control of the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Eritrean</b> {{government}} previously withdrew its {{representative to}} the African Union to protest the AU's alleged lack of leadership in facilitating {{the implementation of a}} binding border decision demarcating the border between Eritrea and Ethiopia. <b>The</b> <b>Eritrean</b> government has since January 2011 appointed an envoy, Tesfa-Alem Tekle, to the AU.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> {{independence}} {{struggle was}} led by <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> Liberation Front (ELF). The independence struggle can properly be understood as the resistance to the annexation of Eritrea by Ethiopia long after the Italians left the territory. Additionally, one may consider {{the actions of the}} Ethiopian Monarchy against Muslims in <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> government as a contributing factor to the revolution. At first, this group factionalized the liberation movement along ethnic and geographic lines. The initial four zonal commands of the ELF were all lowland areas and primarily Muslim. Few Christians joined the organization in the beginning, fearing Muslim domination.|$|E

25|$|In August 2005, Abune Antonios, the Patriarch of <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> Orthodox Tewahedo Church, was {{confined}} to a strictly ceremonial role. In a letter dated 13 January 2006, Patriarch Abune Antonios was informed that following several sessions of the church's Holy Synod, he had been formally deposed. In a written response that was widely published, the Patriarch rejected the grounds of his dismissal, questioned {{the legitimacy of the}} synod, and excommunicated two signatories to the 13 January 2006 letter, including Yoftahe Dimetros, whom the Patriarch identified as being responsible for the church's recent upheavals. Patriarch Antonios also appealed his case to the Council of the Monasteries of <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> Orthodox Church and to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. Abune Antonios was deposed by <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> Holy Synod supposedly under pressure from <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> government; as of 2006 he is under house arrest. Abuna Antonios was replaced by Abune Dioskoros as the 4th Patriarch of the church. Many believe that Abune Antonios was wrongly deposed and still consider him Patriarch. Many Eritrean Orthodox followers disagree with <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> government making decisions in religious matters. The ruling Patriarch Abuna Dioskoros died on 21 December 2015.

In April 1993, in a referendum supported by Ethiopia, <b>the</b> <b>Eritrean</b> people voted almost unanimously in favour of independence. Formal international recognition of an independent, sovereign Eritrea followed later the same year.
