40|$|Global {{populations in}} {{towns and cities}} are {{continuing}} to rise resulting in the urbanisation of greenfield sites. Urbanisation converts permeable rural land into land for urban and industrial areas and increases the area of impermeable surfaces such as roofs, roads, driveways and pavements. An increase in impervious surfaces can impose dramatic changes to a catchment by altering the natural drainage characteristics. Impervious surfaces effectively seals off much of the underlying soil and prevents the infiltration of water, oxygen and nutrients to the soil below. Street trees {{are an integral part}} of everyday life. The role of street trees has adapted from one of ornamentation to service provision. Street trees provide a vast range of benefits in residential and community areas and support healthy communities by providing environmental, social and economic benefits. However, street trees often suffer in urban environments as a result of increased impervious surface areas and lack of available growing space. The installation and survival of urban trees is often challenging and urban designers must consider critical issues in their landscape design including space availability, ground conditions and maintenance requirements. The water, oxygen and nutrients essential for tree growth are often in short supply in urban soils due to the impervious surfaces, such as conventional asphalt, impervious blocks or concrete paving sealing off the soil surface. These undesirable site conditions for <b>tree</b> <b>growth</b> <b>often</b> lead to shorter life spans of urban trees compared to those in natural environments.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{temporal}} dynamics of the carbon sequestering capacity and dynamics of African tropical humid forest ecosystems in response to various environmental drivers. This lack of knowledge is mainly due to the absence of ecosystem scale flux measurements of gas exchange. However, <b>tree</b> <b>growth</b> <b>often</b> displays itself as alternating pattern of visible rings due to the seasonally varying growth speed of the vascular cambium. Consequently, analysis of tree growth through tree-ring analysis provides us with insights into past responses of the carbon sequestering capacity of key species to abrupt ecosystem disturbances and, while slower, a changing climate. Not only does the width and density of growth rings reflect annual growth but their isotopic composition of 13 C/ 12 C and 18 O/ 16 O isotopes also reveal the environmental conditions in which the trees were growing. In particular, stable isotope ratios in tree-rings of carbon are influenced by fractionation through carboxylation during photosynthesis and changes in leaf stomatal conductance. Similarly, fractionation of oxygen isotopes of soil water occurs at the leaf level through evapo-transipiration. As a consequence, 18 O/ 16 O (δ 18 O) values in wood cores will reflect both the signal of the source water {{as well as that of}} for example summer humidity. Therefore, both C and O stable isotopes might not only be valuable as proxy data for past climatic conditions but they also serve as an important tool in understanding carbon and water relations within a tropical forest ecosystems. To this end we correlate long term climate records (1961 – present) with tree ring measurement of incremental growth and high resolution analysis of tree-core stable isotope composition(δ 13 C, δ 18 O) at a tropical humid forests in the DR Congo. The Yangambi Man And Biosphere (MAB) reserve is located in the north-eastern part of DR Congo, with a distinct tropical rainforest climate. In addition to the tree-core data records and extensive meteorological records collected at both sites, observations on green leaf phenology of key species will provide us with additional information on potential carbon sequestration dynamics. Because, phenology is a first order control on plant productivity. In this unique study, using detailed tree-ring analyses together with auxiliary data, we explore the temporal dynamics of carbon and water relations and the influence on carbon sequestration of key tree species in African tropical humid forests.

40|$|Northern {{mid-latitude}} {{forests are}} a large terrestrial carbon sink(1 - 4). Ignoring nutrient limitations, large increases in carbon sequestration from carbon dioxide (CO 2) fertilization are expected in these forests(5). Yet, forests are usually relegated to sites of moderate to poor fertility, where <b>tree</b> <b>growth</b> is <b>often</b> limited by nutrient supply, in particular nitrogen(6, 7). Here we present evidence that estimates of increases in carbon sequestration of forests, {{which is expected to}} partially compensate for increasing CO 2 in the atmosphere, are unduly optimistic(8). In two forest experiments on maturing pines exposed to elevated atmospheric CO 2, the CO 2 -induced biomass carbon increment without added nutrients was undetectable at a nutritionally poor site, and the stimulation at a nutritionally moderate site was transient, stabilizing at a marginal gain after three years. However, a large synergistic gain from higher CO 2 and nutrients was detected with nutrients added. This gain was even larger at the poor site (threefold higher than the expected additive effect) than at the moderate site (twofold higher). Thus, fertility can restrain the response of wood carbon sequestration to increased atmospheric CO 2. Assessment of future carbon sequestration should consider the limitations imposed by soil fertility, as well as interactions with nitrogen deposition...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLandslides {{or other}} forms of mass {{movement}} influence slope stability, and are known to have significant effects on vegetation patterns. Observation of such surface patterns may result in valuable information for understanding the kinematics of the landslide. In forested regions, <b>tree</b> <b>growth</b> anomaly is <b>often</b> served as an indicator of shallow landslide activity. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is able to acquire accurate and dense 3 D point cloud which provides the potential of reconstructing forest structure. In this study, we obtained high density TLS data in the northern Walgau in the federal state of Vorarlberg in Austria, where translational mass movement phenomenon exists in a forested region. A novel algorithm was developed to fast and robustly characterize single tree parameters (e. g. diameter at breast height (DBH), inclination angle of the stem and stem volume). Consequently, these tree parameters were successfully determined at single tree level. Field measurements were conducted in order to validate the results from the modelling algorithm. The root mean square error of DBH is 1. 6 cm (4. 9 %). The average stem inclination angle is 8. 2 °. The results of this study revealed that characterization of trees (i. e. inclination of the stems) can be used to indicate shallow landslide activities in forested regions.

Different <b>tree</b> <b>growth</b> patterns as well as a slower <b>tree</b> <b>growth</b> with increase in filler loading in LDPE nanocomposites were observed. The observed slow propagation of <b>tree</b> <b>growth</b> with filler loading is attributed to the changes in the polymer crystalline morphology induced by the presence of nano-particles and the greater ability of the nanoparticles to resist discharge growth. SEM studies carried out to determine the morphology of unfilled and nano-filled LDPE showed an increase in lamellae packing in LDPE nanocomposites and this increased lamellar density leads to a reduction in the tree propagation rate. Partial discharge activities were also monitored during the electrical <b>tree</b> <b>growth</b> in both the unfilled and the nano-filled LDPE samples and were found to be significantly different. PD magnitude and the number of PD pulses per cycle were found to be lower with electrical <b>tree</b> <b>growth</b> duration in LDPE nanocomposites as compared to unfilled LDPE. The same trend was seen with increased filler loading also...|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} called Arbitrary Waveform Impedance Spectroscopy (AWIS) developed for measuring dielectric properties in insulating materials {{has been used}} to study capacitance and dielectric loss changes during electrical <b>tree</b> <b>growth</b> in LDPE samples. The sample capacitance is small, in the range of 0. 1 – 0. 15 pF, placing high demands on the measurement system. Simulations in FEM-software show that the measured capacitance is in agreement with simulated values and can be used to estimate <b>tree</b> <b>growth</b> rate. It also seems to be possible to differentiate between different regions of <b>tree</b> <b>growth</b> by analyzing changes in capacitance and loss of the studied samples...|$|R
