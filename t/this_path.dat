5|$|Tactically, {{the pass}} at Thermopylae was {{ideally suited to}} the Greek style of warfare. A hoplite phalanx could block the narrow pass with ease, with no risk of being outflanked by cavalry. Moreover, in the pass, the phalanx {{would have been very}} {{difficult}} to assault for the more lightly armed Persian infantry. The major weak point for the Greeks was the mountain track which led across the highland parallel to Thermopylae, that could allow their position to be outflanked. Although probably unsuitable for cavalry, <b>this</b> <b>path</b> could easily be traversed by the Persian infantry (many of whom were versed in mountain warfare). Leonidas was made aware of <b>this</b> <b>path</b> by local people from Trachis, and he positioned a detachment of Phocian troops there in order to block this route.|$|E

5|$|In larval lampreys, {{the thyroid}} {{originates}} as an exocrine gland, secreting its hormones into the gut, and {{associated with the}} larva's filter-feeding apparatus. In the adult lamprey, the gland separates from the gut, and becomes endocrine, but <b>this</b> <b>path</b> of development may reflect the evolutionary origin of the thyroid. For instance, the closest living relatives of vertebrates, the tunicates and Amphioxus, have a structure {{very similar to that}} of larval lampreys (the endostyle), and this also secretes iodine-containing compounds (albeit not thyroxine).|$|E

5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's {{interest}} in pantheism was whetted by the folkloristic studies of Alexander Afanasyev. That author's standard work, The Poetic Outlook on Nature by the Slavs, became Rimsky-Korsakov's pantheistic bible. The composer first applied Afanasyev's ideas in May Night, {{in which he}} helped fill out Gogol's story by using folk dances and calendar songs. He went further down <b>this</b> <b>path</b> in The Snow Maiden, where he made extensive use of seasonal calendar songs and khorovodi (ceremonial dances) in the folk tradition.|$|E

5|$|According to Jainism, {{the purpose}} of nonviolence is {{not because it is}} a commandment of a God or any other supreme being. Its purpose is also not simply because its {{observance}} is conducive to general welfare of the state or the community. While it is true that in Jainism, the moral and religious injunctions were laid down as law by Arhats who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts, their adherence is just not to please a God, but the life of the Arhats has demonstrated that such commandments were conductive to Arhat's own welfare, helping him to reach spiritual victory. Just as Arhats achieved spiritual victory by observing non-violence, so can anyone who follows <b>this</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, Psittacosaurus may {{not have}} been entirely bipedal for its entire lifespan. Taking {{sections}} from the limb bones of 16 specimens of Psittacosaurus, ranging in age from less than a year old to ten-year old adults, Qi Zhao from the University of Bristol found that Psittacosaurus was probably secondarily bipedal. The infants' front limbs grew at faster rates than the hind limbs at between birth and three years of age. At the age of between four and six years, arm growth slowed and leg growth accelerated as the animal became mature. At this stage, Psittacosaurs would switch to a bipedal stance. These findings further reveal that the ancestor of Psittacosaurus was likely quadrupedal and eventually gained the ability to become bipedal as it evolved, with the young retaining the quadrupedal gait of the ancestor in question. These findings also lead to the hypothesis that many such dinosaur families may have evolved along <b>this</b> <b>path</b> {{at some point in their}} evolution.|$|E

5|$|Potocki was an alumnus of the Collegium Nobilium in Warsaw, {{where he}} was a student in the years 1761–1765. From 1765 he studied {{theology}} and law in Rome, where he attended the Collegium Nazarenum, up to about 1769. His parents intended for him to join the ranks of clergy, but he refused to follow <b>this</b> <b>path.</b> After traveling through Italy and Germany, he returned to Poland around 1771. On 27 December 1772 he married Elżbieta Lubomirska. This marriage brought him close to the political faction of Familia. Early on, Potocki made a major impression on many of his contemporaries, being groomed as the next leader of Familia. From 1772 he was invited to the King Stanisław II Augustus' Thursday Dinners.|$|E
5|$|That conquest was a {{consequence}} of the Augustan imperative of securing the Imperial borders. To effectively control the Alps as the shield of northern Italy, Rome needed to control both flanks of the mountain range. Thus it had to extend its power to the Rhine and Danube, thereby also opening a direct route to Germania and all of Central Europe. The last obstacle in <b>this</b> <b>path</b> were the Raetians. After a first expedition against them by Publius Silius Nerva in 16BC, a more thorough campaign by Drusus and the later emperor Tiberius brought Raetia – and thereby all of Switzerland – firmly under Roman control.|$|E

In 1723, Welsh Tract settlers pushed for the road to be improved.

5|$|The {{choice of}} Law marked {{the start of}} a new chapter for Smuts. The {{preceding}} years at Stellenbosch had been ones of tremendous intellectual development. From the narrow focus of his upbringing, his outlook had now expanded, awakening within him a consciousness of the breadth of knowledge now open before him. Smuts, though remaining an adherent of the Church, and respectful of the Bible and its teachings, had developed a more questioning and critical outlook during the course of his studies. Whereas at the outset of his university career he was content to follow his parents' wishes and be ordained into the Church, as his time at Victoria College came to an end he found himself more and more unwilling to commit to <b>this</b> <b>path.</b> Though he had now as yet wholly rejected the idea of ordination, he wished for a period of more diversified study before making that decision. So it was that Smuts came to select Law, rather than Divinity or Philosophy - the logical choices for a future Minister of Religion.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} Civil War battle fought in Indiana {{was a small}} skirmish during Morgan's Raid. On the morning of July 9, 1863, Morgan attempted to cross the Ohio River into Indiana with his force of 2,400 Confederate cavalry. After his crossing was briefly contested, he marched north to Corydon where he fought the Indiana Legion in the short Battle of Corydon. Morgan took command of the heights south of Corydon and shot two shells from his batteries into the town, which promptly surrendered. The battle left 15 dead and 40 wounded. Morgan's main body of troopers briefly raided New Salisbury, Crandall, Palmyra, and Salem. Fear gripped the capitol, and the militia began to form there to contest Morgan's advance. After Salem, however, Morgan turned east, raiding and skirmishing along <b>this</b> <b>path</b> and leaving Indiana through West Harrison on July 13 into Ohio, where he was captured.|$|E
