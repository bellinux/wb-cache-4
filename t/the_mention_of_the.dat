5|$|According to the NPD Group, Brütal Legend sold {{approximately}} 215,000 {{copies in}} the United States in October 2009, with about 150,000 copies being for the Xbox 360 platform, {{making it the}} 12th-top-selling game in that month.

In an interview in February 2011, Schafer claimed that the game had sold over 1.4 million copies. According to data collected through Nielsen SoundScan, some songs contained within Brütal Legends soundtrack saw digital sales increases of up to 700% following the game's release, similar to the effects of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, though impact on overall sales of these songs was rather small.|$|E
5|$|Ecgbert {{wrote the}} Dialogus ecclesiasticae institutionis, {{which was a}} legal code for the clergy, setting forth the proper {{procedures}} for many clerical and ecclesiastical issues including weregild for clerics, entrance to clerical orders, deposition from the clergy, criminal monks, clerics in court, and other matters. It survives as one complete manuscript, with a few excerpts in other manuscripts. Because Ecgbert was the senior archbishop in England {{after the death of}} Nothhelm in 739, {{it is possible that the}} Dialogus was intended not just for the Northumbrian church but for the entire church in England. The Dialogus details a code of conduct for the clergy and how the clergy was to behave in society. The exact date it was composed is unclear, but it was probably after 735, based on <b>the</b> <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> archiepiscopal status of Ecgbert in one title as well as the internal evidence of the work. The historian Simon Coates saw the Dialogus as not especially exalting monks above the laity.|$|E

According to the legend preserved in the work, they were led by five brothers Κλουκας (Kloukas), Λόβελος (Lobelos), Κοσέντζης (Kosentzis), Μουχλώ (Mouchlo), Χρωβάτος (Chrobatos), and two sisters Τουγά (Touga) and Βουγά (Bouga), and their archon {{at the time was}} father of Porga, and they were baptized during the rule of Porga in the 7th century.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{eventual}} {{termination of the}} supply of manna, Exodus states that {{a small amount of}} it survived within an omer-sized pot or jar, which was kept facing the Testimony (possibly, adjacent to the Ark of the Covenant); it indicates that God instructed this of Moses, who delegated it to Aaron. The Epistle to the Hebrews states that the pot was stored inside the Ark. Classical rabbinical sources believe the pot was made of gold; some say it was only there for the generation following Moses, and others that it survived at least until the time of Jeremiah. However, the First Book of Kings states that it was absent earlier than Jeremiah, during Solomon's reign in the tenth century B.C. Form critics attribute <b>the</b> <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pot to the Priestly tradition, concluding that the pot existed in the early sixth century B.C.|$|E

By the nature of the revisions and <b>the</b> <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actor Thomas Goodale in 3.1 it is clear that it was written for the public stage. Since that time no recorded performance of Sir Thomas More took place until a three-night student production by the Birkbeck College, University of London, in December 1922. The play was staged with more than 40 students at the King's School, Canterbury, 4–6 November 1938, with P. D. V. Strallen in the title role. The first known professional staging of the play was 22–29 June 1954 at the London Theatre Centre for the Advance Players Association.

25|$|Sahih Muslim and Sahih Bukhari record various recensions of a hadith where Muhammad had prophesised {{that the}} Day of Judgment {{will not come}} until Muslims and Jews fight each other. The Muslims will kill the Jews with such success that they will then hide behind stones or both trees and stones {{according}} to various recensions, which will then cry out to a Muslim that a Jew is hiding behind them {{and ask them to}} kill him. The only one not to do so will be the Gharqad tree as it is the tree of the Jews. Different interpretations about the Gharqad tree mentioned in the Hadith exists. One of the interpretations is that the Gharqad tree is an actual tree. Israelis have been alleged to plant the tree around various locations for e.g., their settlements in West Bank and Gaza, around Israel Museum and the Knesset. Other claims about the tree are that it grows outside Herod's Gate or that it is actually a bush that grows outside Jaffa Gate which some Muslims believe where Jesus will return to Earth and slay the Dajjal, following the final battle between the Muslims and unbelievers which some believe will take place directly below the Jaffa Gate below the Sultan's Pool. Another interpretation that exists is that <b>the</b> <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gharqad tree is symbolic and is in reference to all the forces of the world believed to conspire with the Jews against Muslims.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between Uni and the Phoenician goddess Astarte {{has been brought}} to light by {{the discovery of the}} Pyrgi Tablets in 1964. At Pyrgi, one of the ports of Caere, excavations had since 1956 revealed the existence of a sacred area, intensely active from {{the last quarter of the}} 4th century, yielding two documents of a cult of Uni. Scholars had long believed Etruscan goddess Uni was strongly influenced by the Argive Heras and had her Punic counterpart in Carthaginian goddess Tanit, identified by the Romans as Juno Caelestis. Nonetheless Augustine of Hippo had already stated that Iuno was named Astarte in the Punic language, notion that the discovery of the Pyrgi lamellae has proved correct. It is debated whether such an identification was linked to a transient political stage corresponding with Tefarie Velianas's Carthaginian-backed tyranny on Caere as the sanctuary does not show any other trait proper to Phoenician ones. <b>The</b> <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goddess of the sanctuary as being named locally Eileitheia and Leucothea by different Greek authors narrating its destruction by the Syracusean fleet in 384 BC, made the picture even more complex. R. Bloch has proposed a two-stage interpretation: the first theonym Eilethya corresponds to Juno Lucina, the second Leucothea to Mater Matuta. However, the local theonym is Uni and one would legitimately expect it to be translated as Hera. A fragmentary bronze lamella discovered on the same site and mentioning both theonym Uni and Thesan (i. e. Latin Juno and Aurora-Mater Matuta) would then allow the inference of the integration of the two deities at Pyrgi: the local Uni-Thesan matronal and auroral, would have become the Iuno Lucina and the Mater Matuta of Rome. The Greek assimilation would reflect this process as not direct but subsequent to a process of distinction. Renard rejects this hypothesis since he sees in Uni and Thesan two distinct deities, though associated in cult. However the entire picture should have been familiar in Italian and Roman religious lore as is shown by the complexity and ambivalence of the relationship of Juno with the Rome and Romans in Virgil's Aeneid, who has Latin, Greek and Punic traits, result of a plurisaecular process of amalgamation. Also remarkable in this sense is the Fanum Iunonis of Malta (of the Hellenistic period) which has yielded dedicatory inscriptions to Astarte and Tanit.|$|E
