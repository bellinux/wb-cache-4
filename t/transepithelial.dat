25|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} may {{be diagnosed}} by many different methods, including newborn screening, sweat testing, and genetic testing. As of 2006 in the United States, 10% of cases are diagnosed shortly after birth {{as part of}} newborn screening programs. The newborn screen initially measures for raised blood concentration of immunoreactive trypsinogen. Infants with an abnormal newborn screen need a sweat test to confirm the CF diagnosis. In many cases, a parent makes the diagnosis because the infant tastes salty. Immunoreactive trypsinogen levels can be increased in individuals who have a single mutated copy of the CFTR gene (carriers) or, in rare instances, in individuals with two normal copies of the CFTR gene. Due to these false positives, CF screening in newborns can be controversial. Most U.S. states and countries do not screen for CF routinely at birth. Therefore, most individuals are diagnosed after symptoms (e.g. sinopulmonary disease and GI manifestations) prompt an evaluation for cystic fibrosis. The most commonly used form of testing is the sweat test. Sweat testing involves application of a medication that stimulates sweating (pilocarpine). To deliver the medication through the skin, iontophoresis is used, whereby one electrode is placed onto the applied medication and an electric current is passed to a separate electrode on the skin. The resultant sweat is then collected on filter paper or in a capillary tube and analyzed for abnormal amounts of sodium and chloride. People with CF have increased amounts {{of them in their}} sweat. In contrast, people with CF have less thiocyanate and hypothiocyanite in their saliva and mucus (Banfi et al.). In the case of milder forms of CF, <b>transepithelial</b> potential difference measurements can be helpful. CF can also be diagnosed by identification of mutations in the CFTR gene.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Transepithelial</b> {{photorefractive keratectomy}} (TransPRK) is a laser-assisted eye surgery to correct {{refraction}} errors of human eye cornea.

50|$|Experimentally, it was {{discovered}} that a lowering of fluid absorption from external environments is shown in the presence of serosal bumetamide. It was also discovered that there is a distinct relationship between the solute concentration deemed necessary to decrease <b>transepithelial</b> flow, and hydraulic permeability.|$|E
50|$|<b>Transepithelial</b> or transcellular permeability. This {{consists}} of specific transport of solutes across the epithelial cells.

50|$|<b>Transepithelial</b> or epithelium-on (epi-on) {{cross-linking}} is {{a technique}} which was first performed in 2004 in the U.S., the corneal epithelium layer is left intact. in this technique, because the epithelium is not removed, riboflavin loading requires more time than with epi-off techniques, and may be less effective.|$|E
5000|$|In these cases, {{a useful}} diagnostic, adjunct {{involves}} measuring the nasal <b>transepithelial</b> potential difference (ie, the charge on the respiratory epithelial surface {{as compared to}} interstitial fluid).

50|$|This {{regulatory}} protein (factor) interacts with a sodium/hydrogen exchanger NHE3 (SLC9A3) {{in the brush}} border membrane of the proximal tubule, small intestine, and colon that {{plays a major role}} in <b>transepithelial</b> sodium absorption.

50|$|The Chloride Intracellular Ion Channel (CLIC) Family (TC# 1.A.12) {{consists}} of six conserved proteins in humans (CLIC1, CLIC2, CLIC3, CLIC4, CLIC5, CLIC6). Members exist as both monomeric soluble proteins and integral membrane proteins where they function as chloride-selective ion channels. These proteins {{are thought to}} function in the regulation of the membrane potential and in <b>transepithelial</b> ion absorption and secretion in the kidney.|$|E
5000|$|The {{absorption}} of electrolytes and water {{is one of}} the most important functions of the digestive tract. Water absorption is passive and [...] - depending on the speed and direction of solute flow. Other factors influencing fluid absorption are osmolarity and the specific intestinal region. Regulated selective permability is performed through two major routes: the transcellular (<b>transepithelial)</b> route and the paracellular route.|$|E
50|$|In most exocrine glands, the CFTR protein {{normally}} secretes chloride ions {{into the}} lumen, {{and also has}} a tonic inhibitory effect on {{the opening of the}} apical sodium channel (which absorbs sodium into the cell). Impaired CFTR functioning directly reduces ductal epithelial chloride secretion and indirectly increases sodium absorption through lack of CFTR's inhibitory effect on the apical sodium channel. The result is dehydrated mucus and a widened, negative <b>transepithelial</b> potential difference.|$|E
5000|$|In humans, gene CLCN5 {{is located}} on {{chromosome}} Xp11.22, and has a 2238-bp coding sequence that consists of 11 exons that span 25 to 30 kb of genomic DNA and encode a 746-amino-acid protein. [...] CLCN5 belongs {{to the family of}} voltage-gated chloride channel genes (CLCN1-CLCN7, CLCKa and CLCKb) that have about 12 transmembrane domains. These chloride channels have {{an important role in the}} control of membrane excitability, <b>transepithelial</b> transport, and possibly cell volume.|$|E
50|$|A proinflammatory {{cytokine}} affects {{functions of}} transporters and ion channels from the nephron. As a result, {{there is a}} change in the activity of the potassium ion (K+) channels that changes the <b>transepithelial</b> transport of solutes and water in the kidney. The kidney proximal tubule cells produce proinflammatory cytokines in response to lipopolysaccaride. Proinflammatory cytokines affect the renal K+ channels. Interferon-gamma causes delayed suppression and acute stimulation of the 40 pS K+ channel. Also, TGF-beta activates the KCa3.1 K+ channel, which could be involved the detrimental effects of renal fibrosis.|$|E
50|$|Epithelial cell {{proliferation}} and fluid secretion {{that lead to}} cystogenesis are two hallmark features in ADPKD.

50|$|It is {{important}} to realise that a very small change in hydrostatic pressure can create a significant motivating force for the movement and transport of water through and across the membrane. Osmosis of substances happens to the kidneyâ€™s proximal tube, the small intestine, skin, and glands. Na+ pumps create a flux of sodium into the lis. This is reasonable considering {{that there is a}} large number of sodium pumps on the lateral membranes of transporting epithelia. Once the pumps are put to use, the lateral intercellular space (lis) will become hyperosmotic with respect to the external bath or environment. When equilibrium is reached at the <b>transepithelial</b> equilibrium, the water flow will be lumen into blood, according to Curran.|$|E
50|$|Curran {{says that}} the {{correction}} of water flow in skin {{can be attributed to}} altering reflection coefficients that exist at the opposing boundaries. This is what will couple water flow-in across the tight junction with active solute flow-in. In this system, this will mean that the rate of water influx is directly proportional to the amount of Na+ going into the system (E. Larson et al. 2007). If the sodium pump enters lis enough so that there is sufficient concentration, then water may move osmositcally across an adverse <b>transepithelial</b> osmotic gradient. Again, the Hertz convection-diffusion equation says much about the entering of water and solutes across a membrane. Na+ is transported through principle cells, and Cl- is transported through mitochondria-rich cells.|$|E
5000|$|Cystinuria is a {{cause of}} {{persistent}} kidney stones. It is a disease involving the defective <b>transepithelial</b> transport of cystine and dibasic amino acids in the kidney and intestine, {{and is one of}} many causes of kidney stones. If not treated properly, the disease could cause serious damage to the kidneys and surrounding organs, and in some rare cases death. The stones may be identified by a positive nitroprusside cyanide test. The crystals are usually hexagonal, translucent, white. Upon removal, the stones may be pink or yellow in color, but later they turn to greenish due to exposure to air. Cystinuria is usually asymptomatic when no stone is formed. However, once a stone is formed, or if stone production is severe or frequent, symptoms may be present: ...|$|E
5000|$|Schwind {{recently}} {{enhanced the}} Schwind AMARIS firmware {{to include a}} new feature called [...] "SmartSurfACE", a laser spot optimization algorithm, developed in conjunction with Dr. David T.C. Lin in Vancouver, Canada. SmartSurfACE provides for an exceptionally smooth stromal surface post-ablation which accelerates re-epithelialization and dramatically reduces discomfort. The results of this stromal smoothing optimization have been nothing short of spectacular with <b>transepithelial</b> PRK (transPRK) patients seeing better immediately after surgery than they would after 1 month with a previous treatment algorithm. In the words of Dr. Lin, Pacific Laser Eye Center, Vancouver, Canada, patients are routinely seeing better immediately after surgery than they did with their glasses prior to surgery. Third party studies are now confirming the previously published results of the company's consultants.|$|E
50|$|Ordered {{mesoporous}} silica (e.g. SBA-15, TUD-1, HMM-33, and FSM-16) also show potential {{to boost the}} in vitro and in vivo dissolution of poorly water-soluble drugs. Many drug-candidates coming from drug discovery suffer from a poor water solubility. An insufficient dissolution of these hydrophobic drugs in the gastrointestinal fluids strongly limits the oral bioavailability. One example is itraconazole which is an antimycoticum known for its poor aqueous solubility. Upon introduction of itraconazole-on-SBA-15 formulation in simulated gastrointestinal fluids, a supersaturated solution is obtained giving rise to enhanced <b>transepithelial</b> intestinal transport. Also the efficient uptake into the systemic circulation of SBA-15 formulated itraconazole has been demonstrated in vivo (rabbits and dogs). This approach based on SBA-15 yields stable formulations {{and can be used}} {{for a wide variety of}} poorly water-soluble compounds.|$|E
50|$|The <b>transepithelial</b> {{potential}} - or TEP - of a newt's cell is {{upheld by}} the intake of sodium in vivo. Brown et al. performed an experiment to observe the sodium permeability and saturation effect. What was discovered was that when the external concentration of sodium exceeds 10-20 mM within {{the presence of the}} Cl anion, the TEP decreases. A plateau is reached for the concentration of sodium inside the cell when the external concentration is {{greater than or equal to}} 10mM in the presence of the sulfate ion. These data suggest that the saturation of the sodium transport mechanism occurs at around 10mM. The slightly different results shown in the presence of differing anions has been interpreted as being reflective of integumental permeability, or leak conductance, of sodium at high temperatures.|$|E
5000|$|Fluid {{flow through}} the nephron must be kept within a narrow range for normal renal {{function}} in order to not compromise {{the ability of the}} nephron to maintain salt and water balance. [...] Tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) regulates tubular flow by detecting and correcting changes in GFR. Active <b>transepithelial</b> transport is used by the thick ascending limb (TAL) cells to pump NaCl to the surrounding interstitium from luminal fluid. The Tubular fluid is diluted because the cell's walls are water-impermeable and do not lose water as NaCl is actively reabsorbed. Thus, the TAL is an important segment of the TGF system, and its transport properties allow it to act as a key operator of the TGF system. A reduction of GFR occurs as a result of TGF when NaCl concentration at the sensor site is increased within the physiological range of approximately 10 to 60 mM.|$|E
50|$|Some {{of these}} {{stressors}} and stimulus {{that must be}} neutralized come from {{the environment of the}} Italian crested newt. T. carnifex lives in an open aquatic environment relatively close to human activity, which makes it prone to sewage leakages. It is noted that the absorption of the direct environment is a daily part of T. carnifexs life. This being said, it is clear that should there be toxins in the aquatic environment of the newt, it is highly likely and probably guaranteed that they will be absorbed into the body of T. carnifex. Chemicals such as nonlyphenol and ethoxylate, which are endocrine disruptors, are two of many found in the newts environments, and are considered the most toxic when transformed by microorganisms. This presents a very clear and present problem, because once these chemicals enter the skin, they become integrated into the newtâ€™s bodily functions and can cause great harm to the animal. Because T. carnifex osmoregulates mostly through <b>transepithelial</b> movement of water and solutes, this is probably the largest physiological challenge faced by the newt.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{performed}} to check if the well-known intestinal spasmolytic effect of mebeverine is paralleled by any changes in intestinal <b>transepithelial</b> currents. The <b>transepithelial</b> potential difference related to ionic currents of the isolated rabbit distal colon wall was measured by means of Ussingâ€™s technique under control conditions and after gentle mechanical stimulation of intestinal epithelial surface by a flux from peristaltic pump and with and without of mebeverine in stimulation fluid. The transient hyperpolarization after mechanical stimulation was diminished after addition of mebeverine to the stimulation fluid when chloride transport was inhibited by bumetanide (BUME) but {{in the presence of}} amiloride (AMI), a sodium ion transport inhibitor, the drug did not influence the reaction. It was inferred that mebeverine was able to modulate <b>transepithelial</b> sodium ion transport and in this way to modify interaction between colonic wall and its contents during intestinal passage.

40|$|When {{amphibian}} {{skin was}} incubated under {{conditions in which}} <b>transepithelial</b> sodium transport was abolished, a conductive <b>transepithelial</b> Cl- flux arose when Cl- was removed {{from one of the}} compartments.

Time to epithelial healing, ocular discomfort, uncorrected and best corrected visual acuities, manifest refraction, haze, greyscale value, and keratocyte apoptosis in confocal microscopy were recorded. Results. The mean time to epithelial healing was significantly longer after LASEK (4. 00 [*]Â±[*] 0. 43 versus 3. 17 [*]Â±[*] 0. 6 days). On day 1, ocular discomfort was significantly higher after <b>transepithelial</b> PRK. The grade of haze, keratocyte apoptosis, and greyscale value in confocal microscopy were significantly higher in <b>transepithelial</b> PRK-treated eyes at 1 month. All <b>transepithelial</b> PRK- and LASEK-treated eyes achieved 20 / 25 or better UCVA and were within Â± 1. 00 [*]D of emmetropia at final visits. Conclusions. Both <b>transepithelial</b> PRK and LASEK offer effective correction of myopia at 1 year. However, LASEK appeared to induce less discomfort and less intense wound healing in the early postoperative period...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} <b>transepithelial</b> ionic permeation via the paracellular pathway of human Caco- 2 epithelial monolayers and its contribution to absorption of the base guanidine. METHODS Confluent monolayers of Caco- 2 epithelial cells were mounted in Ussing chambers and the <b>transepithelial</b> conductance and electrical potential difference (p. d.) determined after NaCl dilution or medium Na substitution (bi-ionic conditions). Guanidine absorption (Ja-b) was measured +/- <b>transepithelial</b> potential gradients using bi-ionic p. d. 's. RESULTS Basal NaCl replacement with mannitol gives a <b>transepithelial</b> dilution p. d. of 28. 0 +/- 3. 1 mV basal solution electropositive (PCl/PNa = 0. 34). Bi-ionic p. d. 's (basal replacements) indicate a cation selectivity of NH 4 + > K+ approximately Cs+ > Na+ > Li+ > tetraethylammonium+ > N-methyl-D: -glucamine+ approximately choline+. <b>Transepithelial</b> conductances show good correspondence with bi-ionic potential data. Guanidine Ja-b was markedly sensitive to imposed <b>transepithelial</b> potential difference. The ratio of guanidine to mannitol permeability (measured simultaneously) increased from 3. 6 in the absence of an imposed p. d. to 13. 8 (basolateral negative p. d.). CONCLUSIONS Hydrated monovalent ions preferentially permeate the paracellular pathway (Eisenman sequence 2 or 3). Guanidine may access the paracellular pathway because absorptive flux is sensitive to the <b>transepithelial</b> potential difference. An alternative method to assess paracellular-mediated flux of charged organic molecules is suggested...|$|E
