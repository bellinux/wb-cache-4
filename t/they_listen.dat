25|$|In the {{language}} mode framework, language processing mechanisms and languages {{as a whole}} can be achieved to different extents. The relative activation state of language is called language mode, and it is influenced by many factors, such as the person spoken or listened to, users’ language proficiency, the nonlinguistic context and so on. Language users can be in a bilingual mode if they are talking to other bilinguals or reading text with mixed languages. However, if <b>they</b> <b>listen</b> {{to someone who is}} monolingual or is just speaking one language, the activation state would switch to a more monolingual mode. Based on this model, the bilinguals' language mode depends on {{the language}} users' expectation and by language environment.|$|E

25|$|Many {{students}} {{listen to}} music while they study. Many of these students maintain that the reasons why <b>they</b> <b>listen</b> to music are to prevent drowsiness and to maintain their arousal for study. Some even believe that background music facilitates better work performance. However, Salame and Baddeley (1989) showed that both vocal and instrumental music interfered with performance of linguistic memory. They explained that disturbance in performance was caused by task-irrelevant phonological information using resources in the working memory system. This disturbance {{can be explained by}} the fact that the linguistic component of music can occupy the phonological loop, similar to the way speech does. This is further demonstrated by the fact that vocal music has been perceived to interfere more with memory than instrumental music and nature sound music. Rolla (1993) explains that lyrics, being language, develop images that allow for the interpretation of experience in the communicative process. Current research coincides with this idea and maintains that the sharing of experience by language in song may communicate feeling and mood much more directly than either language itself or instrumental music alone. Vocal music also affects emotion and mood much more swiftly than instrumental music. However, Fogelson (1973) reported instrumental music interfered with children's performance on a reading comprehension test.|$|E

However, his cousin Donnel Feaster, an alumnus of John Bartram High School, recommended that Garland attend his alma mater.

The play is an immersive performance piece where audience members {{sit in a}} circle and wear audio headsets, through which <b>they</b> <b>listen</b> to the charismatic leader's voice and sound effects. The production ran from May 29, 2008 to June 14, 2008.|$|E

500|$|On 4 April, while {{preparing}} the final mixes of the song, in stereo and mono, Harrison added crowd laughter {{taken from a}} sound effects tape in the Abbey Road library. Martin and Emerick were both opposed to this addition but deferred to Harrison, who later said that the laughter provided [...] "some light relief", adding: [...] "You were supposed to hear the audience anyway, as <b>they</b> <b>listen</b> to Sergeant Pepper's Show." [...] The completed recording was enhanced in the mixes through the liberal application of automatic double tracking. Before Harrison recorded his vocals the previous day, the track had been edited and then sped up so that its length was reduced from 6:25 to 5:05. In the process, the song's key was raised a semitone, to C.|$|E

500|$|Bill Lamb for About.com {{noted that}} [...] "If I Never See Your Face Again" [...] and [...] "Makes Me Wonder" [...] {{appeared}} to be inspired by British jazz funk and acid jazz band Jamiroquai, writing [...] "Any Jamiroquai fan may call foul if <b>they</b> <b>listen</b> to 'If I Never See Your Face Again' or 'Makes Me Wonder'." [...] Sal Cinquemani was critical of the song, labeling it as [...] "nasty." [...] Alex Fletcher for Digital Spy disapproved of the collaboration between the band and Rihanna, with specific thoughts on Levine and Rihanna's pairing. Fletcher was critical of their vocal performance, writing that their voices clashed {{with one another and}} that [...] "the sexual chemistry radar for the pairing registers at zero." [...] Fletcher commented about the song further, writing that it should never have left the recording studio.|$|E

500|$|In an interview, Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin {{revealed}} that the song was written in mid-2004 and was inspired by Martin's daughter, Apple, and English alternative rock singer Kate Bush: [...] "That's a song where we were listening {{to a lot of}} Kate Bush last summer, and we wanted a song which had a lot of tom-toms in it. I just had my daughter up also, and was kind of feeling in a sense of awe and wonderment, so the song is kind of a Kate Bush song about miracles." [...] The drumbeat of the song was inspired by Bush's 1985 song [...] "Running Up that Hill". In a separate interview, bassist Guy Berryman said: [...] "We were really trying to recreate the drums on that song for this song, and the chords. Some bands are reluctant to admit that they take things from other artists and bands that <b>they</b> <b>listen</b> to and we're shameless in that respect, we don't mind telling." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Rather Die Young" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Beyoncé Beyoncé, Jeff Bhasker, and Luke Steele at Enormous Studios, in Los Angeles, in 2011. Cole Kamen-Green, Alex Asher and Josiah Woodson played the trumpets while Nick Videen and Drew Sayers {{were on the}} tenor and alto saxophones. The horn were arranged by Shea Taylor. Jordan Young then recorded Beyoncé's vocals at the MSR Studios and KMA Studios, in New York City; Steele and Billy Kraven served as background vocalists. Tony Maserati mixed the track, while Pete Wolford, Ryan Kelly, Serge Nudel, Justin Hergett and Jon Castelliall all assisted in the audio engineering of [...] "Rather Die Young"; both tasks were executed at the RMC Studio, in Los Angeles. Speaking about what motivated her to record a song in the vein of [...] "Rather Die Young", Beyoncé said: [...] "I really {{want people to think}} when <b>they</b> <b>listen</b> to my music. I want it to help them through their painful memories, their painful moments, and their most happy moments. I want it to be a conversation." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{problems}} Maya encounters in her childhood stem from the overt racism of her white neighbors. Although Mamma is relatively wealthy because she owns the general store {{at the heart of}} Stamps' Black community, the white children of their town hassle Maya's family relentlessly. One of these [...] "powhitetrash" [...] girls, for example, reveals her pubic hair to Momma in a humiliating incident. Early in the book, Momma hides Uncle Willie in a vegetable bin to protect him from Ku Klux Klan raiders. Maya has to endure the insult of her name being changed to Mary by a racist employer. A white speaker at her eighth grade graduation ceremony disparages the Black audience by suggesting that they have limited job opportunities. A white dentist refuses to treat Maya's rotting tooth, even when Momma reminds him that she had loaned him money during the Depression. The Black community of Stamps enjoys a moment of racial victory when <b>they</b> <b>listen</b> to the radio broadcast of Joe Louis's championship fight, but generally, they feel the heavy weight of racist oppression.|$|E

500|$|... "From This Moment On" [...] {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Matt Bjorke of About.com deemed the song {{as one of}} the album's highlights, while Elizabeth Kessler of Yahoo! commented that [...] "hardly any song can compare to this love anthem! ... Everyone feels their insides tug as <b>they</b> <b>listen</b> to this heart wrenching song." [...] Country Universe writer Kevin John Coyne did separate reviews for [...] "From This Moment On". While reviewing the duet, Coyne graded it a B and commented that it was mostly a showcase of White's vocals, [...] "who turns in some signature licks and makes Twain seem a bit bland in comparison. [...] However, it also gives the song a bit of a mid-eighties Peter Cetera vibe, which hasn’t held up well over time." [...] Coyne concluded, however, that the single release turned the track [...] "into a potent solo number," [...] and noted that [...] "the addition of a Spanish-flavored guitar that borrowed heavily from 'Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman' [...] gave the ballad added oomph." [...] He graded the single release at an A-. At the 1999 Canadian Country Music Awards, [...] "From This Moment On" [...] won the award for Vocal/Instrumental Collaboration of the Year.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{wrote the}} Hindustani {{classical}} music-inspired [...] "Within You Without You" [...] after {{the decision was}} made to abandon his composition [...] "Only a Northern Song", which the band had recorded earlier in the sessions. The lyrics reflect Harrison's immersion in the teachings of the Hindu Vedas while the song's musical form and Indian instrumentation, such as sitar, tabla, dilrubas and tamburas, recall the Hindu devotional tradition known as bhajan. The track features a tempo rubato that is without precedent in the Beatles' catalogue. The pitch is derived from the eastern Khamaj scale, which is akin to the Mixolydian mode in the West. MacDonald regards the song as [...] "the most distant departure from the staple Beatles sound in their discography", and a work that represents the [...] "conscience" [...] of the LP through the lyrics' rejection of Western materialism. Womack calls it [...] "quite arguably, the album's ethical soul" [...] as a concise reflection of the Beatles' and the counterculture's perspective during the Summer of Love era. The track ends with a burst of laughter that some listeners interpret as a mockery of the song, but Harrison explained: [...] "It's a release after five minutes of sad music... You were supposed to hear the audience anyway, as <b>they</b> <b>listen</b> to Sergeant Pepper's Show. That was the style of the album." [...] Martin used the moment of levity as a segue for what he describes as the album's [...] "jokey track" [...] – [...] "When I'm Sixty-Four".|$|E
500|$|Later, as Brian and Stewie {{drive home}} from his day care, <b>they</b> <b>listen</b> to the 2006 single [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] on the car's radio, sung by American Idol winner Carrie Underwood. Stewie stays in the car after {{arriving}} home {{to listen to the}} rest of the song, and sings along. Pleased with himself, he decides he should appear on the Fox television series Glee. Later Stewie learns of a contest to win tickets to a local Justin Bieber concert, but ultimately he loses the contest to his neighbor, Herbert. After returning home, Stewie begins watching a film parodying various 1970s science fiction movies (including music parodying the 1976 Michael York film Logan's Run) before being accused by Brian of crashing his car. When Stewie tries to reject blame for the incident, Brian tells him that he must accept his punishment, and compares it to the television game show The Price Is Right, in which a woman is shown accepting a poor showcase, involving a weeklong trip to her parent's house in Wilmington, Delaware. Stewie then runs away from home, leaving a video message for Brian asking Brian to rescue him in a TV-movie-clichéd way at the airport, and to bring appropriate soundtrack music, suggesting [...] "With or Without You" [...] by U2, [...] "Solsbury Hill" [...] by Peter Gabriel, [...] "Unwritten" [...] by Natasha Bedingfield, [...] "Live Like We're Dying" [...] by Kris Allen, [...] "Thank You" [...] by Dido and [...] "Somebody" [...] by Depeche Mode.|$|E
