30|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} assignment color inference in two experiments. Experiment 1 tested whether people perform local or global assignment {{in a simple}} scenario with two objects (paper and trash) and sets of two colors. We chose paper and trash because the colors most associated with these objects are distinct (see Fig.  4 and Additional file 1 : Table S 2). This avoids conflicts that arise from one-to-many and many-to-one mappings and therefore makes the task relatively easy, at least {{when one of the}} colors is strongly associated with paper and the other is strongly associated with <b>trash.</b> Experiment 2 <b>tested</b> whether people can still perform assignment inference with a larger set of six objects and six colors that contain conflicts due to one-to-many and many-to-one mappings. These conflicts make the task of selecting which six colors to use a nontrivial one. We determined which colors to use by designing different merit functions and solving the corresponding encoding assignment problems.|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The prediction of emission concentrations from cyclone collectors is integral to the permitting of agricultural facilities including cotton gins. One method for predicting emission concentrations utilizes fractional efficiency curves (FEC's). A new engineering procedure to develop the fractional efficiency curves was developed, and the new and more accurate fractional efficiency curves were generated by using this procedure. The FEC's were used to compare performance of the four cyclone designs currently being used by cotton gins to abate PM 10. The performance characteristics of the 1 D 2 D, 1 D 3 D, 2 D 2 D and Barrel cyclones were evaluated using particulate matter from three types of cotton gin trash. The results suggest that the 1 D 3 D cyclone is the best design for fine dust or trash without lint fiber, and the 1 D 2 D design is better than the 1 D 3 D and 2 D 2 D cyclones when the tests were conducted with high lint content <b>trash.</b> The <b>test</b> results were used to define the performance characteristics of different cyclone designs. With these characteristics, cotton gins can utilize different cyclone designs for different processing streams to minimize PM concentrations emitted. The effect of smoothness of cyclone inner surface on its emission concentration was tested. The results were used to quantify this effect...|$|R

These {{consisted}} of some archaeological work on small, medium, and large plantation house sites {{off the coast}} of Georgia, and excavations of slave quarters. He also worked under the direction of Charles H. Fairbanks, by excavating and <b>testing</b> <b>trash</b> pits associated with 19th-century Orange Hall, a parsonage in St. Mary's, Georgia. Under Fairbanks, Des Jean also worked on the expansion of a Deerfield coal fired generating station in Florida, as well as the excavation of slave cabins associated with the King Plantation in Georgia. He {{went on to become a}} graduate assistant for various field schools, including at an “Orange II” Late Archaic period campsite. Late Archaic refers to a period from about 5,900 years ago to 3,200 years ago. It was a period characterized by a greater utilization of mussels and other water-available sources. [...] He also worked on the stable and plantation house on the Georgia coast in the Kings Bay Project area. During the Kings Bay Project he also worked on Early Archaic, Orange II, Swift Creek, and Savannah I sites.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — For many {{promising}} application areas, au-tonomous mobile manipulators {{do not yet}} exhibit sufficiently robust performance. We {{propose the}} use of tags applied to task-relevant locations in human environments {{in order to help}} autonomous mobile manipulators physically interact with the location, perceive the location, and understand the location’s semantics. We call these tags physical, perceptual and semantic tags (PPS-tags). We present three examples of PPS-tags, each of which combines compliant and colorful material with a UHF RFID tag. The RFID tag provides a unique identifier that indexes into a semantic database that holds information such as the following: what actions can be performed at the location, how can these actions be performed, and what state changes should be observed upon task success? We also present performance results for our robot operating on a PPS-tagged light switch, rocker light switch, lamp, drawer, and <b>trash</b> can. We <b>tested</b> the robot performing the available actions from 4 distinct locations with each of these 5 tagged devices. For the light switch, rocker light switch, lamp, and trash can, the robot succeeded in all trials (24 / 24). The robot failed to open the drawer when starting from an oblique angle, and thus succeeded in 6 out of 8 trials. We also tested the ability of the robot to detect failure in unusual circumstances, such as the lamp being unplugged and the drawer being stuck. I...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{takes the}} {{opportunity}} of the fortieth anniversary of Katz v. U. S. to assess whether the revolutionary case 2 ̆ 7 s potential to provide broad and flexible privacy protection to individuals has been realized. Answering this question in a circumspect way, the Article pinpoints the language in Katz that was its eventual undoing and demonstrates how the Katz test {{has been plagued by}} two principle problems that have often rendered it more harmful to than protective of privacy. The manipulation problem describes the tendency of conservative courts to define reasonable expectations of privacy as lower than the expectations society actually entertains. The normativity problem captures the idea that the Katz test allows reasonable expectations to be set by those who engage in normatively disfavored privacy defeating conduct. The Article then concentrates on two specific doctrines exemplary of these problems, the third party doctrine and the contraband exception, and discusses their ruinous effects on privacy in a technological era. The third party doctrine, which roughly holds that third party exposure defeats privacy interests, has severely hampered the ability of the Katz test to afford Fourth Amendment protection to intimate online communications. Likewise, the contraband exception, which holds that there is no legitimate expectation of privacy in illegal items, proves exceedingly dangerous to privacy as crime detection technology becomes increasingly refined. In the end, however, this Article does not advocate <b>trashing</b> the Katz <b>test,</b> but rather suggests methods of interpretation that remedy the manipulation and normativity problems...|$|R
40|$|In {{the history}} of cyber-fiction in comics there have been bizarre cities with both utopian and dystopian foundations. Mostly located in the future, those urbanscapes are built in space to be {{recognizable}} from the present. In fact, they are inevitably linked to variations of our everyday territories. In comics like Dan O’Bannon and Moebius’ The Long Tomorrow (1975) or Warren Ellis and Darick Richardson’s Transmetropolitan series (1997 - 2002), cities are characterized and designed as merged environments and inverted punk territories. Urban places become sites of addiction and starvation while technological enterprises continue rising. Mainly set in Europe and North America, the future exposed in these science fiction comics seems rather ungracious and grotesque. Metropolises have grown overscaled and overrated as Paris, London, the generic Cité or The City (a continental compound of New York City, Chicago and San Francisco) have turned into recognizable cities with disturbances and awkward morphologies. Banal places and exquisite architectures become obsolete and opposite versions of themselves. Economic conflicts or politic scandals bring social anarchy and urban-biological ambiguity to these places and their inhabitants. In science fiction comics, protagonists like Pete Club, Alcide Nikopol, Spider Jerusalem or Michael (Desolation) Jones drift through the streets, towers and <b>trash,</b> solving mysteries, <b>testing</b> drugs, and exploring vicious media circles. Paradoxically, these fictions produce a common and complex sense of disenchantment in human and urban promises, as if fiction was just a symbol of our monstrous realities. Mostly based in science fiction comics, this chapter aims at revealing resonances and representations of the contemporary human and urban aberrancies within the graphic genre. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|The {{patented}} VAC*TRAX {{process was}} designed {{in response to}} the need to remove organic constituents from mixed waste, waste that contains both a hazardous (RCRA or TSCA regulated) component and a radioactive component. Separation of the mixed waste into its hazardous and radioactive components allows for ultimate disposal of the material at existing, permitted facilities. The VAC*TRAX technology consists of a jacketed vacuum dryer followed by a condensing train. Solids are placed in the dryer and indirectly heated to temperatures as high as 260 {degrees}C, while a strong vacuum (down to 50 mm Hg absolute pressure) is applied to the system and the dryer is purged with a nitrogen carrier gas. The organic contaminants in the solids are thermally desorbed, swept up in the carrier gas and into the condensing train where they are cooled and recovered. The dryer is fitted with a filtration system that keeps the radioactive constituents from migrating to the condensate. As such, the waste is separated into hazardous liquid and radioactive solid components, allowing for disposal of these streams at a permitted incinerator or a radioactive materials landfill, respectively. The VAC*TRAX system is designed to be highly mobile, while minimizing the operational costs with a simple, robust process. These factors allow for treatment of small waste streams at a reasonable cost. This paper describes the VAC*TRAX thermal desorption process, as well as results from the pilot testing program. Also, the design and application of the full-scale treatment system is presented. Materials tested to date include spiked soil and debris, power plant trash and sludge contaminated with solvents, PCB contaminated soil, solvent-contaminated uranium mill-tailings, and solvent and PCB-contaminated sludge and <b>trash.</b> Over 70 <b>test</b> runs have been performed using the pilot VAC*TRAX system, with more than 80 % of the tests using mixed waste as the feed material...|$|R
