25|$|A 2004 {{study by}} Consumers Reports in New Zealand found that 80% of {{department}} store bra fittings {{resulted in a}} poor fit.

5000|$|Fitting rooms, or [...] "dressing rooms", are {{rooms where}} people <b>try</b> <b>on</b> clothes, {{such as in}} a {{department}} store. The rooms are usually individual rooms {{in which a person}} <b>tries</b> <b>on</b> clothes to determine fit before making a purchase. People do not always use the fitting rooms to change, as to change implies to remove one set of clothes and put on another. Sometimes a person chooses to <b>try</b> <b>on</b> clothes over their clothes (such as sweaters or coats), but would still like to do this in private. Thus fitting rooms may be used for changing, or just for fitting without changing.|$|R

He may even run off with a shiny keepsake or two. Like an inquisitive child, he leaves a mess behind, which means a red-faced Tarzan and the other family members are usually stuck with cleaning up after him. His mischief, however, sometimes ends up doing more good than first assumed, especially where the villainous Samuel Philander was concerned.|$|E

25|$|In essence, this {{technique}} is a statistical method of assessing the behavior of incoming requests to detect if something unusual or abnormal is going on. Imagine {{if you were to}} observe the behavior of normal, paying customers at a brick-and-mortar department store. On average, they would spend in aggregate a known percentage of time on different activities such as picking up items and examining them, putting them back on shelves, <b>trying</b> <b>on</b> clothes, filling a basket, waiting in line, paying for their purchases, and leaving. These high-level activities correspond to the Key Completion Indicators in a service or site, and once normal behavior is determined, abnormal behavior can be identified. For example, if a huge number of customers arrive and spend all their time picking up items and setting them down, but never making any purchases, this can be flagged as unusual behavior.|$|E
25|$|Hazumu's parents, {{her father}} , {{and her mother}} , are almost always shown {{together}} throughout the series. When Hazumu goes missing after getting rejected from Yasuna, both of Hazumu's parents are completely distraught, and {{do not know what}} to do. After Hazumu's transformation, both parents become overjoyed to have a daughter in place of a son which is shown through their eccentricities. Toru works as a magazine photographer and loves to take pictures of Hazumu any chance he gets; often this is after his wife has already dressed Hazumu in some feminine garment. Additionally, Hazumu's father repeatedly attempts to take a bath with Hazumu, but is always stopped by his wife. Kahoru loves to buy feminine clothes for Hazumu to wear, and buys these clothes without consulting Hazumu herself, though regardless she finds herself wearing them anyway. Directly after Hazumu turned into a girl, her mother even goes ahead and buys her a female school uniform to wear from now on. Hazumu becomes annoyed by her parents' new behavior toward her, and finds <b>trying</b> <b>on</b> her new clothes very tiring. When Hazumu bakes cookies for the first time, Kahoru loves it, but Toru simply wolfs down most of the cookies for himself. Since his mother had always wanted a daughter instead of son, she often dressed Hazumu up in young girl's clothes, saying that gender discrimination is not a good thing.|$|E
