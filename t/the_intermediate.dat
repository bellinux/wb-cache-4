40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{induction}} period before the nucleation and growth of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots. Here, we introduce an approach that allows us to probe <b>intermediates</b> present in <b>the</b> induction period. We show that this induction period itself exhibits distinct stages with the evolution of <b>the</b> <b>intermediates,</b> first without and then with the formation of covalent bonds between metal cations and chalcogenide anions. <b>The</b> <b>intermediates</b> are optically invisible in toluene, while <b>the</b> covalent-bonded <b>intermediates</b> become visible as magic-size clusters when a primary amine is added. Such evolution of magic-size clusters provides indirect but compelling evidence for the presence of <b>the</b> <b>intermediates</b> in <b>the</b> induction period and supports the multi-step nucleation model. Our study reveals that magic-size clusters could be readily engineered in a single-size form, and suggests that the existence of <b>the</b> <b>intermediates</b> during <b>the</b> growth of conventional quantum dots results in low product yield.

30|$|As {{observed}} in the fitted UV–vis spectra, the absorption peaks derived from <b>the</b> <b>intermediates</b> shifted to <b>the</b> shorter wavelength {{compared with that of}} MB, implying that the smaller conjunction system contained in <b>the</b> <b>intermediates</b> than that of in MB molecular [30, 31]. In addition, the previous studies also revealed that the aromatic molecules could be adsorbed on the surfaces of both Pt and Ni [32 – 36]. Therefore, it is speculated that the catalytic degradation of MB molecules involved the adsorption of MB molecules on the surfaces of Pt 3 Ni NPs, the subsequent formation and degradation of <b>the</b> <b>intermediates</b> on <b>the</b> active sites of Pt 3 Ni NPs. More investigations are being undergone to explore the precise formation and degradation mechanisms of <b>the</b> <b>intermediates</b> during <b>the</b> catalytic degradation of MB by Pt 3 Ni NPs.|$|R

Ammonium polyphosphate (APP) is an effective material as halogen-free flame retardants, it has six crystalline forms.
