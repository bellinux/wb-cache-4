5|$|Landfill use created Burnham Park and Northerly Island in the 1920s and 1930s along Lake Michigan. The Field Museum of Natural History, Soldier Field, Adler Planetarium and the John G. Shedd Aquarium were {{constructed}} on this newly reclaimed land at this time. Later, Merrill C. Meigs Field Airport was built. Northerly Island {{connects to the}} rest of the Museum Campus <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> isthmus along Solidarity Drive dominated by Neoclassical sculptures of Kościuszko, Havliček and Nicolaus Copernicus.|$|E
5|$|The Austrian troops {{advanced}} from Alessandria eastwards {{across the}} Bormida river by two bridges debouching {{in a narrow}} bend of the river (the river being not easily crossed elsewhere). Poor Austrian staff work prevented any rapid development of their attack and the entire army had to file <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> bridgehead. The movement began about 6 am with the first shots fired around 8 am, but the attack was not fully developed until 9 am.|$|E

5|$|The {{valley of}} Darby Creek is {{considerably}} narrower in its upper reaches, but widens out as it approaches the Delaware River. Numerous {{reaches of the}} creek have been armored with boulders or riprap. Upstream of the tributary Cobbs Creek, the stream's channel is sinuous and the creek flows <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> valley bordered by low, steep hills. From Cobbs Creek downstream to its mouth, the creek is in a tidal flat.|$|E
5|$|After being marched {{two miles}} north-west {{of the city}} centre, the victims {{encountered}} a barbed wire barrier and numerous Ukrainian police and German troops. Thirty or forty people at a time were told to leave their possessions and were escorted <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> passageway lined with soldiers brandishing clubs. Anyone who tried to escape was beaten. Soon the victims reached an open area, where {{they were forced to}} strip, and then were herded down into the ravine. People were forced to lie down in rows on top of the bodies of other victims, and they were shot {{in the back of the}} head or the neck by members of the execution squads.|$|E
5|$|At Willsboro, Route22 {{heads to}} the {{northwest}} again, away from the lake, until it heads west and intersects US9 {{in the town of}} Chesterfield, the other major north–south surface route up the state's eastern side. Routes22 and 9 join together, closely parallel to the Adirondack Northway (I-87), the only other route in the state to directly connect New York City with Canada. The three routes, spread over many miles {{in the southern part of}} the state, run <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> corridor for two miles (3km) until Routes9 and 22 veer east again toward Keeseville.|$|E

5|$|Darby Creek flows <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> {{valley in}} its upper reaches and a tidal flat in its lower reaches. The creek {{is in the}} Piedmont Uplands and Atlantic Coastal Plain physiographic provinces. Major rock {{formations}} in the watershed include the Wissahickon Formation. Three small dams historically existed on the creek, but were removed in 2012. The watershed of the creek is largely developed, with roughly {{half a million people}} inhabiting it. Most of the watershed is in Delaware County, but some parts are in Chester County, Philadelphia County, and Montgomery County. The watershed is part of the Lower Delaware drainage basin.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{as a basic}} L-shaped tower {{built from}} tooled ashlar dressed rubble, the castle was {{extended}} in a southerly direction {{by the addition of}} a circular tower during the first alterations in the late 16th century. A staircase was inside the new tower and further structures were added to the south and north sides of the courtyard {{at this stage of the}} development. Replacement entrances were installed and the original first-floor doorway was closed off. Access on the west side was gained <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> round-headed entrance and a wider main doorway was incorporated in the south elevation.|$|E
5|$|The creek flows {{generally}} south-southwest <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> coastal watershed at {{the southern}} extreme end of the arid Los Angeles Basin in a fairly straight course. Owing to the submersion of Southern California in the Pacific Ocean as recently as 10million years ago, the creek flows over marine sedimentary rock that dates from the late Eocene to the Pliocene. The present-day form of the watershed, with its broad sediment-filled valleys and deeply eroded side canyons, was shaped by a climate change during the previous Ice Age that produced Aliso Canyon, the creek's final gorge.|$|E

Towards the end of the video, Adam Levine is seen walking <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> corridor dragging a guitar with pictures {{on both sides of the}} wall fading in and out. When he reaches the end of the corridor, he is face to face with a wall with a small light coming out of it and then flings his guitar backwards and then pounds on the wall. The camera then quickly moves to a scene of the band playing and the lights suddenly flickering on.|$|E
5|$|Within Lake Forest Park, SR522 {{is named}} Bothell Way, and follows the {{northern}} shore of Lake Washington. SR522 intersects Ballinger Way (SR104) at the city's downtown shopping center, and {{is joined by}} the Burke-Gilman Trail running along the lakefront. Bothell Way continues east along the northern shore of Lake Washington through the city of Kenmore, passing the Kenmore Air Harbor seaplane base and {{the mouth of the}} Sammamish River. SR522 travels upriver <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> valley that makes a sharp turn north towards Bothell. The highway turns east, passing downhill of the city's downtown business district, staying near the Sammamish River (and the Sammamish River Trail) and intersecting Bothell Way (formerly SR527). Leaving Bothell, SR522 passes around the southern edge of University of Washington Bothell campus and intersects I-405, becoming a grade-separated freeway.|$|E
5|$|At the {{northern}} edge of the park, the Meadowbrook enters exitM6, a partial cloverleaf interchange with several flyover ramps connecting to the Southern State Parkway. After the Southern State interchange, the Meadowbrook continues north <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> park known as Barnum Woods, which separates the heavily developed neighborhoods of Uniondale to the west and East Meadow to the east. The highway passes over NY102 (Front Street) with no connection before leaving Barnum Woods and bending northward near exitM5 and the northbound half of exitM4, which serve NY24 (Hempstead Turnpike) and several other local streets by way of a series of service roads in the vicinity of Eisenhower Park, Nassau Coliseum, and Mitchel Field. After another mile (1.6km), the Meadowbrook makes a turn to the west and enters exitM4 southbound and exitM3, which connect to Stewart Avenue (unsigned CR177) via Merchants Concourse. ExitM3 also serves Nassau Community College, located just southwest of the Meadowbrook Parkway.|$|E
50|$|From Roseburg, the Umpqua flows {{generally}} northwest through broad farming valleys in the Oregon Coast Range in a serpentine course {{past the}} settlement of Umpqua and the city Elkton. At Elkton, it turns to flow west <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> canyon past Scottsburg, which {{is located at the}} head of tide. It enters Winchester Bay on the Pacific near Reedsport. It receives the Smith River from the north near its estuary on Winchester Bay. The Umpqua River Light protects ships nearing the mouth of the river.|$|R

40|$|Nager {{syndrome}} (preaxial acrofacial dysostosis) is {{rare and}} mostly sporadic. We present {{a case of}} Nager syndrome in Taiwan. Craniofacial findings included micrognathia, malar hypoplasia, downslanting palpebral fissures, cleft palate, and ear anomalies. Radial defects consisted of hypoplastic thumb, short forearm, and proximal radioulnar synostosis. Patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, lower limb deformities, and uncommon flat nasal bridge were noted. Nasal endotube passing <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrowing</b> oropharynx region or oral airway is life-saving before tracheostomy is performed on patients with Nager syndrome and restricted jaw opening and glossoptosis...|$|R
5|$|Commanding 75 lances from Kinsky's company, and {{followed}} by {{the bulk of his}} force, Nassau passed <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> path in a small forest, and, coming out to open field, was surprised by the Spanish troops, namely by those under Hendrik van den Bergh, followed by Carlo Maria Caracciolo and the 's-Hertogenbosch lances. Van den Bergh's harquebusiers, discovering the Dutch column emerging from the forest, fired a volley and, turning right, clashed with the Dutch scouts, starting the action. There was then a firece fight. The Dutch troops were formed into eight squadrons, but caught by surprise in a narrow passage, the Dutch soldiers were unable to use their lances, so they were forced to defend themselves with swords and pistols. Philip of Nassau, his brothers and their cousin Ernst von Solms were seriously wounded and dismounted at the beginning the fight. Kinsky's and Balen's troops, coming in relief, were unable to rescue the wounded commanders, and some Dutch soldiers started to flee from the battlefield. Nicholas Parker, however, managed to collect the fugitives and, renewing the action, he put disorder into the Spanish cavalry. The encounter turned then a general action out the wood, in open ground.|$|E
5|$|Early in the advance, Maxwell's company {{commander}} was severely wounded, resulting in Maxwell assuming control. Reaching the German barbwire defences under intense machine-gun fire, the company suffered heavy casualties, including {{all of the}} officers except Maxwell. Pushing forward alone <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> passageway in the wire, Maxwell captured the most dangerous machine gun, killed three Germans and took another four as prisoners; thereby enabling the company {{to move through the}} wire and reach their objective. Shortly afterwards, it was noticed that the company on their left flank was held up and failing to advance. Gathering a party of men, Maxwell led the group in an attempt to attack the German force from the rear. They soon came under heavy machine gun fire, and, single-handedly, Maxwell dashed forward and attacked the foremost gun. Firing his revolver, he managed to shoot five of the crew and silence the gun.|$|E
5|$|In 1525 Pedro de Alvarado sent a {{small company}} to conquer Mixco Viejo (Chinautla Viejo), {{the capital of the}} Poqomam. At the Spanish approach, the {{inhabitants}} remained enclosed in the fortified city. The Spanish attempted an approach from the west <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> pass but were forced back with heavy losses. Alvarado himself launched the second assault with 200 Tlaxcalan allies but was also beaten back. The Poqomam then received reinforcements, possibly from Chinautla, and the two armies clashed on open ground outside of the city. The battle was chaotic and lasted {{for most of the day}} but was finally decided by the Spanish cavalry, forcing the Poqomam reinforcements to withdraw. The leaders of the reinforcements surrendered to the Spanish three days after their retreat and revealed that the city had a secret entrance in the form of a cave leading up from a nearby river, allowing the inhabitants to come and go.|$|E

5|$|In September 1330, Charles {{launched}} a military expedition against Basarab of Wallachia who {{had attempted to}} get rid of his suzerainty. After seizing the fortress of Severin (present-day Drobeta-Turnu Severin in Romania), he refused to make peace with Basarab and marched towards Curtea de Argeș, which was Basarab's seat. The Wallachians applied scorched earth tactics, compelling Charles to make a truce with Basarab and withdraw his troops from Wallachia. While the royal troops were marching <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> pass across the Southern Carpathians on 9November, the Wallachians ambushed them. During the next four days, the royal army was decimated; Charles could only escape from the battlefield after changing his clothes with one of his knights, Desiderius Héder, who sacrificed his life to enable the king's escape. Charles did not attempt a new invasion of Wallachia, which subsequently developed into an independent principality.|$|E
5|$|Ranch Road 1 {{begins at}} US 290 {{on the west}} side of Stonewall, as a two-lane, paved road. The highway follows along the south bank of the Pedernales River around the town's north side and intersects RM 1623 on the town's east side. The route {{continues}} along the river briefly passing <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> southwestern portion of Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, before entering Lyndon B Johnson State Park and Historic Site. The route crosses the length of the state park at its northern edge along the riverbank and exits the park before intersecting PR 49, which crosses the river accessing the national historic site. After crossing into Blanco County, the route turns away from the riverbank to the southeast returning to US 290 west of Hye. Although the road is located in the Texas Hill Country, the road only encounters gentle grades within the channel of the Pedernales River.|$|E
5|$|Sera Chöding Hermitage (Se ra chos sdings ri khrod) was a tantric college (rgyud smad grwa tshang) {{before the}} 1959 Cultural Revolution. Located close to Sera and facing south, {{it has a}} yellow retreat house which was built first for the Tsongkhapa. The {{interesting}} story of this house is that a local 'site-spirit' (gzhi bdag) used to visit Tsongkhapa <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> window in the house. Tsong kha pa’s mural image is seen here on the wall, which is credited with special powers as an “image that speaks” or known as speaking-statue (gsung byon ma). It was Tsongkhapa's favourite hermitage where he spent substantial time and composed his magnamopus, the “Great Commentary on the Prajñāmūla (Rtsa shes Dīk chen). He also taught here. It {{is also known as}} the hermitage where Tsongkhapa assigned his Tantric teachings to Rje shes rab seng ge (1383–1445), the founder of the Tantric Colleges.|$|E
50|$|The {{condition}} is usually detected during puppy {{visits to the}} veterinarian by hearing a heart murmur during physical examination. A heart murmur is the abnormal sound of blood rushing {{through one of the}} heart valves. Instead of just the heartbeat, a whistle of blood flow <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrowed</b> opening is heard. The puppy will most likely appear normal in all other respects. There is a possibility that the murmur may come and go, or it may develop slowly; this can be determined by frequent checks of a puppy's heart during its first few months. The chance for long-term survival of SAS is low.|$|R
