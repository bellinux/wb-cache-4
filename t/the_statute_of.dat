5|$|As for the BIA's assurance, the Court {{that only}} {{meant that the}} {{termination}} act did not terminate the claim, not that <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitations would not begin to run. Because the Court of Appeals had only held that <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitation did not apply, not {{that it would not}} bar the claim if it applied, and the District Court had held the claim barred, the Court remanded to the Court of Appeals to pass on that conclusion of the District Court.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> Lithuania, {{originally}} {{known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grand Duchy of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos statutai, Belarusian: Статуты Вялікага княства Літоўскага, Polish: Statuty litewskie), were a 16th-century codification {{of all the}} legislation of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and its successor, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. <b>The</b> <b>Statutes</b> consist <b>of</b> three legal codes (1529, 1566 and 1588), all written in Ruthenian language, translated into Latin and later Polish. They {{formed the basis of}} the legal system of the Grand Duchy. One of the main sources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statutes</b> was Old Russian Law.|$|R

5|$|In November 1267, {{parliament}} met at Marlborough. Here {{an important}} provision was issued {{that would become}} known to history as <b>the</b> <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Marlborough. This statute incorporated the clauses of the Dictum of Kenilworth that dealt with the restoration of royal power, and reconciliation between the loyalists and the rebels. <b>The</b> <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Marlborough became a basis for royal government, {{and the relationship between}} the king and his subjects, and as such the Dictum lived on in English constitutional history.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of limitations (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitations was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably have been expected to discover the fraud or mistake. In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills. The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action. Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> limitations was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.|$|E

5|$|A {{siege of}} the castle was started, but through papal {{intervention}} King Henry later entered on a more conciliatory path. A commission was appointed to draw up an arrangement that would be acceptable to both sides. The resulting Dictum of Kenilworth offered the rebels {{the right to buy}} back forfeited estates, at prices depending on their level of involvement in the rebellion. After initial resistance, the terms were eventually accepted. By the summer of 1267, the country was pacified, and this spirit of reconciliation would last until the 1290s.

5|$|Coke became {{involved}} in the now classic Shelley's Case in 1581, which created a rule in real property that is still used in some common law jurisdictions today; the case also established Coke's reputation as an attorney and case reporter.
