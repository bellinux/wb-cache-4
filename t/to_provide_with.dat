5|$|Chopra is a {{supporter}} of environmental charities and is brand ambassador for NDTV Greenathon, an initiative to support eco-friendliness and provide solar power to rural villages without electricity supplies. She appeared with children in an animated video to support the cause, and removed rubbish from {{the banks of the}} Yamuna river in Agra to increase awareness of environmental issues. During the third and fourth editions of Greenathon, She adopted up to seven villages <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>with</b> a regular supply of electricity. She adopted a tigress in 2011 and a lioness in 2012 at the Birsa biological park, paying for both animals' upkeep for a year. To promote organ donation, Chopra pledged to donate her own organs after death and was co-keynote speaker at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Bollywood-themed 20th-anniversary celebration of its liver-transplant programme in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Tripura {{has high}} {{incidence}} of open defecation, especially in the interior hilly and forest areas. The state has extensively implemented Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan and currently the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and convergence with MGNREGS to address this problem. Schools and Anganwadi Center are focussed <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>with</b> urinals and latrines, separate {{for boys and girls}} aling with baby friendly toilets in Anganwadi Centers to inculcate the habit of using sanitary latrines in young age. However many toilets lie dysfuncational due to lack of maintenance and damage. Earlier schemes of providing plastic squatting plates, free of cost to people, has not produced results as most of them lie unused as many people cannot afford to construct a toilet. Open defecation has created problems of diarrhoea and vulnerability to malaria. The Chief Minister of Tripura has envisioned to make the state Open Defecation Free (ODF) by 2017.|$|E
25|$|Khan {{has pledged}} to further the cause of child {{education}} in India. He has recorded a series of public service announcements championing good health, child immunisation and proper nutrition, and joined India's Health Ministry and UNICEF in a nationwide child immunisation campaign as part of National Rural Health Mission of India. In 2011, he joined Amitabh Bachchan and Judi Dench to promote Resul Pookutty's foundation that works to improve the living conditions of underprivileged people in India. The same year, he received UNESCO's Pyramide con Marni award for his charitable commitment to provide education for children, becoming the first Indian to win the accolade. During his multiple appearances at the NDTV Greenathon, Khan has adopted up to twelve villages <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>with</b> electricity {{as part of the}} solar energy harnessing project's initiative Light A Billion Lives.|$|E

500|$|Beadle {{agreed with}} Smith that a deal ending UDI without any prior {{agreement}} on the replacement constitution would meet with widespread opposition among white Rhodesians, but still felt that Salisbury should agree. He asked Smith to commend the terms to his colleagues in Salisbury, speculating {{that if he did}} the Cabinet would surely accept. Smith refused to make such a commitment, much to the disappointment of Beadle and Gibbs, and signed the final document only to acknowledge it as an accurate record. Wilson was furious with Beadle, feeling that he should have taken a far firmer line to persuade Smith to settle; after Beadle left the meeting, Wilson said that he [...] "could not understand how any man could have a slipped disc whom Providence had failed <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>with</b> a backbone". Beadle and Gibbs urged Smith to reconsider during the journey home, but made little headway.|$|E
60|$|The {{lower classes}} {{of people in}} Europe may at some future period be much better {{instructed}} than they are at present; they may be taught to employ the little spare time they have in many better ways than at the ale-house; they may live under better and more equal laws than they have ever hitherto done, perhaps, in any country; and I even conceive it possible, though not probable {{that they may have}} more leisure; but it is not in the nature of things that they can be awarded such a quantity of money or subsistence as will allow them all to marry early, in the full confidence that they shall be able <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>with</b> ease for a numerous family.|$|E
60|$|In {{the course}} of the present session of Congress a bill was {{introduced}} for apportioning representatives among the people of the several States, according to the first enumeration. The constitution had provided that the number of representatives should not exceed one for every thirty thousand persons, and the House of Representatives passed a bill allotting to each State one member for this amount of population. This ratio would leave a fraction, greater or less, in each State. Its operation was unequal, as in some States a large surplus would be unrepresented, and hence, in one branch of the legislature, the relative power of the State be affected. That, too, was the popular branch, which those who feared a strong executive, desired <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>with</b> the counterpoise of as full a representation as possible.|$|E

50|$|In {{response}} to rapid industrialisation {{in the late}} 19th-century Europe, trade union and workers' parties emerged that challenged the social policies of governments. They gained passage of laws <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> workers <b>with</b> legal rights {{in the event of}} illness or accidents, in an attempt to prevent industrial action by industrial workers. Workers unions in turn started <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> workers <b>with</b> legal advice on their new economic, social and cultural rights. Demand for these services was high and in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> workers <b>with</b> non-partisan advice, many governments started <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> legal aid by the early 20th century.|$|R

"His Holiness the Pope, {{taking into}} {{consideration}} such matters as might occasion displeasure not only to your Excellency and to the Most Illustrious Don Alfonso, {{but also to the}} duchess and even to himself, has charged us to write to your Excellency to urge you so to contrive that the Lord Giovanni of Pesaro, who, as your Excellency is aware, is in Mantua, shall not be in Ferrara {{at the time of the}} nuptials. Notwithstanding that his divorce from the said duchess is absolutely legitimate and accomplished in accordance with pure truth, as is publicly known not only from the proceedings of the trial but also from the free confession of the said Don Giovanni, it is possible that he may still be actuated by some lingering ill-will; wherefore, should he find himself in any place where the said lady might be seen by him, her Excellency might, in consequence, be compelled to withdraw into privacy, to be spared the memory of the past. Wherefore, his Holiness exhorts your Excellency <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>with</b> your habitual prudence against such a contingency." ...|$|E

Do not {{you know that}} I had {{children}} of my own by a former wife? and of these I have taken so much care as <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>with</b> very handsome fortunes, which are settled irrevocably upon them. I have, Providence be thanked, given each of them £5000, and that is laid in East India stock, sufficient to keep them genteelly, above the frowns of fortune, and free from the fear of want. This, joined to the money I mentioned to you before, as losses at sea, deaths, and bankruptcies, your children's fortunes, which are larger than my own children's, the buying the estate we live on, and several other things, which my receipts and notes will account for, as you may see after my decease. I have, to oblige you on this head, almost descended to particulars, which I never thought to have done; but as I have, rest yourself contented, and be well assured that I have not wilfully thrown any of your substance away." ...|$|E
60|$|Alas! {{what becomes}} {{of the picture}} where men lived {{in the midst of}} plenty, where no man was obliged <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>with</b> anxiety and pain for his restless wants, where the narrow {{principle}} of selfishness did not exist, where Mind was delivered from her perpetual anxiety about corporal support and free to expatiate in the field of thought which is congenial to her. This beautiful fabric of imagination vanishes at the severe touch of truth. The spirit of benevolence, cherished and invigorated by plenty, is repressed by the chilling breath of want. The hateful passions that had vanished reappear. The mighty law of self-preservation expels all the softer and more exalted emotions of the soul. The temptations to evil are too strong for human nature to resist. The corn is plucked before it is ripe, or secreted in unfair proportions, and the whole black train of vices that belong to falsehood are immediately generated. Provisions no longer flow in for the support of the mother with a large family. The children are sickly from insufficient food. The rosy flush of health gives place to the pallid cheek and hollow eye of misery. Benevolence, yet lingering in a few bosoms, makes some faint expiring struggles, till at length self-love resumes his wonted empire and lords it triumphant over the world.|$|E

And at her marriage Ayala would be present, whereas with Ayala's Lucy would have no personal concern. Though she did think that Uncle Tom had been worse than any Vandal in that matter of selling her lover's magnificent works, still {{she was ready to}} tell of his generosity. In a manner of his own he had sent the money which Hamel had so greatly needed, and had now come forward <b>to</b> <b>provide,</b> <b>with</b> a generous hand, for the immediate necessities, and more than the necessities, of the wedding. It was not only that she was to share the honours of the two wedding-cakes with Gertrude, and that she was to be taken as a bride from the gorgeous mansion in Queen's Gate, but that he had provided for her bridal needs almost as fully as for those of his own daughter. [...] "Never mind what she'll be able to do afterwards," [...] he said to his wife, who ventured on some slight remonstrance with him as to the unnecessary luxuries he was preparing for the wife of a poor man. [...] "She won't be the worse for having a dozen new petticoats in her trunk, and, if she don't want to blow her nose with as many handkerchiefs this year as Gertrude does, she'll be able to keep them for next year." [...] Then Aunt Emmeline obeyed without further hesitation the orders which were given her.|$|E
