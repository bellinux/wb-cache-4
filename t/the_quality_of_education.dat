By 2007, the commune had 11 primary schools with 689 students (45percent {{of whom were}} girls) and 28 teachers, but no secondary school. Only three schools had desks.

5|$|Many academics, {{including}} William Holdsworth, a man {{considered to}} be one of the best legal academics in history, maintain that this period saw a decline in the standard of teaching at all the Inns. From 1640 onwards no readings were held, and barristers such as Sir Edward Coke remarked at the time that <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> at the Inns of Court had decreased. Holdsworth put this down to three things—the introduction of printed books, the disinclination of students to attend moots and readings and the disinclination of the Benchers and Readers to enforce attendance.|$|E

Children were kept from schools and, in some cases, hidden from government officials tasked with rounding up children on reserves.

Demands for answers in regards to claims of abuse were often dismissed as a ploy by parents seeking to keep their children at home, with government and school officials positioned as those who knew best.|$|E

5|$|In 1872, Thompson {{was elected}} {{president}} of Otterbein University, and remained in that position until 1886. He received a doctorate in divinity from Otterbein the following year. As president, Thompson continued to teach and delivered speeches around the country on school or church business. Thompson took office shortly before the financial Panic of 1873, with the result that his primary concern as president was keeping the college funded. In this he was successful, although the college had to borrow money to stay afloat until the economy recovered. After the initial debt was incurred, Thompson worked to raise donations to pay it off more quickly. He also worked to attract new professors to teach at Otterbein, improving both <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> and the school's reputation among scholars. Thompson was involved in organizing the General Board of Education of the United Brethren Church, which served as a coordinating body for the schools affiliated with the church.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Nursing)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The {{number of}} {{doctoral}} programmes in nursing has rapidly multiplied {{in many countries}} of the world, with each doctoral programme varying not only between countries, but also between higher education institutions within countries. This {{has led to a}} concern about <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> doctoral <b>education</b> in nursing and <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> criteria, standards and indicators (QCSI) for doctoral education in nursing that can be applied globally. This study is part of an international collaborative study to compare <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> doctoral <b>education</b> in nursing among Australia, Japan, Korea, South Africa, Thailand, United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA) using the QCSI criteria, i. e. the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mission, <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> academic personnel, doctoral students, curriculum, programme administration and infrastructure, the availability of institutional resources and evaluation of the programme. In South Africa, no study has ever been conducted at a national level to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> doctoral <b>education</b> in nursing. Linking to the global need, this research aimed to explore and describe <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> doctoral <b>education</b> in nursing in South Africa and to develop a strategy to improve <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> doctoral <b>education</b> in nursing in South Africa. The aim was achieved through five objectives: exploring and describing <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> doctoral <b>education</b> in nursing in South Africa from the perspectives of nursing deans, academic personnel, doctoral graduates and doctoral students with regard to the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mission, <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> academic personnel, doctoral students, curriculum, programme administration and infrastructure, availability of institutional resources, and evaluation of the programme. A further objective was to develop a strategy to improve <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> doctoral <b>education</b> in nursing in South Africa. The design of the study was quantitative, with exploratory, descriptive and contextual research strategies. The research followed specific steps that consisted of two phases. Phase one consisted of the first four objectives of the study and entailed a comprehensive literature review and empirical research using four structured (Likert-type) internet-mediated (by v email) questionnaires to explore and describe <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> doctoral <b>education</b> in nursing in South Africa from the perspectives of nursing deans, academic personnel, doctoral graduates and doctoral students. Sixty-two (62) problems were identified from the literature review and the empirical research, which served as the evidence base towards developing a strategy for improving <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> doctoral <b>education</b> in nursing in South Africa in phase two, which consisted of objective five of the study. The strategy for improving <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> doctoral <b>education</b> in nursing in South Africa was developed using a strategic process to develop a vision, mission, values, principles, assumptions, strategy objectives, and functional tactics, based on Total Quality Management (TQM) philosophy_ Finally, the research was evaluated, limitations were identified and recommendations were formulated for practice, education, research and policy.
