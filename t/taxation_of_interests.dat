40|$|The residence-based <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> {{income in}} the EU faces the {{difficulty}} that taxpayers may evade taxation by holding bank accounts in other countries. The EU therefore makes considerable efforts to achieve cooperation among EU member states {{in order to improve}} tax enforcement. The present paper argues that international cooperation in tax enforcement may not be sufficient to implement an effective <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> income. The reason is that taxpayers may also avoid income taxes by holding financial assets in the corporate sector. If corporate tax competition reduces corporate income tax rates below personal income tax rates, taxpayers will increasingly shift income from the personal to the corporate sphere. We show that this type of income shifting is empirically important. According to our results, a one percentage point increase in the personal income tax rate increases the fraction of private savings held within corporations by approximately 2. 6 percentage points. ...|$|R

The paper illustrates the Atkinson Stiglitz argument using the simple case where investments produce risk-free returns and individuals vary by their ability. It then considers more complex cases, such as risky returns, inherited wealth, heterogeneous savings rates, {{and the possibility of}} additional returns to savings, such as power, prestige, and security.

The conclusions advanced are that to sustain economic growth, developing countries should adopt residency-based taxation for financial transactions, which would allow the developing country to attract foreign investors. In particular, the benefits for the developing country would be: (i) allowing domestic companies to raise capital by issuing bonds or stock to foreign investors, for lower finance costs; (ii) allowing domestic companies access to the global derivatives markets, which will enhance their risk management activity; and (iii) allowing nonresidents more access to the domestic capital markets, which would enhance the efficiency and liquidity of the markets...|$|R

50|$|Large revenue losses {{associated}} with {{the oil and gas}} tax preferences compared to federal deficit cuts, the oil embargo of 1973, and the Iranian Revolution from 1978-1979 led to a shift in energy policy to alternative energy and conservation. The first major change was the reduction of IDCs and percent depletion for the oil and gas companies. The second change was the implementation of the Energy Tax Act of 1978 which started taxing cars with sub par fuel economy. New energy tax credits were also placed. Examples include investment in conservation or alternative fuels technologies, such as synthetic fuels, solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass. There was also tax credits for production of alcohol fuels, percentage depletion for geothermal deposits, and exempting facilities that turned solid waste into fuel from federal <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|R
40|$|Considering {{the extent}} to which {{progress}} is being made with the integration of the European Capital Market, harmonisation <b>of</b> the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> income is becoming increasingly important. Efficient allocation of capital must not be hindered by inter-governmental tax differentials. Following more than forty years of discussion, the approach that is now beginning to emerge is one by which the principle of country of residence is translated into reality via a system of information exchange and tax collected at source. The information model should guarantee that interest income earned abroad is declared in the taxpayer's country of residence. EU states that place great value on banking secrecy should be able to charge tax collected at source for interest income earned there during a transition phase ending in 2002. Their tax rates must be raised from 15 % to 35 % during this period in order to stimulate the transition to information exchange in these countries as well. In this context, Switzerland and other third countries, which are supposed to give up their status as tax havens and adopt this approach, represent a particular problem relating to tax policy. The model chosen for the EU is a pragmatic concession in so far as its intervention in national tax law is relatively limited. With its interest income tax rate of 25 %, which is to apply to interest income earned by resident taxpayers from 2004 onwards, German tax legislation has opted for an approach that would be compatible with the European solution if, while implementing the European approach, information about interest income earned in Germany by non-resident individuals could also be passed on. Both the standards negotiated for a European guideline on the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> income and the German approach are incomplete in as far as there remain considerable gaps in the recording of impersonal and personal tax liability. Further efforts need to be made as regards tax policy in order to eliminate the remaining deficiencies in the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> income and bring about coordination between the burden <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> income and the likewise necessary harmonisation of corporate management {{in a way that makes}} sense economically.

Ronald McKinnon describes some of the services performed by the market and distinguishes between money and credit. The distinction is elementary, but important because it is often neglected.

Dale Henderson and Douglas Waldo analyze the effect of putting reserve requirements on Euro-dollars. They show that, in a model with a single rate <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and fixed exchange rates, reserve requirements on Euro-dollars reduce the variance of the money stock — demand deposits and currency — around its target value. With fluctuating exchange rates, the result is ambiguous.
