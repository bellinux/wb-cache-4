5|$|As the Great War progressed, war {{exhaustion}} in Germany grew. The first {{strikes in}} the country {{since the start of}} the war broke out in 1915, steadily increasing in frequency and magnitude. The unions' role as <b>troubleshooter</b> between the employers and the workers soon led to conflict between the membership and union officials, and the Free Trade Unions steadily lost members. Correspondingly, the Reichstag faction of the SPD split over continued support for the war. The 1917 February Revolution in Russia was seen by the FVdG as an expression of the people's desire for peace. The syndicalists paid special attention to the role the general strike (which they had been advocating for years) played in the revolution. They were unable to comment on the October Revolution as the Rundschreiben had been banned by the time it broke out.|$|E

25|$|The same year, Ryan {{was cast}} in the action thriller Proof of Life with Russell Crowe, {{directed}} by Taylor Hackford. In the film, she portrayed the distraught wife of a kidnapped engineer, played by David Morse, while relying on a resourceful <b>troubleshooter</b> who makes a profession of dealing with international bandits. While the film became a lukewarm critical and commercial success, grossing $63million worldwide, it garnered much reportage in the tabloid press in association with Ryan and Crowe's affair. Stephen Holden, film critic for The New York Times, did not think the film worked well and opined that the actors did not connect.|$|E

25|$|Swindon Town F.C. {{was also}} {{scheduled}} to appear {{as part of the}} Sky TV series Big Ron Manager in 2006, which involved former football manager Ron Atkinson acting as a <b>troubleshooter</b> for a club in difficulties. Filming began in December 2005 at the County Ground, with caretaker-manager Iffy Onuora in charge of Swindon at the time. The appearance of Atkinson at the club resulted in widespread press speculation {{that he was going to}} take over the management of the team, which was denied. Following the disruption caused by this and the producers' wish for more backroom access, the television crew were asked to leave the club's premises in January 2006.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Varney's fellow Paranoia writer, Mongoose Publishing {{employee}} Gareth Hanrahan, {{took over}} as primary writer for the Paranoia line. During the lifetime of the XP line Mongoose released numerous supplements and adventures for the game. Notable amongst the supplements was Extreme Paranoia, which provided ideas for scenarios based around characters of security clearances Orange to Violet, with premises differing greatly from the standard Red-clearance <b>Troubleshooter</b> concept but remaining thematically appropriate to the game's setting and atmosphere. (This included an updated reprint of the 1st Edition supplement HIL Sector Blues, which focused on playing Blue-clearance IntSec agents.) The idea of devising new and varied concepts to base Paranoia adventures and campaigns around would be revisited for the next edition of the game.|$|E
25|$|The show follows {{secret agent}} Angus MacGyver, played by Richard Dean Anderson, {{who works as}} a <b>troubleshooter</b> for the fictional Phoenix Foundation in Los Angeles and as an agent for a fictional United States {{government}} agency, the Department of External Services (DXS). Educated as a scientist in Physics at Western Tech ("Hell Week"), MacGyver served in the U.S. Army Special Forces as a Bomb Team Technician/EOD during the Vietnam War ("Countdown"). Resourceful and possessing an encyclopedic knowledge of the physical sciences, he solves complex problems by making things out of ordinary objects, along with his ever-present Swiss Army knife, duct tape, and occasionally matches. He favors non-violent resolutions and prefers not to handle a gun due to a gun death of one of his friends in his teenage years.|$|E

25|$|From May 1942 until April 1946, {{he served}} as the first Naval Inspector General. The Naval Inspector General {{was used as a}} <b>troubleshooter</b> during World War II, {{inspecting}} shore facilities and investigating misconduct. As but one of 24 inspection authorities concerned with Navy procurement and administration of activities ashore, he was instructed to keep the organization small and to rely on augmentation from the Fleet. He retired in August 1943 upon reaching the statutory age, and was advanced to admiral on the retired list as the highest rank in which he had served, but remained on active duty as inspector general {{until the end of the}} war. In early 1946, he investigated the sinking of the heavy cruiser Indianapolis in his official capacity as inspector general, but agreed to curtail his investigation so that Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King and Navy Secretary James V. Forrestal could immediately court-martial Indianapolis commanding officer, Captain Charles B. McVay III.|$|E
25|$|Joffe {{was one of}} the Soviet delegates at the Genoa Conference in February 1922, an {{experience}} he described in a short book published later that same year. After the Soviet walkout, he was made ambassador to China, as the Soviet <b>troubleshooter</b> (or Kuznetsov) of those days. In 1923, Joffe signed an agreement with Sun Yat-Sen in Shanghai on aid to Kuomintang {{on the assumption that the}} latter would cooperate with Chinese Communists, presumably with Lenin's approval. While in China, Joffe traveled to Japan in June 1923 to settle Soviet-Japanese relations. The negotiations proved long and difficult and were aborted when Joffe became gravely ill and had to be sent back to Moscow. After a partial recovery, he served as a member of the Soviet delegation to Great Britain in 1924 and as Soviet representative in Austria in 1924–1926. In 1926 his declining health and disagreements with the ruling Bolshevik faction forced his semi-retirement. He tried to concentrate on teaching, but it also proved difficult due to his illness.|$|E
500|$|After Warren Spector {{released}} [...] with Origin Systems in January 1993, {{he began}} to plan <b>Troubleshooter,</b> the game that would become Deus Ex. Noting his wife's fascination with The X-Files, he connected the [...] "real world, millennial weirdness, [...] conspiracy stuff" [...] topics on his mind and {{decided to make a}} game about it that would appeal to a wider audience. He also considered cyberpunk influences that came from around 1978 when he was participating in a themed Dungeons & Dragons campaign created and led by Bruce Sterling, who had adapted that campaign based on the choice Spector and the other players made. <b>Troubleshooter,</b> in contrast to the other games he had been making at Origin, would have been a [...] "real-world role-playing game", relying more on player choices and assuring that every player could reach {{the end of the game}} but in the manner they choose.|$|E

500|$|After Looking Glass Technologies and Origin Systems {{released}} [...] in January 1993, producer Warren Spector {{began to}} plan <b>Troubleshooter,</b> {{the game that}} would become Deus Ex. Spector found himself burnt out on fantasy and science fiction settings and hoped to make a game set in the real world. In his 1994 proposal, he described the concept as [...] "Underworld-style first-person action" [...] in a real world setting with [...] "big-budget, nonstop action". Spector later commented that Origin {{did not have the}} interest, nor Looking Glass the funding, to produce the game. He eventually left Origin for Looking Glass and continued to develop the game's concept, but his project Junction Point, which was inspired by ideas from <b>Troubleshooter,</b> was canceled. After Spector and his team were laid off from Looking Glass, John Romero of Ion Storm offered him the chance to make his [...] "dream game" [...] without any restrictions. Spector quickly joined the company.|$|E
500|$|When Taft {{took office}} as Secretary of War in January 1904, {{he was not}} called upon to spend much time {{administering}} the army, which the president was content to do himself—Roosevelt wanted Taft as a <b>troubleshooter</b> in difficult situations, as a legal adviser, {{and to be able}} to give campaign speeches as he sought election in his own right. Taft strongly defended Roosevelt's record in his addresses, and wrote of the president's successful but strenuous efforts to gain election, [...] "I would not run for president if you guaranteed the office. It is awful to be afraid of one's shadow." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{versions of}} Windows, Windows Update {{does not allow}} the selective installation of updates, and all updates (including patches, feature updates, and driver software) are downloaded and installed automatically. Users can only choose whether their system will reboot automatically to install updates when the system is inactive, or be notified to schedule a reboot. If a wireless network is designated as [...] "Metered"—a function which automatically reduces the operating system's background network activity to conserve limits on internet usage, most updates are not downloaded until the device is connected to a non-metered network. Redstone 2 allows wired (Ethernet) networks to be designated as metered, but Windows may still download certain updates while connected to a metered network. Updates can cause compatibility or other problems; a Microsoft <b>troubleshooter</b> program allows bad updates to be uninstalled.|$|E

500|$|Kennedy's {{personal}} life came to dominate his image. In 1989 paparazzi stalked {{him on a}} vacation in Europe and photographed him having sex on a motorboat. In February 1990, Michael Kelly published his long, thorough profile [...] "Ted Kennedy on the Rocks" [...] in GQ magazine. It captured Kennedy as [...] "an aging Irish boyo clutching a bottle and diddling a blonde," [...] portrayed him as an out-of-control Regency rake, and brought his behavior {{to the forefront of}} public attention. The death from cancer of brother-in-law Stephen Edward Smith in August 1990 left Kennedy emotionally bereft at the loss of a close family member and <b>troubleshooter.</b> Kennedy pushed on, but even his legislative successes, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which expanded employee rights in discrimination cases, came at the cost of being criticized for compromising with Republicans and Southern Democrats.|$|E
500|$|The two Harding cabinet appointees who darkened the {{reputation}} of his administration for their involvement in scandal were Harding's Senate friend, Albert B. Fall of New Mexico, the Interior Secretary, and Daugherty, who became Attorney General. Fall was a Western rancher and former miner, and was pro-development. He was opposed by conservationists such as Gifford Pinchot, who wrote, [...] "it {{would have been possible}} to pick a worse man for Secretary of the Interior, but not altogether easy". The New York Times mocked the Daugherty appointment, stating that rather than select one of the best minds, Harding had been content [...] "to choose merely a best friend". Eugene P. Trani and David L. Wilson, in their volume on Harding's presidency, suggest that the appointment made sense then, since Daugherty was [...] "a competent lawyer well-acquainted with the seamy side of politics... a first-class political <b>troubleshooter</b> and someone Harding could trust".|$|E
500|$|In his 1994 {{proposal}} to Origin, {{he described the}} concept as [...] "Underworld-style first-person action" [...] in a real world setting with [...] "big-budget, nonstop action" [...] starring an ex-cop [...] "security specialist". He described the project as [...] "high" [...] risk for its [...] "technological unknowns" [...] as [...] "probably the toughest project on his wish list". It failed to get to production. He later left Origin for Looking Glass Technologies near {{the time that they}} were producing , but kept the idea in mind. For Thief, he tried to suggest buffing the character more so that the player could opt to fight through levels instead of sneaking, the original intent of the game, but the team didn't take to these ideas. He continued to change his character and game system plans for <b>Troubleshooter,</b> though the game he then called Junction Point did not reach production at Looking Glass. Spector wrote that the timing was not yet ripe because the business teams were not interested, the technology was not yet feasible, he did not have an interested team or the resources to make one, and that publishers did not want a [...] "first-person, cross-genre game". Spector, himself, was also tired of unrealistic fantasy and alien settings. Frustrated at Looking Glass, Spector sought employment elsewhere and was nearly about to sign a contract with Electronic Arts, when John Romero of Ion Storm approached him. When Romero offered him a chance to make his [...] "dream game" [...] without any restrictions, Spector was immediately on board.|$|E
