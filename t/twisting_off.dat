In 1895, the Caledonia was overhauled and lengthened at Bonser's request, making her more maneuverable. Bonser named eleven of the canyons and rapids on the Skeena River, using {{the character of the}} obstacle as a guide.

Among them were the Whirly Gig Rapids, Hornet’s Nest Rapids and the Devil’s Elbow Canyon, where the Skeena rushed directly towards a rock bluff before <b>twisting</b> <b>off</b> to the right. Despite these perils the Caledonia operated for seven seasons until the HBC replaced her with a new sternwheeler in 1898, also named the Caledonia. By this time, the Klondike Gold Rush was in full swing and there was more interest in the north than ever previously. Robert Cunningham had prospered during this period and now owned a cannery and a lumber mill. He decided that a sternwheeler would be a fine addition to his enterprises, and he bought the Monte Cristo and hired Captain Bonser away from the HBC to pilot it. The HBC built a second sternwheeler, the Strathcona, and were little concerned about Cunningham’s rival vessel.|$|E

The worthy Collector had, some years before, come to that gentleman with a written recommendation from the Earl of Clandennie of a very unusual sort. It was the Lieutenant's good-fortune {{to save the life}} of the Honorable Frederick Dunburne, second son of the Earl--a wild, rakish, undisciplined youth, much given to such mischievous enterprises as the <b>twisting</b> <b>off</b> of door-knockers, the beating of the watch, and the carrying away of tavern signs.|$|E

60|$|Now {{if there}} is a thing in the world which calls for the {{exercise}} of man's every faculty it is curlew shooting in a mist. Perhaps he may wait for an hour or even two hours and see nothing, not even an oyster-catcher. Then at last from miles away comes the faint wild call of curlew on the wing. He strains his eyes, the call comes nearer, but nothing can he see. At last, seventy yards or more to the right, he catches sight of the flicker of beating wings, and, like a flash, they are gone. Again a call--the curlew are flighting. He looks and looks, in his excitement struggling to his feet and raising his head incautiously far above the sheltering rock. There they come, a great flock of thirty or more, bearing straight down on him, a hundred yards off--eighty--sixty--now. Up goes the gun, but alas and alas! they {{catch a glimpse of the}} light glinting on the barrels, and perhaps of the head behind them, and in another second they have broken and scattered this way and that way, <b>twisting</b> <b>off</b> like a wisp of gigantic snipe, to vanish with melancholy cries into the depth of mist.|$|E

50|$|Rams {{were thought}} {{to be one of the}} main weapons of war galleys after c. 700 BC, and the Athlit ram's {{construction}} implies advanced technology that was developed over a long period of time. Heavy timbers were shaped and attached to the hull, and then the bronze ram was created to fit around the timbers for added strength. The evidence for this lies in the remnants of timbers found inside the Athlit ram when it was discovered. The blunt edge of the ram and the patterned protrusion were intended to break open the seams of the target ship while at the same time dispersing the force of impact on the attacking ship to prevent the ram from <b>twisting</b> <b>off</b> and damaging the attacking ship. It was also less likely to become stuck in the hull of its target.|$|E
50|$|Lieutenant Commander Francis Asbury Roe of Sassucus, seeing Albemarle at a {{range of}} about 400 yd, decided to ram.

With Sassucuss hull almost touching {{the end of the}} ram's Brooke rifle, Albemarles gun crew quickly fired two point-blank rifled shells, one of them puncturing Sassucuss boilers; though live steam was roaring through the ship, she was able to break away and drift out of range. Miami first tried to use her spar torpedo and then to tangle the Confederate rams screw propellers and rudder with a seine net, but neither ploy succeeded. More than 500 shells were fired at Albemarle during the battle; with visible battle damage to her smokestack and other areas on the ironclad, she steamed back up the Roanoke, soon mooring at Plymouth.|$|E

5000|$|When the Omineca Gold Rush {{began in}} 1869, it became {{profitable}} to attempt navigation on the Skeena again. The Omineca diggings {{could be easily}} reached from Hazelton, where a trail ran for 115 mi, passing Fort Babine and Takla Lake. At first, canoes were used to ship the supplies from the coast. Captain William Moore was under contract with the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) to perform this service, and Robert Cunningham traded as an independent. This was gruelling and perilous work, as well as slow and expensive. The HBC decided in 1889 to build a sternwheeler, the Caledonia, and hired Captain George Odin to be her pilot. She was launched on February 28, 1891, at New Westminster and made her first trip to Hazelton that May, taking nine days to make the trip. The Caledonia was considered a success and began serving not only the Skeena River, but also the northern coastal regions. Captain John Bonser was hired on to be her captain, and in 1895 the Caledonia was overhauled and lengthened at his request, making her more manoeuvrable. Bonser named eleven of the canyons and rapids on the Skeena River, using {{the character of the}} obstacle as a guide. Among them were the Whirly Gig Rapids, Hornet’s Nest Rapids and the Devil’s Elbow Canyon, where the Skeena rushed directly towards a rock bluff before <b>twisting</b> <b>off</b> to the right.

40|$|Mill rolls {{are ones}} {{of the most}} {{expensive}} tools applied in plastic working processes and have to satisfy several criteria, which allow them to be used. Cast iron mill rolls, due to their fracture toughness and tribological properties, are the most often applied at hot-rolling in the last rolling stands. This results from the smallest dynamic loads of such rolling stands and the decisive influence of the surface quality of these tools on the surface quality of the rolled product. An improper microstructure of rolls can lead to their premature wearing, e. g. broken flanges, pivots <b>twisting</b> <b>off</b> etc. By means of the heat treatment the matrix microstructure and morphology of carbide precipitationscan be modified and this in-turn can influence cast iron properties. Determination of the influence of microstructure changes, caused by the heat treatment, on the properties of EN-GJN-HV 300 low-alloycast iron, after its modification and spheroidization – is the aim of the present paper. Those changes are based on the formation pearlitic or bainitic matrices at the similar morphology of graphite and ledeburitic cementite precipitations. The performed investigations should enable designing the heat treatment of cast iron metallurgical rolls {{in such a way as}} to obtain the optimal microstructures for functional parameters of these type of tools. The influence of changing the pearlitic matrix into the bainitic one on such properties as: hardness, impact strength, tensile strength, creep limit, bending strength and a stress intensity factor KIc was investigated in this study. Samples for testing, the listed above mechanical properties, were taken from an industrial casting with care to have pieces of very similar crystallization conditions...|$|E

40|$|Candy sprays are {{a type of}} confectionary sold in pump sprays {{and sprayed}} {{directly}} into the mouth. To achieve a particularly sour taste, candy sprays typically have a high citric acid content. The BfR has assessed the health risks potentially arising from the consumption of such products. The BfR notably regards candy sprays as problematic which are high in citric acid. High citric acid contents can, for example, lead to irritations of the mucous membrane in the mouth and may cause breathing difficulties and damage to teeth. Additionally, the BfR is critical {{of the use of}} such products as a spray, because candy sprays may – either inadvertently or deliberately – be inhaled or sprayed into the eyes. Another potential misuse of is the removal of the spray head for the purpose of drinking the product. The effects of the citric acid on the skin, mucosa, eyes and enamel depend on the acid’s concentration, the pH value of the product, as well as duration and frequency of use. However, {{on the basis of the}} available data, no citric acid content can be defined up to which the acid is safe to use. Given the misuses to be expected and against the background that children are the main user group, the BfR therefore rates the products as an unsafe food overall. In the view of the BfR, options for improving consumer protection include: labelling of products with additional warnings, equipping the packaging with a mechanism that stops consumers screwing or <b>twisting</b> <b>off</b> the spray head, and limiting the content of citric acid approximately to the level contained in lemon juice (i. e. a maximum of 7 %) ...|$|E
