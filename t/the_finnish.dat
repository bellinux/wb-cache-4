5|$|By {{the winter}} of 1939, the Soviets further reduced their demands and sent Boris Stein to negotiate. Stein and Erkko met five times. Erkko {{rejected}} the Soviet proposals, saying that the Soviet demands would {{mean the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>Finnish</b> neutrality policy and displease the Germans. When the chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Finnish</b> Defense Council C.G.E. Mannerheim was informed of the negotiations, he opined that Finland should give up the Suursaari islands because their defence would anyway be impossible during a war, but his arguments did not persuade the majority of <b>the</b> <b>Finnish</b> government. Stein departed Helsinki empty-handed on 6 April.|$|E
5|$|During {{the closing}} stages of World War I, German-trained Finnish Jäger troops {{played a key}} role in <b>the</b> <b>Finnish</b> Civil War, while the German Baltic Sea Division also intervened late in the civil war. Jäger troops were volunteers from German-influenced circles, such as {{university}} students. This participation in <b>the</b> <b>Finnish</b> struggle for independence created close ties with Germany, but after the German defeat in the World War, Scandinavian relations became more important and the main goal of <b>the</b> <b>Finnish</b> foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, the Soviet Union began {{collectivization}} in Ingria.

5|$|Later, <b>the</b> <b>Finnish</b> statesman J.K.

The invasion was judged as illegal by the League of Nations, which expelled the Soviet Union on December 14. Following the Soviet attack, C.G.E.

Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>Finnish</b> government changed as Risto Ryti was appointed {{the new prime minister}} and Väinö Tanner as foreign minister.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Finnish</b> labor movement, {{which emerged}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century from temperance, {{religious}} movements and Fennomania, had a Finnish nationalist, working-class character. From 1899–1906 the movement became conclusively independent, shedding the patronizing thinking of the Fennoman estates, and it was represented by <b>the</b> <b>Finnish</b> Social Democratic Party, established in 1899. Workers' activism directed both toward opposing Russification and in developing a domestic policy that tackled social problems and responded to the demand for democracy. This was a reaction to the domestic dispute, ongoing since the 1880s, between <b>the</b> <b>Finnish</b> nobility-burghers and the labor movement concerning voting rights for the common people.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet offer divided <b>the</b> <b>Finnish</b> government.

5|$|As Finnish {{nationalism}} arose {{and increased}} in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, crossbreeding of <b>the</b> <b>Finnish</b> horse essentially ended and a new direction was taken by Finnish horse breeders. The breed was considered {{a symbol of the}} nation, and thus it was desired that it be as purebred as possible. On 20 November 1894, Finland's first horse breeding association Hevoskasvatusyhdistys Hippos (now Suomen Hippos) was founded to breed and improve <b>the</b> <b>Finnish</b> horse by the means of purebreeding, and in 1905, a governmental decree was issued for horse breeding associations to be founded throughout the country, leading to the establishment of the Finnhorse stud book in 1907.|$|E

5|$|Besides their {{obligations}} as obedient, peaceful and nonpolitical {{inhabitants of the}} Grand Duchy, who had a few decades earlier accepted the class system as {{the natural order of}} their life, the commoners began to ask for and demand their civil rights and citizenship in Finnish society. The power struggle between <b>the</b> <b>Finnish</b> estates and the Russian administration gave a concrete role model and free space for the labor movement. On the other side, due to at least a century-long tradition and experience of administrative leadership, <b>the</b> <b>Finnish</b> elite saw itself as the inherent natural power.|$|E
5|$|Finally, on 30 October, the new long-planned {{offensive}} began, {{and after}} two days a Soviet regiment was encircled. Finnish General Hjalmar Siilasvuo proceeded to clear the perimeter with his troops. After the disappointing performance of the SS units under his command and the realization that he neither <b>the</b> <b>Finnish</b> nor the German high command is going to provide him with additional forces or substantial reinforcements, he slowed down the advance towards the east and instead concentrated on clearing and securing the area. Those mop-up operations were completed by 13 November. By that point <b>the</b> <b>Finnish</b> 3rd Division had killed 3,000 Soviet soldiers and captured 2,600.|$|E

5|$|Finland {{was divided}} into two {{operational}} zones. Northern Finland was the staging area for Army Norway. Its goal was to execute a two-pronged pincer movement on the strategic port of Murmansk, named Operation Silver Fox. Southern Finland was still under the responsibility of <b>the</b> <b>Finnish</b> Army.

5|$|In August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany {{signed the}} Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, in which Eastern European {{countries}} {{were divided into}} spheres of interest; Finland belonged to the Soviet sphere of interest. In October 1939, Stalin gained control of the Baltic states and turned his sights on Finland, confident that control could be gained without great effort. The Soviet Union demanded territories on the Karelian Isthmus, the islands of the Gulf of Finland and a military base near <b>the</b> <b>Finnish</b> capital Helsinki, similar to the demands presented in the previous years. The Finns again refused, and the Red Army attacked on 30 November 1939.
