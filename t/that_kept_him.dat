Bush ran for 121yards and three touchdowns against Connecticut, his first game back from the injury. Heading into the Gator Bowl, Bush earned a school-record 24touchdowns and led the country in scoring. He ran for 1,049yards in nine games. He was also a capable receiver, catching 20passes for 245yards and a touchdown. But with Brohm on the sidelines, it was expected the Cardinals would rely on Bush's legs more than usual, {{in an effort to}} minimize the need for the inexperienced Cantwell to pass the ball.|$|E

5|$|Among the {{perquisites}} of the Times appointment were {{a company}} {{car and a}} large and splendid office at the paper's building in Printing House Square, London. Levin accepted neither; he could not drive and he hated to be isolated. He commandeered a desk in the anteroom to the editor's office, a location <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> closely {{in touch with the}} daily affairs of the paper. It also gave him ready access to the editor, William Rees Mogg, with whom he developed a good friendship. Levin's brief was to write two columns a week (later three) on any subject that he wished. His range was prodigious; he published nine volumes of his selected journalism of which the first, Taking Sides, covered subjects as diverse as the death watch beetle, Field Marshal Montgomery, Wagner, homophobia, censorship, Eldridge Cleaver, arachniphobia, theatrical nudity, and the North Thames Gas Board.|$|E

Recording three points over 11 games against the Blackhawks and Nashville Predators in the first two rounds, he was demoted at one point to the Canucks' fourth line in the second round against Nashville; it was suspected he was playing through an injury. In Game 5 of the second round against Nashville, he fell to the ice while stretching to retrieve a loose puck and needed to be helped off the ice. Twelve days later, on May 19, he underwent surgery for his adductor tendon and a sports hernia, sidelining him for the remainder of the playoffs.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Tasci {{attracted}} interest from clubs around Europe. Stuttgart's league rival Hamburger SV as well as foreign clubs such as Tottenham Hotspur and Juventus reportedly expressed their desire to sign him. This move was denied by his agent; he said that Tasci would stay at Stuttgart only. On 15 July 2010, Tasci expressed his desire to stay at the club. After being excluded from the opening game of the season, he made his first appearance in a 3–2 loss against Borussia Dortmund.

He continued to attract interest from Zenit Saint Petersburg, Tottenham, Málaga and Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Westley signed a three-year {{contract}} extension at Stevenage <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> contracted to the club until 2014. Westley acquired five players on free transfers, while also releasing five of the existing squad. Stevenage started their first ever League One campaign well, beating the 2010–11 League One play-off semi-finalists, Bournemouth, 3–1 at Dean Court to secure their first victory of the season on 16 August 2011. Stevenage were exceeding expectations in the third tier of English football, sitting just outside the play-off places after securing a notable 5–1 victory against Sheffield Wednesday Broadhall Way in September 2011. The club also inflicted Charlton Athletic's first league defeat of the season after a 1–0 win against the league leaders. The victory against Charlton was to spark a 13-game unbeaten run for Westley's Stevenage, and a 6–1 away victory at Colchester United on Boxing Day 2011 meant the club were sat in sixth place, the final play-off position. After managing Stevenage for three-and-a-half years, Westley left Stevenage in January 2012, joining fellow League One side Preston North End. His final game as manager of Stevenage was a 1–0 away victory at Reading in the FA Cup Third Round.|$|E

During the 2010–11 season, Hooper had the best strike rate of any player in Britain, scoring 20 goals in 26 matches with a strike rate of 0.77 goals per match.

5|$|Byrom {{started in}} Stevenage's first ever Football League game, a 2–2 home draw against Macclesfield Town. He played in Stevenage's {{televised}} League Cup loss {{two days later}} against Championship side Portsmouth. The following week, Byrom gave away a penalty in a 1–0 defeat at Bradford City, which Gareth Evans converted to score the only goal of the game. After playing the whole game in Stevenage's 1–0 defeat at Cheltenham Town in September 2010, Byrom suffered a number of injuries <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> out of the first-team for five months. He returned to first-team action in February 2011, coming on as an 89th-minute substitute in a 3–0 loss at Bury. Four days later, he started in a 1–0 defeat at Shrewsbury Town. He was an unused substitute for Stevenage's next five league matches, before starting in the club's 3–3 home draw with Bury {{on the final day}} of the 2010–11 season – playing a key role in two of Stevenage's goals to ensure the club reached the play-offs. Byrom scored his first goal of the season in Stevenage's 2–0 home win against Accrington Stanley in the play-off semi-final first leg, reaching the ball before Accrington goalkeeper Alex Cisak to double Stevenage's lead. He played the whole game in the second leg, a 1–0 victory that ensured Stevenage made the play-off final. Byrom started in the final, a 1–0 victory against Torquay United at Old Trafford, a win that meant Stevenage earned back-to-back promotions to League One. Despite ending the season on a positive note, Byrom made just 12 appearances, scoring once, due to a host of injuries interrupting his campaign.|$|E
