25|$|It {{should be}} noted that {{according}} to the statutory accounting rules for title insurance, only reported claims are reflected in the loss expense, while in other lines—both reported and unreported claims are included in the loss expense. As a result, timing differences occur in the reporting of losses and loss-adjustment expenses for title insurance when compared to other lines. In addition, title insurance, unlike most other property/casualty exposures, has no termination date and no <b>time</b> <b>limitation</b> on filing claims.|$|E
25|$|After the {{founding}} and development years {{as well as}} its conversion into a joint-stock company, VP Bank’s size and profitability grew significantly between 1963 and 1969. By 1969 its total assets stood at CHF 150 million, while revenues continued to rise during that period and client assets under management had increased from 19 million to 134 million Swiss francs. That growth was attributable to the fact that, since 1963, the bank was allowed to conduct all banking activities not subject to official rules and regulations. In December 1967, parliament abrogated the contingency of the banking concession on the founder and hence the related <b>time</b> <b>limitation</b> for VP Bank. In return, VP Bank committed to keeping at all times a minimum of 60 per cent of its voting rights and 51 per cent of its share capital legally and beneficially in the hands of Liechtenstein citizens.|$|E

In June 1966, a Silver Star arrived in Bouck's mailbox, {{but no other}} platoon member was recognized. Bouck was shortly afterward interviewed by John S. D. Eisenhower for his book The Bitter Woods, which described {{the actions of the}} unit in detail. Columnist Jack Anderson unsuccessfully campaigned for William James (Tsakanikas) to be awarded the Medal of Honor. Congressional hearings on the men's action resulted in a recommendation to the Secretary of Defense that Bill James be awarded the Medal of Honor. The U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force concurred, but the Marine Corps responded that James failed to show sufficient [...] "intrepidity". The hearings also resulted in Public Law 96-145, which waived the <b>time</b> <b>limitation</b> exclusively for members of the platoon.

2500|$|In January 1938, Milt Gabler started {{recording}} {{for his new}} label, Commodore Records, and {{to allow}} for longer continuous performances, he recorded some 12-inch records. Eddie Condon explained: [...] "Gabler realized that a jam session needs room for development." [...] The first two 12-inch recordings did {{not take advantage of}} the extra length: [...] "Carnegie Drag" [...] was 3m15s; [...] "Carnegie Jump", 2m41s. But at the second session, on April 30, the two 12-inch recordings were longer: [...] "Embraceable You" [...] was 4m05s; [...] "Serenade to a Shylock", 4m32s. Another way around the <b>time</b> <b>limitation</b> was to issue a selection on both sides of a single record. Vaudeville stars Gallagher and Shean recorded [...] "Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean", written by Irving and Jack Kaufman, as two sides of a 10-inch 78 in 1922 for Cameo. An obvious workaround for longer recordings was to release a set of records. An early multi-record release was in 1903, when HMV in England made the first complete recording of an opera, Verdi's Ernani, on 40 single-sided discs. In 1940, Commodore released Eddie Condon and his Band's recording of [...] "A Good Man Is Hard to Find" [...] in four parts, issued on both sides of two 12-inch 78s. This limitation on the duration of recordings persisted from 1910 until the invention of the LP record, in 1948. In popular music, this <b>time</b> <b>limitation</b> of about [...] minutes on a 10-inch 78rpm record meant that singers usually did not release long pieces on record. One exception is Frank Sinatra's recording of Rodgers and Hammerstein's [...] "Soliloquy", from Carousel, made on May 28, 1946. Because it ran 7m57s, longer than both sides of a standard 78rpm 10-inch record, it was released on Columbia's Masterwork label (the classical division) as two sides of a 12-inch record. The same was true of John Raitt's performance of the song on the original cast album of Carousel, which had been issued on a 78-rpm album set by American Decca in 1945.|$|E
