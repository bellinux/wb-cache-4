Major David Bates Douglass was appointed to perform engineering studies on the future Old Croton Aqueduct in March 1833. Douglass made estimates for the new aqueduct in 1833–1834 and John Martineau performed a separate study in 1834. Both found the proposed route, which ran through the present-day park, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>okay.</b> Thus, in 1837, construction started on the Aqueduct, which ran [...] from the Croton River upstate to the New York Public Library Main Branch and Bryant Park in midtown Manhattan. The project was built by 3–4 thousand laborers who completed the entire aqueduct in five years. The aqueduct's builders constructed a gatehouse. within the present-day park to provide access to the aqueduct's interior. The old aqueduct was supplemented by the New Croton Aqueduct in 1890, which also ran through the park. The Old Croton Aqueduct was in use until 1955, though the part that ran through the park was closed down in 1897 after the new aqueduct was connected to the Jerome Park Reservoir.|$|E

Prowse also auditioned for Non. Reeve went from 188 to 212 pounds during pre-production and filming. Reeve was paid a mere $250,000 for both Superman and Superman II, while his veteran co-stars received huge sums of money: $3.7 million for Brando and $2 million for Hackman for Superman I. However, Reeve felt, [...] "'Superman' brought me many opportunities, rather than closing a door in my face." [...] Jeff East portrays teenage Clark Kent. East's lines were overdubbed by Reeve during post-production. [...] "I was not happy about it because the producers never told me what they had in mind," [...] East commented.

[...] Its concept focuses largely on the demise of her marriage to René Elizondo, Jr. and subsequent embrace of the single life, experiencing dating for the first time. It also contains themes of sensuality, deceit, and betrayal. Jackson said, [...] "It’s a different thing for me. Growing up, I never dated. I’m doing that now, experiencing that whole life." [...] Its upbeat tempo intended to reflect Jackson's self-esteem, described as [...] "a work in progress." [...] Jam commented, [...] "She doesn't see herself the way other people see her. You know...gorgeous and sexy and all that. That isn't the kind of person she is. Although she is closer to feeling like that person now than she was 15 years ago. Or even three of four years ago." [...] Jackson commented, [...] "I look back at pictures of myself from four years ago and I see the unhappiness in my eyes. But I'm in the greatest space now...

[...] The mixtape's second track [...] "We Get By" [...] is mainly of an old school R/pop genre. It is written by JoJo who expresses remaining optimistic in spite of the obstacles she faces. [...] "I know it will be OK. I believe in myself" [...] she sings, referring to her constant label troubles. JoJo states [...] "It's kind of about me moving from South Boston to Los Angeles and my decision to do that. Feeling like I needed a place to explore and grow." [...] She goes on further in another interview stating [...] "It's the mission statement for {{what we were going to}} expand upon, and I was touching on the feeling like you don't belong anywhere but you still feel like you're going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>okay</b> no matter where you're at." [...] The third track on the tape [...] "Take the Canyon" [...] is influenced by an old relationship. JoJo says [...] "'Take the Canyon' is about cheating, and it's about only having a window of time to be with that lover and needing to get there as soon as possible for this illicit rendezvous. It's about taking the canyon–Beverly Glen or Laurel Canyon or whatever it may be." [...] The fourth track is titled [...] "Billions" [...] and was originally written about an old lover.

2500|$|In {{the opening}} match second {{generation}} luchador Stigma. with his chest painted to resemble The Incredible Hulk, {{teamed up with}} the Distrito Federal Welterweight Championship Sensei {{to take on the}} rudo ("Bad guys") team of Bobby Zavala and Cholo. Stigma got the third and deciding fall for his team, in what was described as a [...] "memorable" [...] performance. The second match of the night was originally booked to have Mini-Estrella Astral team up Fantasy and Último Dragóncito, but on the prior Tuesday Astral got badly hurt during an Infierno en el Ring Steel cage match. Astral was the sixth person to exit the cage when he tried to perform a Moonsault of the top of the cage onto Mercurio, Aéreo and Fantasy who were on the floor. Due to the cage mesh breaking earlier in the match, Astral got caught up on the cage and landed awkwardly on the three men on the floor. The bad fall caused Astral to be rushed out of the arena for immediate attention and Mercurio had to be carried to the back as well due to the impact of Astral. Due to the injuries sustained he was replaced by Acero. The rudo team, , Pequeño Olímpico and Pierrothito, had all suffered various injuries during the same match but seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>okay</b> on Friday night. The rudo trio consisted of the reigning CMLL World Mini-Estrella Champion (Olímpico), the reigning Mexican National Lightweight Champion (Pierrothito) {{and one of the most}} experienced Mini-Estrellas in the division, an advantage that was evident as the team won both the first and the last fall of the match, taking the last fall by submission as Pierrothito forced Dragoncito to give up. The Lightning Match (10 minute time limit and only one fall as opposed to the traditional three fall matches CMLL prefers) featured the experienced rudo Sangre Azteca take on the high flying Fuego, who was one half of the CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship team with Stuka, Jr.. Neither wrestler dominated the match, but Sangre Azteca took the victory in five minutes, thirty seconds when he countered Fuego's move off the top rope with a dropkick followed by a pinfall. CMLL introduced Puma King as simply [...] "Puma" [...] during the fourth match, which may or may not be an indicator of a permanent name change. Puma teamed up with La Fievre Amarilla ("Yellow fever"), the team of Okumura and Namajague to take on Rey Cometa, Stuka, Jr. and Tritón. The match served as a continuation of the storyline between Puma and Rey Cometa, that had already seen Puma win a match to unmask Rey Cometa at the CMLL 79th Anniversary Show. The two kept the intensity up with Rey Cometa pinning Puma to win the first fall and Puma pinning Rey Cometa to win the second fall. In the third fall Okumura took advantage of a distracted referee to land an illegal low blow on Stuka, Jr. to get the third fall for his team The fifth match centered around the developing rivalry between experienced rudo Averno and the up-and-coming tecnico Titán that had started the previous week. For this match Averno teamed up with Niebla Roja and Pólvora while Titán was joined by Guerrero Maya, Jr. and La Sombra. The focus lay solidly on the feud between Averno and Titán throughout the match, especially as Averno began to tear at Titán's mask, ripping it open. Averno's team took the first fall, then Averno himself pinned Titán after he applied his signature [...] "Devil's Wings" [...] move (a Spinning lifting sitout double underhook facebuster). Following the match Averno challenged Titán to defend his Mexican National Welterweight Championship against Averno the following week, a challenge Titán accepted.|$|E
