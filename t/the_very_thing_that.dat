However, some Cournot strategy profiles are sustained as Nash equilibria but can be eliminated as incredible threats (as described above) by applying the solution concept of subgame perfection. Indeed, it is <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> makes a Cournot strategy profile a Nash equilibrium in a Stackelberg game that prevents it from being subgame perfect.|$|E

25|$|Considerable {{work has}} been {{published}} {{on the evolution of}} ant dulosis and almost all of it has at least some empirical evidence to defend its positions. Notably, that nearly all raiding ant species have is an adaptation of their mandibles that make them big or piercing or both. It makes sense that <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> enables an ant to be a better raider causes that same ant to become dependent on others; the parasite loses the use of its mandibles for actual work. On this and other evidence, it has been proposed that predation is the precursor to slavery. It has also been suggested that colony multiplication by adoption and budding followed by temporary parasitism can lead to dulosis. While observations indicate that colony multiplication can lead to temporary parasitism, it is apparently very questionable that temporary parasitism leads to dulosis.|$|E

500|$|Avicenna anticipates {{that one}} could reject the {{argument}} {{by saying that the}} collection of contingent things may not be contingent. A whole does not automatically share the features of its parts; for example, in mathematics a set of numbers is not a number. Therefore, the objection goes, the step in the argument that assumes that the collection of contingent things is also contingent, is wrong. However, Avicenna dismisses this counter-argument as a capitulation, and not an objection at all. If the entire collection of contingent things is not contingent, then it must be necessary. This also leads to the conclusion that there is a necessary existent, the very thing Avicenna is trying to prove. Avicenna remarks, [...] "in a certain way, this is <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> is sought".|$|E
500|$|In Karnick's eyes, {{contemporary}} {{critics have}} failed {{to see how the}} film has affected audiences and subsequently branded the film series as [...] "both irresponsible (for numbing audiences to violence) and puritanical (for showing the murders of sexually active teens)". Quoting director John Carpenter, Karnick emphasized that [...] "teens thus dispatched became victims not as punishment for sexual activity but simply because they were too preoccupied to notice the presence of a murderer". Pointing to Roger Ebert as a prime example of how critics have misunderstood the films (Ebert wrote that during a screening of Friday the 13th Part 2, he noticed that the audience had no sympathy for the victims and cheered during death scenes), Karnick explains that Ebert's remarks show how the film series forces [...] "audiences to experience <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> motivates the murders: a lack of compassion". In closing, Karnick suggested that these films were not puritanical, but proved that audiences [...] "could be just as indifferent and callous as the characters in the films".|$|E

2500|$|In May 2016, three IMF economists {{published}} {{new research}} findings and criticized {{some of the}} fundamental assumptions of the neoliberal doctrine. They warned that austerity policies could {{do more harm than}} good because of their social costs – increased inequality, which [...] "in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth". Speaking of capital account liberalization, that is unrestricted movement of capital across international borders ("openness") and fiscal consolidation, meaning policies to reduce fiscal deficits and debt levels ("austerity"), they wrote: [...] "Since both openness and austerity are associated with increasing income inequality, this distributional effect sets up an adverse feedback loop. The increase in inequality engendered by financial openness and austerity might itself undercut growth, <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> the neoliberal agenda is intent on boosting. There is now strong evidence that inequality can significantly lower both the level and the durability of growth". [...] Additionally, they recommended actively combating inequality by redistributing wealth via taxes and government spending, noting [...] "the evidence of the economic damage from inequality suggests that policymakers should be more open to redistribution than they are" [...] and [...] "the fear that such policies will themselves necessarily hurt growth is unfounded".|$|E

2500|$|The philosopher Michel Foucault, in his {{preface to}} Anti-Oedipus, {{writes that the}} book can best be read as an [...] "art", {{in the sense that}} is {{conveyed}} by the term [...] "erotic art." [...] Foucault sees the three [...] "adversaries" [...] of Anti-Oedipus as being the [...] "bureaucrats of the revolution", the [...] "poor technicians of desire" [...] (psychoanalysts and semiologists), and fascism, which Foucault calls [...] "the major enemy". Foucault uses the term [...] "fascism" [...] to refer [...] "not only historical fascism, the fascism of Hitler and Mussolini...but also the fascism in us all, in our heads and in our everyday behavior, the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> dominates and exploits us." [...] Foucault adds that Anti-Oedipus is [...] "a book of ethics, the first book of ethics to be written in France in quite a long time", and that this perhaps its popular success. Foucault suggests that the book could be called Introduction to the Non-Fascist Life. Foucault argues that putting the principles espoused in Anti-Oedipus into practice involves freeing political action from [...] "unitary and totalizing paranoia" [...] and withdrawing allegiance [...] "from the old categories of the Negative (law, limit, castration, lack, lacuna), which western thought has so long held sacred as a form of power and an access to reality." [...] The psychiatrist David Cooper calls Anti-Oedipus, [...] "a magnificent vision of madness as a revolutionary force", crediting its authors with using [...] "the psychoanalytic language and the discourse of Saussure (and his successors), linguistics against itself in what is already proving to be an historic act of depassment." [...] The critic Frederick Crews writes that when Deleuze and Guattari [...] "indicted Lacanian psychoanalysis as a capitalist disorder" [...] and [...] "pilloried analysts as the most sinister priest-manipulators of a psychotic society" [...] in Anti-Oedipus, their [...] "demonstration was widely regarded as unanswerable" [...] and [...] "devastated the already shrinking Lacanian camp in Paris." ...|$|E
