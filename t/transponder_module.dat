40|$|WO 200014680 A UPAB: 20000606 NOVELTY - The <b>transponder</b> <b>module</b> has {{a single}} {{insulating}} carrier substrate. carrying an antenna arrangement on a first surface, an unhoused chip in a substrate aperture and with upper and lower surfaces flush {{with those of the}} substrate, and electrical connectors (4, 12, 14) between the chip and antenna. A second substrate surface is essentially completely covered by a metallisation coating (4). The chip has at least one connecting surface on first and second main surfaces with one antenna connecting end (12) connected to the first chip connecting surface and a second (14) connected via through contacts (16) to the second connecting surface. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for an electronic label and a method of producing a <b>transponder</b> <b>module.</b> USE - Esp. for electronic labels. ADVANTAGE - An ultraflat <b>transponder</b> <b>module</b> can be mass-produced at economical cost...|$|E

40|$|A {{prototype}} wireless data-communication {{and control}} system automatically modifies the switching of traffic lights to {{give priority to}} emergency vehicles. The system, which was reported in several NASA Tech Briefs articles at earlier stages of development, includes a transponder on each emergency vehicle, a monitoring and control unit (an intersection controller) at each intersection equipped with traffic lights, and a central monitoring subsystem. An essential component {{of the system is}} a software module executed by a microcontroller in each <b>transponder.</b> This <b>module</b> integrates and broadcasts data on the position, velocity, acceleration, and emergency status of the vehicle. The position, velocity, and acceleration data are derived partly from the Global Positioning System, partly from deductive reckoning, and partly from a diagnostic computer aboard the vehicle. The software module also monitors similar broadcasts from other vehicles and from intersection controllers, informs the driver of which intersections it controls, and generates visible and audible alerts to inform the driver of any other emergency vehicles that are close enough to create a potential hazard. The execution of the software module can be monitored remotely and the module can be upgraded remotely and, hence, automaticall...|$|R
40|$|The AMSAT AO- 40 {{satellite}} now on orbit contains {{several experiments}} controlled through a module called RUDAK. It is presently in an extended GTO orbit with an apogee of about 58, 000 km. The primary mission of this satellite {{is to provide}} a platform for multiple communications <b>transponders.</b> The RUDAK <b>module</b> provides digital communications functions as well as serving as the controller for most of the exp eriments onboard. This paper focuses on RUDAK and the associated experiments. The RUDAK module is capable of providing a wide variety of digital communications functions and includes dual processors, mass memory and a suite of hardware and DSP modems. It has connectivity to the transponders, main housekeeping computer and to the experiments onboard. To this point in the mission it has been exercised primarily as an experiment controller. The experiments operated through RUDAK include: - two cameras - an equipment set for receiving and measuring GPS signals - a radiation measurement experiment - an experiment to measure HF signal characteristics - two CAN bus temperatures measurement nodes. Interesting and in some cases unique results have been obtained from the GPS, radiation monitor, cameras and temperature measurement nodes. The associated principal investigators are reporting details of those results independently. This paper describes the RUDAK experiment control module, how it was designed and optimized for this mission, how it controls and interacts with the experiments, the software issues associated with this function, operational issues and successful experiment interaction achieved so far. A summary of the results from some of the experiments is included, with emphasis on the unique data, but {{the focus is on the}} design and operation of RUDAK as an experiment controller. Information on those design and operational features that have worked well as well those that have provided challenges are included...|$|R
