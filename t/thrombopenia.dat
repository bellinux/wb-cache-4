40|$|Na nizu od 80 bolesnika s kroničnom reumatskom upalom, liječenih solima zlata, promatrane su i analizirane popratne pojave auroterapije. Egzacerbacija reumatskog procesa u foku primjene zlata smatra se »reakcijom na auroterapiju«. Ona se obično javlja u početku liječenja, ali može nastati i kasnije. »Popratne pojave« u pravom smislu očituju se na koži, sluznicama, bubregu, živčanom sistemu i krvi. Te popratne pojave katkad zahtijevaju prekid auroterapije 62, 5 % bolesnika je završilo auroterapiju, a 32, 5 % moralo je prekinuti liječenje zbog popratnih pojava. Veliko značenje pridaje se profilaksi popratnih pojava. U tu svrhu potrebna je redovna kontrola kože i sluznica, te laboratorijski pregledi krvi i mokraće. Doze zlata treba povisivati postepeno i oprezno. Važno je, da se rani znaci intolerancije pravovremeno uoče i odmah primijene odgovarajuće mjere, jer se tako može izbjeći opasnost po bolesnika. In {{our series}} of 80 {{patients}} suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and treated with gold-salts the side-effects have been observed and analyzed. The results obtained are compared with data from literature. The symptoms of the basic disease growing worse {{in the sense of}} the exacerbation of the rheumatic process, which usually occurs at the beginning of the treatment but may appear also later, arc regarded as »the reaction to aurotherapy«. In one case they manifested themselves in a serious general clinical picture. Side-effects manifest themselves on the skin, on the mucous membranes, on the kidneys, on the nervous system and in the blood, and should always be met with caution; it is often necessary to discontinue aurotherapy or lo apply a special treatment. But there are several gradations and all side-effects are not equally heavy. In pruritus, a light itching, appearing gradually and usually ceasing when the dose of gold is reduced, is to be distinguished from a sudden, intense itching which is often an alarm for an: imminent dermatitis. Dermatitis was observed in four patients. Relatively frequent is a bitter metallic taste in the mouth, which usually ceases spontaneously; gingivitis was observed only in two patients. Temporary aches in the stomach or heart-burning do not indicate a serious danger, except for gastroduodenal ulcus in which case aurotherapy is not indicated. Side-effects on the kidney are not frequent but may be serious: in one case it came to a transitory slight albuminuria and cilindruria. The most serious side-effects may occur in the blood. Three heavy leucopenias, seven <b>thrombopenias</b> (in two cases they were combined) and two slight purpuras were recorded. In such cases the treatment must be discontinued immediately. Eosinophilia is a frequet sign of an approaching danger. All side-effects recorded passed and there were no permanent injuries. In 62. 5 % of the patients aurotherapy was fully applied, while in 32. 5 % it was discontinued on account of side-effects due to gold. Heavier side-effects require a special treatment: application of calcium and Vitamin C, corticosteroids, ACTH and BAL, which was applied in three patients with good results. Great importance is attached to the prevention of side-effects. For this purpose a regular control of the skin and mucous membranes is necessary, as well as regular laboratory examinations of the blood and urine. In addition, all patients were given vitamin C per is in doses of 2 g a day. The dose of gold should be increased gradually and cautiously. A small number of more serious side-effects shows that gold, under the precautions set forth, can successfully be applied in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis. It is essential that the early signs of intolerance should be discovered in time and treated immediately, by which any danger for the patient is avoided...|$|R

50|$|In addition, {{electrolyte}} imbalances such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia {{are also}} common. In the liver, increased liver enzymes and hepatotoxicity (up {{to and including}} fulminant liver failure) are common. In the circulatory system, several forms of anemia and other blood dyscrasias (leukopenia, <b>thrombopenia),</b> serious cardiac arrhythmias (including ventricular fibrillation), and even frank cardiac failure have been reported.

50|$|Many {{patients}} with aplastic anemia also have clones of cells {{characteristic of the}} rare disease paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH, anemia with <b>thrombopenia</b> and/or thrombosis), {{sometimes referred to as}} AA/PNH. Occasionally PNH dominates over time, with the major manifestation intravascular hemolysis. The overlap of AA and PNH has been speculated to be an escape mechanism by the bone marrow against destruction by the immune system. Flow cytometry testing is performed regularly in people with previous aplastic anemia to monitor for the development of PNH.|$|E
50|$|The signal {{transmission}} {{of large numbers}} of proinflammatory cytokines is dependent on JAK1. Inhibition of JAK2 may also contribute to the efficacy against RA. Nonetheless it is thought that JAK2 inhibition might lead to anemia and <b>thrombopenia</b> by interference with erythropoietin and thrombopoietin and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Therefore, one might prefer to choose a more selective JAK1 inhibitor as a primary therapeutic option. Filgotinib exerts a 30-fold selectivity for JAK1 compared to JAK2. It is however still to be seen to what extent JAK2 inhibition should be avoided.|$|E

At his first trainings with the club, coach Ernesto Valverde told Katai {{that he did}} not defend enough and that he needed to improve as a player. Katai did not play a single match for Olympiacos, but was instead sent on loan four times. He was first loaned to OFI Crete, with whom he made his debut on 5 November 2011, against Panionios. The loan spell to Crete was unsuccessful, and so Olympiacos loaned him back to his hometown club FK Vojvodina. While on loan at Vojvodina, in 2012 after one game with Spartak Subotica, he felt very ill and went to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with <b>thrombopenia.</b> He had to have some blood removed and stayed in the hospital for two weeks before he was allowed to recover from home. During his recovery, he had gained over 20 pounds, and did not return to play football {{until the end of the}} year. He remained a loaned player for Vojvodina until the club president Ratko Butorović died unexpectedly on 8 June 2013, which led to a period of instability in the club during which Katai left. He subsequently was loaned to Platanias, for whom he scored a total of eight goals and six assists until his loan there expired in the summer of 2014.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the clinical efficacy and safety of high-dose imatinib (IM) for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients by pooled published studies. Methods: Through searching the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, ASCO, ESMO, CNKI, and Wanfang, we collected open published clinical controlled trials-related high-dose IM treatment of CML. The pooled complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and hematologic toxicities were calculated by the statistical software. Results: Seven studies were included in this study with 1137 cases received high-dose IM treatment and 958 cases received regular-dose IM treatment. The pooled results showed that patients received high-dose IM had higher CCyR compared with regular-dose with the odds ratio (OR) of 1. 75 (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI]: 1. 44 – 2. 1, P < 0. 05) and 1. 58 (95 % CI: 1. 38 – 1. 81, P < 0. 05) in 6 and 12 months.

40|$|Exposure to {{ionizing}} radiation alone (radiation injury, RI) or combined with traumatic tissue injury (radiation combined injury, CI) {{is a crucial}} life-threatening factor in nuclear and radiological accidents. As demonstrated in animal models, CI results in greater mortality than RI. In our laboratory, we found that B 6 D 2 F 1 /J female mice exposed to 60 Co-γ-photon radiation followed by 15 % total-body-surface-area skin burns experienced an increment of 18 % higher mortality over a 30 -day observation period compared to irradiation alone; that was accompanied by severe cytopenia, <b>thrombopenia,</b> erythropenia, and anemia. At the 30 th day after injury, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets still remained very low in surviving RI and CI mice. In contrast, their RBC, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were similar to basal levels. Comparing CI and RI mice, only RI induced splenomegaly. Both RI and CI resulted in bone marrow cell depletion. It was observed that only the RI mice treated with pegylated G-CSF after RI resulted in 100 % survival over the 30 -day period, and pegylated G-CSF mitigated RI-induced body-weight loss and depletion of WBC and platelets. Peg-G-CSF treatment sustained RBC balance, hemoglobin levels, and hematocrits and inhibited splenomegaly after RI. The results suggest that pegylated G-CSF effectively sustained animal survival by mitigating radiation-induced cytopenia, <b>thrombopenia,</b> erythropenia, and anemia...|$|E
40|$|Endotoxemia in {{patients}} {{can lead to}} sepsis and shock by activation of cellular and plasmatic systems. Corticosteroids are described to have a beneficial effect on these phenomena. In this study of controlled endotoxic shock, we investigated the protective effects of prophylactic corticosteroid treatment against activation of cellular and plasmatic systems. In this respect, a low-dose methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg body wt) treatment was {{compared with that of}} a high-dose methylprednisolone (40 mg/kg body wt) treatment. Endotoxin infusion induced death of all rabbits, which was associated with leukopenia, <b>thrombopenia,</b> increased levels of beta-glucuronidase, and leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) and decreased levels of complement total hemolytic activity (CH 50) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity. Both methylprednisolone regimens prevented death of the rabbits after endotoxin infusion, which correlated with a significant decrease of the granulocyte release product beta-glucuronidase (P < 0. 01). The early leukopenia and <b>thrombopenia</b> were not prevented; however, both cell numbers returned more rapidly to baseline values than in the placebo group (P < 0. 01, P < 0. 05). The LTB 4 and CH 50 concentration and t-PA activity did not differ significantly between the treated and placebo groups. These results indicate that although methylprednisolone has no inhibitory effect on the activation of the complement, arachidonic acid, and fibrinolytic systems, it protected the animals from the deleterious effects of endotoxin shock by inhibition of leukocyte activation. In this regard a low dosage of methylprednisolone is equally effective as the most often recommended high dose...|$|E

30|$|The optimal {{management}} of NE {{has been a}} matter of debate [1, 8, 11, 51]. Physicians are frequently reluctant to select surgery as the first-choice treatment in neutropenic patients, based on a potential risk of higher infectious and hemorrhagic complications, although no publications support this idea. Interestingly, an appropriately early indication for appendectomy or cholecystectomy in neutropenic hematology patients was not associated with problematic postoperative course [52, 53]. Similarly, in 85 hematology patients who underwent surgery for acute abdominal complication, neutropenia and <b>thrombopenia</b> were not associated with outcome [54].

40|$|International audienceNeonatal <b>thrombopenia</b> {{occurs when}} the mother generates {{antibodies}} against her baby’s platelet antigens. It is particularly critical for newborns because it can cause coagulation troubles leading to intracranial hemorrhage. In this case, diagnosis must be done quickly to make platelets transfusion immediately after birth. Before transfusion, platelet antigens must be tested carefully to avoid rejection. The majority of <b>thrombopenia</b> (95 %) are caused by antibodies directed against Human Platelet Antigen 1 a (HPA- 1 a) or 5 b (HPA- 5 b). The common method for antigen platelets detection is polymerase chain reaction allowing for identification of gene sequence. However, it is expensive, time-consuming and requires significant blood volume which is not suitable for newborns. We propose to develop a point-of-care device based on double functionalized magnetic colloids with 1) antibodies specific to antigen platelets and 2) highly sensitive electroactive molecules {{in order to be}} detected by an electrochemical microsensor. These magnetic colloids will be used first to isolate platelets from other blood components, then to capture specifically platelets bearing HPA- 1 a and HPA- 5 b antigens and finally to attract them close to sensor working electrode for improved electrochemical signal. The expected advantages are an assay time lower than 20 min starting from blood volume smaller than 100 µL. Our functionalization procedure based on amine dendrimers and NHS-ester modification of initial carboxyl colloids will be presented. Functionalization efficiency was evaluated by colorimetric titration of surface chemical groups, zeta potential measurements, infrared spectroscopy, fluorescence scanning and cyclic voltammetry.
