5|$|Yui {{is a big}} fan and {{initially}} an assistant to Girls Dead Monster. She {{is known to be}} hyperactive and talks extremely fast. Hinata finds Yui annoying, which results in bouts {{between the two of them}} though in truth, they truly care about one another, saying that had they met before they died, they would have fallen in love with one another. She wears a devil tail and shackle bracelets on her wrists, giving her an image of an imp or devil. She also has wings hidden by her hair on her back. After Iwasawa's departure, Yui becomes the new rhythm guitarist and vocalist of Girls Dead Monster, as well as its leader. Yui plays a Gibson SG Special electric guitar. She later becomes a part of the main SSS, following them along on missions, though she does not contribute much. In life, she was hit by a car and was paralyzed from a young age as a result. Her regret was not being able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>with</b> her body. Otonashi helps fulfill most of her wishes that include many things she saw on TV when she was alive, although it is Hinata who fulfills her last desire to be married by proposing to her.|$|E

A groundout moved Panik to third, and he scored on a single to center by Hunter Pence. Danny Duffy {{replaced}} Frasor in the game. Pablo Sandoval singled and Brandon Belt walked to load the bases. Juan Pérez hit a sinking liner to center, but it was caught by a diving Jarrod Dyson. Pence tagged up at third and scored the tying run. Duffy struck out Brandon Crawford to end the inning.|$|E

Vallombrosa Vale Cottages. No. 1. Doctor and Miss Dulcifer. Very good. I have no preferences. Let me sell the first two tickets there. I found the place; I opened the garden gate; I advanced to the door, innocently wondering what sort of people I should find inside.|$|R

500|$|When an {{interviewer}} commented that Anarky was popular among fans in 2003, {{in the midst}} of the character's period of obscurity, Norm Breyfogle offered a caveat: [...] "Well, in certain segments of the comic book industry, I suppose." [...] Breyfogle continued, [...] "It has some diehard fans. But, DC doesn't seem to want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>with</b> him. Maybe it's because of his anti-authoritarian philosophy, a very touchy subject in today's world." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} {{hesitant}} {{to comment on}} the future of Slipknot. The members made conflicting statements in interviews; drummer Jordison told The Pulse of Radio [...] "there is another Slipknot record already kinda in the making". Vocalist Taylor told FMQB Productions he was [...] "very conflicted about whether or not [...] <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>with</b> Slipknot". The band released their fourth video album (sic)nesses on September 28, 2010; it debuted at number one on the Billboard Top Music Video Charts. The DVD features Slipknot's entire live performance at the 2009 Download Festival and a 45-minute film documenting their tour in support of All Hope Is Gone, and served as a tribute to Paul Gray.|$|E

500|$|Another {{important}} Czech musicologist, Zdeněk Nejedlý, a great {{admirer of}} Smetana {{and later a}} communist Minister of Culture, condemned Janáček as an author who could accumulate a lot of material, but was unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>with</b> it. He called Janáček's style [...] "unanimated", and his operatic duets [...] "only speech melodies", without polyphonic strength. Nejedlý considered Janáček rather an amateurish composer, whose music did not conform to the style of Smetana. According to Charles Mackerras, he tried to professionally destroy Janáček. Josef Bartoš, the Czech aesthetician and music critic, called Janáček a [...] "musical eccentric" [...] who clung tenaciously to an imperfect, improvising style, but Bartoš appreciated some elements of Janáček's works and judged him more positively than Nejedlý.|$|E
500|$|Artist Alex Ross and writer/producer Paul Dini made {{attempts}} {{to return the}} character to her original conception. Ross explained {{in an interview that}} he and Dini had planned to restore her mobility by placing her in a Lazarus Pit, a naturally occurring chemical pool in the DC Universe that has rejuvenating effects when a person is submerged within it. He stated that [...] "we pitched then-Batman editor Denny O'Neil with these drawings of that costume design. The idea of using the red instead of the traditional yellow was meant to invoke the idea that coming from the Lazarus Pit, she was in a way, more compromised as a character... Denny shot it down, because, according to him, everybody loves Barbara Gordon as Oracle and as a handicapped character. The theory was that DC didn't have enough handicapped characters, so they weren't going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>with</b> Barbara as she was. And the design went into the drawer." [...] Kate Kane, the modern Batwoman introduced during 52, wears a variation of what would have been Gordon's new Batgirl costume designed by Ross.|$|E
500|$|Disagreements {{about the}} {{ownership}} of the story ultimately led Moore to sever ties with DC Comics. Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for Watchmen. Speaking at the 1985 San Diego Comic-Con, Moore said: [...] "The way it works, if I understand it, is that DC owns it for the time they're publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we {{can make all the}} money from the Slurpee cups." [...] For Watchmen, Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series' earnings. Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when [...] "DC have not used the characters for a year, they're ours." [...] Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them [...] "a substantial amount of money" [...] to retain the rights. Moore added, [...] "So basically they're not ours, but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be. On the other hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn't want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>with</b> them, then after a year we've got them and we can do what we want with them, which I'm perfectly happy with." ...|$|E

2500|$|Security Bank of Harrison foreclosed on the Dogpatch, USA {{property}} {{in order to}} recover $485,000 in debt from park owner Melvin Bell. On December 20, 1994, the park was put up for auction on the courthouse steps in Jasper. The auction was handled by Jim Sprott, a Harrison lawyer whose [...] wife Jan had been [...] "Daisy Mae" [...] at Dogpatch USA from 1968 through the 1970 season; Sprott himself had played Earthquake McGoon and Luke Scraggs. C.L. and Ford Carr of Leisuretek Corporation and Westek Corporation received a quit claim for the property.

2500|$|Jane Rackham {{from the}} Radio Times called the episode [...] "highly topical", while Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror said: [...] "With London hosting the Games, {{this is an}} {{appropriate}} and ambitious story for Enders to tackle", and called both Fenwick and Harold [...] "superb". Jaci Stephen from the Daily Mail questioned the choice of Billy for the torch, saying, [...] "Many people have carried the Olympic torch—sports men and women, entertainers, individuals who have contributed something to their community—so why oh why did Walford choose Billy for the honour? Failed husband, failed father—heck, even failed criminal, it's {{hard to see how}} he will manage <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>with</b> it other than burn down Albert Square." [...] Talking of the live insert, she said, [...] "maybe [...] just so that Billy can ruin the thing for the whole nation, as opposed to just Walford." [...] Boyd Hilton from Heat said Billy carrying the Olympic torch was a [...] "gimmick", and said the entire episode should have been live, whilst Heat Karen Edwards said Harold acting out a live birth would be [...] "amazing", adding, [...] "much respect goes out to Danielle who will be working hard to make the episode a success." ...|$|E
