40|$|We have {{analyzed}} daily rainfall trends {{throughout the}} second half of the 20 th century in the western Mediterranean basin (Valencia Region, E of Spain). The area is characterized by high <b>torrentiality,</b> and during {{the second half}} of the 20 th century some of the highest daily rainfall values in the Mediterranean basin have been recorded. In this area, mean annual rainfall varies between 500 and 300 mm and is over-whelmingly dependent on just a few days of rain. Daily max-imum rainfall varies on average from 120 mm day 1 to 50 mm day 1, and represents a mean of 17 % (coastland) to 9 % (inland) of annual rainfall. The 10 days in each year with the heaviest rainfall (called ‘‘higher events’’) provide over 50 % of the annual rainfall and can reach more than 400 mm on average. We compared the annual rainfall trend and the trend of higher and minor events defined by percen-tiles, both in volume and variability. We, therefore, tested whether annual rainfall changes depend on the trend of the higher (rainfall) events. To overlap spatial distribution of trends (i. e. : positive, no significant and negative trends) we have used cross-tab anal-ysis. The results confirm the hypothesis that annual rainfall changes depend on changes found in just a few rainy events. Furthermore, in spite of their negative trend, higher events have increased their contribution to annual rainfall. As a consequence, although torrential events may have diminished in magnitude, future scenarios seem to be controlled by a limited number of rainy events which will become more and more variable year on year. The high spa-tial density of data used in this work, (97 observatories per 24. 000 km 2, overall mean 1 observatory per 200 km 2), sug-gests to us that extreme caution should be applied when an-alyzing regional and sub-regional changes in rainfall using GCM output, especially in areas of high <b>torrentiality.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|The ECA dataset {{of daily}} {{precipitation}} observations {{was used to}} study the temporal variability of seasonal extreme precipitation amounts over a 54 -year time period in the southern plain areas of Romania. Extreme events resulting in exceptional precipitation amounts cumulated over one to three consecutive days {{and the frequency of}} very heavy precipitation events (as defined by the ETCCDI) were analyzed to reveal the changes in the seasonality of precipitation <b>torrentiality</b> and its frequency. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall test (MK) and Sen's slope method were used to test the statistical significance, spatial robustness of the observed trends and their magnitude. A clear change signal was found for autumn, winter and autumn, with a high number of sites with statistically significant trends. The upward trends suggesting more intense precipitation events in these seasons were found at most sites as compared with summer, for which the MK statistics returned less consistent changes. There is a negative trend in the number of wet days associated with a dominantly upward in R 20 frequency, for autumn and winter...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of {{sediment}} yield and the factors controlling it provides useful information for estimating erosion intensities within river basins. The {{objective of this}} study was to build a model from which suspended sediment yield could be estimated from ungauged rivers using computed sediment yield and physical factors. Researchers working on suspended sediment transported by wadis in the Maghreb are usually facing the lack of available data for such river types. Further study of the prediction {{of sediment}} transport in these regions and its variability is clearly required. In this work, ANNs were built between sediment yield established from longterm measurement series at gauging stations in Algerian catchments and corresponding basic physiographic parameters such as rainfall, runoff, lithology index, coefficient of <b>torrentiality,</b> and basin area. The proposed Levenberg-Marquardt and Multilayer Perceptron algorithms to train the neural networks of the current research study was based on the feed-forward backpropagation method with combinations of number of neurons in each hidden layer, transfer function, error goal. Additionally, three statistical measurements, namely the root mean square error (RMSE), the coefficient of determination (R²), and the efficiency factor (EF) have been reported for examining the forecasting accuracy of the developed model. Single plot displays of network outputs with respect to targets for training have provided good performance results and good fitting. Thus, ANNs were a promising method for predicting suspended sediment yield in ungauged Algerian catchments...|$|E
40|$|The hydrographic {{basin of}} the Miletin River is {{situated}} in the southeast of Europe, in a transitional temperate-continental climate, with considerable variations in the regime of precipitations. The {{purpose of this study}} is the spatial and temporal analysis of the mean seasonal discharges, meant to underline the need of implementing regulation projects for the Miletin stream. Furthermore, there are only a few specialized works on this hydrographic basin. The mean seasonal runoff presents significant seasonal and multiannual variations, caused by the high frequency of <b>torrentiality,</b> which characterizes the climate of the Miletin River area. Data from the rainfall stations of Nicolae Balcescu, Chiscareni, and Halceni, as well as from the hydrometric stations of Nicolae Balcescu, Sipote, and Halceni- downstream, respectively, were used. Unlike the stations with a natural runoff regime (Nicolae Balcescu, within the upper basin, Sipote within the middle basin, respectively), for Halceni-downstream (on the lower stream), the artificial runoff underlines a weak correlation with the rainfall regime. The data rows regard periods of 33 - 59 years, enough to conduct statistical analyses. Data from Halceni- downstream were analyzed, too, though the variables that characterize the hydrologic and rainfall regime within this region concern only 18 years. In the Miletin hydrographic basin, low and high discharge oscillations occur in all the four seasons. This characteristic is very different from those of the great hydrographic arteries that cross the east of Romania: Pruth and Siret...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. THE CORRELATIONBETWEEN TORRENTIAL RAINFALLAND THE INTENSITY OF SOIL EROSION. Rain erosion in generai is of {{importance}} and considerable interest; the part played by torrential rainfall however deserves specialattention. All rainfall {{does not cause}} soi) erosion, but ther is a correlationbetween heavy rainfall and such erosion. The point at wich raiacauses noticable erosion to start {{is more or less}} specific for a givenarea and depend up on different factors such as the slope the vegetation,the physical and chemical properties of the soi), the geologica) substrata and so on. Apart from these factors wich have a more or less auxiliary cha-racter in the phenomenon of erosion, it is intensity rainfalwich plays the most important and decisive role. This erosive characterof torrential rain manifests itself partly through the directe actionof rain drops with consequent separation of soi) particles and partlyby transport of materials through run-of f and their removal in thebed of water courses. There is a very definate correlation between these two aspects i. e. between erosion of the soi) and the transport of materials on solidson the,hand the intensity of torrental rainfall on the other hand. Torrential rainfall is considered as rain with a minimum preci-pitation of 3 o m in one day/usualy limited to the sumer seasonwhen rainfall is more concentrated/, or alternatively any rainfall ofless than one hours duration but with a minimum intensity equivalentto 0, 3 mm per minute. After many observations on a mountanous area subject to torrentialrain and consisting of 31 bassins draming finto torrents, the followingsfacts were noted :I) That rain erosion becomes most marked and transport of materialbecomes most noticable when rainfall reaches an intensity of 0, 3 to 0, 5 mm per minute. 2) That the quantity of solids removed rises very steeply withincrease in intensity of rain above this limit. 3) That the total quantity of material removed f rom an area as a result of one exceptionally heavy rain/ in this specific case some 2 inni per minute / is often greater than the average amount of materialsmoved per year. The intensity of torrential raia being morenoteworthy f rom the viewpoint of erosion than total precipitation inan area. To determine the carrying capacity of a torrential water coursein terms of quantity of solids it is very convenient to apply Stiny'sformula modified by Hercheulidze and completed whit a coefficienttorrential « m », signifying the degre of <b>torrentiality</b> of the bassin. This formula however does not take finto account the intensity oftorrential rainfall wich is meritorious for soil erosion in the bassin,nor the f requency of such rainfall in a region. The author proposes a new formula to correct this and to take themessing factors finto account so that one can obtain a mor accuratirepresentation of relative degree of <b>torrentiality</b> and erosion in agivon area. To determine the degree of erosion / including the formation andtransport of materials by rainfall /, it is necessary bef ore all to determinethe rains in an area, wich have an erosive character as well astheir frequency during a given period - i. e. their average precipitaarea. -tion per year and nothe total precipitation of al rainfal in theThe paper also records some actual data regarding quantity materialsand solids transported. Il one wishes to apply or compare thesefacts and the results trought out in the text, it is necessary to takeall relevent factors which have been considered by the paper whitaccount, such as :a) An average rainfall intensity of 2 mm per minute. b) An mean duration about 20 minutes. c) A mean frequency of such rains six times in Ioo years. d) A slope of 18 to 22 %. e) The geological strata - crystalline schists in the upper reechesof the bassins covering about 50 % of the surface and neogene sedi-ments in the lowereches also covering about, 50 % of the totalsurface. f) Forest cover very modest - average about 10 % over the wholearea. g) Climate-continental with slight Mediterranean influence in theregion. h) Latitude of the area — 40 ° North. i) Annual precipitation averages 65 o mm...|$|E
