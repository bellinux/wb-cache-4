5|$|Another {{special case}} {{is where the}} contact angle is exactly 180°. Water with {{specially}} prepared <b>Teflon</b> approaches this. Contact angle of 180° occurs when the liquid–solid surface tension is exactly equal to the liquid–air surface tension.|$|E
5|$|Nylon {{used in the}} Block I suits was {{replaced}} in the Block II suits with Beta cloth, a non-flammable, highly melt-resistant fabric woven from fiberglass and coated with <b>Teflon.</b>|$|E

5|$|All of the {{currently}} used volatile anesthetic agents are organofluorine compounds. Aside from {{the synthesis of}} Freon (Thomas Midgley, Jr. and Charles F. Kettering, 1928) and the discovery of <b>Teflon</b> (Roy J. Plunkett, 1938), the field of organofluorine chemistry had not attracted {{a great deal of}} attention up to 1940 because of the extreme reactivity of elemental fluorine, which had to be produced in situ for use in chemical reactions. The development of organofluorine chemistry was a spin-off from the Manhattan Project, during which elemental fluorine was produced on an industrial scale for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Thermoplastics, by contrast, form long {{molecular}} chains, {{which are}} often coiled or intertwined, forming an amorphous structure without any long-range, crystalline order. Some thermoplastics may be fully amorphous, while others have a partially crystalline/partially amorphous structure. Both amorphous and semicrystalline thermoplastics have a glass transition, above which welding can occur, but semicrystallines also have a specific melting point which is above the glass transition. Above this melting point, the viscous liquid will become a free-flowing liquid (see rheological weldability for thermoplastics). Examples of thermoplastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride (PVC), and fluoroplastics like <b>Teflon</b> and Spectralon.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{the engineers}} struggled with {{was how to}} deal with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: <b>Teflon,</b> used as a gasket material, and closed-circuit television, used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.|$|E
5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and <b>Teflon</b> are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave {{as if they were}} free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, they are free to move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E
5|$|Many {{thermoplastics}} {{can also}} be welded using chemical solvents. When placed {{in contact with the}} plastic, the solvent will begin to soften it, bringing the surface into a thick, liquid solution. When two melted surfaces are pressed together, the molecules in the solution mix, joining them as one. Because the solvent can permeate the plastic, the solvent evaporates out through the surface of the plastic, causing the weld to drop out of solution and solidify. A common use for solvent welding is for joining PVC or ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) pipes during plumbing, or for welding styrene and polystyrene plastics in the construction of models. Solvent welding is especially effective on plastics like PVC which burn at or below their glass transition, but may be ineffective on plastics like <b>Teflon</b> or polyethylene that are resistant to chemical decomposition.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the expense}} of {{refining}} pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking. The rest of the fluorite is converted into corrosive hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into cryolite which {{plays a key role}} in aluminium refining. Organic fluorides have very high chemical and thermal stability; their major uses are as refrigerants, electrical insulation and cookware, the last as PTFE (<b>Teflon).</b> Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine also contain fluorine, and the fluoride ion inhibits dental cavities, and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation. Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US$15 billion a year.|$|E
5|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), {{sometimes}} called by its DuPont name <b>Teflon,</b> represents 60–80% by {{mass of the}} world's fluoropolymer production. The largest application is in electrical insulation since PTFE is an excellent dielectric. It is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed, in coating pipes, tubing, and gaskets. Another major use is in PFTE-coated fiberglass cloth for stadium roofs. The major consumer application is for non-stick cookware. Jerked PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a fine-pored membrane sometimes referred to by the brand name Gore-Tex and used for rainwear, protective apparel, and filters; ePTFE fibers may be made into seals and dust filters. Other fluoropolymers, including fluorinated ethylene propylene, mimic PTFE's properties and can substitute for it; they are more moldable, but also more costly and have lower thermal stability. Films from two different fluoropolymers replace glass in solar cells.|$|E
5|$|The Uue–Au bond {{should be}} the weakest of all bonds between gold and an alkali metal, but should still be stable. This gives {{extrapolated}} medium-sized adsorption enthalpies (−ΔHads) of 106kJ·mol−1 on gold (the francium value should be 136kJ·mol−1), 76kJ·mol−1 on platinum, and 63kJ·mol−1 on silver, the smallest of all the alkali metals, that demonstrate {{that it would be}} feasible to study the chromatographic adsorption of ununennium onto surfaces made of noble metals. The enthalpy of adsorption of ununennium on a <b>Teflon</b> surface is predicted to be 17.6kJ·mol−1, which would be the lowest among the alkali metals: this information would be very useful for future chemistry experiments on ununennium. The ΔHsub and −ΔHads values are not proportionally related for the alkali metals, as they change in opposite directions as atomic number increases.|$|E
5|$|Unambiguous {{determination}} of the chemical characteristics of nihonium has yet to have been established. The isotopes 284Nh, 285Nh, and 286Nh have half-lives long enough for chemical investigation. It is theoretically predicted that nihonium should have an enthalpy of sublimation around 150kJ/mol and an enthalpy of adsorption on a gold surface around −159kJ/mol. From 2010 to 2012, some preliminary chemical experiments were performed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research to determine the volatility of nihonium. The reaction used was 243Am(48Ca,3n)288Mc; the isotope 288Mc has a short half-life and would quickly decay to the longer-lived 284Nh, which would be chemically investigated. <b>Teflon</b> capillaries at 70°C connecting the recoil chamber, where the nihonium atoms were synthesized, and the gold-covered detectors: the nihonium atoms would be carried along the capillaries by a carrier gas. While about ten to twenty atoms of 284Nh were produced, none of these atoms were registered by the gold-covered detectors, suggesting either that nihonium was similar in volatility to the noble gases or, more plausibly, that pure nihonium was not very volatile and thus could not efficiently pass through the <b>Teflon</b> capillaries at 70°C. Formation of the hydroxide NhOH would ease the transport, as nihonium hydroxide {{is expected to be}} more volatile than elemental nihonium, and this reaction could be facilitated by adding more water vapor into the carrier gas. However, it seems likely that this formation is not kinetically favored, so that the longer-lived isotope 286Nh, created as the granddaughter of 294Ts, might be more desirable for future experiments.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{melting point}} of gallium {{allows it to}} melt in the human hand, and then refreeze if removed. The liquid metal has a strong {{tendency}} to supercool below its melting point/freezing point. Seeding with a crystal helps to initiate freezing. Gallium {{is one of the}} four metals (with caesium, rubidium, and mercury) that are known to be liquid at, or near, normal room temperature. Of the four, gallium {{is the only one that}} is neither highly reactive nor highly toxic and can therefore be used in metal-in-glass high-temperature thermometers. It is also notable for having one of the largest liquid ranges for a metal, and for having (unlike mercury) a low vapor pressure at high temperatures. Gallium's boiling point, 2673K, is more than eight times higher than its melting point on the absolute scale, the greatest ratio between melting point and boiling point of any element. Unlike mercury, liquid gallium metal wets glass and skin, along with most other materials (with the exceptions of quartz, graphite, and <b>Teflon),</b> making it mechanically more difficult to handle even though it is substantially less toxic and requires far fewer precautions. Gallium painted onto glass is a brilliant mirror. For this reason as well as the metal contamination and freezing-expansion problems, samples of gallium metal are usually supplied in polyethylene packets within other containers.|$|E

25|$|In 1958, a DuPont {{research}} {{manager in}} the <b>Teflon</b> business, Bill Gore, left the company because of its unwillingness to develop <b>Teflon</b> as wire-coating insulation. Gore's son Robert found a method for solving the wire-coating problem and the company W. L. Gore and Associates was born. In 1969, Robert Gore developed an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane {{which led to the}} large Gore-Tex business in breathable rainwear. The company developed many other uses of PTFE.|$|E
25|$|PTFE (<b>Teflon)</b> is {{best known}} for its use in coating {{non-stick}} frying pans and other cookware, as it is hydrophobic and possesses fairly high heat resistance.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} use of {{hydrofluoric acid}} is in organofluorine chemistry. Many organofluorine compounds are prepared using HF as the fluorine source, including <b>Teflon,</b> fluoropolymers, fluorocarbons, and refrigerants such as freon.|$|E
25|$|Tubing and {{connections}} : Various kinds of tubing {{can be used}} to connect the components of the respirometry system to and from the animal chamber. A variety of kinds of flexible tubing may be used, depending on the characteristics of the system. Acetyl, Bev-A-Line, Kynar, nylon, Tygon tubing and connectors may be used in regions of the system where oxidizing atmospheres are low (e.g., background levels of ozone only); <b>Teflon</b> tubing would be recommended if there is an expectation for appreciable amounts of ozone to be present because it is inert to ozone. <b>Teflon</b> tubes are more costly and lack flexibility.|$|E
25|$|In chemistry, {{polytetrafluoroethylene}} is {{a synthetic}} fluoropolymer which finds numerous applications. PTFE {{is best known}} by the DuPont brand name <b>Teflon.</b> PTFE was accidentally invented by Roy Plunkett of Kinetic Chemicals in 1938.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Teflon</b> {{backbone}} interlaced {{with the}} ionic sulfonate groups gives Nafion a high operating temperature, e.g. up to 190°C, however, in membrane form, {{this is not}} possible due {{to the loss of}} water and mechanical strength.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} is {{conducted in the}} presence of a catalytic amount of mixed antimony halides. Chlorodifluoromethane is then converted into tetrafluoroethylene, the main precursor to <b>Teflon.</b> Before the Montreal Protocol, chlorodifluoromethane (designated as R-22) was also a popular refrigerant.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, DuPont started {{purchasing}} PFOA from then-Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company {{for use in}} {{the manufacturing}} of <b>teflon,</b> a product that brought DuPont a billion dollars a year profit by the 1990s. DuPont referred to PFOA as C8.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{highlights}} of the stadium is the suspended cantilever roofs. The <b>Teflon</b> fabric roof is lighter in weight and heat resistant. There is no beam support for the roof to ensure that the spectators will have a better view.|$|E
25|$|More {{theoretical}} plates lead {{to better}} separations. A spinning band distillation system uses a spinning band of <b>Teflon</b> or metal to force the rising vapors into close contact with the descending condensate, {{increasing the number of}} theoretical plates.|$|E
25|$|The {{generator}} {{also uses}} water cooling. Since the generator coils {{are at a}} potential of about 22 kV, an insulating barrier such as <b>Teflon</b> is used to interconnect the water line and the generator high-voltage windings. Demineralized water of low conductivity is used.|$|E
25|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene film {{capacitors}} {{are made}} with a dielectric of the synthetic fluoropolymer polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a hydrophobic solid fluorocarbon. They are manufactured both as metallized and as film/foil types, although poor adherence to the film makes metallization difficult. PTFE is often known by the DuPont trademark <b>Teflon.</b>|$|E
25|$|Propagating brush {{discharge}} {{is high in}} energy and dangerous.
