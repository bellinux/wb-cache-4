5|$|While Ferdinand {{kept the}} French occupied, Prussia {{had to contend}} with Sweden, Russia, and Austria, all of which wanted <b>to</b> <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> piece of Prussia for themselves. Prussia could lose Silesia to Austria, Pomerania to Sweden, Magdeburg to Saxony, and East Prussia to Poland or Russia: an entirely nightmarish scenario. By 1758, Frederick was {{increasingly}} concerned by the Russian advance from the east and marched to counter it. Just east of the Oder river in Brandenburg-Neumark, at the Battle of Zorndorf, on 25 August 1758 a Prussian army of 35,000 men fought a Russian army of 43,000. Both sides suffered heavy casualties but the Russians withdrew, and Frederick claimed victory. At the Battle of Tornow a month later, a Swedish army repulsed the Prussian army, but did not move on Berlin. By late summer, fighting had resulted in a draw. None of Prussia's enemies seemed willing to take the decisive steps to pursue Frederick into Prussia's heartland. The Austrian Feldmarshalleutnant Leopold Josef Graf Daun could have ended the war in October at Hochkirch, but he failed to follow up on his victory with a determined pursuit of Frederick's retreating army. This allowed Frederick time to recruit a new army over the winter.|$|E

Many colonists were ill-prepared <b>to</b> <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> new settlement on a frontier. When Captain John Smith became Virginia's third president, he proved the strong leader that the colony needed. Industry flourished and relations with Chief Powhatan's people improved.|$|E
25|$|Relations between Arabs and Berbers in al-Andalus {{had been}} tense {{in the years}} after the conquest. Berbers heavily outnumbered the Arabs in the province, had done the bulk of the fighting, and were {{assigned}} the harsher duties (e.g. garrisoning the more troubled areas). Although some Arab governors had cultivated their Berber lieutenants, others had grievously mistreated them. Mutinies by Berber soldiers were frequent; e.g., in 729, the Berber commander Munnus had revolted and managed <b>to</b> <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> rebel state in Cerdanya for a while.|$|E

The Great Explosion dealt with oddball human societies. The inhabitants here are not human and very odd by human standards.|$|R

25|$|The temple is spiritually {{the most}} {{significant}} shrine in Sikhism. It became a center of the Singh Sabha Movement between 1883 and 1920s. In the early 1980s, the temple became a center of conflict between the Indian government led by Indira Gandhi, some Sikh groups and a militant movement led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale seeking <b>to</b> <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> new nation named Khalistan from parts of India and Pakistan. In 1984, Gandhi sent in the army, leading to numerous deaths of militants, soldiers and civilians, as well as causing much damage to the temple {{and the destruction of}} Akal Takht.

25|$|It is suspected, though, {{that the}} figures of Bangladeshi {{migrants}} in India are too far-fetched to be accorded any credence. The diplomatic difficulty is increased {{by the failure of}} conspiracy theorists in India to comprehend that supporting Indian rebels in a plot <b>to</b> <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> Greater Bangladesh would bring very little strategic dividend to Bangladesh. Scholars have also reflected that under the guise of anti-Bangladeshi immigrant movement it is actually an anti-Muslim agenda pointed towards Bangladeshi Muslims by false propaganda and widely exaggerated claims on immigrant population. There also is an alleged parallel threat of turning Assam into a part of a Greater West Bengal.|$|E

The Colombian and Mexican cartels have discovered that {{it is much easier to}} smuggle large loads into West Africa and then break that up into smaller shipments to Europe – mostly Spain, the United Kingdom and France. Higher demand for cocaine in Western Europe in addition to North American interdiction campaigns has led to dramatically increased trafficking in the region: nearly 50% of all non-U.S. bound cocaine, or about 13% of all global flows, is now smuggled through West Africa.|$|E

25|$|Sunni Muslim traders of the Shafi'i fiqh, {{as well as}} Sufi Muslim traders from India, Oman and Yemen brought Islam to Indonesia. The {{earliest}} known {{mention of}} a small Islamic community midst the Hindus of Indonesia is credited to Marco Polo, about 1297 AD, whom he {{referred to as a}} new community of Moorish traders in Perlak. Over 15th and 16th centuries, a Muslim militant campaign led by Sultans attacked Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms and various communities in the Indonesian archipelago, with each Sultan trying <b>to</b> <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> region or island for control. Four diverse and contentious Islamic Sultanates emerged in north Sumatra (Aceh), south Sumatra, west and central Java, and in southern Borneo (Kalimantan).|$|E
25|$|The wave of {{raids on}} north Indian and western Indian kingdoms by Muslim warlords {{continued}} after Mahmud of Ghazni.

He sought <b>to</b> <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> principality for himself by expanding the Islamic world. Muhammad of Ghor sought a Sunni Islamic kingdom of his own extending east of the Indus river, and he thus {{laid the foundation for}} the Muslim kingdom called the Delhi Sultanate. Some historians chronicle the Delhi Sultanate from 1192 due to the presence and geographical claims of Muhammad Ghori in South Asia by that time.|$|E

25|$|The nearly {{simultaneous}} {{invasions of}} Honduras in 1524 by rival Spanish expeditions began {{an era of}} conflict among rival Spanish claimants {{as well as with}} the indigenous population. The major initial expeditions were led by Gil González Dávila, who hoped <b>to</b> <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> territory for his own rule, and by Cristóbal de Olid, who was dispatched from Cuba by Cortés. Once in Honduras, however, Olid succumbed to personal ambition and attempted to establish his own independent authority. Word of this reached Cortés in Mexico, and to restore his own authority, he ordered yet another expedition, this one under the command of Francisco de Las Casas. Then, doubting the trustworthiness of any subordinate, Cortés set out for Honduras himself. The situation was further complicated by the entry into Honduras of expeditions from Guatemala under Pedro de Alvarado and from Nicaragua under Hernando de Soto.|$|E
25|$|Public lecture courses {{offered some}} {{scientists}} who were unaffiliated with official organizations a forum to transmit scientific knowledge, at times even their own ideas, {{and the opportunity}} <b>to</b> <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> reputation and, in some instances, a living. The public, on the other hand, gained both knowledge and entertainment from demonstration lectures. Between 1735 and 1793, there were over seventy individuals offering courses and demonstrations for public viewers in experimental physics. Class sizes ranged from one hundred to four or five hundred attendees. Courses varied in duration from one to four weeks, to a few months, or even the entire academic year. Courses were offered at virtually any time of day; the latest occurred at 8:00 or 9:00 at night. One {{of the most popular}} start times was 6:00 pm, allowing the working population to participate and signifying the attendance of the nonelite.

25|$|Fascist Italy aimed <b>to</b> <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> new Roman Empire, while British forces aimed {{initially}} {{to retain the}} status quo. Italy launched various attacks around the Mediterranean, which were largely unsuccessful. With the introduction of German forces, Yugoslavia and Greece were overrun. Allied and Axis forces engaged in back and forth fighting across North Africa, with Axis interference in the Middle East causing fighting to spread there. With confidence high from early gains, German forces planned elaborate attacks to be launched to capture the Middle East and then to possibly attack the southern border of the Soviet Union. However, following three years of fighting, Axis forces were defeated in North Africa and their interference in the Middle East was halted. Allied forces then commenced an invasion of Southern Europe, resulting in the Italians deposing Mussolini and joining the Allies. A prolonged battle for Italy took place between Allied and German forces, and as the strategic situation changed in south-east Europe, British troops returned to Greece.|$|E
