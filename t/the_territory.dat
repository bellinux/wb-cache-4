5|$|By March 1808, Jennings {{believed}} that his {{future in the}} Harrison-dominated western part of <b>the</b> <b>territory</b> was bleak. By November he had left Vincennes and moved to Jeffersonville, in Clark County, Indiana Territory, before settling in nearby Charlestown. Jennings may have believed his political future would have more success {{in the eastern part}} of <b>the</b> <b>territory.</b> Settlements in the southeast and eastern portion of <b>the</b> <b>territory</b> opposed slavery and Harrison's aristocratic manner, which were similar to Jennings's beliefs, while the western portion of <b>the</b> <b>territory</b> and Vincennes area remained proslavery. Although petitions to allow slavery were received before the formation of the Indiana Territory, the issue attracted widespread attention in 1807 when Harrison and his supporters in the territorial legislature revived efforts to allow slavery in <b>the</b> <b>territory.</b> Jennings and his supporters who opposed slavery wrote writing articles appearing in the Vincennes Western Sun newspaper attacking Harrison's administration, its pro-slavery sentiments, and aristocratic policies.|$|E
5|$|In 1808, when Congressman Benjamin Parke {{resigned}} from office, Harrison ordered {{a special election}} to fill the vacancy. Jennings entered the race against Harrison's candidate, Thomas Randolph, the attorney general for <b>the</b> <b>territory,</b> and John Johnson, a Vincennes native who {{had the support of}} the antislavery group. Randolph promised not to introduce slavery into <b>the</b> <b>territory</b> unless the majority of his constituents agreed, while Johnson remained silent on the issue. Jennings, an antislavery candidate from the eastern portion of <b>the</b> <b>territory,</b> rode from settlement to settlement to give speeches against slavery. Jennings spoke against what he believed to be Randolph's aristocratic tendencies, ties to Harrison's territorial government, and the issue of slavery in <b>the</b> <b>territory.</b> Jennings found his greatest support among the growing Quaker community {{in the eastern part of}} <b>the</b> <b>territory.</b>|$|E

5|$|The first Governor of <b>the</b> <b>Territory</b> was William Henry Harrison. Harrison County {{was named}} in his honor; he gained {{national}} fame during his term {{as a hero}} of the Battle of Tippecanoe. He later became the ninth President of the United States. Harrison served as governor from May 13, 1800 to December 28, 1812. Harrison did not arrive in <b>the</b> <b>territory</b> to begin governing until January 1801. John Gibson, the Territorial Secretary, served as acting governor, from the creation of <b>the</b> <b>territory</b> until his arrival.

At the outbreak of Tecumseh's War, <b>the</b> <b>territory</b> {{was on the front}} line of battle and Harrison led a military force in the opening hostilities at the Battle of Tippecanoe, and then in the subsequent invasion of Canada during the War of 1812. Thomas Posey was appointed to the vacant governorship, but the opposition party, led by Congressman Jonathan Jennings, had dominance in the territorial affairs for its remaining years and began pressing for statehood. In June 1816, a constitutional convention was held and a state government was formed. <b>The</b> <b>territory</b> was dissolved on December 11, 1816, by an act of Congress granting statehood to Indiana.|$|E

5|$|As the {{population}} of <b>the</b> <b>territory</b> grew, so did the people's exercising of their freedoms. In 1809, <b>the</b> <b>territory</b> was granted permission to fully elect its own legislature for the first time. Before that, Governor Harrison appointed the legislature. Although Article 6 of the Northwest Ordinance had prohibited slavery, it had existed in the region since French rule. In addition, settlers from the Upper South occupied areas along the Ohio River, bringing slaves with them. They wanted to have it be legal in <b>the</b> <b>territory,</b> but others from the northern states opposed the expansion of slavery into this region. The anti-slavery party won a strong majority in the first election. Governor Harrison was {{at odds with the}} new legislature, which proceeded to overturn the indenturing and pro-slavery laws he had enacted. Slavery remained the defining issue in the state for the decades to follow. In these early decades, although the legislature did not encourage free blacks to settle here, it extended suffrage to them.|$|E
