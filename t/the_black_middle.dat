It was found that moderately high levels of self-consciousness and health consciousness exist among respondents.

25|$|For many years, Compton {{was a much}} sought-after suburb for <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>middle</b> {{class of}} Los Angeles. This past affluence is {{reflected}} in the area's appearance—Compton's streets are lined with relatively spacious and attractive single family houses. However, several factors have contributed to Compton's gradual decline. One of the most significant factors was a steady erosion of its tax base, something that was already sparse due to limited commercial properties. In later years, there were middle-class whites who fled to the newly incorporated cities of Artesia, Bellflower, Cerritos, Paramount and Norwalk in the late 1950s. These nearby communities remained largely white early on despite integration. This white middle class flight accelerated following the 1965 Watts Riots and the 1992 Los Angeles riots.|$|E

2500|$|Detroit {{had one of}} {{the largest}} Model Cities projects. Mayor Jerome Cavanagh (Mayor 1962—69) was the only elected {{official}} to serve on Johnson's task force. Detroit received widespread acclaim for its leadership in the program, which used $490 million to try to turn a nine-square-mile section of the city (with 134,000 inhabitants) into a model city. [...] The city's political and business elite, and city planners, along with <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>middle</b> class, wanted the federal funding to assist the economic growth of the entire city. They sought to protect the central business district property values from nearby slums and to construct new revenue-generating structures. But, local community organizers and civil rights activists rallied poor residents in opposition to these plans. They said federal renewal funding should be used to replace deteriorating housing stock, whether with new public housing or low-cost housing built by private developers. The Model City program was terminated in Detroit and nationwide in 1974 after major race riots in in the late 1960s most of its target cities.|$|E

Of the 30,000 drug addicts then estimated to live in New York City, 15,000 to 20,000 lived in Harlem. Property crime was pervasive, and the murder rate was six times higher than New York's average. Half of the children in Harlem grew up with one parent, or none, and lack of supervision contributed to juvenile delinquency; between 1953 and 1962, the crime rate among young people increased throughout New York City, but was consistently 50% higher in Harlem than in New York City as a whole.|$|E
2500|$|Womanist {{literature}} and activism are two {{areas that are}} largely interpolated, with each having a considerable effect on the other. A major tenet of Womanist {{literature and}} activism {{is the idea that}} Black activists and Black authors should separate themselves from the feminist ideology. This stems from assertions by Kalenda Eaton, Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi, and numerous other Womanist theologians that the goal of a Womanist should be to promote the issues affecting not just Black women, but black men and other groups that have been subjected to discrimination or impotence. In the words of Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi, a white woman writer may be a Feminist, but a black woman writer {{is likely to be a}} Womanist. That is, she recognizes that along with battling for sexual equality, she must also incorporate race, economics, culture, and politics within her philosophy. In Kalenda Eaton's, Womanism, Literature and the Black Community, black women writers are portrayed as both activists and visionaries for change in the Black Community following the Civil Rights Movement. She interweaves the historical events of African-American history with the development of Afro-Politico Womanism in a bid to create a haven for Black female activism within the black community. This Afro-Politico Womanism veers from the traditional feminist goal of gender equality within a group and rather seeks to fight for the men and women whose civil rights are infringed upon. While Eaton takes the stance that Black women were largely excluded from the more prominent positions within the Black Movement, she argues that black women activists had the greatest effect in small-scale grassroots protests within their communities. Using various characters from Toni Morrison's Song of Solomon, Alice Walker's Meridian, Toni Cade Bambara's The Salt Eaters, and Paule Marshall's The Chosen Place, the Timeless People as symbols of the various political agendas and issues that were prevalent within The Black Movement, Eaton draws upon the actions of the protagonists to illustrate solutions to the problems of disgruntlement and disorganization within the movement. [...] Often the main task of these literary activists was to empower the impoverished masses—defined by Eaton as mainly Southern African-Americans, and they used <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>middle</b> class as a model for the possibility of social mobility within the African-American community. A common theme within Womanist literature is the failure of Black women writers to identify with feminist thought. Womanism becomes the concept that binds these novelists together.|$|E

40|$|The {{intent of}} this study was to explore <b>the</b> {{perceptions}} of <b>Black</b> <b>middle</b> and upper class preservice teachers as they relate to teaching and learning in high poverty urban schools. Participants included 11 senior early childhood education preservice teachers at a historically <b>Black</b> college in <b>the</b> southeast region of the United States. The study was conducted using qualitative inquiry. Background questionnaires, individual interviews, and a group interview served as the data sources. While there is an extensive body of knowledge focused on the increasing number of White preservice teachers who lack experience with students in diverse communities, there are limited studies pertaining to <b>the</b> perceptions of <b>Black</b> <b>middle</b> and upper class preservice teachers who may lack experience with students in high poverty urban schools. In <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community, color and social class have been inexorably linked for generations. Social class is conceivably one of the most significant sources of inequality in schools and was one of the first factors, after intelligence, researched by scholars as a source of difference in achievement. The study answered the following questions: (1) What are <b>the</b> perceptions of <b>Black</b> <b>middle</b> and upper class preservice teachers regarding teaching and learning in high poverty urban schools? (2) To what extent do <b>Black</b> <b>middle</b> and upper class preservice teachers believe they can be successful teachers in high poverty urban schools? The data demonstrated that <b>Black</b> <b>middle</b> and upper class preservice teachers (a) prefer to teach in communities similar to their own school experiences; (b) believe students from high poverty urban schools can achieve at the same level as students in middle and upper class schools, but are uncertain of the value their informal knowledge brings to the classroom; (c) recognize effective teaching strategies and best practices in classroom instruction; and (d) have mixed feelings regarding their ability to connect with students and parents in high poverty urban schools. Implications from the study include expanding the scope of field experiences for <b>Black</b> <b>middle</b> and upper class preservice teachers in high poverty urban schools and recognizing <b>Black</b> <b>middle</b> and upper class preservice teachers in teacher education research...|$|R

The results of the model confirmed the presence of bandwagon luxury motor vehicle consumption among this market segment.
