5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Arthur Dales, now living in a Florida trailer park, calls Mulder and Scully for help when a neighboring family disappears; and, with a hurricane approaching, Mulder and Scully find themselves trapped {{with a group of}} residents in a building where <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> the water.|$|E
500|$|Yagan asked Moore whether Midgegooroo {{was dead}} or alive. Moore gave no reply, but a servant {{answered}} that Midgegooroo {{was a prisoner}} on Carnac Island. Yagan warned, [...] "White man shoot Midgegooroo, Yagan kill three." [...] Moore reported the encounter but {{made no attempt to}} restrain Yagan. He later wrote, [...] "The truth is, every one wishes him taken, but no one likes to be the captor... <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> his daring which one is forced to admire." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Katy {{is initially}} hired to babysit, though {{it turns out}} that there is no baby. Previous horror films, including When a Stranger Calls, have made use of a babysitter as a plot device, and an urban legend involves a babysitter downstairs with a threat upstairs. Both the viewer and the babysitter learn about the environment together, with both beginning in a position of ignorance. For Pemberton, the device works because the character has been moved from a safe environment into the unknown. In [...] "The Harrowing", he suggests, it is obvious that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> the bedroom. The writers experimented with different endings, in an attempt to make the bedroom's contents interesting and genuinely scary.|$|E

500|$|The {{style of}} Uematsu's {{compositions}} is diverse, ranging from stately classical symphonic pieces and heavy metal to new-age and hyper-percussive techno-electronica. For example, in Lost Odyssey, the score ranges from classical orchestral arrangements to contemporary jazz and techno tracks. Uematsu {{has stated that}} he is a big fan of Celtic and Irish music, and some of his work contains elements from these musical styles. Uematsu's Final Fantasy scores vary from upbeat, to dark and angry, to melancholic in nature. For instance, the music of Final Fantasy VIII is dark and gloomy, while the soundtrack to Final Fantasy IX is more carefree and upbeat. His Final Fantasy music has been described as being able to convey the true emotion of a scene; an example is [...] "Aerith's Theme" [...] from Final Fantasy VII. In an interview with the Nichi Bei Times, Uematsu said [...] "I don't really self-consciously compose music for Japan or for the world, but I do think <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> my more melancholy pieces that has a distinctly Japanese quality." [...] He has been named one of the [...] "Innovators" [...] in Time Magazines [...] "Time 100: The Next Wave — Music" [...] feature. He has also been called the [...] "John Williams of the video game world" [...] and been credited for [...] "increasing the appreciation and awareness" [...] of video game music.|$|E
500|$|Immanuel Kant, {{a central}} figure of the Age of Enlightenment, {{likewise}} claimed that two things filled his mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the oftener and more steadily they were reflected on: [...] "the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me... the latter begins from my invisible self, my personality, and exhibits me in a world which has true infinity but which I recognise myself as existing in a universal and necessary (and not only, as in the first case, contingent) connection." [...] The 'universal connection' referred to here is Kant's categorical imperative: [...] "act only according to that maxim by which you can {{at the same time}} will that it should become a universal law." [...] Kant considered critical conscience to be an internal court in which our thoughts accuse or excuse one another; he acknowledged that morally mature people do often describe contentment or peace in the soul after following conscience to perform a duty, but argued that for such acts to produce virtue their primary motivation should simply be duty, not expectation of any such bliss. Rousseau expressed a similar view that conscience somehow connected man to a greater metaphysical unity. John Plamenatz in his critical examination of Rousseau's work considered that conscience was there defined as the feeling that urges us, in spite of contrary passions, towards two harmonies: the one within our minds and between our passions, and the other within society and between its members; [...] "the weakest can appeal to it in the strongest, and the appeal, though often unsuccessful, is always disturbing. However, corrupted by power or wealth we may be, either as possessors of them or as victims, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> us serving to remind us that this corruption is against nature." ...|$|E
2500|$|Middleton Place, home to America's Oldest Landscaped Gardens, {{was named}} [...] "the most {{important}} and most interesting garden in America". [...] It is home to camellias that are hundreds of years old and hills of azaleas. [...] It was planned so that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> bloom year-round. [...] The house was built in 1755, and was home to four generations of the Middleton Family. [...] It still holds their exquisite furniture, and decorations. [...] The same family has held ownership of the property for more than 320 years, and successfully keeps it in good condition so that visitors can appreciate its significance.|$|E

2500|$|At this point, Fox whispered {{that there}} was [...] "no loss of friendship". [...] "I regret to say there is", Burke replied, [...] "I have indeed made a great sacrifice; I have done my duty though I have lost my friend. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> the detested French {{constitution}} that envenoms every thing it touches". This provoked a reply from Fox, yet {{he was unable to}} give his speech for some time since he was overcome with tears and emotion, he appealed to Burke to remember their inalienable friendship, but also repeated his criticisms of Burke and uttered [...] "unusually bitter sarcasms". This only aggravated the rupture between the two men. Burke demonstrated his separation from the party on 5 June 1791 by writing to Fitzwilliam, declining money from him.|$|E
2500|$|The philosopher, if {{he loves}} true wisdom {{and not the}} passions and appetites of the body, accepts that he can come closest to true {{knowledge}} and wisdom in death, as {{he is no longer}} confused by the body and the senses. In life, the rational and intelligent functions of the soul are restricted by bodily senses of pleasure, pain, sight, and sound. [...] Death, however, is a rite of purification from the [...] "infection" [...] of the body. As the philosopher practices death his entire life, he should greet it amicably and not be discouraged upon its arrival, for, since the universe the Gods created for us in life is essentially [...] "good," [...] why would death be anything but a continuation of this goodness? Death is a place where better and wiser Gods rule and where the most noble souls exist: [...] "And therefore, so far as that is concerned, I not only do not grieve, but I have great hopes that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> store for the dead..., something better for the good than for the wicked." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aware of Blake's visions, William Wordsworth commented, [...] "There was {{no doubt}} that this poor man was mad, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> the madness of this man which {{interests}} me more than the sanity of Lord Byron and Walter Scott." [...] In a more deferential vein, writing in A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature, John William Cousins wrote that Blake was [...] "a truly pious and loving soul, neglected and misunderstood by the world, but appreciated by an elect few", who [...] "led a cheerful and contented life of poverty illumined by visions and celestial inspirations". Blake's sanity was called into question {{as recently as the}} publication of the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, whose entry on Blake comments that [...] "the question whether Blake was or was not mad seems likely to remain in dispute, but {{there can be no doubt}} whatever that he was at different periods of his life under the influence of illusions for which there are no outward facts to account, and that much of what he wrote is so far wanting in the quality of sanity as to be without a logical coherence".|$|E

2500|$|Eliot's {{childhood}} {{infatuation with}} literature can be ascribed to several factors. Firstly, {{he had to}} overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double inguinal hernia, he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socializing with his peers. As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed with books and was absorbed in tales depicting savages, the Wild West, or Mark Twain's thrill-seeking Tom Sawyer. In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot [...] "would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living." [...] Secondly, Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision: [...] "It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I feel that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> having passed one's childhood beside the big river, which is incommunicable {{to those people who}} have not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{theme of}} country versus city symbolises {{that which is}} natural and life-renewing over against the {{artificial}} and corrupting effects of society. In the stargazing scene in Book I, the starlight symbolises one's capacity to transcend selfish preoccupations and the suffering they cause, over against the candlelight, suggesting small-minded concerns. Another theme of the novel was need to uphold traditional English values and religion against the atheist values of the French Revolution. The character of Mary Crawford whose [...] "French" [...] irreverence had caused her to cease attending church is unfavourably contrasted with that of Fanny Price whose [...] "English" [...] sobriety and faith leads her to proclaim that church services should continue as [...] "It was a valuable part of former times. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house, with one's idea of what such a household should be!". Austen presents the Church of England as a force for stability that holds together family, customs and English traditions in contrast to Crawford whose {{lack of interest in}} religion makes her an alien and disruptive force in the English countryside.|$|E
2500|$|Cleopatra is a {{difficult}} character to pin down because there are multiple aspects of her personality that we occasionally get a glimpse of. However, the most dominant parts of her character seem to oscillate between a powerful ruler, a seductress, and a heroine of sorts. Power is one of Cleopatra's most dominant character traits and she uses it {{as a means of}} control. This thirst for control manifested itself through Cleopatra's initial seduction of Antony in which she was dressed as Aphrodite, the goddess of love, and made quite a calculated entrance in order to capture his attention. This sexualised act extends itself into Cleopatra's role as a seductress because it was her courage and unapologetic manner that leaves people remembering her as a [...] "grasping, licentious harlot". However, despite her [...] "insatiable sexual passion" [...] she was still using these relationships as part of a grander political scheme, once again revealing how dominant Cleopatra's desire was for power. Due to Cleopatra's close relationship with power, she seems to take on the role of a heroine because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> her passion and intelligence that intrigues others. She was an autonomous and confident ruler, sending a powerful message about the independence and strength of women. Cleopatra had quite a wide influence, and still continues to inspire, making her a heroine to many.|$|E

2500|$|Hume elaborates more on {{this last}} {{principle}} of cause and effect. When a person observes that one object or event consistently produces the same object or event, it results in “an expectation that a particular event (a ‘cause’) {{will be followed by}} another event (an ‘effect’) previously and constantly associated with it." [...] Hume calls this principle custom, or habit, saying that “custom…renders our experience useful to us, and makes us expect, for the future, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in the past." [...] However, even though custom can serve as a guide in life, it still only represents an expectation. In other words, “experience cannot establish a necessary connection between cause and effect, because we can imagine without contradiction a case where the cause does not produce its usual effect…the reason why we mistakenly infer that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> the cause that necessarily produces its effect is because our past experiences have habituated us to think in this way." [...] Continuing this idea, Hume argues that “only in the pure realm of ideas, logic, and mathematics, not contingent on the direct sense awareness of reality, [...] causation safely…be applied – all other sciences are reduced to probability." [...] He uses this skepticism to reject metaphysics and many theological views on the basis that they are not grounded in fact and observations, and are therefore beyond the reach of human understanding.|$|E
2500|$|The idea of atonement for sin is {{criticized by}} Richard Dawkins {{on the grounds}} that the image of God as {{requiring}} the suffering and death of Jesus to effect reconciliation with humankind is immoral. The view is summarized by Dawkins: [...] "if God wanted to forgive our sins, why not just forgive them? Who is God trying to impress?" [...] Oxford theologian Alister McGrath maintains that Dawkins is [...] "ignorant" [...] of Christian theology, and therefore unable to engage religion and faith intelligently. He goes on to say that the atonement was necessary because of our flawed human nature, which made it impossible for us to save ourselves, and that it expresses God's love for us by removing the sin that stands in the way of our reconciliation with God. Responding to the criticism that he is [...] "ignorant" [...] of theology, Dawkins asks, [...] "Do you have to read up on leprechology before disbelieving in leprechauns?" [...] and [...] "es, I have, of course, met this point before. It sounds superficially fair. But it presupposes that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> Christian theology to be ignorant about. The entire thrust of my position is that Christian theology is a non-subject." [...] Dinesh D'Souza says that Dawkins' criticism [...] "only makes sense if you assume Christians made the whole thing up." [...] He goes on to say that Christians view it as a beautiful sacrifice, and that [...] "through the extremity of Golgotha, Christ reconciles divine justice and divine mercy." [...] Andrew Wilson argues that Dawkins misses the point of the atonement, which has nothing to do with masochism, but is based on the concepts of holiness, sin and grace.|$|E
