5|$|D.O.-granting U.S. {{medical schools}} have {{curricula}} identical {{for the most}} part to those of M.D.-granting schools. Generally, the first two years are classroom-based, while the <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>years</b> consist of clinical rotations through the major specialties of medicine. Some schools of Osteopathic Medicine have been criticized by the osteopathic community for relying too heavily on clinical rotations with private practitioners, who {{may not be able to}} provide sufficient instruction to the rotating student. Other D.O.-granting and M.D.-granting schools place their students in hospital-based clinical rotations where the attending physicians are faculty of the school, and who have a clear duty to teach medical students while treating patients.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, Burke {{signed a}} maximum rookie contract—120 {{percent of the}} preset salary scale of $2,032,300—with the Jazz, {{resulting}} in a contract worth in $4,987,320 guaranteed salary for his first two seasons, while the Jazz have team option rights for the <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>years.</b> This {{cleared the way for}} Burke to participate in the July 7–12 Orlando Summer League. At point guard, the Jazz had traded Randy Foye and were negotiating with Mo Williams. In the NBA Summer League, Trey Burke shot at 24 percent from the field, including 1–19 on three-point shots, while trying to adjust to the pace of the NBA game. He was even benched for a game. Following Burke's Summer League performance, the Jazz signed John Lucas III.|$|E
25|$|The {{business}} {{school and the}} UM School of Medicine offer a joint MD/MBA degree program to prepare future physicians for the business aspects of managing a medical practice, as well as prepare medical students for careers in health sector management, leadership and policy.

25|$|Vocational schools offer {{a higher}} {{concentration}} of technical and vocational subjects {{in addition to}} the core academic subjects studied by students at general high schools. These schools tend to offer technical and vocational instruction in one of five main fields: agriculture, fisheries, trade-technical, home industry, and ‘non-traditional’ courses while offering a host of specializations. During the first two years, students study a general vocational area, from the five main fields mentioned. During the <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>years</b> they specialize in a discipline or vocation within that area. Programs contain a mixture of theory and practice.|$|E
25|$|First Year Orientation Period, (FYOP) is {{the most}} {{demanding}} challenge many cadets will face during their time at the college. FYOP takes place during {{the first month of}} the academic year following the completion of the first mod of BMOQ. Prior to the 2015-2016 academic year, cadets would attend 2 week program called recruit camp in which cadets would undergo some basic military training before entering the college. With newly hired cadets completing half of their BMOQ before attending RMC, recruit camp is no longer necessary. FYOP is like Frosh week at civilian universities, except it lasts four weeks and cadets are placed under extreme stress for nearly the entire duration. FYOP begins with the Arch parade where the entire First Year class is marched onto College grounds by their FYOP staff consisting of <b>Third</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fourth</b> <b>Years.</b>|$|E
25|$|Evidence that Amenmesse was {{a direct}} {{contemporary}} with Seti II's rulemdash&rather than Seti II's immediate predecessor mdash&includes the fact that Seti II's royal KV15 tomb at Thebes was deliberately vandalised with many of Seti's royal names being carefully erased here during his reign., JEA 85 (1999), pp.136-38 The erasures were subsequently repaired by Seti II's agents. This suggests that Seti II's reign at Thebes was interrupted {{by the rise of}} a rival: king Amenmesse in Upper Egypt. Secondly, the German scholar Wolfgang Helck has shown that Amenmesse is only attested in Upper Egypt by several Year 3 and a single Year 4 ostracas; Helck also noted that no Year 1 or Year 2 ostracas from Deir El Medina could legitimately be assigned to Amenmesse's reign. This conforms well with the clear evidence of Seti II's control over Thebes in his first two years, which is attested by various documents and papyri. In contrast, Seti II is absent from Upper Egypt during his <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>years</b> which are notably unattested—presumably because Amenmesse controlled this region during this time.|$|E

50|$|After Hoesli {{questioned}} the <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>year</b> design class practices he’d seen from other faculty, {{he made the}} decision to teach the third year design course with Paul Hofer. After the two collaborated on the course curriculum for that first year (1978/1979) Hoesli took over the design course. The course for the <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>year</b> was not divided into semester work, but rather consisted of a single project for those years. This project, called the Venice Project, was a housing unit for an urban setting, specifically the Cannaregio district in Venice, and contained six sections in its program.|$|R
25|$|Many authors {{note the}} most obvious {{difference}} between the curricula of DO and MD schools is osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM), a form of hands-on care used to diagnose, treat and prevent illness or injury and is taught only at DO schools. As of 2006, the average osteopathic student spent almost 8 weeks on clerkships for OMM during their <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>years.</b> The National Institute of Health's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health states that overall, {{studies have shown that}} spinal manipulation can provide mild-to-moderate relief from low-back pain and appears to be as effective as conventional medical treatments. In 2007 guidelines, the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society include spinal manipulation as one of several treatment options for practitioners to consider using when pain does not improve with self-care. Spinal manipulation is generally a safe treatment for low-back pain. Serious complications are very rare. A 2001 survey of DOs found that more than 50% of the respondents used OMT (osteopathic manipulative treatment) on less than 5% of their patients. The survey was the latest indication that DOs have become more like MD physicians in all respects: fewer perform OMT, more prescribe drugs, and many perform surgery as a first option. One area which has been implicated, but not been formally studied regarding the decline in OMT usage among DOs in practice, is the role of reimbursement changes. Only {{in the last several years}} could a DO charge for both an office visit (Evaluation & Management services) and use a procedure (CPT) code when performing OMT; previously, it was bundled.|$|E
2500|$|The first-year {{courses are}} {{organized}} around {{basic principles of}} counseling.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th century, {{educational}} {{leaders such as}} William R.
