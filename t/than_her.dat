5|$|Angelou {{does not}} begin to create her own {{narrative}} until The Heart of a Woman, which depends less upon the conventions of fiction <b>than</b> <b>her</b> previous books. For example, there is less dialog and fewer dramatic episodes. The Heart of a Woman is more uplifting than its predecessors due to Angelou's resolution of her conflict between her duties as {{a mother and her}} success as a performer.|$|E
5|$|Born on October 8, 1895, in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, to John Gibson Smith and Hester Sims, Marion Isabelle Sims Smith was the {{youngest}} of seven children. Little is known about her childhood, other <b>than</b> <b>her</b> father died before her birth. She attended the Latter-day Saints University and Normal School at the University of Utah. Spafford went on to teach in Salt Lake City schools.|$|E

5|$|Debut {{received}} widespread {{critical acclaim}} from British music critics, though United States reviewers doled out more mixed reviews. Upon its initial release, the album sold far greater <b>than</b> <b>her</b> label predicted, charting at number {{three in the}} United Kingdom and 61 in the United States. It was certified gold in Canada and platinum in the United States, where it remains her best-selling album to date.|$|E
5|$|During her premiership Thatcher had the second-lowest average {{approval}} rating (40%) of any post-war Prime Minister. Since {{the resignation of}} Nigel Lawson as Chancellor in 1989, polls consistently showed that she was less popular <b>than</b> <b>her</b> party. A self-described conviction politician, Thatcher always insisted {{that she did not}} care about her poll ratings and pointed instead to her unbeaten election record.|$|E
5|$|In The Orphant Annie Story Book (1921), author Johnny Gruelle augments the character’s {{background}} story {{and goes to}} great lengths to soften her image, portraying her as telling pleasant tales of fairies, gnomes and anthropomorphic animals rather <b>than</b> <b>her</b> characteristic horror stories.|$|E

5|$|She also {{researched}} the book more <b>than</b> <b>her</b> others. By assuming {{the responsibilities of}} fiction editor and reviewing almost nothing but novels, she used her editorial position at Joseph Johnson's Analytical Review to educate herself regarding novelistic techniques. She even visited Bedlam Hospital in February 1797 to research insane asylums.|$|E
5|$|She {{was better}} known <b>than</b> <b>her</b> three sisters during her {{lifetime}} and headed Red Cross committees during World War I. Like {{her older sister}} Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia, she nursed wounded soldiers in a military hospital from 1914 to 1917, until the family was arrested following the first Russian Revolution of 1917.|$|E
5|$|Stephen married Gisela, a {{daughter}} of Duke Henry the Wrangler of Bavaria, who was a nephew of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor.

5|$|A {{contract}} {{to build the}} ship that would become Agincourt was signed on 3June 1911, and its keel was laid on 14September 1911. The design called for a staggering fourteen 12-inch guns, something historian David Topliss attributed to political necessity: the ship had to appear more powerful to the Brazilian populace <b>than</b> <b>her</b> predecessors (with twelve 12-inch guns) but, without increasing the gun size, the only option left was increasing {{the total number of}} guns.|$|E

5|$|After {{many years}} of ambitious and {{successful}} free-lance acting, Bosse found her options narrowing in the 1930s. The Great Depression brought her economic hardship, and, even though she looked younger <b>than</b> <b>her</b> age, most important women's roles were out of her age range. Her technique was still often praised, but also sometimes perceived as old-fashioned and mannered, {{in comparison with the}} more ensemble-oriented style of the times. Finding herself unneeded by any Swedish repertory theatre, she only managed to return as a member of Dramaten by means of skillful persuasion and pointed reminders of her long history there. A humble employee at a humble salary, she played only fifteen roles, all minor, during her last ten years at Dramaten, 1933–43.|$|E
5|$|After {{recording}} several {{songs for}} her movie soundtracks, Lohan signed with Casablanca Records. Lohan's debut studio album, titled Speak, {{was released in}} December 2004 {{and became the first}} high-seller from Casablanca in several years, selling 1 million copies in the United States alone and peaking at number four on the Billboard 200. Though the album received mostly lukewarm reviews, it was certified platinum and sold over 4 million copies worldwide. Lohan's second album, titled A Little More Personal (Raw), was released in December 2005 and featured darker material <b>than</b> <b>her</b> debut had. The album received mixed reviews, and it was certified gold.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympics, Crapp and Fraser took a {{break from}} {{competitive}} swimming, while Leech retired. This allowed Morgan an opening, and she won both the junior and open sprint titles at the 1957 New South Wales Championships. She followed this by winning three individual titles at the Australian Championships in Canberra: the 110-, 220- and 440-yard freestyle, in times of 1 minute 7.8 seconds; 2 minutes 29.3 seconds; and 5 minutes 21.6 seconds, respectively. Her times were slower <b>than</b> <b>her</b> bests in 1956. She {{was part of the}} New South Wales team that won the 4×100-yard freestyle and medley relays, anchoring both quartets.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of her parents in 1890, Bonstelle went to New York City, and in 1891 she joined the company of Fanny Janauschek, with whom she toured for a season. In 1892 she worked as an {{understudy}} and chorus member in Augustin Daly's company, but the season left her exhausted. However, in 1893 she married the actor Alexander Hamilton Stuart, who was twenty years older <b>than</b> <b>her</b> and Janauschek's leading man. Happily married, together they worked in Philadelphia's Forepaugh Stock Company for two years, before moving to Rochester, where Bonstelle played various roles and became an established leading lady. She was the leading lady of Philadelphia's Standard Stock Company during the 1898–99 season. Stuart died in 1911; Bonstelle would never remarry.|$|E
5|$|Although {{she writes}} under the pen name J. K. Rowling (pronounced rolling), her name, before her remarriage, was simply Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target {{audience}} of young boys {{might not want to}} read a book written by a woman, her publishers asked that she use two initials rather <b>than</b> <b>her</b> full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother. She calls herself Jo. Following her remarriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of Joanne Kathleen Rowling and her entry in Who's Who lists her name also as Joanne Kathleen Rowling.|$|E
5|$|Anna Gardner (Felicity Jones), a British {{exchange}} student attending college in Los Angeles, meets and {{falls in love}} with Jacob Helm (Anton Yelchin), an American student who returns her affections. After graduation, Anna decides to spend the summer with Jacob rather than return to the United Kingdom, unaware of the consequences of staying longer <b>than</b> <b>her</b> student visa, which expired upon her graduation, allows. After returning to London for a family engagement, Anna flies back to Los Angeles, where she is detained, denied entry, and sent back to the United Kingdom by immigration officials.|$|E
