Although the agriculture activities has been introduced for a long time, the subsistens agriculture has still dominated in the Arfak Tribal Group agriculture system. In their agriculture activities, the new innovation has been adopted for a short time. The new innovation on agricultural system has been considered as a disturbance of their conservative norms. But this theory disagreed by Boef et al. (1993 : 206) as noted that the conservative system is not the cause but the top down agriculture program which contradicted with the local wisdoms. This research is aimed to: to find the knowledge system and the local technology of Arfak people, and identify the social culture values (norms, traditional system, custom) both the supporting and the obstructing the farm of Arfak people.

40|$|A CMOS {{photodetector}} array with in-pixel electronics {{has been}} developed for computed tomography (CT) applications. Current CT detectors are based on two discrete components: a photodiode array and a data acquisition system (amplifier). Both elements have <b>to</b> <b>fullfill</b> a series of severe requirements. CT scanners are moving toward larger detectors and higher speed, and yet lowering costs and improving performance. This contribution relates to the integration of both elements into a standard CMOS process <b>to</b> <b>fullfill</b> future CT scanner specifications and for a cost-effective solution. A series of limitations have been overcome to integrate both the photodiode and a charge-sensing amplifier at pixel level. In order to balance the limited responsitivity of standard CMOS photodiodes, a new low-capacitance device has been devised so that low-noise design is possible while providing enough gain in the amplifier.

The competetiveness calls for a strategy to find advantages in the employment process. The strategy explored in this thesis is called personal branding. We believe that by building a strong personal brand you can increase the possibilities to influence the decisions of those responsible for recruitments in our society. The question we ask ourselves in this essay is {{how to build a}} personal brand with the power to give students a competetive advantage in the employment process. To find out what elements of a personal brand that may be important in this respect we have interviewed ten recruiting specialist. We wanted their personal opinions on what they consider to be of importance in the search for jobs, the application papers and during the interviews. By matching these opinions with earlier research on personal branding we have developed a guiding manual that will help young univeristy graduates building their own individual personal brand with the purpose to advance in an employment process.

40|$|The {{paper will}} {{describe}} {{new methods of}} graphical robot simulation and control by using Virtual Reality techniques. The objectives of the research work at IPA Stuttgart are to improve the man-machine-interface to robot simulation systems and to robot control systems. Therefore a suitable testbed was developed to evaluate simulation concepts for industrial robots such as off-line programming, off-line teaching and robot teleoperation. In this test surrounding, the operator wearing a headmounted stereo display is able {{to act in a}} virtual world. The movements of head and hand are tracked by sensors and included in the simulation in realtime. By means of gestures with the dataglove and control commands given by a 6 D-sensorball, the operator can move within the virtual world without having to leave his real location. Using the dataglove the operators hand movements can directly be converted into robot path data for a virtual robot. Moreover an interface towards the real robot enables the ope rator's movements to be directly transferred to the industrial robot (PUMA 560 with VAL II) via dataglove. In this way any path in all 6 degrees of freedom can be generated in realtime. Conventional teachpanels and time consuming path programming of the robot are unnecessary. Different to conventional graphical simulations, high requirements to the rendering system performance have <b>to</b> be <b>fullfilled.</b> This adresses especially the frame rate of such a simulation system, e. g. 15 pictures per second have to be achieved to perform a dynamic impression of the virtual world.

40|$|Background: Today, {{patients}} often {{expect to}} achieve spectacle independance after cataract surgery. New trifocal intraocular lenses {{have been developed}} <b>to</b> try and <b>fullfill</b> this demand. The {{purpose of this study}} is to report the short-term visual outcomes of a new trifocal intraocular lens (AcrySof PanOptix™). Methods: Consecutive adult patients undergoing cataract surgery with bilateral implantation of the study intraocular lens in a private practice clinic were considered for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were the presence of other ocular pathologies or preoperative astigmatism > 1. 5 diopters (D). Patients with intraoperative complications were excluded from analysis. One month after surgery patients underwent: monocular defocus curve; monocular and binocular uncorrected visual acuity in photopic and mesopic conditions, for far (4 m), intermediate (60 cm) and near (33 cm) distances and binocular contrast sensitivity. Patients completed a visual satisfaction questionnaire between 9 and 12 months after surgery. Results: One hundred and sixteen eyes of fifty-eight patients receiving bilateral implantation of the study intraocular lens were analysed. Mean binocular uncorrected visual acuity in photopic conditions was 0. 03 LogMAR for far, 0. 12 for intermediate and 0. 02 for near distances. All patients achieved a binocular uncorrected visual acuity better than 0. 3 LogMAR (20 / 40 Snellen equivalent) for distance and near vision and 94. 8 % of patients for intermediate vision. Mesopic binocular uncorrected visual acuity values were similar to photopic values. The monocular defocus curves showed that the best visual acuity was reached at a vergence of 0. 00 D. Visual acuity dropped slightly at − 1. 00 D and peaked again at − 2. 00 D. Visual acuities better than 0. 2 LogMAR were maintained between − 2. 50 D and + 0. 50 D. Contrast sensitivity was high and similar in photopic and mesopic conditions. As regards patient-evaluated outcomes, only 2 patients (3. 4 %) were fairly dissatisfied with their sight after surgery. Three patients (5. 1 %) reported the need for spectacle correction for certain activities. All other patients (94. 8 %) reported never using spectacle correction. Conclusions: The PanOptix trifocal IOL provides good short-term visual outcomes, with good intermediate performance and excellent patient-reported satisfaction. The similar values achieved in mesopic and photopic conditions in binocular uncorrected visual acuity and contrast sensitivity suggest low pupillary dependence for light distribution.
