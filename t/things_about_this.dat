25|$|A {{frequent}} {{critique of}} the discipline is that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychology are frequently arbitrary and difficult or impossible to adequately test, thus questioning its status as an actual scientific discipline, for example because many current traits probably evolved to serve different functions than they do now. While evolutionary psychology hypotheses are difficult to test, evolutionary psychologists assert {{that it is not}} impossible. Part of the {{critique of the}} scientific base of evolutionary psychology includes a critique of the concept of the Environments of Evolutionary Adaptation. Some critics have argued that researchers know so little about the environment in which Homo sapiens evolved that explaining specific traits as an adaption to that environment becomes highly speculative. Evolutionary psychologists respond that they do know many <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> environment, including the facts that present day humans' ancestors were hunter-gatherers, that they generally lived in small tribes, etc.|$|E

[...] "One of the best (worst) <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> module is that Acererak the demi-lich is a huge asshole. He's an asshole for filling his tomb with traps AND treasure, he's an asshole because he leaves little messages throughout his tomb bragging about how he's going to kill the players." ...|$|E

Lutz (John Lutz)—the staff writers of the fictitious show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS)—were going to be seen more in the upcoming season, to which he replied, [...] "One of the great <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> show and the blessing and the curse {{is that we have}} so many characters and so many different interactions between characters that work so well.

Extra features added to the release included another a cappella version of [...] "Born This Way" [...] which was performed on stage unlike {{the one in the}} closing credits. A photo gallery was also included as well as backstage footage showing Gaga meeting with actress Liza Minnelli. According to Jeffrey Kauffman of Blu-ray.com, the audio tracks were commendable for their crisp sound. He stated that [...] "One of the best <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> concert is despite its artifice, even its artificiality, there's absolutely no question that Lady Gaga is actually singing. What a novel idea for a live concert, and one that seemed especially refreshing after having just sat through the [...] concert Blu-ray, where Brit's live voice was all but buried in the pre-records." ...|$|E

[...] In addition, Carlock noted that it is always [...] "fun" [...] when the writers and Jenna [...] "are scheming off each other" [...] as featured in this episode.|$|E

500|$|S. R. Praveen of The Hindu gave a {{positive}} review: [...] "Syam Pushkaran, {{in writing the}} revenge story, takes away the usual ingredients of hate and anger, and replaces it with lots of humour, arriving as a torrent in one-liners, in situations {{and even in the}} minute gestures of the characters ... Maheshinte Prathikaram provides clean entertainment, treading new paths in that endeavour. If revenge comes like this, let's have more of it". He praised Pothan's direction and Faasil's performance. Sify also had {{a positive}} review: [...] "It's not often that you come across such an intelligent comedy that is extremely funny, thoroughly gripping and brilliantly packaged". The reviewer praised the performances: [...] "One of the best <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> one is the performance of every artiste, both in main roles and also those who are there even in a scene or so". Also praising the screenplay, cinematography, and music, the review concluded: [...] "Maheshinte Prathikaram is one of the finest comedies to have happened in Malayalam during recent years".|$|E

[...] "Gold Digger" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] are {{included on the}} album , with a studio recording of [...] "I Say a Little Prayer" [...] included as a bonus track on discs purchased from iTunes. [...] "Take a Bow" [...] was offered {{for use in the}} episode at a reduced licensing rate, something which surprised Murphy, who believed {{he would not be able}} to secure the rights to the song. He stated: [...] "Usually, people who have no. 1 hits, even if they give it to you, want hundreds of thousands of dollars, in my experience. But Rihanna gave it to us for a really good price. That's been one of the cool and surprising <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> experience, that these people that the cast and we really admire and respect have found out about the show and are supportive." ...|$|E
500|$|SFX {{reviewer}} Ian Berriman gave [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] {{three and}} a half out of five stars. He commented that the ethical debate made it [...] "a surprisingly mature story", but otherwise the Western tropes made it [...] "occasionally feel a little over-familiar". He also felt it was missing [...] "another twist or two", as most of the episode was dedicated to figuring {{out what to do with}} Jex rather than discovering more about him. Berriman also had two [...] "nitpicks" [...] that arose with the plot; the Gunslinger could just walk into the town and take Jex away, or the Doctor could take Jex away in the TARDIS. Dave Golder of the magazine labelled [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] as a [...] "disappointing" [...] science fiction Western episode, writing, [...] "There are some great <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> episode ... But in a show that usually has a lot of fun reinventing TV tropes, too much of [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] feels a bit been-there, done that." [...] Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times was more critical, writing that he did not [...] "believe" [...] or [...] "feel" [...] it. He felt that Westerns and Doctor Who were two things that [...] "never quite gelled" [...] and also criticised the [...] "languorous pace" [...] the fact that Rory had little to do. However, he did praise the [...] "gorgeous" [...] set and the [...] "cleverly constructed a morality play".|$|E

Another significant <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> place is {{that a large number of}} termite mounds(valmeekam) can be seen at different spots.

500|$|... "You Belong with Me"'s {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Roman White. In the video, Swift portrays both the protagonist and antagonist, which she respectively described as [...] "the nerd, who is pining away for this guy that she can't have" [...] and [...] "the popular girl." [...] Swift described the popular girl's persona as [...] "horrible and scary and intimidating and perfect". Her love interest is portrayed by American actor Lucas Till; Swift met Till while acting {{on the set of}} [...] in April 2008. She later asked him to act in the video, as she was intrigued by his [...] "cool look", embodying a [...] "dreamy guy". In regards to his acting on the video, Swift said, [...] "He's absolutely perfect for the part and really fun to be around, too." [...] According to her, the video's plot is [...] "charming"; she also said that, [...] "the whole video, I'm just sitting there pining away, wishing I could be in her position." [...] In regards to the video's conclusion, White explained that Swift [...] "becomes who she really is", while Swift thought it was a happy ending. Swift commented, [...] "One of my favorite <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> video is that there wasn't a standard performance scene. This video was pretty much all story line and I'm narrating it in the moment, basically narrating while all this is happening around me." ...|$|E
500|$|Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad {{said that}} he was not certain if [...] "this was a great 30 Rock episode" [...] but that it [...] "had all of the {{elements}} that make the good ones: funny one-liners and Liz and Jack both looking for something better in their lives." [...] He was complimentary towards Matt Damon's appearance, writing that he [...] "was one of the best <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> season finale episode", but admitted he could not see Damon [...] "being Liz's boyfriend or husband next season." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin wrote that he enjoyed Kenneth's rant against his former co-workers, and said that this episode [...] "was a terrific end to a season that wobbled for a while but ended strongly." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste magazine said that Kenneth's story was [...] "an enjoyable diversion". In regard to the finale, itself, Gandert noted that it was [...] "pretty good, but not outstanding, which is a fitting way to conclude a season that never quite hit its stride but was still consistently entertaining." [...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Emily Exton noted that Damon's character was a [...] "perfect match" [...] for Liz. Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, wrote that Damon was [...] "perfectly Damon-esque". Blake reported that she had been rooting for the Avery character since first appearing in the series, but acknowledged [...] "that there's something undeniably sweet about Jack and Nancy." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning complimented Julianne Moore's performance, writing that she was [...] "engaging". Canning said that Kenneth and Jenna's plots [...] "added more hilarity to the episode" [...] and that on their own [...] "these storylines [...] very entertaining. But combine them into one fantastic, fast and funny half hour and you're left with near perfection." [...] Alexandra Martell of New York magazine said that Avery's pregnancy was [...] "going to drive much of next season, but if that means more Elizabeth Banks, we're cool." [...] Martell wrote that Kenneth getting fired was a [...] "nice twist", but that [...] "the highlight" [...] of [...] "I Do Do" [...] was Jenna discovering Paul dressing up as Cher. TV Guides Adam Mersel opined that the [...] "biggest twist in the series' history" [...] was Nancy revealing that Avery was pregnant.|$|E
2500|$|G-B-D-F-A-C (the B is a harmonic). One of the {{interesting}} <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> chord (as described by Pedler) is how McCartney's high bass note reverberates inside the soundbox of Lennon's acoustic guitar and begins {{to be picked up}} on Lennon's microphone or pick-up during the sounding of the chord. This gives the chord its special [...] "wavy" [...] and unstable quality. Pedler describes the effect as a [...] "virtual pull-off".|$|E

5000|$|Circle {{time can}} be used to help solve {{problems}} which have been identified by either the teacher or students.

2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} good review: [...] "And if {{you thought}} we were done with surprises to set up next season, {{let me assure you}} we’re just getting started. Who shows up in Chinatown? None other than the Evil Queen, who claims “Regina never should have let me out to play.” And this is a war now. You thought the Big Bad for season 6 was Hyde? Try Dark Regina instead. And yes, I’m into it. Lana Parrilla {{is one of the best}} <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> show, and I’ll take {{anything}} that gives her a chance to flex her acting chops." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2009, Jason Salzenstein of Edge Boston commented favorably of the Corbin Fisher-produced photo book Playing Hard to Get {{distributed}} by Bruno Gmunder. [...] "In fact, {{one of the}} best <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> volume is its simplicity, and the natural beauty of the models. When 'boy next door' has come to mean Abercrombie & Fitch perfection, it’s refreshing to see a book filled with guys who actually look like they could live in your neighborhood," [...] wrote Salzenstein. Carsten Weidemann of the German language site Queer.de gave Playing Hard to Get a positive review, and noted that Corbin Fisher became successful quickly. Weidemann called Corbin Fisher, [...] "athletic, sexy".|$|E

One of the great <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> career {{is that you have}} the {{opportunity}} every time to go in and start again with a blank slate and think, 'What can we do differently? How can we make this better? Where can we go from here?' Every album has a story, and to constantly have a fresh opportunity to do it is really satisfying." ...|$|E

5000|$|Sodas and Popcorn comments: [...] "The best <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> {{movie is}} {{probably}} the screenplay. Thy Will Be Done, delivers an original story that captivates and sizzles. It’s a story anyone can relate to" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, well, we'll {{just have}} to plant them over again next spring," [...] said Anne philosophically. [...] "That is one good <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> world [...] . there are always sure to be more springs." ...|$|R

In a March 2010 interview, lead singer Raine Maida noted that after having gone back to re-learn songs from Spiritual Machines and Clumsy in preparation for their tour, he was [...] "brought back to the great <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> band". He added that fans — especially those who are particularly fond of the pre-Gravity albums — should expect to see [...] "a lot of stuff (from pre-Gravity albums) creeping its way back into our music".|$|E
2500|$|Chapman {{appeared}} in Captain Britain and MI: 13, as explained by writer Paul Cornell, [...] "One {{of the great}} <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> title is that, because all British superheroes are de facto part of MI-13, we can visit disparate parts of the Marvel UK scene without it being a big deal. Joe (not 'Joey', who's called Joey? Okay, kangaroos in Aussie, but apart from that...) {{is going to want}} to check in with [...] soon. Because they parted amicably, and that's still fine with him.

2500|$|Overall, Jakala said [...] "the {{series has}} grown on [...] over time. Part {{of the reason}} is that Hidaka isn't just writing about dry {{political}} systems in the abstract; he humanizes concepts by crafting various characters that we follow through the tumultuous events depicted in this book." [...] Both Jakala and McElhatton highlighted and praised the fact that although Sakuragi is depicted as [...] "handsome, suave, and poised" [...] (Jakala), [...] "decisive, smart, and charismatic" [...] (McElhatton), [...] "Yoshiki remembers to keep his character human; he's got his flaws, and his doubts that he hides from the public. In the end, it just makes him all the more likable" [...] (McElhatton). In Jakala's opinion, [...] "One of the strongest <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> series is Sakuragi's character" [...] because [...] "Hidaka hasn't gone too far in making Sakuragi unbelievably perfect". In opposition, Jason Thompson, writing for ANN, considered the depiction of [...] "a badass Japanese politician, who stands up to America, China and North Korea, more comedic than believable." ...|$|E
