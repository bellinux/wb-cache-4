5|$|In 1846, a {{dysentery}} epidemic swept communities {{along the}} Assiniboine River in Manitoba. On June 22 of that year, Belcourt left his mission at Baie-Saint-Paul {{to join a}} group of hunters on their journey south for the summer. <b>The</b> <b>hunters</b> carried the disease, infecting others, and 25 people died of dysentery by July 5. On the worst days, eight people had to be buried. Belcourt and six of <b>the</b> <b>hunters</b> travelled south to the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in search of medicine, as the priest's supply had quickly run out. With his medicine supplies replenished, the missionary {{headed back to the}} encampment of hunters before returning to his mission.|$|E
5|$|Swiss Hunters were {{operated}} as interceptors, with {{a secondary}} ground-attack role; from 1963 onwards, the outboard wing pylons were modified to carry two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. In the ground-attack role, the Swiss Air Force maintained {{an arsenal of}} conventional iron bombs, a number of compatible napalm bombs were also maintained for intended use by <b>the</b> <b>Hunters.</b> In the interceptor role, <b>the</b> <b>Hunters</b> were supplemented by a surface-to-air missile (SAM) defence system also procured from the United Kingdom, based on the Bristol Bloodhound. In case of unservicable airstrips, Swiss Air Force Jets would take off from adjacent highways, using them as improvised runways.|$|E
60|$|Could {{you have}} seen <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> with <b>the</b> terrible gun and Lightfoot the Deer that morning on which the hunting season opened you might have thought that Lightfoot was hunting <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> instead of <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> hunting Lightfoot. You see, Lightfoot was behind <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> instead of in front of him. He was {{following}} <b>the</b> <b>hunter,</b> so as {{to keep track of}} him. As long as he knew just where <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> was, he felt reasonably safe.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hunter</b> Valley Coal Chain (HVCC) is {{the chain}} of coal {{delivery}} in New South Wales, Australia from (mainly open-cut) coal mines in <b>the</b> <b>Hunter</b> Region to <b>the</b> Port of Newcastle and domestic coal-fired power stations in <b>the</b> <b>Hunter</b> Valley. <b>The</b> HVCC essentially follows the path of <b>the</b> <b>Hunter</b> River travelling south-east from the mining areas in <b>the</b> <b>Hunter</b> Valley to Newcastle.|$|R
50|$|A black hunter {{walks over}} to a rabbit hole where Bugs is eating his carrots. Bugs is led to a trunk where he tricks <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> into {{destroying}} <b>the</b> tree. Bugs distracts <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> after introducing himself, and digs underground and when <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> realizes that Bugs has his gun. Bugs has <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> run far enough so he can go down the rabbit hole. Realizing {{that he has been}} had, <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> uses a toilet plunger to catch Bugs. However, Bugs tickles <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> and flees into another rabbit hole. <b>The</b> <b>hunter</b> grabs <b>the</b> plunger, only to find a skunk under him. Next, Bugs lures <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> into a cave, where they encounter a black bear. All three of them run into the rabbit hole and when Bugs and <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> realize <b>the</b> bear is in the hole, they run off in fright.|$|R
5|$|During the Suez Crisis of 1956, Hunters of No. 1 and No. 34 Squadrons {{based at}} RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus flew escort for English Electric Canberra bombers on {{offensive}} missions into Egypt. For {{most of the}} conflict <b>the</b> <b>Hunters</b> engaged in local air defence due to their lack of range.|$|E
5|$|Evolve {{features}} {{five different}} modes: Hunt, Nest, Rescue, Defend and Arena, which have different objectives for both <b>the</b> <b>Hunters</b> and the Monster. Evolve provides two different structures to these game modes: Quick Play, which starts a single playthrough match; and Evacuation, {{which serves as}} a five-match, multiplayer story mode. In Evacuation, each match gives the winning side an advantage in the next map, such as having a toxic gas the Monster is immune to, or autonomous gun turrets to assist <b>the</b> <b>Hunters.</b> The Evacuation mode ends with a 'Defend' match. Evolve also features an Observer Mode, allowing players to watch a match without playing in the match. The spectator can jump between cameras and view the match from both the Hunters' and the Monster's perspectives.|$|E
5|$|Honeyguides {{are among}} the few birds that feed on wax. They are named for the greater honeyguide which leads {{traditional}} honey-hunters to bees' nests and, after <b>the</b> <b>hunters</b> have harvested the honey, feeds on the remaining contents of the hive.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, the {{discovery}} of wing cracking led to the quick retirement of all Hunter F.58As. The end of the Cold War also allowed Switzerland to retire its Hunters earlier than expected; the Hunter was completely withdrawn from Swiss service in 1994. The Swiss Air Force lost the capability to carry out air-to-ground operations when <b>the</b> <b>Hunters</b> were withdrawn from service.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of a match, a 30-second headstart is given to the Monster so that they can have enough time to escape before <b>the</b> <b>Hunters</b> parachute from a plane to where the Monster started. Each map features an open world environment for players to explore and play within. To help <b>the</b> <b>Hunters</b> navigate the environments quickly, they are equipped with jetpacks, allowing them to jump over obstacles and cliffs. The jetpack {{can also be used to}} dodge attacks performed by the monster, though it consumes a Hunter's energy. The team can track the monster, as well as place waypoints on an interactive map. The color of these waypoints are different based on what players have marked. The waypoint mark turns yellow for environment, orange for wildlife or red for the Monster.|$|E
5|$|The Monster saves a young shepherdess (Anne Darling) from drowning. Her screams {{upon seeing}} him alert two hunters, who shoot and injure the creature. <b>The</b> <b>hunters</b> raise a mob that sets out in pursuit. Captured and trussed to a pole, the Monster is hauled to a dungeon and chained. Left alone, he breaks his chains, kills {{the guards and}} escapes into the woods.|$|E

5000|$|Realizing that Bugs is on <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> while walking, <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> fires off a {{swarm of}} {{anthropomorphic}} birdshot bullets. In a madcap chase, the bullets chase Bugs {{into a series of}} holes, including a [...] "fake" [...] golf hole and the cave where the skunk is at. Bugs then lures <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> into a log {{sitting on the edge of}} a cliff, through which <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> runs numerous times (each time running to the other side as Bugs spins the log around so that <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> keeps running off the cliff) until he falls to the ground. Bugs is confronted by <b>the</b> angered <b>hunter</b> and, in a desperate plea for his life, baits <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> into playing what turns out to be a “strip” dice game. Bugs wins the game and walks off mocking <b>the</b> <b>hunter's</b> speech and wearing <b>the</b> <b>hunter's</b> clothes, leaving <b>the</b> man with a leaf covering his crotch to ad-lib “Well, call me Adam.” Bugs grabs the leaf during the [...] "iris out".|$|R
5|$|There are a {{total of}} five Monsters {{featured}} in Evolve. Similar to <b>the</b> <b>Hunters,</b> players need to inflict a certain amount of damage before unlocking a new Monster. The five different Monster-types also have different abilities, both offensive and defensive. Players control the Monster from a third-person perspective, and it features gameplay similar to an action game, unlike <b>the</b> <b>Hunters.</b> More abilities are given to a Monster after its evolution. Gameplay mechanics do not change much after the release of Stage 2, but monsters are made more powerful. They are given more health, stamina, armor, and skill points to unlock all abilities. Cooldown time abilities also shortened and recharge rate becomes significantly faster.|$|E
5|$|Wraith: The Wraith is {{the third}} unlockable monster. The Wraith can warp towards a Hunter and unleash a blast, dealing damage to <b>the</b> <b>Hunters.</b> They can also launch a small arena within a map which grants them bonus armor and strength. The Wraith also {{has the ability to}} {{teleport}} between places and kidnap a Hunter whilst in a group.|$|E
5|$|Actors {{returning}} to play recurring characters included: Elizabeth Gracen as Amanda, an international thief; Roland Gift as Xavier St. Cloud, a hedonistic killer; and Peter Hudson as James Horton, Dawson's brother-in-law {{and leader of}} <b>the</b> <b>Hunters,</b> a group of renegade Watchers who believe Immortals must be eliminated. New recurring characters introduced in the season were: Immortal baseball player Carl Robinson, portrayed by Bruce A. Young; CID Special Agent Renee Delaney, played by Stacey Travis; and Immortal mentor Rebecca Horne, played by Nadia Cameron.|$|E

5|$|By 1991, Singapore's {{fleet of}} combat {{aircraft}} included the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, the Northrop F-5 Tiger II, {{as well as}} the locally modernised and upgraded ST Aerospace A-4SU Super Skyhawk; <b>the</b> <b>Hunters</b> were active but obsolete in comparison. The type was finally retired and phased out of service in 1992, with the 21 surviving airframes being sold off to an Australian warbird broker, Pacific Hunter Aviation Pty, in 1995.|$|E
5|$|During the 1973 Chilean coup d'état, some of <b>the</b> <b>Hunters</b> {{were used}} by {{military}} officers {{as part of the}} effort to successfully overthrow the socialist president of Chile, Salvador Allende, on 11 September 1973. On 10 September 1973, coup leaders ordered <b>the</b> <b>Hunters</b> to relocate to Talcahuano in preparation. The following morning, the aircraft were used to conduct bombing missions against the presidential palace, Allende's house in Santiago, and several radio stations loyal to the government. The UK had signed contracts prior to the Chilean coup d'état for delivery of a further seven Hunters, as well as performing engine overhauls and the delivery of other equipment. The government under Prime Minister James Callaghan delayed the delivery of the aircraft, along with vessels and submarines also on order; the trade unions took action to block delivery of refurbished Hunter engines at the East Kilbride plant until October 1978. The action was led by Rolls Royce workers, Bob Fulton, Robert Sommerville and John Keenan, who hid the engines in the factory. The Government of Chile bestowed on 16 April 2015, its highest civilian medal the Order Bernardo O'Higgins Medal on the three workers for their action of solidarity. In 1982, after the Falklands War, a number of Hunters were air freighted to Chile as part of the arrangements for providing support for UK operations in the South Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Evolve is {{an action}} video {{game with a}} focus on both co-operative, and competitive, {{multiplayer}} gameplay. The game adapts a '4v1' asymmetrical structure where four players take control of <b>the</b> <b>Hunters,</b> while the fifth player controls the Monster. The Hunters' main objective is to track and hunt the Monster in a limited amount of time, while the Monster's goal is to evolve and make themselves more powerful.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hunter</b> Valley Wine Zone Australian Geographical Indication was {{registered}} on 1 May 1996 and {{is approximately}} <b>the</b> entire <b>Hunter</b> River catchment. It contains only one named wine region, <b>Hunter.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Hunter</b> Wine Region Australian Geographical Indication was declared on 18 March 1997. It {{is not as}} large as <b>the</b> <b>Hunter</b> Valley zone, but includes most of the significant vineyards. It does not extend east of the Pacific Highway. <b>The</b> <b>Hunter</b> region has three subregions.|$|R

5|$|In {{the tales}} {{and beliefs of}} the Siberian Yupik people, killer whales are said to appear as wolves in winter, and wolves as killer whales in summer. Killer whales are {{believed}} to assist their hunters in driving walrus. Reverence is expressed in several forms: the boat represents the animal, and a wooden carving hung from the hunter's belt. Small sacrifices such as tobacco are strewn into the sea for them. Killer whales were believed to have helped <b>the</b> <b>hunters</b> even when in wolf guise, by forcing reindeer to {{allow themselves to be}} killed.|$|E
5|$|Other hunting traditions then follow, again {{rooted in}} religion. The warriors of the Kuru tribe in Africa commit a sacred act {{in which they}} copulate with the ground in belief that it will make the Earth fertile and produce animals for the hunt, and a stag hunt in France, rooted in ancient pagan beliefs of the Gauls, is blessed by a mass before the hunt takes place, during which <b>the</b> <b>hunters</b> and dogs chase and {{ultimately}} kill a fleeing stag. In a fox hunt, the Wild Fox Association sabotages the hunting efforts by serving wine laced with a laxative to <b>the</b> <b>hunters</b> and distracting the dogs with an Afghan bitch in heat. Their efforts are then connected to species conservation, and to exemplify that hunters are truly concerned in wildlife conservation, Argentine hunters capture an Andean condor to sell to a zoo. A collage of other conservation efforts is shown, including the tagging of white rhinoceroses, grizzly bears and elephants, which are shot with morphine darts. Argentinian deer and elephant seals are physically subdued and marked. Tourists on Africans safaris then come to view the conservation efforts, which the narrator claims to have seemingly negated the animals' violent instincts. This deception is demonstrated with the mauling of a tourist named Pit Dernitz by lions.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{from the}} release of Stage 2, changes {{were made to the}} hunter classes. Every class now {{possesses}} the ability to deploy a force field, an ability once exclusive to the Trapper class. It can be used to limit the Monster's movement to a small area. The ability's cooldown time decreases when <b>the</b> <b>hunters</b> deal enough damage to the monster. Starting from Stage 2, the health of all hunters regenerate if they manage to avoid damage, and they no longer have to rely on the Medic class.|$|E

30|$|We {{consider}} a game played by two players: <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> and <b>the</b> rabbit. This game is described using a graph G(V,E) where V {{is a set}} of vertices and E {{is a set of}} edges. Both players may use a randomized strategy. <b>The</b> <b>hunter</b> can move from vertex to vertex along edges. The rabbit can move to any vertex at once. <b>The</b> <b>hunter’s</b> purpose is to catch the rabbit in as few steps as possible. On the other hand, the rabbit considers a strategy that maximizes the time until <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> catch <b>the</b> rabbit. If <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> moves to a vertex that the rabbit is at, the game finishes and we say that <b>the</b> <b>hunter</b> catches <b>the</b> rabbit.|$|R
