5|$|Mission {{managers}} {{called up}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> to alert {{them of the}} find, advising Altman ("Scooter") {{that one of the}} orbiter's wing leading edge sensors recorded a debris event during ascent, around 104 – 106 seconds following liftoff, which may have been the cause of the damage seen in that area.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB sent {{a team to}} {{the crash}} site to {{investigate}} the accident. They concluded that, unknown <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew,</b> ice had collected on the wings, which disrupted airflow and reduced lift.The inquiry lasted just under one year.|$|E
5|$|According to Nathan Fillion, {{there was}} an episode in which the crew land on a dying planet. The {{inhabitants}} try to steal Serenity, after they explain <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> about their need {{to get off the}} planet. The problem is that unless they were to run into another ship along the way, with the extra passengers, Serenity would not have enough fuel and oxygen {{to make it to the}} closest destination. While everyone else is asleep, Mal takes the ship himself and discovers that help never would have arrived.|$|E

5000|$|The frigate {{was built}} at Rotherhithe between 1756 and 1759 and was {{commissioned}} into the Royal Navy as HMS Minerva during the Seven Years' War. Under {{the command of}} Captain Alexander Hood, she {{took part in the}} Battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November 1759. In mid-1761 prize money was paid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> of ships taking part in the battle, and also <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> of [...] and Minerva, for the capture of the St. Simon.|$|R
5|$|Following new sea trials, Haruna was {{assigned}} on 10 December 1928 to the Fourth Battleship Division of the Second Fleet as the Emperor's special ship. For the next 12 months, she operated between Sasebo, Port Arthur, and the East China Sea. On 1 February 1929, Prince Takamatsu, {{the younger brother}} of Emperor Hirohito, {{was assigned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew.</b> On 20 November 1929, she was reassigned to the First Battleship Division. She was placed in reserve on 1 December 1930.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Hashimoto {{volunteered for}} the {{submarine}} service, and in 1937, he served aboard destroyers and submarine chasers off {{the shores of the}} Republic of China. On 15 November, as a sub-lieutenant, Hashimoto was assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> of the gunboat Hozu, and was promoted to lieutenant on 1 December. During that time, his brother was killed in action fighting on the Chinese mainland.|$|E
5|$|Mobile data {{terminal}} – Some ambulances are fitted with Mobile {{data terminal}}s (or MDTs), which are connected wirelessly {{to a central}} computer, usually at the control center. These terminals can function instead of or alongside the two-way radio {{and can be used}} to pass details of jobs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew,</b> and can log the time the crew was mobile to a patient, arrived, and left scene, or fulfill any other computer based function.|$|E
5000|$|However, the Ferret {{normally}} {{carried a}} defensive fit of a [...]303in Bren {{light machine gun}} or pintle-mounted [...]30in Browning light machine gun in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew's</b> personal weapons.|$|R
5000|$|The country {{holding the}} regatta {{is obliged to}} offer lodging and food <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first <b>crew</b> of each country, National Secretaries and SCIRA authorities, and if {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second <b>crew.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mission control crew shifts conduct 24-hour {{operations}} {{supporting the}} three major functions of satellite control; telemetry, tracking and commanding. Orbital analysts and program engineers provide program specific knowledge and support <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews.</b> <b>The</b> operators perform pre-contact planning, real time contact and post-contact evaluation. The squadron conducts more than 2,000 contacts a month.|$|R
5|$|NASA's {{original}} plan for safely de-orbiting Hubble was {{to retrieve it}} using a space shuttle. Hubble would then have most likely been displayed in the Smithsonian Institution. This {{is no longer possible}} since the space shuttle fleet has been retired, and would have been unlikely in any case due to the cost of the mission and risk <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew.</b> Instead, NASA considered adding an external propulsion module to allow controlled re-entry. Ultimately NASA installed the Soft Capture and Rendezvous System, to enable deorbit by either a crewed or robotic mission.|$|E
5|$|On April 25, an {{unmanned}} Progress resupply mission, Progress M1-2, {{launched from}} the Baikonur Cosmodrome {{to the station}} to deliver supplies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew.</b> Progress M1-2 docked with Mir on April 27. On April 26, the Progress M1-1 spacecraft, which had been docked since February and {{was used by the}} Russian Federal Space Agency to boost the station to a higher orbit, undocked and de-orbited over the Pacific Ocean east of New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Potemkin {{reached its}} {{destination}} at 23:00 on 7 July and the Romanians {{agreed to give}} asylum <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> if they would disarm themselves and surrender the battleship. Ismails crew decided the following morning to return to Sevastopol and turn themselves in, but Potemkins crew voted to accept the terms. Captain Negru, commander of the port, came aboard at noon and hoisted the Romanian flag and then allowed the ship to enter the inner harbor. Before the crew disembarked, Matushenko ordered that the Potemkins Kingston valves be opened so Potemkin would sink to the bottom.|$|E
50|$|The role of INS Virbahu is {{to provide}} {{administrative}} and logistic support <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 8th and 11th Submarine Squadrons. It also provides accommodation, messing, welfare and recreational facilities <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> of submarines as applicable.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> five {{remaining}} <b>crews</b> created dance routines {{inspired by}} Rihanna, {{beginning with a}} group performance to [...] "We Found Love" [...] featuring Calvin Harris. Unlike last season, where her choreographer distributed the challenges, Rihanna delivered them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> herself.|$|R
50|$|After {{arriving}} at Hampton Roads shortly thereafter, Wilderness was assigned immediately <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Division of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She operated between Hampton Roads and various {{points along the}} James River {{through the end of}} August. While she performed a variety of duties during that time, she operated primarily as a supply ship. She also served as a transport and dispatch vessel when the occasion demanded. On the average, she apparently made two trips upriver from Hampton Roads per week, delivering fresh vegetables and provisions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> of naval vessels operating up the James River and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> of <b>the</b> lighthouses situated along that waterway.|$|R
5|$|The {{documentary}} {{was shot}} on 16mm colour film by cameraman John McGlashan, {{who had also}} worked on the BBC's M.R. James series of adaptations A Ghost Story for Christmas, of which the early installments were entirely filmed in Norfolk (Betjeman was a fan of Jamesian ghost stories, and often read them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> while travelling to locations). McGlashan was also a part-time priest for a Liberal Catholic church, {{and was able to}} bring to the production additional knowledge of the Sacraments.|$|E
5|$|The entire action {{lasted about}} forty minutes. The French were much {{worse off than}} the Americans in terms of casualties, with 7 Frenchmen killed and 33wounded {{compared}} to 3 Americans killed and 7wounded. A prize crew from Enterprise was sent aboard Flambeau and sailed her to Saint Kitts where she was condemned. The proceeds {{from the sale of}} Flambeau were adjudicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> of Enterprise.|$|E
5|$|Through March and April {{the divers}} and ships' crews worked to recover {{all manner of}} treasure: silver coins, silver bullion, doubloons, jewelry, {{a small amount of}} gold, and other artifacts. Concerned about the {{possibility}} of mutiny, Phips guaranteed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew,</b> who had been hired for seaman's wages, that they would receive shares in the find, even if he had to pay them from his own percentage. He carefully avoided putting in at any ports before anchoring at Gravesend, where he dispatched a courier to London with the news.|$|E
5000|$|A brief {{bulletin}} by Air France {{indicated that}} [...] "the misleading stopping and starting of the stall warning alarm, contradicting the actual {{state of the}} aircraft, greatly contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew's</b> difficulty in analyzing the situation." ...|$|R
2500|$|James & David, Foreman, master, a brig, was sailing from Passages when {{captured}} on 18 May; Surprise put <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> of Fidelity on her too, {{and then gave}} her up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews,</b> after first dismasting her; the [...] Revenue Cruiser Beresford towed James and David into Baltimore, County Cork, that same day.|$|R
2500|$|In 1850 the Admiralty {{awarded the}} Naval general Service Medal with clasp [...] "Egypt" [...] <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> of any vessel that {{had served in}} the {{campaign}} between 8 March and 2 September 1801. Bonne Cityonne is listed among <b>the</b> vessels whose <b>crews</b> qualified.|$|R
5|$|At 2:42 PM on April 11, 1945, off {{the coast}} of Kikaijima Island, a Japanese fighter pilot in an A6M5c Zero {{launched}} a kamikaze attack on the USS Missouri. Bill Obitz, a Seaman at the time, recalled that the attacking plane approached at an extreme angle and estimated that it was 20 feet (6 m) above the water. Although struck by intense antiaircraft fire, the plane survived and struck the ship's starboard side at frame 169 below the main deck. While the impact of one of the plane's wings started a fire at 5-inch mount number 3, its 500-pound bomb did not detonate, so the damage was minimal. There were no American casualties, but the Japanese pilot died. Parts of the plane's wreckage and {{the top half of the}} pilot's body landed on board the Missouri. The plane's wing was turned over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> to be cut up for souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|Data {{is visiting}} D'Sora, but she seems unhappy {{and he is}} acting erratically {{in order to find}} an {{appropriate}} response to make her happy. It becomes evident <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> that the nebula is causing distortions in space; Picard orders the ship into warp to leave the nebula as quickly as possible but this speeds up the distortions. Whilst investigating them, Lieutenant Van Mayter (Georgina Shore) is killed when a distortion embeds her into the deck. Data discovers that dark matter is causing the distortions. The ship can detect the pockets at short range, but not in enough time {{to move out of the}} way. Worf proposes using a shuttle to lead the Enterprise out, and Picard insists on piloting it alone.|$|E
5|$|Firedrake, {{the sixth}} ship {{of her name}} in the Royal Navy, was built by Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company, Wallsend, {{although}} her hull was sub-contracted to Vickers Armstrongs. She was laid down at their Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne shipyard on 5 July, launched on 28 June 1934, {{the same day as}} her sister ship, , and completed on 30 April 1935. The ship cost 243,966 pounds, excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament. Firedrake was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet, but was sent to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet, together with most of her sisters, during the Abyssinian crisis, in September and remained there until December. Firedrake was refitted at Gibraltar from 14 December 1935 to 11 February 1936. She briefly returned home to give leave <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> later that month, but she returned to the Mediterranean in March and remained there until July when she began a refit at Sheerness Dockyard.|$|E
5000|$|The episode {{began with}} <b>the</b> three {{remaining}} <b>crews</b> performing a group number to [...] "All of the Lights" [...] featuring Rihanna. Season 5 winner Poreotix delivered <b>the</b> challenges <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews.</b> After <b>the</b> mid-show elimination, <b>the</b> final two <b>crews</b> performed their prepared routines {{to make their}} one last plea for votes.|$|R
50|$|Elliott {{was traded}} in January 2004 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Columbus <b>Crew</b> in {{exchange}} for a first round pick in the 2005 MLS SuperDraft. He played every game in the 2005 season but was unable <b>to</b> help <b>the</b> <b>Crew</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MLS Cup Playoffs as they finished bottom of the Eastern Conference.|$|R
50|$|His implant {{proved to}} be an {{occasional}} problem, preventing him from killing those who were a clear menace <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew's</b> safety ("Time Squad") and once breaking down and making him attack <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> and <b>the</b> Liberator itself ("Breakdown"). However, <b>the</b> respect <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> had for him was demonstrated when they went to immense risk to have his implant repaired rather than simply kill him.|$|R
5|$|In February 1827, Joaquim Inácio was {{transferred}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> of the corvette Duquesa de Goiás, {{in which he}} was {{to take part in the}} invasion of Carmen de Patagones, a village in the northeast of the United Provinces that served as a port for corsairs. The Duquesa de Goiás sank during the expedition, killing several crew members. Joaquim Inácio insisted on being the last officer to leave the vessel. He was next given the command of the schooner Constança. The invasion of Carmen was a complete failure, and the Brazilian land forces were defeated and taken prisoner. On 7 March, while Joaquim Inácio awaited news of the invasion, the Constança and another schooner were surrounded by enemy vessels. After a desperate battle, he was taken captive after refusing to surrender.|$|E
5|$|It {{was common}} for Christie to greet a {{returning}} submarine at the pier, and to award decorations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> on the spot. This bypassed naval award boards, and annoyed Kinkaid and Lockwood, possibly because confirmation of sinkings {{was accomplished by}} Ultra, the reading of coded Japanese radio traffic, and news of awards given so quickly could constitute a security breach. Complicating the matter was the fact MacArthur awarded army decorations to naval personnel; like Christie, he {{took it upon himself}} to authorize the decorations rather than to go through the standard review procedures. These events compelled Kinkaid to forbid Christie to give pierside awards, and to keep Christie from recommending the award of army medals to navy personnel. These events would ultimately contribute to Christie's dismissal as Commander of Submarines in Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|Newer {{aircraft}} designs {{such as the}} McDonnell Douglas MD-11 {{have incorporated}} hydraulic fuses to isolate a punctured section and prevent a total loss of hydraulic fluid. Following the UAL 232 accident, such fuses were installed in the number 3 hydraulic system in the area below the number 2 engine on all DC-10 aircraft to ensure sufficient control capability remained if all three hydraulic system lines should be damaged in the tail area. Although elevator and rudder control would be lost, the aircrew would {{still be able to}} control the aircraft's pitch (up and down) with stabilizer trim, and would be able to control roll (left and right) with some of the aircraft's ailerons and spoilers. Although not an ideal situation, the system provides a greater measure of control than was available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> of United 232.|$|E
25|$|Three U.S. diplomats {{were sent}} to Hainan <b>to</b> meet <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> and assess their conditions, and to {{negotiate}} their release. They were first allowed <b>to</b> meet with <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> {{three days after the}} collision. U.S. officials complained at the slow pace of the Chinese decision.|$|R
60|$|As {{the leading}} {{idea is to}} strike terror into the beholders, the {{greatest}} number of lashes is inflicted on board the culprit's own ship, in order <b>to</b> render him <b>the</b> more shocking spectacle <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> of <b>the</b> other vessels.|$|R
50|$|Finally {{the ship}} is {{repaired}} and <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> is ready <b>to</b> leave Eden. <b>The</b> astronomer doubler, although recovering fully from his radiation exposure, decides to stay behind, and as the starship takes off, much <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew's</b> sadness, <b>the</b> two doublers stand by the ship's exhaust, choosing to die rather than return to their oppressive society.|$|R
