40|$|Nutrient {{recognition}} {{is one of}} the main physiological roles of the gustatory system. In mammals, it is well established that <b>the</b> taste of <b>sodium</b> salts is primarily mediated by <b>sodium</b> influx through <b>the</b> epithelial <b>sodium</b> channel. <b>The</b> epithelial <b>sodium</b> channel is a sodium-specific ion channel that is expressed across a wide range of transporting epithelia such as colon, kidney, and taste. In addition to its role as a salt taste receptor, <b>sodium</b> influx through <b>the</b> epithelial <b>sodium</b> channel is important systemically for maintaining sodium balance and blood pressure. Following our earlier work on the endocrine regulation of salt taste at the level of <b>the</b> epithelial <b>sodium</b> channel, we hypothesize that <b>the</b> epithelial <b>sodium</b> channel expressed in mouse taste receptor cells plays a central role in the restoration of salt and water balance. Using a multidisciplinary approach that includes patch clamp recording, functional sodium imaging, molecular biology, Western blotting, and behavioral assays, we have begun to investigate different mechanisms of <b>the</b> epithelial <b>sodium</b> channel regulation in the taste system. In the present study, we have demonstrated a number of mechanisms that regulate <b>the</b> epithelial <b>sodium</b> channel by both ions and/or hormones in mouse taste cells. In general, three new mechanisms of <b>the</b> epithelial <b>sodium</b> channel regulation were identified: (1) regulation of <b>the</b> epithelial <b>sodium</b> channel by chloride ions, (2) regulation of <b>the</b> epithelial <b>sodium</b> channel by insulin, and (3) alterations of <b>the</b> epithelial <b>sodium</b> channel function in diabetic taste cells. To test the relevance of one or more of these regulatory mechanisms in the animals 2 ̆ 7 behavior, we used a variety of short-term behavioral assays. Interestingly, the results suggested that insulin regulates salt intake in rodents, which dovetails nicely with our functional and molecular findings.

5|$|Like Castile soap, {{the chief}} {{ingredients}} of Nabulsi soap are virgin olive oil, water, and an alkaline sodium compound.
