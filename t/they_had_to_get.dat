5|$|The program {{expanded}} the usual {{conventions of the}} genre by using several types of metafiction, referencing the actors themselves or {{the nature of the}} program. An example within the plot is Sos mi muqui, a program within the program whose characters were based on the show's main characters. The actors' former characters are occasionally referenced in plots that place them in similar contexts than those of older fictions. Martín infiltrated a convent using a habit similar to the one Arana's character in Padre Coraje wore, and Esperanza wore clothes similar to those Oreiro's character in Muñeca Brava wore when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into a slum.|$|E

500|$|EastEnders: E20 was {{conceived}} by executive producer Diederick Santer {{as part of}} EastEnders 25th anniversary celebrations. Described as the [...] "naughty little brother or sister to the main show", it was devised {{in a bid to}} target younger viewers and to develop and nurture new talent. Executive producer John Yorke, who oversaw the show, and is also controller of BBC drama production and new talent, said [...] "Fundamentally the whole idea of the show is it's a training ground for new talent, be that acting, writing, composing, remixing, everything. The fact is because it's online, we can take risks." [...] Nevertheless, the makers said they knew <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it right because [...] "the eyes of the World Wide Web would be watching." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. It was difficult to animate because the animators had to draw completely new designs for the locations outside of Springfield, such as Knoxville. The car scenes were also difficult to animate. At the time, The Simpsons was using traditional animation without computers, but <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> one for a scene where the camera spins around the car from above. The car was difficult to animate because it had to [...] "look real" [...] and not [...] "boxy like a truck". The car {{was based on a}} 1993 Oldsmobile car with rounded edges. The Simpsons animator David Silverman said that the episode was [...] "probably the most difficult one" [...] Scott had to direct on the show.|$|E

This {{became the first}} Telugu film to be shot there and also made the factory a notable {{location}} for the song shoots of Kannada films such as Rana Vikrama (2015), Ranna (2015), and Mr. Airavata (2015). Both the song and fight sequences were filmed in 23 days. Mahesh {{and the members of}} the film's unit had fallen sick and continued work using antibiotics. Mahesh called it the [...] "most strenuous schedule I went through in my life", and added, [...] "For every shot, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the dust up to get the right visual.

[...] In the string of interviews with Gore that followed, Gore himself felt like they [...] "were making Kill Al Vol. 3". Bender had other issues including a time frame that was [...] "grueling" [...] {{and needed to be}} done in [...] "{{a very short period of}} time" [...] despite many filming locations planned. These included many locations throughout the United States and also included China. [...] "It was a lot of travel in a very short period of time.

500|$|... : As new housemates, Bea, David, Hira, Kenneth and Tom {{could not}} {{nominate}} {{and could not}} be nominated by their fellow housemates. However, they were set a secret mission, in which <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Halfwit and Noirin (who were randomly chosen by Hira) nominated for eviction by the other housemates. Failure meant automatically facing the public vote. Charlie and Lisa received the most nominations, therefore the new housemates failed their mission and faced eviction themselves. As punishment for discussing nominations, Charlie, Dogface (who also failed to nominate the required two people for eviction this week), Halfwit, Marcus, Noirin and Siavash also faced the public vote and Big Brother voided all nominations. Therefore, Lisa and Rodrigo were the only two housemates not to face eviction this week. The eviction was later cancelled due to Kenneth walking from the house. During the time the lines were available to vote, Kenneth had received the most votes.|$|E
500|$|In October 2009, actress Barbara Windsor's {{decision}} to leave EastEnders after sixteen years of portraying the character Peggy Mitchell was announced. The show's executive producer, Bryan Kirkwood, {{said it was a}} massive honour for him to be responsible for the character's exit, but explained that as she has become the [...] "quintessential matriarch of the show", <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the exit storyline right, which he said would be [...] "both epic and poignant". Windsor gave one year's notice of leaving, giving the production team time {{to come up with a}} storyline, and was asked to keep her decision a secret until the announcement was made. Kirkwood looked at Windsor's first episode and decided her exit should be about Peggy and her son Phil, as Peggy's arrival came at a time when Phil needed her most, and since then, she had believed that Phil still needed her. Peggy's exit came when she realised his mother was not what Phil needed. Windsor did not want to know in advance how her character would leave, but hoped she would not be killed off. She commented: [...] "My exit was beautifully written and I really couldn’t have asked for a better send-off for Peggy." ...|$|E

500|$|Another story arc saw Charlie {{reveal that}} her sister Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds) {{is in fact}} her daughter. Charlie gave birth to Ruby after she was raped by Grant Bledcoe (Clayton Watson), when she was younger. Both Anderson and Breeds found the storyline {{challenging}} and felt <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it right. Breeds said it made her nervous but {{was pleased with the}} end result. She said she had to let it affect her own emotions to effect the viewing public. [...] "The revelation ruins their relationship, and Anderson said that Charlie was [...] "trying desperately to bridge this gap". Breeds added [...] "Ruby just wants to get some security back, everything she thought her life was is totally up in the air". Ruby becomes confused and starts to ask herself questions such as [...] "Where do I stand now?" [...] and [...] "How do I reconcile this?" [...] Breeds said it was a [...] "big exploration" [...] and a journey for Ruby, with Anderson agreeing. Anderson felt there was a beautiful element to the storyline and opined: [...] "Although it is tragic, you feel sorry for Charlie and you can sort of understand where it has all come from." [...] She added that everyone feels sorry for Ruby, meaning neither are wrong. Furthermore, she said, [...] "You are just rooting for them, you just want them to get back to how they were and it {{is a bit of a}} journey." [...] Comparing the storyline to the lesbian plot she said, [...] "Perhaps this storyline was a little bit harder, you've seen the start of this storyline and there is a lot more to come and it wasn't easy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Views on Patlabor the Movie 2 {{have been}} very positive. One review from the Anime Cafe states that Patlabor the Movie 2 is an [...] "intellectually {{stimulating}} anime", combining the movie's mecha concept with the plot similar to a Tom Clancy novel. Anime World Order states that while the sequel {{is better than the}} first in terms of action and drama, some viewers may not understand the political aspects of the film, though its philosophical themes may be easier to understand, especially with the concept of just war and unjust peace. Japan Hero's review of the movie commented well on the side story that the movie showcased the main characters who had to let go of their past and to move on and grow up, with the fact that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back together and face a threat that could make a country ruled by civilian authority or one ruled by fear and paranoia. Anime News Network has noted the background music used in the movie [...] "favors heavy, pulsing techno beats backed by airy, haunting vocals for the intense scenes and soaring synthesized scores in other places ... If you’re looking for something wholly dramatic, insightful, and mature then you’ve come to the right place." ...|$|E
2500|$|Captain Karl Friesenhahn was the {{technical}} or bridge commander and {{in charge of}} the demolition charges.

Scheller and Bratge entered the railroad tunnel where the electric switch controlling the detonators was located. Friesenhahn followed them, but before he could get to the tunnel, the concussion from an exploding shell knocked him unconscious. He regained his senses 15 minutes later and continued towards the tunnel. Bratge yelled at Friesenhahn to blow up the bridge. Friesenhahn replied <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the order in writing from Scheller, who was {{at the other end of}} the [...] tunnel that curved at almost 90° under Erpeler Ley. Bratge ran to find Scheller, got the order in writing, and when he returned to tell Friesenhahn to detonate the charges, Friesenhahn in turn required Bratge to give him the order in writing.|$|E
