60|$|In my room (for cabin I cannot call it) stood my palkee, fitted as a bed, with {{mosquito}} curtains; a {{chair and}} table. On one side were placed all my papers and plants, under arrangement to go home; on the other, my provisions, rice, sugar, curry-powder, a preserved ham, and cheese, etc. Around hung <b>telescope,</b> botanical <b>box,</b> dark lantern, barometer, and thermometer, etc., etc. Our position was often ashore, and, Hindoo-like, on the lee-shore, going bump, bump, bump, so that I could hardly write. I considered myself fortunate in having to take this slow conveyance down, it enabling me to write and arrange all day long.|$|R
40|$|We report Charge Couple Devices (CCD) {{observations}} of the central region of the Compton <b>Telescope</b> (COMPTEL) error <b>box</b> for the 31 Jan 1993 gamma-ray burst. One optical transient was found. Its distance from the IPN track and Energy Gamma Ray Experiment <b>Telescope</b> (EGRET) error <b>box</b> make the association of this object with GRB 930131 doubtful. We present new CCD {{observations of}} two objects identified by Schaefer et al. (1993) that are located within a few arcminutes of the interplanetary network (IPN) that were reported to be possibly variable. We also report observations on the ROSAT All-sky Survey Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) source noted by those investigators and the RS CVn star HD 106255. The ROSAT All-Sky Survey EUV source is suggested to arise from a faint, but relatively rich cluster of galaxies. HD 106255 is located approximately 7 min from the IPN. Our CCD results show that this star was bluer than previously reported, but these observations were obtained significantly after the occurrence of GRB 930131. It {{is not possible to}} estimate the color of HD 106255 when the burst occurred...|$|R
5000|$|HSC (Half Slotted Container): Half-Slotted Containers (HSC) {{are similar}} to an RSC, but with only one set of flaps. They are useful when an open-top {{container}} is desired. HSCs {{can be used to}} create a <b>telescope</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a unique suite of mechanisms that make up the Deployment and Pointing System (DAPS) for the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER/SEXTANT) instrument, an X-Ray telescope, which will be mounted on the International Space Station (ISS). The DAPS system uses four stepper motor actuators to deploy the <b>telescope</b> <b>box,</b> latch it in the deployed position, and allow it to track sky targets. The DAPS gimbal architecture provides full-hemisphere coverage, and is fully re-stowable. The compact design of the mechanism allowed the majority of total instrument volume to be used for science. Override features allow DAPS to be stowed by ISS robotics...|$|E
40|$|Telescoping Half Slotted Containers (HSC) and Diagonal Corner Bliss style {{containers}} {{are popular}} choices for packaging agricultural {{products such as}} apples, pears, citrus, potatoes, garlic and most vegetables. This study evaluated two unique corrugated container designs, Kisch Full Circle Tray (FCT) and Single V Kisch Bliss, which are both viable designs available to replace the presently used styles of boxes for produce distribution. This paper presents the compression strength results of Telescoping HSC containers as compared to two possible replacements and the Diagonal Corner Bliss designs when stored under standard, refrigerated and tropical conditions. It also compares the material savings and the life-cycle environmental impacts for the three designs against the Telescoping HSC design. Comparing the average overall peak forces, across all three environmental conditions of the <b>Telescoping</b> HSC <b>boxes</b> {{to that of the}} three designs, it was concluded that the Kisch FCT boxes were approximately 17 % weaker, while providing material savings of over 14 %; the Diagonal Corner Bliss boxes were approximately 9 % weaker, while providing material savings of almost 22 % and the Single V Kisch Bliss boxes were approximately 14 % stronger, while providing material savings of over 19 %. Savings in material ranging from 14 to 22 % for the three designs tested, translates into significant energy savings, relative optimization of natural resources, reductions in green house gas emissions and relative minimization of waste water and solid waste generated during production in comparison to the <b>Telescoping</b> HSC style <b>boxes...</b>|$|R
50|$|The ISIM Electronics Compartment (IEC) is {{a section}} of ISIM that houses {{computing}} and electrical resources for the instruments. The main electronics {{for each of the}} instruments is housed in this thermally wrapped box. In 2014 the electronics for NIRspec were installed in the IEC. The IEC is mounted to the cryogenic structure of the main telescope, and the enclosure must maintain a much warmer temperature for the electronics inside, but not allow that heat to negatively affect the main <b>telescope.</b> The <b>box</b> can dissipate about 200 watts of electrical power. One of the considerations is to direct the majority of the heat (radiatively) in a roughly 20 degree angle in between the back of the main mirror structure and instruments and the sunshield. Not too close {{to the back of the}} telescope or too close to the sunshield, but by using baffles and insulation, direct the heat out into space. The IEC box sits just below most of the instruments and behind it, but above the spacecraft bus.|$|R
50|$|German {{instruments}} were actually fairly {{similar to the}} Norden, even before World War II. In the Lotfe 7, a similar set of gyroscopes provided a stabilized platform for the bombardier to sight through, although the more complex interaction between the bombsight and autopilot of the Norden was not used. The Lotfe 7 was dramatically simpler, consisting of a single metal box containing {{the vast majority of}} the mechanism, with a tube (Rohr) extending out the bottom with a mirror that reflected the image of the target into a small <b>telescope</b> in the <b>box.</b> The mechanisms within combined the functions of the Norden's stabilizer and optics, moving the mirror to stabilize the image as well as tracking the target. The controls were likewise much simpler than the Nordens', consisting primarily of three large knurled knobs to adjust aim.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{provide an}} {{overview}} of the robotic Super-LOTIS (Livermore Optical Transient Imaging System) telescope and present results from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow observations using Super-LOTIS and other Steward Observatory telescopes. The 0. 6 -m Super-LOTIS telescope is a fully robotic system dedicated to the measurement of prompt and early time optical emission from GRBs. The system began routine operations from its Steward Observatory site atop Kitt Peak in April 2000 and currently operates every clear night. The telescope is instrumented with an optical CCD camera and a four position filter wheel. It is capable of observing Swift Burst Alert <b>Telescope</b> (BAT) error <b>boxes</b> as early or earlier than the Swift UV/Optical Telescope (UVOT). Super-LOTIS complements the UVOT observations by providing early R- and I-band imaging. We also use the suite of Steward Observatory telescopes including the 1. 6 -m Kuiper, the 2. 3 -m Bok, the 6. 5 -m MMT, and the 8. 4 -m Large Binocular Telescope to perform follow-up optical and near infrared observations of GRB afterglows. These follow-up observations have traditionally required human intervention but we are currently working to automate the 1. 6 -m Kuiper telescope to minimize its response time...|$|R

40|$|The gamma-ray {{transient}} GRO J 1838 - 04 {{is one of}} {{the most}} enigmatic sources in the sky. Despite its closeness to the Galactic plane, it showed a strong gamma-ray flare in 1995 typical of blazars. However, no blazar is detected in its approx. 1 deg. error box, and a Galactic source is suspected. Other time variable gamma-ray sources are known in the Galactic disk, and GRO J 1838 - 04 may belong to a new class of sources (isolated young pulsars, the only proven Galactic gamma-ray sources, do not show variability). The Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA) observed the centroid of the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment <b>Telescope</b> (EGRET) error <b>box</b> of GRO J 1838 - 04 in April 1997. Five weak X-ray sources are detected, one of which appears to be diffuse (3 arcmins). No known radio source is coincident with the X-ray sources. A preliminary report of our results appeared and a more systematic report is being written. The fact that no prominent X-ray source appears in the field, excludes an X-ray transient source with strong persistent emission is a possible counterpart of GRO JI 838 - 04 (such as superluminal transients). To uncover the nature of GRO J 1838 - 04 requires more study of the weak X-ray sources in its error box, and a long-time scale monitoring of their variability...|$|R
