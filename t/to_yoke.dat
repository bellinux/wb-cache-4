5|$|According to Dasgupta, {{the term}} yoga {{can be derived}} from either of two roots, yujir yoga (<b>to</b> <b>yoke)</b> or yuj samādhau (to concentrate). Someone who {{practices}} yoga or follows the yoga philosophy {{with a high level of}} commitment is called a yogi (may be applied to a man or a woman) or yogini (traditionally denoting a woman).|$|E
5|$|According to Pāṇini, a 6th-century BCE Sanskrit grammarian, {{the term}} yoga {{can be derived}} from either of two roots, yujir yoga (<b>to</b> <b>yoke)</b> or yuj samādhau (to concentrate). In the context of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, the root yuj samādhau (to concentrate) is {{considered}} by traditional commentators as the correct etymology. In accordance with Pāṇini, Vyasa who wrote the first commentary on the Yoga Sutras, states that yoga means samādhi (concentration).|$|E
5|$|Adaptors are {{available}} to allow connection of DIN regulators <b>to</b> <b>yoke</b> cylinder valves (A-clamp or yoke adaptor), and to connect yoke regulators to DIN cylinder valves. (plug adaptors and block adaptors) Plug adaptors are rated for 232/240 bar, and can only be used with valves which are designed to accept them. Block adaptors are generally rated for 200 bar, {{and can be used}} with almost any 200 bar DIN valve.|$|E
40|$|Rats {{were exposed}} to an {{interlocking}} fixed-ratio 150 fixed-interval 5 -minute schedule of food reinforcement and then <b>to</b> <b>yoked</b> variable-ratio schedules in which individual ratios corresponded exactly to the ratios of responses to reinforcement obtained on the interlocking schedule. After additional training with the interlocking schedule, the rats were exposed <b>to</b> <b>yoked</b> variable-interval schedules in which intervals corresponded to the intervals between successive reinforcements obtained on the second interlocking schedule. Response rates were highest in the yoked VR condition and lowest in the yoked VI, while intermediate rates characterized the interlocking schedule. Break-run patterns of responding were generated by the interlocking schedule for all subjects, while both the yoked VR and VI schedules produced comparatively stable local rates of responding. These results indicate that responding is sensitive to the interlocking schedule's inverse relationship between reinforcement frequency and responses per reinforcement...|$|R

5|$|The Jugal Region, or Neala, is {{a region}} of the wing that is usually a small {{membranous}} area proximal {{to the base of}} the vannus strengthened by a few small, irregular veinlike thickenings; but when well developed it is a distinct section of the wing and may contain one or two jugal veins. When the jugal area of the forewing is developed as a free lobe, it projects beneath the humeral angle of the hindwing and thus serves <b>to</b> <b>yoke</b> the two wings together. In the Jugatae group of Lepidoptera it bears a long finger-like lobe. The jugal region was termed the neala ("new wing") because it is evidently a secondary and recently developed part of the wing.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine if an individual’s {{performance}} could be improved by integrating physiological arousal data with a computer task, specifically a video game, which increased or decreased in difficulty based on the person’s physiological status. Ninety-nine participants (80 males; 19 females) were included in the data analyses. The mean age of the included participants was 21. 9 years (SD = 2. 6). Using cardiac inter-beat interval (IBI) data each individual’s respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was derived and used to objectively assess the parasympathetic activity of the autonomic nervous system. The RSA data were continuously converted into a standardized arousal score. In the condition of interest, Auto, the difficulty of the computer game was continuously manipulated based on the real-time arousal score of the participant. Subjective arousal data were also collected verbally throughout each experimental session. It was hypothesized that manipulating the difficulty of the computer game such that arousal was maintained at an optimal level would result in better performance compared <b>to</b> <b>yoked</b> and manual control of game difficulty. Results showed that automated task difficulty manipulation actually resulted in lower performance scores compared <b>to</b> <b>yoked</b> assistance manipulation, and tended to result in lower scores compared to manual assistance manipulation...|$|R

[...] At Lahore the Muslim League formally recommitted itself to creating an independent Muslim state, including Sindh, Punjab, Baluchistan, the North West Frontier Province and Bengal, that would be [...] "wholly autonomous and sovereign". The resolution guaranteed protection for non-Muslim religions. The Lahore Resolution, moved by the sitting Chief Minister of Bengal A. K. Fazlul Huq, was adopted on 23 March 1940, and its principles formed the foundation for Pakistan's first constitution. Talks between Jinnah and Gandhi in 1944 in Bombay failed to achieve agreement. This was the last attempt to reach a single-state solution.|$|E
