5|$|A {{major part}} of modern weather {{forecasting}} is <b>the</b> <b>severe</b> weather alerts and advisories that the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is expected. This is done to protect life and property. Some {{of the most commonly}} known of severe weather advisories are <b>the</b> <b>severe</b> thunderstorm and tornado warning, as well as <b>the</b> <b>severe</b> thunderstorm and tornado watch. Other forms of these advisories include winter weather, high wind, flood, tropical cyclone, and fog. Severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media, including radio, using emergency systems as the Emergency Alert System, which break into regular programming.|$|E

30|$|We {{analyze the}} fixing time of <b>the</b> <b>severest</b> {{concurrency}} bugs and <b>the</b> <b>severest</b> non-concurrency bugs to investigate how fast <b>the</b> <b>severest</b> bugs get fixed. Based on the severity classification given in Section 3.3, “Blocker” group defined for categorizing the bugs with highest priority, thus we extract the bugs tagged as “Blocker” from our concurrency and non-concurrency bugs’ data sets. We also calculate the fixing time for each bug as explained in Section 3.2. We analyze the fixing {{time of the}} bug with “Blocker” severity in order to compare the fixing time for <b>the</b> <b>severest</b> concurrency and non-concurrency bugs.|$|R

5|$|After nearly 50,000cars were flooded and ruined, {{many people}} {{attempted}} {{to sell the}} cars across the country without telling of the car's history. Following the extreme flooding, a mosquito outbreak occurred, though FEMA provided aid to control the problem. Health officials also recommended disinfecting private wells with bleach, due to possible contamination from <b>the</b> <b>severe</b> flooding.

He was angered that Hoover refused to call a special legislative session to adopt relief measures after the regular congressional adjourned in early March 1931. He planned a series of speeches condemning Hoover beginning in June but was injured in an automobile accident on June 22, limiting his political activities {{for the remainder of the}} year.|$|E

5|$|Both sides {{introduced}} new tactics, {{units and}} equipment based on Western models, but the Polish-Lithuanian forces proved more adept with these innovations than the Russians. However, the main factors {{that kept the}} Russians from winning were the delay in moving siege artillery to Smolensk and <b>the</b> <b>severe</b> disruption of Russian supply lines by Polish cavalry. A scapegoat was nevertheless needed: Mikhail Shein was accused of treason and, together with his second-in-command Artemy Izmaylov and the latter's son Vasily, executed in Moscow on April 28, 1634. Learning from this defeat, the Russians would adopt new and more successful tactics in the Polish-Russian War (1654-1656).|$|E

5|$|By 1950, {{more than}} half of all {{employment}} was in the manufacturing sector. Due to economic difficulties, Studebaker closed its automotive manufacturing plants in South Bend in December 1963. A general decline in manufacturing soon followed as industry was being restructured nationwide. By the year 2000, manufacturing was only 16 percent of the local economy. Due to <b>the</b> <b>severe</b> loss of jobs, the city's population decreased by nearly 30,000 people during that period.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{presented}} his first budget in April 1932. He maintained <b>the</b> <b>severe</b> budget cuts {{that had been}} agreed at {{the inception of the}} National Government. Interest on the war debt was a major cost. Chamberlain reduced the annual interest rate on most of Britain's war debt from 5% to 3.5%. Between 1932 and 1938, Chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted to interest on the war debt.|$|E

Approximately 80% of the city's smog originates {{from other parts of}} the Pearl River Delta.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Participants {{with chronic}} fatigue {{syndrome}} were categorized into subtypes based on actigraphy and illness self-report symptom severity data. Each method identified two groups of patients, one with severe and one with less <b>severe</b> manifestations of <b>the</b> illness. For both subtypes, those in <b>the</b> more <b>severe</b> category had more physical functioning problems than those in <b>the</b> less <b>severe</b> categories. However, for the illness self-report symptom group, those in <b>the</b> more <b>severe</b> category had significantly more impairment in sleep, anxiety, depression, and pain, and more concurrent psychiatric status and Fibromyalgia than those in <b>the</b> less <b>severe</b> category. In contrast, those in <b>the</b> more <b>severe</b> actigraphy subtype group in comparison to <b>the</b> less <b>severe</b> group had more impairment in {{quality of life and}} cortisol readings. These findings suggest that CFS subtypes based on symptom severity and amount of activity identify different groups of patients with varying types of impairments...|$|R

5|$|Having {{achieved}} {{stability in}} the West, Alexios could turn his attention to <b>the</b> <b>severe</b> economic difficulties and {{the disintegration of the}} Empire's traditional defences. However, he still did not have enough manpower to recover the lost territories in Asia Minor and to advance against the Seljuks. At the Council of Piacenza in 1095, envoys from Alexios spoke to Pope Urban II about the suffering of the Christians of the East, and underscored that without help from the West they would continue to suffer under Muslim rule.|$|E
5|$|Having been raided twice by the Mongols {{within a}} single year, Transylvania felt the {{consequences}} of the invasion of 12411242 for more than two decades. The administrative centers of the province, such as Alba Iulia and Cetatea de Baltă, had been destroyed. Due to <b>the</b> <b>severe</b> depopulation, a process of organized colonization commenced that lasted for several decades. For example, a new wave of colonization resulted in the establishment of the Saxon seats of Sighişoara and Mediaş; and the lord of Ilia received, in 1292, royal permission to settle Romanians in the lands he owned.|$|E
