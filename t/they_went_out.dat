5|$|George Eyre {{was born}} the fourth and {{youngest}} son of politician Anthony Eyre, who had represented the constituency of Boroughbridge {{in a number of}} parliaments, and his wife, Judith Letitia. George's elder brother, Anthony Hardolph Eyre, also entered politics and represented Nottinghamshire during the 1800s. George attended Harrow School and after spending several months at an academy in Chelsea, entered the navy in 1782. His first ship was the 44-gun , under the command of Captain James King. <b>They</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to Jamaica escorting a convoy, and remained in the area {{for the rest of the}} American War of Independence.|$|E
5|$|In the 2012–13 season, Arsenal fell at {{the last}} 16 stage {{for the third time}} in three years, losing 3–1 to Bayern Munich at home, but {{managing}} to win 2–0 in the return leg, meaning <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> on the away goals rule. They were once again eliminated by Bayern Munich in the 2013–14 season after losing 2–0 at home, and drawing 1–1 away at Munich. They were eliminated by Monaco in Round of 16 in the 2014–15 season on away goals, and by Barcelona 5–1 on aggregate in 2015–16. Arsenal exited {{at the last}} 16 for the seventh consecutive time to Bayern Munich, losing 10–2 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{competed in}} the UEFA Cup in the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons and {{departed}} {{in the first and}} second round to FC Winterslag and Spartak Moscow respectively. The Heysel Stadium disaster of May 1985, during the 1985 European Cup Final between Liverpool and Juventus resulted in UEFA, and later FIFA, imposing a 'worldwide' ban on English teams from participating in European club competitions, initially for an indefinite period. Under George Graham, Arsenal returned to the European Cup in the 1991–92 season, having won the league championship a season earlier. <b>They</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> in the second round to Portuguese team Benfica in November 1991. The ban arising from the Heysel disaster had prevented Arsenal from competing in the European Cup when they won the league title two years previously, as well as preventing them from competing in the UEFA Cup on two occasions.|$|E

5|$|Fortune-West {{was born}} in Stratford, London and grew up as a {{supporter}} of Leyton Orient. He started his football career in non-League football with Tiptree United in the Eastern Counties League aged 17, with whom he played one season, filling the roles of full back, centre back and striker. He moved onto Bishop's Stortford and joined Dartford in the season <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> of business. A period at Dagenham & Redbridge followed this before he signed for Stevenage Borough in the Football Conference in 1994. He scored 7 goals in 17 league appearances for Stevenage in 1994–95, after which he moved into the Football League with Gillingham on 12 July 1995. The fee of £5,000 was raised for the cash-strapped club by its Supporters' Club. Becoming a full-time professional necessitated giving up a degree course at the University of Greenwich.|$|E
5|$|Struthers {{was one of}} six children, {{three boys}} and three girls. The boys were privately tutored in the classics, {{mathematics}} and modern languages at home in Brucefield House. <b>They</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> boating in summer, skating in winter on the nearby dam; they rode ponies, went swimming in the nearby Firth of Forth, and went for long walks with wealthy friends. Both his older brother James {{and his younger brother}} Alexander studied medicine. James Struthers became a doctor at Leith; Alexander Struthers died of cholera while serving as a doctor in the Crimean War. His sisters Janet and Christina provided a simple education at Brucefield for some poor friends, Daniel and James Thomson. Daniel (1833–1908) became a Dunfermline weaver as well as a historian and reformer.|$|E
5|$|Vaduz's {{success in}} their nation's cup ensured they {{gained access to}} the UEFA Cup, and in August 2002, Burgmeier scored his first European goal during a 1–1 with Livingston, the Scottish side's first game in Europe. In the second leg, Vaduz had a late goal {{disallowed}} during a 0–0, and so <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> in the qualifying round for the third successive year, losing on the away goals rule. Vaduz topped the Fall Season table that season, but failed to win promotion to the Swiss Super League after finishing fourth in the Final League. Their failure was offset with another victory in the Liechtenstein Cup, this time defeating Balzers in the final.|$|E

5|$|Confusion reigned {{over just}} what {{experiments}} had been conducted. Pusztai had mentioned {{two lines of}} genetically modified potatoes, meaning the two GNA lines, and this was reported by the media. The Rowett institute mistakenly assumed the media {{was talking about a}} second line transformed with concanavalin A (ConA), a Jack Bean lectin that is toxic to mammals. Transgenic ConA Potatoes had been developed, but had never been tested. Two press releases issued by the Rowett Institute on the 10th and 11th praised Pusztai's research and supported increased safety tests on genetically modified food. The press releases also said that the potatoes were modified with ConA, adding to the confusion. Pusztai claimed that he had not seen the press releases before <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> and had no opportunity to correct the mistake. James says that he drafted it and Pusztai rewrote one section, but did not see the final copy. The mistaken belief that the ConA gene was inserted into the potato led scientist Sir Robert May and Agricultural Minister Jack Cunningham to release statements to the media saying that the findings were not surprising, as a known poison had been added to the potato. Some scientists still dismiss Pusztai's work over this error.|$|E
5|$|In the 197778 season Villa {{reached the}} quarter-final of the UEFA Cup where <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> 43 on {{aggregate}} against Barcelona. In the domestic league, however, they struggled and Saunders started rebuilding the team. As Saunders began restructuring his {{team in the}} summer of 1979, there were more changes in the boardroom. Doug Ellis set a resolution to have several directors removed from the board. The resolution was not successful and as a result, Ellis resigned from the board. Meanwhile, Saunders brought in several new players who were to become some of Villa's most prolific players in terms of goals and appearances. Allan Evans, Ken McNaught and Kenny Swain were brought into the defence and Des Bremner was brought into the midfield to play alongside Dennis Mortimer and Gordon Cowans. Tony Morley and Gary Shaw were the new strike partnership. When Peter Withe was signed from Newcastle United {{in the summer of}} 1980, Saunders had built a team that was to see much success in the next few years.|$|E
5|$|The 2006–07 {{season was}} Liverpool's first after American {{businessmen}} George Gillett and Tom Hicks bought the club, {{in a deal}} which valued it and its outstanding debts at £218.9million. Liverpool once more came third in the league, this time 21 points behind Manchester United. <b>They</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> of both domestic cup competitions to Arsenal, but reached the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final where they again faced Milan. Unlike 2005, Liverpool were unable to recover from going behind, and lost the match 2–1. During the summer, Benítez strengthened his team by signing Fernando Torres for a club record £24million, and midfielders Ryan Babel and Yossi Benayoun. They drew thirteen of their 38 matches and finished the season in fourth place. Liverpool exited the FA and League Cup in the fifth round, but in the UEFA Champions League reached the semi-finals {{for the third time}} in four seasons, where they lost 4–3 on aggregate to Chelsea. Torres scored 33 goals in all competitions, and in the process broke two club records; he became the first Liverpool striker since Fowler to score more than 20 goals in a league season, and equalled Roger Hunt's run of scoring in consecutive league matches at Anfield (8).|$|E
