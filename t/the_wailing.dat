5|$|The Bhagavata Purana narrates {{further that}} the grief-stricken Rati goes mad by Kama's death {{and in the}} Matsya Purana and the Padma Purana versions, she smears herself with her husband's ashes. Further in Bhagavata Purana, Rati {{undergoes}} severe penance and pleads with Parvati to intercede with Shiva to restore her husband. Parvati reassures her that Kama would be reborn as Pradyumna, the son of Krishna, the Avatar of the god Vishnu on earth, and Rati should wait {{for him in the}} demon (asura) Sambara's house. In other versions of the narrative like the Matsya Purana, the Padma Purana, the Shiva Purana, the Linga Purana and the Kathasaritsagara, it is Shiva who blesses Rati with the boon of Kama's resurrection. In other variants, she curses the gods who sent Kama for this doomed mission and the gods, as a group or Brahma, seeks relief for the grieving Rati from Shiva or the Supreme Goddess, Parvati being one of her many manifestations. In some legends, like the one in the Brahmanda Purana, the Goddess revives Kama immediately, hearing the pleading of <b>the</b> <b>wailing</b> Rati and the gods. The renowned Sanskrit poet Kalidasa dedicates canto IV discussing the plight of Rati in his Kumarasambhava, which focuses on the story of the wedding of Shiva and Parvati and the birth of their son Skanda, who kills Tarakasura. Canto IV narrates that Rati witnesses the death of her husband and laments his death, and then tries to immolate herself on a funeral pyre. A heavenly voice stops her on time, stating that after the marriage of Shiva, he will revive her husband.|$|E

25|$|The {{long series}} of {{incidents}} connected with <b>the</b> <b>Wailing</b> Wall... These must {{be regarded as a}} whole, but the incident among them which in our view contributed most to the outbreak was the Jewish demonstration at <b>the</b> <b>Wailing</b> Wall on the 15th of August, 1929. Next in importance we put the activities of the Society for the Protection of the Moslem Holy Places and, in a lesser degree, of the Pro-Wailing Wall Committee.|$|E

25|$|Rav Kook wrote rulings {{presenting}} {{his strong}} opposition to people ascending the Temple Mount, {{due to the}} Jewish Laws of impurity. He felt that Jews should wait until {{the coming of the}} Messiah, when it will be encouraged to enter the Temple Mount. However, he was very careful to express the fact that <b>the</b> <b>Wailing</b> Wall and the Temple Mount were holy sites which belong to the Jews. Rav Kook also opposed the secular spirit of the Hatikvah anthem, and penned another anthem with a more religious theme entitled haEmunah.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, 16 August {{after an}} {{inflammatory}} sermon, a demonstration {{organized by the}} Supreme Muslim Council marched to the Wall.

At the Wall, the crowd burnt prayer books, liturgical fixtures and notes of supplication left in the Wall's cracks, and the beadle was injured. The rioting spread to the Jewish commercial area of town.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Sharon {{left the}} site, angry demonstrations by Palestinian Jerusalemites outside erupted into rioting.

Israeli police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, while protesters hurled stones and other projectiles, injuring 25 policemen, of whom one was seriously injured and had to be taken to hospital. At least three Palestinians were wounded by rubber bullets.|$|E
60|$|Tarzan {{almost had}} arrived at {{something}} tangible when a distant wail startled him from his preoccupation into sensibility of the present and <b>the</b> real. <b>The</b> <b>wail</b> came from <b>the</b> jungle at some little distance from Tarzan's swaying couch.

25|$|The Western Wall {{is one of}} the holiest of Jewish sites, sacred {{because it}} is a remnant of the ancient wall that once {{enclosed}} the Jewish Second Temple. The Jews, through the practice of centuries, had established a right of access to <b>the</b> <b>Wailing</b> Wall for the purposes of their devotions. As part of the Temple Mount the Western Wall was {{under the control of the}} Muslim religious trust, the Waqf. Muslims consider the wall to be part of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, and according to Islamic tradition the place where Muhammad tied his horse, Buraq, before his night journey to heaven. There had been a few serious incidents resulting from these differences.|$|E
25|$|Arlosoroff's {{hope for}} {{peaceful}} cooperation and compromise with Arabs would be severely tested. In 1929, the consciously aggressive Betar Youth Movement, organized under Ze'ev Jabotinsky's Union of Revisionist Zionists, {{took part in}} a coalition to assertively enforce and enlarge a Jewish presence in the proximity of <b>the</b> <b>Wailing</b> Wall. The activities of Betar and their associates inflamed an explosive reaction from the Arab community, as it was perceived Muslim mosques on the adjacent Temple Mount had been dishonored. The violent Western Wall Uprisings of 1929 ensued, which resulted in the loss of many lives, including civilians. Instead of inciting further Arab tensions, Arlosoroff strongly criticized the Revisionists for insensitively provoking the animosity.|$|E
25|$|After {{passing through}} the vestibule, Dante and Virgil reach the ferry that will take them across the river Acheron and to Hell proper. The ferry is piloted by Charon, who {{does not want to}} let Dante enter, for he is a living being. Virgil forces Charon to take him by declaring, Vuolsi così colà dove si puote / ciò che si vuole ("It is so willed there where is power to do / That which is willed"), {{referring}} to the fact that Dante is on his journey on divine grounds. <b>The</b> <b>wailing</b> and blasphemy of the damned souls entering Charon's boat contrast with the joyful singing of the blessed souls arriving by ferry in the Purgatorio. The passage across the Acheron, however, is undescribed, since Dante faints and does not awaken until he is on the other side.|$|E

Each of these calls communicates a distinct message. The frequency at which it vocalizes has been shown to vary based on time of day, weather, and season. It is most vocally active between mid-May and mid-June. <b>The</b> <b>wail,</b> yodel, and tremolo calls are sounded more frequently at night than during the day; calls have also been shown to occur more frequently in cold temperatures and when there is little to no rain.|$|R
25|$|Book Two {{features}} a traditional funeral for the Armenian dead, including the ceremonies of <b>the</b> <b>wailing</b> women, who {{assist in the}} birth of Aram Tomasian's son, a difficult delivery that is seen as ominous while conditions in the camp start to deteriorate, for the Armenian victories can only buy time. Jemal Pasha is introduced in Book Two and is portrayed as a resentful member of the triumvirate, pathologically jealous of Enver. The relationship between Bagradian and Iskuhi also comes into focus, as it is conducted openly but only consummated on a spiritual plane. Their love is interrupted by a reinforced Ottoman attack, which is repelled. Bagradian orders a massive forest fire, to surround the Armenian encampment with a no-man’s land of fire, smoke, and open terrain. Book Two ends with Sato exposing Juliette and Gonzague making love, Juliette coming down with typhus and Gonzague’s escape. Stephan leaves the camp with Haik, {{on a mission to}} contact the American envoy in Antioch.|$|E
25|$|It was Fala, my husband's little dog, {{who never}} really readjusted. Once, in 1945, when General Eisenhower came {{to lay a}} wreath on Franklin's grave, {{the gates of the}} regular {{driveway}} were opened and his automobile approached the house accompanied by <b>the</b> <b>wailing</b> of the sirens of a police escort. When Fala heard the sirens, his legs straightened out, his ears pricked up and I knew that he expected to see his master coming down the drive as he had come so many times. Later, when we were living in the cottage, Fala always lay near the dining-room door where he could watch both entrances just as he did when his master was there. Franklin would often decide suddenly to go somewhere and Fala had to watch both entrances in order to be ready to spring up and join the party on short notice. Fala accepted me after my husband's death, but I was just someone to put up with until the master should return.|$|E
25|$|The {{remainder}} of Book One describes which Armenians decide on resistance and which on {{cooperating with the}} deportation order. Bagradian camps out {{with his family and}} friends on Musa Dagh, to ensure that it is the right place to make a stand. Those who decide to resist, dig up a cache of rifles left over from the revolution of 1908, when they were allies of the Young Turks and subsequently bury their church bells, so that these do not fall into Turkish hands. Eventually the Ottoman military police, the dreaded saptiehs, arrive led by the red-haired müdir. They instruct the Armenians to prepare for deportations—- and then leave after beating Ter Haigasun and Bagradian. Instead of complying, the 6,000 Armenians march with everything they can carry, their animals and their weapons to a plateau on Musa Dagh. Bagradian hangs behind and observes <b>the</b> <b>wailing</b> women and the other graveyard folk—- who represent the old ways and sympathetic magic of pagan Armenia—- sacrifice a goat. Its meaning is propitious as well as cautionary. The chapter ends with Bagradian helping Krikor carry the last volumes of his magnificent if eclectic library to the Damlayik, the plateau the Armenians have chosen as their refuge.|$|E
