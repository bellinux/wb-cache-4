5|$|Early in the season, Bure {{sustained}} {{the first of}} several serious knee injuries during his career. On November 9, 1995, in a game against the Chicago Blackhawks, Bure was grabbed around the head by defenceman Steve Smith while approaching the end boards. Falling <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> he caught his skate against the boards, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his right knee. Requiring arthroscopic surgery, in which tendon was removed from his hamstring to repair the ACL, he was sidelined {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Leaving the Flames organization, McGrattan {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with the Anaheim Ducks, and was subsequently assigned to the AHL's San Diego Gulls for the 2015–16 season. During a January 19, 2016, game against the San Antonio Rampage, McGrattan was knocked unconscious {{in a fight with}} Daniel Maggio. The incident, in which he fell face-first <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> and had to be stretchered off the ice, renewed the debate over the place of fighting in hockey.|$|E
5|$|Morenz's {{daughter}} Marlene married Bernie Geoffrion, {{who also}} {{played for the}} Canadiens and Rangers, and was later inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. When the Canadiens retired Geoffrion's number {{on the night of}} his death on March 11, 2006, the team recognized the link between the two men. As Geoffrion's banner was being raised to the rafters, Morenz' banner was lowered halfway <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> Once Geoffrion's banner reached Morenz' banner, the two were raised together.|$|E

5|$|Natural ice {{typically}} had to {{be moved}} several times between being harvested and used by the end customer. A wide range of methods were used, including wagons, railroads, ships and barges. Ships were particularly important <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> trade, particularly in the early phase of the trade, when {{the focus of the}} trade was on international exports from the U.S. and railroad networks across the country were non-existent.|$|E
5|$|On November 23, 2013, in a {{match against}} the Montreal Canadiens, Glass broke his hand {{blocking}} a shot from P.K. Subban. He {{was placed on}} the injured reserve for 33 days before returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> on December 27 against the Carolina Hurricanes. On January 26, 2014, Glass registered 13 of the Penguins' 36 total hits in a loss to the Dallas Stars.|$|E
5|$|The Hitmen {{are active}} within the community, {{supporting}} numerous programs and charities. They host an annual teddy bear toss each December. The 13th annual Petro Canada Teddy Bear Toss, held on , 2007, saw what the Hitmen {{claim to be}} a world record 26,919 bears tossed on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> by 17,341 fans. The bears are donated to charities throughout the Calgary area. A few of the bears are personally delivered by the players to the Alberta Children's Hospital, an event highly anticipated by patients attending the hospital.|$|E
50|$|While the Doctor {{went out}} <b>to</b> {{negotiate}} with <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> Warriors, Tamsin stayed behind {{to make sure}} that the base's supervisor, Temperance Finch, didn't use the base's microwave emitters <b>to</b> kill <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> Warriors and their hostages. However, Professor Boston Schooner had already sabotaged the controls. As Tamsin had basically confessed to Gregson Grenville that she intended to sabotage them herself, she was imprisoned. The Doctor and Gregson, realising their mistake, freed Tamsin. Tamsin helped Gregson plant mining explosives <b>to</b> stop <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> Warriors.|$|R

5|$|The Nottingham Panthers were revived largely {{thanks to}} the efforts of Gary Keward. In 1980 the Ice Stadium directors, led by Charles Walker, agreed to a request by Keward to give ice hockey another chance. The Sheffield Lancers, a team Keward helped to run, were {{relocated}} to Nottingham taking the name of the team that had occupied the same building 20 years earlier. On 20 September 1980 the modern Panthers took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> for the first time defeating the Solihull Barons 7–4 at the Ice Stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} death {{directly}} related to a hockey fight occurred when Don Sanderson of the Whitby Dunlops, a top-tier senior amateur team in Ontario's Major League Hockey, died in January 2009, a month after sustaining a head injury during a fight: Sanderson's helmet came off during the fight, and when he fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> he hit his head. His death renewed calls to ban fighting among critics. In reaction, the league has stated that they are reviewing the players' use of helmets.|$|E
5|$|Types B and C live close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> pack, and diatoms {{in these}} waters may be {{responsible}} for the yellowish coloring of both types. Mitochondrial DNA sequences support the theory that these are recently diverged separate species. More recently, complete mitochondrial sequencing indicates the two Antarctic groups that eat seals and fish should be recognized as distinct species, as should the North Pacific transients, leaving the others as subspecies pending additional data. Advanced methods that sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome revealed systematic differences in DNA between different populations.|$|E

5|$|Williams was {{scheduled}} to perform at the Municipal Auditorium in Charleston, West Virginia on Wednesday December 31, 1952. Advance ticket sales totaled US$3,500. That day, because of an ice storm in the Nashville area, Williams could not fly, so he hired a college student, Charles Carr, to drive him to the concerts. Carr called the Charleston auditorium from Knoxville to say that Williams would not arrive on time owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> storm and was ordered to drive Williams to Canton, Ohio, for the New Year's Day concert there.|$|E
5|$|After Laser Wizard, Bufo, Forest Wizard, and—unwittingly—Ice King help a {{being named}} Bella Noche pass over into Wizard City, it reveals {{itself to be}} a {{creature}} of pure anti-magic. As such, the jewels from Ice King's crown are stripped of their magic, and Ice King reverts to his former self: Simon Petrikov (both voiced by Tom Kenny). Simon, initially unaware of where he is, steals a magic carpet from Ash (voiced by Steve Agee), flies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> Kingdom, and enters a hidden sanctum wherein elements of his previous life—such as books, artifacts, and his clothing—have been preserved. He phones Marceline, telling her to rush over and bring her stuffed teddy bear Hambo.|$|E
5|$|Altrincham {{is one of}} the few {{towns in}} North West England with an ice rink, and has had an ice hockey team since 1961, when Altrincham Ice Rink was built in Broadheath. The Altrincham Aces (later renamed the Trafford Metros) played from 1961 until 2003, when Altrincham Ice Rink closed. The town then had a three-year period without a rink or ice hockey team, until {{construction}} of the 2,500 capacity Altrincham Ice Dome was completed. Manchester Phoenix, a club having a professional presence in the English Premier Ice Hockey League and an extensive junior development aspect, relocated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> Dome during the 2006–07 season, having withdrawn from competition two years earlier due to the high cost of playing matches at Manchester's MEN Arena. In 2009 the Manchester Phoenix English National Ice Hockey League team was renamed Trafford Metros, bringing the old Altrincham team's name back into use. When not being used by Phoenix the Altrincham Ice Dome is open to the public for ice skating.|$|E

5|$|Entering the 1994 Stanley Cup Playoffs as {{the seventh}} seed, the Canucks {{went on a}} run to the Stanley Cup Finals. In the seventh game of the opening round series against the Calgary Flames, Bure scored {{one of the most}} {{significant}} and well-known goals in Canucks' history. After receiving a breakaway pass from defenceman Jeff Brown, he deked and scored on Flames' goalie Mike Vernon in the second overtime to win the series. In game two of the second round against the Dallas Stars, Bure knocked enforcer Shane Churla <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> with an elbow to the jaw. He also scored two goals in the game to help Vancouver to a 3–0 win. Although Bure was not initially penalized for the play, he was later fined $500 by the league. He recorded six goals and eight points in five games against the Dallas Stars, and against the Toronto Maple Leafs the following round scored four goals and six points in five games.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many large}} rorquals, the fin whale is a {{cosmopolitan}} species. It {{is found in}} all the world's major oceans and in waters ranging from the polar to the tropical. It is absent only from waters close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> pack at both {{the north and south}} extremities and relatively small areas of water away from the large oceans, such as the Red Sea although they can reach into the Baltic Sea, a marginal sea of such conditions. The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters. It is less densely populated in the warmest, equatorial regions.|$|E
5|$|Samuelsson {{struggled}} in the 2011 playoffs, {{as he returned}} from a lower-body injury that kept him from the six games {{near the end of}} the regular season. Recording three points over 11 games against the Blackhawks and Nashville Predators in the first two rounds, he was demoted at one point to the Canucks' fourth line in the second round against Nashville; it was suspected he was playing through an injury. In Game 5 of the second round against Nashville, he fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> while stretching to retrieve a loose puck and needed to be helped off the ice. Twelve days later, on May 19, he underwent surgery for his adductor tendon and a sports hernia, sidelining him for the remainder of the playoffs. With Samuelsson out of the lineup, Vancouver advanced to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated in seven games by the Boston Bruins.|$|E
50|$|When {{settlers}} {{first arrived}} at Blandford, {{in the winter}} they were able <b>to</b> walk over <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> <b>to</b> Tancook and to Chester. In 1845, Charles Lordly, Esq had goods hauled from Shoal Cove (Blandford) by three pairs of oxen and two horses over <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> <b>to</b> Tancook. <b>The</b> <b>ice</b> was cut with axes {{to a depth of}} two feet without finding water. The following month he had molasses and barrels of four hauled over <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> <b>to</b> Chester. Mr. Arch Zinck reported the last time people were able to walk <b>to</b> Tancook over <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> was 1932.|$|R

5|$|The Canadiens {{played the}} Chicago Black Hawks in Montreal on January 28, 1937. In the first period, Morenz {{went after the}} puck in the Chicago end while being chased by Black Hawks defenceman Earl Seibert. Morenz lost his balance and fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> {{crashing}} into the boards and catching his left skate in the wooden siding. Seibert, unable to stop, landed on him with full force. The resulting impact snapped Morenz's left leg, creating a noise heard throughout the rink. Helped to the Canadiens bench by his teammates, Morenz was taken to Hôpital St-Luc, where {{it was found that}} his leg was fractured in four places.|$|E
5|$|The fin whale's body is {{long and}} slender, {{coloured}} brownish-grey with a paler underside. The fin whale is a large baleen whale that belongs to the Cetacean order, which includes all species of whale, dolphin and porpoise. At least two recognized subspecies exist, in the North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere. It is found in all the major oceans, from polar to tropical waters. It is absent only from waters close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> pack at the poles and relatively small areas of water away from the open ocean. The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters. Its food consists of small schooling fish, squid, and crustaceans including copepods and krill.|$|E
5|$|The next {{vignette}} {{focuses on}} Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) {{as she tries}} to create the perfect sandwich using bizarre science. After exhausting herself going to extreme and ridiculous lengths to produce and combine all the ingredients perfectly, she offers the sandwich to Cinnamon Bun (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), who merely shoves it into his pastry body and belches foodstuff onto the princess. The action then shifts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> King (voiced by Tom Kenny), who smells a stench in his ice castle. After mistakenly assuming that the smell was being caused by Gunter the penguin's flatulence, the Ice King realizes that his armpits are actually the source of the smell. After taking a shower, he ponders aloud as to how he got so smelly. Gunter then proceeds to flatulate underneath his arms.|$|E
