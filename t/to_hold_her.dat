5|$|According to the Jomsvikinga Saga, Harald Bluetooth of Denmark ordered Queen Gunnhild be {{drowned in}} a bog. Based upon the belief of her royal personage, King Frederick VI of Denmark-Norway {{commanded}} an elaborately carved sarcophagus <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> body.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of her body on 31 January 2011, Yeates' family {{arranged}} <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> funeral at St Mark's of Ampfield, Hampshire, and have her interred in the churchyard. Yeates was buried on 11 February; approximately 300 people attended the service, which was led by vicar Peter Gilks.|$|E

Compassionate and caring, she goes as far as healing Butler from fatal wounds {{sustained}} fighting a troll, {{even though he has}} been integral in the plan <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> hostage—this act is the first step to changing Artemis' attitude and conscience.|$|E

5|$|Following law school, {{she was an}} {{associate}} at the Chicago office of the law firm Sidley & Austin, where she first met her future husband. At the firm, she worked on marketing and intellectual property. She continues <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> law license, but as she no longer needs it for her work, it {{has been on a}} voluntary inactive status since 1993.|$|E
5|$|On leaving {{university}} in June 1913, Wilkinson became a paid worker for the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS). She helped to organise the Suffrage Pilgrimage of July 1913, {{when more than}} 50,000 women marched {{from all over the}} country to a mass rally in Hyde Park, London. She began to develop a fuller understanding of the mechanics of politics and campaigning, and became an accomplished speaker, able <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> own even in the most hostile public meetings.|$|E
5|$|During that night, a storm blew up and {{approximately}} 200 soldiers {{were assigned to}} the task of restraining the airship in the gale-force winds. On Saturday morning, the wind was strong enough to pull some of the iron pickets anchoring the airship out of the ground so that she swung broadside to the wind, causing her to tip on her side, which in turn caused sacks of ballast to be released. Even then the Patrie could have been saved; had the release cord been attached to the gas-bag, a single tug on the cord would have been enough to release the hydrogen and save the ship. An oversight led to this not being done, the troops were unable to keep control her and thus could not continue <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> down in the storm.|$|E

Mulder faces his phobia {{and is able to}} save the Marsden children. Scully holds L'Ively at gunpoint, but is forced <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> fire when L'Ively informs her of the rocket fuel he has painted on the house. However, Green throws a can of rocket fuel in his face, causing him to lose control and set himself alight outside.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} that summer, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin {{reported}} that she was too frail <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> birthday reception for the public, an annual tradition dating {{back to the days of}} the monarchy. As one of her last public appearances in September, she officially became a member of the American Red Cross. Following several months of deteriorating health that left her without the use of her lower limbs, as well as a diminished mental capacity rendering her incapable of recognizing her own house, her inner circle of friends and caregivers sat vigil for the last two weeks of her life knowing the end was near. In accordance with Hawaiian tradition, the royal kāhili fanned her as she lay in bed. On the morning of November 11, Liliʻuokalani died at the age of seventy-nine at her residence at Washington Place.|$|E
5|$|During Christmas, Edward carves an angelic ice {{sculpture}} {{modeled after}} Kim; the ice shavings are {{thrown into the}} air and fall like snow, a rarity for the neighborhood. Kim dances in the snowfall. Jim arrives and calls out to Edward, surprising him and causing him to accidentally cut Kim's hand. Jim accuses Edward of intentionally harming Kim, but Kim, fed up with Jim's jealousy, breaks up with him. Edward runs off in a rage, destroying his works until he is calmed by a stray dog. Kim tells her parents what happened, and they set out to find Edward. Edward returns to the Boggs home to find Kim and Kevin there. Kim tries apologizing for Jim's behavior and asks him <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>her,</b> but Edward fears he will hurt her. Jim drives around in a drunken rage and nearly runs over Kevin, but Edward pushes Kevin to safety, inadvertently cutting him. Jim tells those witnessing the event that Edward is attacking Kevin, and he tries attacking Edward. Edward defends himself, cutting Jim's arm, and then flees to the mansion.|$|E

50|$|His {{daughter}} roundly scolded him {{for bringing}} Billie {{with him to}} watch her race (she races cars) and Steve blamed himself when Stephanie was critically injured during the race. Tearfully at her bedside, he had a flashback <b>to</b> <b>holding</b> <b>her</b> as a baby. He still doesn't remember Kayla, but now he remembers Stephanie and he's terrified of how much it hurts to love her, especially as she lies near deaths door.|$|R
5|$|The {{story begins}} in the pre-dawn hours as the young Nick Adams, his father, his uncle and their Indian guides row across a lake to a nearby Indian camp. Nick's father, a doctor, has been called out to deliver a baby {{for a woman who}} has been in labor for days. At the camp, they find the woman in a cabin lying on a bottom bunkbed; her husband lies above her with an injured foot. Nick's father is forced to perform a {{caesarian}} operation on the woman with a jack-knife because the baby is in the breech position; he asks Nick to assist by holding a basin. The woman screams throughout the operation, and when Nick's uncle tries <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> down, she bites him. After the baby is delivered, Nick's father turns to the woman's husband on the top bunk and finds that he fatally slit his throat with a straight razor during the operation. Nick is sent out of the cabin, and his uncle leaves with two Natives, not to return. The story ends with only Nick and his father on the lake, rowing away from the camp. Nick asks his father questions about birth and death, and thinks to himself that he will never die, as he watches his father row.|$|E

25|$|Sinn Féin made a {{breakthrough}} in the Dublin constituency in 2004. The party's candidate, Mary Lou McDonald, was elected on the sixth count as one of four MEPs for Dublin, effectively taking the seat of Patricia McKenna of the Green Party. In the 2009 election, when Dublin's representation was reduced to three MEPs, she failed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> seat. In the South constituency their candidate, Councillor Toiréasa Ferris, managed to nearly {{double the number of}} first preference votes, lying third after the first count, but failed to get enough transfers to win a seat.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, Passman {{dismissed}} {{a female}} employee from his office, Shirley Davis, because he preferred a man <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> position. Davis sued Passman {{and won a}} judgment, affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1979 (Davis v. Passman), which held that Passman's action constituted sexual discrimination. The case remains an important precedent in holding {{that there is an}} implied right of action against U.S. congressmen for such discrimination. As such, it recognized a citizen's right to bring a suit against elected federal representatives for violation of constitutional rights.|$|E
25|$|After {{her debut}} in the short film Sailors, Beware!, Vélez {{appeared}} in another short film for Hal Roach, What Women Did for Me, opposite Charley Chase. Later that year, she did a screen test for the upcoming Douglas Fairbanks film The Gaucho. Fairbanks was reportedly impressed by Vélez and quickly signed her to a contract and hired her {{to appear in the}} film with him. Upon its release in 1927, The Gaucho was a hit and critics were duly impressed with Vélez's ability <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> own alongside Fairbanks, who was well known for his spirited acting and impressive stunts.|$|E

25|$|After her {{affair with}} her lover and adviser Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin ended in 1776, he {{allegedly}} selected a candidate-lover for her who had the physical beauty and mental faculties <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> interest (such as Alexander Dmitriev-Mamonov and Nicholas Alexander Suk). Some of these men loved her in return, and she always showed generosity towards them, even after the affair ended. One of her lovers, Pyotr Zavadovsky, received 50,000 rubles, a pension of 5,000 rubles, and 4,000 peasants in Ukraine after she dismissed him in 1777. The last of her lovers, Prince Zubov, was 40 years her junior. Her sexual independence led {{to many of the}} legends about her.|$|E
25|$|The West adopted {{many of the}} Byzantine {{iconographic}} elements, but {{preferred the}} stable rather than the cave, though Duccio's Byzantine-influenced Maestà version tries to have both. The midwives gradually dropped out from Western depictions, as Latin theologians disapproved of these legends; sometimes the bath remains, either being got ready or with Mary bathing Jesus. The midwives are still seen where Byzantine influence is strong, especially in Italy; as in Giotto, one may hand Jesus over to his mother.
