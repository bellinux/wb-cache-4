40|$|Food {{materials}} are highly perishable. Drying {{is necessary to}} restrict biological and chemical activity to extend shelf life. A good drying model is useful for design of a better dryer, evaluation of dryer performance, prediction of product quality, and optimization. The reaction engineering approach (REA) is a simple-lumped parameter model revealed to be accurate and robust to model drying of various thin layers or small objects. Modeling drying behavior of different sizes is essential for a good drying model, yet it is still very challenging, even for a traditional diffusion-based model, which requires several sets of experiments to generate the diffusivity function. <b>The</b> <b>REA</b> is implemented in this study, for the first time, to model drying of rather thick samples of food materials. An approximate spatial distribution of sample temperature is introduced and combined with <b>the</b> <b>REA</b> to <b>model</b> drying kinetics. Results have indicated that <b>the</b> <b>REA</b> can <b>model</b> both moisture content and temperature profiles. The accuracy and effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>REA</b> to <b>model</b> drying of thick samples of food {{materials are}} revealed in this study.

40|$|The Resources-Events-Agents (REA) {{model is}} a {{semantic}} data model for the development and integration of conceptual schemas of accounting information systems.

40|$|Databases are an {{important}} part of most computer-based information systems. As such, the design of a database has also gained importance because a bad design will compromise data integrity as well as make it inefficient in its use of resources. This paper compares the effect of two data modeling approaches on the design of a database, specifically the Entity-Relationship Model (ER Model) and the Resources-Events -Agents Model (REA Model). First, the sales/collection cycle of a fictional case study is described. Then, an ER Model and a REA Model are independently created based on this case study. Finally, one database design is created based on the ER Model, and another database design is created based on <b>the</b> <b>REA</b> <b>Model.</b> The outcome of this experiment shows that both approaches produced similar database designs, but the design processes were different in their complexity, structurally, and completeness.

40|$|AbstractSludge drying is an {{essential}} step to reduce the cost of waste treatment but design of sewage sludge dryer is still relatively complicated since the drying kinetics is influenced signficantly by shrinkage, cracking and skin formation which occur during drying.

The equilibrium activation energy (ΔEv,b) is evaluated according to the corresponding drying air humidity and temperature.
