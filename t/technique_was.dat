5|$|A new {{construction}} <b>technique</b> <b>was</b> employed to save weight. Previous battlecruisers were built {{with a combination}} of transverse and longitudinal steel frames; the Derfflinger-class ships dispensed with the transverse frames and used only the longitudinal ones. This enabled the ship to retain structural strength and a lower weight. As with all preceding capital ships, the outer hull spaces between the hull wall and the torpedo bulkhead were used for coal storage.|$|E

5|$|A <b>technique</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} that combined the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses.

5|$|Baggio was a tactically {{versatile}} player, with a {{good understanding}} of the game, and was comfortable attacking on both wings or through the centre of the pitch; this allowed him to play anywhere along the front-line. His preferred position was in a free-role, as a creative, attacking midfield playmaker, although he was rarely deployed in this position throughout his career due to the prevalence of the 4–4–2 formation, in which he usually functioned as a striker. It was only in later years he was able to play in this free role more frequently. A prolific goalscorer, Baggio was an accurate finisher from {{both inside and outside the}} area, known for his composure in front of goal. Due to his excellent technique, he was a precise volleyer and a set piece specialist, renowned for his accurate bending shots and free-kicks. His free-kick technique influenced several other players, such as Alessandro Del Piero and Andrea Pirlo. During his time with Juventus, his free kick <b>technique</b> <b>was</b> described as cross between that of Maradona's, Zico's, and Platini's, as at the time, his ball-striking <b>technique</b> <b>was</b> thought to resemble Platini's, although, like Zico and Maradona, he preferred to take free kicks from close range, usually from a distance of around 20 to 16 metres from the goal, or even just outside the area, and to have the ball touched by a teammate first before striking it. Despite his decisive miss in the 1994 World Cup final shootout, Baggio was also a penalty kick specialist.|$|E

Bolt did not win any gold medals at the major tournaments in 2007, but Mills felt that Bolt's <b>technique</b> <b>was</b> much improved, pinpointing improvements in Bolt's balance at the turns over 200 m and an increase in his stride frequency, giving him more driving power on the track.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s, the {{telescope}} surface was becoming badly corroded. In 2001–2003, {{the telescope}} was resurfaced, increasing its sensitivity at 5GHz {{by a factor}} of five. A holographic profiling <b>technique</b> <b>was</b> used on the surface, meaning that the surface works optimally at wavelengths of 5cm (compared to 18cm on the old surface). A new drive system was installed, which provides a much higher pointing accuracy. The outer track was relaid, and the focal tower was strengthened so that it could support heavier receivers.|$|E
5|$|By {{the period}} of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Babylonian astronomers were making {{systematic}} observations of the positions and behavior of the planets. For Mars, they knew, for example, that the planet made 37 synodic periods, or 42 circuits of the zodiac, every 79 years. The Babylonians invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of the planets. This <b>technique</b> <b>was</b> primarily derived from timing measurements—such as when Mars rose above the horizon, rather than from the less accurately known position of the planet on the celestial sphere.|$|E

40|$|Two {{computational}} <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> {{developed to}} calculate the compressible vortex-dominated flows.

5|$|Del Piero {{was a free}} {{kick and}} penalty kick (62 goals from {{penalties}}) specialist. He is the third highest scorer of penalties in Serie A history, scoring 50 times out of 61 attempts, behind only Francesco Totti and Roberto Baggio. Del Piero's unique free kick <b>technique</b> <b>was</b> usually characterised by a curling strike which rose high over the wall, and then suddenly dropped into the top corner of the goal; he attributes his ability on set pieces to the time spent studying Roberto Baggio in training during their time together at Juventus, and was also influenced by the free kick technique {{of one of his}} idols, Platini. Indeed, in his early years with the Turin club, Del Piero's free kick <b>technique</b> <b>was</b> compared to that of the Frenchman, as he preferred to strike the ball from a distance of around 20 metres from the goal, with a direct kick, rather than having it touched by a teammate first. Del Piero is currently the Italian all-time top scorer from free kicks in all competitions (52 goals: 46 goals at club level, 6 goals with the Italy national team). He is also the third all-time highest goalscorer of free kicks in Serie A, with 22 goals, behind only Andrea Pirlo and Siniša Mihajlović. In addition to his talent and footballing abilities, Del Piero also drew praise throughout his career for his leadership with Juventus, and for his fair play and correct behaviour on the pitch.|$|E

5|$|Galileo {{was able}} to develop a method of {{determining}} longitude based on {{the timing of the}} orbits of the Galilean moons. The times of the eclipses of the moons could be precisely calculated in advance, and compared with local observations on land or on ship to determine the local time and hence longitude. The main problem with the <b>technique</b> <b>was</b> that it was difficult to observe the Galilean moons through a telescope on a moving ship; a problem that Galileo tried to solve with the invention of the celatone. The method was used by Cassini and Picard to re-map France.|$|E
40|$|Several <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> {{presented}} to perform static and dynamic load balancing schemes for integrated vision systems. These <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> novel {{in the sense}} that they capture the computational requirements of a task by examining the data when they are produced. Furthermore, they can be applied to many integrated vision systems because many algorithms in different systems are either the same or have similar computational characteristics.

40|$|With {{everyday}} passing, {{power generation}} from photovoltaic (PV) systems are getting increased around the globe. One of the drawbacks of PV systems {{is that they}} exhibit non-linear I-V curves with respect to atmospheric conditions. Therefore, maximum power point tracker (MPPT) <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> installed in every PV system. One {{of the most popular}} <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> perturb & observe (P&O) but this technique has some shortcomings. In this paper, MPPT <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> proposed which will optimize the P&O with respect to distributed PV (DPV) plant. Such that the deficiencies of P&O are removed. The proposed <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> designed for DPV and is working in two modes. In mode- 1, decision making of the proposed technique revolves around the mutual co-ordination between two modules/arrays. During this mode, one array will behave as leader (L) while other array as follower (F). In mode- 2, proposed technique utilizes the individual P&O for both arrays. Model is the superior performance mode in which efficiency of the proposed <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> better than P&O. While, in mode- 2 both techniques have same efficiency.
