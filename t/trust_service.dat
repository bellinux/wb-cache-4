40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} preventing the successful use of current electronic commerce systems is the users lack of trust in such systems. Current solutions focus on providing secure communication and authentification methods. It is commonly argued that such methods will increase trust between users and electronic marketplaces. However, trust among companies acting as business partners on business-to-business electronic marketplaces is not addressed in these solutions. This form of trust is of particular importance for {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} that require support for the negotiation phase through the marktplace. In this thesis <b>trust</b> <b>services</b> based on the concept of traceability are introduced. In particular, the trust between users of electronic marktplaces is addressed. To create the <b>services,</b> a <b>trust</b> model based on elements from computer science, psychology, and sociology is developed. This models demands a trustworthy realisation of the services. To this end, the principle of a distributed trusted third party is introduced. Here a network of trusted third parties is used as a <b>service</b> provider for <b>trust</b> <b>services.</b> A service environment based on web services is developed for the technical realisation of the <b>trust</b> <b>services.</b> Using the environment, users of a marketplace can then select and configure <b>trust</b> <b>services</b> to their needs and preferences. This combination of <b>trust</b> <b>services</b> with the realisation through distributed trusted third parties can thus be used to enhance trust on electronic marketplaces...|$|R
