5|$|Casualty Clearing Stations were {{deliberately}} sited {{as close}} to the front line as possible, since many injuries caused during battle required more urgent attention than the time to travel to a field hospital allowed. Often within seven miles of the front line, they were considered extremely dangerous, and <b>the</b> <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> having nurses attend such stations was hotly debated within the military. As a result of its proximity to the front, the station would often come under enemy attack, as was the case of the 38th British Casualty Station on 23 August. The Casualty Station suffered a heavy air raid by German forces, with the sterilisation room being destroyed and the camp being hit by numerous bombs. Despite the heavy attack, Corkhill, who was attending to the wounded at the time, remained calm and continued to aid the patients. For her actions, she was recommended for and later awarded the Military Medal.|$|E

Saldías pointed out that, since there was no act of foundation of Pichilemu nor record of date of the first inhabitation of the area by the Promaucaes, the date of 24 January 1544, specified in the title of encomienda of Topocalma given by Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia to Juan Gómez de Almagro, another conquistador, was the most correct date to be used to commemorate the anniversary of Pichilemu. The current territory of Pichilemu was part of the encomienda of Topocalma.|$|E
5|$|Stace {{was praised}} for his clarity and ambitious aims in Time and Eternity by Abraham Kaplan who {{believed}} {{the book was}} one of the best on the subject for many many years. He pointed out that the book’s distinction between the orders of time and eternity owed much to Kant (which Stace himself acknowledged). Kaplan reflected that it was the book’s emphasis placed on mysticism and a universal religious intuition that would be of particular interest to students of “Oriental and comparative philosophy”. The central idea upon which Stace’s thought stands or falls, for Kaplan, is that religious language is evocative rather than descriptive. In this both religionists and naturalists will find problems. For the former, Stace can only account for <b>the</b> <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> religious language by relying on ‘nearness’ to the divine rather than on resemblance, and this relies on ‘a vague panpsychism’ and levels of being in the manner of Samuel Alexander. While for the naturalist, Stace’s system of religious symbolism is doomed to remain mysterious, because it does not allow religious metaphors to be translated literally and neither can it be said how they evoke the experience to which they refer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—There is {{a rising}} concern among parents that mobile {{advertisements}} may contain violent and sexual content {{even when the}} app itself is safe for children. Because mobile advertisements are not controlled by the content rating of apps, unexpected objectionable contents may occur and be harmful to children’s mental health. This study {{is the first to}} explore <b>the</b> content <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> in-app advertisements on mobile devices from children’s online safety perspective. We find in-app advertisements are common in the free apps designed for children on smart platforms. Experimental results show that a large percent of the in-app advertisements carry inappropriate contents for children. Unfortunately, neither mobile platforms nor advertising networks provide maturity policies to restrict <b>the</b> content <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> in-app advertisements. This research suggests that these challenges cannot easily be tackled by one entity. Instead, advertisement providers, advertising networks, app developers, and mobile platforms should collaborate in developing policies and mechanisms to monitor <b>the</b> content <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> in-app advertisements.
