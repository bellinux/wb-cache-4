40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{the first evidence}} for melanosclerites and foraminiferal test-linings from the Cambrian. While agglutinated foraminifera are known from the Precambrian–Cambrian transition, their tests are delicate and not commonly recovered from acid-digested samples. The material presented herein represents the organic test-linings, which preserve sufficient detail of the internal morphology of the foraminiferal test wall and gross morphology to allow identification to generic level. The occurrence of melanosclerites documented herein, extends their lower range from the Middle Ordovician to the Lower Cambrian and includes Semenola semen Schallreuter 1981, Melanosteus sp. Eisenack 1942 and Melanoclava sp. Eisenack 1942. Foraminiferal taxa include Psammosphaera Schulze 1875, Thurammina? Brady 1879, and a small tubular form (Bathysiphon?), which supplements the previously described records of Platysolenites spp., Spirosolenites spiralis Glaessner 1979 and Psammosphaera sp., which are known from their agglutinated tests rather than the <b>test-lining.</b> This also extends the first occurrence datum of Psammosphaera and Thurammina? to the Platysolenites partial range zone of the Lower Cambrian. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{perceive}} depth from binocular disparities the visual {{system has to}} identify matching features of the two retinal images. Normally, the assigned disparity is unambiguously determined by monocularly visible matching constraints. The assigned disparity is ambiguous when matching is unconstrained, such as when we view an isolated long oblique disparate line. Recently we found {{that in order to}} perceive a depth probe at the same depth as the oblique line, the probe needs to have the same horizontal disparity as the line (i. e. matching occurs along horizontal “search-zones” [Vis. Res. 40 (2000) 151]). Here we examined whether the depth probe disparity in unconstrained matching of long lines is influenced by cyclovergence, by cyclorotation between stereogram half-images, or by combinations of the two. We measured retinal rotation (> 6 deg in cyclovergence conditions). We found that in those conditions in which the retinal images were the same (a condition with, say, both zero cyclovergence and zero cyclorotation between the half-images, creates the same retinal images as a condition with both 6 deg cyclovergence and 6 deg cyclorotation) assigned depth was the same too, i. e. independent of cyclovergence. Thus, the assigned depth of the <b>test-line</b> seems to be determined solely by the retinal <b>test-line</b> orientation, implying that the binocular matching algorithm does not seem to incorporate the eyes’ cyclovergence when matching is unconstrained...|$|E

30|$|Test {{flights were}} flown along a 6 km test line with {{readings}} taken every 0.1 second or approximately every 6 metres. The aircraft used was a De Havilland DHC- 6 twin Otter (registration number C-GSGF) for all survey work. A {{map of the}} <b>test-line</b> is given in the left panel of Fig. 1. One end of the test line, for approximately 1 km, was over the sea. There were 5 individual flights on different days and each of these flew {{up and down the}} line changing altitude after each turn to give 7 different altitudes, nominally at 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85 and 90 m. Although a target altitude was set fluctuations were unavoidable and actual altitudes were also recorded via a laser altimeter. Measurements were collected at four different frequencies: 912, 3005, 11962 and 24510 Hz referred to henceforth as 0.9, 3, 12 and 25 KHz. Negative values of apparent resistivity were ignored and replaced by interpolation from neighbouring measurement points.|$|E
30|$|We do {{not attempt}} to {{quantify}} any error in the apparent resistivity arising from sources other than the altitude of the flight and its position across the test line route. Furthermore, the relationship between repeatability, which we estimate via a variance computation, does not necessarily correspond {{to a reduction in}} bias. As we will show, in nearly all cases the flights that were most repeatable were those where the aircraft was aiming to fly at the lowest altitudes. This suggests that future flights to determine apparent resistivity should also be conducted at the lowest feasible altitude. However, it is possible (though unlikely) that apparent resistivity data from flights taken at the lowest altitude also contain considerable bias, and that a higher altitude may be preferable when considering both repeatability and bias simultaneously. While data for actual ground-based apparent resistivity measurements for a short 300 m section of the flight <b>test-line</b> was available, these data were insufficient to examine this potential bias, so we leave this as a topic for further research.|$|E
30|$|While it is {{generally}} recognised that repeatability {{is an important part}} of AEM surveys [6] few studies have been published. Most studies that do mention repeatability assess it by repeating a <b>test-line</b> flight daily or on a number of occasions at a single altitude [7, 8]. For example, Green and Lane [9] analysed AEM data from a flight-line flown repeatedly at a single target altitude to monitor system performance. They described an approximate method for correcting for altitude and obtained a good measure of the repeatability after applying this correction. Foged et al. [10] investigated repeatability of airborne and ground-based TEM systems at three different altitudes (10, 20 and 30 m) and concluded that results were satisfactorily repeatable within and between altitudes, and that there was good agreement with a ground-based reference section. A more extensive study of repeatability was carried out by Huang and Cogbill [11] in which they concluded that spatially consistent flight paths are required for repeatability analysis of the EM data, and that this analysis is more meaningful if the apparent resistivity is used instead of the EM response itself. Our paper is an attempt to follow and validate this recommendation.|$|E
40|$|Background {{and aims}} This paper {{provides}} an overview of the measuring capabilities of IJ_Rhizo, an ImageJ macro that measures scanned images of washed root samples. IJ_Rhizo is open-source, platform-independent and offers a simple graphic user interface (GUI) for a main audience of non-programmer scientists. Being open-source based, it is also fully modifiable to accommodate the specific needs of the more computer-literate users. A comparison of IJ_Rhizo's performance with that of the widely used commercial package WinRHIZO™ is discussed. Methods We compared IJ_Rhizo's performance with that of the commercial package WinRHIZO™ using two sets of images, one comprising <b>test-line</b> images, the second consisting of images of root samples collected in the field. IJ_Rhizo and WinRHIZO™ estimates were compared by means of correlation and regression analysis. Results IJ_Rhizo "Kimura" and WinRHIZO™ "Tennant" were the length estimates that were best linearly correlated with each other. Correlation between average root diameter estimates was weaker, due to the sensitivity of this parameter to thresholding and filtering of image background noise. Conclusions Overall, IJ_Rhizo offers new opportunities for researchers who cannot afford the cost of commercial software packages to carry out automated measurement of scanned images of root samples, without sacrificing accuracy.

40|$|Gryaab AB, {{which runs}} the Rya plant in Gothenburg has {{expanded}} its wastewater treatment plant with a new nitrogen and phosphorus removal facility, this {{in order to achieve}} the new target values concerning emissions of nitrogen and phosphorus. The new conditions is 0. 3 mg/l phosphorus and 10 mg/l nitrogen in the effluent per calendar year. The new nitrogen removal is a post-denitrification plant where bacterias are growing in suspended carriers, so called MBBR-technology. Since this type of biological treatment technology is relatively new there is not so much knowledge about how to operate it to obtain the most effective capacity. The post-denitrification plant at the Rya has six denitrification lines, each line consists of three reactor zones. First zone is designed to be used both as a nitrification- and denitrifikation zone. The thesis aims to study how different nitrate load affects the denitrification capacity. The method for studying the capacity is based on having a test line with low nitrate (NO 3) load, 85 NO 3 kg / day and a reference line with a high nitrate load, 288 NO 3 kg / day. A flow control is used to give a constant nitrate load to the line by regulating the flow of the incoming nitrate concentration [...] Denitrification tests are performed to study the changes in the capacity when the nitrate load is altered. The tests are designed to to simulate the condition in the full-scale plant, i. e. oxygen free environment and the carriers under constant suspension. The tests shows the denitrification rate of the bacteria in the postdenitrification plant, and thus the denitrification capacity. During 10 weeks the denitrification in the post-denitrification plant were studied. The first experimental period the <b>test-line</b> had low nitrate load, followed by a period in which the <b>test-line</b> had high nitrate load, and finally a period in which the nitrate load was again low. The reference line had during the study high nitrate load, 288 NO 3 kg/day. The results show that at low nitrate load the capacity diminishes for 13 - 14 days and then stabilizes. Repeatability at low nitrate load exists and with a nitrate load of 85 kg NO 3 / day the capacity stabilizes at approximately 1, 1 - 1, 3 gN/m 2 /d. In the study with high nitrate load, 288 NO 3 kg/day the capacity has already increased after 9 days from about 1, 1 to 1, 8 gN/m 2 /d gN/m 2 /d. The highest denitrification capacity value observed was 2, 2 gN/m 2 /d...|$|E
40|$|Electromigration is a {{metallization}} {{failure mechanism}} {{that is of}} concern for VLSI relia-( [...] f bility. Ambiguities exist in the electromigration characterization of metallizations. These ambiguities are, in general, due to the different test structures and measurement methods used and to the incomplete reporting of the results from such characterizations. ~ I I An interlaboratory experiment has been organized to address this problem. The purpose of the experiment is to assess the reproducibility of electromigration characterizations and to r establish the technical base needed to develop guidelines {{for the design of}} electromigration test structures, for methods to measure the median-time-to-failure (tso) of metallizations, and for reporting characterization measurements. Fourteen laboratories have volunteered to participate in the experiment. A A test chip, NBS- 42, was designed for this experiment and is shown in Fig. 1. Each quadrant *of the chip has five <b>test-line</b> structures for electromigration stress tests and is intended to be packaged separately. Quadrants 1 through 3 have structures with straight test lines that have designed lengths of 400, 800, and 1200 pm, respectively. The structures in quadrant 4 have 1200 -/m long test lines with right-angle turns. These different structures will allow a determination of any dependences of t 50 on test line length and on right-angle turns...|$|E
40|$|Electric Vehicles (EVs) {{have been}} {{suggested}} as alternatives to conventional vehicles for reducing petrol consumption and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. When {{a large number of}} EVs connect to the grid, they can cause a large amount of power loss. Where to install multiple charge stations in the grid, so as to mitigate losses caused by EVs when providing energy to those EVs, is becoming vitally important. In this paper, a distribution test-network model is described. A new analytical method is proposed, using the stations' cooperation in terms of optimal active and reactive power dispatch as well as power flow analysis for locating the optimal placement of charge stations, so as to reduce power losses. This method is compared with the previously developed current density method for single charge stations using system simulation results. It was demonstrated that the methods proposed in this paper are more accurate than the current density method, and that 17 % of the average active power loss can be saved for three different types of load profile. In addition, 27 % of the average active power loss was saved by installing two charge stations rather than no charge stations in the <b>test-line.</b> It is shown that this could represent a 2. 6 % annual yield above inflation for investing in installing and running such charge stations...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our research}} was to develop and demonstrate seismic data-acquisition and data-processing technologies that allow geothermal prospects below high-velocity rock outcrops to be evaluated. To do this, we acquired a 3 -component seismic test line across an area of exposed high-velocity rocks in Brewster County, Texas, where there is high heat flow and surface conditions mimic those found at numerous geothermal prospects. Seismic contractors have not succeeded in creating good-quality seismic data in this area for companies who have acquired data {{for oil and gas}} exploitation purposes. Our test profile traversed an area where high-velocity rocks and low-velocity sediment were exposed on the surface in alternating patterns that repeated along the test line. We verified that these surface conditions cause non-ending reverberations of Love waves, Rayleigh waves, and shallow critical refractions to travel across the earth surface between the boundaries of the fast-velocity and slow-velocity material exposed on the surface. These reverberating surface waves form the high level of noise in this area that does not allow reflections from deep interfaces to be seen and utilized. Our data-acquisition method of deploying a box array of closely spaced geophones allowed us to recognize and evaluate these surface-wave noise modes regardless of the azimuth direction to the surface anomaly that backscattered the waves and caused them to return to the <b>test-line</b> profile. With this knowledge of the surface-wave noise, we were able to process these <b>test-line</b> data to create P-P and SH-SH images that were superior to those produced by a skilled seismic data-processing contractor. Compared to the P-P data acquired along the test line, the SH-SH data provided a better detection of faults and could be used to trace these faults upward to the boundaries of exposed surface rocks. We expanded our comparison of the relative value of S-wave and P-wave seismic data for geothermal applications by inserting into this report {{a small part of the}} interpretation we have done with 3 C 3 D data across Wister geothermal field in the Imperial Valley of California. This interpretation shows that P-SV data reveal faults (and by inference, also fractures) that cannot be easily, or confidently, seen with P-P data, and that the combination of P-P and P-SV data allows VP/VS velocity ratios to be estimated across a targeted reservoir interval to show where an interval has more sandstone (the preferred reservoir facies). The conclusion reached from this investigation is that S-wave seismic technology can be invaluable to geothermal operators. Thus we developed a strong interest in understanding the direct-S modes produced by vertical-force sources, particularly vertical vibrators, because if it can be demonstrated that direct-S modes produced by vertical-force sources can be used as effectively as the direct-S modes produced by horizontal-force sources, geothermal operators can acquire direct-S data across many more prospect areas than can be done with horizontal-force sources, which presently are limited to horizontal vibrators. We include some of our preliminary work in evaluating direct-S modes produced by vertical-force sources...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{reproductive}} {{performance of the}} high-fat (HF) and low-fat (LF) lines was studied after the second (S 2) and third (S 3) cycles of selection for or against abdominal fat. In each generation, 70 females and 20 males {{from each of the}} selection lines were studied. The HF line had about twice as much abdominal fat at 9 weeks of age, while its mean body weight was equal to that of the LF line. The two lines had similar egg production at the S 2 generation, but at the S 3 generation, the mean egg production of one-year-old hens was 118 vs. 108 eggs in the LF and HF lines, respectively. The eggs of the LF hens were heavier than those of the HF ones by 2 to 3 g, in both generations. The hatchability of the LF eggs was significantly better (by 20 to 30 %) than that of the HF eggs in both generations. Crosses of S 2 males and females from the HF and LF lines in all four combinations, and crosses with a standard White Rock <b>test-line,</b> revealed that only the dams of the selection lines had a significant effect on hatchability. Mean albumen dry-matter content was significantly higher in the LF eggs than in the HF eggs (12 4 % and 11. 7 %, respectively) The average amount of albumen dry-matter per egg was 10 to 13 % larger in LF eggs than in HF eggs. The results suggest that the selection for or against abdominal fat at the broiler stage affected the amount of the total albumen dry matter, which could be related to the dif-ference in hatchability between the lines...|$|E
40|$|My Bachelor´s thesis {{deals with}} the {{examination}} of celiac disease in connection to osteoporosis. The aim of the thesis was to specify the level of antidotes against tissue transglutaminase in the class IgA and IgG in the serum with osteoporosis diagnosed patients, to interpret, {{based on the results}} of the study, possible link between osteoporosis and celiac disease as well as to compare the outcome with scientific data. I focused on the present knowledge of osteoporosis and celiac disease in the first part. As for celiac disease, I described its history and characteristics. I also paid attention to diagnostics of celiac disease with the assistance of laboratory serological tests ELISA. I mentioned the free-gluten diet treatment after that. As regards osteoporosis, I described its history, symptoms, forms, perils and complications which the disease causes. I conducted the methodical part of my work in the biochemical haematological laboratory Stafila where I work, with its seat in České Budějovice. As for measurements, I took them in the department of microbiology, where immunologic tests are also taken. I carried out the screening of celiac disease from serum, namely the determination of antidotes against tissue transglutaminase in the class IgA and IgG, with the aid of ELISA - a sandwich method. I took measurements with 58 osteoporosis diagnosed patients. I obtained the sera thanks to the supervisor of my thesis Mrs. Marie Ládová, who is at the head of an osteological outpatient department in České Budějovice. I stated the serological markers of celiac disease with the assistance of enzymatic immunoanalysis conducted on automatic analyzer Nexgen Four, which was provided by the firm <b>Test-Line.</b> I describe the analyzer, its specification, checking and calibration of the gadget together with determination checks in this part of the thesis. Additionally, there is described the principle of the method ELISA- sandwich, which is non-competitive enzymatic immunoanalysis. At the end of the section there is depicted the methodical procedure of my work, the preparation of working solutions and checks, the preparation and dilution of samples for analysis and working procedure for semiquantitative interpretation with positivity index and for quantitative interpretation U/ml. I continued with my own measurements. while respecting standard operations procedures of the laboratory Stafila, a limited liability company. The results of my measurements are processed in the third part of the thesis. The acquired results are given in a table: quantitative interpretation of the antidote against tTg IgA and IgG (U/ml) level in the sera of the osteoporosis diagnosed patients. Then I presented a graph interpreting the proportional relation of the antidote against tTg IgA and IgG levels in the sera of the osteoporosis diagnosed patients. There are included calibration graphs for tissue transglutaminase IgA and IgG and tables of the obtained data of checks for the methods in the results. 3 out of the 58 examined samples of osteoporotic patients were positive, they had the level of antibodies higher than 22 U/ml. One of the samples had marginal figures, which means it had the antidotes against tTg IgA an IgG between 18 and 22 U/ml. Positive results were found with patients born in 1976 and 1978. A patient born in 1962 appeared to have a marginal result. The acquired antidote figures against tissue transglutaminase in the class IgA and IgG are presented proportionally in the graph 1. 3 out of the 58 measured samples were positive, which represents 5 %, and 1 sample was marginal, which is 2 %. My analysis is based on the availability of the examined material and the potential of our laboratory. Celiac disease is an illness which was not paid much attention to in the past. Hypothesis about the link between osteoporosis and celiac disease has been proved...|$|E
