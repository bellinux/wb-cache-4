6000|$|The {{wisdom in}} nature is {{distinguished}} {{from that in}} man by the co-instantaneity of the plan and the execution; the thought and the product are one, or are given at once; {{but there is no}} reflex act, and hence there is no moral responsibility. In man there is reflexion, freedom, and choice; he is, therefore, the head of the visible creation. In the objects of nature are presented, as in a mirror, all the possible elements, steps, and processes of intellect antecedent to consciousness, and therefore to the full development of the intelligential act; and man's mind is the very focus of all the rays of intellect which are scattered throughout the images of nature. Now so to place these images, <b>totalized,</b> and fitted to the limits of the human mind, as to elicit from, and to superinduce upon, the forms themselves the moral reflexions to which they approximate, to make the external internal, the internal external, to make nature thought, and thought nature,--this is the mystery of genius in the Fine Arts. Dare I add that the genius must act on the feeling, that body is but a striving to become mind,--that it is mind in its essence! ...|$|E

5000|$|In music, Orientalism may {{be applied}} to styles {{occurring}} in different periods, such as the alla Turca, used by multiple composers including Mozart and Beethoven. The American musicologist Richard Taruskin has identified in 19th-century Russian music a strain of Orientalism: [...] "the East as a sign or metaphor, as imaginary geography, as historical fiction, as the reduced and <b>totalized</b> other against which we construct our (not less reduced and <b>totalized)</b> sense of ourselves". Taruskin concedes Russian composers, unlike those in France and Germany, felt an [...] "ambivalence" [...] to the theme since [...] "Russia was a contiguous empire in which Europeans, living {{side by side with}} 'orientals', identified (and intermarried) with them far more than in the case of other colonial powers".|$|E
50|$|In 1873 the {{convenience}} of raising the tracks between Plaza del Parque terminus and Once de Septiembre station was already under consideration, due to the vast urbanisation which had taken place along this route making the train’s passage dangerous. The FCO reached Bragado in 1877. On December 20, 1882, the new Once station building was inaugurated. A municipal decree in April 1878 decided to move the terminus to Once de Septiembre but the company delayed its response to the request, despite a concurrent claim from the neighbourhood, until 1 January 1883. By 1879 the railway network <b>totalized</b> 297 km. That same year the net profit was $ 16,788,000. Four years later, the rail network increased to 583 km, with a net profit of $21,583,000; in 1885 the FCO <b>totalized</b> 892 km of tracks.|$|E
