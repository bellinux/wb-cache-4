50|$|<b>Blade</b> <b>shearing</b> as a {{sport has}} been through some ups and downs since the 1980s {{but in the last}} 2 or three years, it has {{increased}} in popularity. In the last 30 years many <b>blade</b> <b>shearing</b> competitions have been discontinued but now, with a resurgence of interest, the number of <b>blade</b> <b>shearing</b> competitions seems to be increasing. There were only 3 <b>blade</b> <b>shearing</b> competitions in Australia 25 years ago but that number has recently increased to at least 14 this year. In the UK this year a show was created specifically for <b>blade</b> <b>shearing</b> and to promote the <b>blade</b> <b>shearing</b> circuit in the UK. This month (October 2016) the Boort show held a <b>blade</b> <b>shearing</b> competition with $3000 for first place, the largest prize for a <b>blade</b> <b>shearing</b> event in the world.The next big <b>blade</b> <b>shearing</b> competition is the world shearing championships in New Zealand, February 2017. Blade shearers from at least 13 countries will be competing including Australia, South Africa, Japan, USA, France, Germany, Ireland, England and more. For the last 20 years, South Africa and Lesotho have dominated the world <b>blade</b> <b>shearing</b> championships.|$|R
50|$|There {{is still}} some <b>blade</b> <b>shearing</b> in South America for Alpaca, Llama and sheep. <b>Blade</b> <b>shearing</b> is used for sheep in parts of Patagonia where the weather can be very harsh and so the extra cover of wool left by <b>blade</b> <b>shears</b> is preferable.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blade</b> <b>shears</b> {{consist of}} two blades {{arranged}} similarly to scissors {{except that the}} hinge {{is at the end}} farthest from the point (not in the middle). The cutting edges pass each other as the shearer squeezes them together and shear the wool close to the animal's skin. <b>Blade</b> <b>shears</b> are still used today but in a more limited way. <b>Blade</b> <b>shears</b> leave some wool on a sheep and this is more suitable for cold climates such as the Canterbury high country in the South Island of New Zealand where approximately half a million sheep are still shorn with <b>blade</b> <b>shears</b> each year. For those areas where no powered-machinery is available <b>blade</b> <b>shears</b> are the only option. Blades are more commonly used to shear stud rams.|$|R
50|$|Most of the <b>blade</b> <b>shearing</b> in Australia is on stud farms, ewes and rams {{in order}} to leave more wool on the sheep or a more natural finish. Some farmers will also trim or shape their sheep using <b>blade</b> <b>shears</b> for showing at competitions.|$|R
50|$|Around 17million of SA 29million sheep {{are still}} blade shorn today. This {{is due to}} the {{relative}} expense of machine <b>shearing</b> compared to <b>blade</b> <b>shearing.</b> <b>Blade</b> <b>shearing</b> is mostly cheaper as a blade shearers equipment in SA is only valued at around R2,000 compared to a shearing machine which costs around R15,000.|$|R

50|$|In the UK {{there is}} still a small number of sheep blade shorn each year. Most of the sheep shorn are in Scotland or in rougher parts of the country where sheep have either been mustered late or they don't have the {{resources}} for machine shearing. Many people still also use <b>blade</b> <b>shears</b> for trimming or dagging their sheep. In saying this {{there are a lot of}} people in the UK who know how to <b>blade</b> <b>shear</b> but most would shear only a few sheep per year.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blade</b> <b>shears</b> {{are similar}} to scissors, {{although}} most have the hinge {{at the back of}} the shears rather than the center but some still have the hinge in the center e.g. Jakoti <b>shears.</b> Conventional <b>blade</b> <b>shears</b> can come with a single bow, double bows or inverse bows. Double bow shears are by far the most common as they are the most versatile. Single bow shears and inverse bowed shears offer more resistance and are mostly only used for tough shearing sheep. They come in varying lengths from about 10 cm(4inches) to 18.5 cm(7.25inches).|$|R

50|$|<b>Blade</b> <b>{{shearing}}</b> or hand shearing is {{the style}} of shearing sheep and other animals with fibrous coats (alpaca, llama, goats etc.) {{with a set of}} specialized scissors. It is practiced {{in many parts of the}} world as both an occupation and a sport. Commercial <b>blade</b> shearers <b>shear</b> on average 140 sheep in an 8-hour working day, but some will shear over 200 sheep in a day.|$|R
50|$|In <b>blade</b> <b>shearing</b> competitions, the {{competitors}} {{are not only}} judged on how fast they can shear but also how tidily they <b>shear.</b> International <b>blade</b> <b>shearing</b> rules stipulate that the sheep must have an even finish of 5-15mm of wool and shearers will be penalised for any skin cuts or any wool that is too short or too long. Shearers are also judged as they shear for any time they cut the wool twice, {{this is called a}} second cut. Shearers can also be penalized for rough handling of the sheep or allowing the sheep to escape their control during shearing.|$|R

5000|$|Most {{commercial}} blade shearers in New Zealand and South Africa use {{a similar}} style of shearing {{to the traditional}} Bowen method (...) used in machine shearing. The main differences are that in <b>blade</b> <b>shearing</b> the shearer takes less wool on {{the first leg of}} the sheep and they shear around the body of the sheep more than along the sheep.|$|R
5000|$|In Okamiden, {{there is}} a demon known as a Gashadokuro which resembles a humongous human {{skeleton}} with a fiery core and <b>twin</b> <b>blades</b> embedded in its stomach. There is also an armoured version {{which is much more}} powerful.|$|R
50|$|When {{a single}} or {{small number of}} sheep need crutching, graziers will often work in the paddock using dagging (or <b>blade)</b> <b>shears</b> or {{portable}} powered shearing gear instead of driving the sheep into the shearing shed and back.|$|R

50|$|<b>Blade</b> <b>shearing</b> has {{recently}} made a resurgence in Australia and the UK but mostly for sport rather than commercial shearing. Some competitions have attracted almost 30 competitors {{and there have}} even been shows created just for blade shearers to compete in.|$|R

25|$|At {{the time}} {{mulesing}} was invented, crutching {{was done with}} <b>blade</b> <b>shears.</b> In Australia, these have been almost universally replaced with machine shears.

5000|$|A {{grapefruit}} knife is {{a special}} type of knife designed specifically for cutting grapefruit. Grapefruit knives are small with a curved serrated blade, designed to hug the curves of the grapefruit. This is used to separate {{the outer edge of}} the segments from the rim of the fruit. The term [...] "grapefruit knife" [...] can refer to a type of knife with short, serrated <b>twin</b> <b>blades</b> about 2mm apart, used to separate the sides of each section from the dividing membrane. Some grapefruit knives incorporate both types, a double-sided curved blade on one side and the parallel <b>twin</b> <b>blades</b> on the other. Another type includes an angled tip and double sided serrated blade. When both types are used, the result is an intact-looking fruit with sections which lift out easily - especially if a [...] "grapefruit spoon" [...] is used.|$|R

50|$|In New Zealand, {{there are}} still {{approximately}} 40 commercial blade shearers who work between July and October each year. Between these shearers, 400,000 sheep are shorn each year in New Zealand, mostly in Otago and the Canterbury high country. Blade shearers in New Zealand usually travel to sheds in groups of 5 or 6 shearers and usually live on the station during shearing. Often they will stay on the station {{for up to a}} week shearing around 1000 sheep per day. Most of the sheep that are blade shorn in New Zealand are fine wooled Merino. The main reason sheep are still blade shorn in New Zealand is due to the harsh climate at the time of <b>shearing.</b> <b>Blade</b> <b>shearing</b> leaves a thicker cover of wool on the sheep after shearing giving it more protection from storms and also the wool grows back faster after <b>blade</b> <b>shearing</b> than machine shearing.|$|R

50|$|Quality control usually {{involves}} taking full cans {{from the line}} - one per seamer head, at least once or twice per shift, and performing a teardown operation (wrinkle/), mechanical tests (external thickness, seamer length/height and countersink) as well as cutting the seam open with a <b>twin</b> <b>blade</b> saw and measuring with a double seam inspection system. The combination of these measurements will determine the seam's quality.|$|R
