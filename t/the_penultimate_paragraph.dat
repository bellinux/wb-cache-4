40|$|A {{uniform and}} {{constructive}} approach for the computation of resolutions and for (co) homology computations for any nite p-group is detailed. The resolutions we construct ([32]) are, as vector spaces, {{as small as}} the minimal resolution of IFp over the elementary abelian p-group of the same order as the group under study. Our implementations {{are based on the}} development of sophisticated algebraic data structures. Applications to calculating functional cocycles are given and the possibility of constructing interesting codes using such methods is presented. 1 Introduction In this paper, we present a uniform constructive approach to calculating relatively small resolutions over nite p-groups. The algorithm we use comes from [32, 8. 1. 8 and <b>the</b> <b>penultimate</b> <b>paragraph</b> of 9. 4]. There has been a massive amount of work done on the structure of p-groups since the beginning of group theory. A good introduction is [22].

40|$|We {{present a}} {{relatively}} simple operator formalism which reproduces the leading infrared logarithm of the one loop quantum gravitational correction to the fermion mode function on a locally de Sitter background. This rule may {{serve as the basis}} for an eventual stochastic formulation of quantum gravity during inflation. Such a formalism would not only effect a vast simplification in obtaining the leading powers of (a) at fixed loop orders, it would also permit us to sum the series of leading logarithms. A potentially important point is that our rule does not seem to be consistent with any simple infrared truncation of the fields. Our analysis also highlights the importance of spin as a gravitational interaction that persists even when kinetic energy has redshifted to zero. Comment: 39 pages, no figuire.

40|$|This bachelor´s thesis {{deals with}} mapping {{technologies}} and base parameters used {{to guarantee the}} quality of systems in the local area networks, including wireless and mobile ones. I have focused mainly on requests and classifications, which are typical for the types of networks on link layer. In Ethernet I focused on the gradual trends in the fore mentioned technologies and IEEE 802. 1 Q and connected IEEE 802. 1 p standards included. The next part describes the quality of systems in wireless nets in different types of environments and again uses given standards for quality of systems guarantee in 802. 11 e and connected 802. 11 a/b/g standards. The next part focuses on the latest generations of mobile nets, looking at the types and trends of the latest technologies. Here I draw from standard project 3 GPP, which describes the problems with these technological developments. The next part focuses on WiMAX technologies. In <b>the</b> <b>penultimate</b> <b>paragraph,</b> the constituent network technologies are compared from the view of securing QoS and I propound possible ways of securing coversion of constituent technologies.
