5|$|During {{the battle}} of Khafji, these {{upgraded}} T-55s survived impacts from MILAN anti-tank missiles. These divisions also had armored personnel vehicles such as the BMP-1, scout vehicles such as the BRDM-2, and several types of artillery.

5|$|In the 1927 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 3 was legislated to {{run along the}} Paterson Plank Road portion of today’s Route 120 {{as part of its}} route between Secaucus and Greenwood Lake. By 1947, Route 3 had been {{designated}} along the entire alignment of current Route 120. When New Jersey renumbered its state highways in 1953, Route 3 was moved to a new freeway alignment that was Route S3. As a result of this realignment, the portion of the route between modern Route 3 and Paterson Plank Road became a portion of Route 20 while the section along Paterson Plank Road was removed from the state highway system. Paterson Plank Road between County Route 503 and Route 17 joined the state highway system again as an extension of <b>this</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> Route 20 in 1972 when the Meadowlands Sports Complex was slated to be built. At this point, Route 20 had consisted of three disconnected segments. Since none of these segments were connected, <b>this</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> road was redesignated Route 120 by the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|On the {{day before}} Reagan's 1987 visit, 50,000 people had {{demonstrated}} against {{the presence of the}} American president in Berlin. During the visit itself, wide swaths of Berlin were closed off to prevent further anti-Reagan protests. The district of Kreuzberg, in particular, was targeted in this respect, with movement throughout <b>this</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the city in effect restrained completely (for instance the subway line 1 was shut down).|$|E
5|$|The {{alignment}} of today’s Route 124 was first {{designated as a}} part of pre-1927 Route 5 in 1916, a route that was to run from Delaware, Warren County to Newark. In 1927, <b>this</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the route became a part of Route 24, a route that was to run from Phillipsburg to Newark. A freeway, which is the current {{alignment of}} Route 24, was proposed for <b>this</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the route in the 1950s that was approved in 1960. Route 24 was moved to the new freeway between the John F. Kennedy Parkway on the Millburn/Summit border and Interstate 78 (I-78) in 1972, with Route 124 being designated along the former alignment of Route 24 east of this point. In 1992, the Route 24 freeway was completed between I-287 in Hanover Township and the John F. Kennedy Parkway. As a result, Route 124 was extended west along the former Route 24 to U.S. Route 202 in Morristown.|$|E

5|$|A {{third part}} of the planet finding mission was the search for Jupiter-mass planets around young stars. The survey would have helped {{scientists}} understand more about solar system formation, including the occurrence of hot Jupiters. <b>This</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the planet hunt was designed to study systems {{with one or more}} Jupiter mass planets before the system has reached long term equilibrium. Planet hunting techniques using a star's radial velocity cannot measure the regular, tiny to-and-fro wobble motions induced by planets against the strong atmospheric activity of a youthful star. It is through the techniques pioneered by Albert A. Michelson that the SIM {{would have been able to}} execute its three primary planet-finding missions.|$|E

5|$|After an {{intersection}} with Schuyler Avenue (which runs as Hudson County Route 507 {{to the south}} of Route 7 and Bergen County Route 130 to the north of Route 7), the road turns NNW, narrowing again to two lanes undivided. In <b>this</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the route, it had a concurrency with County Route 507 (both Bergen and Hudson counties). It keeps this configuration for about a half mile, as it still runs along the Kearny/North Arlington border. At that point, it meets the southern terminus of State Route 17 (Ridge Road) and the northern terminus of Hudson County Route 697 (Kearny Avenue).|$|E
5|$|Although <b>this</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> NY441 is {{surrounded}} by woodlands, it is actually located in a largely developed area of Penfield known locally as Panorama. The woods cease as NY441 approaches an interchange with Panorama Trail (NY153), the lone limited-access junction along the divided highway. East of NY153, NY441 crosses over Irondequoit Creek and downgrades to a four-lane undivided highway at a junction with Penfield Road. Here, Route441 becomes Penfield Road and enters the densely populated hamlet of Penfield.|$|E

5|$|East of Lewiston village, NY104 follows Ridge Road {{through a}} sparsely {{populated}} area of Niagara County. Much of <b>this</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> NY104 is bordered on its southern end by the Tuscarora Indian Reservation. At the Lewiston hamlet of Dickersonville, the extents of the reservation head south, and development along NY104 increases slightly. NY104 meets the northern terminus of NY429 at the Lewiston–Cambria town line and crosses over NY425 at Streeters Corners. Just east of this location is an intersection with NY93 {{in the community of}} Molyneaux Corners. The two routes form a concurrency east to Warrens Corners, a hamlet on the Cambria–Lockport town line, where NY93 turns south to serve the city of Lockport.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{upgrades}} {{were made}} to the portion of U.S. Route 202 concurrent with Route 23. <b>This</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> road, which was originally a four-lane undivided road, saw an upgrade to a six-lane freeway south of the Alps Road interchange and to a six-lane surface road north of there. Construction on these improvements was completed in 1986. There were also plans to replace the Flemington Circle with an interchange as part of a project that would have also built a limited-access bypass of Flemington for Route 31; however, this plan was never realized.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why Burt made such an unusual will, but {{newspaper}} records suggest family feuds were likely {{at the core of}} his decision. The will was challenged by his children after he died. A legal hole was found in 1920 because part of the estate was composed of iron leases in Minnesota, and Minnesota had a law against trusts of such long standing. <b>This</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the estate, amounting to $5 million, was distributed to Burt's children and grandchildren (a son, three daughters and four granddaughters). In 1961, an additional $720,000 was taken from the trust in settlement of a suit filed by nine heirs and the estates of three other descendants.|$|E

Although <b>this</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> NY83 is cosigned with CR85, it is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. An intersection with CR79 is not far off, as it passes {{just north of the}} town of Arkwright.

5|$|New York State Route286 (NY286) is an east–west {{state highway}} in the {{vicinity}} of the city of Rochester, New York, in the United States. It links Rochester to its eastern suburbs and to western Wayne County. The western terminus of the route is at exit7 on NY590 just inside the Rochester city limits. Its eastern terminus is at NY350 in Walworth. NY286 is named Browncroft Boulevard from NY590 to its junction with Qualtrough and Clark roads in Penfield. <b>This</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the highway passes through predominantly residential areas.
