40|$|We {{examine a}} two country aid model with {{performance}} intensive <b>aid.</b> <b>The</b> <b>aid</b> budget {{is determined by}} a donor country legislature, but allocated by a donor agency {{in terms of a}} performance criterion of its choice. Five sources of slippage in policy delivery are introduced: the donor agency observes the performance of <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient imperfectly; <b>the</b> donor agency and <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient are subject to inefficiency; <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient experiences corruption; and adjustment of aid recipient performance is costly. Incentives between <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> donor and <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient are intentionally aligned - to explore the best-case for the policy intervention. Immediate implications are then that optimal level of effort and governance in <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient increase under performance <b>intensity</b> of <b>aid.</b> Moreover, performance <b>intensity</b> of <b>aid</b> has fundraising effects. While <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient also has an incentive to increase the measurement noise in governance, this incentive is weaker than that to raise true underlying governance, is weakest for <b>the</b> poorest <b>aid</b> recipients and provided that the donor agency is sufficiently efficient, measurement error itself will serve to raise optimal effort in <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient. <b>The</b> importance of <b>aid</b> agency self-monitoring is thereby identified.
