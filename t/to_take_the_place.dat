5|$|Culbreth {{became a}} member of the {{official}} AL umpire staff in 1999, when multiple call-up umpires were hired <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of umpires who had participated in a mass resignation. He began his career on the AL staff, but in 2000 MLB merged the umpires from its two leagues. Culbreth wore #42 as an AL umpire, but he had to stop using that number after it was retired in recognition of Jackie Robinson.|$|E
5|$|Imaginos/Desdinova becomes {{from this}} point on an {{instrument}} of Les Invisibles' manipulation of human history. For the next sixty-three years, he insinuates himself into the world of European politics. He uses his ability to change identities <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of high-ranking officials, whose offices he uses to bring about Les Invisibles' will ("I Am the One You Warned Me Of"), introducing new knowledge and technology to the unsuspecting world ("The Siege and Investiture of Baron Von Frankenstein's Castle at Weisseria").|$|E
5|$|Later in Monk's Café, Jerry {{goes back}} on the deal and decides not <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> because George wants it. The two {{continue}} to argue about who should own it, and decided that neither of them should take it. A waitress, Carolyn, played by Anita Wise, overhears them and George offers the place to her, which she accepts. The waitress invites them and Elaine to her housewarming, {{but it is clear}} that Jerry, George, and Elaine are not enjoying themselves. They overhear two people having a conversation about someone else moving out of their apartment, to which all three ask what the apartment's rent is.|$|E

He started the 2015 season {{on the disabled list}} due to a back injury suffered near the end of spring training. At the conclusion of his rehab assignment, he was designated for assignment by the Giants and removed from the 40-man roster. Ishikawa subsequently cleared waivers and was sent to the Sacramento River Cats. On June 24, 2015, Ishikawa was called back up to the Giants <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of the injured Nori Aoki. He was designated for assignment again on July 3.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, both Parker Brothers and Waddington stockpiled {{materials}} they could use for further game production. During the war, Monopoly was produced with wooden tokens in the U.S., and the game's cellophane cover was eliminated. In the UK, metal tokens were also eliminated, and a special spinner was introduced <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of dice. The game remained in print for a time even in the Netherlands, as the printer there was able to maintain a supply of paper. Elizabeth Magie's second patent on The Landlord's Game expired in September, 1941, and {{it is believed that}} after the expiration, she was no longer promoted as an inventor of Monopoly. The game itself remained popular during the war, particularly in camps, and soldiers playing the game became part of the product's advertising in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Fear of {{the loss}} of one's purpose in life is a theme in Vonnegut's works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many people felt when they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut {{witnessed}} machines being built <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of human labor. He confronts these things in his works through references to the growing use of automation and its effects on human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, Player Piano, where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work as machines replace human workers. Loss of purpose is also depicted in Galápagos, where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in Timequake, where an architect kills himself when replaced by computer software.|$|E

5|$|Little Red's {{flights to}} Manchester ended in March 2015 {{with the final}} flights to Edinburgh and Aberdeen departing on 26 September 2015. The planes were {{returned}} for Aer Lingus' sole use in the Republic of Ireland following the final passenger fights of Little Red. After the closure of Little Red, all but three of the Heathrow slots were returned to BA and absorbed back into their operation, thus granting them a monopoly on UK mainland domestic flights at Heathrow {{for the first time}} since British Midland Airways (as BMI were named at the time) moved into Heathrow in 1982. However this was dependent on another airline not being willing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of Little Red in running domestic flights from Heathrow. Virgin leased out the three slots it retained. In 2017, the remaining Little Red slots were taken over by Flybe.|$|E
5|$|Other {{groups also}} {{underwent}} major radiations. Based on molecular sequencing and fossil dating, Neoaves appeared to radiate after the K–Pg boundary. They even produced giant, flightless forms, {{such as the}} herbivorous Gastornis and Dromornithidae, and the predatory Phorusrhacidae. The extinction of Cretaceous lizards and snakes {{may have led to}} the radiation of modern groups such as iguanas, monitor lizards, and boas. On land, giant boid and enormous madtsoiid snakes appeared, and in the seas, giant sea snakes radiated. Teleost fish diversified explosively, filling the niches left vacant by the extinction. Groups appearing in the Paleocene and Eocene include billfish, tunas, eels, and flatfish. Major changes are also seen in Paleogene insect communities. Many groups of ants were present in the Cretaceous, but in the Eocene ants became dominant and diverse, with larger colonies. Butterflies diversified as well, perhaps <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of leaf-eating insects wiped out by the extinction. The advanced mound-building termites, Termitidae, also appear to have risen in importance.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that same}} year, on May 14, 1998, the {{government}} {{signed an agreement}} with Astaldi, regulating construction of the ZagrebGoričan motorway by 2000. On December 11, 1997, pursuant to the agreement, the government established the Autocesta RijekaZagreb company <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of the Autocesta RijekaZagrebGoričan company, and awarded it the 28-year concession to develop, maintain and operate the ZagrebRijeka motorway, effectively excluding the ZagrebGoričan motorway from the original concession. At the same time, the Transeuropska autocesta d.o.o. (TEA) company was established by the government and awarded concession for development, operation and maintenance of the ZagrebGoričan motorway. Astaldi owned 51% of TEA, with the remainder owned by the Republic of Croatia. TEA was to secure financing of the project in 1998. Construction began as scheduled; however, financial and legal problems ensued, and by 1999, the press speculated that Astaldi had given up the project, but Astaldi repeatedly denied these claims. Ultimately, the government cancelled the contract and ceded the motorway to Croatian Roads Administration (ancestor of Hrvatske autoceste and Hrvatske ceste), leading Astaldi to turn to the commercial arbitration court in Vienna, which ruled in its favour. The Republic of Croatia was subsequently required to pay Astaldi 44.3million euro in damages.|$|E

50|$|After the Soviet {{withdrawal}} from Germany {{the army was}} reduced in size to become 8th Guards Army Corps on 1 June 1993, and withdrawn to Volgograd, the former Stalingrad. There it appears <b>to</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of <b>the</b> 34th Army Corps. From June 1993 to February 1995, it was commanded by Lev Rokhlin. 8th Guards Army Corps was disbanded in May 1998.|$|R
5|$|Quwatli {{opposed the}} {{proposed}} partition of the British Mandate of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, {{arguing that the}} plan, which would allocate 56% of Palestine to the Jewish state, violated {{the rights of the}} Palestinian Arab majority. The proposal passed the UN vote and Syria made war preparations soon afterward, including co-founding the Arab Liberation Army (ALA). Quwatli had proposed the creation of the ALA as a volunteer force to attract fighters from throughout the Arab world and <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of Arab regular armies. The ALA's establishment was sponsored by the Arab League following the UN partition vote and Fawzi al-Qawuqji, a Syrian commander who played leading roles in the Great Syrian Revolt and the 1936 revolt in Palestine, was appointed its commander. Quwatli did not believe the armies of Syria and the Arab world were ready to successfully confront Jewish forces and as war drew near in early 1948, he petitioned Abdel Rahman Azzam, head of the Arab League, to not enter Arab armies into Palestine. Instead, Quwatli offered to provide local Palestinian Arab fighters arms and funding. Azzam was not swayed and continued his effort of rallying Arab governments to dispatch their armies. On 15 May, after the establishment of Israel was announced, Quwatli ordered the Syrian Army to enter Palestine immediately.|$|E
