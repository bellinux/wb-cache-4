5|$|Panggilan Darah (Indonesian for Call of Blood) is a 1941 {{film from}} the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) written and {{directed}} by Sutan Usman Karim and produced by Tjho Seng Han for Oriental Film. The black-and-white film starred Dhalia and Soerip as orphaned sisters <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> in the colonial capital of Batavia (now Jakarta) before moving to Kudus to work at a clove cigarette factory.|$|E
5|$|Six of the Pendle witches {{came from}} one of two families, each at the time headed by {{a woman in her}} eighties: Elizabeth Southerns (a.k.a. Demdike), her {{daughter}} Elizabeth Device, and her grandchildren James and Alizon Device; Anne Whittle (a.k.a. Chattox), and her daughter Anne Redferne. The others accused were Jane Bulcock and her son John Bulcock, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, Alice Grey, and Jennet Preston. The outbreaks of witchcraft in and around Pendle may demonstrate the extent to which people could make a living by posing as witches. Many of the allegations resulted from accusations that members of the Demdike and Chattox families made against each other, perhaps because they were in competition, both <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> from healing, begging, and extortion.|$|E

25|$|In Malawi it is {{also common}} {{practice}} to accuse children of witchcraft and many children have been abandoned, abused and even killed as a result. As in other African countries both African traditional healers and their Christian counterparts are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> out of exorcising children and are actively involved in pointing out children as witches. Various secular and Christian organizations are combining their efforts to address this problem.|$|E
500|$|After joining York City in 2009, Lawless {{moved into}} a house with {{teammates}} Neil Barrett, James Meredith, Richard Pacquette and Danny Parslow.

He is a Manchester United supporter and attention to his interest in art was first drawn after producing a painting of manager Alex Ferguson.|$|E
500|$|In April 1933, {{during the}} Great Depression, International President Ida Jackson visited All Saints Industrial School in Lexington, Mississippi. She found {{difficult}} {{conditions in the}} Mississippi Delta. Some of the teachers {{did not have an}} education past the seventh grade. African Americans were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> sharecropping on plantation land as agricultural prices continued to fall. In summer 1934, Ida Jackson initiated the Summer School for Rural Teachers to train future teachers. She worked with a total of 22 student teachers and 243 school children. In addition, she held night classes for 48 adults. By obtaining 2600 books for the school's library, Jackson made it [...] "the largest library owned by white or colored in all Holmes County." ...|$|E

500|$|Cohan viewed Bela as [...] "a {{young woman}} <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> {{and find some}} kind of reason in her world" [...] who was [...] "a little damaged." [...] The actress shared Gamble's opinion of Bela's {{behavior}} being a façade, and incorporated into her performance the idea of Bela hiding her true self, with Cohan feeling that her character created a persona to shield her from [...] "real strong connections". This defensiveness prevented her from opening up to the Winchesters, with whom Cohan believed Bela [...] "would have loved {{to be able to}} have a normal relationship". Contrary to Kripke and Gamble's assessment of Bela as amoral and uncaring, Cohan envisioned the character as having [...] "fits of conscience" [...] offscreen throughout the third season. In the actress's opinion, Bela [...] "would have loved to go around fighting evil with those boys." ...|$|E
500|$|Although she {{has been}} criticised by SNP {{politicians}} for taking a [...] "Blairite" [...] stance on public services, The Guardians Peter Hetherington has described Lamont as [...] "rooted to older [...] party values, with a deep commitment to fairness". Her politics were heavily influenced by her inner city upbringing and her career in teaching. Her childhood experience was something she addressed in an emotional speech to delegates at the 2013 Scottish Labour Party Conference: [...] "I saw in my upbringing the beauty of our land and felt both the warmth of community and the harshness and brutality at times of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> here. I had the privilege {{to grow up in}} a family of love, but one where my mother always reminded me that what we ate, what we wore, where we lived, was all the product of the sweat of my father's brow earned at sea. And I respected that." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{allegations}} made in the Pendle witch trials resulted {{from members of the}} Demdike and Chattox families making accusations against each other. Historian John Swain has said that the outbreaks of witchcraft in and around Pendle demonstrate the extent to which people could make a living either by posing as a witch, or by accusing or threatening to accuse others of being a witch. Although it is implicit in much of the literature on witchcraft that the accused were victims, often mentally or physically abnormal, for some at least, {{it may have been a}} trade like any other, albeit one with significant risks. There may have been bad blood between the Demdike and Chattox families because they were in competition with each other, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> from healing, begging, and extortion. The Demdikes are believed to have lived close to Newchurch in Pendle, and the Chattox family about [...] away, near the village of Fence.|$|E

He lives a poor life going {{from town to town}} with little money, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> off his show with a puppet. By being an {{adolescent}} or young adult, Yukito sometimes acts childishly if provoked. Yukito tends to be helpful to those around him while trying to earn any money at the same time, and does his best to look after Misuzu in the Dream arc. Misuzu Kamio, the main heroine of Air, makes Yukito quite mistrustful at first by being too friendly, but eventually earns his affection. She is a cheerful but introverted, slightly clumsy and simplistic high school girl, and often utters the pseudo-dinosauric phrase gao when she feels troubled, a habit she retained from childhood. Misuzu has a great love of dinosaurs, finding the story of their glory and extinction [...] "romantic". As a child, her fascination with dinosaurs stemmed from thinking chicks would grow into them; her adoptive mother Haruko Kamio thinks it is ridiculous.|$|E
2500|$|However, the 2003 {{season was}} also spotted with {{controversy}} involving Singh surrounding the year's {{event at the}} Bank of America Colonial. LPGA star Annika Sörenstam {{became the first woman}} to play at a PGA Tour event since Babe Zaharias at the 1945 Los Angeles Open. Surrounding this fervor, Singh was misquoted as having said that Sörenstam [...] "didn't belong" [...] on the men's tour and that he would not play if he were paired with her. What he actually said is {{that he would not be}} paired with her because his playing partner was being selected from the past champion's pool. Singh later clarified, [...] "There are guys out there <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living.</b> It's not a ladies' tour. If she wants to play, she should—or any other woman for that matter—if they want to play the man's tour, they should qualify and play like everybody else." ...|$|E
2500|$|If it weren’t for {{the fact}} that I {{actually}} enjoy conversing with the fans of my prior bands, I would never have found out about a new band called Screeching Weasel beginning to tour. “This can’t be the band I was in.” I say to myself. “I would have been preparing.” [...] My mind would much prefer going to a place of calm contemplation than into a dark cold room filled with anger and the emotions associated with betrayal. So to avoid painful emoting I first took the facts that Ben and I started a band together called Screeching Weasel, we both spent all our days making that band a home for ourselves, and 18 years later we put it to rest. This along with the statement made by both me and Ben on many occasions that the band wouldn’t be Screeching Weasel without either of us, makes me assume that this band playing isn’t Screeching Weasel, because I don’t recall having kicked myself out of the band. So it seems logical that this is not Screeching Weasel. If it were I would have to admit that I longer [...] have friends named Ben Foster or Dan Schafer. As for people like Ben Weasel, Dan Vapid, or even John Jughead, I have nothing to say, because they never really existed, they were just made up names for a bunch of friends that tried to do something different in order to survive and make a living in this world. And I imagine they are all still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> somehow, seeing that their band’s prominent “leader” never wanted to tour {{in order to make it}} financially viable to continue on.|$|E

60|$|I came East in January, 1867. Orion {{remained}} in Carson City perhaps a year longer. Then {{he sold his}} twelve-thousand-dollar house and its furniture for thirty-five hundred in greenbacks at about sixty per cent. discount. He and his wife took passage in the steamer for home in Keokuk. About 1871 or '72 they came to New York. Orion had been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> in the law ever since he had arrived from the Pacific Coast, but he had secured only two cases. Those he was to try free of charge--but the possible result will never be known, because the parties settled the cases out of court without his help.|$|E
60|$|One soft noon in {{the middle}} of August the farmer came in from the corn-field that an early frost had blighted, and told his wife that they must give it up.

The oats had hardly been worth cutting, and now the corn was gone, and there was not hay enough without it to winter the stock; if they got through themselves they would have to live on potatoes. Have a vendue, and sell out everything before the snow flew, and let the State take the farm and get what it could for it, and turn over the balance that was left after the taxes; the interest of the savings-bank mortgage would soon eat that up.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was all so}} exquisitely graceful {{that one}} forgot how wickedly {{dangerous}} it was; but I think that the brief English colloquy was the great wonder of the event for me, and I doubt if I could ever have been perfectly happy again, if chance had not amiably suffered me to satisfy my curiosity concerning the speakers. A few evenings after that, I was at that copy of {{a copy of a}} tournament, and, a few gradines below me, I saw the man of the Prince Albert coat and the derby hat. I had already made up my mind that he was an American, for I supposed that an Englishman would rather perish than wear such a coat with such a hat, and as I had wished all my life to speak to a circus-man, I went down and boldly accosted him. [...] "Are you a brother Yankee?" [...] I asked, and he laughed, and confessed that he was an Englishman, but he said he was glad to meet any one who spoke English, and he made a place for me by his side. He was very willing to tell how he happened to be there, and he explained that he was the manager of a circus, which had been playing to very good business all winter in Spain. In an evil hour he decided to come to Italy, but he found the prices so ruinously low that he was forced to disband his company. This diving girl was all that remained to him of its many attractions, and he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> for both {{in a country where the}} admission to a circus was six of our cents, with fifty for a reserved seat. But he was about to give it up and come to America, where he said Barnum had offered him an engagement. I hope he found it profitable, and is long since an American citizen, with as good right as any of us to wear a Prince Albert coat with a derby hat.|$|E
