5|$|David Kaczynski {{had once}} admired and {{emulated}} his older brother, but had later {{decided to leave}} the survivalist lifestyle behind. He had received assurances from the FBI that he would remain anonymous and that his brother would not learn who had turned him in, but his identity was leaked to CBS News in early April 1996. CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director Louis Freeh, who requested 24 hours before CBS broke the story on the evening news. The FBI scrambled to finish <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, an internal leak investigation was conducted by the FBI, but the source of the leak was never identified. In 1996 the Evergreen Park Community High School was also placed on lockdown while FBI agents searched Kaczynski's school records. At the end of that school day, students were greeted by reporters asking how they felt about going to the same high school the Unabomber had attended. That night the news story was released to public.|$|E
25|$|Against <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrant,</b> the Chamber of Deputies walked appeal under Article 68 of the Constitution, {{which prohibits}} the {{violation}} of premises available to parliamentarians without consent of Parliament but Davide Caparini was condemned in 2004 by the Constitutional Court with a sentence of 6 months and 20 days.|$|E
25|$|Project Halo, {{a three-year}} {{investigation}} by the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Team of the RCMP, into alleged criminal activity with the Nanaimo chapter. The investigation culminated in <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> being executed on December 12, 2003. On November 9, 2007 a seizure order was executed, under section 467.12(1) of the Criminal Code, on the clubhouse by dozens of heavily armed RCMP officers.|$|E
25|$|Also {{named in}} <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> were VECO {{officers}} Bill J. Allen, Rick Smith and Pete Leathard.|$|R
50|$|The {{application}} for the setting aside of <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> and <b>the</b> seizure of articles was therefore dismissed.|$|R
50|$|While it was {{not listed}} in <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrant's</b> findings, a {{cigarette}} butt {{was reported to have}} been removed from the car separately, and taken directly to a crime lab.|$|R
25|$|Lazarus {{appealed the}} conviction, {{claiming}} that {{the age of the}} case and the evidence denied her due process. She also alleged that <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> was improperly granted, her statements in an interview prior to her arrest were compelled, and that evidence supporting the original case theory should have been admitted at trial. In 2015, the verdict was upheld by the California Court of Appeal.|$|E
25|$|A {{few weeks}} after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States, {{mistakes}} led ASIO to incorrectly raid the home of Bilal Daye and his wife. It has been revealed that <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> was for a different address. The couple subsequently sought damages and the embarrassing incident was settled out of court in late 2005, with all material relating to the case being declared strictly confidential.|$|E
25|$|On August 28, 2013, Lee Seok-ki {{allegedly}} took a {{taxi and}} ran away in disguise when he found the investigators searching and seizing his place, {{according to the report}} of Channel A, a South Korean TV network. On the next day Lee explained he stayed in Seoul. Owing to his running away the execution of <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> on his body had to be delayed until the next day.|$|E
50|$|On 19 February 2014, a New Zealand {{appeals court}} {{overruled}} the 28 June 2012 decision, declaring <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> against Kim Dotcom to be valid. Dotcom's extradition hearing is currently set for July 2014.|$|R
50|$|On April 3, 2006, a Justice of the British Columbia Supreme Court {{ordered the}} further release of various {{documents}} used by police to obtain <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> served on individuals {{linked to the}} Raids.|$|R

25|$|The {{court ordered}} the records {{unsealed}} in July 2014. The media organizations {{were able to}} review and report on <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> applications and the investigative notes that had supported them, with most names redacted, for not only the residences and cars but Hedgepeth's phone, computer, Facebook records and bank account. Also released was the transcript of Rosario's 9-1-1 call, {{and the content of}} the early-morning text messages as well as the timeline of Rosario and Hedgepeth's actions the night before the body was found.|$|E
25|$|On December 5, 2008, the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal {{held that}} her {{statements}} {{were taken in}} violation of her Miranda rights, but that the search of her car was still valid under the inevitable discovery exception to <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> requirement because the police would have inevitably {{found it in the}} normal course of the investigation despite her illegal statement. The case was sent back for trial. A pre-trial status hearing was scheduled for June 22, 2009. On April 1, 2009, the judge ordered Nowak to undergo two psychiatric evaluations before June 12, 2009.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of Bryson's escape, Berdella was arrested on charges pertaining to the sexual assault of Christopher Bryson. He declined to allow officers inside his home, and <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> earlier requested was drafted to search his property. Corroborating Bryson's claims to have been restrained and tortured in a second floor bedroom, investigators discovered the bedroom {{on the second floor}} was found to have burnt ropes attached to the posts {{at the foot of the}} bed. Also in the room was an electrical transformer, plugged into a wall, and with wires leading to the bed. A metal tray containing syringes, small bottles apparently containing prescription drugs, swabs, and eye drops was also close to the bed. Also found in the room were a long iron pipe, various lengths of rope, and leather belts. Investigators also noted that although Bryson's restraints had been tied to posts at each corner of the bed, other posts on the bed had been extensively worn, suggesting that restraints had earlier been tied to these posts, and that the individual or individuals had struggled to free themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Littlejohn's defense {{attorney}} Joyce David challenged the autopsy findings {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> giving police <b>the</b> authority to <b>search</b> Littlejohn's van, his apartment, and to investigate his cell phone records. [...] Prosecutors were given permission by Justice Abraham Gerges to admit evidence from Littlejohn's other crimes.|$|R
25|$|Defense lawyers filed {{unsuccessful}} appeals that {{challenged the}} conduct of the grand jury, the contempt fines, the execution of <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrants,</b> and various trial procedures. At least ten appeals were heard by the United States Court of Appeals, and three were heard by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|R
5000|$|On 28 June 2012, New Zealand High Court judge Justice Helen Winkelmann {{ruled that}} <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>{{warrants}}</b> used to raid {{the home of}} Kim Dotcom were invalid, saying [...] "The warrants did not adequately describe the offences to which they related. They were general warrants, and as such, are invalid." ...|$|R
25|$|In May 1735, Vicente died, {{filling the}} former {{privateer}} with guilt. Attempting {{to escape the}} administration of Abadía, Enríquez took refuge in the Convent of Santo Tomás on October 30, 1735. He remained there after hearing rumors {{that he was going}} to be jailed at El Morro. However, even there the governor pursued him. Abadía requested permission to obtain a search warrant and check if Enríquez had taken any wealth there. All of the rooms were rummaged, but nothing of worth was found. Despite this, Abadía confiscated Enríquez's correspondence. Incredulous, the former privateer requested a certification for <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrant.</b> Between 1735 and 1737, Enríquez wrote to Phillip V six times requesting an independent prosecutor that could launch a neutral investigation. He also offered to reorganize the now scattered privateers. However, the king never replied directly and the only response, issued by the Council of the Indies, informed him that they did not consider that action convenient. From that moment onwards, Enríquez only wrote to detail his misery and to request the payment of an old debt. During the following years, his only contact to the outside world was through the Dominican friars. To Enríquez's chagrin, Abadía had unusual longevity in the office of governor, with the Crown granting him time beyond the stipulated five years. In 1740, the Council of the Indies revised Mendizábal's case and issued a declaration restoring his honor and rank. However, they never did the same for Enríquez despite being charged as a supposed accomplice of the former governor. Most of his friend eventually left, only Paris and the members of the Church remained besides him. On June 29, 1743, Abadía died while still in office. Five months afterwards, Enríquez died a sudden death. After receiving the Extreme Unction, his body was laid to rest in a mass grave as a charity, since he was penniless and nobody paid for a burial. Only Paris and Rosa Enríquez, his unrecognized daughter who would later claim that he had been poisoned, mourned his death.|$|E
500|$|Paragraphs 204 and 205 of the FBI {{search and}} arrest warrant for Ted Kaczynski stated that [...] "experts"—many of them {{academics}} consulted by the FBI—believed the manifesto {{had been written}} by [...] "another individual, not Theodore Kaczynski". As stated in the affidavit, {{only a handful of}} people believed Kaczynski was the Unabomber before <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> revealed the abundance of evidence in Kaczynski's isolated cabin. <b>The</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> affidavit written by FBI Inspector Terry D. Turchie reflects this conflict, and is striking evidence of the opposition to Turchie and his small cadre of FBI agents that included Moss and Puckett—who were convinced Kaczynski was the Unabomber—from the rest of the UNABOM Task Force and the FBI in general: ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2010, Poole gave {{evidence}} in the trial United States of America v. David Kernell as a government witness. As a witness, he explained the terminology used on 4chan to the prosecutor, ranging from [...] "OP" [...] to [...] "lurker". He also explained to the court {{the nature of the}} data given to the FBI as part of <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrant,</b> including how users can be uniquely identified from site audit logs.|$|E
50|$|The {{case had}} begun in 1957, when the Kansas City Police Department vice squad raided the {{warehouse}} of a local news distributor and five newsstands. Officers seized dozens of publications, far beyond those which had started the investigation, since <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> were not specific. Less {{than half of the}} seized titles were ultimately found obscene and ordered to be burnt.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, {{while still}} in prison, Feigley was convicted of instructing his wife and another man over a prison phone {{to have sex with}} a 14-year-old girl. Feigley was found guilty of {{conspiracy}} to commit involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and sentenced. Because of problems with <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrants,</b> Feigley's wife and the girl's mother were able to plead guilty and receive probation.|$|R
50|$|In October 1986, {{hundreds}} {{of federal and}} state law enforcement conducted a coordinated raid on the offices of LaRouche enterprises, including those of the FEF, and seized the documents that had been subpoenaed in 1985. The FEF and other entities argued in court that <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> had been improperly executed, and that documents were taken in violation of their Fourth Amendment rights. The Court of Appeals denied their appeal.|$|R
500|$|During the interrogation, Calvo {{repeatedly}} {{requested to}} see <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrant,</b> but his lawyer stated no copy was provided until three days later. A County Police spokesman initially stated that a no-knock warrant had been issued for Calvo's home. However, after Calvo's lawyer challenged that statement and media published {{copies of the}} warrant, {{the commander of the}} county's narcotics enforcement division stated that no-knock warrants do not exist in the county. [...] However, no-knock warrants were clarified in a 2005 law, sponsored by Baltimore Delegate Curt Anderson, that limits their use to suspects fleeing into a house, or if a suspect is considered armed or is attempting to destroy evidence.|$|E
2500|$|An {{occupant}} {{of the house}} told Radio New Zealand that some {{people who had been}} in the house had likely met Tame Iti, but that <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> was for firearms and other materials, including things like [...] "green jacket" [...] and [...] "men's black shoes." [...] Police took away documents and bags of clothing.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> {{affidavit}} {{states that}} the Mohave County District Attorney sought records relating to personal charges on an agency credit card from the Colorado City Fire Department under the open records laws. Chief Barlow indicated {{that there were no}} personal charges, therefore there were no records to disclose. [...] Records obtained by subpoena from the banks involved showed a series of purchases made by Chief Barlow and Darger that are questionable, including diapers, child's clothing, and food, although the firefighters are not fed by the department. No charges have yet been brought.|$|E

25|$|The abuse hotline {{calls that}} {{prompted}} the raid are now {{believed to have been}} made by Rozita Swinton, a non-FLDS woman with no known connection to the FLDS community in Texas.

500|$|Defense lawyers filed {{numerous}} unsuccessful appeals that {{challenged the}} conduct of the grand jury, the contempt fines, the execution of <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> and various trial procedures. At least ten appeals were heard by the United States court of appeals, and three were appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

2500|$|A {{grand jury}} for the Eastern District of California indicted Grubbs on {{one count of}} [...] "receiving a visual {{depiction}} of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct." [...] Grubbs' defense counsel, Mark Reichel moved to suppress the evidence seized during the search of his residence, arguing in part that the warrant was invalid because it failed to list the triggering condition and that the 4th Amendment requires officers to provide a copy of <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> to the homeowner when conducting a search. After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied the motion. Grubbs pleaded guilty, but reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.|$|E
2500|$|In this case, {{there was}} ample {{evidence}} {{upon which the}} jury could properly base their finding of aggravated damages. The existence of the file on Casey Hill under the designation [...] "Enemy Canada" [...] was evidence of the malicious intention of Scientology to [...] "neutralize" [...] him. The press conference was organized {{in such a manner}} as to ensure the widest possible dissemination of the libel. Scientology continued with the contempt proceedings although it knew its allegations were false. In its motion to remove Hill from <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> proceedings, it implied that he was not trustworthy and might act in those proceedings in a manner that would benefit him in his libel action. It pleaded justification or truth of its statement when it knew it to be false. It subjected Hill to a demeaning cross-examination and, in its address to the jury, depicted Hill as a manipulative actor.|$|E
2500|$|The defendant, Jeffrey Grubbs, {{became the}} subject of an {{undercover}} federal investigation and prosecution when he ordered a videotape containing child pornography from a website operated by an undercover U.S. postal inspector. The Postal Inspection Service then arranged a controlled delivery of the tape to Grubbs. An application was submitted to a magistrate judge for the Eastern District of California requesting an [...] "anticipatory" [...] search warrant, so-called because it is based upon the probable cause that at some time in the future (but not at present) certain evidence of a crime will be located at a specified place). An affidavit accompanying the warrant application stated as the [...] "triggering condition" [...] that <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> would not be executed until the tape had been delivered and taken into Grubbs' home. However, this condition was omitted from the issued warrant. Two days later, the undercover delivery occurred and Grubbs' house was searched after the tape was taken inside. The videotape and other items were seized, and Grubbs was arrested.|$|E
50|$|Dupnik {{received}} worldwide criticism {{over his}} defense of the botched SWAT team raid of Jose Guerena that left the former Marine dead. Dupnik openly stated that the raid was justified and told Arizona Daily Star columnist Josh Brodesky that he may never release <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> and police affidavits. Dupnik defended the police who left Guerena, after being shot 22 times, inside his house while paramedics were prevented from entering for over an hour.|$|R
