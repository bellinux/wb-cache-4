5|$|A {{group of}} six Serbian nationalists, among them Boško Radonjić, placed a home-made bomb {{in the home of}} the Yugoslav {{consulate}} in Chicago in 1975. Radonjić later became the leader of the Westies gang in New York City, where he participated in organized crime and racketeering. He eventually became one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>feared</b> gangsters in the New York City underworld, and developed extensive friendships with Vojislav Stanimirović, John Gotti and the Gambino family. After Sammy Gravano turned John Gotti in to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in December 1990, Radonjić was highly suspected to have attempted to fix the trial on John Gotti's behalf. As a result of this, Radonjić was arrested on December 1999 during a spectacular rerouted plane going to Cuba to a lockdown at Miami International Airport when he was tracked down by the FBI. He was arrested in the United States again in January 2000 for further investigation of the 1992 Gotti trial. Upon release in 2001, he left the United States and moved back to Serbia where he lived until his death in 2011. He was also an admirer and long-time friend of Radovan Karadžić until the latter went into hiding in 1996.|$|E
5|$|In late 1863, while Quantrill's Raiders {{spent the}} winter in Texas, {{animosity}} developed between Anderson and Quantrill. Anderson, perhaps falsely, implicated Quantrill in a murder, leading to the latter's arrest by Confederate authorities. Anderson subsequently returned to Missouri {{as the leader of}} a group of raiders and became <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>feared</b> guerrilla in the state, killing and robbing dozens of Union soldiers and civilian sympathizers throughout central Missouri. Although Union supporters viewed him as incorrigibly evil, Confederate sympathizers in Missouri saw his actions as justified, possibly owing to their mistreatment by Union forces. In September 1864 he led a raid on Centralia, Missouri. Unexpectedly, they were able to capture a passenger train, the first time Confederate guerrillas had done so. In {{what became known as the}} Centralia Massacre--possibly the war's deadliest and most brutal guerrilla action--his men killed 24 Union soldiers on the train and set an ambush later that day that killed more than 100 Union militiamen. A month later Anderson himself was killed in battle. Historians have made disparate appraisals of Anderson: some see him as a sadistic, psychopathic killer, but for others his actions cannot be separated from the general lawlessness of the time.|$|E
5|$|A right-arm fast bowler of express pace, Lindwall {{was widely}} {{regarded}} as the greatest pace bowler of his era and one of the finest of all time. Together with Keith Miller, Lindwall formed a new-ball pairing {{regarded as one of the}} greatest to have played cricket. Lindwall was known for his classical style, with a smooth and rhythmic run-up and textbook side-on bowling action, from which he generated his trademark outswinger which moved away late at high pace. Lindwall mixed his outswinger with a searing yorker, subtle changes of pace and an intimidating bouncer that skidded at the heads of opposing batsmen. Later in his career, Lindwall developed an inswinger, which together with his variety, pace and control made him <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>feared</b> paceman of his time. Lindwall was a fine all round cricketer; he was a hard-hitting batsman who scored two centuries at Test level and often improved Australia's position with his lower order batting. Lindwall's best known performance was his role in leading the Australian bowling during the 1948 tour of England under Don Bradman; the 1948 Australian team went through the tour undefeated and gained the sobriquet The Invincibles which saw it regarded as one of the finest teams in cricketing history. Lindwall's place in Australian cricket history saw him inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 as one of the ten inaugural members. In 2000, Lindwall was named in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the association between well-known diseases and fear of them in individuals over 50 years of age. Information on the fear of diseases can be relevant for both public health information purposes and clinical setting diagnostics. However, very few studies have investigated the fear of diseases in individuals over the age of 50. We used an electronic survey method and asked individuals older than 50 to report their fear of eight different diseases. Fear of diseases was the outcome measure. A 10 -point Likert scale questionnaire was used to assess the fear of contracting different diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular disease, HIV, depression, diabetes, skin disorders (eczema and psoriasis), and chronic pain. There were 376 respondents. Cancer and Alzheimer’s disease were associated with <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>fear.</b> Fear of these two diseases was significantly higher than for other diseases (p =  0. 01). Age had no significant impact on the fear of diseases (p =  0. 68). Of the 376 respondents, 39 % reported a strong fear (10 points) of Alzheimer’s disease, whereas 30 % reported a strong fear of cancer. Only 2 % reported a strong fear of cardiovascular disease. This study suggests that cancer and Alzheimer’s disease evoke <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>fear...</b>|$|R

25|$|Smallpox is an {{infectious}} disease caused by two strains of virus, Variola major and V. minor. V. minor is the rarer {{of the two}} strains, and causes a much less severe disease (sometimes called alastrim), with a fatality rate of around 1%. No treatment is available, and the only protection is vaccination. The virus is usually transmitted by prolonged face-to-face contact with a person showing symptoms. The incubation period averages 12–14 days. One of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>feared</b> diseases of human history, smallpox was still causing an estimated 2 million deaths every year as late as 1967.|$|E
