5|$|Capillaries are {{organized}} into capillary beds in tissues; {{it is here}} that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b> Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b> Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.|$|E
5|$|Heart tissue, {{like all}} {{cells in the}} body, needs to be {{supplied}} with oxygen, nutrients {{and a way of}} removing metabolic wastes. This is achieved by the coronary circulation, which includes arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. Blood flow through the coronary vessels occurs in peaks and troughs relating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> muscle's relaxation or contraction.|$|E

Pope Leo XIII gave Jean Eudes the title of [...] "Author of the Liturgical Worship of <b>the</b> Sacred <b>Heart</b> of Jesus and Holy Heart of Mary" [...] and both popes Leo XIII and Pius X called Eudes the [...] "father, teacher and first apostle" [...] of devotions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hearts</b> of Jesus and Mary.|$|R

5|$|Adult {{amphibians}} {{and most}} reptiles {{have a double}} circulatory system, meaning a circulatory system divided into arterial and venous parts. However, the heart itself is not completely separated into two sides. Instead, it is separated into three chambers – two atria and one ventricle. Blood returning from both the systemic circulation and the lungs is returned, and blood is pumped simultaneously into the systemic circulation and the lungs. The double system allows blood to circulate to and from lungs which deliver oxygenated blood directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bats seem to {{make use}} of {{particularly}} strong venomotion, a rhythmic contraction of venous wall muscles. In most mammals, the walls of the veins provide mainly passive resistance, maintaining their shape as deoxygenated blood flows through them, but in bats they appear to actively support blood flow back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> with this pumping action. Due to their relatively small and lightweight bodies, bats are not at risk of blood flow rushing to their heads when roosting.|$|E

Since Germanicus had left the Rhine in AD 16, the German tribes that formerly fought alongside each other against the Romans had turned on each other. The two major forces in the region, the Marcomanni under king Maroboduus and the Cherusci under Arminius clashed and, after an indecisive battle, Maroboduus withdrew <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> of his kingdom in the forests of Bohemia.

5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is {{anterograde}} (going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart),</b> and from superficial to deep veins via perforator veins. However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain the abdominal wall and have a flow {{from top to bottom}} so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from the sole of the foot venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous arch of the foot, going therefore against the norm, from deep to superficial veins.|$|E

5|$|Risk factors {{indicating}} {{an increased}} risk of death include older age, female gender, a history of liver cirrhosis, biliary narrowing due to cancer, acute renal failure and the presence of liver abscesses. Complications following severe cholangitis include renal failure, respiratory failure (inability of the respiratory system to oxygenate blood and/or eliminate carbon dioxide), cardiac arrhythmia, wound infection, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding and myocardial ischemia (lack of blood flow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> leading to heart attacks).|$|E
5|$|The cardiac {{skeleton}} is made {{of dense}} connective tissue and this gives structure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b> It forms the atrioventricular septum which separates the atria from the ventricles, and the fibrous rings which serve as bases for the four heart valves. The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart's electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity. The interatrial septum separates the atria and the interventricular septum separates the ventricles. The interventricular septum is much thicker than the interatrial septum, since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract.|$|E
5|$|The heart {{functions}} as a pump in the circulatory system to provide a continuous flow of blood throughout the body. This circulation consists of the systemic circulation {{to and from the}} body and the pulmonary circulation to and from the lungs. Blood in the pulmonary circulation exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen in the lungs through the process of respiration. The systemic circulation then transports oxygen to the body and returns carbon dioxide and relatively deoxygenated blood <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> for transfer to the lungs.|$|E

5|$|The left {{ventricle}} is much thicker {{as compared with}} the right, due to the greater force needed to pump blood to the entire body.

Two small openings above the aortic valve carry blood <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> itself, the left main coronary artery and the right coronary artery.|$|E

5000|$|Cardiology/Regeneration - Researchers, {{including}} Drs.
