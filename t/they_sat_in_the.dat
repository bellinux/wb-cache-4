5|$|The first {{large-scale}} organized sit-in was on Saturday, February 13, 1960. At about 12:30 pm, 124 students, {{most of them}} black, {{walked into}} the downtown Woolworths, S. H. Kress, and McClellan stores and asked to be served at the lunch counters. After the staff refused to serve them, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stores for two hours and then left without incident.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions {{encouraged}} its 800,000 {{members to}} not fly with Braathens {{due to the}} introduction of a segregated classes. SAS did not follow the same policy, and offered its discounted customers to travel in the same class as Braathens', including complimentary service. After introduction, the concept increased the work load on handing employees, who needed to check the passengers' tickets to ensure <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right class. There were also complaints from Best-passengers who felt that they were receiving worse service after the scheme was introduced.|$|E
25|$|According to Ağca, {{the plan}} was for him and the back-up gunman Oral Çelik to open fire in St. Peter's Square and escape to the Bulgarian embassy {{under the cover of}} the panic {{generated}} by a small explosion. On 13 May <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> square, writing postcards and waiting for the Pope to arrive. When the Pope passed them, Ağca fired several shots and wounded him, but was grabbed by spectators and Vatican security chief Camillo Cibin and prevented from finishing the assassination or escaping. Four bullets hit John Paul II, two of them lodging in his lower intestine, the others hitting his left hand and right arm. Two bystanders were also hit. Çelik panicked and fled without setting off his bomb or opening fire. The Pope survived the assassination attempt.|$|E

50|$|From May 22-24, 350 UFT members {{stayed out}} of school in protest. On June 20, these 350 strikers were also {{dismissed}} by the governing board.

50|$|According to some accounts, Spaggiari {{brought his}} men a meal {{including}} wine and pâté, and reportedly <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vault {{for a picnic}} lunch, after welding the vault door shut from the inside. The gang spent hours picking through the various safe deposit boxes. Before they left on July 20, they left this message {{on the walls of}} the vault: sans armes, ni haine, ni violence ("without weapons, nor hatred, nor violence"). This was Spaggiari's message to the world, implying that he considered himself to be something more than a common thief.|$|R
25|$|On 13 May, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> square, writing postcards {{waiting for}} the Pope to arrive. When the Pope passed through an adoring and excited crowd of supporters, Ağca fired four shots at 17:17 with a 9mm Browning Hi-Power {{semi-automatic}} pistol, and critically wounded him. He fled the scene as the crowd was in shock and disposed of the pistol by throwing it under a truck, but was grabbed by Vatican security chief Camillo Cibin, a nun, and several spectators who prevented him from firing more shots or escaping, and he was arrested. All four bullets hit John Paul II; two of them lodged in his lower intestine while the other two hit his left index finger and right arm and also injured two bystanders: Ann Odre, of Buffalo, New York, was struck in the chest, and Rose Hall was slightly wounded in the arm. The Pope was immediately {{rushed to the hospital}} while the authorities combed the site for evidence. Çelik panicked and fled without setting off his bomb or opening fire.|$|E
500|$|Anderson {{informed}} the journalist Margot Adler {{that when he}} was nine years old he encountered a small old woman sitting in the centre of a circle containing brass bowls of herbs. He alleged that he instinctively stripped naked and that she then sexually initiated him into a witchcraft tradition, during which he had a vision of a goddess and a horned god. After the vision, he claimed that <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circle and she instructed him in the magical use of the various herbs, after which he was washed in butter, oil, and salt, before putting his clothes on and returning home. The Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White described this as being [...] "difficult to accept as a literal account", but suggested that Anderson may have undergone a significant spiritual experience with an older woman in 1926, which was subsequently [...] "embellished into the later tale" [...] that he told Adler. A woman who knew Anderson, Cornelia Benavidez, later stated that [...] "He says that he became friends with a woman in the circus who was a fire dancer and when she got older worked the stands. She somehow joined the circus in South Africa and {{made her way to the}} US. When he first met her she was 60 years old and he was a nine-year-old boy. He knew her for 15 years". Researcher WIlliam Wallworth provided potential supporting evidence for this claim when he noted that a number of the circuses that performed in Oregon during the 1920s and 1930s had Africans in their travelling retinues.|$|E
2500|$|In 1933, {{advertising}} executive Milton H. Biow, {{the principal of}} the Biow Agency in New York City, was managing the advertising account of Philip Morris cigarettes. Biow had an idea to bring new life (literally) to the mature [...] "bellboy with tray of cigarettes" [...] campaign. He had heard of the distinctive voice and appearance of Roventini. Biow and Philip Morris executive Alfred E. Lyons went to the hotel where Johnny worked. <b>They</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lobby and observed him, noting both his diminutive size and distinctive voice.|$|E
25|$|There were 54 {{passengers}} on board, 43 {{of whom were}} killed. The other 11 suffered serious injuries; <b>they</b> had mostly <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forward section of the aircraft. Apart from one girl from the United States, all were from Afghanistan, Pakistan and India (especially the Punjab region). There {{was a mixture of}} British residents returning after visiting their families and new immigrants.|$|R
25|$|In Manchester, 300 (eye-witness Stop the War estimate) {{secondary}} school children, Further Education students and university students met at Albert Square at 12 noon. They {{marched to the}} BBC studios where <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> road at around 1pm and blocked the traffic {{for over an hour}} where their numbers grew to around 1000 demonstrators. They were filmed by anti-war activists and video clips were distributed. The students then marched around the city centre and ended up back at Albert Square at about 4pm where they remained demonstrating <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> Town Hall for some hours. The whole of this event was filmed by anti-war activists accumulating two hours of footage.|$|R
50|$|Also, a {{new type}} of contestants was introduced, the {{suffering}} contestants. They were a couple, just like the others, but with a very different purpose. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first episodes <b>they</b> were <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public's front row and in later episodes they were locked in a separated room decorated like a dungeon, and there they would watch the auction from a screen, while the secretaries gave them information written in signboards about where the best prizes were hiding (sometimes, subtitles on screen informed the viewers about what the suffering contestants were reading). At the end of the auction, the suffering contestants would earn exactly the same prize the contestants earned, and they had {{to see some of the}} best prizes go unclaimed without being able to do anything about it. The suffering contestants would be present on the show until the eighth season.|$|R
2500|$|The 2007 Louis Vuitton Cup started {{slowly with}} all races {{postponed}} {{for the first}} four days of competition due to light and variable winds. There were rumors that BMW Oracle was planning on rotating the crew off the boat because they were running out of stories to tell as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boat waiting for wind. To entertain fans, some teams came up with interesting stunts. For instance, United Internet Germany came {{up with a way to}} wakeboard, by having their largest sail trimmers pull on the wakeboarder using the jib trimming system. [...] +39, an Italian challenger, used the windless days off to continue making repairs to their mast, which shattered in a starboard-port situation with Internet Team Germany two weeks earlier, and completed mast repairs by the time racing had commenced.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 January 1981, 86-year-old Sir Norman Stronge, Bt, former Speaker of the UK Houses of Parliament, and {{his only}} son, James, 48 (both former MPs) were murdered by the Provisional Irish Republican Army. The house was then burnt to the ground. The {{bodies of the}} father and son were later {{recovered}} from their blazing home. The two men were targeted as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main library of their 230-year-old mansion. Members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army forced entry into the Abbey by bombing the heavy front doors. Afterward the building was fire-bombed. The fire raged until the next morning, destroying the contents of the Abbey, and the house burned to the ground. Gerry Adams stated about the elder Stronge, “The only complaint I have heard from Nationalists or anti-Unionists is that he was not shot 40 years ago.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Rivette {{submitted}} {{his film}} to the Institut des Hautes Études Cinématographiques because it [...] "was {{the kind of}} thing that would have pleased my parents", he was not accepted by the school. He took courses at the Sorbonne, but began frequenting screenings at Henri Langlois's Cinémathèque Française with Bouchet instead of attending classes. At the Cinémathèque, Rivette, [...] Claude Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Suzanne Schiffman, Gruault and Bouchet were immersed <b>in</b> films from <b>the</b> silent and early [...] "talkie" [...] eras that they were previously unfamiliar with. He and this group of young cinephiles became acquainted as <b>they</b> customarily <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cinématographique's front row for screenings; Rivette met Truffaut at a screening of The Rules of the Game, and sat next to Godard for several months before the latter introduced himself. Rivette was active in post-screening debates, and Rohmer said that in film-quiz competitions at the Studio Parnasse he was [...] "unbeatable". Rivette credited Langlois's screenings and lectures for helping him persevere during his early impoverishment in Paris: [...] "A word from you saved me and opened the doors of the temple". Unlike his contemporaries, Rivette attended screenings at the Cinémathèque well into the 1970s.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 This study {{sought to}} fill a void in {{research}} literature supporting Attention Restoration Theory (ART) and the beneficial effects of exposure to natural, green spaces. The literature predominantly discusses studies with adult and older child participants, finding that exposure to natural environments often produces an attention-restoring effect. ART has been studied for effects among adult and adolescent populations; children over age seven have largely been excluded. Participants {{in this study were}} preschoolers aged 3 - 5 years. They were exposed in three conditions to a maze task to focus their attention and then alternately asked (1) to sit quietly, (2) look out a window and describe the view, and (3) to sit on a bench in a patio garden. After each exposure condition, they repeated the maze task to determine their perceptions and reactions to the garden space. Children were randomly selected to begin their interviews <b>in</b> each of <b>the</b> three conditions. Qualitative analysis of their responses revealed expressions of positive regard and interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> patio garden being provided only when <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> it. Describing <b>the</b> view out the classroom window, they listed slightly more natural than built elements; when sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garden they talked more about natural than built elements. They appeared to remain focused on indoor activities in Conditions 1 and 2 and more focused on external or outdoor activities in Condition 3 (sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garden). <b>In</b> research adults commonly report feelings of relaxation when viewing a garden, <b>the</b> children <b>in</b> this sample {{did not appear to be}} affected in any way by viewing it distally. Only when immersed in it did they indicate enjoyment of it. This suggests that children may perceive and experience space differently than adults do...|$|R
