The amplitudes and modes of vibration are computed using Barkan´s formulation, and the “High-Cycle Accumulation” (HCA) model is employed to account for accumulated deformations due to {{the high number of}} cycles. The methodology is simple: it can be easily incorporated into standard mathematical software, and HCA model parameters can be estimated based on granulometry and index properties. Special attention is devoted to ‘transient’ situations at equipment´s start-up, during which a range of frequencies – including frequencies that could be similar to the natural frequencies of the ground – is traversed. Results show that such <b>transient</b> <b>situations</b> could be more restrictive than stationary situations corresponding to normal operation. Therefore, checking the stationary situation only might not be enough, and studying the influence of <b>transient</b> <b>situations</b> on computed permanent displacements is needed to produce a proper foundation desig...|$|R

However, water flow numerical simulation in urban pipe systems may require to model transitions between surface flow and pressurized flow in steady and <b>transient</b> <b>situations.</b> The governing equations for both flow types are different and this {{must be taken into}} account in order to get a complete numerical model for solving dynamically transients.

40|$|Proper {{prediction}} of drain discharge using the single node Vimoke and Taylor approach in a numerical simulation model requires an additional correction factor. This correction factor was calibrated and dependent on node size, drain radius {{and the way}} of averaging the hydraulic conductivity. For a <b>transient</b> <b>situation</b> the additional correction factor resulted in higher groundwater levels and lower drain discharges. Drains are special internal or boundary conditions in numerical simulation models. Instead of approximating them by a hole surrounded by a very dense grid of finite elements, the single node or single element approach based on the theory of Vimoke and Taylor proposed in 1962 offers a good alternative. Several authors {{have suggested that the}} Vimoke and Taylor constant to adapt the hydraulic conductivity of the element representing the drain should be changed by a certain factor. However, different correction factors have been given. Here this correction factor is derived for a control volume finite element numerical simulation model for different ratios {{of the size of the}} control volume representing the drain and the effective drain radius. It is shown that this relationship is dependent on the way the hydraulic conductivity is averaged at the interfaces between the neighboring control volumes. The relationships were obtained by optimization against an analytical solution for a steady-state, saturated situation. By applying the additional correction to a hypothetical <b>transient</b> <b>situation</b> for four soil types it was shown that the application of the additional correction factor resulted in 3 to 13 % lower drain discharges compared to uncorrected simulations. Consequently, higher groundwater levels of on average 2 to 4 cm were obtained when applying the additional correction. For situations where exact predictions of drain discharge are needed, typically when solute transport is considered, it is advised to make use of the additional correction. Model specific correction factors may be required...|$|E

Contrary to model predictions, we found a negative relationship between the effect of herbivores on resin bag soil N availability and plant N concentration. Our study confirms the importance of plant N concentration as a predictor of herbivore effect on soil N availability across grasslands, but contradicts the models. A possible explanation may be that the results represent a <b>transient</b> <b>situation</b> as the exclosures were relatively young whereas the models may refer to an equilibrium state. Simultaneous measurements of both plant N concentration and herbivore effect on soil N availability from more grassland sites, preferably with contrasting plant N concentrations and including exclosures of different ages, should resolve the contrast between model predictions and our field measurements...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a fundamental challenge when using silicon oxide nanochannels for analytical systems, namely {{the occurrence of}} a strong proton release or proton uptake from the walls in any <b>transient</b> <b>situation</b> such as channel filling. Experimentally, when fluorescein solutions were introduced into silicon oxide nanochannels through capillary pressure, a distinct bisection of the fluorescence was observed, the zone of the fluid near the entrance fluoresced, while the zone near the meniscus, was dark. The ratio between the zones {{was found to be}} constant in time and to depend on ionic strength, pH, and the presence of a buffer and its characteristics. Theoretically, using the Gouy-Chapman-Stern model of the electrochemical double layer, we demonstrate that this phenomenon can be effectively modeled as a titration of the solution by protons released from silanol groups on the walls, {{as a function of the}} pH and ionic strength of the introduced solution. The results demonstrate the dominant influence of the surface on the fluid composition in nanofluidic experiments, in transient situations such as filling, and changes in solvent properties such as the pH or ionic strength. The implications of these fundamental properties of silicon oxide nanochannels are important for analytical strategies and in particular the analysis of complex biological samples...|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide Project W- 236 A, Multi-function Waste Tank Facility, (MWTF) Project File documentation on the selection of the heat removal capability that MWTF Tank Ventilation Systems will be designed to remove. This information is necessary for designing a heat removal system to prevent the thermal limits of the tank structure from being exceeded. It is important to note that this paper is not for defining the tank mixer pump requirements, but is to be only used for defining and defending the normal heat generation rate that the ventilation system and other heat removal systems will be designed to remove. There are three main heat loads in the tanks of which two can be controlled to a certain extent through operational considerations. These two are mixing pump heat and heat of chemical addition. The third heat source is radionuclide content which can only be controlled by what wastes are pumped to the tank and whether it is diluted prior to pumping. Other heat loads such as transfer pumps were considered to be negligible. In addition, chemical addition is considered a <b>transient</b> <b>situation</b> that is rarely performed and will be treated as such...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{most parts}} of China, {{mosquitoes}} {{have been subjected to}} organophosphate (OP) insecticide treatments since the mid- 1960 s, and resistance gene monitoring in the Culex pipiens complex (Diptera: Culicidae) started in only a few locations {{from the end of the}} 1980 s. Many resistant alleles at the Ester locus have been found in field populations, including those commonly found around the world (Ester B 1 and Ester 2), and those endemic to China (Ester B 6, Ester B 7, Ester 8, and Ester 9). This situation is atypical, and may represent a complex situation for the evolution of insecticide resistance genes in China. To increase our understanding of the Chinese situation and our ability to manage resistance in the C. pipiens complex, a large study was performed. Twenty field populations were sampled from Beijing to Guangzhou. Bioassays with five insecticides (dichlorvos, parathion, chlorpyrifos, 2 - sec-butylphenyl methyl carbamate, and propoxur) disclosed resistance levels variable according to the geographic origin, and up to 85 -fold for dichlorvos.

This situation is further complicated by the emergence and rapid progression of resistance to chloroquine, the recommended first line treatment. In order to document the level of resistance of P. falciparum to chloroquine, pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine (Fansidar) and quinine, we performed a survey in Tabou district, Côre d'Ivoire, from June to August 1995. This area has been hosting some 100, 000 Liberian refugees since September 1994. Children aged 1 to 15 years old attending the dispensary with a complain of fever or suspected malaria, were included into the study, diagnosed and followed for 7 days according to the WHO Standard Field (in vivo) Tests. Overall proportion of P. falciparum resistant to chloroquine reached 45. 1 % and was made of 34. 3 % type II and 10. 8 % type III resistance. Being less than 5 years of age and having received a lower dose of drug were 2 factors associated with the risk of resistance to chloroquine. Levels of R II resistance to pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine and quinine (3 -day treatment) were respectively 5. 4 % and 4. 2 %. No R III resistance was found in neither pyrimethaminelsulfadoxine or quinine treatment groups. These results challenge the current chloroquine-based first line malaria treatment in Côre d'Ivoire. Alternative based on pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine could be considered, especially in high risk populations during <b>transient</b> <b>situation</b> (refugees).

40|$|Purpose – Aims {{to examine}} the value of {{manufacturer}} access to downstream demand information in managing product introductions and to Identify factors affecting this value. Design/methodology/approach – Simulation based on actual data on 19 product introductions is used for comparing different types of demand information and their usefulness to a manufacturer. Two metrics are introduced. Bias indicates {{if there is a}} consistent difference between demand information from two sources. Delay in demand synchronization measures how long it takes for demand information from two sources to start conveying demand similarly in a <b>transient</b> <b>situation.</b> Findings – Finds that, in the supply chain examined, demand variability is mainly induced by distributors, whereas bias and delay in demand synchronization are mainly induced by retail outlets, especially for products with large wholesale packages compared with their sales. Research limitations/implications – The simulation model is simple and does not enable realistic examination of how a manufacturer could best use downstream demand data in managing its operations. Further research including such mechanisms as forecasts and stock-outs is needed. Practical implications – Provides a means for manufacturers to assess when they should invest in gaining access to downstream demand information and to estimate when their traditional information sources start to accurately convey end-customer demand for new products. Originality/value – Although {{it has been suggested that}} the value of access to downstream demand information could be greatest in situations with transient or irregular demand, such as product introductions, this claim has not yet been thoroughly examined.
