5000|$|Another {{field of}} {{research}} is the appearance and propagation of tears in the fabric, this issue has been partially investigated [...] and represents a fundamental data in {{the determination of the}} safety factor which should be used for a specific structure. Because <b>tear</b> <b>propagation</b> generally occurs at 25% UTS, the safety factor is generally higher than four. The test is carried out on a sample taken from a dismounted structure or by using conditioned samples of fabric which aim to reproduce the in-situ conditions. The load profile should reproduce the expected overload by pulling the sample until breakage, which should start far from the sample edge and the clamping system. The repetition of the test and different temperatures (generally -20 °C and +70 °C) offers important information about the joint behaviour at extreme conditions, such as heavy snow fall with temperatures below zero or a blast of wind during a hot summer. This type of test is generally required by designers and manufacturers and those in charge of the evaluation of the structure behaviour and the final test of the structure. Finally, in order to prevent collapses due to ponding and fluttering, the creep behaviour should be carefully considered in the design, choosing anchorages which enable periodical re-tensioning according to the predicted fall in the level of pre-stress. It is based on a monoaxial test but an accurate investigation requires the use of virgin cruciform samples of fabric and the force is applied by means of counter weights. The creep is defined as the “increase in strain with time when a constant force is applied” [...] and aims to describe the material behaviour when a constant force is applied {{over a long period of}} time. This has a considerable effect on the design and realisation of the membrane structure because a progressive increase in the material strain leads to a considerable reduction in the level of pre-stress initially induced in the structure. The sample should be maintained at a constant temperature and for specific applications it may require a proper climatic chamber for investigations at high and low temperatures.There are no complete studies about the dynamic behaviour of coated fabric and foils for structural applications. A dynamic test on coated fabrics can evaluate the response under fast loading and unloading cycles due to blasts of wind or other sources of stress. It should consider a conditioned fabric which reproduces the in-situ conditions and the testing apparatus should be able to apply a high speed load profile which is generally not possible with a common testing rig equipped with electric servomotors. The results of this type of test, despite the absence of research which can support these expectations, can highlight anomalies in the fabric strength and in the <b>tear</b> <b>propagation</b> with consequent adjustments in the safety factor applied.|$|E

Our model shows that the dissection tends to propagate radiallyoutwards. Interestingly, the critical pressure is higher for both very short and very longtears. The simulations also reveal that the inner wall buckles for longer tears, whichis supported by clinical CT scans. In all simulated cases, the critical pressureis foundto increase with the opening angle.

40|$|The {{eastern part}} of the Hellenic {{subduction}} zone is composed of the Pliny and Strabo "trenches" that have been regarded as a zone of convergence between the subducting African lithosphere and the overriding Anatolian-Aegean plate. In the Pliny and Strabo "trenches", the oblique relative plate motion is generally thought to be accommodated by a typical strain partitioning consisting of strike-slip and convergence components. Notwithstanding the occurrence of strike-slip motion parallel with the Pliny-Strabo "trenches", trench-normal thrusting is not observed so far. Therefore, we conducted a detailed analysis to investigate the deformation mechanisms of the {{eastern part of}} the Hellenic Trench system. Our analyses of offshore faulting and mechanisms of earthquakes in the overriding Aegean lithosphere show that the region of the Pliny and Strabo "trenches" obeys the mechanics of the sinistral shear zone model of Tchalenko (1970). We propose that the trench perpendicular convergence is taken up by the Rhodes fold and thrust belt, which has been postulated off the southeast coast of Rhodes. Several regional P-wave tomography results give indications of a slow seismic anomaly under this zone, which is interpreted as a tear between the Hellenic and Cyprus subduction zones. The primary reason for such <b>tear</b> and its <b>propagation</b> is the ongoing rollback of the subducted part of the African lithosphere, also referred to as "the Aegean slab".

40|$|Hot tearing {{continues}} to be a major problem in both Direct Chill (DC) and shape casting of aluminium alloys. It can limit productivity and influence the viability of casting some alloy compositions. While the underlying cause of hot tearing is understood i. e. the inability of liquid to feed imposed strain on the mushy material (two-phase region where developing solid and liquid coexist), work continues on improving the understanding of the mechanisms at play. There have been numerous hot tear experiments developed using different configurations and various levels of complexity. There have also been many models developed to predict hot tearing. Some are empirical in nature or based upon the solidification characteristics of a given alloy while others are more detailed and take into consideration parameters such as solidification shrinkage, thermal contraction and permeability. The objective of this thesis was to develop {{a better understanding of the}} hot tear process and to determine the fundamental mechanisms that lead to this phenomenon. Hot tear experiments were conducted using the CAST Hot Tear experimental rig at the University of Queensland on a range of Al-Cu and Al-Zn alloys. Hot tear severity was quantified and compared with published work. Data from the experiments was also used to validate some established models. The experimental rig was also modified to allow visual observation of hot <b>tear</b> initiation and <b>propagation.</b> Hot tensile testing was also carried out on selected Al-Cu alloys to assess the suitability of using the reheating method to study hot tearing. However, comparison of results with hot tear testing was difficult as the slow reheating rate in the hot tensile tests allowed solid-state diffusion to occur. With hot tear testing of both Al-Cu and Al-Zn alloys, it was found that as the solute content increased, tensile coherency (fraction solid at which load development began) occurred at lower fraction solids. In the Al-Cu alloys, it was found that the type of tearing varied with solute content. At low solute levels there was generally a single large primary tear in both grain refined and non-grain refined alloys. As the solute level increased, the large primary tear gradually diminished and was replaced by smaller secondary tears distributed over a wider area. In the grain refined alloys, the smaller secondary tears transitioned into distributed porosity as the solute content increased further. Hot tear susceptibility results from the Al-Cu alloys correlated well with other published studies, particularly with data from an experimental rig with a similar configuration (where feeding is provided to the central hot spot). The results also correlated well with established hot tear models. In the Al-Zn alloys, hot tear susceptibility results did not correlate with previous studies. This variation was attributed to differences in the design of the experimental rig. The CAST Hot Tear rig provides liquid feeding to the central hot spot while the experimental rigs used in previous studies did not. However, susceptibility results correlated well with hot tearing models that were based on permeability of the mushy material. Visual observation of hot tearing showed that intergranular tears first appeared at very low loads in the centre of the cast bar and later linked with interdendritic tears through a sidewall grain. With a given test geometry and cooling conditions, it is argued that hot tearing susceptibility is determined by the tensile coherency point and the permeability of the mushy material at that point. Therefore, it is proposed that there are two mechanisms that can lead to hot tearing. The first occurs when feeding becomes insufficient due to low permeability before tensile coherency occurs. This leaves a void between opposing solidification fronts and is characterised by the presence of just one primary tear. Alternatively, the classic tear mechanism occurs when feeding becomes insufficient after tensile coherency. The extent and localisation of tearing is dependant upon how early tensile coherency occurs and how long afterwards feeding becomes insufficient. In addition, a hot tear susceptibility map has been developed to visually represent the combined influence of tensile coherency and permeability on hot tearing susceptibility...|$|R
40|$|The {{prediction}} of soft-tissue failure may yield {{a better understanding}} of the pathogenesis of arterial dissection and help to advance diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this and other diseases and injuries involving the tearing of soft tissue, such as aortic dissection. In this paper, we present computational models of <b>tear</b> <b>propagation</b> in fibre-reinforced soft tissue undergoing finite deformation, modelled by a hyperelastic anisotropic constitutive law. We adopt the appropriate energy argument for anisotropic finite strain materials to determine whether a tear can propagate when subject to internal pressure loading. The energy release rate is evaluated with an efficient numerical scheme that makes use of adaptive tear lengths. As an illustration, we present the calculation of the energy release rate for a two-dimensional strip of tissue with a pre-existing tear of length a under internal pressure p and show the effect of fibre orientation. This calculation allows us to locate the potential bifurcation to <b>tear</b> <b>propagation</b> in the (a,p) plane. The numerical predictions are verified by analytical solutions for simpler cases. We have identified a scenario of tear arrest, which is observed clinically, when the surrounding connective tissues are accounted for.

40|$|Arteries are the {{highways}} through which oxygen-rich blood flows toward oxygen-hungry organs, {{such as the}} kidneys, heart, and brain. An arterial dissection is an axial tear within the arterial wall, which may create a false lumen {{by the action of}} blood flow through the <b>tear.</b> <b>Propagation</b> of the tear can quickly lead to death as a result of decreased blood supply to other organs, damage to the aortic valve, and sometimes rupture of the artery. This thesis aims to develop computational models to simulate the inflation and propagation of a tear in the arterial wall and to investigate the mechanical issues in arterial dissection, with mainly focusing on the effects of the fibre orientation, geometry of the tear and residual stress on dissection propagation. The numerical methods used in our models include both the finite element method and the extended finite element method. We assume the mechanical response of the arterial wall is nonlinear, hyperelastic and anisotropic, and use the Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden (HGO) strain energy function as the constitutive law. A finite element computational framework, for the calculation of the energy release rate for a fibre-reinforced soft tissue subject to internal pressure, is developed. This model extends the Griffith failure theory such that we can consider pressure-driven <b>tear</b> <b>propagation</b> subject to a large nonlinear deformation of the arterial wall. Using this model to simulate the <b>tear</b> <b>propagation</b> in strips from the arterial wall, we found the increase in the length of a tear elevates the likelihood of propagation, and if the tissues surrounding the tear are stiff enough this leads to arrest. Simulations of peeling- and pressure-driven <b>tear</b> <b>propagation</b> are performed through the extended finite element method. Peeling-driven propagation is caused by a displacement boundary condition, while pressure-driven propagation is due to pressure loading. We found the tear is likely to propagate along the material axis with the maximum stiffness, which is determined by the fibre orientation in the arterial wall. In models of pressure-driven <b>tear</b> <b>propagation,</b> we investigate the effect of the radial depth and circumferential length of a tear in the cross-section of a two-layer (media and adventitia) arterial wall model. The results show that a shallow and long tear leads to buckling of the inner wall (material section between tear and lumen), while a deep tear tends to propagate. Several shapes of deformed arterial wall with a tear predicted from our simulations are similar to CT images of arterial dissections. The critical pressure for propagation increases with the depth for a very short tear, but decreases for a long tear. Two methods of introducing residual stress, quantified by an opening angle, into a finite element model for the arterial wall are proposed. The computational programs, of using programming languages including Linux shell script, sed, AWK, Python and Matlab, to automatically build finite element models with both methods are developed. We have used them to investigate the effect of residual stress on the critical pressure for <b>tear</b> <b>propagation</b> in the cross-section of the two-layer arterial wall model. The first method is to import the analytical residual stress into a finite element model as an initial stress field, while the second method is to use a residual stress computed numerically. The first method is illustrated with the neo-Hookean material model, and the second method is used with the HGO material model. We find a similar trend of the critical pressure against the opening angles: the critical pressure increases with the opening angle. However, the increase of the critical pressure is less steep in the HGO model compared to the neo-Hooken model. This is presumably due to the interaction of the fibres. When more fibres are stretched, the loading bearing is shifted more towards the fibre structure, and the influence of the residual stress becomes less. The implementation of an anisotropic hyperelastic material model with growth, for a living fibrous soft tissue, in a finite element program is presented. The problem of loss of anisotropy in the conventional approach when using the volumetric-isochoric decomposition of deformation gradient is analysed. A possible solution is suggested: avoiding use of this decomposition in the parts associated with anisotropy in the strain energy function. This suggestion is demonstrated through several examples using the Fung-type and HGO material models. The essential derivation of the HGO material model is presented for its finite element implementation with both the conventional approach and our suggestion. The corresponding user-subroutines used in a finite element program FEAP are included. In addition, the growth of tissue is also considered in this subroutine by introducing a growth tensor as a material parameter. The method on how to update this subroutine to consider a stress-, strain- or energy-driven growth law is discussed, which could be used to model the <b>tear</b> <b>propagation</b> in a living fibrous tissue. In summary, this thesis presents computational techniques for modelling dissection of the arterial wall. These models characterise the mechanical factors in the arterial dissection, which could be adapted for other damage and failure of soft tissue.

40|$|The risk of {{developing}} a degenerative rotator cuff tear increases dramatically with age, reaching over 50 % in the 7 th decade of life. The severe pain and loss of function brought on by rotator cuff tears {{underscores the importance of}} swift and effective treatment. Unfortunately, failure rates for treating rotator cuff tears remain high. Unsuccessful treatment may relate to failure to restore joint kinematics or propagation of the rotator cuff tear. Furthermore, it is not clear which types of tears (i. e. geometry and amount of degeneration) will result in propagation. Therefore, the objective of this work was to investigate the effects of exercise therapy and initial tear characteristics on alteration of glenohumeral kinematics and <b>tear</b> <b>propagation.</b> Glenohumeral joint kinematics were measured in subjects with an isolated supraspinatus tear before and after 12 weeks of therapy. Although exercise therapy does not increase sub-acromial space, therapy decreases the overall joint contact path length by 36 %, indicating a more stable joint. Cadaveric experiments measured <b>tear</b> <b>propagation</b> for increasing levels of loading using a novel cyclic loading protocol. Anterior supraspinatus tears propagate at lower loads than tears in the middle third (389 ± 237 N vs 714 ± 168 N). Mechanical testing also showed that tendons with pre-existing rotator cuff tears are not more likely to propagate than artificial tears representative of a “traumatic” rotator cuff tear (408 ± 86 N vs 580 ± 181). Histological analysis on cadavers (age 50 - 80) found no differences in degeneration between intact and torn supraspinatus tendons, indicating that age-related degeneration is a wide-spread phenomenon that can lead to the initiation of rotator cuff tears. Using experimental data, finite element models of supraspinatus tendon were validated and used to predict effects of tear size, location, and degeneration on propagation. Overall, the model found that larger, more degenerative tears in the anterior third of the supraspinatus tendon are most at risk for propagation. These results provide valuable information to improve treatment of rotator cuff tears based on tear characteristics at diagnosis, by focusing on improving joint kinematics and advocating for early treatment of degenerative tears that interrupt the rotator cable structure...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the hypothesis that}} exogenous collagen cross-linking can augment intact regions of tendon to mitigate mechanical propagation of partial tears. We first screened the low toxicity collagen cross-linkers genipin, methylglyoxal and ultra-violet (UV) light {{for their ability to}} augment tendon stiffness and failure load in rat tail tendon fascicles (RTTF). We then investigated cross-linking effects in load bearing equine superficial digital flexor tendons (SDFT). Data indicated that all three cross-linking agents augmented RTTF mechanical properties but reduced native viscoelasticity. In contrast to effects observed in fascicles, methylglyoxal treatment of SDFT detrimentally affected tendon mechanical integrity, {{and in the case of}} UV did not alter tendon mechanics. As in the RTTF experiments, genipin cross-linking of SDFT resulted in increased stiffness, higher failure loads and reduced viscoelasticity.

The material parameters which have an influence on the properties are: the nature of the elastomer matrix (natural or synthetic rubber) and of the reinforcing fillers (carbon black or silica), the volume fraction and dispersion state of the fillers, the nature and strength of interactions at filler-matrix interfaces. This work is an experimental study of the resistance to failure and to tearing of uniaxially stretched samples. The various systems which have been studied are presented first. Their mechanical properties have been characterized in the various regimes of strain amplitude. The various samples have been compared systematically in order to clarify the effect of the various material parameters. Natural rubber crystallizes under strain. This phenomenon is very sensitive to the formulation of the various materials and has a tremendous effect on mechanical and ultimate properties. Thus, we have measured quantitatively the amount of crystallinity induced as a function of the applied strain during elongation cycles and up to sample failure. The influence of the nature and volume fraction of the fillers and of the matrix-filler interfaces has been studied. The crystallinity is close to 13 % in all studied materials. In samples filled with silica, the nature of the filler-matrix interactions (covalent coupling vs no coupling) has very little influence on crystallization, whereas it modifies strongly the mechanical properties. Then we have studied the resistance to failure of uniaxially stretched pre-notched test samples. Within a macroscopic approach, we have related the ultimate property (energy density at break) to the various <b>tear</b> <b>propagation</b> modes which are observed. We have studied the effect of temperature and drawing speed. It has been shown that the higher resistance to failure of reinforced natural rubber is related to the appearance of spectacular instabilities of the propagation direction (the so-called ‘tear rotation’). The appearance of tear rotation is specific to pre-notched reinforced natural rubber samples. The physical mechanisms responsible for tear rotation are not yet fully understood. The combination of reinforcement due to fillers and of strain-induced crystallization may lead to a strong anisotropy of the elastic material constant of the material in front of the tear tip, and this might be the driving force for tear rotation. The rotation length has been identified as an important parameter which correlates well to the ultimate properties. The <b>tear</b> <b>propagation</b> is described at various scales. The typical length scales associated to tear rotation which are observed have been related to the material properties. L'ajout de charges (agrégat de taille submicronique) dans une matrice élastomère apporte des propriétés physiques qualitativement différentes de celles de la matrice pure : module complexe dépendant de la température, forts effets non linéaires, forte dissipation [...] . Ces propriétés sont liées à la nature de la matrice et des charges, à leur fraction volumique, et enfin à la force des interactions charge / matrice. Nous présentons d'abord les différents systèmes et la caractérisation de leurs propriétés mécaniques, de façon à clarifier le rôle des différents paramètres. La cristallisation sous traction du caoutchouc naturel a un effet important sur ses propriétés mécaniques. Nous l'avons donc mesurée quantitativement dans chacune des formulations. Nous montrons que le taux de cristallisation à la rupture est toujours de l'ordre de 13 %. La nature de l'interface silice / matrice a un effet sur les propriétés mécaniques mais pas sur la cristallisation. Nous avons ensuite étudié le comportement en traction simple d'échantillons pré-entaillés. Nous montrons que la plus grande résistance à la propagation d'entaille du caoutchouc naturel renforcé est corrélée à la présence d'instabilités de propagation (rotation d'entaille). Les mécanismes physiques à l'origine de la rotation d'entaille ne sont pas compris. Nous décrivons la dynamique de propagation des rotations à différentes échelles, et les caractéristiques des rotations. La combinaison de la cristallisation induite et de la présence des charges induit dans le matériau une très grande anisotropie qui pourrait être à l'origine des rotations...|$|E
40|$|Tear {{resistance}} at {{the edge}} of a slab is an important parameter controlling the evolution of subduction zones. However, compared with other subduction parameters such as plate strength, plate viscosity, plate thickness and trench width, the dynamics of tearing are poorly understood. Here we obtain a first-order understanding of the dynamics and morphology of subduction zones to resistance during <b>tear</b> <b>propagation,</b> by developing and using a novel computational modelling technique for subducting slabs, with side boundaries described by visco-plastic weak zones, developing into tear faults. Our 3 D model is based upon a visco-plastic slab that sinks into the less dense mantle, generating poloidal and toroidal flows. The asthenospheric mantle field is static and only develops flow due to the subducting slab. We use the finite element code eScript/Finley and the level set method to describe the lithosphere to solve this fluid dynamics problem. Our results show the importance of tear resistance for the speed of trench migration and for shaping the final geometry of subduction systems. We show that slab tearing along a weak layer can result in a relatively straight slab hinge shape, while increasing the strength in the weak layer results in the curvature of the hinge increasing substantially. High tear resistance at the slab edges may hinder rollback to the extent that the slab becomes stretched and recumbently folded at the base of the domain. Tear resistance also controls whether the subducting lithosphere can experience accelerating rollback velocities or a constant rollback velocity. © 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Flexible networks {{were obtained by}} radical photo-crosslinking reactions of these macromers. With increasing molecular weight of the macromer the networks obtained showed increasing swelling ratios in chloroform and decreasing glass transition temperatures, reaching a constant value of approximately − 18 °C, which is close to that of linear high molecular weight PTMC. For all prepared networks the creep resistance was high. However, the molecular weight of the macromer strongly influenced the tensile properties of the networks. With increasing molecular weight of the macromer the E-modulus of the networks decreased from 314 MPa (lowest Mn) to 5 MPa (highest Mn), while their elongation at break continuously increased, reaching a very high value of 1200 %. The maximum tensile strength values of the networks were found to first decrease with increasing Mn, but to increase again at values above approximately 10, 000 g mol− 1, at which the networks started to show rubber-like behavior. The toughness (area under the stress–strain curves, W) determined in tensile testing experiments, in <b>tear</b> <b>propagation</b> experiments, and in suture retention strength measurements showed that PTMC networks prepared from the higher molecular weight macromers (Mn > 10, 000 g mol− 1) were tenacious materials. The mechanical properties of these networks compare favorably with those of linear high molecular weight PTMC and well-known elastomeric materials like silicone rubber (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) and natural latex rubber. Additionally they also compare well with those of native blood vessels, which may be of importance {{in the use of}} these materials for the tissue engineering of small diameter blood vessels...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{changes in}} the supraspinatus muscle and tendon architecture, the relationship to fat infiltration {{and the effect of}} <b>tear</b> <b>propagation</b> using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional biomechanics testing using human tissues. The first hypothesis tests the relationship between the anterior and posterior portions of the supraspinatus and the central tendon when normal with no tear (NT), and pathological full thickness tears (FTT) groups. The {{changes in the}} pennation angles and central tendon associated with a FTT and the magnitude of the tear size were all statistically significant. The central tendon was found to lie anterior to the long axis of the supraspinous fossa as it passed laterally towards its insertion in the NT group. This relationship was reversed in the FTT group with the tendon lying more posteriorly or in the long axis. The second study hypothesis was that the degree of fatty infiltration of the supraspinatus is positively correlated to the maximal degree of central tendon retraction (CTR) from its insertion seen on the same MRI. The results found this relationship to be statistically significant. The aims of the cadaveric study were to establish the influence on abduction moments of full thickness tears with specific reference to tears to the central tendon. A new method of testing the biomechanics of in-vitro rotator cuff tears was developed through specimen-specific loading protocols {{through the use of a}} musculoskeletal dynamics model. A pair-wise comparison of the sections then revealed that the sectioning of the central tendon, regardless of whether the tear starts anteriorly or posteriorly, does the most significant damage to the moment producing capacity of supraspinatus. The overall contribution of this thesis is a clear understanding of the functional biomechanics of the central tendon of the supraspinatus in rotator cuff tears. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{documented}} that torn meniscal tissue {{increases the likelihood of}} degenerative arthritis of the knee. Efforts have therefore been directed toward meniscal repair techniques. Surgical adhesives have the theoretical advantage of minimizing the tear gap and providing full contact of the bonded surfaces, which would aid in meniscal repair. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the mechanical strength of a newly discovered biological adhesive (frog glue) and to compare its strength to currently available biological adhesives for meniscal tissue repair. A longitudinal tear was created along the periphery of freshly dissected sheep menisci. Four adhesives were used to reduce the cut surfaces: (1) frog glue (nontoxic, biocompatible glue secreted by an Australian species of frogs of the genus Notaden, n = 12); (2) fibrin glue (n = 11); (3) gelatin glue (n = 12); and (4) cyanoacrylate glue (n = 12). The samples were incubated in wet conditions for 24 hours, tested using a <b>tear</b> <b>propagation</b> method, and the peel strength was calculated. The test groups were compared using analysis of variance. In all cases, tearing occurred along the tissue-adhesive interface. Cyanoacrylate formed a hard brittle film on the glued surfaces, whereas the other glues remained rubbery. The strongest bond (mean ± SEM) was made by the cyanoacrylate glue (149 ± 10 N/m) followed by the frog glue (97 ± 9 N/m). The frog glue was found to be 5 times stronger than the fibrin glue (20 ± 3 N/m), and 2. 5 times stronger than the gelatin glue (39 ± 8 N/m). There was a statistically significant difference between each of the groups (P < 0. 001), except between the gelatin and fibrin glues. Cyanoacrylate provided the strongest bond, whereas gelatin and fibrin glues were weak bonding agents. The frog glue demonstrated superior mechanical strength over the 2 other biological glues. Based on its excellent mechanical properties and advantageous biological and structural characteristics, the frog glue has great potential for further investigations and could be considered for meniscal repair in the future. 5 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Rotator cuff {{tears are}} common and not well {{understood}} shoulder problems. Structural and mechanical inhomogeneity of the supraspinatus tendon complicates accurate prediction of risk of <b>tear</b> <b>propagation</b> and may impact appropriate clinical treatment. The work presented in this thesis dissertation investigates the mechanical interaction between the supraspinatus and the infraspinatus tendons {{as it may be}} critical to understanding load bearing at the glenohumeral joint. Principal strains in the infraspinatus and supraspinatus tendons of cadaveric human shoulders were calculated to evaluate whether a mechanical interaction between the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons exist with: (1) an increase in anterior-side full and partial-thickness supraspinatus tendon tear sizes; (2) change in glenohumeral abduction and rotation angles; (3) increase in supraspinatus tendon load; and 4) two commonly used supraspinatus tendon repairs. Results showed that a mechanical interaction between the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons existed such that in general, conditions that caused increase in strain in the supraspinatus tendon, such as an increase in supraspinatus tendon tear size and load, also caused an increase in strain in the infraspinatus tendon. Results also showed that joint position significantly affects the mechanical interaction between the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons, causing an interruption in the mechanical interactions at joint positions where humeral head contact with the tendon is minimized. Both supraspinatus tendon repair techniques equally restored the mechanical interaction between the two tendons, and mimicked the results of the intact supraspinatus tendon regarding the effect of load and joint position. Changes in infraspinatus tendon strain associated with increases in supraspinatus tendon tear size and loading may shield a torn supraspinatus tendon from further injury or have detrimental chronic effects on the infraspinatus tendon. In conclusion, the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons mechanically interact. The observed significant increase in maximum principal strain and decrease in minimum principal strain was concurrent in both the infraspinatus and supraspinatus tendons except when interrupted at certain joint positions. ...|$|E
40|$|Hot tearing is {{a common}} defect during DC casting of some {{commercial}} aluminum alloys and can result in considerable productivity loss in the cast-house. In order {{to better understand the}} hot tearing, a novel technique, dubbed DCSS for Direct Chill Surface Simulator, has been developed to reproduce the cooling conditions at the mould/liquid metal interface and to generate the unique surface and sub-surface microstructure of the DC ingot. The apparatus has been designed also to apply and measure a tensile load and the surface strain. These mechanical quantities were then used to derive the stress-strain curves that best represent the material behaviour during solidification and its capacity to resist hot tearing. The present work describes the approach used to determine the mechanical resistance of three different aluminum-silicon binary alloys (AI- 0. 5 wt%Si, Al- 1. 5 wt%Si, and Al- 2. 5 wt%Si). In addition, the present work covers the modeling of the heat transfer encountered during the test using commercial software (ProCAST(TM)) to better understand the temperature field upon solidification and tracking the solid fraction. Microstructure analyses were made to obtain various metallurgical quantities (e. g., grain morphology, size), physical measurements and thorough investigation of the torn surfaces. Information was used as inputs to the various models developed and used in the present work. A theoretical model was updated from previous work using more realistic metallurgical quantities. This research led also {{to the development of a}} probalistic model (cellular automata) to simulate the microstructure of the cast sample. The model has been used to determine a crack propagation coefficient (CPC) that was used in the theoretical model to better represent the hot <b>tear</b> <b>propagation.</b> Work to include even more complex coupled phenomena such as creep phenomena and microsegregation are not covered in the present scope of this work. Hypotheses are raised according to experimental work and observations made that suggest their most probable contributions. These studies have advanced to a certain degree the scientific understanding of hot tearing such as the inherent mechanical behaviour during solidification. In addition, the DCSS was used successfully to rank DC cast commercial wrought alloys in terms of hot tearing susceptibility...|$|E
40|$|Conditions and {{dynamics}} of subduction-collision and subsequent 3 -D slab break-off and slab <b>tear</b> <b>propagation</b> are quantified, {{for the first}} time, using fully dynamic numerical models. Model results indicate that collision after the subduction of old, strong subducting oceanic slab leads to slab break-off at 20 – 25 Myr after the onset of continental collision, and subsequently a slab tear migrates more or less horizontally through the slab with a propagation speed of 100 – 150 mm/yr. In contrast, young, weak oceanic slabs show the first break-off already 10 Myr after continental collision, and can experience tear migration rates up to 800 mm/yr. Slab strength plays a more {{important role in the}} timing of slab break-off and the speed of a propagating slab tear than (negative) slab buoyancy does. Slab break-off is viable even for slabs that are supported by the viscosity jump and phase change between the upper and lower mantle. The density of the oceanic slab and the subducting continental block is important for the amount of continental subduction and the depth of slab break-off. A 40 -km thick continental crust can be buried to depths greater than 200 km, although this maximum depth is significantly less for younger or very weak slabs, or thicker continental crust. Slab break-off typically starts at a depth of 300 km, mostly independent of mantle rheology, but, like continental crustal burial, can be shallower for young or buoyant plates. Our 3 -D models illustrate how, due to the difference in necking in 2 -D and 3 -D, break-off has an intrinsic small preference to start as a slab window within the slab's interior, rather than as a slab tear at the slab edge. However, any significant asymmetry in the collision setting, e. g. earlier collision {{at one end of the}} subduction zone, would override this, and leads to slab tearing starting near one edge of the slab. These results put important new constraints on the dynamics of the collision and subsequent slab break-off for modern collision belts. For a proposed timing of the initial Arabia–Eurasia collision at 35 Ma, break-off of the 200 -Myr-old Neo-Tethys slab is unlikely to have occurred before 15 – 10 Ma. Furthermore, our results illustrate that shallow, early break-off of weak slabs provides a viable explanation for the absence of blueschists and ultra-high pressure metamorphism in the Precambrian geological record...|$|E
40|$|Solar sails {{have the}} {{potential}} to benefit many future space exploration missions, but they lack the heritage required for present-day use. To grow confidence in solar sail technology, they could be deployed on LEO satellites higher than 600 km to help de-orbit the satellite within 25 years upon mission termination. To determine how atomic oxygen would affect the solar sail, material from Lightsail- 2 was tested in a thermal-energy, isotropic, atomic oxygen vacuum chamber based in the space environments laboratory in California Polytechnic State University. The sail material, aluminized Mylar, was tested for its survivability on both the coated and uncoated side, as well as tested for the optical degradation of the coated side. The uncoated side was found to be completely eroded after a fluence of 2. 27 x 1020 atoms/cm 2, or ~ 40 days in International Space Station orbit. The coated side experienced no mass loss, but signs of significant undercutting were found with a fluence of 1. 19 x 1021 atoms/cm 2, or ~ 200 days at station orbit. The stitches present on the coated side, meant to prevent <b>tear</b> <b>propagation,</b> eroded before the sample experienced a fluence of 4. 13 x 1020 atoms/cm 2, or ~ 70 days at station orbit. The average total reflectivity of the material dropped by ~ 5 % after atomic oxygen exposure, however no correlation with fluence was found. Average specular reflectivity remained unchanged after atomic oxygen exposure. The reflectivity results were impacted by wrinkling in the material, which was found to have a much larger impact than atomic oxygen exposure. These results were paired with an optimal de-orbit trajectory algorithm, developed in this thesis, to determine how atomic oxygen would affect a solar sail deployed to de-orbit an 800 km LEO satellite with a ballistic coefficient of 0. 1. Using a simplified 2 D orbit case, {{it was found that the}} satellite would de-orbit within 12 - 18 years, depending primarily on the solar activity level. The measured worst-case for optical degradation increased de-orbit time by ~ 6 months. Additionally, assuming that the sail material was perfectly reflecting decreased de-orbit time by 2 - 4 years. The amount of fluence required to erode the uncoated Mylar, and the amount required to erode the stitches, were both reached long before the satellite re-entered. It is therefore recommended that the solar sail minimize uncoated side exposure to atomic oxygen, and a more atomic oxygen-resistant stitch material be found. The fluence required to produce significant material undercutting was reached only once the satellite’s orbit had degraded to below 400 km. But the undercutting was observed to structurally compromise the material; thus, future LEO solar sail mission designers must take care when balancing added performance with higher failure risk when considering the tension in the deployed sail...|$|E
