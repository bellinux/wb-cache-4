In this study we investigated the functional role of different modes of cell death that mediate anticancer effect of lupulone derivatives in prostate cancer cells. ELISA, immunoblotting and siRNA approaches were utilised to study cell death, expression of proteins of interest and their functional activities. We found that the anticancer effect of lupulone derivatives on prostate cancer cells is associated with induction of apoptosis and autophagy as determined by increases of DNA fragmentation and LC 3 I/ LC 3 II conversion respectively. Inhibition of apoptosis using a pan-caspase inhibitor resulted in increased levels of autophagy. Following screening of proteins associated with autophagy we found that Atg 4 β expression was increased in prostate cancer cells after treatment with lupulone. Transfection of cells with siRNA against Atg 4 β resulted in increased levels of apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Treatment of prostate cancer cells with lupulone derivatives initiated two modes of cell death: apoptosis as a killing pathway and autophagy as a protection against cell death. Further studies are required to investigate <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Atg</b> 4 β activity in lupulone derivatives-induced negative crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy...|$|E

In some scenarios, the induction of autophagy {{is accompanied by}} increased levels of certain ATG mRNAs such as MAP 1 LC 3 B/LC 3 B, ATG 5 or ATG 12. However, {{little is known about}} <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>ATG</b> protein synthesis at the translational level. The cochaperone of the HSP 70 system BAG 3 (BCL 2 -associated athanogene 3) has been associated to LC 3 B lipidation through an unknown mechanism. In the present work, we studied how BAG 3 controls autophagy in HeLa and HEK 293 cells. Our results showed that BAG 3 regulates the basal amount of total cellular LC 3 B protein by controlling its mRNA translation. This effect was apparently specific to LC 3 B because other ATG protein levels were not affected. BAG 3 knockdown did not affect LC 3 B lipidation induced by nutrient deprivation or proteasome inhibition. We concluded that BAG 3 maintains the basal amount of LC 3 B protein by controlling the translation of its mRNA in HeLa and HEK 293 cells.

40|$|SNCA (α-synuclein) misfolding and {{aggregation}} {{is strongly}} associated with both idiopathic and familial forms of Parkinson disease (PD). Evidence suggests that SNCA {{has an impact on}} cell clearance routes and protein quality control systems such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy. Recent advances in the key role of the autosomal recessive PARK 2 /PARKIN and PINK 1 genes in mitophagy, highlighted this process as a prominent new pathogenic mechanism. Nevertheless, the role of autophagy/mitophagy in the pathogenesis of sporadic and autosomal dominant familial forms of PD is still enigmatic. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a powerful "empty room" model that has been exploited to clarify different molecular aspects associated with SNCA toxicity, which combines the advantage of being an established system for aging research. The contribution of autophagy/mitophagy for the toxicity induced by the heterologous expression of the human wild-type SNCA gene and the clinical A 53 T mutant during yeast chronological life span (CLS) was explored. A reduced CLS together with an increase of autophagy and mitophagy activities were observed in cells expressing both forms of SNCA. Impairment of mitophagy by deletion of ATG 11 or ATG 32 resulted in a CLS extension, further implicating mitophagy in the SNCA toxicity. Deletion of SIR 2, essential for SNCA toxicity, abolished autophagy and mitophagy, thereby rescuing cells. These data show that Sir 2 functions as a regulator of autophagy, like its mammalian homolog, SIRT 1, but also of mitophagy. Our work highlights that increased mitophagy activity, mediated by <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>ATG</b> 32 by Sir 2, is an important phenomenon linked to SNCA-induced toxicity during aging. status: publishe...|$|E

Additionally, ATG 12 has ATG 5 -independent functions in diverse processes including mitochondrial fusion and mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis.

40|$|Throughout {{their life}} cycle, plants adjust growth in {{response}} to their developmental and environmental situation {{within the limits of}} their energetic capacities. This capacity is defined by the local sugar availability, which is constantly modulated through synthesis, transport and consumption of sugar. The monitoring of sugar presence is carried out by a complex signalling network in which simple sugars (e. g. glucose, fructose and sucrose) act as metabolic signals for the modulation of physiological processes. However, often it remains unclear whether <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> is induced by the simple sugars themselves or by their derivatives generated during sugar metabolism. This thesis focuses on the dissection of distinct sugar signals, their generation, perception and impact on the modulation of gene expression and cell division both in cell culture and young seedlings. Based on a stem-cell-like A. thaliana cell culture, which could be sustained in a hormone-free media, a new biological system, supplied with Xyl as the only carbon source was developed. The performance of a variety of sugar and sugar analogue treatments in this novel system allowed for the identification of sugar-responsive candidate genes, which were specifically regulated by glucose, fructose and sucrose. For several genes (e. g. bZIP 63, AT 5 g 22920, TPS 9, MGD 2 and BT 2), this regulation required both sugar transport into the cytosol and metabolisation for the generation of the signal. Furthermore, gene expression analyses in young A. thaliana seedlings indicated the requirement for the catalytic activity of hexokinase 1 in <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> bZIP 63, <b>Atg</b> 22920 and BT 2 under conditions of a perturbed carbohydrate balance. These findings have been combined in a proposed model for <b>the</b> transcriptional <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> bZIP 63, AT 5 g 22920, TPS 9, MGD 2 and BT 2, which further proposes a function of those genes in <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> cell division. <b>The</b> optimisation of a protocol for long-term real-time live-cell imaging provided a valuable tool to show that, similar to gene expression, the progression of cell division depended on a sugar-type-specific <b>regulation</b> at <b>the</b> single-cell level; this regulation was most likely caused by prolongation of the interphase. Together with the observation of cell death and growth arrest of the primary root in intact seedlings {{in response to}} the glucose analogue 2 dog, this led to the conclusion that sugar signals themselves were sufficient to induce cell division. However, the continuation of cell cycle progression and consequently organ growth over long-time required the availability of the energy contained in the sugar...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundAutophagy as a conserved lysosomal/vacuolar {{degradation}} and recycling pathway {{is important in}} normal development and physiology, and defects in this process are linked to many kinds of disease. Because {{too much or too}} little autophagy can be detrimental, the process must be tightly regulated both temporally and in magnitude. Two parameters that affect this <b>regulation</b> are <b>the</b> size and the number of autophagosomes; however, although we know that the amount <b>of</b> <b>Atg</b> 8 affects the size of autophagosomes, the mechanism for regulating their number has not been elucidated. The transcriptional induction and repression <b>of</b> the autophagy-related (<b>ATG)</b> genes is one crucial aspect <b>of</b> autophagy <b>regulation,</b> but <b>the</b> transcriptional regulators that modulate autophagy are not well characterized. ResultsWe detected increased expression levels <b>of</b> <b>ATG</b> genes, and elevated autophagy activity, in cells lacking the transcriptional regulator Pho 23. Using transmission electron microscopy, we found that PHO 23 null mutant cells contain significantly more autophagosomes than the wild-type. By RNA sequencing transcriptome profiling, we identified ATG 9 as one of the key targets of Pho 23, and our studies with strains expressing modulated levels <b>of</b> <b>Atg</b> 9 show that the amount of this protein directly correlates with the frequency of autophagosome formation and the level of autophagy activity.

40|$|AbstractAutophagy is a conserved catabolic {{process that}} {{initially}} involves the bulk or the selective engulfment of cytosolic components into double-membrane vesicles and successively {{the transport of}} the sequestered cargo material into the lysosome/vacuole for degradation. This pathway allows counteracting internal and external stresses, including changes in the nutrient availability, that alter the cell metabolic equilibrium. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> autophagy is crucial for maintaining important cellular functions under various conditions and ultimately {{it is essential for}} survival. Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been successfully employed as a model system to study autophagy.

In addition, this organism also possesses all the principal signaling cascades that modulate the cell metabolism in response to nutrient availability in higher eukaryotes, including the TOR and the PKA pathways. Therefore, yeast is an ideal system to study <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> autophagy by these signaling pathways.

However, the genetic connection between Atg 7 and Hsp 27 is not known. Methods The appearances of the fly eyes from the different genetic interactions with or without polyglutamine toxicity were examined by light microscopy and scanning electronic microscopy. Immunofluorescence was used to check the effect <b>of</b> <b>Atg</b> 7 and Hsp 27 knockdown on the formation of autophagosomes. The lifespan of altered expression of Hsp 27 or Atg 7 {{and that of the}} combination of the two different gene expression were measured. Results We used the Drosophila eye as a model system to examine the epistatic relationship between Hsp 27 and Atg 7. We found that both genes are involved in normal eye development, and that overexpression <b>of</b> <b>Atg</b> 7 could eliminate the need for Hsp 27 but Hsp 27 could not rescue Atg 7 deficient phenotypes. Using a polyglutamine toxicity assay (41 Q) to model neurodegeneration, we showed that both Atg 7 and Hsp 27 can suppress weak, toxic effect by 41 Q, and that overexpression <b>of</b> <b>Atg</b> 7 improves the worsened mosaic eyes by the knockdown of Hsp 27 under 41 Q. We also showed that overexpression <b>of</b> <b>Atg</b> 7 extends lifespan and the knockdown <b>of</b> <b>Atg</b> 7 or Hsp 27 by RNAi reduces lifespan. RNAi-knockdown <b>of</b> <b>Atg</b> 7 expression can block the extended lifespan phenotype by Hsp 27 overexpression, and overexpression <b>of</b> <b>Atg</b> 7 can extend lifespan even under Hsp 27 knockdown by RNAi.
