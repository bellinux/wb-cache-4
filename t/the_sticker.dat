A helmet sticker with the number 38 {{was added to the}} uniforms after John Tuggle, a former running back the Giants selected as the final pick of the 1983 draft, died of angiosarcoma in August 1986. After former defensive back and two-time Pro Bowler Spider Lockhart died of lymphoma in July 1986, a patch with Lockhart's nickname and number were added to the jerseys and the Giants wore both <b>the</b> <b>sticker</b> and the jersey patch the whole season.|$|E

50|$|Unfortunately, the {{popularity}} of <b>the</b> <b>stickers</b> led to trouble for the series. The zeal for trying to obtain Head Seals would lead children to buy Bikkuriman in mass quantities, retrieve <b>the</b> <b>stickers</b> inside, and simply throw away the snack. This, along {{with the fact that}} children and collectors were willing to pay high amounts of money for the rarer cards, led to parent groups expressing concern of possible gambling undertones to <b>the</b> <b>stickers.</b> This led to action by the Japanese Fair Trade Commission, and the number of Head Seals per pack was increased from the average 4 to 24 individual Seals.|$|R

25|$|Undergraduate tuition, {{room and}} board for the 2017–18 {{academic}} year was $62,000 (excluding books, personal expenditures, and health insurance), making Drew among the most expensive private universities in New Jersey.

25|$|Finally, {{the taxi}} driver would provide the {{customer}} with a flyer about the exhibition with a Post-it sticker {{in the shape of}} a wing. The flyer invited the customer to write down their opinion of the exhibition on <b>the</b> <b>sticker</b> and paste it to a wall at MIMA. This wall eventually became an artwork itself, with the stickers positioned as feathers within the contours of a drawing of a large wing. The Hermes-flyers were also available at other places in town, such as waiting rooms of doctors, libraries, the town hall, etcetera. The flyer also entitled a visitor of the exhibition to a 40% discount on a winged Noten ring.|$|E
25|$|Eurasian magpie (Pica pica): The Eurasian magpie is {{the only}} non-mammal to have passed the mirror test. Researchers applied a small red, yellow or black sticker to the throat of five Eurasian magpies, {{where they could be}} seen by the bird only by using a mirror. The birds were then given a mirror. The feel of <b>the</b> <b>sticker</b> on their throats did not seem to alarm the magpies. However, when the birds with {{coloured}} stickers caught a glimpse of themselves in the mirror, they scratched at their throats—a clear indication that they recognised the image in the mirror as their own. Those that received a black sticker, invisible against the black neck feathers, did not react.|$|E

25|$|Discounting {{began in}} the 1970s and was {{dramatically}} expanded in the 1990s, according to one report. Discrepancy between sticker and average net prices can vary substantially. Estimates vary, but show a consistent pattern of sticker prices being much greater than real costs, sometimes more than double, sometimes only {{one and a half}} times as high. Estimates are that 88% or 67% get some form of discount. One estimate in 2015 was that at private nonprofit four-year colleges, the average first-year student pays 48% less than <b>the</b> <b>sticker</b> price. Generally, the sticker-to-net price discrepancy is greater at private colleges than public universities. For example, in 2011–2012, the average sticker price for tuition, fees and living expenses at private colleges, was $38,590 while the average actual cost was $23,060; at public colleges, the average sticker price was $17,130 and the average actual cost was $11,380. Another estimate was that the average full-time undergraduate gets $6,500 in grant aid along with $1,000 in tax-based aid to offset tuition and fees. There is widespread consensus that the most cost-effective college option is community colleges, which charge on average only $3,000 for full-time tuition.|$|E
500|$|The {{court also}} {{evaluated}} {{the constitutionality of}} the Act's labeling provision, which requires that a label be affixed to the front of every package the state deems to be a [...] "violent video game." [...] Generally, [...] "freedom of speech prohibits the government from telling people what they must say." [...] However, the court has upheld compelled commercial speech where it is the inclusion of [...] "purely factual and uncontroversial information" [...] in advertising. However, the labeling requirement of [...] "violent video game" [...] is not factual information. The Act has not clearly and legally provided a way to determine if a video game is violent so <b>the</b> <b>sticker</b> does not convey factual information. Consequently, the court found that the Act is unconstitutional.|$|E
500|$|The title [...] "Rust in Peace" [...] was {{inspired}} by a bumper sticker that Mustaine saw {{on the back of a}} vehicle while driving home from Lake Elsinore, California. <b>The</b> <b>sticker</b> read: 'May all your nuclear weapons rust in peace'. Mustaine liked the concept and decided to use it as a title for Megadeth's upcoming album. Rust in Peace was recorded in Rumbo Studios with producer Mike Clink, while the mixing was handled by Max Norman. Clink was brought in for his work on both Guns N' Roses' Appetite for Destruction and UFO's Strangers in the Night. The producer's work dealt mostly with the bass, drums and Friedman's guitar. In a 2002 interview, Mustaine declared that they [...] "really didn’t make the record with [...] " [...] as at the time he was focused on Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion I and II — which were also being recorded at Rumbo — and stated most of the work in the album was done by himself, Norman, and engineer Micajah Ryan.|$|E

500|$|Boom Box spans mostly No Doubt's later musical style. The two {{greatest}} hits discs, The Singles 1992–2003 and The Videos 1992–2003, take 13 of their 15 or 16 tracks from Tragic Kingdom, Return of Saturn and Rock Steady. Their earlier musical style, {{in which the}} songs were written by keyboard player Eric Stefani, who left the band before Tragic Kingdom was recorded, is represented by only one song—"Trapped in a Box" [...] from No Doubt. The band's musical style changed later when Gwen Stefani started writing the songs; the tracks on Tragic Kingdom, which are heavily represented on Boom Box, are built on the themes of Gwen Stefani's femininity and the breakup of her relationship with fellow band member Tony Kanal. The B-sides and rare songs on Everything in Time were mainly recorded in the sessions for the band's fourth album, Return of Saturn, {{but two of the}} three remixes were of the song [...] "Rock Steady", from No Doubt's album, Rock Steady. Boom Box was given a [...] sticker in the United States because of the content in Live in the Tragic Kingdom, which also received <b>the</b> <b>sticker</b> upon its release.|$|E

Official movie merchandise, consisting of mostly figurines were offered as prizes for the contest. During the film's first three weeks of release in Japan, special Persona 3 themed Bikkuriman stickers were given out to movie goers. Each patron received one sticker at random out of the 29 piece set called [...] "Super PS3 Seals". <b>The</b> <b>sticker</b> artwork was illustrated by Minoru Yonezawa and Satoshi Hyodo of Green House Co.

Due to his unfamiliarity with the series Yonezawa (and Hyodo) found difficulty in deforming the characters. They also drew the design of the special [...] "Tanaka" [...] sticker given to those who placed orders on the Jika Net website.
