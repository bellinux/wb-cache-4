5000|$|For shore-based Optical Landing Systems, {{the lights}} are {{typically}} mounted on a mobile unit that plugs into a power source. Once set up and calibrated, there are no moving parts to the unit. Shipboard units are much more complicated as they must be gyroscopically stabilized to compensate for ship movement. Additionally, shipboard units are mechanically moved (the [...] "roll angle") to adjust the <b>touchdown</b> <b>point</b> of each aircraft. With this adjustment, the tailhook <b>touchdown</b> <b>point</b> can be precisely targeted based on the tailhook-to-pilot's eye distance for each aircraft type.|$|E

50|$|The pilot {{controls}} the aircraft {{so that the}} glide slope indicator remains centered on the display to ensure the aircraft is following the glide path to remain above obstructions and reach the runway at the proper <b>touchdown</b> <b>point</b> (i.e., it provides vertical guidance).|$|E

50|$|For example, a 2000m runway {{could have}} {{reported}} touchdown, midpoint and rollout IRVR values of 700m, 400m and 900m. If the actual RVR at the <b>touchdown</b> <b>point</b> (300m from the threshold) is 700m as reported, then a pilot {{could expect to}} see the light 700m away, at the runway midpoint. If the pilot taxies to the midpoint and looks back through the same air mass, he or she must also {{be able to see the}} light at the <b>touchdown</b> <b>point.</b> But since the midpoint RVR is reported as 400m, a light 700m away must be invisible. Similarly, looking forward he or she cannot see the light in the rollout area. But according to the rollout RVR of 900m, the light there is visible, and has already been so for the last 200m.|$|E

50|$|Pilots usually land {{back at the}} {{airfield}} from which they took off, but a landing is possible in any flat field about 250 metres long. Ideally, should circumstances permit, a glider would fly a standard pattern, or circuit, in preparation for landing, typically starting at a height of 300 metres (1,000 feet). Glide slope control devices are then used to adjust the height to assure landing at the desired point. The ideal landing pattern positions the glider on final approach so that a deployment of 30-60% of the spoilers/dive brakes/flaps brings it to the desired <b>touchdown</b> <b>point.</b> In this way the pilot has the option of opening or closing the spoilers/air-brakes to extend or steepen the descent to reach the <b>touchdown</b> <b>point.</b> This gives the pilot wide safety margins should unexpected events occur.|$|E
50|$|The pilot {{controls}} the aircraft {{so that the}} glide slope indicator remains centered on the display to ensure the aircraft is following the glide path of approximately 3° above horizontal (ground level) to remain above obstructions and reach the runway at the proper <b>touchdown</b> <b>point</b> (i.e., it provides vertical guidance).|$|E
5000|$|In the image, {{the long}} lines running diagonally {{across the screen}} {{represents}} {{the middle of the}} glideslope, the vertical bars are distance markers, and the dashed lines (just visible) represent the [...] "maximum safe distance" [...] an aircraft can stray from the glideslope. The distance between these markers and the centerline decreases closer to the <b>touchdown</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

Two points for a safety or for a defensive turnover off any conversion attempt returned for a touchdown.|$|R
50|$|The use of head-up {{displays}} allows {{commercial aircraft}} substantial flexibility in their operations. Systems {{have been approved}} which allow reduced-visibility takeoffs, and landings, as well as full Category III A landings and roll-outs.

5000|$|Lift/drag ratio also {{determines the}} glide ratio and gliding range. Since the glide ratio is {{based only on}} the {{relationship}} of the aerodynamics forces acting on the aircraft, aircraft weight will not affect it.

50|$|PTOL is {{assisted}} {{in certain cases}} by means which are not needed by {{vertical take-off and landing}} (VTOL) or by short take-off and landing (STOL) vehicles. These may include a very long cable enforcing the convergence of the aircraft from afar onto the intended <b>touchdown</b> <b>point.</b> This may still be worthwhile due to maintaining the air-vehicle's advantages which are maximal simplicity leading to better cruise performance, as is the case using a fixed-wing UAV platform.|$|E
5000|$|Along {{with the}} {{possibility}} of the lander tipping over on sloped surfaces, large topographical features like hills, mesas, craters and trenches pose the problem of interference with ground sensors. Radar and Doppler radar can falsely measure altitude during descent and the algorithms that target the <b>touchdown</b> <b>point</b> of the lander can be [...] "tricked" [...] into releasing the lander too early or late if the craft passes over mesas or trenches while descending.|$|E

50|$|A {{helicopter}} operated {{with heavy}} loads in high density altitude or gusty wind conditions can achieve best performance from a slightly increased airspeed in the descent. At low density altitude and light loading, best performance is achieved from a slight decrease in normal airspeed. Following this general procedure of fitting airspeed to existing conditions, the pilot can achieve {{approximately the same}} glide angle in any set of circumstances and estimate the <b>touchdown</b> <b>point.</b> This optimum glide angle is usually 17-20 degrees.|$|E
