5|$|In 326, Constantine {{reversed}} this pro-equestrian trend, raising many {{administrative positions}} to senatorial rank and thus opening these offices {{to the old}} aristocracy, {{and at the same}} time elevating the rank of already existing equestrian office-holders to senator, degrading the equestrian order —at least as a bureaucratic rank —in the process, so <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the 4th century the title of perfectissimus was granted only to mid-low officials.|$|E

5|$|By 2000 the City of Portland {{had spent}} about $200million to nearly {{eliminate}} CSOs {{from entering the}} slough. It also replaced septic tank and cesspool systems near {{the middle and upper}} slough with sanitary sewers.

Despite these and other improvements in water quality, the slough is not a safe source of edible fish. The Multnomah County Health Department and other agencies have advised people to avoid or greatly reduce consumption of fish and crayfish from the slough because they contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and pesticides.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, as {{a result}} of both {{production}} peaks in some nations and political instability in others, the world's supply of petroleum tightened leading to an energy crisis during the 1970s and early 1980s. Petroleum prices rose dramatically, greatly benefiting Texas, particularly as compared {{to other parts of the}} U.S. that faced recession during this time. A new economic boom emerged which, though not as transformative as the early 1900s, pushed the population of Texas to the point <b>that,</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the century, Texas was the second most populous state in the nation. Some sources, in fact, use the phrase Texas oil boom to refer to this later period rather than the earlier period that followed Spindletop.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 18th Century, French traders first began {{trade with the}} Akokisa and the nearby Bidai tribes for furs. In 1754 several traders {{including}} Joseph Blancpain established a trading post on the Trinity River a {{just north of the}} bay, near modern Wallisville. Spanish authorities quickly seized the post and transformed it into the San Augustín de Ahumada fort. They named the site El Orcoquisac and established a Catholic mission. The Spanish were not successful in maintaining trade with the natives and the post was abandoned within a few years. Encroachment by Spanish as well as U.S. settlers continued such <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the century native populations had declined dramatically due to disease and territorial pressures from the Europeans.|$|E
500|$|An {{example of}} an {{extremely}} positive review was that of Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who called it “a movie of substance and thrilling historical sweep.” A. O.

It shows such sympathy for its characters, and approaches its subject with such intelligence, that it's easy to forgive the clumsy editing, the haphazard insertion of black-and-white newsreels, and the hyperventilating sexual ardor {{that seems to be}} a Sors family curse.” ...|$|R

5|$|Following {{that the}} Allied {{offensive}} continued {{for the next}} four months, right up {{until the end of the}} war. During the Second Battle of the Somme the Australian Corps fought actions at Lihons, Etinehem, Proyart, Chuignes, and Mont St Quentin, before taking part in their final engagement of the war on 5 October 1918 at Montbrehain. Australian casualties during these battles were very high and coupled with the drying up of reinforcements from Australia, the rejection of the proposal to introduce conscription and the granting of home leave to men who been serving since 1914 meant <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the war the AIF was severely stretched to the limit. Consequently, during the height of the offensive it was decided to disband three battalions—the 36th, 47th and 52nd—in order to reinforce other units.|$|E
5|$|Her {{career is}} marked by an unusually, even spectacularly, high degree of {{interpenetration}} between her publicly available private life and her films. The star phenomenon depends upon collapsing {{the distinction between the}} star-as-person and the star-as-performer. This does not usually mean that the incidents of a film's scenario are taken to be actual incidents in the star's life but rather that they 'reveal' or express the personality of the type-of-person of the star. In the case of Turner, however, not only do her vehicles furnish characters and situations in accord with her off-screen image, but frequently incidents in them echo incidents in her life so <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> her career films like Peyton Place, Imitation of Life, Madame X and Love Has Many Faces seem in parts like mere illustrations of her life.|$|E
5|$|In August, {{plans were}} {{in place for the}} Allied forces {{to break out of the}} ANZAC foothold. Key to this was seizing the Sari Bair Range. On 7 August, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade {{commenced}} its assault on Chunuk Bair, the crest of the range, along what was known as Rhododendron Ridge. However, delays in getting the infantry battalions to their starting positions meant that the attack was launched in daylight rather than in the planned night time attack. As a result, heavy losses were incurred amongst the Auckland Infantry Battalion. Johnston, still in command of the brigade despite being clearly unfit for it, ordered Malone to take his battalion forward. Malone refused, arguing that his battalion could take Chunuk Bair that night. His refusal to advance in daylight meant <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the day, his battalion was the only intact battalion in the brigade.|$|E

5|$|In the 35 {{years between}} the time of Chandler's {{reorganization}} and the election of Wendell H. Ford as governor in 1971, the executive branch had again become unwieldy. 60 departments and 210 boards reported directly to the governor by 1972, and duplication of services between departments had created inefficiencies. On January 1, 1973, a plan that Ford had issued in late 1972 took effect, consolidating the departments reporting to him into six program cabinets: Consumer Protection and Regulation, Development, Education and the Arts, Human Resources, Safety and Justice, and Transportation. Ford continued merging departments and reorganizing the executive branch throughout 1973 to the extent <b>that,</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the year, {{there were only three}} program cabinets (Development, Education and the Arts, and Consumer Protection and Regulation) and four additional departments (Human Resources, Justice, Natural Resources and Environmental Protection, and Transportation).|$|E
5|$|Inactive in 2004–05 due to {{the players}} lockout and his ongoing suspension, which had been {{extended}} internationally, Bertuzzi returned to the Canucks in 2005–06, as the league ended his playing ban. He recorded 25 goals and 71 points, including two hat tricks (November 13, 2005, against the Detroit Red Wings and January 14, 2006, against the New York Islanders). Though he ranked third in team scoring, Crawford has recalled <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the season, Näslund and Bertuzzi had been eclipsed by Daniel and Henrik Sedin as the team's offensive leaders.|$|E
5|$|Llanelli, Ammanford and {{the upper}} parts of the Gwendraeth Valley are {{situated}} on the South Wales Coalfield. The opencast mining activities in this region have now ceased but the old mining settlements with terraced housing remain, often centred on their nonconformist chapels. Kidwelly had a tin-plating industry in the eighteenth century, with Llanelli following not long after, so <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the nineteenth century, Llanelli was the world-centre of the industry. There is little trace of these industrial activities today. Llanelli and Burry Port served at one time for the export of coal, but trade declined, as it did from the ports of Kidwelly and Carmarthen as their estuaries silted up.

500|$|Sugiyama {{has stated}} that Sasuke's line [...] "you are annoying" [...] sums up Sasuke's {{feelings}} towards Sakura.

5|$|Offa's {{diplomatic}} relations with Europe are well documented, but appear to belong only to the last dozen years of his reign. In letters dating from the late 780s or early 790s, Alcuin congratulates Offa for encouraging education and greets Offa's wife and son, Cynethryth and Ecgfrith. In about 789, or shortly before, Charlemagne proposed that his son Charles marry one of Offa's daughters, most likely Ælfflæd. Offa countered with a request that his son Ecgfrith should also marry Charlemagne's daughter Bertha: Charlemagne was outraged by the request, and broke off contact with Britain, forbidding English ships from landing in his ports. Alcuin's letters make it clear <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> 790 the dispute was still not resolved, and that Alcuin was hoping {{to be sent to}} help make peace. In the end {{diplomatic relations}} were restored, at least partly by the agency of Gervold, the abbot of St Wandrille.|$|E
5|$|The Germans responded {{quickly by}} redeploying their only reserve in the area, the 29th Panzergrenadier Division. Despite initial {{victories}} against Soviet armored forces, the Romanian collapse forced the division to again redeploy {{in an attempt}} to shore up defenses to the south. The 29th Panzergrenadier Division's counterattack had cost the Red Army around fifty tanks, and caused Soviet commanders to worry about the safety of their left flank. However, the German division's redeployment meant <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the day only the 6th Romanian Cavalry Regiment was positioned between advancing Soviet forces and the Don River.|$|E
5|$|There {{are almost}} no {{reliable}} sources {{with which to}} track the population of Scotland before the late seventeenth century. Estimates based on English records suggest <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Middle Ages, the Black Death and subsequent recurring outbreaks of the plague, may have caused the population of Scotland to fall as low as half a million people. Price inflation, which generally reflects growing demand for food, suggests that this probably expanded {{in the first half}} of the sixteenth century. Almost half the years in the second half of the sixteenth century saw local or national scarcity, necessitating the shipping of large quantities of grain from the Baltic. Distress was exacerbated by outbreaks of plague, with major epidemics in the periods 1584-8, 1595 and 1597–1609.|$|E
500|$|The film {{alternates}} between {{color and}} black and white sequences. Black and white usually denotes that the scene involves {{one or more of}} the hustlers engaged with a client, and indicates that {{one or more of the}} characters (not necessarily the client) is fantasizing. But the scheme is not always consistent: for example, when Dean has sex with the paralyzed client the scene is in color; and Harry also has an S/M scene that's all in color (although his client never appears on-screen). Equally, Harry's fantasies about [...] "Lovely Girl" [...] (who is apparently dead) are occasionally in color. In their final scene, Harry and Dean are in black and white, but when the client and Ghislaine are shown watching they're in color, raising the question of exactly who is having the fantasy. According to Lewis, the convention grew out of the fact that the initial improvised sequences were shot in black and white; he acknowledges <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>the</b> distinction had become [...] "very confused." ...|$|R

5|$|Arrangements devised in 1963 between 'Aflaq and the Military Committee {{led to a}} {{very close}} mutual {{involvement}} {{of the military and}} civilian sectors of the regime, so <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> 1965 the politics of the Syrian army had become almost identical to the politics of the Ba'th Party. The principle military protagonist of the period Hafiz, J'did, and 'Umran were no longer on military service and their power depended on their intermediary supporters in the army and in the party. In November 1965, the National Command issued a resolution which stated it was forbidden for the Regional Command to transfer or dismiss military officers without the consent of the National Command. After hearing of the resolution, Jadid rebelled immediately, and ordered Colonel Mustafa Tlas to arrest the commanders of the Homs garrison and his deputy, both supporters of National Command. In response, Razzaz called for an emergency session of the National Command which decreed the Regional Command dissolved, and made Bitar Prime Minister. Hafiz was made Chairman of a new Presidential Council and Shibli al-Aysami his deputy. Umran was recalled from exile and reappointed to the office of Minister of Defence and commander-in-chief, and Mansur al-Atrash was appointed Chairman of a new and expanded National Revolutionary Council. Jadid and his supporters responded by making war on the National Command. Assad, who neither liked nor had sympathy for the Aflaqites, did not support a showdown through the use of force. In response to the coming coup, Assad, along with Naji Jamil, Husayn Mulhim and Yusuf Sayigh, left for London.|$|E
