500|$|As Roosevelt {{became more}} active as first lady, however, she had {{less time for}} Hickok. Hickok grew angry and jealous at {{perceived}} slights, and demanded more time alone, which Roosevelt was unable to give; at other times, she attempted unsuccessfully to separate herself from Roosevelt. Though the pair remained friends throughout their lives, they continued to grow apart {{in the years that}} followed. In 1937, Roosevelt wrote to Hickok that [...] "I never meant <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>you</b> in any way, but that is no excuse having done it [...] [...] [...] I am pulling back from all my contacts now [...] [...] [...] Such cruelty & stupidity is unpardonable when you reach my age." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{his playing}} career, Bergkamp {{was accused of}} diving, and was {{referred}} to as a [...] "cheat" [...] and [...] "dirty player" [...] for retaliating against players who had previously challenged him, something his former manager Wenger denied. In an interview with The Times in 2004, he said that while he was at Inter, he realised the importance of being mentally tough in order to survive: [...] "A lot of people there try <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>you,</b> not just physically but mentally as well, and coming from the easygoing culture in Holland, I had to adopt a tougher approach. There, {{it was a case of}} two strikers up against four or five hard defenders who would stop at nothing." [...] Bergkamp says his aggression often stems from frustration.|$|E
500|$|... "Acércate" [...] {{was leaked}} onto the Internet {{prior to the}} album's release; a first in Queen's 15-year career. Originally {{entitled}} [...] "No Te Equivoques", it was re-recorded {{in response to the}} infringement and included on the album retitled [...] "Acércate". Reflecting on the situation Queen stated: [...] "Sometimes they try <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>you</b> are when you do well. I'm proud and grateful that Wisin & Yandel have gone with me to the studio to record the song. We have good chemistry and friendship. We tried to change the song and lyrics, but with their agenda, which is tight, and mine too, we could not do it again. We have no idea who hacked, all the music was in a studio and to mobilize it to another was what someone did." [...] The collaboration stemmed from Queen's previous collaboration with Wisin & Yandel on their seventh studio album La Revolución (2009) on [...] "Perfecto" [...] which also featured Yaviah.|$|E

Indeed, I would have thee, because it becomes thee to be sorry for thy sin, but do not despair of life; this great force is not <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>thee,</b> but <b>to</b> deliver thee from thy bondage, and to reduce thee to thy obedience.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Tut, tut!' said Heathcliff, {{stretching}} {{out a hand}} and dragging him roughly between his knees, and then holding up his head by the chin. 'None of that nonsense!

500|$|The lead single, [...] "La Vida es Así", was {{released}} on May 11; the music video (directed by Marlon Pena) was shot on May 17 in Miami and premiered on mun2 on June 22 and VEVO on June 28. Queen said that the genre of bachata is meaningful, since it reveals more feelings. The a cappella version of [...] "La Vida es Así" [...] was sent to Tainy and Keko Musik for production, allowing Queen to pick the version she preferred. The Keko Musik version was later released as a pre-order bonus track for Drama Queen on iTunes. The second single, [...] "Amor Puro" [...] {{was released}} for Puerto Rican radio on September 24. The music video (also directed by Marlon Pena) was shot on September 28, and premiered on VEVO November 30. The video was also filmed in Miami, at the Spanish monastery of St. Bernard of Clairvaux (a historic building dating to 1133 in Sacramenia, Segovia, Spain, later reconstructed in Miami).

2500|$|When Li Jing {{returned}} to the capital, however, the imperial censor Xiao Yu accused him of allowing his soldiers to plunder the Eastern Tujue treasury. [...] Emperor Taizong rebuked Li Jing, but still increased {{the size of his}} fief and awarded him with silk. [...] Later, regretting rebuking Li Jing, he stated to Li Jing, [...] "People have accused you <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>you.</b> [...] I realize this now. [...] Please do not mind it." [...] He awarded Li Jing with even more silk. [...] Later in 630, he made Li Jing Shangshu Pushe (尚書僕射), the head of the important executive bureau of government (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng), also a chancellor post. [...] It was said that Li Jing spoke very little when conferencing with other chancellors—then considered a virtue. [...] A more plausible explanation is that Taizong didn't trust his high officials, especially the generals, and Li Jing was very sure about it. [...] He deliberately tried to keep a low profile in order not to raise Taizong's suspicion.|$|E

6000|$|... “Huh! As if you didn’t know why!” replied Roger, with {{something}} like a chuckle. “Don’t they both know that Jessie is the very apple of your eye, and that anything that brings trouble to her will cut you to the heart?

6000|$|The Belgian {{lost his}} temper. [...] "I have no {{disposition}} {{to argue with}} a naked savage," [...] he cried. [...] "Unless <b>you</b> wish <b>to</b> be <b>hurt</b> <b>you</b> will not interfere with me. Take the prisoner, Sergeant!" ...|$|R
