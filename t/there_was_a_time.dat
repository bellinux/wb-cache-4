5|$|Hall {{slowed the}} leading pack {{down so that}} her {{teammate}} Helen Jenkins could catch-up. The lead pack joined with the peleton {{at the end of}} the second cycling lap to form a 22-women strong group. Despite the chase group chasing hard, all 22 athletes finished the cycling leg in the same pack without any additions. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> difference of one minute and 44 seconds between the 22nd and 23rd athletes after the bike leg. The quickest individual bike split was shared between two New Zealanders, Andrea Hewitt and Kate McIlroy, who both completed the bike leg in one hour, five minutes and 26 seconds. Due to overnight rain the roads were wet and multiple athletes crashed on the bike leg. Two athletes in Kathy Tremblay (Canada) and Emma Moffatt had to withdraw from the race due to crashing. Moffatt, one of the pre-race favourites crashed on the first lap of the cycling leg. At the second transition (cycling to running) Anne Haug (Germany), who was in the second group, was the quickest through the transition in a time of 27 seconds. Of the leading group most went through in around 30 seconds.|$|E

5|$|The women's triathlon {{took place}} on 4 August 2012, {{featuring}} 55 women from 31 countries. Lucy Hall (Great Britain), the youngest athlete in the race, led early in the swim and finished the swim leg first {{in a time of}} 18 minutes and 27 seconds. Hall led a group of seven; Line Jensen (Denmark), Mariko Adachi (Japan), Pâmella Oliveira (Brazil), Claudia Rivas (Mexico), Laura Bennett (United States) and Jessica Harrison (France); out of the water. In {{the early stages of the}} bike leg, Hall slowed the leading pack down so that her teammate Helen Jenkins (Great Britain) could catch-up. The lead pack joined with the peloton at the end of the second cycling lap to form a 22-women strong group. Despite the chase group chasing hard, all 22 athletes finished the cycling leg in the same pack without any additions. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> difference of one minute and 44 seconds between the 22nd and 23rd athletes after the bike leg. Due to overnight rain the roads were wet and multiple athletes crashed on the bike leg. Two athletes in Kathy Tremblay (Canada) and Emma Moffatt (Australia) had to withdraw from the race due to crashing. Moffatt, one of the pre-race favourites crashed on the first lap of the cycling leg. The lead group quickly separated on the run leg and the lead group was down to eight athletes after one lap of the running course. They were Nicola Spirig (Switzerland), Lisa Nordén (Sweden), Erin Densham (Australia), Jenkins, Sarah Groff (United States) and Andrea Hewitt (New Zealand), Ainhoa Murúa (Spain) and Emma Jackson (Australia). Jackson was the first to get dropped and was followed by Groff and Murúa. The five remaining athletes finished the second run lap together. The group was then reduced to four when Hewitt was dropped. Groff then rejoined the group at the very start of the final run lap after been dropped earlier on in the race. With 500 metres in the final lap to race Jenkins was dropped by the other four athletes. In the ensuing sprint finish between Spirig, Nordén, Densham and Groff; Spirig pushed the pace and held off a fast-finishing Nordén to win by an estimated margin of 15 centimetres. Both athletes recorded a time one hour, 59 minutes and 48 seconds, and were separated by a photo finish. Densham finished two seconds behind Spirig to win bronze. Groff finished fourth with Jenkins fifth, Hewitt sixth, Murúa seventh and Jackson eighth. After the race, Nordén and the Swedish Olympic Committee appealed against the result in the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The organisation turned down the appeal and Spirig retained the gold medal.|$|E

40|$|Ten {{studies are}} used to {{document}} that time is valued in accordance with a double-kinked value function. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> zone of indifference for small time gains (losses), increasing marginal utility (disutility) for moderate time gains (losses), and dimin-ishing marginal utility (disutility) for large time gains (losses). Moderate amounts of time exhibit increasing marginal utility (disutility) because larger blocks of <b>time</b> provide <b>a</b> more diverse set of usage opportunities. It is only when {{it is difficult to}} imagine how more (less) time would be beneficial (detrimental) that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> dimin-ishing marginal utility (disutility) for time. Thus time valuation shows increasing marginal utility when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> deficit, but diminishing marginal utility when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> surplus. These findings have implications for how other resources might be valued...|$|R

40|$|My central {{question}} {{in this paper}} is how delusional beliefs are related to self-deception. In section 1, I summa-rize my position on what self-deception is and how representative instances of it are to be explained. I turn to delusions in section 2. 1. Self-deception According to a traditional view, self-de-ception <b>is</b> <b>an</b> intrapersonal analogue of stereotypical interpersonal deception. 1 In the latter case, deceivers intentionally de-ceive others into believing something, p, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> at which the deceivers believe that p is false while their victims falsely believe that p is true. If self-decep-tion is properly understood on this model, self-deceivers intentionally deceive them-selves into believing something, p, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> at which they believe that p is false while also believing that p is true...|$|R
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> {{when this}} city had a {{circumference}} of 64 kilometres and the fort had 84 gates.

From the 7th to the 10th century, talented Jain monk/writer Acharya Haribhadra, Mundas Gani, Udayprabhsuri, Mahnedrsuri, Rajendrasuri and many more created here valuable Jain literature and sanctified and beautified this place. The temple of the 23rd Jain Tirthankar Parshvanatha in Hathi pole area is regarded to be very ancient. This temple has great archaeological importance. A golden idol of Shri Parshvanatha in Padmasana posture is the presiding deity.|$|E
25|$|Fans of chivalry {{have assumed}} {{since the late}} medieval period that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> {{in the past when}} chivalry was a living institution, when men acted chivalrically, when chivalry was alive and not dead, the {{imitation}} of which period would much improve the present. This is the mad mission of Don Quixote, protagonist of the most chivalric novel of all time and inspirer of the chivalry of Sir Walter Scott and of the U.S. South: to restore the age of chivalry, and thereby improve his country. It is a version of the myth of the Golden Age.|$|E

Another biographer describes the daily program imposed on him by Leadbeater and his associates, which included rigorous exercise and sports, tutoring in a variety of school subjects, Theosophical and religious lessons, yoga and meditation, as well as instruction in proper hygiene and in the ways of British society and culture. At the same time Leadbeater assumed the role of guide in a parallel mystical instruction of Krishnamurti; the existence and progress of this instruction was at the time known only to a select few.|$|E

25|$|As {{the best}} and {{original}} state, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when the pure elements and the two powers co-existed in a condition of rest and inertness {{in the form of}} a sphere. The elements existed together in their purity, without mixture and separation, and the uniting power of Love predominated in the sphere: the separating power of Strife guarded the extreme edges of the sphere. Since that time, strife gained more sway and the bond which kept the pure elementary substances together in the sphere was dissolved. The elements became the world of phenomena we see today, full of contrasts and oppositions, operated on by both Love and Strife. The sphere being the embodiment of pure existence is the embodiment or representative of God. Empedocles assumed a cyclical universe whereby the elements return and prepare the formation of the sphere for the next period of the universe.|$|E
