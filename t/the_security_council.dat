5|$|Negotiations over <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> {{resolution}} {{were initially}} contentious, as the U.S., the UK, and France submitted a draft resolution that included automatic invocation of Chapter VII, sanctioning {{use of military}} force if Syria did not fulfill its commitments under the agreement. Russia and China were opposed to any resolution that authorized enforcement under Chapter VII without a second vote of <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council.</b> After further negotiations, on 26 September the five permanent members of the UN Security Council reached agreement on an implementation and enforcement draft resolution. On the following day, just hours after the OPCW Executive Council approved a detailed implementation plan for the U.S./Russian Framework, Security Council Resolution 2118 was unanimously passed, making the OPCW plan binding on the Syrians.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> {{is made up}} {{of fifteen}} member states, {{consisting}} of five permanent members—China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States—and ten non-permanent members elected for two-year terms by the General Assembly (with end of term date)—Bolivia (term ends 2018), Egypt (2017), Ethiopia (2018), Italy (2018), Japan (2017), Kazakhstan (2018), Senegal (2017), Sweden (2018), Ukraine (2017), Uruguay (2017). The five permanent members hold veto power over UN resolutions, allowing a permanent member to block adoption of a resolution, though not debate. The ten temporary seats are held for two-year terms, with five member states per year voted in by the General Assembly on a regional basis.

5|$|As the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Belarusian Armed Forces, the President has {{the duty}} to protect the Belarusian {{territory}} from internal and external forces. The president can call for {{a state of emergency}} in the following cases: natural disasters, a catastrophe, or unrest involving violence or the threat of violence. Regardless if the declaration affects the entire country or sections of it, the Council of the Republic must be notified by the President and must seek their approval within three days of notification. The same rules applies if the President issues a state of martial law {{in the event of a}} possible military action against Belarus. The President has to form and head <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> of the Republic of Belarus, and can appoint and dismiss the State Secretary of <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> and the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{no country}} in Africa has a {{permanent}} seat on <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council.</b> Although no one nation from Africa has formally been put forward {{as a candidate}} for membership on <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council,</b> Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, South Africa, and Nigeria are seen as the strongest choices. Algeria has gained {{a great deal of respect}} for its neutrality over the years and its great commitment to African development; Egypt has the second-largest economy in Africa and the biggest military on the continent, was one of the founding members of the United Nations, enjoys great influence in Africa and in the Arab world, and hosts the headquarters of the Arab League; Ethiopia was also one of the founding members of the United Nations and holds the seat of the African Union Commission; South Africa has the third-largest economy on the continent; and Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, has the continent's largest economy, and is one of the largest contributors of military and civilian personnel to UN peacekeeping missions.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the leading}} {{candidates}} for permanent membership are regularly elected onto <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> by their respective groups: Japan was elected for eleven two-year terms, Brazil for ten terms, and Germany for three terms.

50|$|On February 23, 2009, the Obama {{administration}} released Presidential Study Directive 1.

5|$|The UN {{system is}} based on five {{principal}} organs: the General Assembly, <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council,</b> the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), the Secretariat, and the International Court of Justice.

5|$|The first {{meetings}} of the General Assembly, with 51 nations represented, and <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> took place in London beginning 10 January 1946.

5|$|Amending the UN Charter, {{possibly}} {{through a}} Charter Review Conference under Article 109 of the UN Charter, is a commonly cited possibility. This {{is difficult because}} it requires ratification by two-thirds of UN members, including all five permanent members of <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council.</b> There have been only five amendments to the UN Charter since 1945, {{and none of them}} were done through the Article 109 process. Louis Sohn and Grenville Clark, in their 1958 book World Peace Through World Law, proposed establishing a UN Parliamentary Assembly through this method.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the actual}} and outer {{structures}} {{that make up}} and surround the United Nations Headquarters are the inner groups that play a role as well. <b>The</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> containing 5 permanent and 10 temporary {{for a total of}} 15 members, ensures the stabilization of peace and security whether in terms of threats or simple adjustments. A heavier focus on actual activities like debating in policymaking, and reflecting {{in and out of the}} environment, is conducted by the Economic and Social Council.|$|E
