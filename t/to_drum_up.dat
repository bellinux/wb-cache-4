5|$|Liverpool Women's Suffrage Society {{was formed}} with the {{intention}} of fulfilling a number of goals. It hoped to educate women on why they {{should have the right to}} vote and convince men of the same. It had links with Liberal MPs and intended to use these to pressure the government to allow women's suffrage. In addition, the society tried <b>to</b> <b>drum</b> <b>up</b> support for their cause by holding small scale events, often with speakers at the Yamen Cafe in Liverpool's Bond Street. The events would also include poetry, singing or performances of acting or ballet by the Blue Bird Theatre Company.|$|E

He spent most of the year in Wales, preaching the crusade, accompanied by the chronicler Gerald of Wales. Gerald claimed about 3000 recruits for the crusade from his and Baldwin's efforts in Wales, although he also suggested that Baldwin mainly embarked on the tour to avoid his dispute with the Canterbury monks.|$|E

25|$|Shinwell did not resume ministerial {{office when}} Labour {{returned}} {{to power in}} October 1964, but instead the new Prime Minister Harold Wilson appointed him Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, and during the 1964-6 Parliament he worked hard <b>to</b> <b>drum</b> <b>up</b> backbench support for the government, which had a very narrow majority.

25|$|The {{confusion}} over {{the origins of}} the name led over the years to variant spellings such as Kaatskill and Kaaterskill, both of which are also still used: the former in the regional magazine Kaatskill Life, the latter as the name of a mountain peak and a waterfall. The supposed Indian name for the range, Onteora ("land in the sky"), was actually created by a white man in the mid-19th century <b>to</b> <b>drum</b> <b>up</b> business for a resort. It, too, persists today as the name of a school district and as the name of a Boy Scout summer camp (Onteora Scout Reservation).|$|E
25|$|The Yak-16-II {{passed its}} manufacturer's trials in April 1948 and was {{submitted}} for the State acceptance trials shortly afterwards. These revealed several deficiencies {{that caused the}} horizontal tail area to be increased and deicing equipment to be fitted on the leading edges of the wings and tail. It was resubmitted for another round of State acceptance trials which approved it for production. However, it was not selected for production as the Antonov An-2 {{was thought to be}} more versatile in both roles. Some effort was made <b>to</b> <b>drum</b> <b>up</b> export sales in Eastern Europe, but no interest was shown because it was not in service with Aeroflot. The prototypes were used for a time by the Yakovlev OKB and Factory No. 464 which had built them.|$|E

Two conferences, one in Dakar and another in Freetown were organised in 1963. Their aim was to throw into open debate the place of African literature in the university curriculum. They wanted <b>to</b> <b>drum</b> support <b>up</b> for the inclusion of African literature as a substantive area of study at university, where traditionally it was being pushed into extramural departments and institutes of African Studies. Mphahlele had only planned to stay in Paris for two years, after which he would return to teaching. Those experiences had made him yearn for the classroom again ...|$|R

25|$|UMWA {{support for}} the strike, however, {{was not nearly as}} strong. International union {{president}} Thomas Lewis had not condoned the strike, and criticized efforts by leaders in surrounding UMWA Districts <b>to</b> <b>drum</b> <b>up</b> increased {{support for the}} strikers. But in March 1910, a special meeting of the UMWA international executive board voted to support the strike, forcing Lewis to grudgingly offer the union's resources. Eventually, the union gave more than $1 million in relief payments to the strikers. Lewis, however, continued to work to undermine the union's support for the strike. He backed an insurgent faction in District 6 to unseat leaders who supported the strike. The act led to internecine warfare in the union and charges that Lewis and his candidates were in league with mine owners.|$|E
