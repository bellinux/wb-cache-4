5|$|The final island {{platform}} is shorter and only has east-end platforms 13 and 15: 15 {{is used by}} most trains from Paddington that continue westwards to Weston-super-Mare or beyond. Platform 13 is a terminus platform and is used by many trains from Paddington, some local services and occasionally by CrossCountry. There is another siding beyond platform 15 {{that used to be}} the In/Out Road for Bath Road Traction Maintenance Depot. This depot has been demolished. Between platforms 3/4 and 5/6 are the Up <b>Through</b> <b>line</b> and the Middle Siding, the latter is often used to stable Mark 1 carriages between Torbay Express duties in the summer months. The Down <b>Through</b> <b>line</b> runs between platforms 11/12 and 13.|$|E

50|$|The {{station was}} opened on 2 April 1906 {{as part of}} the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway. The station layout was four tracks, with two <b>through</b> <b>lines</b> and two {{platform}} lines. British Rail removed the <b>through</b> <b>lines</b> early in 1974.As part of Chiltern Railways' Project Evergreen 2 the platform lines were upgraded to increase the <b>line</b> speed for <b>through</b> trains from 40 mph to 75 mph.|$|R

5|$|However, as {{transshipment}} costs increased, and unprocessed bulk cargos {{decreased in}} volume, {{the economics of}} road transport resulted in a gradual dwindling of traffic on the MSC Railway system, and hence contraction in the MSC Railway itself. Traffic reduction was added to by: the 1969 closure of the CWS Irlam soap works; post nationalisation British Steel Corporation building their own line to Glazebrook to junction with BR; and severe reductions in traffic of ICI's soda ash trains, British Tar Products and reduced domestic coal consumption. With the remaining engines stationed at Ellesmere Port and Stanlow, maintenance {{on the line from}} Irlam through to Partington was halted in late summer 1977, and all through traffic except engineering trains stopped on 21 December 1977. The <b>through</b> <b>line</b> was officially closed to all traffic in 1978, but many of the sidings complexes remained; the last operational section of the MSC Railway, at Trafford Park, closed on 30 April 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{current line}} scheme of the R1 started {{operating}} on , after {{the dismantling of}} the former route of the Barcelona–Mataró–Maçanet-Massanes railway through the Barcelona neighborhood of Poblenou. Earlier, all the commuter rail services coming from Mataró used the route through Poblenou, terminating at Estació de les Rodalies, a terminus station that was located adjacent to the still existing Estació de França. All services coming from Mataró were then rerouted through the Sagrera rail complex and the Meridiana Tunnel to access Barcelona, terminating at L'Hospitalet de Llobregat or Barcelona–El Prat Airport stations, depending on the station of origin. The services coming from Mataró terminated at the airport, whilst the services coming from north of Mataró terminated at L'Hospitalet de Llobregat. Since the new <b>through</b> <b>line</b> scheme offered more stops within Barcelona and better connections with the city's metro system, the line's ridership doubled. Throughout 1989, this new line scheme was incorporated as part of line 1 of Rodalies Barcelona (predecessor of the R1), the Cercanías commuter rail system for the Barcelona area, created in the same year.|$|E
5|$|Wood Siding {{initially}} had no {{facilities for}} passengers, {{not even a}} platform. In 1894 a low platform and small corrugated iron waiting room were built for passengers. As well as the passenger platform, a short siding led to a raised wooden platform, alongside the <b>through</b> <b>line</b> to Brill, which served both as a buffer stop for the siding, and as a loading platform for milk. The station was staffed by a single porter, responsible for opening the gates of a nearby level crossing and for loading and unloading freight (mainly milk); a small, unheated hut was provided for his use. While the original Aveling & Porter locomotive was slow and noisy and could be heard by the porter long before its arrival, later locomotives were quieter and quicker; a ladder was installed against a large oak for the porter to watch for oncoming trains. Wood Siding station and its siding were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908–1910 to stand on a wide bridge above the new Chiltern Main Line. Wood Siding {{was removed from the}} timetable by 1931, although trains continued to stop on request. While Wood Siding station was demolished shortly after closure, the abutments of the bridge which carried the station and sidings remain intact. The porter's hut survives as a nearby garden shed.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1881 the New York, Westchester and Putnam Railway was completed, running {{north and}} east from New York City to the NY at Brewster. This company had been {{previously}} involved with the BH in building a <b>through</b> <b>line</b> between New York and Boston, even being called the New York and Boston Railroad at first, and with its opening such a <b>through</b> <b>line</b> was formed. For some time such a traffic arrangement was made, lasting through the NYW's absorption into the New York Central Railroad in 1894.|$|E
25|$|By July 1897 it was {{apparent}} that the decision not to include platforms on both Through lines was causing some operational difficulty. To address this a new platform serving the Up <b>Through</b> <b>line</b> was opened in 1900.|$|E

25|$|The Scottish Midland Junction Railway {{opened in}} 1848 from Perth to Forfar, giving onward access to Aberdeen. The SMJR and the Aberdeen Railway amalgamated in 1856 {{to form the}} Scottish North Eastern Railway in 1856. The SNER did not remain {{independent}} for long: it was absorbed by the Caledonian in 1866. At {{the time of the}} absorption the SNER and the Great North of Scotland Railway were engaged in building a <b>through</b> <b>line</b> at Aberdeen, with a new Joint station; it opened in 1867.|$|E
5000|$|The Brühl {{railway station}} {{is a minor}} station on the double-tracked West Rhine railway line. At {{the time of the}} {{accident}} it had two passing sidings, one {{on each side of the}} <b>through</b> <b>lines.</b> The station is equipped for limited bi-directional running: the passing sidings had exit signals on both ends while the <b>through</b> <b>lines</b> had exit signals only for the main direction. A train passing the station on the [...] "wrong" [...] line therefore had to use the passing siding rather than the main running line unless a specific written order was issued.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Blechynden {{station was}} replaced by a new station, called Southampton West (sometimes Southampton West End), a short distance to the west, in July 1858. The station had two <b>through</b> <b>lines,</b> and it was extended on 1 November 1892. It was much extended again with the provision of four <b>through</b> <b>lines</b> opening as Southampton Central on 7 July 1935, and the line was quadrupled from the station to Millbrook. The suffix Central was dropped from 10 July 1967, but was reinstated on 29 May 1994: the name is now Southampton Central.|$|R

25|$|The Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad was {{chartered}} in Ohio on February 24 and in Pennsylvania on April 11, 1848, {{to build}} from Allegheny City (annexed by Pittsburgh in 1907) west to Crestline, Ohio, on the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad. It was organized on June 15, and construction began on July 4, 1849. The first section, from Allegheny City west to New Brighton, opened July 30, 1851. Extensions opened to New Galilee on October 22 and Enon Valley November 19. On November 27, 1851, a section between Salem and Alliance, Ohio, was completed, not yet {{connected to the}} rest. On December 8, the east section was extended west to East Palestine, Ohio, with a stagecoach transfer provided for through travel. Further sections opened January 3, 1852, west to Columbiana, and on January 6 the gap between Columbiana and Salem was filled. In conjunction with the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad, connecting at Alliance, a <b>through</b> <b>line</b> was provided between Cleveland and Pittsburgh. On March 11, 1852, an extension west to Massillon was opened with an excursion. On August 10, 1852, a further extension from Massillon west to Wooster opened. The line west to Mansfield was finished April 8, 1853, and the full line to Crestline opened April 11. With this it formed part of a <b>through</b> <b>line</b> to Cincinnati via the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad.|$|E
25|$|Goods yards were at Grange Hill (closed 1965), Hainault (closed 1908), Fairlop (closed 1958), Barkingside and Newbury Park (both closed 1965). One of {{the former}} sidings at Newbury Park is now the {{eastbound}} <b>through</b> <b>line,</b> with the former eastbound line normally used only for reversing, though it retains the connection facing Barkingside. The sidings at Grange Hill now form part of the north-facing access from Hainault Depot. They extend parallel to the station platforms, {{and there are also}} sidings {{at the southern end of}} the depot next to the platforms at Hainault. East of Chigwell a short siding served Chigwell Nursery in GER days, but this was closed, probably before Grouping into the LNER (the nursery was sold in 1922).|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, in Lincolnshire, the new Spalding to Lincoln {{direct line}} opened from Spalding via Sleaford to Ruskington on 6 March 1882 {{and on the}} Lincoln on 1 August, on which date the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway came into being {{comprising}} {{in addition to the}} new Spalding– Lincoln line, the former GNR March to Spalding and Lincoln to Doncaster lines and the former GER Huntingdon to March line plus the Ramsey branch from Somersham. To the GER this was the line to the Yorkshire coal fields they had long been seeking, to the GNR it provided a new alternative line for freight from Huntingdon to Doncaster to relieve pressure on the main line. In the first five months of the joint line, the GNR lost £50,000 due to diverted traffic, but according to Lord Colville, chairman of the GNR, it was better to have half the receipts of a joint line than to have to compete with a new entirely foreign <b>through</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
25|$|The train shed {{was removed}} in 1912-13 and the {{platforms}} extended northwards towards the level crossing. A second island platform was provided {{on the west}} side and this entailed the goods sheds being narrowed from two tracks to one at their southern end. The middle island platform was mainly used for LSWR trains while down GWR services used the original main platform and the new island platforms. Before Southern Region services to Plymouth were abandoned, passengers could see Plymouth-bound services of the Western Region and Southern Region leaving St Davids in opposite directions. The station has remained largely in this form since, but resignalling in the 1985 saw the ex-LSWR services moved to the main platform so that down ex-GWR line services did not have to cross their path {{at the south end of}} the station. A <b>through</b> <b>line</b> between platforms 1 and 3 was removed at the same time. The new signal box was built on the site of the old atmospheric engine house and replaced three older signal boxes.|$|E
