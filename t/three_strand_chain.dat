50|$|Gelatin {{consists}} of partially hydrolyzed collagen, a protein which is highly abundant in animal tissues such as bone and skin. Collagen is a protein {{made up of}} <b>three</b> <b>strands</b> of polypeptide <b>chains</b> that form in a helical structure. To make a gelatin dessert, such as Jello, the collagen is mixed with water and heated, disrupting the bonds that hold the <b>three</b> <b>strands</b> of polypeptides together. As the gelatin cools, these bonds try to reform in the same structure as before, but now with small bubbles of liquid in between. This gives gelatin its semisolid, gel-like texture.|$|R
40|$|The recA protein from Escherichia coli can homolo-gously align two duplex DNA molecules; however, this {{interaction}} {{is much less}} efficient than the alignment of a single strand and a duplex. <b>Three</b> <b>strand</b> paranemic joints are readily detected. In contrast, duplex-duplex pairing is detected only when the incoming (second) duplex is negatively supercoiled, and even here the pairing is inefficient. The recA protein-promoted four strand exchange reaction is initiated in a <b>three</b> <b>strand</b> region, with efficiency increasing with the length of potential <b>three</b> <b>strand</b> pairing available for initiation. This indicates that a paranemic joint involving <b>three</b> DNA <b>strands</b> {{may be an important}} intermediate in all recA protein-mediated DNA strand exchange reactions and that the presence of <b>three</b> <b>strands</b> rather than fou...|$|R

40|$|We compare {{results of}} {{previous}} simulations {{of a simple}} model of DNA denaturation to the predictions of the Poland-Scheraga model. Concentrating on the critical region of the latter model we calculate both thermodynamic quantities and the distribution functions measured in the simulations. We find that the Poland-Scheraga model yields {{an excellent fit to}} the data, provided (i) we include a (singular) factor weighting the open ends of the doubly <b>stranded</b> <b>chain,</b> and (ii) we keep the leading corrections to the finite size scaling limit. The exponent c_ 1, which governs the end-weighting factor, is fairly well determined: 0. 1 <~ c_ 1 <~ 0. 15. The exponent c, which governs the length distribution of large loops, is determined only poorly. The data are compatible with values of c in at least the range 1. 9 <~ c <~ 2. 2. From the data it therefore cannot be decided whether the denaturation transition asymptotically is of first or of second order. We suggest that simulations of doubly <b>stranded</b> <b>chains</b> closed at both ends might allow for a more precise determination of c...|$|R

40|$|Braids can be {{represented}} geometrically as curve diagrams. The geometric complexity of a braid is the minimal complexity of a curve diagram representing it. We introduce and study the corresponding notion of geometric generating function. We compute explicitly the geometric generating function for the group of braids on <b>three</b> <b>strands</b> and prove that it is neither rational nor algebraic, nor even holonomic. This result may appear as counterintuitive. Indeed, the standard complexity (due to the Artin presentation of braid groups) is algorithmically harder to compute than the geometric complexity, yet the associated generating function for the group of braids on <b>three</b> <b>strands</b> is rational.
