5|$|A {{danger to}} {{agriculture}} is wheat rust, a pathogenic fungus causing reddish patches, coloured by its spores. A virulent {{form of the}} wheat disease, stem rust, strain Ug99, spread from Africa across to the Arabian Peninsula by 2007. In field trials in Kenya, more than 85% of wheat samples, including major cultivars, were susceptible, implying <b>that</b> <b>higher</b> crop diversity was required. The Nobel laureate Norman Borlaug argued for action to ensure global food security.|$|E

5|$|Across the {{southern}} {{portion of the}} Baja California peninsula, the storm dropped moderate rainfall, {{with a total of}} about 5inches (125mm) reported in Cabo San Lucas; the NHC remarked <b>that</b> <b>higher</b> amounts likely occurred in higher elevations. The rainfall caused minor flooding in and around Cabo San Lucas. Along {{the southern}} coast of the peninsula, Emilia produced tropical storm force winds; two stations reported sustained winds of 43mph (69km/h), with one of those reporting wind gusts to 55mph (89km/h). The storm caused minor damage to buildings and utility lines. Waves from the storm left minor damage at several marinas in the region, with several being closed for two days.|$|E

5|$|Although the 1st Marine Division {{landed at}} Wonsan {{as part of}} Almond's US X Corps, Almond and Major General Oliver P. Smith of the 1st Marine Division shared a mutual loathing of each other that dated back to a meeting before the landing at Inchon, when Almond had spoken of how easy amphibious {{landings}} are {{even though he had}} never been involved in one. Smith believed there were large numbers of Chinese forces in North Korea despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>higher</b> headquarters in Tokyo said otherwise, but Almond felt Smith was overly cautious. The mutual distrust between the commanders caused Smith to slow the 1st Marine Division's advance towards the Chosin Reservoir in violation of Almond's instructions. Smith established supply points and airfields along the way at Hagaru-ri and Koto-ri.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's {{interest}} on the biology of reef organisms was focussed on aspects related to his geological idea of subsidence; in particular, {{he was looking for}} confirmation that the reef building organisms could only live at shallow depths. FitzRoy's soundings at the Keeling Islands gave a depth limit for live coral of about 20fathoms (37m), and taking into account numerous observations by others, Darwin worked with a probable limit of 30fathoms (55m). Modern findings suggest a limit of around 100m, still {{a small fraction of the}} depth of the ocean floor at 3000–5000m. Darwin recognised the importance of red algae, and he reviewed other organisms that could have helped to build the reefs. He thought they lived at similarly shallow depths, but banks formed at greater depths were found in the 1880s. Darwin reviewed the distribution of different species of coral across a reef. He thought that the seaward reefs most exposed to wind and waves were formed by massive corals and red algae; this would be the most active area of reef growth and so would cause a tendency for reefs to grow outwards once they reach sea level. He believed <b>that</b> <b>higher</b> temperatures and the calmer water of the lagoons favoured the greatest coral diversity. These ecological ideas are still current, and research on the details continues.|$|E
