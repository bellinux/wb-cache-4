5|$|For the Internet, the {{physical}} medium and {{data link protocol}} can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This is because the Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used. This leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.|$|E
5|$|High {{amounts of}} {{ionizing}} radiation exposure {{can increase the}} risk of AML. Survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had an increased rate of AML, as did radiologists exposed to high levels of X-rays prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> modern radiation safety practices. People treated with ionizing radiation after treatment for prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer, and breast cancer have the highest chance of acquiring AML, but this increased risk returns to the background risk observed in the general population after 12 years.|$|E
5|$|In some European Celtic or Germanic {{countries}} prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> Christianity, {{the ruler}} upon his election was {{raised on a}} shield and, while standing upon it, was borne {{on the shoulders of}} several chief men of the nation (or tribe) in a procession around his assembled subjects. This was usually performed three times. Following this, the king was given a spear, and a diadem wrought of silk or linen (not to be confused with a crown) was bound around his forehead as a token of regal authority.|$|E

5|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> {{the current}} state flag of West Virginia, the state had been {{represented}} {{by a number of}} flags since attaining statehood in 1863, all of which proved impractical. The first West Virginia Legislature commissioned Joseph H. Diss Debar of Doddridge County to design the Great Seal of West Virginia in 1863. On September 26, 1863, the West Virginia Legislature officially adopted the seal designed by Diss Debar, a stylized version of which was also designated the state's coat of arms. Despite the adoption of an official seal, the state did not decide upon an official state flag until 1905.|$|E
5|$|The Canopus-class {{ships were}} {{powered by a}} pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines, with steam {{provided}} by twenty Belleville boilers. They were the first British battleships with water-tube boilers, which generated more power at less expense in weight compared with the fire-tube boilers used in previous ships. The new boilers led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> fore-and-aft funnels, rather than the side-by-side funnel arrangement used in many previous British battleships. The Canopus-class ships proved to be good steamers, with a high speed for battleships of their time— from —a full two knots faster than the Majestics.|$|E
5|$|The Superliner I cars stored {{waste in}} onboard {{retention}} tanks, but then macerated and dumped {{it along the}} tracks once the train had attained a preset speed. This was an improvement on the Hi-Levels, which dumped directly to the tracks. Growing public concern about such dumping led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> a full-retention system in the Superliner IIs. They were the first long-distance cars with such a system. The Superliner I cars were retrofitted with a full-retention system in the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|The late 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries saw Americans leaving the Eastern Seaboard to settle further inland. One {{of the results}} was that the PCUSA signed a Plan of Union with the Congregationalists of New England in 1801, which formalized {{cooperation}} between the two bodies and attempted to provide adequate visitation and preaching for frontier congregations, along with eliminating rivalry between the two denominations. The large growth rate of the Presbyterian Church in the Northeast was in part due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> Congregationalist settlers along the western frontier.|$|E
5|$|The {{techniques}} and technologies to deliver supplies by air {{were in their}} infancy. There were few aircraft available, and these were {{of a variety of}} different types, complicating maintenance. Air operations in New Guinea were restricted by the weather. Transport aircraft were vulnerable in the air, and required fighter escorts. They were also subject to destruction on the ground by Japanese air raids. The loss of the airstrip at Kokoda led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> air dropping. Due to a shortage of parachutes, supplies often had to be dropped without them, and loss due to breakages and unrecoverable goods was high.|$|E
5|$|A {{potential}} obstacle <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> biological {{pest control}} measures is growers {{sticking to the}} familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides {{have a variety of}} undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the spar, the thick-skinned {{leading edge}} of the wing formed a strong and rigid D-shaped box, which took most of the wing loads. At the time the wing was designed, this D-shaped leading edge was {{intended}} to house steam condensers for the evaporative cooling system intended for the PV-XII. Constant problems with the evaporative system in the Goshawk led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> a cooling system which used 100% glycol. The radiators were housed in a new radiator-duct designed by Fredrick Meredith of the RAE at Farnborough. This used the cooling air to generate thrust, greatly reducing the net drag produced by the radiators. In turn, the leading-edge structure lost its function as a condenser, but it was later adapted to house integral fuel tanks of various sizes – a feature patented by Vickers-Supermarine in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Deployed in India, Nolan was {{eventually}} made the regimental riding master and an aide-de-camp to General George Berkeley, commander-in-chief in Madras, accompanying him on horse trials {{to evaluate the}} use of geldings as cavalry mounts rather than stallions, and was made a Captain in 1850. Returning to Great Britain in 1851, he toured continental Europe and wrote two books on horsemanship and cavalry theory, the second of which, Cavalry: Its History and Tactics, was universally acclaimed and led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> a Nolan-designed saddle by the British Army. A trusted voice on cavalry matters, Nolan was dispatched to the Middle East {{in the early days of}} the Crimean War to hunt for appropriate mounts. After returning he was attached to the staff of General Richard Airey, and in this role delivered the order that led to the Charge of the Light Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Experience with {{previous}} battlecruiser designs led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> a continuous upper deck, which raised {{the level of}} the deck aft. This was necessary because the aft decks of earlier designs were usually awash when steaming at high speed, even in calm seas. The ships were also equipped with a bulbous bow to reduce drag on the hull, the first time the feature was used in the German Navy. The ships as designed required a crew of 46 officers and 1,140 enlisted sailors. Service as a squadron flagship would increase that number by an additional 14 officers and 62 sailors. The vessels carried a number of small boats, including two picket boats, one barge, two launches, two cutters, and three yawls.|$|E
