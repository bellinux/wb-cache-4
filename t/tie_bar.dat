40|$|AbstractConcrete-filled-steel-tube (CFST) columns {{have been}} adopted due to its {{superior}} strength and ductility performance contributed by the composite action. However, this beneficial composite action cannot be fully developed at early elastic stage as steel dilates more than concrete and thereby causing imperfect interface bonding.

To resolve the problem, confinement {{in the form of}} <b>tie</b> <b>bars</b> is proposed in this study to restrict the lateral dilation of concrete and steel at initial elastic stage. In this paper, CFST columns of various dimensions, concrete strength and installed with <b>tie</b> <b>bars</b> were tested under uni-axial compression. From the results, it was evident that: (1) <b>Tie</b> <b>bars</b> could increase the axial load-carrying capacity (Maximum 16 %; average, 5 %) and decrease the strength degradation rate of CFST columns. (2) <b>Tie</b> <b>bars</b> were not effective in improving the elastic stiffness of CFST columns.

40|$|Concrete-filled-steel-tube (CFST) columns {{have been}} widely adopted for column {{construction}} of tall buildings due to its superior strength and ductility performance contributed by the composite action. However, this beneficial composite action cannot be fully developed at early elastic stage as steel dilates more than concrete and thereby causing imperfect interface bonding, which reduces the elastic strength and stiffness. To resolve the problem, confinement {{in the form of}} <b>tie</b> <b>bars</b> is proposed in this study to restrict the elastic lateral dilation of concrete. For verification, 30 CFST columns of various dimensions cast with normal- (NSC) or high-strength concrete (HSC) and installed with <b>tie</b> <b>bars</b> were tested under uni-axial compression in this study. From the results, it was evident that: (1) tie-confined CFST columns had uni-axial strength larger than those of unconfined CFST columns. (2) <b>Tie</b> <b>bars</b> can increase slightly the elastic stiffness of the CFST columns. (3) <b>Tie</b> <b>bars</b> can restrict effectively the lateral dilation of CFST columns. (4) The failure modes of tie-confined NSCFST and HSCFST columns were the local buckling at the ends and formation of longitudinal steel cracks initiated at bolt holes. Lastly, based on the test results, analytical model taking into account the confining effects of steel tube have been developed to predict the uni-axial strength of tie-confined CFST columns...|$|R

The lower <b>tie</b> <b>bar</b> is designed to reduce the non-pivoting movement of the control arms and to stiffen the subframe to lessen the distortion of the lower suspension, especially during hard cornering.
