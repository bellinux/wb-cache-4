500|$|Repairs of the {{earthquake}} damage began in 1908, despite misgivings from some university administration regarding its cost. The church and the Old Chemistry building {{were the only two}} buildings in the university's Inner Quad that were repaired. [...] The extent of the damage was such that the church had to be completely rebuilt. The entire church, except for its surviving crossing structure and offices, was dismantled stone by stone, which, along with the windows, were labelled and stored. [...] "To assure permanence" [...] in case of further earthquakes, the masonry was anchored to its thick, concrete-reinforced walls. [...] The stones were securely bolted to each other, [...] "making the whole structure practically one massive hollow rock on a great steel foundation skeleton". [...] <b>The</b> <b>tile</b> <b>floor</b> was replaced with cork. [...] The building's crossing received a tiled hipped roof and an oculus, which lit the interior of the church, and was added above the renovated dome, which had a frescoed ceiling decorated with bronze designs as opposed to the gold leaf present before {{the earthquake}}. [...] The original rose window above the front facade was replaced with one with a simpler arch shape because it was more similar to the style {{of the rest of the}} buildings in the Inner Quad.|$|E

50|$|In 1922, the new London Central Collegiate Institute {{was officially}} opened. It was {{enlarged}} in 1962 {{and again in}} 1968. Central celebrated its centennial in 1977. Construction of an addition including new weight room, elevator and conference room was completed in August 1993. Further extensive renovations took place during 1995-1996 which fully modernized Central’s building, made it mostly wheelchair accessible, and incorporated a school-wide computer network for students. The school's gym has recently been renovated, replacing <b>the</b> original <b>tile</b> <b>flooring</b> with hardwood. Instead of just taking out the old floor and putting the new one in, the school ran into a dilemma. <b>The</b> old <b>tile</b> <b>flooring</b> was literally <b>the</b> ceiling for the basement. So instead, they placed the new wood <b>flooring</b> over <b>the</b> old <b>tile</b> <b>flooring</b> making it {{look as if they}} did in fact remove <b>the</b> <b>tiles.</b> Once <b>the</b> school found out they were putting the new floor over the old, students and teachers came into the gym at random times throughout the day, and drew messages to a late student, Alex Vlach, who had died from cancer earlier in the year.|$|R

All the blinds were down, and <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> <b>floor</b> had been {{recently}} sprinkled with water; her eyes were half shut, but she affected to be reading a novel as they entered. Though she was a bustling woman, she enjoyed repose between-whiles and had a remarkable appetite for sleep.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile I gained {{rapidly in}} health. The residencia {{stood on the}} crown of a stony plateau; on every side the {{mountains}} hemmed it about; only from the roof, where was a bartizan, there might be seen between two peaks, a small segment of plain, blue with extreme distance. The air in these altitudes moved freely and largely; great clouds congregated there, and were broken up by the wind and left in tatters on the hilltops; a hoarse, and yet faint rumbling of torrents rose from all round; and one could there study all the ruder and more ancient characters of nature in something of their pristine force. I delighted from {{the first in the}} vigorous scenery and changeful weather; nor less in the antique and dilapidated mansion where I dwelt. This was a large oblong, flanked at two opposite corners by bastion-like projections, one of which commanded the door, while both were loopholed for musketry. The lower storey was, besides, naked of windows, so that the building, if garrisoned, could not be carried without artillery. It enclosed an open court planted with pomegranate trees. From this a broad flight of marble stairs ascended to an open gallery, running all round and resting, towards the court, on slender pillars. Thence again, several enclosed stairs led to the upper storeys of the house, which were thus broken up into distinct divisions. The windows, both within and without, were closely shuttered; some of the stone-work in the upper parts had fallen; the roof, in one place, had been wrecked in one of the flurries of wind which were common in these mountains; and the whole house, in the strong, beating sunlight, and standing out above a grove of stunted cork-trees, thickly laden and discoloured with dust, looked like the sleeping palace of the legend. The court, in particular, seemed the very home of slumber. A hoarse cooing of doves haunted about the eaves; the winds were excluded, but when they blew outside, the mountain dust fell here as thick as rain, and veiled the red bloom of the pomegranates; shuttered windows and the closed doors of numerous cellars, and the vacant, arches of the gallery, enclosed it; and all day long the sun made broken profiles on the four sides, and paraded the shadow of the pillars on the gallery floor. At the ground level there was, however, a certain pillared recess, which bore the marks of human habitation. Though it was open in front upon the court, it was yet provided with a chimney, where a wood fire would he always prettily blazing; and <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> <b>floor</b> was littered with the skins of animals.|$|E

Paint peels off the ceilings in most hallways and classrooms, and the building feels old.

[...] When they realized Riley Ann was dead, Trenor and Zeigler went to Walmart to buy a Sterilite plastic storage container.
