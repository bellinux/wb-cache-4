25|$|The Cherokee {{language}} {{remains an}} integral part of the Cherokee history and cultural identity, and both dialects of the Cherokee language have been tenaciously preserved. Cherokee has been the co-official language of the Cherokee Nation alongside English since a 1991 legislation proclaimed this under the Act Relating to the Tribal Policy for the Promotion and Preservation of Cherokee Language, History, and Culture. Cherokee is also recognized as the official language of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians. As Cherokee is official, the entire constitution of the United Keetoowah Band is available in both English and Cherokee. As an official language, any tribal member may communicate with the tribal government in Cherokee or English, English <b>translation</b> <b>services</b> are provided for Cherokee speakers, and both Cherokee and English are used when the tribe provides services, resources, and information to tribal members or when communicating with the tribal council. By sanctioning the Cherokee language, the 1991 legislation allows the political branch of the nation to maintain Cherokee as a living language. Because they are within the Cherokee Nation tribal jurisdiction area, hospitals and health centers such as the Three Rivers Health Center in Muscogee, Oklahoma provide Cherokee language <b>translation</b> <b>services.</b> The Cherokee Nation sponsors a language preservation project, offering online classes for Cherokee language levels I, II, and III. Participants can test their knowledge of the language online at the Cherokee Learning Center, also sponsored by the Cherokee Nation. Classes for adults who do not yet speak the language are offered in many locations. On the national level, the federal election voter guide is now available in the four most commonly spoken Native American/Alaska Native languages, of which Cherokee is one.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} is to {{describe}} quality assurance mechanisms at the <b>Translation</b> <b>Service</b> of the General Secretariat of the Council of the EU (GSC). The first part will put the GSC's translation activity into a more general framework of {{the workings of the}} whole institution. Furthermore, the GSC's approach to translation quality will be explained, and tools and procedures that are used and help translators achieve the required quality of their products will be described. The next part will focus on the ex-post quality monitoring that was introduced a few years ago to systematically monitor both the quality of translations that leave the <b>Translation</b> <b>Service</b> and the individual performance of translators. The final part will be dedicated to a recently-adopted special procedure to ensure the best quality of the GSC <b>Translation</b> <b>Service’s</b> hallmark product – the European Council conclusions. The chapter is descriptively oriented and draws on everyday practice of a GSC's translator and the quality policy coordinator. Hopefully, it will raise awareness of the activities of the GSC's <b>Translation</b> <b>Service,</b> provide inspiration for other translation departments and practitioners and offer topics for further research for academia. With approximately 600 translators and 300 other management and support staff, the General Secretariat of the Council of the EU’s <b>Translation</b> <b>Service</b> is a little smaller than the European Parliament’s Directorate-General for Translation and about half the size of the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Translation, but still large by most standards. Each year the Council’s service translates around 15, 000 documents, which represent roughly 110, 000 pages of source material and a yearly translation output, expressed as a sum of all target languages, in the range of 1. 2 million pages (Council 2016 a, Council 2017). However, quality rather than quantity has always been the primary focus of the Council’s <b>Translation</b> <b>Service,</b> and the {{aim of this}} chapter is to describe the quality assurance mechanisms that are used at the Council’s <b>Translation</b> <b>Service</b> to ensure the required quality of its products...|$|R

Perhaps most significantly, Meedan is open licensing the linguistic data generated from its efforts.
