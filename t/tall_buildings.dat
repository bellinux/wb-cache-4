5|$|The Broadmead {{shopping}} centre was redeveloped {{in the early}} years of the century, involving the demolition of one the city's tallest mid-century towers, Tollgate House, in the construction of Cabot Circus. The former Bristol and West Tower was reworked into a glass skyscraper with glass panels in place of its concrete outer cladding. In 2005, the city council undertook extensive consultations about the future of <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> in Bristol, and identified support for new <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> so long as they are well designed, sustainable, distinctive and 'fit' into the existing urban landscape.|$|E

5|$|On 26 June, Iraqi {{government}} forces launched an airborne assault on Tikrit {{with three or}} four commando helicopters flown into a stadium at the University of Tikrit. One of the helicopters was shot down and crash-landed at the stadium, while another had to conduct an emergency landing after suffering a mechanical failure. The crew of the second helicopter, which included a Lebanese pilot, was then captured by insurgents. Fierce fighting then ensued around the university compound, while army snipers positioned themselves on <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> in the university complex. In {{the early hours of the}} assault, a helicopter gunship struck the city's hospital compound. By the next day, sporadic clashes continued at the university as Iranian-trained Shiite militiamen were dispatched and managed to seize control of <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> in the university area.|$|E
5|$|The bedrock {{underlying}} much of Manhattan is a {{mica schist}} known as Manhattan schist. It is a strong, competent metamorphic rock created when Pangaea formed. It {{is well suited}} for the foundations of <b>tall</b> <b>buildings.</b> In Central Park, outcrops of Manhattan Schist occur and Rat Rock is one rather large example.|$|E
5|$|Contractors in {{this type}} of {{construction}} faced many obstacles, both natural and man-made. They had to deal with rock formations and ground water, which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas mains, electric conduits, and steam pipes had to be rerouted. Street railways had to be torn up to allow the work. The foundations of <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed underpinning to ensure stability.|$|E
50|$|The JPMorgan Chase Tower, {{formerly}} Texas Commerce Tower, is a 305.4 m, 75-story, 2,243,013 sq.ft skyscraper at 600 Travis Street in Downtown Houston, Texas.

5|$|Despite Hong Kong's {{reputation}} of being intensely urbanised, the territory has tried to promote a green environment, and recent growing public concern has prompted the severe restriction of further land reclamation from Victoria Harbour. Awareness of the environment is growing as Hong Kong suffers from increasing pollution compounded by its geography and <b>tall</b> <b>buildings.</b> Approximately 80% of the city's smog originates {{from other parts of}} the Pearl River Delta.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, several {{portions}} of Downtown Brooklyn were rezoned to promote more commercial, residential, and retail development. This rezoning allowed for greater density of development, and {{combined with an}} increased demand for housing, these areas experienced a boom {{in the construction of}} <b>tall</b> <b>buildings.</b> In addition to Downtown Brooklyn, high-rise buildings are also concentrated in the Fort Greene and Williamsburg neighborhoods, although other Brooklyn neighborhoods have significant numbers of high-rises.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 2013, the Height Committee of the Chicago-based Council on <b>Tall</b> <b>Buildings</b> and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) {{made the}} {{controversial}} announcement that One World Trade Center was the tallest {{building in the}} United States at 1,776 feet, declaring that the mast {{on top of the}} building is a spire since it is a permanent part of the building's architecture. By the same reasoning, the building was also the tallest in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|Several of the {{downtown}} buildings were damaged in a major tornado in March 2008, scattering glass from several hundred feet. It took workers several days to clean the buildings and remove all of the loose shards of glass from the skyscrapers. No structural damage was reported, and by late 2010 each skyscraper had all of its windows replaced. Window blinds and other office objects from the <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> were found {{as far away as}} Oakland Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The 1916 Irondale {{earthquake}} struck north–central Alabama on October 18. The greatest {{earthquake in}} state history, it registered an estimated magnitude of 5.1 on the Richter magnitude scale {{and resulted in}} extensive minor damage. Damage, limited to Shelby and Jefferson counties, reached its maximum severity near the epicenter {{in the city of}} Irondale, including cracked windows, fallen chimneys, and dried-up wells. While there were no fatalities, the earthquake spawned widespread panic, sending alarmed workers from <b>tall</b> <b>buildings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vrbanja Bridge {{was located}} in no-man's-land during the Siege of Sarajevo (1992–96). It was {{surrounded}} by <b>tall</b> <b>buildings,</b> which made it a target of sniper-fire {{from the beginning of}} the Bosnian War. On 5 April 1992, six protestors were shot on the bridge by Serb snipers. Two women, Suada Dilberović and Olga Sučić, died as a result, and are considered the first victims of the siege by Bosniaks and Croats.|$|E

5|$|Annual {{variations}} in climatic temperatures can affect sex ratios, since loggerheads have temperature-dependent sex determination. High sand temperatures may skew gender ratios {{in favor of}} females. Nesting sites exposed to unseasonably warm temperatures {{over a three-year period}} produced 87–99% females. This raises concern over the connection between rapid global temperature changes and the possibility of population extinction. A more localized effect on gender skewing comes from the construction of <b>tall</b> <b>buildings,</b> which reduce sun exposure, lowering the average sand temperature, which results in a shift in gender ratios to favor the emergence of male turtles.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around <b>tall</b> <b>buildings,</b> perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. Artificial lighting causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E
5|$|Crush {{contains}} ten {{levels in}} each of the four locations, all based on an event in Danny's past. The levels represent Danny's mind: a dark city landscape with many <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> and the occasional street lamp, a hotel resting aside a seaside location, a dark and mysterious funfair, and a haunted childhood bedroom. Levels are mostly composed of platforms formed by blocks. The player's goal in each level is to collect marbles, which give the player points based on their color. The exit from the level is opened once a predetermined number of points have been collected. Danny can crawl into narrow areas and jump a small height.|$|E

5|$|In Washington, D.C., {{sustained}} winds remained below {{tropical storm}} force, though gusts reached 71mph (114km/h) as {{recorded by the}} National Academy of Science. Hurricane-force winds existed several hundred feet in the air, with wind sensors {{on the top of}} <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> recording winds of 70 to 85mph (115 to 135km/h). Rainfall was minimal, amounting to around two inches across the district. A gauge on Wisconsin Avenue recorded a storm surge of 11.3feet (3.4m), and a gauge on a pier in the southwest portion of the district recorded a storm surge of 10.25feet (3.1m). Both observations were records, surpassing the previous observation set by the 1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In {{the dense}} areas, {{most of the}} {{concentration}} is via medium- and high-rise buildings. London's skyscrapers, such as 30 St Mary Axe, Tower 42, the Broadgate Tower and One Canada Square, are mostly in the two financial districts, the City of London and Canary Wharf. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of St Paul's Cathedral and other historic buildings. Nevertheless, {{there are a number}} of very tall skyscrapers in central London (see <b>Tall</b> <b>buildings</b> in London), including the 95-storey Shard London Bridge, the tallest building in the European Union.|$|E
5|$|It is {{one thing}} to say that a bird has a {{property}} right in its nest, or that a wolf has a property right in its den – specific bits of territory used exclusively by one animal family. But the habitat that animals need to survive extends far beyond such specific and exclusive bits of territory – animals often need to fly or roam over vast territories shared by many other animals. Protecting a bird’s nest is of little help if the nearby watering holes are polluted, or if <b>tall</b> <b>buildings</b> block its flight path. It’s not clear how ideas of property rights can help here.|$|E
