25|$|What we call {{religious}} {{experiences can}} differ greatly. Some reports exist of supernatural happenings {{that it would}} be difficult to explain from a rational, scientific point of view. On the other hand, there also exist the sort of testimonies that simply seem to convey a feeling of peace or oneness – something which most of us, religious or not, may possibly relate to. In categorizing religious experiences it is perhaps helpful <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> as explicable through one of two theories: the Objectivist thesis or the Subjectivist thesis.|$|E
500|$|In 1888 Francis {{developed}} diphtheria {{and died}} on 11 September. Overwhelmed with grief, Pankhurst commissioned two {{portraits of the}} dead boy but was unable <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> and hid them in a bedroom cupboard. The family concluded that a faulty drainage system {{at the back of}} their house had caused their son's illness. Pankhurst blamed the poor conditions of the neighbourhood, and the family moved to a more affluent middle class district at Russell Square. She was soon pregnant once more and declared that the child was [...] "Frank coming again." [...] She gave birth to a son on 7 July 1889 and named him Henry Francis in honour of his deceased brother.|$|E

500|$|Bellerophon {{anchored}} off Brixham on {{the morning}} of 24 July, and there Maitland received orders from Admiral Lord Keith to [...] "prevent every person whatever from coming on board the ship you command, except the officers and men who compose her crew." [...] Despite turning away the shore boats which approached the anchored warship bringing fresh bread and fruit to sell, word eventually leaked out that Napoleon was aboard the ship. The news created a sensation, and large numbers of boats filled with sightseers soon surrounded the ship. Occasionally Napoleon would come out <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> but despite entreaties from some people to be allowed on board, Maitland refused to allow any contact between ship and shore. On 26 July Bellerophon received orders to proceed to Plymouth harbour where Lord Keith was anchored aboard his flagship [...] Napoleon remained on board Bellerophon and the ship was kept isolated from the throngs of curious sightseers by two guardships, [...] and , anchored close at hand.|$|E
500|$|Bevin {{advocated}} {{shifting the}} state's tax code away from [...] "productivity" [...] taxes, such as income taxes, to [...] "consumption taxes" [...] such as sales taxes, {{a move that}} Conway called [...] "regressive".

Bevin also called {{for the elimination of}} many of Kentucky's $10 billion in [...] "tax expenditures", which he called [...] "Frankfort-speak for loopholes". Asked to specify which expenditures he would eliminate, Bevin said, [...] "I'm {{not going to give you}} specifics at this point in time. There are many of these loopholes that frankly are not conducive to developing the economy. There are some that make sense, and those will continue. ...e have already identified what many of them will be. But at this point, we're going to have <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> in totality. I'm not gonna give you specifics at this time. I'm just not." ...|$|E

In a win over [...] on January 2, 2005, he replaced Sammy Mejía and scored nine points for his best scoring performance of the season.

2500|$|Harris {{approached}} another {{table where}} two girls were hiding. He bent down <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> and dismissed them as [...] "pathetic". Harris {{then moved to}} another table where he fired twice, injuring 16-year-olds Nicole Nowlen and John Tomlin. When Tomlin attempted {{to move away from}} the table, Klebold kicked him. Harris then taunted Tomlin's attempt at escape before Klebold shot the youth repeatedly, killing him. Harris then walked back over to the other side of the table where Lauren Townsend lay dead. Behind the table, a 16-year-old girl named Kelly Fleming had, like Bree Pasquale, sat next to the table rather than beneath it due to a lack of space. Harris shot Fleming with his shotgun, hitting her in the back and killing her instantly. He shot at the table behind Fleming, hitting Townsend and Kreutz again, and wounding 18-year-old Jeanna Park. An autopsy later revealed that Townsend died from the earlier gunshots inflicted by Klebold.|$|E
2500|$|The Equivalents are {{sometimes}} {{recognized as the}} first intentionally abstract photographs, although this claim {{may be difficult to}} uphold given Alvin Langdon Coburn's Vortographs that were created almost a decade earlier. Nonetheless, it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> today and understand the impact that they had at the time. When they first appeared photography had been generally recognized as a distinct art form for no more than fifteen years, and until Stieglitz introduced his cloud photos there was no tradition of photographing something that was not recognizable in both form and content. Art critic Hilton Kramer said that Equivalents [...] "undoubtedly owe something to the American modernist painting (Dove's and O'Keeffe's especially) that Stieglitz felt particularly close to at the time. Yet they go distinctly beyond the pictorial conventions that governed avant-garde painting in this period by reaching for the kind of lyric abstraction that was not to enter American painting until the 40's and 50's. In the line that can be traced from the paintings of Albert Pinkham Ryder to, say, those of Clyfford Still, it is in Stieglitz's Equivalents – rather than in painting itself – that we find the strongest link." ...|$|E

Of other world {{religions}}, he writes: [...] "All these religions are true for me as Canterbury Cathedral is a true thing and as a Swiss chalet is a true thing. There they are, and they have served a purpose, they have worked. Only they are not true for me to live in them.... They do not work for me". In The Fate of Homo Sapiens, published in 1939, Wells criticised almost all world religions and philosophies, stating [...] "there is no creed, no way of living {{left in the world}} at all, that really meets the needs of the time… When we come <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> coolly and dispassionately, all the main religions, patriotic, moral and customary systems in which human beings are sheltering today, appear to be in a state of jostling and mutually destructive movement, like the houses and palaces and other buildings of some vast, sprawling city overtaken by a landslide.|$|E
2500|$|Eberhard Grisebach {{visited him}} in March, writing to Helen Spengler of Kirchner's condition: [...] "I spent two mornings with Kirchner which I shall never forget. I found him sitting on a very low chair next to a small, hot stove in a yellow-painted, sloping-roofed attic. Only {{with the help of}} a stick was he able to walk, {{staggering}} around the room. ... A colourfully painted curtain concealed a large collection of paintings. When we began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> he came alive. Together with me, he saw all his experiences drift by on canvas, the small, timid-looking woman set aside what we had seen and brought a bottle of wine. He made short explanatory remarks in a weary voice. Each picture had its own particular colourful character, a great sadness was present in all of them; what I had previously found to be incomprehensible and unfinished now created the same delicate and sensitive impression as his personality. Everywhere a search for style, for psychological understanding of his figures. The most moving was a self- portrait in uniform with his right hand cut off. Then he showed me his travel permit for Switzerland. He wanted to go back to Davos... and implored me to ask father for a medical certificate. ... As the woman with him rightly said, though many people want to help him, nobody is able to do so any longer. ... When I was leaving, I thought of Van Gogh’s fate and thought that it would be his as well, sooner or later. Only later will people understand and see how much he has contributed to painting".|$|E
