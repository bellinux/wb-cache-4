5|$|All but Daniel Ricciardo {{did their}} first run in Q3 on used tyres {{in order to}} save a set for the race, with Hamilton fastest yet again. When the cars came around for their second and final timed laps, Ricciardo crossed the line first ahead of the Ferrari drivers, with Vettel going faster than {{teammate}} Räikkönen. When the two Mercedes came across the line last, Hamilton took his fourth consecutive pole position, while Nico Rosberg had <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> third on the grid, not being able to beat Vettel's time. The two Williams cars filled the third row, while Nico Hülkenberg was delighted with eighth on the grid.|$|E
5|$|Brin had {{originally}} {{wanted to build}} three ships, but their great cost forced him <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> two. At the time, Italy's industrial capacity was insufficient to build the ships out of domestic material. Everything from the iron used to build the hulls to the ships' machinery and guns had to be imported. The Caio Duilio class {{formed the basis for}} the following two ironclad designs, the , also designed by Brin and laid down in 1876, and the , designed by Giuseppe Micheli and laid down in 188182.|$|E

Against Chivas USA, United went up 2–0 before conceding twice <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a 2–2 draw. Against Real Salt Lake, Dwayne De Rosario netted a hat trick in the match {{within the first}} 31 minutes, scoring the fastest hat trick in MLS history, earning him Player of the Week honors.

5|$|In {{the later}} part of 1186, {{after the death}} of King Henry's son Geoffrey– who was Duke of Brittany– King Philip II of France demanded that Geoffrey's daughters be placed in the French king's custody, and that the duchy of Brittany, which Geoffrey had ruled in right of his wife, be {{surrendered}} into French royal custody. Coutances was one of the negotiators sent by King Henry to secure a settlement, but they had <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a temporary truce. In January 1188 Coutances took the cross when he pledged to go on Crusade along with King Henry and King Philip of France.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half, Chris Turner hit Darrius Heyward-Bey {{for a short}} bubble screen pass behind the line of scrimmage, and Heyward-Bey ran it 63yards for the score. During the next series, the Terrapins were held three-and-out, but the punt was fumbled and {{recovered}} by Maryland on the Hokies 11-yard line. However, the Terrapins were again forced <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a field goal, which made it a one-possession lead for VT at 20–13with 2:29left in the third quarter. In the final quarter, the Hokies managed another field goal and held onto the lead for a final result of 23–13.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{conflicts}} arose {{within the}} anti-Swedish alliance between Habsburg and Poland-Lithuania when Habsburg demanded ever more contributions while not showing the war efforts Poland-Lithuania had expected. With the Russo-Polish War ongoing, most Polish–Lithuanian forces were bound in Ukraine. England, France and the Dutch Republic had {{agreed on a}} petition in the First Concert of the Hague, urging Sweden <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> peace with Denmark on the terms of Roskilde, and peace talks mediated by France were taking place throughout 1659.|$|E

5|$|The Aggies {{scored on}} their opening {{possession}} with a 35-yard touchdown with a screen pass from Stephen McGee to Mike Goodson. The Longhorns mustered twofirst downs, but {{were forced to}} punt. Texas A ended their subsequent drive three plays later with a punt of their own. The Longhorns again successfully penetrated into Texas A territory, but Mack Brown opted to call a pooch punt by Colt McCoy on fourthdown and four from the Aggie 37-yard line. The Aggies answered with an eighteen-play drive that stalled on the UT-14 yardline and the Aggies had <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a 31-yard field goal by Matt Szymanski.|$|E
5|$|The Crimson Tide {{scored on}} its next two {{possessions}} as well, and McCarron completed touchdown passes to running backs Kenyan Drake and Jalston Fowler. With the lead at 35–0 {{late in the}} second quarter, Alabama played its reserves {{for much of the}} remainder of the game. After the Crimson Tide defense forced another punt from the Panthers, McCarron was replaced by backup quarterback Blake Sims. On his first possession at the helm of Alabama's offense, Sims led the team to the Georgia State one-yard line, but a pair of false starts forced Alabama <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a field goal that increased the lead to 38–0 at halftime.|$|E

5|$|After Georgia Tech's post-score kickoff, Wake Forest {{continued}} to struggle on offense. Quarterback Riley Skinner was sacked, threw an 18-yard completion, then three incomplete passes. Wake {{was forced to}} punt the ball away again, allowing the Yellow Jackets the possibility of expanding their lead. On Tech's first play after the punt, however, Reggie Ball's pass was intercepted, allowing Wake Forest another chance on offense. The play turned {{the momentum of the}} game in favor of Wake Forest, who proceeded to move the ball with slightly more effectiveness. During the Wake Forest drive, Skinner completed a 39-yard pass to John Tereshinski, who drove the Deacons inside Georgia Tech territory, where the drive continued. Though Wake Forest was forced <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a 33-yard field goal from kicker Sam Swank, the score tied the game at 66 with 7:59 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{excellent}} field position, Virginia Tech seemed in position for an easy score. However, after a quick Tech first down, the Georgia defense stiffened and Tech was forced <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a field goal. The 28-yard kick by Brandon Pace cut Georgia's lead to 31–24, but only 3:42 remained on the clock. Due to the short time remaining, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick in order to have another chance at offense. The kick was recovered by Georgia, however, and the Bulldogs proceeded to rush the ball in three consecutive plays, forcing the Hokies to use their last timeout in order to conserve time for one final drive.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the most}} ambitious and {{expensive}} projects in the history of maritime archaeology, the Mary Rose project broke new ground within this field in the UK. Besides becoming {{one of the}} first wrecks to be protected under the new Protection of Wrecks Act in 1973 it also created several new precedents. It {{was the first time that}} a British privately funded project was able to apply modern scientific standards fully and without having to auction off part of the findings to finance its activities; where previous projects often had <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> just a partial recovery of finds, everything found in connection with the Mary Rose was recovered and recorded. The raising of the vessel made it possible to establish the first historic shipwreck museum in the UK to receive government accreditation and funding. The excavation of the Mary Rose wreck site proved that it was possible to achieve a level of exactness in underwater excavations comparable to those on dry land.|$|E

5|$|Finucane {{spent the}} winter of 1939–40 gaining as much flight {{practice}} as possible. He was unable to gain any hours in fighter aircraft and was abruptly transferred to the practice and parachute test flight centre at RAF Henlow and had <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> making trips around airfields in an antiquated Vickers Virginia as a co-pilot ferrying engineers and ground crew from 16 September 1939. That month German forces invaded Poland (1 September) prompting Britain and France to declare war on Germany and beginning the war in Europe. Finucane's piloting skills were far from being at the acceptable level for a fighter pilot. He continued in this trend until May 1940 until {{he was assigned to}} flying Miles Magister training aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Getzlaf {{made his}} first {{appearance}} with the senior team at the 2008 World Championship. He led the tournament with 11 assists and his 14 points was second overall to teammate Dany Heatley's 20. Canada reached the championship game, but were forced <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> the silver medal after Russia overcame a two-goal third period deficit and won the championship 5–4 in overtime. Getzlaf {{was named to the}} Canadian roster for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, however a sprained ankle suffered during the NHL season left his participation in doubt until just before Canada was required to confirm its roster. He had recovered enough to play and recorded seven points in seven games, including the game-winning goal in Canada's 3–2 semi-final victory over Slovakia. Canada won the gold medal with a 3–2 overtime victory over the United States.|$|E

Although they all appealed and were allowed in 1874 <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a much lower amount, to restore shareholders' confidence the directors had all been replaced by October 1872 and Edward Watkin appointed chairman. Watkin was an experienced railwayman and already on the board of several railway companies, including the South Eastern Railway (SER), and had an aspiration to construct a line from the north through London to that railway.|$|E
