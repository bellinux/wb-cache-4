5|$|A defense-appointed {{expert witness}} {{in the field of}} {{biomechanics}} testified on March 5 that Nosek could not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward, he could not have sustained an injury to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> He further said that if Nosek fell over the first row of the fans, he must have been not only pushed, but must have jumped himself. The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony, claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time, {{as well as some of}} the eyewitness testimonies, according to which Nosek fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall. The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} match, Carlito faced Mankind, who {{was chosen by}} the fans' vote with 52%. The match began when Carlito {{performed}} a dropkick on Mankind. However, Mankind got the advantage over Carlito. Midway through the match, Mankind tried to use a steel chair on Carlito, but Carlito avoided, executeing drop toe-hold, sending Mankind into the steel steps. Mankind rose to his feet, which led Carlito to perform a standing dropkick, resulting in Mankind to hit <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> into the steel steps. Back in the ring, Mankind received the upper hand after delivering a DDT and forced Carlito to submit with the Mandible claw and win the match.|$|E

5|$|Nosek's other friend Ondřej Vlach {{testified that}} Nosek's fall {{happened}} in a break {{between the end of}} concert and the encore. Nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage. According to him, Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off. While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to Vlach, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break. Vlach further testified that after the fall, Nosek went to sit on a bench, where he was fetched a water bottle. Nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion. Vlach said that he understood Blythe's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{individuals}} that Hergé could have learned about through Blanchard's article was the Chicago-based American gangster Al Capone. In the preceding story, Tintin in the Congo, Capone had been introduced as a character within the series. There, {{he was responsible for}} running a diamond smuggling racket that Tintin exposed, setting up for further confrontation in Tintin in America. Capone was one of only two real-life individuals to be named in The Adventures of Tintin, and was the only real-life figure to appear as a character in the series. In the original version, Hergé avoided depicting him directly, either illustrating <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> or hiding his face behind a scarf; this was altered in the second version, in which Capone's face was depicted. It is not known if Capone ever learned about his inclusion in the story, although during initial serialisation he would have been preoccupied with his trial and ensuing imprisonment.|$|E

25|$|On 21 July 1980, Bitar {{was shot}} dead in Paris. That morning, he {{received}} a telephone call to meet a journalist {{at the office of}} al-Ihiyyaa al-Arabi. As he was exiting the elevator to enter his office, his assassin fired two shots to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> The identity of his killer was never discovered, but it was reported that Assad ordered the assassination. At the time, Bitar had reported to local authorities in France that he had received death threats by mail and telephone. He took personal measures by limiting his movements.|$|E

There were also about a dozen small lacerations around his head, face, and neck. His injuries were deemed too severe for doctors to operate on him. Shepard never regained consciousness and remained on full life support. While he lay in intensive care and in the days following the attack, candlelight vigils were held around the world.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of the game, Chinese forward Li Yi {{deliberately}} kicked Lee's right shin after Lee completed a pass. Having recovered from a recent ankle injury, Lee was upset at Li's foul play and slapped Li on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> thereafter which Li Yi started to roll on the ground grabbing his head. For a while the entire Chinese and Korean squad ran toward the scene resulting in brief ruckus and some degree of physical contact but further conflict did not occur, as the referee awarded a yellow card for Li (simulation) and a red card for Lee (violence).|$|E
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} proceedings, no one actually identified who fired the gun that killed Aquino, but Rebecca Quijano, another passenger, testified {{that she saw}} a man behind Aquino (running from the stairs towards Aquino and his escorts) point a gun at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{then there was the}} sound of a gunshot. A post-mortem analysis disclosed that Aquino was shot in the back of the head at close range with the bullet exiting at the chin at a downward angle, which supported Quijano's testimony. More suspicions were aroused when Quijano described the assassin as wearing a military uniform.|$|E

25|$|Although Bane {{had sworn}} off using Venom in Vengeance of Bane II in 1995, and his {{character}} is actually written as having kept {{that promise to}} himself, {{it is still not}} uncommon for artists to draw Bane as still wearing the tube leading from his old wrist device to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> as well as almost all media adaptations of the character show him actively using the Venom compound. Writer Gail Simone explained these lapses in the continuity of Bane's appearance in an issue of Secret Six, in which Deadshot remarked that Bane merely kept his old Venom equipment with him out of habit, even though Bane states that he would sooner die than use it again.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Edge faced Booker T. Booker T gained the {{advantage}} {{early on in}} the match. However, Edge recovered by countering Booker's top rope attack with a hurricanrana and followed this up with a spinning heel kick off the top rope. Booker T executed a Scissors Kick, for a near-fall while Edge delivered a spear for a near fall. After performing his own version of Booker's Spinaroonie, Edge won the match with an Edgecution. Backstage, a cautious Hurricane was interviewed by Jonathan Coachman about winning the Hardcore Championship. The Hurricane's sidekick, Mighty Molly, appeared and suggested the two should go to their Hurri-Cycle. Just as Hurricane headed to that direction, Molly smashed a frying pan onto <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and pinned him to become the new Hardcore Champion.|$|E
