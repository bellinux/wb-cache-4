500|$|On June 14 and 22, 2005, Deep Impact {{observed}} two {{outbursts of}} activity from the comet, {{the latter being}} six {{times larger than the}} former. The spacecraft studied the images of various distant stars to determine its current trajectory and position. Don Yeomans, a mission co-investigator for JPL pointed out that [...] "it takes 7½ minutes for the signal to get back to Earth, so you cannot joystick this <b>thing.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> rely {{on the fact that the}} Impactor is a smart spacecraft as is the Flyby spacecraft. So you have to build in the intelligence ahead of time and let it do its thing." [...] On June 23, 2005, the first of the two final trajectory correct maneuvers (targeting maneuver) was successfully executed. A 6m/s (20ft/s) velocity change was needed to adjust the flight path towards the comet and target the impactor at a window in space about [...] wide.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{credited}} {{the series}} for its bold premise {{and noted that}} the show provided some insight into eating disorders while offering [...] "a few flashes of clever dialogue and satire." [...] Ultimately, however, the Times found that [...] "Starved relies too heavily on sight gags and gross-out farce." [...] The Los Angeles Times found the show [...] "vexing" [...] for being [...] "at once assured and shallow, accomplished and unconvincing, well-acted and empty." [...] The review singles out Schaeffer's character Sam as [...] "especially unappealing" [...] and points to Schaeffer's roles as creator, producer, writer and director as [...] "an object lesson in the wisdom {{of a system of}} checks and balances." [...] Perhaps most damningly, in noting Schaeffer's experiences with addiction, the reviewer writes that [...] "just because you’ve had an experience doesn’t mean you have anything interesting to say about it or are able to articulate whatever interesting <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say." ...|$|E
500|$|Since its {{original}} airing, critics have listed [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" [...] {{among the best}} X-Files episodes. TV Guide called it the tenth greatest episode in television history. Review website IGN named it the best standalone X-Files episode of the entire series, writing that the episode [...] " [...] is a distinctive episode of the series, mixing a healthy amount of humor [...] with some very nasty business [...] In just 44 minutes, Boyle creates a fully formed character who makes a big impact in his one and only appearance." [...] Topless Robot named it the ninth-funniest episode of the series. Starpulse listed it as the third-best X-Files episode. Charlie Jane Anders and Javier Grillo-Marxuach of io9 included it {{on the list of}} [...] "10 TV Episodes that Changed Television". Tom Kessenich, in Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, named the episode the seventh-best installment of the series, noting that it features [...] "a wonderful blend of humor, drama, and pathos, something The X-Files did better than just about any other show this past decade." [...] The cast and crew of the series have expressed their enjoyment of the installment. Duchovny considers [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" [...] to be one of his favorite episodes of the third season. Nutter highlighted it {{as one of the most}} enjoyable entries that he had worked on. He also noted that, [...] "the writing was so tight and so crisp and so fresh that I think, as a director, the only <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do is create the atmosphere, set up the characters, set up the shots and you are basically invisible. Then you step back and just let it happen." [...] Series writer and producer Frank Spotnitz stated that the episode worked on many levels and that it is his favorite of the episodes written for the show by Morgan. In 2016, Ira Madison of Vulture.com named it the best episode of the series and [...] "one of the best episodes of television ever", stating that the episode [...] "takes every element that made the series so iconic and throws them all into one heartbreaking installment".|$|E
