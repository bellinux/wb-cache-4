5|$|As in {{his other}} films, von Stroheim used Christian imagery and symbols, such as crosses and churches. Trina first shows signs of greed on Easter Sunday and is murdered by McTeague on Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve was often {{depicted}} in von Stroheim's films and {{was close to the}} date of his father's death. Lennig asserted that the character of McTeague's father (who was only briefly mentioned in the novel) is based on von Stroheim's own father, while McTeague's mother is a tribute to von Stroheim's mother, to whom Greed is dedicated. Von Stroheim stated that he considered all of his good qualities <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from his mother and all of his bad qualities <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from his father.|$|E

5|$|The {{yellowhammer}} {{was described}} by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae in 1758 under its current scientific name. Emberiza {{is derived from the}} Old German embritz, a bunting, and citrinella is the Italian for a small yellow bird.

5|$|This {{research}} has shown that there was a single origin of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis in the Amanita genus. DNA analysis has shown that a group of species in the subsection Vittadiniae (which includes S.thiersii) has few derived characteristics.

5|$|Before being {{exported}} {{from the}} district, all furs {{had to pass}} through depots manned by a quarantine officer appointed by the Board of Health. Any furs believed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> into contact with parts of the district infected by smallpox were to be destroyed. This led to some problems for the Government of Canada after the Council was dissolved. Some people whose furs had been destroyed under these regulations applied to the Government for compensation, as no mechanism {{was put in place}} when the Act was drafted. These claims for compensation were considered, but ultimately ignored.|$|E
5|$|Earlier {{hypotheses}} of the epidemic's origin have varied. Some hypothesized the flu {{originated in}} East Asia. Dr. C.

He considered several other hypotheses of origin, such as Spain, Kansas, and Brest, as being possible, but not likely.|$|E

This was followed shortly thereafter by the band's first U.S. tour since 2000, where much of this new material was debuted.|$|E

Olaus Magnus, who depicted the walrus in the Carta Marina in 1539, first referred to the walrus as the ros marus, probably a Latinization of morž, and this was adopted by Linnaeus in his binomial nomenclature.|$|E
