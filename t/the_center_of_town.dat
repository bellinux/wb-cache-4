5|$|In La Pintada, {{a remote}} fishing village of around 400residents {{situated}} {{to the west}} of Acapulco, a mudslide occurred on September14, which within a few minutes, swept through <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> As such, many residents initially wandered throughout town in a state of panic and confusion; it took two days for word of the mudslide to spread to the public. Throughout the village, 71people were killed. Over half the town, including 20homes, were demolished due to the mudslide. A total of 334people were evacuated by police, though 30elected to stay in the area until all the victims had been identified.

5|$|The 20th century brought {{improvements}} to energy and domestic systems: electrical service {{was introduced in}} 1915; and in 1941, just before World WarII, the town installed a water system. The construction of Interstate 81 (I-81) during the early 1960s depressed business development in the town. The wagon road, which had been made part of U.S. Route 11, had led traffic through <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> but the interstate passed less than {{a tenth of a}} mile to the east, drawing off development, retail trade and ultimately, businesses. This caused downtown to decline. Developers constructed new residential subdivisions both within and outside the town boundaries to the east for access to I-81.|$|E
5|$|US40Alternate {{enters the}} town of Boonsboro and its name changes to Main Street at its {{intersection}} with MarylandRoute68 (MD68) (Lappans Road).

5|$|Doctor Phlox treats her {{injury and}} discovers {{that she is}} one-quarter Skagaran. Meanwhile, back on the planet, Bennings hands in his deputy badge because MacReady orders him not to take any further action against the Skagarans. Archer returns in a shuttlepod along with T'Pol and a {{security}} crew, led by Lieutenant Reed — all wearing their modern uniforms. Landing in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> he informs the Sheriff that he is from Earth and will return to help them once their mission is over. Bennings then shoots MacReady, starting a firefight. In the chaos, Archer is also shot by Bennings, but finally overpowers him in a fistfight. Enterprise then departs, but not before returning Bethany to the surface, and providing her with a PADD to educate the local children about Earth's recent history.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days, houses were wooden boards fronted by a four-board-high fence which was fronted with a boardwalk. Most {{of the streets}} were dirt roads. Winters were bitterly cold, and teams of horses {{dragging}} V-shaped wooden plows cleared the streets. In <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> was the community pump, from which the village would draw water at stipulated hours. Water was pumped from the mine twice a day through a big open pipe. Everyone had to carry water home during pumping time. There was no shutoff valve, so buckets, tubs and barrels were used for water storage. Later, a water tower was built to hold water drawn from a deep well. St. Bernard dogs helped carry {{the water from the}} well to the homes. Running water and bathtubs came only after ditches were dug for pipes to provide water from Gilbert around 1916. Kerosene lamps provided the means of lighting until 1916, when power lines were installed. Initially, the only telephone was at the Elba mine office.|$|E
5|$|MD 213 enters Cecil County upon {{crossing}} the Sassafras River, where it continues north through wooded and agricultural areas with some residences. The route enters Cecilton, where it becomes Bohemia Avenue. In Cecilton, MD 213 passes residences and intersects MD 282 (Main Street) in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> Upon leaving Cecilton, {{the name of}} the road becomes Augustine Herman Highway again. MD 213 passes through farmland, with intermittent woods and rural residences, before crossing over the Bohemia River.
