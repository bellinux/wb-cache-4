5|$|On 20 January 1954, 706 Squadron, a second-line unit, flew aboard {{to conduct}} {{trials of the}} anti-submarine version of <b>the</b> <b>Whirlwind</b> helicopter. They were {{successful}} enough that the squadron was redesignated as 845 Squadron afterwards and Perseus ferried them to Malta in April. The ship continued on to deliver relief supplies to Singapore intended for Korea and was reduced to reserve again upon her return on 12 July. The Admiralty intended to convert her to a submarine depot ship and she was towed to Belfast to begin work in 1955. The cutbacks from the 1957 Defence White Paper caused the conversion to be cancelled and the ship was towed to Gare Loch to await a decision on the ship's disposition. Perseus sold for scrap in May 1958 and towed to Port Glasgow to begin demolition.|$|E

25|$|No. 263 Squadron moved {{south to}} RAF Exeter and was {{declared}} operational with <b>the</b> <b>Whirlwind</b> on 7 December 1940. Initial operations consisted of convoy patrols and anti E-boat missions. The Whirlwind’s first confirmed kill occurred on 8 February 1941, when an Arado Ar 196 floatplane was shot down; <b>the</b> <b>Whirlwind</b> responsible also {{crashed into the}} sea and the pilot was killed. From then on the squadron was to have considerable success with <b>the</b> <b>Whirlwind</b> while flying against enemy Junkers Ju 88s, Dornier Do 217s, Messerschmitt Bf 109s and Focke-Wulf Fw 190s.|$|E
2500|$|Their first {{recorded}} collaboration was in 1964, when Gouldman's band <b>The</b> <b>Whirlwinds</b> recorded <b>the</b> Lol Creme composition, [...] "Baby Not Like You", as the B-side of their only single. <b>The</b> <b>Whirlwinds</b> then changed members and name, becoming The Mockingbirds (including singer-guitarist Gouldman, bassist Bernard Basso and drummer Kevin Godley, formerly of The Sabres with Creme). The Mockingbirds recorded five singles in 1965–66 without any success, before dissolving. The guitarist in both <b>The</b> <b>Whirlwinds</b> and <b>The</b> Mockingbirds was Stephen Jacobson, brother of well-known writer Howard Jacobson.|$|R

25|$|After The Shooting was completed, {{production}} immediately commenced on Hellman's Ride in <b>the</b> <b>Whirlwind,</b> {{a similarly}} mysterious western that also featured Nicholson and Perkins in the cast. Both films were completed {{in a total}} of six weeks of continuous shooting (three weeks per film).|$|E
2500|$|... 263 Squadron also {{occasionally}} {{carried out}} day bomber escort missions with <b>the</b> <b>Whirlwinds.</b> One example {{was when they}} formed part of the escort of 54 Blenheims on a low-level raid against power stations near Cologne on 12 August 1941; owing to the relatively short range of the escorts, including <b>the</b> <b>Whirlwinds,</b> <b>the</b> fighters turned back near Antwerp, with the bombers continuing on without escort.

25|$|The {{film was}} shot in 1965 in the Utah desert, {{back-to-back}} with Hellman's similar western, Ride in <b>the</b> <b>Whirlwind,</b> which also starred Nicholson. Both films were shown at several international film festivals {{but it was not}} until 1968 that the U.S. distribution rights were purchased by the Walter Reade Organization. No other domestic distributor had expressed any interest in the films. Walter Reade decided to bypass a theatrical release, and the two titles were sold directly to television.|$|E
25|$|No. 263 Squadron, {{the first}} and last {{squadron}} to operate <b>the</b> <b>Whirlwind,</b> flew its last Whirlwind mission on 29 November 1943, turning in their aeroplanes and converting to the Hawker Typhoon in December that year. On 1 January 1944, the type was declared obsolete. The remaining serviceable aircraft were transferred to No. 18 Maintenance Unit, while those undergoing repairs or overhaul were allowed to be repaired only if they were in near-flyable condition. An official letter forbade aircraft needing repair to be worked on.|$|E

25|$|L6844 first flew on 11 October 1938, {{construction}} {{having been}} delayed chiefly due to the new features and {{also because of the}} late delivery of the engines. L6844 was passed to RAE Farnborough {{at the end of the}} year, while further service trials were later carried out at Martlesham Heath. <b>The</b> <b>Whirlwind</b> exhibited excellent handling characteristics and proved to be very easy to fly at all speeds. The only exception was the inadequate directional control during take-off which necessitated an increased rudder area above the tailplane.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Watson starred with Julia Roberts and Carrie-Anne Moss in Fireflies in the Garden, the Lifetime Television movie The Memory Keeper's Daughter (based on {{the novel}} with the same name), and in screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's directorial debut, Synecdoche, New York. In 2009 she {{appeared}} in the film Cold Souls, from first-time director Sophie Barthes, and Within <b>the</b> <b>Whirlwind,</b> a biographical film of Russian poet and Gulag survivor Evgenia Ginzburg from The Luzhin Defence director Marleen Gorris.

25|$|After peaking during <b>the</b> <b>whirlwind</b> {{campaign}} {{west of the}} Oder, {{the morale}} of the French troops hit a new low point in Poland. The bad weather and approaching winter made Napoleon's troops very reluctant to continue the campaign. The Polish roads went from deep mud to frozen ruts as the weather grew colder. The emperor was forced to dispense a bonus in pay and extra shirts and shoes for his soldiers. Even so, French military discipline grew worse. At this time, Napoleon first used the term, les grognards (the grumblers), to describe his troops.|$|E
2500|$|Gouldman {{was born}} in Broughton, Salford, Lancashire, England into a Jewish family.

25|$|On Leo Amery's {{suggestion}} Wilson's colleague Gerald Ellison {{was appointed}} Secretary of the War Office (Reconstitution) Committee (see Esher Report), {{which consisted of}} Esher, Admiral John Fisher and Sir George Clarke. Wilson approved of Esher’s aims, but not <b>the</b> <b>whirlwind</b> speed by which he began making changes at the War Office. Wilson impressed Esher, and {{was put in charge}} of the new department which managed Staff College, RMA, RMC and officers’ promotion exams. Wilson often travelled around Britain and Ireland to supervise the training of officers and examinations for promotion.|$|E
25|$|While {{reliability}} {{problems were}} {{not uncommon for}} Rolls-Royce's new engine designs of the era, the company's testing department was told to spend all of their time on developing the more powerful Merlin to maturity. As {{a result of the}} Merlin's priority, the unreliable Peregrine was eventually abandoned with production ending in 1942. Other cannon-armed fighters such as the Hawker Typhoon and the Bristol Beaufighter were becoming available and as <b>the</b> <b>Whirlwind</b> had been tightly designed around the Peregrine, changing to a different engine at this stage was not a feasible option. Only 116 Whirlwinds and a corresponding number of Peregrines (301) were built.|$|E
25|$|Millie Perkins as The Woman. Former teen model Perkins was Hellman's next-door {{neighbor}} {{when she was}} cast as the enigmatic, unnamed woman who leads the search party to their doom. The Shooting was her fifth film, immediately followed by another starring role in Hellman's companion western, Ride in <b>the</b> <b>Whirlwind.</b> Although Perkins enjoyed working on both of Hellman's westerns, and became good friends with Warren Oates, she was dismayed that Hellman insisted on such realism that he allowed only the most minimal of makeup {{to be applied to}} the actors. She felt she was constantly filmed in an unflattering manner.|$|E

For the next three seasons, he spent time with three teams {{connected}} to the Harlem Globetrotters exhibition team: <b>the</b> Boston <b>Whirlwinds,</b> <b>the</b> House of David, and the Washington Generals. In one game with <b>the</b> <b>Whirlwinds,</b> Spivey got into a fight with Globetrotters player Bobby [...] "Showboat" [...] Hall. For the 1955–56 and 1956–57 seasons, Spivey played for another barnstorming team, the New York Olympians, later renamed the Kentucky Colonels.|$|R
5000|$|After a {{recording}} audition with Joe Meek, <b>the</b> <b>Whirlwinds</b> changed their {{name to the}} Saxons and dyed their hair blond.

25|$|In 1964, Monte Hellman and Jack Nicholson {{had made}} two films together, Back Door to Hell and Flight to Fury, which were {{produced}} by Roger Corman and filmed back-to-back in the Philippines. After completing the films, {{the director and}} actor wrote a screenplay called Epitaph and presented it to Corman to produce. Corman did not care for the script but asked if the two {{would be willing to}} do a western for him instead. When they expressed an interest, Corman further suggested that they film two westerns, {{in a manner similar to}} the Philippine-shot movies they had just finished. They agreed and, while Nicholson started working on the script for Ride in <b>the</b> <b>Whirlwind,</b> Hellman asked their mutual friend Carole Eastman to write The Shooting.|$|E
25|$|The WB-2 Columbia was {{introduced}} at the 1926 National Air Races flown by Lieut C.C. Champion, where it won both efficiency records. Wright Aeronautical chose {{to continue to}} develop <b>the</b> <b>Whirlwind</b> engine, but discontinue aircraft operations to avoid competition in profitable engine sales with rival aircraft manufacturers. Bellanca left Wright Aeronautical, with {{the rights to the}} WB-2, and the WB-2 prototype purchased for $15,500 and formed a new interest, Columbia Aircraft Company, with the investor Charles Levine. Levine became a millionaire at the young age of 28 by reselling surplus armaments to the United States government. When partnering with Bellanca, he had plans to put the WB-2 in production. The plans never came through, and the aircraft would not see production until Bellanca manufactured an updated version with his own company later in 1928.|$|E
25|$|The Welkin {{required}} a sophisticated electrical system. This was to minimise {{the number of}} seals and points of entry in the cockpit for the controls and instrumentation. It took an electrician experienced in {{the features of the}} Welkin four hours to undertake a pre-flight check of this system. The wings were so large that the high lift Fowler flaps of <b>the</b> <b>Whirlwind</b> were not needed, and were replaced by a simple split flap. The extra wing area also required more stability, so the tail was lengthened to provide a longer moment arm. The armament − four Hispano 20 mm cannon − was the same as the Whirlwind's, but the Welkin carried the guns in a tray in its belly, which facilitated loading. In that position, muzzle flash was also less likely to dazzle the pilot.|$|E
