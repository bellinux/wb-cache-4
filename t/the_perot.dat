500|$|In 1995, {{industrialist}} Ross Perot, who {{had received}} 18.9 {{percent of the vote}} during his Independent 1992 run for president, formed the Reform Party of the United States of America. Though Perot won the party's 1996 nomination and garnered 8.4 percent of the popular vote, rifts had begun forming within the party. [...] Former Colorado Governor Richard Lamm, who unsuccessfully challenged Perot for the 1996 presidential nomination, accused Perot of using the party as a personal vehicle, and broke off with his supporters to form a new party. In 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura was elected Governor of Minnesota {{as a member of the}} Reform Party—the party's most significant victory—but Perot and his followers were not receptive to Ventura and his political allies. <b>The</b> <b>Perot</b> faction adamantly, though unsuccessfully, attempted to prevent the election of Ventura supporter Jack Gargan as party chairman in 1999 when Perot backer Russ Verney chose not to stand for re-election for his term ending January 1, 2000.

500|$|Released in 1972, The Legend of Boggy Creek premiered at {{what was}} later called <b>the</b> <b>Perot</b> Theatre, where lines {{stretched}} around the block to see it.

Houck, owner of the independent distribution company Howco, who paid Pierce $1.29 million for a 50 percent interest in the film. Pierce and Houck signed with American International Pictures for foreign and television distribution. It became a hit at drive-in movie theaters, eventually gaining a cult status and bringing Pierce a modicum of fame.

At the time of the film's release, Pierce incorrectly predicted to newspapers that it would win several Academy Awards. Several similarly-styled films about strange and allegedly true phenomena were released in subsequent years due to success of The Legend of Boggy Creek. Julius E.

500|$|Following <b>the</b> debates, <b>Perot</b> did not {{campaign}} {{and was not}} seen on television until {{later in the week}} when ABC aired a 30-minute sequel to an autobiographical infomercial shown on October 17. <b>The</b> spot cost <b>Perot</b> $370,000. CBS aired an infomercial on October 24 entitled <b>The</b> Ross <b>Perot</b> Nobody Knows, and two days later another was shown on ABC, preceding the kickoff of Monday Night Football, which cost $940,000. Perot hoped to better explain his earlier exit as Election Day neared. Reports circulated that a security official from the campaign had contacted the Dallas Police in August to urge them to perform a sting operation targeting Bush campaign adviser James Oberwetter, in response to allegations that Republicans planned to wiretap Perot's office. Perot claimed during an interview with 60 Minutes that [...] "Republican operatives" [...] also threatened to disrupt his daughter's wedding, which forced him to withdraw in July. He reported the story to the FBI, but no evidence of any wrongdoing was found. The New York Times argued that the story could help Perot with voters and his overall image by presenting him as a man [...] "who was willing to give up his goal to protect his family"; nevertheless, his lack of evidence drew criticism.|$|R
500|$|In July, some of Perot's past actions, {{including}} a private {{investigation of the}} Bush family in the late 1980s, circulated in the media, causing frustration for <b>the</b> campaign. <b>Perot</b> blamed <b>the</b> reports on a [...] "Republican research team" [...] and claimed that he was warned that since {{he had such a}} [...] "clean record they have got to try to redefine you and destroy you". Campaign officials tried {{to come up with a}} new strategy to combat the negative press, and to end Perot's use of generalizations on <b>the</b> issues. <b>Perot</b> sought National Institutes of Health head Dr. Bernadine Healy as his running mate, but she declined. Meanwhile, Perot faced obstacles on the campaign trail. During an Olympia rally, he was approached by a gay rights group, demanding that he address AIDS and gay rights; he soon flipped on the issue and stated that he would allow gays to serve in the military and in his cabinet. During an address to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Perot faced his toughest demographic, and made the gaffe of referring to African Americans as [...] "you people". It was later revealed that Perot did not want to appear at the meeting or any other forum without his supporters. Press consultant Squires had written a speech for <b>Perot</b> for <b>the</b> occasion, but he instead used his own. After <b>the</b> speech, <b>Perot</b> was concerned that members of the New Black Panther Party were plotting his assassination.|$|R
500|$|Perot {{participated in}} the first of three presidential debates for the 1992 election, on October 11 in Clayton, Missouri, along with George Bush and Bill Clinton. It {{was the first time that}} a third party {{candidate}} was involved in a national televised debate since John B. Anderson in 1980, and was the first presidential debate to ever feature three candidates. During the event, Perot discussed a wide range of issues including the budget deficit, education and drug use, and proclaimed that as president, he would eliminate the influence of lobbyists. He also had a few memorable quips. When asked to address detractors' criticism of his lack of government experience, he remarked: [...] "Well, they've got a point. I don't have any experience running up a $4 trillion debt." [...] When discussing what would happen if one of his opponents won, he commented: [...] "then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do. I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music here tonight." [...] After the debate, three out of four polls declared Perot as the winner. The average of all four showed Perot at 37% followed by Clinton with 30% and Bush with 18%, but election polls still showed Perot in third with 14%, far behind both Bush and Clinton. His running mate, James Stockdale, participated in a Vice Presidential debate in Atlanta, with fellow Vice Presidential nominee Al Gore and Vice President Dan Quayle. Largely unknown to the general public, Stockdale memorably opened the debate by unexpectedly asking the philosophical question, [...] "Who am I? Why am I here?" [...] He was unprepared to deal with some of the substantive issues raised, and his struggling performance may have damaged <b>the</b> <b>Perot</b> campaign.|$|E
500|$|Despite Trump's efforts, the {{conflict}} within the Reform Party escalated. A special Reform Party meeting was planned for Nashville at which <b>the</b> <b>Perot</b> faction {{was expected to}} vacate the national chairmanship of Ventura-ally Jack Gargan. Both Trump and Ventura expressed disgust with the national party. [...] Ventura desired to disassociate the Minnesota Reform Party from the national party. [...] An unnamed official within the party told the AP that Ventura and Trump discussed a scenario where Ventura would run as the presidential nominee of the disaffiliated party with Trump as his running mate. [...] The chairman of the Minnesota Reform Party denied Ventura {{would be part of}} any presidential ticket. After privately notifying Trump of his intentions and seeking his blessing, Ventura held a press conference on February 12 and officially left the national Reform Party, remaining a member of his state party, which he urged to disaffiliate and return to its original name, the Independence Party of Minnesota. [...] He voiced dissatisfaction with the presidential contest, explaining that Pat Buchanan was running [...] "virtually unopposed" [...] and receiving support from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke; something with which Ventura could not associate. [...] Ventura invited Trump to run for the presidential nomination of the Independence Party, which Ventura believed could become a national entity. [...] At the party's next meeting, it disaffiliated. [...] Trump considered Ventura's invitation but had concerns, particularly the question of whether other state parties would affiliate with the new party. [...] Minnesota political scientist Steve Schier doubted the party could become a national entity, arguing that it was far too small to make an impact on the national level. [...] Ventura's move came just ahead of the Nashville meeting where, with the rationale of failing to [...] "faithfully perform and execute the duties of his office," [...] Gargan was removed by a 109 to 31 committee vote. The chaotic meeting, dominated by Perot-faction members, featured shoving matches and physical squabbles as the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department intervened to restore order. [...] Gargan charged that the meeting was illegal due to insufficient notice, though a quorum was present.|$|E

While many disaffected conservatives may have voted for Ross Perot to protest Bush's tax increase, further examination of <b>the</b> <b>Perot</b> vote in the Election Night exit polls not only showed that Perot siphoned votes nearly equally among Bush and Clinton, but roughly two-thirds of those voters who cited Bush's broken [...] "No New Taxes" [...] pledge as [...] "very important" [...] (25%) [...] voted for Bill Clinton. The voting numbers reveal that to win the electoral vote Bush would have had to win 10 of the 11 states Clinton won by less than five percentage points. For Bush to earn a majority of the popular vote, he would have needed 12.2% of Perot's 18.9% of the vote, 65% of Perot's support base. State exit polls suggested that Perot did not alter the electoral college count, except potentially in one state (Ohio), which nonetheless showed a result in the margin of error. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. NAFTA played a role in Perot's support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot-button social issues.|$|E
