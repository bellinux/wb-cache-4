50|$|This is <b>the</b> first <b>Super</b> <b>Bowl</b> matchup {{in which}} both teams had a first-round bye since <b>Super</b> <b>Bowl</b> XXXIX.

50|$|<b>The</b> Colts' <b>Super</b> <b>Bowl</b> XLI {{victory in}} 2006 is <b>the</b> only <b>Super</b> <b>Bowl</b> win from <b>the</b> AFC South to date, and the {{division}} owns <b>the</b> longest active <b>Super</b> <b>Bowl</b> victory drought. <b>The</b> next ten <b>Super</b> <b>Bowls</b> were won {{by at least}} one team in the other seven divisions, including seven victories from seven divisions from 2009 to 2015.|$|R

Although Payton's offensive prowess had assisted the Bears throughout the 1985 season, he did not score any touchdowns in the postseason and the New England Patriots prevented him from reaching the end zone in <b>the</b> <b>Super</b> <b>Bowl.</b> According to quarterback Jim McMahon, he was targeted by two or three defenders on every play, and others stated that Payton's mere presence allowed others to shine, given that at least 2 people were targeting Payton on every play. In a later interview, Ditka stated that one of his major regrets was Payton's lack of a touchdown in <b>the</b> <b>Super</b> <b>Bowl.</b>|$|E
