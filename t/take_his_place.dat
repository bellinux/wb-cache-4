5|$|As {{the teams}} {{prepared}} to leave their dressing rooms, Manchester City deliberately delayed their exit by a short period to play on any nerves the Leicester City players may have had. Manchester City coach Malcolm Allison was not permitted to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place</b> on the bench, as he was serving a touchline ban. Instead, he had {{to sit in the}} stand behind the dugout. Before kick-off, the players were introduced to the guest of honour, Princess Anne.|$|E

5|$|In February 1818, {{during his}} last term at Oxford, and again {{following}} his father's wishes, he became Member of Parliament (MP) for Marlborough, a pocket borough owned by his cousin Charles, Earl of Ailesbury.

5|$|It was Geoffrey Barrow's belief, {{supported}} by Donald Watt, that their decision {{was the result}} of pressure from the new Scottish king, Robert de Brus, who may have valued Balmyle's experience and trusted his political record. The usual secular patron of the diocese was the Mormaer of Strathearn, but the incumbent Maol Íosa III was at that stage a prisoner-exile at Rochester in England, thus allowing Robert to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nathan {{earned his}} first save at Target Field on April 8, 2011. He emptied the {{container}} of dirt {{he took from}} the Metrodome on the mound at Target Field before pitching. On April 18, Nathan was replaced at closer by Matt Capps after going 3 for 5 in save opportunities. On May 28, 2011, Nathan {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list with a right flexor muscle strain. Chuck James was called up to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
5|$|The part became Hordern's first paid role as {{an actor}} for a theatre company. The play was an instant hit and ran at the People's Theatre in Mile End for two weeks. It also starred the English actor Stephen Murray in the title role, but he became contractually obliged {{elsewhere}} {{towards the end of}} the run. This allowed Hordern to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place</b> for which Daltry paid Hordern an extra £1 a week.|$|E

5|$|When Lounsberry {{learned that}} a {{military}} column (including the 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment commanded by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer) would soon leave Fort Abraham Lincoln for the Montana Territory, he agreed to accompany Custer and provide news coverage. However, {{at the last minute}} Lounsberry's wife fell ill, so the editor asked Kellogg to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place.</b> Lounsberry expected Kellogg would cover nothing more than a sensational military victory.|$|E
5|$|Drexler {{retired after}} the season, and the Rockets traded {{to bring in}} Scottie Pippen to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place.</b> In the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Rockets lost to the Lakers {{in the first round}} of the playoffs. After the 1999 draft, the Rockets traded for the second overall pick Steve Francis from the Vancouver Grizzlies, in {{exchange}} for four players and a first-round draft pick. However, after Houston traded a discontented Pippen to Portland, and Barkley suffered a career-ending injury, the rebuilt Rockets went 34–48 and missed the playoffs, for only the second time in 15 years.|$|E

5|$|In December 1943 a {{judge was}} taken ill, and Denning {{was asked to}} <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place</b> as a Commissioner of Assize. This was {{regarded}} as a 'trial' for membership of the judiciary, and Denning was appointed Recorder of Plymouth on 17 February 1944. On 6 March 1944, while arguing a case in the House of Lords, Denning was taken aside by the Lord Chancellor and told that he wanted Denning to become a judge at the High Court of Justice in the Probate, Admiralty and Divorce Division. Denning accepted, and the announcement was made before the conclusion of the trial.|$|E

5|$|Rutherford {{was born}} on November 8, 1869 to James Calvin Rutherford and Leonora Strickland and raised in near-poverty in a Baptist farm family. Some sources list his place of birth as Boonville, Missouri, but {{according}} to his death certificate {{he was born in}} Versailles, Missouri. Rutherford developed an interest in law from the age of 16. Although his father discouraged this interest, he allowed Rutherford to go to college under the condition that he pay for a laborer to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place</b> on the family farm. Rutherford took out a loan and helped to pay for his law studies by working as a door-to-door encyclopedia salesman and court stenographer.|$|E

5|$|Smith's {{replacement}} was Ron Suart, {{who wanted}} Matthews {{to stay out}} wide, and did not value his contribution {{in the way that}} Smith had done. Suart limited Matthews to 19 league appearances in 1958–59. Matthews was then used just 15 times in 1959–60, as Suart signed Arthur Kaye to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place,</b> and local lad Steve Hill also vied for the outside-right position. He enjoyed more games in 1960–61, playing 27 league games as the club narrowly avoiding relegation by the odd point.|$|E
5|$|The 1997–98 {{season was}} marked by injuries, and the team {{finished}} 41–41 with the eighth seed in the Western Conference. Houston once again faced the Jazz, {{this time in the}} first round, and they lost the series 3–2. Drexler retired after the season, and the Rockets made another bold trade to bring in Scottie Pippen to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place.</b> In the strike-shortened 1998–99 season, the Rocket went 31–19, but lost to the Lakers in the first round 3–1 of the playoffs.|$|E

Upon maturation living with two wastrels, Simba is given some valuable perspective from his childhood friend, Nala, and his shaman, Rafiki, before returning to challenge Scar to end his tyranny and <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place</b> in the Circle of Life as the rightful King.|$|E

5|$|After the World Cup England {{lost the}} annual Home Championship to Scotland after a 3–2 defeat in April 1967, Charlton scored {{for the second}} {{successive}} international game running after also finding the net against Wales the previous November. He injured his foot during the game as he broke two sesamoid bones in his big toe. As his career went on he began to miss England games with niggling injuries {{so as to avoid}} friendly games in favour of playing important matches for Leeds; Brian Labone would <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place</b> in the England team during Charlton's absences. He was named in the squad for UEFA Euro 1968, but did not feature in either of England's games. He won five caps in 1969, helping England to a memorable 5–0 win over France and scoring in a 1–0 win over Portugal from a corner taken by his brother Bobby.|$|E
5|$|Between {{conventions}} in April 1775, Randolph, who {{was both}} the Speaker of the House of Burgesses and President of the Virginia Conventions, negotiated with Lord Dunmore for gunpowder {{removed from the}} Williamsburg arsenal to a British warship during the Gunpowder Incident, which was a confrontation between the Governor's forces and Virginia militia, led by Patrick Henry. The House of Burgesses was called back by Lord Dunmore one last time in June 1775 to address British Prime Minister Lord North's Conciliatory Resolution. Randolph, who was a delegate to the Continental Congress, returned to Williamsburg to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place</b> as Speaker. Randolph indicated that the resolution had not {{been sent to the}} Congress (it had instead been sent to each colony individually in an attempt to divide them and bypass the Continental Congress). The House of Burgesses rejected the proposal, which was also later rejected by the Continental Congress.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, when {{a scandal}} forced the {{original}} Republican nominee, Godlove Stein Orth, {{to drop out}} of the gubernatorial race, Harrison accepted the Republican Party's invitation to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place</b> on the ticket. Harrison centered his campaign on economic policy and favored deflating the national currency. He was ultimately defeated in a plurality by James D. Williams, losing by 5,084 votes out of a total 434,457 cast, but Harrison was able to build on his new prominence in state politics. When the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 reached Indianapolis, he gathered a citizen militia to make a show of support for owners and management, and helped to mediate an agreement between the workers and management and to prevent the strike from widening.|$|E
