5|$|Max bumps into Niall Rafferty (Barry Sloane) in {{the village}} and tells him that his wedding with Steph is back on. Niall is devastated but tries to remain {{composed}} in front of Max. Steph has big plans for her wedding day and it looks as if it’s getting out of control as Jack worries about how much it's going to cost, with Jack even suggesting to Frankie and Steph that he should call Johnno and ask him to contribute to the cost of the wedding, a suggestion that Steph and Frankie refute immediately on the basis that Johnno was never very good with money, and also that he was now married to Michelle and was therefore preoccupied with bringing up his new son Presley. With only 48 hours until their big day everything starts <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> and when Steph accidentally rips her wedding dress it's the final straw. A devastated Steph announces there's no way the wedding can go ahead on Thursday.|$|E

Despite Rusty James' desire to do so, The Motorcycle Boy implies {{that he has no}} interest in reviving any gang activity. Rusty James fools around with another girl and is dumped by Patty.|$|E

The Postal Service confiscates their recording equipment and send Alalia and Fratt away in despair. They are abducted by a group of barbarians: descendents of farmers, in a cargo cult based on relics of office material, bureaucracy and vague memories of European Union agricultural grants. Alalia and Fratt have to blast their way out and manage to escape before they end up as a sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the raid}} went well, and they met no {{resistance}} entering the town. They cut the telegraph wires and easily captured the armory, which was being defended {{by a single}} watchman. They next rounded up hostages from nearby farms, including Colonel Lewis Washington, great-grandnephew of George Washington. They also spread the news to the local slaves that their liberation was at hand. Things started <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> when an eastbound Baltimore & Ohio train approached the town. The train's baggage master tried to warn the passengers. Brown's men yelled for him to halt and then opened fire. The baggage master, Hayward Shepherd, became the first casualty of Brown's war against slavery. Ironically, Shepherd was a free black man. Two of the hostages' slaves also died in the raid. For some reason, after the shooting of Shepherd, Brown allowed the train to continue on its way.|$|E
25|$|A {{long time}} ago, {{there was a}} rich {{merchant}} and his beautiful wife who lived happily in a big house. Despite their good fortune, the couple didn't have any children. One day, they went together to a shrine and made an offering of twelve banana hands to a tree spirit. Not long thereafter the wife became pregnant and the rich man wished {{with all his might}} that the child would be a boy, but his wife gave birth to a girl. His wife, however, conceived again and again. She became pregnant twelve times and each time she had a daughter. By that time his business started <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> for him since the ships that took his goods to sell in another country were robbed several times. Finally the rich merchant ended up borrowing a lot of money from his friends trying to fix his business problems. Yet, no matter what he did, his family kept getting poorer.|$|E

25|$|But {{just as the}} war seemed {{decided in}} the allies' favour, things started <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong.</b> The Greek {{commander}} Michael Palaeologus alienated some of his allies by his arrogance, and this stalled the campaign as rebel Count Robert of Loritello refused to speak to him. Although the two were reconciled, the campaign {{lost some of its}} momentum. Worse was to come: Michael was soon recalled to Constantinople. Although his arrogance had slowed the campaign, he was a brilliant general in the field, and his loss was a major blow to the allied campaign. The turning point was the battle for Brindisi, where the Sicilians launched a major counterattack by both land and sea. At the approach of the enemy, the mercenaries who were serving in the allied armies demanded impossible increases in their pay; when these were refused, they deserted. Even the local barons started to melt away, and soon Adrian's Byzantine allies were left hopelessly outnumbered. The naval battle was decided in the Sicilians' favour, and the Byzantine commander was captured. The defeat at Brindisi {{put an end to the}} restored Byzantine reign in Italy, and by 1158 the Byzantine Army had left Italy.|$|E

Drake, who {{by this time}} was smoking what Kirby has described as [...] "unbelievable amounts" [...] of cannabis and exhibiting [...] "the first signs of psychosis", refused. Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs. His sister recalled: [...] "This was a very bad time. He {{once said to me}} that everything started <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> from [...] time on, and I think that was when things started to go wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Friedrich Schleiermacher wrote Speeches and The Christian Faith, proposing a theodicy which John Hick later {{identified}} as Irenaean in nature. Schleiermacher began his theodicy by asserting that God is omnipotent and benevolent and concluded that, because of this, [...] "God would create flawlessly". He proposed {{that it would}} be illogical for a perfect creation <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> (as Augustine had suggested) and that evil must have been created by God for a good reason. Schleiermacher conceived a perfect world to be one in which God's purposes can naturally be achieved, and will ultimately lead to dependence on God. He conceived sin as being an obstruction to humanity's dependence on God, arguing that it is almost inevitable, but citing Jesus {{as an example of a}} sinless man, whose consciousness of God was unobstructed. This theology led Schleiermacher to universalism, arguing that it is God's will for everyone to be saved and that no person could alter this.|$|E

500|$|Although Pasteur {{had little}} idea how his method worked, he tested it on a boy, Joseph Meister (1876–1940), who {{was brought to}} Pasteur by his mother on 6 July 1885. He was covered in bites, having been set upon by a mad dog. [...] Meister's mother begged Pasteur to help her son. Pasteur was a scientist, not a physician, and he {{was well aware of}} the {{consequences}} for him if things were <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong.</b> He nevertheless decided to help the boy and injected him with increasingly virulent rabid rabbit spinal tissue over the following 10days. Later Pasteur wrote, [...] "as the death of this child appeared inevitable, I decided, not without deep and severe unease... to try out on Joseph Meister the procedure, which had consistently worked on dogs". [...] Meister recovered and returned home with his mother on 27 July. Pasteur successfully treated a second boy in October that same year; Jean-Baptiste Jupille (1869–1923) was a 15-year-old shepherd boy who had been severely bitten as he tried to protect other children from a rabid dog. Pasteur's method of treatment [...] remained in use for over 50years.|$|E
500|$|Golder {{identified}} [...] "Esther’s scarily casual death" [...] {{as one of}} the gripping {{points of}} what he felt to be an underwhelming finale. The Daily Telegraphs Gavin Fuller referred to her exit as [...] "being a genuine, and saddening shock." [...] Jeffrey praised the character's death as a [...] "well-handled shocker", noting that all signs had indicated Rex would die instead. He felt it was [...] "cruel trick on the writers' part to off lovely Agent Drummond" [...] and [...] "all the crueler to keep viewings hanging until that first glimpse of her funeral." [...] He concluded by saying that [...] "this kind of emotional sucker-punch" [...] is something Torchwood has always excelled at. Neela Debnath of The Independent commented that her death was sad because the [...] "character went through so much" [...] and that [...] "there would have been room for more growth in subsequent series." [...] Conversely, Los Angeles Times correspondent Todd VanDerWerff opined that it was hard to invest in Esther, in addition to Rex and Oswald, and though her death was intended as the [...] "one big, emotional moment of the finale" [...] it came across to him as [...] "kind of a dud". He felt that throughout the fourth series Esther was used as [...] "simply a plot device, someone the writers used when they needed something <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> or when they needed the story to move in a certain direction." [...] Blair Marnell of CraveOnline also notes in his review of the series finale that [...] "Rex and Esther never really caught on as leading characters" [...] and felt {{that it would have been}} better had the characters departed in symmetry.|$|E

By the time Clara was four and a half, her father was out of work, and between 1905 and 1923, the family lived at 14 different addresses, but seldom outside Prospect Heights, with Clara's father often absent. [...] "I do not think my mother ever loved my father", she said. [...] "He knew it. And it made him very unhappy, for he worshiped her, always." ...|$|E

Needless to say, with Gaston on board, things start <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> and the train is soon speeding out of control, leaving Spirou and the train designer the task of sorting things out. The serial was broadcast on Belgian radio in 1961. It was later published in Spirou magazine in 1964 and as a book, but in text form with Franquin and Jidéhem contributing just a few illustrations.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the attack}} on the narrows on 18 March, the two ships formed the 2nd Sub Division of the First Division of the fleet. The First Division was first to enter the straits, bombarding the Turkish forts from long range. The next {{squadron}} of four French battleships then passed through the gaps in their line to bombard the forts from closer range. The attack began <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> when the French ships were withdrawing from the straits. The battleship [...] hit a mine and sank with the loss of most of her crew. Three of the British battleships involved were also hit, with two of them sinking. Agamemnon and Lord Nelson survived largely unscathed, although Agamemnon was hit by twelve 6in howitzer shells during the attack.|$|E
2500|$|In the Jubilee plan, the LCAs for 2nd Division were {{to touch}} down just before dawn. The {{lowering}} point for the landing ships was [...] from the shore. Here too was an added complication, because naval planners wished to avoid the danger of flotillas colliding, becoming mixed together and confused. Therefore, zero hour was to be {{half an hour later}} for the inner than the outer beaches. At about 03:00 the LCAs were to be lowered from their landing ships. Once the LCAs were away, the ships would then sail back to England. The LCAs would make the two-hour journey to the shore. On 19 August, Nautical Twilight was 04:31 and sunrise 05:50. The four outer landings would touch down at 04:50 and the two inner flotillas of LCAs would touch down half an hour later. After disembarking their troops the LCAs, along with other landing craft types, were to withdraw away from the coast a few miles to an area protected by a smoke screen designated as the [...] "boat pool." [...] Here the landing craft would wait until ordered to re-embark the assault force {{at the end of the}} operation. The LCAs were to make their own way back.
