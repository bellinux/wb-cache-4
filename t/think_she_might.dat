500|$|In October 2012, it was {{confirmed}} by Daniel Kilkelly, a reporter for Digital Spy, that a new storyline would see Denise Fox (Diane Parish) and Fatboy spend the night together after he rescues her when she gets unwanted attention from a man. Norwood, who plays Fatboy, told Inside Soap, [...] "Right now, I don't think Fatboy is looking for love - but he's happy to be swept off his feet by Denise, who's this hot older woman he never imagined he could be with."Denise is a scorching woman - she's got a dynamite body and a beautiful smile. She's way out of his league, {{but there is a}} lot of chemistry between them. I think they'd make a really good couple. That would be cool. Fatboy may be young, but he's got an old soul and he's not just some young boy messing about. There is potential there if Denise could see it, but because of the age thing, I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> worry that people were saying things about her. Right now, she's just enjoying herself." [...] Norwood added that while the pair's relationship was sexual, a serious future for them could be possible.|$|E
60|$|JANE [also sneering]. I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have forewarned {{us of the}} honour {{in store}} for us.|$|E
60|$|That is what I {{look forward}} to with all my heart. I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> love her baby's father.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Willett <b>thinks</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> marry again," [...] said Mr. Truefitt, {{picking up}} his pipe and joining him. [...] "She’d make an {{excellent}} wife for anybody—anybody." ...|$|R
60|$|Without professing to be a {{judge of}} such matters, Superintendent Wade <b>thinks</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be {{described}} as a highly intelligent young woman, and of exceptionally prepossessing appearance.|$|R
5000|$|Once he gets {{over his}} shock, Ernie anticipates a quickie divorce, but Val <b>thinks</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> enjoy this new arrangement. Dan, {{fed up with}} both of them, decides he's not exactly broken-hearted, either.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you care? What {{does any}} man care? Oh! {{if she had}} only thought of the men as I <b>think,</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have been living now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{say that}} I am not angry with her. But I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> {{undertake}} {{to consider the}} question. You would like such a match, would you not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{one could}} have seen her face, I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have been nice-looking," [...] said Margaret. [...] "She had pretty golden curls, and merry blue eyes, rather like Harry's." ...|$|E
50|$|The singer Judy Ames's agent <b>thinks</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> {{get some}} {{favorable}} and helpful publicity {{if he can}} arrange for her {{to appear to be}} in a new romance with Buzz McAlister, a war hero.|$|R

50|$|Better {{birth control}} and legal {{abortion}} (to prevent unsafe abortions) have dramatically {{reduced the number of}} septic abortions. To decrease the risk further, a woman should be tested for common sexually transmitted infections in the first trimester of her pregnancy. If a woman <b>thinks</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be miscarrying or has miscarried, she should call her healthcare provider immediately.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear, {{that is a}} great pity! {{but such}} old friends as Lucy and me!--I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> see US; and I am sure we would not speak a word." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> {{have come}} here before she went there; {{especially}} as it wasn't anything out of her way. She couldn't have gone shorter than Bloomsbury Square, and Russell Square, and over Tottenham Court Road." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> {{have been}} mistrustful, mum,' {{returned}} Sloppy with submission, 'of standing in Our Johnny's light. There's {{so much trouble}} in illness, and so much expense, and she's seen such {{a lot of its}} being objected to.' ...|$|E

60|$|Now {{the queen}} {{was a very}} wise woman, so she pretended to <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have made a mistake, and only begged {{to be allowed to}} put a test to the two young men to prove which was the real prince.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} stir a step from this parlor! You've got back all your spirit, dear," [...] {{said the old}} wife, with young pride in her husband. [...] "But I must say that Ellen is putting more upon you than she has any right to. I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> tell him herself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a pity you did {{not remain}} there, and then, perhaps, {{you would not have}} gone to Ostend with my daughter. As it is, there she is.

6000|$|... “You <b>think</b> <b>she</b> really <b>might</b> {{have passed}} into some animal form?” asked Amanda. She {{was one of}} those who shape their {{opinions}} rather readily from the standpoint of those around them.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I shouldn't; I hate boys!" [...] said Nan fiercely, for {{her hand}} still smarted, and <b>she</b> began to <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have shown her courage in some wiser way.|$|R
5000|$|Akira's older brother, {{who attends}} college.

6000|$|Captain Asher, {{wearing a}} good coat and hat, {{relieved}} old Jane at her post, and waited {{and waited for}} Olive to come back. He did not for a moment <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> return by the shunpike, for that was a rough road, not fit for a bicycle. And if she passed this way once, why should she object to doing it again? ...|$|E
60|$|Jeanie {{found with}} {{pleasure}} {{that it was}} not above a musket-shot from the Manse; for it had been a bar to her happiness to <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be obliged to reside at a distance from her father, and she was aware that there were strong objections to his actually living in the same house with Butler. But this brief distance was the very thing which she could have wished.|$|E
60|$|THE GENERAL. Tricks! Ha! Well, I'll try {{to break}} myself of it; but I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> bear with me in a little thing like that. She knows that her name sticks in my throat. Better call her your sister than try to call her L-- [he almost breaks down] L-- well, call her by her name and {{make a fool of}} myself by crying. [He sits down at the near end of the table].|$|E
5000|$|Juanico was {{surprised}} when she heard about her former boyfriend's prescription drug abuse. [...] "He never drank or did drugs when I was around him," [...] <b>she</b> says. <b>She</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have prevented Elvis from becoming dependent on drugs when they had stayed together. [...] "When Elvis died, I felt guilty. I've {{never been able to}} understand how he could be surrounded with so many people who supposedly loved him and yet they allowed him to do that to himself." ...|$|R

6000|$|They had {{of course}} {{immediately}} spoken of Catherine. [...] "Did she {{send me a}} message, or--or anything?" [...] Morris asked. He appeared to <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have sent him a trinket or a lock of her hair.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ma says chits {{and jewels}} have no {{business}} together,' pursued Georgiana, 'and that's the reason why I have no trinkets except this, but I suppose my aunt Hawkinson was of a different opinion, because she left me this, though I used to <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> {{just as well have}} buried it, for it's always kept in jewellers' cotton. However, here it is, I am thankful to say, and of use at last, and you'll sell it, dear Sophronia, and buy things with it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't say that. You {{were very}} naughty, {{and it is}} hard to forgive the loss of her {{precious}} little book, but I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> do it now, and I guess she will, if you try her at the right minute," [...] said Meg. [...] "Go after them. Don't say anything till Jo has got good-natured with Laurie, than take a quiet minute and just kiss her, or do some kind thing, and I'm sure she'll be friends again with all her heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now, just listen. To begin with, there's mamma. What can I get for her? I {{have thought}} of ever so many things. She has three card cases, four gold thimbles, two or three gold chains, two writing desks of {{different}} patterns; and then as to rings, brooches, boxes, and all other things, I should <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be sick of the sight of them. I am sure I am," [...] said she, languidly gazing on her white and jewelled fingers.|$|E
