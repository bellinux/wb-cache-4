5|$|Type III toxin-antitoxin systems rely {{on direct}} {{interaction}} between a <b>toxic</b> protein and an RNA antitoxin. The <b>toxic</b> {{effects of the}} protein are neutralised by the RNA gene. One example is the ToxIN system from the bacterial plant pathogen Erwinia carotovora. The <b>toxic</b> ToxN protein is approximately 170 amino acids long and {{has been shown to}} be <b>toxic</b> to E. coli. The <b>toxic</b> activity of ToxN is inhibited by ToxI RNA, an RNA with 5.5 direct repeats of a 36 nucleotide motif (AGGTGATTTGCTACCTTTAAGTGCAGCTAGAAATTC). Crystallographic analysis of ToxIN has found that ToxN inhibition requires the formation of a trimeric ToxIN complex, whereby three ToxI monomers bind three ToxN monomers; the complex is held together by extensive protein-RNA interactions.|$|E

5|$|Venom that is <b>toxic</b> only to {{a certain}} taxon, or {{strongly}} <b>toxic</b> {{only to a}} certain taxon, {{has been found in}} a number of snakes, suggesting that these venoms have evolved via natural selection to subdue preferred prey species. Examples of this phenomenon have been found in the Mangrove snake Boiga dendrophila, which has a venom specifically <b>toxic</b> to birds, {{as well as in the}} genera Echis and Sistrurus, and in sea snakes. However, while several snakes possess venom that is highly <b>toxic</b> to their preferred prey species, the reverse correlation is not necessarily true: the venoms of several snakes are <b>toxic</b> to taxa that they do not consume in high proportions. Most snake venom, for instance, is highly <b>toxic</b> to lizards, although the proportion of lizard prey varies among snake species. This has led researchers to suggest that toxicity to a certain taxon is nearly independent of toxicity to another distantly related taxon.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to develop practical strategies and systems for the simultaneous control of SO{sub 2 }, NO{sub x}, particulate matter, and air <b>toxics</b> emissions from coal-fired boilers {{in such a way}} as to keep coal economically and environmentally competitive as a utility boiler fuel. Of particular interest is the control of air <b>toxics</b> emissions through the cost-effective use of conventional flue gas clean-up equipment such as electrostatic precipitators (ESP`s), fabric filters (baghouses), and SO{sub 2 } removal systems such as wet scrubbers and various clean coal technologies. This objective will be achieved through extensive development testing in Babcock and Wilcox`s state-of-the-art, 10 MW{sub e} equivalent, Clean Environment Development Facility (CEDF). The project has extended the capabilities of the CEDF to facilitate air <b>toxics</b> emissions control development work on backend flue gas cleanup equipment. Specifically, an ESP, a baghouse, and a wet scrubber for SO{sub 2 } (and air <b>toxics)</b> control were added [...] all designed to yield air <b>toxics</b> emissions data under controlled conditions, and with proven predictability to commercial systems. The specific objectives of the project are to: measure and understand production and partitioning of air <b>toxics</b> species in coal-fired power plant systems; optimize the air <b>toxics</b> removal performance of conventional flue gas cleanup systems; quantify the impacts of coal cleaning on air <b>toxics</b> emissions; identify and/or develop advanced air <b>toxics</b> emissions control concepts; develop and validate air <b>toxics</b> emissions measurement and monitoring techniques; and establish an air <b>toxics</b> data library to facilitate studies of the impacts of coal selection, coal cleaning, and emissions control strategies on the emissions of coal-fired power plants...|$|R

5|$|Amanita ocreata {{is highly}} <b>toxic,</b> {{and has been}} {{responsible}} for mushroom poisonings in western North America, particularly in the spring. It contains highly <b>toxic</b> amatoxins, as well as phallotoxins, a feature shared with the closely related death cap (A. phalloides), half a cap of which can be enough to kill a human, and other species known as destroying angels. There is some evidence it may be the most <b>toxic</b> of all the North American phalloideae, as a higher proportion of people consuming it had organ damage and 40% perished.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Criteria {{pollutants}} {{have been}} associated with exacerbation of children's asthma, but the role of air <b>toxics</b> in relation to asthma is less clear. Our objective was to evaluate whether exposure to outdoor air <b>toxics</b> in early childhood increased asthma risk or severity. METHODS: Air <b>toxics</b> exposure was estimated using the 2002 National Air <b>toxics</b> Assessment (NATA) and linked to longitudinal data (n= 6950) from a representative sample of US children born in 2001 and followed through kindergarten-age in the Early Child Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B). RESULTS: Overall, 17. 7 % of 5. 5 year-olds had ever been told by a healthcare professional they had asthma, and 6. 8 % had been hospitalized or visited an emergency room for an asthma attack. Higher rates of asthma were observed among boys (20. 1 %), low-income (24. 8 %), and non-Hispanic black children (30. 0 %) (p≤ 0. 05). Air <b>toxics</b> exposure was greater for minority race/ethnicity (p 0. 05). In adjusted logistic regression models, children exposed to the highest respiratory hazard index were not more likely to have asthma compared to those exposed to the lowest respiratory hazard index of total, onroad sources, or diesel PM. CONCLUSIONS: Early childhood exposure to outdoor air <b>toxics</b> in a national sample has not previously been studied relative to children's asthma. Within the constraints of the study, we found no evidence that early childhood exposure to outdoor air <b>toxics</b> increased risk for asthma. As has been previously reported, it is evident that there are environmental justice and disparity concerns for exposure to air <b>toxics</b> and asthma prevalence in US children...|$|R

40|$|Air <b>Toxics</b> are air {{pollutants}} that may pose {{a risk to}} human health or the environment. Hazardous {{air pollutants}} (HAPs) refer to the 188 air <b>toxics</b> that are subjected to regulations under section 112 (b) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD), {{in consultation with the}} Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), developed an Air <b>Toxics</b> Research Strategy (ATRS) and an Air <b>Toxics</b> Multi-Year Plan (MYP) to help focus and set research priorities. The ATRS identifies air <b>toxics</b> research needs, while the MYP presents ORD’s plan for addressing those needs in the 2003 - 2010 timeframe. This research provides scientific information and models to better understand the risks of air <b>toxics</b> and to help manage these risks. An EPA Science Advisory Board (SAB) Review Panel was convened to review the Research Strategy and Multi-Year Plan. The Panel responded to five specific charge questions related to the ATRS, and four charge questions concerning the MYP. The Panel’s review of these documents was significantly aided by interactive presentations and discussions with Office of Research and Development during its July 23 - 24, 2003 meeting. Detailed responses to each charge question are included in the Panel’s report. The following are the Panel’s key finding...|$|R

Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered <b>toxic,</b> but hafnium compounds should be handled as if they were <b>toxic</b> because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} <b>toxics</b> use reduction measurement among metal intensive manufacturers (SIC 34 - 39) located in Massachusetts. Of the 110 study fms chosen from a stratified random sample, {{less than half}} said they documented and measured their <b>toxics</b> use reduction progress. During on-site visits with twenty-eight of these fms, roughly half measured their progress accurately. <b>Toxics</b> use reduction measurement errors were most frequently due to one {{or a combination of}} five causes: use of poor normalization factors, inaccurate math calculations, materials accounting mistakes, incorrect chemical balances, and poor production unit definitions. In reconciling these errors, chemical input data was found to be more accurate than byproduct and emission data. Using chemical input data, the study documented over 2. 4 million pounds of <b>toxics</b> use reduction at 28 metal-intensive fms. To adjust reductions to the level of business activity, linear regression techniques were used to choose normalization measures which correlated with chemical use.
