The band's blue-blazered appeal, however, started to slip after 2009's overly serious concept album Tonight: Franz Ferdinand. Four years later, the zeitgeist may prefer its rock stars with suspenders and banjos, but Franz Ferdinand's Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action is an unapologetically swaggering disco-rock album <b>that</b> <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> overstay its welcome.|$|E

Phyllis Nagy's screenplay emphasises their steeliness and self-reliance. In sly and subversive fashion, Haynes is laying bare the tensions in a society <b>that</b> <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> acknowledge 'difference' of any sort." [...] Andrew O'Hehir of Salon wrote: [...] "From its opening shots of the autumnal, rain-swept streets of New York sometime {{in the middle of}} the last century, director Todd Haynes’ magnificent new film [...] "Carol" [...] establishes a mood of mournful romance, half nostalgic and half ominous, that never lets go." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star said: [...] "Everything clicks into place for this gorgeous achievement. Cinematographer Ed Lachman shot on Super 16 mm film to achieve era-specific muted colours and softer textures. Precise production design and a palette steeped in shades of green and red (appropriate to the Yuletide setting) make watching it seem like stepping inside an Edward Hopper painting." [...] Mark Kermode wrote in The Guardian: [...] "This superb adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's 1952 novel The Price of Salt doesn't put a foot wrong. From Phyllis Nagy's alluringly uncluttered script to Cate Blanchett's sturdily tremulous performance as a society woman with everything to lose, this brilliantly captures the thrills, tears and fears of forbidden love." ...|$|E

500|$|Peter Travers of Rolling Stone {{writes that}} the film is deeper than its predecessor, with a [...] "deft" [...] script <b>that</b> <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> scrutinize the Joker with popular psychology, instead pulling the viewer in with an {{examination}} of Bruce Wayne's psyche. Travers praised all the cast, saying each brings his or her [...] "'A' game" [...] to the film. He says Bale is [...] "electrifying," [...] evoking Al Pacino in The Godfather Part II, that Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent is [...] "scarily moving", and that Oldman [...] "is so skilled that he makes virtue exciting as Jim Gordon". Travers says Ledger moves the Joker away from Jack Nicholson's interpretation into darker territory, and expresses his support for any potential campaign to have Ledger nominated for an Academy Award, Travers says that the filmmakers move the film away from comic book cinema and closer to being a genuine work of art, citing Nolan's direction and the [...] "gritty reality" [...] of Wally Pfister's cinematography as helping to create a universe that has something [...] "raw and elemental" [...] at work within it. In particular, he cites Nolan's action choreography in the IMAX-tailored heist sequence as rivaling that of Heat (1995). Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Pitched at the divide between art and industry, poetry and entertainment, it goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind." [...] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "Every great hero needs a great villain. And in 2008, Christian Bale's Batman found his in Heath Ledger's demented dervish, the Joker." [...] BBC critic Mark Kermode, in a positive review, said that Ledger is [...] "very, very good" [...] but that Oldman's turn is [...] "the best performance in the film, by a mile"; Kermode felt Oldman was deserving of an Oscar nomination.|$|E

Moreover, like communism, capitalism is based on an essential egalitarianism <b>that</b> <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> distinguish between one consumer's dollar and another. The reductionism and egalitarianism inherent in capitalism explains its destructive impact on social institutions.

[...] The two poems offer two extreme views of facing death, each one which balances the other when they are read together− clearly one of Tennyson's original intentions when he first drafted them in 1833. Nevertheless, reading 'Tithonus' purely as a pendant to 'Ulysses' has led to unnecessarily reductive readings of both poems." ...|$|E

He takes on the Newtonian idea of the independent observer standing outside of time and space, addresses the skepticism of David Hume, rejects the position of Kant, and attacks speculations about parallel universes of contemporary cosmology. At stake is the laying of the foundations for a view of the world and causality that is open to all possibilities; that is not a closed system of options in which our future is governed by deterministic laws and typologies.
