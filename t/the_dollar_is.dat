2500|$|Today, {{like the}} {{currency}} of most nations, <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>is</b> fiat money, unbacked by any physical asset.

Consequently, some proponents of the intrinsic theory of value believe that the near-zero marginal cost of production of the current fiat dollar detracts from its attractiveness as a medium of exchange and store of value because a fiat currency without a marginal cost of production is easier to debase via overproduction and the subsequent inflation of the money supply.|$|E

60|$|It isn't {{merely the}} American that adores the Almighty Dollar, {{it is the}} human race.

6000|$|When Alma {{returned}} to the room, Colonel Woodburn was saying to Mrs. Leighton: [...] "I do not contend that it is impossible, madam, {{but it is very}} difficult in a thoroughly commercialized society, like yours, to have the feelings of a gentleman. How can a business man, whose prosperity, whose earthly salvation, necessarily lies in the adversity of some one else, be delicate and chivalrous, or even honest? If we could have had time to perfect our system at the South, to eliminate what was evil and develop what was good in it, we should have had a perfect system. But the virus of commercialism was in us, too; it forbade us {{to make the best of}} a divine institution, and tempted us to make the worst. Now the curse is on the whole country; <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>is</b> the measure of every value, the stamp of every success. What does not sell is a failure; and what sells succeeds." ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{customary}} {{to condemn}} the American as a materialist because of his worship of success. But indeed this very worship, like any worship, even devil-worship, proves him rather a mystic than a materialist. The Frenchman who retires from business when he has money enough to drink his wine and eat his omelette in peace might much more plausibly be called a materialist by {{those who do not}} prefer to call him a man of sense. But Americans do worship success in the abstract, as a sort of ideal vision. They follow success rather than money; they follow money rather than meat and drink. If their national life in one sense is a perpetual game of poker, they are playing excitedly for chips or counters as well as for coins. And by the ultimate test of material enjoyment, like the enjoyment of an omelette, even a coin is itself a counter. The Yankee cannot eat chips as the Frenchman can eat chipped potatoes; but neither can he swallow red cents as the Frenchman swallows red wine. Thus when people say of a Yankee that he worships the dollar, they pay a compliment to his fine spirituality more true and delicate than they imagine. <b>The</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>is</b> an idol because it is an image; but it is an image of success and not of enjoyment.|$|E

6000|$|We {{speak of}} [...] "bits" [...] of silver advisedly, for the Malagasy take the {{simplest}} and most literal way of making small change; they clip their dollars into little pieces of various sizes, and therewith transact the business that in other lands is settled with pence. As these clippings are not very accurate, however, they weigh the pieces, and for this purpose every one carries about with him a tiny pair of scales in his waist-cloth. These dollars were all foreign coins, for the Malagasy at that time had, (and we believe still have), no native coinage. All silver that comes to their net is considered good fish. The standard coin is the Spanish dollar, but one will find every variety of European and American money in circulation among them. The method of clipping and weighing the small change might be thought somewhat cumbrous in European markets, for <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>is</b> cut up into eight sikajy, (each about sixpence); the sikajy into nine eranambatra, and each eranambatra into ten vary-venty, each of which last is about {{the weight of a}} plump grain of rice. Four weights, marked with a government stamp, are used in weighing the money. These weights are equal, respectively, to about a half-a-dollar, a quarter-dollar, sixpence, and fourpence. Other amounts are obtained by varying these in the opposite scales and adding grains of rice. But all this forms no difficulty in Madagascar. Like most Easterns the natives there dearly love to haggle and prolong a bargain--as our travellers found to their amusement that day; for not only were the principals vociferous in their disputatious, but the bystanders entered into the spirit of the thing and volunteered their opinions! ...|$|E

I wish it were in refined taste to apply a rudely and ruggedly descriptive epithet to that literary slush-bucket, so as to give one an accurate idea of what it is like.

6000|$|Another of {{the many}} sins justly charged against the [...] "kings of finance" [...] was this: They would buy {{properties}} worth, say, ten millions of [...] "dollars" [...] (the value of <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>is</b> now unknown) and issue stock upon it to the face value of, say, fifty millions. This their clamorous critics called [...] "creating" [...] for themselves forty millions of dollars. They created nothing; the stock had no dishonest value unless sold, and even at the most corrupt period of the government nobody was compelled by law to buy. In nine cases in ten the person who bought did so in the hope and expectation of getting much for little and something for nothing. The buyer was {{no better than the}} seller. He was a gambler. He [...] "played against the game of the man who kept the table" [...] (as the phrase went), and naturally he lost. Naturally, too, he cried out, but his lamentations, though echoed shrilly by the demagogues, seem to have been unavailing. Even the rudimentary intelligence of that primitive people discerned the impracticability of laws forbidding the seller to set his own price on the thing he would sell and declare it worth that price. Then, as now, nobody had to believe him. Of the few who bought these [...] "watered" [...] stocks in good faith as an investment in the honest hope of dividends it seems sufficient to say, in the words of an ancient Roman, [...] "Against stupidity the gods themselves are powerless." [...] Laws that would adequately protect the foolish from the consequence of their folly would put an end to all commerce. The sin of [...] "over-capitalization" [...] differed in magnitude only, not in kind, from the daily practice of every salesman in every shop. Nevertheless, the popular fury that it aroused must be reckoned among the main causes contributory to the savage insurrections that accomplished the downfall of the republic.|$|E
