25|$|In birds, whose cells contain microchromosomes, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that there was a correlation between the presence of mega-telomeres and the number of microchromosomes present in a species, such that bird genomes with large numbers of microchromosomes also possessed larger amounts of <b>telomeric</b> <b>DNA</b> sequence. It was thought that these telomeric sequences might protect genes on these tiny chromosomes from erosion during cell division. However, subsequent studies showed that mega-telomeres are not necessarily present in all species with microchromosomes, nor are they found on all microchromosomes within a cell. Mega-telomeres are also thought contribute to the high recombination rate of chicken microchromosomes. The longest mega-telomere in chickens is associated with the W (female) chromosome, suggesting that mega-telomeres may also affect sex chromosome organization and the generation of genetic variation.|$|E

In both tumor and yeast cells that lack telomerase, telomeres are maintained by an alternative recombination mechanism. By using an in vivo inducible Cre-loxP system to generate and trace the fate of marked telomeric DNA-containing rings, the efficiency of telomere-telomere recombination can be determined quantitatively. We show that the telomeric loci are the primary sites at which a marked <b>telomeric</b> ring-containing <b>DNA</b> is observed among wild-type and surviving cells lacking telomerase. Marked <b>telomeric</b> <b>DNAs</b> can be transferred to telomeres and form tandem arrays through Rad 52 -, Rad 50 -, and polymerase δ-mediated recombination.

We find that histone tails hyperacetylation favors nucleosome formation, in a similar extent for all the examined sequences. On the contrary, removal of histone terminal domains by selective trypsinization causes a decrease of nucleosome stability which is smaller for telomeres compared to the other sequences examined, suggesting that telomeric sequences have only minor interactions with histone tails. Micrococcal nuclease kinetics shows enhanced accessibility of acetylated nucleosomes formed both on telomeric and 'average' sequence DNAs.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{fraction of}} human cancer cells and immortalized cells maintain telomeres in a telomerase-independent manner called alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). It {{has been suggested}} that ALT involves homologous recombination that is expected to generate unique intermediate DNAs. However, the precise molecular mechanism of ALT is not known. To gain insight into how <b>telomeric</b> <b>DNAs</b> (T-DNAs) are maintained in ALT, we examined the physical structures of T-DNAs in ALT cells. We found abundant single-stranded regions in both G and C strands of T-DNAs. Moreover, two-dimensional gel electrophoreses and native in-gel hybridization analyses revealed novel ALT-specific single-stranded T-DNAs, in addition to previously reported t-circles. These newly identified ALT-specific T-DNAs include (i) the t-complex, which consists of highly branched T-DNAs with large numbers of internal single-stranded portions; (ii) ss-G, which consists of mostly linear single-G-strand T-DNAs; and (iii) ss-C, which consists of most likely circular single-C-strand T-DNAs. Cellular-DNA fractionation by the Hirt protocol revealed that t-circles and ss-G exist in ALT cells as extrachromosomal and chromatin-associated DNAs. We propose that such ALT-specific T-DNAs are produced by telomere metabolism specific to ALT, namely, homologous recombination and the rolling-circle replication mechanism...|$|R
50|$|The {{digestion}} of DNA {{into smaller}} fragments by restriction enzymes, separation of variable-sized DNA fragments via electrophoresis, and labeling of fragments containing <b>telomeric</b> <b>DNA</b> using a specific radio- or fluorescently-labeled probe are the essential steps completed within many molecular techniques. In many cases, the DNA fragments are transferred to distinctive membranes before labeling via blotting techniques (i.e. Southern blot). Specialized protocols {{have demonstrated the}} ability to isolate high molecular weight Class III <b>telomeric</b> <b>DNA</b> from Class I and II fragments as well as characterize the size ranges found within each class. The pattern of the telomeric fragments on the stained or labeled membrane is typically unique to the DNA sample (i.e. telomere arrays are rarely identical). Molecular weight markers are usually separated via electrophoresis through agarose gel along with genomic DNA fragments to aid in sizing telomeric arrays and identifying array inter- and intra- individual variability. Slot blot, however, is conducted without DNA fragmentation or separation, rather whole genomic DNA is used to quantify the total concentration of <b>telomeric</b> <b>DNA.</b> The flaw of this technique is {{that the size of}} the labelled DNA molecules cannot be identified. In slot blot (or dot blot), total genomic DNA is attached to a membrane and labeled with a telomere-probe that produces a sample-specific chemiluminescence signal, which is captured and quantified by fluorometer equipment and software. A known concentration standard must be labeled and quantified simultaneously in order to accurately determine the telomeric sequence concentration in the DNA samples.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of Q-FISH and PNAs, the classical technique for measuring telomere length was the use of Southern blots. In this method, genomic DNA is digested using restriction enzymes and separated by gel electrophoresis.

However, this method is only able to evaluate average telomere length in a cell population and the presence of interstitial telomeric sequences in the genome can yield inaccurate measurements.|$|E
50|$|Cells of {{the body}} don't {{normally}} {{have the ability to}} divide indefinitely. They have a limited number of divisions before the cells become unable to divide (senescence), or die (crisis). The cause of these barriers is primarily due to the DNA at the end of chromosomes, known as telomeres. <b>Telomeric</b> <b>DNA</b> shortens with every cell division, until it becomes so short it activates senescence, so the cell stops dividing. Cancer cells bypass this barrier by manipulating enzymes that increase the length of telomeres. Thus, they can divide indefinitely, without initiating senescence.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSeveral guanine-rich {{sequences}} {{exist in}} many important regions, such as telomeres, and these sequences can form quadruplex DNA structures. It was previously reported that 3 ′-guanines are mainly oxidized in the Tetrahymena and Oxytricha <b>telomeric</b> quadruplex <b>DNA,</b> d(TGGGGT) 4, and 5 ′-guanines are mainly oxidized {{in the human}} <b>telomeric</b> quadruplex <b>DNA,</b> d(TAGGGT) 4 T. We speculated that the differences in site reactivity between d(TGGGGT) 4 and d(TAGGGT) 4 T are induced by the localization of the HOMO. The HOMOs of the possible quadruplex structures were thus determined and {{the results showed that}} the HOMOs of d(TGGGGT) 4 + 3 K+ and d(TAGGGT) 4 T + 2 K+ localized at the 5 ′-guanine, and that the HOMO shifted from the 5 ′-guanine to the 3 ′-guanine by the addition of a 5 ′-capping cation. Furthermore, we determined the influence of the cation and demonstrated that localization of the HOMO at the G-quartet plane located immediately adjacent to the cation is disfavored. The calculated HOMO localization of d(TGGGGT) 4 + 4 K+ and d(TAGGGT) 4 T + 2 K+ matched the experimental results and suggest that d(TGGGGT) 4 contains a 5 ′-capping cation in solution...|$|R
40|$|In human cells, {{transfection}} of telomeric T 2 AG 3 repeats induces {{the formation}} of functional telomeres at previously interstitial sites. We report that telomere formation has stringent sequence requirements. While (T 2 AG 3) n telomere seeds formed telomeres in approximately 70 % of the transfected cells, five T 2 AG 3 -related heterologous <b>telomeric</b> <b>DNAs</b> seeded new telomeres in < 5 % of the transfectants. Telomere formation did not correlate with the ability of human telomerase to elongate telomeric sequences in vitro. Homologous recombination is probably also not involved because a (T 2 AG 3) n telomere seed with nontelomeric DNA at 160 -bp intervals formed new telomeres frequently. Instead, the sequence dependence of telomere formation matched the in vitro binding requirements for the mammalian T 2 AG 3 repeat binding factor (TRF). Human TRF failed to bind ineffective heterologous telomere seeds and had a 4 -fold lower affinity for (T 2 AG 5) 2 T 2 AG 3 repeats, which seeded telomeres with reduced frequency. The results suggest that telomere seeds interact with TRF and predict that mammalian artificial chromosomes will require wild-type telomeric repeats at, or near, their termini...|$|R
40|$|The telosome/shelterin, a six-protein complex {{formed by}} TRF 1, TRF 2, RAP 1, TIN 2, POT 1, and TPP 1, {{functions}} {{as the core}} of the telomere interactome, acting as the molecular platform for the assembly of higher order complexes and coordinating cross-talks between various protein subcomplexes. Within the telosome, there are two oligonucleotide- or oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold-containing proteins, TPP 1 and POT 1. They can form heterodimers that bind to the <b>telomeric</b> single-stranded <b>DNA,</b> an activity that is central for telomere end capping and telomerase recruitment. Through proteomic analyses, we found that in addition to POT 1, TPP 1 can associate with another OB fold-containing protein, OBFC 1 /AAF 44. The yeast homolog of OBFC 1 is Stn 1, which plays a critical role in telomere regulation. We show here that OBFC 1 /AAF 44 can localize to telomeres in human cells and bind to <b>telomeric</b> single-stranded <b>DNA</b> in vitro. Furthermore, overexpression of an OBFC 1 mutant resulted in elongated telomeres in human cells, implicating OBFC 1 /AAF 4 in telomere length regulation. Taken together, our studies suggest that OBFC 1 /AAF 44 represents a new player in the telomere interactome for telomere maintenance...|$|R
50|$|Cancer cells {{require a}} {{mechanism}} to maintain their <b>telomeric</b> <b>DNA</b> {{in order to continue}} dividing indefinitely (immortalization). A mechanism for telomere elongation or maintenance {{is one of the key}} steps in cellular immortalization and can be used as a diagnostic marker in the clinic. Telomerase, the enzyme complex responsible for elongating telomeres through the addition of telomere repeats to the ends of chromosomes, is activated in approximately 80% of tumors.

50|$|During {{chromosome}} replication, the {{enzymes that}} duplicate DNA cannot continue their duplication {{all the way}} to the end of a chromosome, so in each duplication the end of the chromosome is shortened (this is because the synthesis of Okazaki fragments requires RNA primers attaching ahead on the lagging strand). The telomeres are disposable buffers at the ends of chromosomes which are truncated during cell division; their presence protects the genes before them on the chromosome from being truncated instead. The telomeres themselves are protected by a complex of shelterin proteins, as well as by the RNA that <b>telomeric</b> <b>DNA</b> encodes (TERRA).|$|E
50|$|Shelterin (also called telosome) is {{a protein}} complex known to protect telomeres in many eukaryotes from DNA repair mechanisms, {{as well as}} {{regulate}} telomerase activity. In mammals and other eukaryotes, <b>telomeric</b> <b>DNA</b> consists of double- and single-stranded TTAGGG repeats and a single-stranded, G-rich overhang. Subunits of shelterin bind to these regions and induce {{the formation of a}} t-loop, a cap structure that deters DNA-damage-sensing machinery from mistakenly repairing telomeres. The absence of shelterin causes telomere uncapping and thereby activates damage-signaling pathways that may lead to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), homology directed repair (HDR), senescence, or apoptosis.|$|E
40|$|The G-quadruplex DNA is a four-stranded DNA {{structure}} {{that is highly}} susceptible to oxidation due to its G-rich sequence and its structure. Oxidative DNA base damages can be mutagenic or lethal to cells if they are left unrepaired. The base excision repair (BER) pathway is the predominant pathway for repair of oxidized DNA bases. DNA glycosylases are the first enzymes in BER and are responsible for removing base lesions from DNA. How DNA glycosylases remove base lesions from duplex and single-stranded DNA has been intensively studied, while how they act on G-quadruplex DNA remains to be explored. In Chapter II of this dissertation, we studied the glycosylase activity of the five mammalian DNA glycosylases (OGG 1, NTH 1, NEIL 1, NEIL 2 and mouse Neil 3) on G-quadruplex DNA formed by telomere sequences that contain a single base lesion. We found that telomeric sequences that contain thymine glycol (Tg), 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydroguanine (8 -oxoG), guanidinohydantoin (Gh) or spiroiminodihydantoin (Sp) all formed the basket form of an antiparallel G-quadruplex DNA structure in Na+ solution. We also showed that no glycosylase was able to remove 8 -oxoG from quadruplex DNA, while its further oxidation products, Sp and Gh, were good substrates for mNeil 3 and NEIL 1 in quadruplex DNA. In addition, mNeil 3 is the only enzyme that removes Tg from quadruplex DNA and the glycosylase strongly prefers Tg in the telomere sequence context in both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. In Chapter III, we extended our study to <b>telomeric</b> G-quadruplex <b>DNA</b> in K+ solution and we also studied quadruplex DNA formed by promoter sequences. We found that 8 -oxoG, Gh and Sp reduce the thermostability and alter the folding of <b>telomeric</b> quadruplex <b>DNA</b> in a location-dependent manner. Also, the NEIL 1 and NEIL 3 DNA glycosylases are able to remove hydantoin lesions {{but none of the}} glycosylases, including OGG 1, are able to remove 8 -oxoG from <b>telomeric</b> quadruplex <b>DNA</b> in K+ solution. Interestingly, NEIL 1 or NEIL 3 do not efficiently remove hydantoin lesions at the site that is most prone to oxidation in quadruplex DNA. However, hydantoin lesions at the same site in quadruplex DNA are removed much more rapidly by NEIL 1, NEIL 2 and NEIL 3, when an extra telomere TTAGGG repeat is added to the commonly studied four-repeat quadruplex DNA to make it a five-repeat telomere quadruplex DNA. We also show that APE 1 cleaves furan in selected positions in Na+-coordinated <b>telomeric</b> quadruplex <b>DNA</b> structures. We use promoter sequences of the VEGF and c-MYC genes as models to study promoter G-quadruplex DNA structures, and show that the NEIL glycosylases primarily remove Gh from Na+-coordinated antiparallel quadruplex DNA but not from K+-coordinated parallel quadruplex DNA containing VEGF or c-MYC promoter sequences. Taken together, our data show that the NEIL DNA glycosylases may be involved in both telomere maintenance and gene regulation...|$|R

Here we show that a specific functional interaction indeed exists among components of the two complexes. In particular, unlike RIF 2 deletion, the lack of Rif 1 is lethal for stn 1 DC cells and causes a dramatic reduction in viability of cdc 13 - 1 and cdc 13 - 5 mutants. This synthetic interaction between Rif 1 and the CST complex occurs independently of rif 1 D-induced alterations in telomere length. Both cdc 13 - 1 rif 1 D and cdc 13 - 5 rif 1 D cells display very high amounts of <b>telomeric</b> single-stranded <b>DNA</b> and DNA damage checkpoint activation, indicating that severe defects in telomere integrity cause their loss of viability. In agreement with this hypothesis, both DNA damage checkpoint activation and lethality in cdc 13 rif 1 D cells are partially counteracted {{by the lack of}} the Exo 1 nuclease, which is involved in <b>telomeric</b> single-stranded <b>DNA</b> generation. The functional interaction between Rif 1 and the CST complex is specific, because RIF 1 deletion does not enhance checkpoint activation in case of CST-independent telomere capping deficiencies, such as those caused by the absence of Yku or telomerase.

40|$|Telomeres are DNA-protein {{structures}} that protect eukaryotic chromosome ends from illegitimate recombination and degradation. Telomeres become shortened with each cell division unless telomerase, a reverse transcriptase, is activated. In addition to playing a protective role of chromosome ends, telomeres and telomere binding proteins are also essential for regulating telomere length and telomerase access. The mammalian protein POT 1 binds to <b>telomeric</b> single-stranded <b>DNA</b> (ssDNA), protecting chromosome ends from being detected as sites of DNA damage and negatively regulating telomere length. POT 1 {{is composed of}} an N-terminal ssDNA-binding domain and a C-terminal protein-interaction domain. With regard to the latter, POT 1 heterodimerizes with the protein TPP 1 to foster binding to telomeric ssDNA in vitro and binds the <b>telomeric</b> double-stranded <b>DNA</b> (dsDNA) binding protein TRF 2.

Using separation-of-function POT 1 mutants deficient in one of POT 1 's three functions, I found that binding to TRF 2 fosters robust loading of POT 1 onto telomeric chromatin and regulates telomere length, but is dispensable in the protection of telomeres. Although it remains unclear what role TPP 1 binding plays in telomere length regulation, I found that the telomeric ssDNA-binding activity and binding to TPP 1 are required in cis for POT 1 -mediated protection of telomeres, possibly by excluding RPA from telomeres.
