5|$|Lownds infuriated the Special Forces {{personnel}} {{even further}} when the indigenous survivors of Lang Vei, their families, civilian {{refugees from the}} area, and Laotian survivors from the camp at Ban Houei Sane arrived at the gate of KSCB. Lownds feared that NVA infiltrators were mixed up in the crowd of more than 6,000, and lacked sufficient resources to sustain them. Overnight, they were moved to a temporary position {{a short distance from}} the perimeter and from <b>there</b> <b>some</b> of the Laotians were eventually evacuated, although the majority turned around and walked back down Route 9 toward Laos.|$|E

5|$|The {{change in}} tactics {{appeared}} to be effective, as October state elections in Ohio and Indiana resulted in Republican victories there, discouraging Democrats about their chances the following month. Democratic party leaders had selected English as Hancock's running mate because of his popularity in Indiana. With their state-level defeat <b>there,</b> <b>some</b> talked of dropping English from the ticket, but he convinced them that the October losses owed more to local issues, and that the Democratic ticket could still carry Indiana, if not Ohio, in November.|$|E
5|$|The {{funds from}} the robbery were {{originally}} kept {{at the house of}} Stalin's friends in Tiflis, Mikha and Maro Bochoridze. The money was sewn into a mattress so that it could be moved and stored easily without arousing suspicion. The mattress was moved to another safe house, then later put on the director's couch at the Tiflis Meteorological Observatory, possibly because Stalin had worked <b>there.</b> <b>Some</b> sources claim that Stalin himself helped put the money in the observatory. The director stated that he never knew that the stolen money had been stored under his roof.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{according}} to agreement, the SPARS enlisted personnel received their indoctrination training {{on college campuses}} operated for such by the U.S. Navy. In March 1943, the USCG decided to establish its own training center for the indoctrination of enlisted recruits. The site selected was the Palm Beach Biltmore Hotel, Palm Beach, Florida. Beginning in late June, all enlisted personnel received their indoctrination and specialized training <b>there.</b> <b>Some</b> 70 percent of the enlisted women who received recruit training also received some specialized training. Yeoman and storekeepers represented the largest share, but many SPARS were {{given the opportunity to}} train in other fields. In January 1945, the training of enlisted personnel was transferred from Palm Beach to Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York.|$|E

5|$|Buoyed by this success, {{which was}} {{followed}} by a restoration of imperial control in much of Thrace as far as Philippopolis, Irene moved towards the restoration of the veneration of icons, which had been prohibited by Emperor Constantine V. A new ecumenical council was convened. Initially, in 786, it was held in the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, but the soldiers of the tagmata, founded by Constantine V and loyal to his iconoclastic policies, gathered outside in protest and forced the assembly to be broken up. In order to neutralize their reaction, Irene sent the tagmata to the army base of Malagina in Bithynia, allegedly in preparation for a campaign against the Arabs. <b>There,</b> <b>some</b> 1,500 of the soldiers were dismissed while Staurakios brought loyal thematic troops from Thrace to guard the capital. Irene then reconvened the council at Nicaea, after dismissing the most recalcitrant iconoclast bishops. Predictably, iconoclasm was overturned as a heresy, and the veneration of images was restored.|$|E

Though they feared {{they would be}} {{handed over to the}} Germans, the Italian commander of the camp promised them that this would never happen. On 14 March 1942, the Italians blockaded the camp and arrested the Jews that had been detained <b>there.</b> <b>Some</b> were handed over to the Germans and transported to the Sajmište concentration camp, near Belgrade, where they were killed. Others, together with Serbs, were taken to the camp in Berat, where they were detained until Italy's capitulation. It is estimated that as many as 500 Jews were interned in the camps in Berat, Krujë and Kavajë during the Italian occupation.|$|E

Ethan Allen went with a small company of Americans to collect Canadiens that Livingston had been recruiting, and take them to monitor Longueuil, the other major crossing point. Livingston had established a base at Point-Olivier, below Fort Chambly, another aging fort at the base of some rapids in the Richelieu River, and was urging his compatriots to join him <b>there.</b> <b>Some</b> Loyalists attempted to dissuade others from joining with Livingston; Livingston's supporters sometimes violently opposed attempts by Loyalists to organize, and Carleton did nothing at the time to assist the Loyalists outside the city.|$|E
5|$|Summer {{distribution}} of fin whales in the North Pacific is the immediate offshore waters from central Baja California to Japan {{and as far}} north as the Chukchi Sea bordering the Arctic Ocean. They occur in high densities in the northern Gulf of Alaska and southeastern Bering Sea between May and October, with some movement through the Aleutian passes {{into and out of the}} Bering Sea. Several whales tagged between November and January off southern California were killed in the summer off central California, Oregon, British Columbia, and in the Gulf of Alaska. Fin whales have been observed feeding 250 miles south of Hawaii in mid-May, and several winter sightings have been made <b>there.</b> <b>Some</b> researchers have suggested that the whales migrate into Hawaiian waters primarily in the autumn and winter.|$|E
