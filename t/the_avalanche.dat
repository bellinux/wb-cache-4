5|$|After {{almost two}} years, Ascent sold <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> and Nuggets to Wal-Mart heirs Bill and Nancy Laurie for $400million. However, {{a group of}} Ascent {{shareholders}} sued, claiming that the sale price was several million dollars too low. Ascent then agreed to sell <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> and Nuggets to Denver banking tycoon Donald Sturm for $461million.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> {{were forced}} to lose many of their key players {{in order to stay}} below the salary cap. Even with the loss of {{teammates}} Peter Forsberg and Adam Foote, Sakic still helped <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> get into the playoffs, where they eventually lost to the Anaheim Ducks in the conference semi-finals. In June 2006, Sakic signed a one-year, $5.75 million deal to keep him with <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> for the 2006–07 season. Upon the retirement of Steve Yzerman a month later, on July 3, 2006, Sakic became the League leader for most NHL career points scored among active players.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{departure}} of Roy, <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> hired Jared Bednar from the Calder Cup champions, the Lake Erie Monsters of the American Hockey League, as head coach. On December 10, 2016, <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> allowed 10 goals in a 10–1 loss to the Canadiens. <b>The</b> <b>Avalanche</b> closed out their season {{with a record of}} 22–56–4, resulting in a franchise-low 48 points and a last-place finish in the league; this was the worst record of any team in the NHL since the Atlanta Thrashers finished with a record of 14–61–7 and 39 points in the 1999–2000 season (which was their first season in the league).|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{durations}} of <b>the</b> <b>avalanches</b> in <b>the</b> maximal <b>avalanche</b> decomposition of <b>the</b> Bak-Sneppen evolution model. We show that all <b>the</b> <b>avalanches</b> in this maximal decomposition have infinite expectation, but only `barely', {{in the sense}} that if we made the appropriate threshold a tiny amount smaller (in a certain sense), then <b>the</b> <b>avalanches</b> would have finite expectation. The first of these results is somewhat surprising, since simulations suggest finite expectations...|$|R
50|$|In May 2017 <b>The</b> <b>Avalanches</b> curated <b>The</b> <b>Avalanches</b> - Since I Left You Block Party {{as part of}} Sydney's Vivid LIVE festival. Playing {{outdoors}} at the Sydney Opera House, <b>The</b> <b>Avalanches</b> headlined {{and were}} joined by 'special guests' DJ Shadow, Briggs, Sampa the Great, Jonti and DJ JNETT. While <b>The</b> <b>Avalanches</b> set was billed as Since I Left You being performed live in full at Vivid LIVE {{for the first time}} since 2001, the show drew criticism from some fans as they mostly played tracks from Wildflower.|$|R

5|$|For the 2007–08 season, <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> signed {{two free}} agents: defenseman Scott Hannan and left winger Ryan Smyth. These {{acquisitions}} filled the team's needs and {{were expected to}} help make an impact in the playoffs. With a 9–5 victory over the St. Louis Blues on December 9, 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> earned their 1,000th franchise victory. On February 25, 2008, unrestricted free agent Peter Forsberg signed with <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> {{for the remainder of}} the 2007–08 season. A day later, at the trade deadline, they re-acquired popular defenseman Adam Foote from the Columbus Blue Jackets as well as Ruslan Salei from the Florida Panthers. In the Western Conference Quarter-finals, Colorado beat the Minnesota Wild in six games. In the Western Conference Semi-finals, however, <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> were swept by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings.|$|E
5|$|In the 1996–97 season, Sakic only {{played in}} 65 games {{due to a}} lacerated calf, yet still managed to score 74 points as <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> earned their first Presidents' Trophy and third {{straight}} division title. He had another great playoff season with eight goals and 17 assists, and took <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> {{all the way to}} the conference finals, where they eventually lost to the Detroit Red Wings in six games. As a free agent during the summer of 1997, Sakic signed a three-year, $21 million offer sheet with the New York Rangers as a restricted free agent. Under the collective bargaining agreement at the time, <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> had one week to match the Rangers' offer or let go of Sakic. Colorado would match the offer, which instigated a salary raise for many NHL players.|$|E
5|$|In the 2009 off-season, <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> named Greg Sherman the new {{general manager}} and Joe Sacco the new head coach. The {{following}} month, top scorer Ryan Smyth {{was traded to the}} Los Angeles Kings and Joe Sakic, the only team captain the Avs had ever known, retired after 21 seasons in the NHL. The Avs named Adam Foote team captain to replace him. Sakic's jersey retirement ceremony took place on October 1, 2009, before the season opener at home against the San Jose Sharks in front of a sold out crowd where <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> won 5–2. <b>The</b> <b>Avalanche</b> started the season off strong until the Olympic break. Three Avs played in Vancouver: Paul Stastny for the United States, Ruslan Salei for Belarus and Peter Budaj for Slovakia. Following the Winter Olympics, the Avs struggled but eventually clinched a playoff spot with 95 points on the season, a 26-point improvement from the previous year's effort, and good enough for eighth place in the Western Conference. <b>The</b> <b>Avalanche</b> fell in the Western Conference Quarter-finals to the top-seeded San Jose Sharks in six games.|$|E
50|$|On 21 August 2012, a new track {{entitled}} 'A Cowboy Overflow of the Heart' {{was released}} by <b>The</b> <b>Avalanches</b> which features Berman reading a poem he composed over music by <b>The</b> <b>Avalanches.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{report on}} <b>the</b> Nuristan <b>avalanche</b> was {{released}} by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), providing details on <b>the</b> <b>avalanches</b> and <b>the</b> loss {{of life in the}} incident.

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> and the Red Wings was most intense from 1996 to 2002. During those seven seasons {{the two teams}} played five postseason series {{against each other in}} the Stanley Cup playoffs, with <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> winning three of the series (1995–96, 4–2; 1998–99, 4–2; 1999–2000, 4–1) and the Red Wings winning two of them (1996–97, 4–2; 2001–02, 4–3). During this time frame, these two teams {{combined}} for a total of five Stanley Cup championships in seven years, <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> winning twice (1995–96 and 2000–01) and the Red Wings winning three times (1996–97, 1997–98 and 2001–02). After 2002, the rivalry between the two teams began to cool down, and the two teams would not meet again in the playoffs until 2008, when the Red Wings swept <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> in the Western Conference Semi-finals and {{went on to win the}} Stanley Cup. The Red Wings moved to the Eastern Conference in 2013–14 season as part of the realignment which makes the two rivals only see each other twice a year.|$|E
5|$|After {{buying the}} team, COMSAT {{organized}} its Denver sports franchises under a separate subsidiary, Ascent Entertainment Group Inc., which {{went public in}} 1995, with 80% of its stock bought by COMSAT and the other 20% available on NASDAQ. The Colorado Avalanche played their first game in the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver (where the Denver Nuggets also played) on October 6, 1995, winning 3–2 against the Detroit Red Wings. Valeri Kamensky scored the first goal as <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche.</b> Led by captain Joe Sakic, forward Peter Forsberg and defenseman Adam Foote {{on the ice and}} Pierre Lacroix as the general manager and Marc Crawford as the head coach, <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> became stronger when All-Star Montreal Canadiens goalie Patrick Roy joined the team. Feeling humiliated for being left in the net after having let in nine goals in 26 shots during a Canadiens game against the Red Wings, Roy joined <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> on December 6, 1995, together with ex-Montreal captain Mike Keane in a trade for Jocelyn Thibault, Martin Ručinský and Andrei Kovalenko. Roy would prove a pivotal addition for Colorado in the years to come.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the season, Wojtek Wolski was <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> player seen as {{favorite}} to contend for the Calder Memorial Trophy; however, the scoring streak put Stastny into contention as well. Stastny's play {{was one of the reasons}} <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> experienced their best run of the season towards the end, winning 15 of their last 19games but missing the playoffs by one point. Stastny ended his rookie season with 78points, finished second to Pittsburgh Penguins' Evgeni Malkin in the voting for the Calder Memorial Trophy and was named to the 2006–07 NHL All-Rookie Team.|$|E

5|$|Before the 2017–18 season, <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> {{unveiled}} new uniforms {{as part of}} {{the switch}} to Adidas. The look was inspired from the original uniforms they wore from 1995 to 2007, save for the bold silver border that pays homage to Colorado's silver mining industry.|$|E
5|$|Four days later, Roy {{was dealt}} to the Colorado Avalanche with Mike Keane in {{exchange}} for Jocelyn Thibault, Martin Rucinsky and Andrei Kovalenko. The deal vaulted <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche,</b> the former Nordiques, to the 1996 Stanley Cup. Roy won another title with <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> in 2001 along with a third Conn Smythe Trophy before retiring in 2003 with more wins than any NHL goaltender. The Canadiens, meanwhile, fell into an extended stretch of mediocrity, missing the playoffs in four of their next ten seasons and failing to advance past {{the second round of}} the playoffs until 2010. The team's lack of playoff success brought an end to its streak of winning a Stanley Cup in each decade from the 1910s to the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In 1996–97, Colorado won the Pacific Division, {{as well as}} the Presidents' Trophy for {{finishing}} the regular season with {{the best record in the}} league: 49–24–9 for 107 points. The team was also the league's best scoring with an average of 3.38 goals scored per game. <b>The</b> <b>Avalanche</b> met the two lowest seeds of the Western Conference in the first two rounds of the playoffs: the Chicago Blackhawks and the Edmonton Oilers, and defeated them in six games and five games, respectively. During a rematch of the previous year Western Conference Finals, <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> lost to the Detroit Red Wings in six games. Detroit went on to sweep the Stanley Cup Finals just as <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> had done the year before. Sandis Ozolinsh was elected for the league's first All-Star team at the end of the season.|$|E

5|$|On May 9, 2008, the Colorado Avalanche Organization {{announced}} that Joel Quenneville {{would not return}} to coach the team next season. Two weeks later, Tony Granato was named head coach of <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> for the second time.|$|E
5|$|On November 17, 2008, Stastny {{signed a}} US$33-million, five-year {{contract}} extension with <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche.</b> The contract {{began in the}} 2009–10 season and runs through 2013–14; he will be paid an average of $6.6 million a year.

50|$|Van der Gulik {{spent the}} entire 2009-10 season in his {{hometown}} with new Flames AHL affiliate, the Abbotsford Heat, finishing second in scoring with 40 points.

Following attending <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche's</b> training camp, he was reassigned during the pre-season to <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche's</b> AHL affiliate, <b>the</b> Lake Erie Monsters, to begin the 2010-11 season.|$|R

5|$|Sakic led <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> {{in scoring}} {{again in the}} 2001–02 season, {{finishing}} sixth in the league with 79 points. On March 9, 2002, he played in his 1,000th career game. <b>The</b> <b>Avalanche</b> once again reached the Western Conference Finals, but lost to the eventual Cup-winning Detroit Red Wings. The following year, Sakic appeared in only 58 games and finished with just 58 points. He rebounded the following year, finishing third in the league with 87 points. It also {{marked the first time}} since the 1993–94 season that his team did not win the division title, which was won by the Vancouver Canucks.|$|E
5|$|Sakic's {{leadership}} {{qualities and}} abilities helped carry <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> {{in the years}} after their 2001 Stanley Cup, which saw the team lose key players to retirement and free agency, especially after the 2004–05 lockout.|$|E
5|$|Stastny was draft-eligible in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft, but {{opted out}} of the draft. Prior to the draft, the NHL Central Scouting Bureau ranked him as the 49th best North-American skater available. Ranked by CSB as the 74th best in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft, he was drafted by the Colorado Avalanche in the second round, 44th overall. Before moving to Denver in 1996, <b>the</b> <b>Avalanche</b> were the Quebec Nordiques, the team for which his father played from 1980–1990 and had his jersey number retired.
