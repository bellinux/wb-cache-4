You {{have to turn}} this into music. You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E
25|$|Courtney {{suffered}} a skull fracture on June 12, 1915 while traveling by train {{with his team}} to the 1915 Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championship Regatta. The train lurched and his head struck one of the berths. At first he did not <b>think</b> <b>anything</b> about the incident, but he started hemorrhage from his nose and mouth. He refused to consult a doctor and continued to get his team ready for the regatta. On race day, he was confined to bed and returned to Ithaca, New York where the skull fracture was diagnosed. Courtney would sue New York Central for $75,000 for his injuries.|$|E
25|$|Channing {{continued}} {{her return to}} the stage by teaming up again with playwright John Guare. She received Tony Award nominations for her performances in his plays, The House of Blue Leaves (1986) and Six Degrees of Separation (1990), for which she also won an Obie Award. The Alan Ayckbourn play Woman in Mind received its American premiere Off-Broadway in February 1988 at the Manhattan Theatre Club. The production was directed by Lynne Meadow and the cast included Channing {{in the role of}} Susan, for which she won a Drama Desk Award for Best Actress. When once asked if Susan was Channing's most fully realized character, the actress replied: Well, you like to think that they’re all fully realized because what you’re doing is different from what anyone else is seeing. You do a character but {{how much of it is}} on film, or how much of it is seen by an audience, is really up to the director, the piece, or the audience. And so, I just do these people. And flesh them out. I <b>think</b> <b>anything</b> else is not my job.|$|E

[...] Lincoln replied, [...] "She won't <b>think</b> <b>anything</b> about it". In {{following}} years these words were traditionally considered Lincoln's last, though N.W. Miner, a family friend, claimed in 1882 that Mary Lincoln told him that Lincoln's last words expressed a wish to visit Jerusalem.|$|E
500|$|Manning {{was always}} a close {{observer}} of life, and gifted with a photographic memory. She told her friend Kay Dick that [...] "I write out of experience, I have no fantasy. I don't <b>think</b> <b>anything</b> I've experienced has ever been wasted. However, her 1974 novel The Rain Forest showed off her creative skills in her portrayal of a fictional island in the Indian Ocean and its inhabitants. Set in 1953, the novel's central characters are a British couple; the book examines their personal experiences and tragedies {{against the background of}} a violent end to colonial British rule. The book is one of Manning's lesser-known books, and she was disappointed that it was not shortlisted for the Booker prize.|$|E
500|$|Martin's {{publishers}} initially expected A Game of Thrones to be a best-seller, but {{the first}} installment did not even reach any lower positions in bestseller list. This left Martin unsurprised, as it is [...] "a fool's game to <b>think</b> <b>anything</b> {{is going to be}} successful or to count on it". However, the book slowly won the passionate advocacy of independent booksellers and the book's popularity grew by word of mouth. The series' popularity skyrocketed in subsequent volumes, with the second and third volume making The New York Times Best Seller lists in 1999 and 2000, respectively. The series gained Martin's old writings new attention, and Martin's American publisher Bantam Spectra was to reprint his out-of-print solo novels.|$|E

500|$|At 17:20 McCay signalled Bridges {{that large}} numbers of {{unwounded}} men were leaving the battlefield and heading for the beaches. This was followed by Maclagan asking for urgent artillery fire support, onto Gun Ridge, as his left was under a heavy attack and at 18:16 Owen reported the left flank was [...] "rapidly" [...] being forced to retire. At dusk Maclagan made his way to Bridges headquarters and when asked for his opinion replied [...] "It's touch and go. If the Turks come on in mass formation... I don't <b>think</b> <b>anything</b> can stop them." [...] As it got dark the Turkish artillery ceased firing, and although small arms fire continued on both sides, the effects were limited when firing blind. Darkness also provided the opportunity to start digging more substantial trenches and to resupply the troops with water and ammunition.|$|E
500|$|Nina was {{initially}} {{meant to be}} a [...] "bad girl", but the writers rewrote the part for Goodrem, and the character became a [...] "painfully shy schoolgirl" [...] who gets a job in the Coffee Shop. The Age described Nina as the [...] "quintessential girl next door". Goodrem described her character as [...] "a quiet, unassuming type of girl", who did not <b>think</b> <b>anything</b> of her amazing gift. When Goodrem was asked if she was similar to Nina, she replied [...] "I think I am in some ways and in some ways I'm not. Nina's very shy, I really like the character Nina but I think she'd probably walk out of a room and I'd probably chat all day I think that's probably the difference, she'd sneak out of a room and I'd stay!" [...] The BBC agreed with Goodrem and said that Nina would not say [...] "boo to a goose" [...] and would flee if anyone looked her way.|$|E

2500|$|Opposition to {{the park}} {{movement}} was eased when the Park Commission allowed residents to obtain lifetime leases and remain in their homes.

[...] Many chose to remain on lifetime leases, but restrictions on farming and logging would force most people out of Cataloochee by 1943. [...] Most simply moved elsewhere in Haywood County.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the time}} that Tiberius died, Agrippina had become pregnant. Domitius had {{acknowledged}} the paternity of the child. In {{the early morning hours}} in Antium of December 15, 37, Agrippina gave birth to a son. Agrippina and Domitius named their son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, after the Domitius' recently deceased father. This child would grow up to become the Emperor Nero. Nero was Agrippina's only natural child. Suetonius states that Domitius was congratulated by friends on the birth of his son, whereupon he replied [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>anything</b> produced by me and Agrippina could possibly be good for the state or the people".|$|E

2500|$|Just {{before the}} 1974–75 season, with women's college {{basketball}} {{still in its}} infancy and not yet an NCAA-sanctioned sport, 22-year-old Summitt became a graduate assistant at the University of Tennessee, and was named head coach of the Lady Vols after the previous coach suddenly quit. Summitt earned $250 monthly and washed the players' uniforms – uniforms purchased the previous year with proceeds from a donut sale. Summitt recalled that era of women's basketball during a February 2009 interview with Time. [...] "I had to drive the van when I first started coaching," [...] Summitt said. [...] "One time, for a road game, we actually slept in the other team's gym the night before. We had mats, we had our little sleeping bags.
