There was also a significant elevation in the corrected FMC (cFMC), which takes in to account the cloning efficiency of the T cells, in <b>the</b> peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>of</b> RA patients compared to controls. There is an elevated FMC and cFMC in synovial fluid of RA patients compared to <b>the</b> peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>of</b> controls. However. <b>the</b> FMC and cFMC from <b>the</b> peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>of</b> unselected RA patients from the outpatient clinic is not significantly different than from the synovial fluid of RA patients suggesting that the synovial fluid does not contain the necessary mitogenic and mutagenic factors to induce T cell genetic damage. The FMC and cFMC from RA and osteoarthritis (OA) synovium is approximately ten fold greater than the FMC and cFMC from <b>the</b> peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same patients which suggests that the mitogenic and genotoxic environment of the inflamed synovium is capable of inducing T cell mutations.

Once the common vampire bat locates a host, such as a sleeping mammal, it lands and approaches it on the ground. It then likely uses thermoception to identify a warm spot on the skin to bite. They then create a small incision with their teeth and lap up blood from the wound.|$|E
