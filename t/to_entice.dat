5|$|Apple CEO John Sculley {{demands to}} know why the world {{believes}} he fired Jobs – Jobs was actually forced out by the Apple board, who were resolute on updating the Apple II following the Macintosh's lackluster sales. Jobs lambasted the decision and dared them to cast a final vote on his tenure, despite Sculley's warnings. After Hoffman and Jobs discuss NeXT's unclear direction, she realizes that Jobs has designed the computer <b>to</b> <b>entice</b> Apple to buy the company and reinstate him.|$|E
5|$|ETNC's {{early success}} also {{attracted}} the attention of other communities in North Texas, and in 1904 Denison attempted <b>to</b> <b>entice</b> Mayo to relocate the college there for a considerable amount of financial aid. Whether or not Mayo seriously considered the offer is unknown, but he was able to use it as leverage to persuade Commerce to give the college $30,000 {{over the next three years}} for the promise that it would remain, money that was mostly used to renovate and expand ETNC's physical plant.|$|E

5|$|Ghadar's {{ultimate}} {{goal was to}} overthrow British colonial authority in India {{by means of an}} armed revolution. It viewed the Congress-led mainstream movement for dominion status modest and the latter's constitutional methods as soft. Ghadar's foremost strategy was <b>to</b> <b>entice</b> Indian soldiers to revolt. To that end, in November 1913 Ghadar established the Yugantar Ashram press in San Francisco. The press produced the Hindustan Ghadar newspaper and other nationalist literature.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the shrinking native population, since the late 1990s {{there has been a}} positive net migration into Croatia, reaching a level of more than 7,000 net immigrants in 2006. In recent years, the Croatian government has been pressured each year to add 40% to work permit quotas for foreign workers. In accordance with its immigration policy, Croatia is also trying <b>to</b> <b>entice</b> emigrants to return.|$|E
5|$|The jackalope {{is subject}} to many outlandish and largely tongue-in-cheek claims {{embedded}} in tall tales about its habits. Jackalopes {{are said to be}} so dangerous that hunters are advised to wear stovepipes on their legs to keep from being gored. Stores in Douglas sell jackalope milk, but The New York Times questions its authenticity on grounds that milking a jackalope is known to be fraught with risk. One of the ways to catch a jackalope is <b>to</b> <b>entice</b> it with whiskey, the jackalope's beverage of choice.|$|E

5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators <b>to</b> <b>entice</b> immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Milhouse torment {{a tourist}} named Howell Huser (a parody of {{television}} personality Huell Howser), who is then chased {{out of town}} by bullies Dolph, Jimbo, and Kearney. Huser is later revealed to be a media personality, and he appears on a network's morning television show warning tourists against visiting Springfield and giving it his lowest rating for any American location (six out of ten). The Springfield tourism business collapses and Mayor Quimby holds an emergency meeting at the town hall. After many senseless suggestions, Lisa suggests that Springfield legalize same-sex marriage <b>to</b> <b>entice</b> visitors to their town. All of Springfield happily agrees with Lisa's idea, even Marge. The town makes a commercial that is broadcast throughout America, convincing {{people to come to}} Springfield.|$|E

Rachel feels slighted when Will awards Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) a solo that she wanted, so she auditions for the musical and is given the lead role.

40|$|Adolescence is a {{transition}} {{period during which}} young people face many changes. Their desire to assert and differentiate themselves is reflected even in their food choices. These choices may have impacts until their adult lives. Moreover the media affect them in contradictory ways from images of extreme thinnesses <b>to</b> <b>enticing</b> advertisements of calorie food. A lack of self-esteem may appear, and in case of fertile ground may cause either diet, either addiction, or eating disorder. A comforting family as well as empathetic physicians have a main role in the medical care. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of jazz in Sweden fed into discourses renegotiating modern forms of identity in welfare society. In this new Jazz Age, music became an arena for reformulating norms of age, class, ethnicity, and gender differences. This article presents an intersectional and inter-medial study of songs, films and print sources with such topics. The new jazz idiom was linked <b>to</b> <b>enticing</b> and horrifying forms of otherness. Four basic positions are highlighted in the successive integration of both jazz and identities, from separation to fusion: demonizing exclusion, primitivist polarization, diversifying hybridization and normalizing assimilation...|$|R
5|$|ETNC's {{relative}} success {{during this}} period led to rivalry with other nearby colleges such as T. Henry Bridges' Henry College in Campbell, a 1904 attempt by Denison <b>to</b> <b>entice</b> Mayo to relocate the college there for {{a considerable amount of}} financial aid, and praise from perhaps its most famous alumnus, future Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Sam Rayburn. By the time the 35th Texas Legislature voted to buy the college in 1917, it had educated more than 30,000 students, including more public school teachers than any other college or university in Texas during the same period.|$|E
5|$|In April 1916 a German battlecruiser {{squadron}} with accompanying cruisers and destroyers bombarded {{the coastal}} ports of Yarmouth and Lowestoft. Although the ports had some military importance, the main {{aim of the}} raid was <b>to</b> <b>entice</b> out defending ships which could then be picked off either by the battlecruiser squadron or by the full High Seas Fleet, which was stationed at sea ready to intervene if an opportunity presented itself. The result was inconclusive: nearby Royal Navy units were too small to intervene so largely kept clear of the German battlecruisers, and the German ships withdrew before the first British fast response battlecruiser squadron or the Grand Fleet could arrive.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Hamburg scene {{revolved}} around the Kaiserkeller, Top Ten, Star-Club, Beer-Shop, Mambo, Holle, Wagabond (pronounced vagabond in German) and the Pacific Hotel, {{as well as the}} less popular clubs like Grannies, the Ice Cream Shop, Chugs, and Sacha's. The Reeperbahn and the Grosse Freiheit were decorated with neon lights, with posters advertising the performers in the clubs. Each club had a doorman whose job was <b>to</b> <b>entice</b> customers inside, as the drinks were expensive (for Babycham and watered-down beer). Customers who would not, or could not afford to pay were dealt with severely by being beaten and then thrown out.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method of}} {{replying}} to Lonely Hearts adverts is via telephone; this {{took off with}} the introduction of premium-rate telephone numbers, providing an additional way for the publisher to generate money. The usual business model is for the advertiser <b>to</b> be <b>enticed</b> <b>to</b> place an advert free of charge (using an 0800 number or equivalent); those replying (and also the advertiser, when they want to check for any replies) must use a premium-rate line.|$|R

50|$|Yellow Kid success boosted {{sales of}} the New York World, fueling the greed of Hearst. Fierce {{competition}} between Hearst and Pulitzer in 1896 led <b>to</b> <b>enticing</b> away of Outcault by Hearst {{to work in the}} New York Journal. A bitter legal battle allowed Pulitzer to keep publishing Hogan's Alley (which he entrusted to Georges B. Luks) and Hearst to publish the series under another name. Richard Outcault chose the title The Yellow Kid. Published in 1897, the Yellow Kid magazine consisting of sheets previously appeared in newspapers {{and it was the first}} magazine of its kind.|$|R
5|$|Males sing {{constantly}} as {{the breeding}} period approaches and perform less often once pairs have bonded. In {{the presence of}} a female, a male sometimes flies to his nest and sings from the entrance, apparently attempting <b>to</b> <b>entice</b> the female in. Older birds tend to have a wider repertoire than younger ones. Those males that engage in longer bouts of singing and that have wider repertoires attract mates earlier and have greater reproductive success than others. Females appear to prefer mates with more complex songs, perhaps because this indicates greater experience or longevity. Having a complex song is also useful in defending a territory and deterring less experienced males from encroaching.|$|E
5|$|Orange Bowl {{organizers}} {{predicted that}} Virginia Tech fans, who were located {{closer to the}} site of the game, would be attracted by its proximity and the warm weather offered by southern Florida. Delta Air Lines added more flights from Virginia to Florida in anticipation. <b>To</b> <b>entice</b> more fans to attend, tourism officials planned to step up their advertising in order to boost the economic impact of the event, estimated in 2009 at $200million. The advertising campaign was a difficult sell because the game was scheduled for the first Monday after New Year's Day, the date when most American workers return to their jobs after the New Year.|$|E
5|$|Pipeline {{construction}} {{ended in}} 1977, beginning a gradual decline in Fairbanks' economy. The loss of construction spending was mostly offset by state spending. Taxes on oil {{flowing through the}} pipeline were spent on low-interest loans, grants, and business assistance that poured money into the city. <b>To</b> <b>entice</b> businesses to return to downtown Fairbanks, the city demolished many of the bars favored by pipeline workers and attempted to attract a hotel or major business to the location. This effort was unsuccessful, and the land remained vacant until the late 1990s. Redevelopment of the Fairbanks airport was more successful. A new terminal built in 1984 functioned until 2009.|$|E

5|$|The Croatian Bureau of Statistics {{forecast}} {{that the}} population may shrink to 3.1million by 2051, depending on actual birth rate {{and the level of}} net migration. The population of Croatia rose steadily from 2.1million in 1857 until 1991, when it peaked at 4.7million, with exception of censuses taken in 1921 and 1948, i.e. following two world wars. The natural growth rate of the population is currently negative with the demographic transition completed in the 1970s.

5|$|Tripathi had {{initially}} {{decided to write}} a book on the philosophy of evil, but was dissuaded by his family members, so he decided {{to write a book}} on Shiva, one of the Hindu Gods. He decided to base his story on a radical idea that all Gods were once human beings; it was their deeds in the human life that made them famous as Gods. After finishing writing The Immortals of Meluha, Tripathi faced rejection from many publication houses. Ultimately when his agent decided to publish the book himself, Tripathi embarked on a promotional campaign. It included posting a live-action video on YouTube, and making the first chapter of the book available as a free digital download, <b>to</b> <b>entice</b> readers.|$|E

Fellers goes to Konoe's home and asks him if the Emperor was responsible for starting the war. Konoe gives no conclusive evidence, but directs Fellers to Kōichi Kido, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. While Fellers waits to meet with Kido, he recalls the time before the war when Aya suddenly returned to Japan. Takahashi informs Fellers Kido will not show up.|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s the British and Irish governments {{moved away from}} the policy of {{attempting}} to marginalise the IRA and Sinn Féin <b>to</b> <b>enticing</b> republicanism into mainstream politics.
