5|$|Modern plant breeders {{develop new}} crop {{varieties}} to meet specific conditions. A new variety might, for example, be higher yielding, more disease resistant {{or have a}} longer shelf life than the varieties from which it was bred. The practical use of crop diversity goes back to early agricultural methods of crop rotation and fallow fields, where planting and harvesting one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> on a plot of land one year, and planting a different crop on that same plot the next year. This takes advantage of differences in a plant's nutrient needs, but more importantly reduces the buildup of pathogens.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{conducted}} on peri urban wastewater irrigation agriculture in Zambia have not adequately tackled issues pertaining to farmer managed irrigation systems in heavy metal contaminated wastewater irrigation farming. The {{study focused on}} characteristics of farmer managed irrigation systems in wastewater irrigation farming contaminated with heavy metals at New Farm in Mufulira and Chilumba Gardens in Kafue. The study objectives were to ascertain the nature of irrigation practices and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> grown at the two study sites in Zambia. It was hypothesised that: (i) the nature of irrigation practices and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> {{were not significantly different}} at the two study sites in different seasons. (ii) the agro-ecological factors did not significantly influence the nature of irrigation practices and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops.</b> The method comprised observation of sources of water supply, methods <b>of</b> irrigation and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> grown coupled with agro-ecological factors such as soil, slope and drainage at field plots located at regular intervals along transects established in the stratified sampling zones. The results indicated that farmer managed irrigation systems at the two study sites were characterised by multiple sources of water supply, multiple methods of irrigation, relatively high number <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> per study site equivalent to twenty <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> grown per study site and relatively high number <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> per field plot ranging from one crop to ten crops per field plot coupled with multiple cycles of agricultural practices. The nature of irrigation practices and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> were influenced by a combination of agro-ecological factors. In conclusion, the farmer managed irrigation systems in wastewater irrigation farming were characterised by traditional irrigation practices, high crop diversification and multiple cycles of agricultural practices which were typical of traditional farmer managed irrigation systems. It can be argued that the crop cultivators have adapted the rural traditional irrigation systems’ practices to the peri urban wastewater irrigation systems in Zambia which confirmed the findings from other studies in developing countries. The study findings will be used to select and implement appropriate agricultural practices which can mitigate the negative effects of heavy metal contamination...|$|R
50|$|Recessional {{agriculture}} {{is a form}} of agricultural cultivation that takes place on a floodplain. Farmers practice recessional agriculture by successively planting in the flooded areas after the waters recede. Thus recessional agriculture serves as a rudimentary form of irrigation. Soil type is an important consideration in recessional agriculture. One <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> grown by this method is sorghum. Clay soils are especially suitable for recessional agriculture.|$|E
50|$|Erosion is also {{an issue}} in areas of modern farming, where the removal of native {{vegetation}} for the cultivation and harvesting of a single <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> has left the soil unsupported. Many of these regions are near rivers and drainages. Loss of soil due to erosion removes useful farmland, adds to sediment loads, and can help transport anthropogenic fertilizers into the river system, which leads to eutrophication.|$|E
50|$|The {{profitability}} of a UBPC {{is influenced by}} the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> it grows, with those growing milk or sugar, for example, being less profitable than those growing livestock or citrus. Profitability is measured by the return on the investment measured in Cuban pesos. An UBPC that receives one peso of profit per 50 centavos invested is more profitable than one that receives one peso profit per 80 centavos invested.|$|E

50|$|A cereal is any grass {{cultivated}} for the edible {{components of}} its grain (botanically, {{a type of}} fruit called a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> and are therefore staple crops. Edible grains from other plant families, such as buckwheat (Polygonaceae), quinoa (Amaranthaceae) and chia (Lamiaceae), {{are referred to as}} pseudocereals.|$|E
50|$|Most {{food has}} its origin in plants. Some food is {{obtained}} directly from plants; but even {{animals that are}} used as food sources are raised by feeding them food derived from plants. Cereal grain is a staple food that provides more food energy worldwide than any other <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop.</b> Corn (maize), wheat, and rice - in all of their varieties - account for 87% of all grain production worldwide. Most of the grain that is produced worldwide is fed to livestock.|$|E

5000|$|Climate change. The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> {{that can}} be grown is {{affected}} by changes in temperatures {{and the length of}} the growing season. Climate change could also modify the availability of water for production. Farmers in several countries, including Canada, India, Kenya, Mozambique, and Sri Lanka have already initiated diversification as a response to climate change. Government policy in Kenya to promote crop diversification has included the removal of subsidies for some crops, encouraging land-use zoning and introducing differential land tax systems.|$|E
50|$|Fenthion {{exposure}} to general population is quite limited {{based on its}} bioavailability. Common form of fenthion exposure is occupation related, and occurs through dermal contact or inhalation of dust and sprays. Another likely means of contamination is through ingestion of food, especially, if it has been applied quite recently with fenthion. So far, ingestion {{is the most likely}} severe poisoning case on humans and animals. To avoid this, crops applied with fenthion should be allowed enough degradation time before harvesting. Normally, two to four weeks time is enough depending upon the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop.</b>|$|E
50|$|Before the {{industrialization}} of agriculture, a {{much wider}} variety of plant foods were grown for human consumption. During the 19th and early 20th centuries the diversity was huge. Old nursery catalogues were filled with plums, peaches, pears and apples of numerous varieties. In modern agriculture in the industrialized world, most food crops are now grown in large, monocultural plots. In order to maximize consistency, few varieties of each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> are grown. These varieties are often selected for their productivity, their ability to withstand mechanical picking and cross-country shipping, and their tolerance to drought, frost, or pesticides.|$|E

50|$|The great {{majority}} of horticultural applications of plant support netting are vertical, {{even though there are}} also great horizontal uses. When it is used vertically to provide support to the vegetable trellis, the netting is fastened to a line of posts or supports (metal, bamboo or wood) distanced from 1.5 to up to 8 meters (depending to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop,</b> soil type, climate etc.) where the furrow ends have posts that are larger and stronger and preferably have a tension string or twine on top that is anchored {{on both sides of the}} furrow and tensioned in between posts.|$|E
50|$|The {{second phase}} {{involves}} improving/enriching the soil by planting nitrogen-fixating plants {{and using the}} soil immediately to grow crops. Nitrogen fixating plants used include clover, yellow mustard, beans, etc., and food crops include wheat, barley, beans, peas, sweet potatoes, date, olives, limes, figs, apricot, guava, tomato, certain herbs, etc. Regardless of the cover crop used, the crops (not including any trees) are each year harvested and/or plowed into the soil (e.g. with clover). In addition, each year the plots are used for another <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> (known as crop rotation) to prevent depleting the soil on specific trace elements.|$|E
