5|$|Just before Jaffa was conquered by Israeli {{troops in}} April 1948, the family fled {{to their house}} near Majdal, but the Jewish militias arrived there too, {{and they had to}} flee again. This time <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, then under Egyptian control. Melman writes that the family spent nine months living in tents, {{dependent}} on UNRWA for an allowance of oil, rice and potatoes. The experience had a powerful effect on Abu Nidal.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Georgetown's Floyd and North Carolina's Worthy also drew some {{attention from the}} media. The two players grew up in Gastonia, North Carolina together, where <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same church and competed in high school against each other. Worthy commented that his family lives around two to three miles away from Floyd's. It was noted that the two would likely not interact much while playing as they did not play the same position.|$|E
5|$|Tinker was the {{starting}} shortstop for the Chicago Cubs from 1902 to 1912. He was a speedy runner, stealing {{an average of}} 28 bases a season and even stealing home twice in one game on July 28, 1910. He also excelled at fielding, often leading the National League {{in a number of}} statistical categories (including four times in fielding percentage). During his decade with the Cubs, <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> World Series four times, winning in 1907 and 1908.|$|E

5|$|At {{about the}} same time, another group of Hatanaka's rebels led by Captain Takeo Sasaki went to Prime Minister Suzuki's office, intent on killing him. When they found it empty, they machine-gunned the office and set the {{building}} on fire, then left for his home. Hisatsune Sakomizu had warned Suzuki, and he escaped minutes before the would-be assassins arrived. After setting fire to Suzuki's home, <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> estate of Kiichirō Hiranuma to assassinate him. Hiranuma escaped through a side gate and the rebels burned his house as well. Suzuki {{spent the rest of}} August under police protection, spending each night in a different bed.|$|E
5|$|Claude Ewing Rusk, a local settler and mountaineer, was one {{of those}} most {{familiar}} with Adams and he was instrumental in many of the names given to places around the mountain. In 1890, he, his mother Josie, and his sister Leah completed a circuit of the mountain and explored, to some extent, all ten of its principle glaciers. This was the first recorded circuit of Adams by a woman and likely the first recorded circuit by anyone. While they were on the east side, they named Avalanche Valley. Later, in 1897, after they had completed an ascent of Adams, <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ridge of Wonders and his mother, awestruck by the scene, named it as such.|$|E

5|$|Continuing to drift, Cofresí and {{his crew}} were {{captured}} after his ship reached Santo Domingo. Sentenced to six years in prison, they were sent to a keep named Torre del Homenaje. Cofresí and his men escaped, were recaptured and again imprisoned. The group escaped again, breaking the locks on their cell doors and climbing down the prison walls on a stormy night on a rope made from their clothing. With Cofresí were two other inmates: a man known as Portalatín and Manuel Reyes Paz, former boatswain of El Scipión. After reaching the province of San Pedro de Macorís, the pirates bought a ship. They sailed from Hispaniola in late September to Naguabo, where Portalatín disembarked. From there <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island of Vieques, where they set up another hideout and regrouped.|$|E

His mother {{said he had been}} watching the rioting on television and asked if he could join in. Father and son decided instead to go to a car auction. Jamal had just sold his 1974 Fiat, Motro wrote, and Muhammad loved cars, so <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> auction together.|$|E
5|$|On 4 April 1718 England, France and the Dutch Republic (and later Austria) {{selected}} Don Carlos of Spain, {{the elder}} child of Elisabeth Farnese and Philip V of Spain, as the Tuscan heir (with {{no mention of}} Anna Maria Luisa). By 1722, the Electress was not even acknowledged as heiress, and Cosimo {{was reduced to a}} spectator at the conferences for Tuscany's future. In the midst of this, Marguerite Louise, Anna Maria Luisa's mother, died. Instead of willing her valuables to her children, as prescribed by the 1674 agreement, <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Princess of Epinoy, a distant relative.|$|E

5|$|Perceived as effeminate, Jones was bullied {{in school}} and, {{at the age}} of 14, was forced out of his family home by his father. He moved into a {{derelict}} house in Montego Bay with transgender friends. On the evening of 21 July 2013, <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Irwin area of the city and attended a dance party. When some men at the party discovered that the cross-dressing Jones was not a woman, they confronted and attacked him. Jones was beaten, stabbed, shot, and run over with a car; he died {{in the early hours of}} the morning. Police investigated the murder but did not arrest or charge anyone for the crime, which remains unsolved.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{continued}} around Topusko, {{which was}} besieged by the Serb rebels on 28 July. The same day, heavy fighting also erupted near Hrvatska Kostajnica and Hrvatska Dubica. In Dvor, Sundać and several soldiers from his platoon {{arrived at the}} regional SAO Krajina military headquarters threatening the commanding officer, holding him responsible for losses the platoon had suffered in the fighting. The group also demanded that the authorities turn any prisoners over to them, but the demand was refused. Finally, <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> medical centre in Dvor, where they forced eight wounded Croat civilians and two policemen, {{out of the building}} and beat them in front of 100 onlookers. There are conflicting reports that all ten were killed, or that only an unspecified number of female patients were killed. On 29 July, the remaining Croatian civilian population in Struga, Unčani, Divuša and Golubovac Divuški accepted an offer made by the JNA to evacuate them to Hrvatska Kostajnica. When the column of evacuating civilians reached Kozibrod, the population of that village also joined them, followed by the police and ZNG troops stationed in Kozibrod. The move left the SAO Krajina and the JNA in control of the bulk of Banovina.|$|E
5|$|Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine died in June 1717. Anna Maria Luisa {{returned}} home in October 1717, bringing with her vast treasures. Cosimo created his elder son's widow, Violante of Bavaria, Governess of Siena as to clearly define her precedence. That {{did not stop}} the two ladies from quarrelling, as was his intention. Cosimo discontinued hunting following an accident in January 1717. He accidentally shot, and killed, a man. He was so distraught, that he wished to be tried by the Knights of the Order of Saint Stephen. The state of the Grand Duchy reflected the decay of its ruler; in a 1718 military review, the army numbered less than 3000 men, {{some of whom were}} infirm, and aged 70. The navy composed of three galleys, and the crew 198. In September 1721, the Grand Duchess died; instead of willing her possessions to her children, as prescribed by the 1674 agreement; <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Princess of Epinoy.|$|E

5|$|Following the coup, a Military Revolutionary Council (MRC) was formed, {{comprising}} 12 generals including Đính, each of {{whom had}} equal voting power. They appointed a cabinet mainly consisting of civilians led by Prime Minister Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ, {{who had been the}} titular Vice President under Diệm. Đính was initially made interior minister, but Thơ was said to have personally opposed the appointment. Eventually Minh, the head of the military junta, struck a compromise whereby Đính was made Security Minister and Administrative Affairs, which partially covered the interior ministry. He was the 2nd Deputy Chairman of the MRC behind Minh and Đôn. However, tension persisted as Thơ's civilian government was plagued by infighting. According to Thơ's assistant, Nguyễn Ngọc Huy, the presence of Đôn and Đính in both the civilian cabinet and the MRC paralyzed the governance process. Đính and Đôn were subordinate to Thơ in the civilian government, but as members of the MRC they were superior to him. When Thơ gave a cabinet order with which the generals disagreed, <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MRC and gave a counter-order. Đính and the new national police chief, General Xuân, were accused of arresting people en masse, before releasing them in return for bribes and pledges of loyalty. The junta performed indecisively and was heavily criticised, especially Minh, who was viewed as being too apathetic towards his country's situation. During the MRC's tenure, South Vietnam suffered more and more losses to the Vietcong.|$|E
