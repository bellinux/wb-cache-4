40|$|Unpredictable fatigue {{failures}} of cantilevered <b>traffic</b> signal <b>structures</b> in Texas {{and throughout the}} United States {{in recent years have}} created the need to study their fatigue behavior. Based on recent research, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) specification has adopted a design equation for galloping loads that is overly conservative in many cases. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is interested in establishing design criteria for galloping that more accurately represents galloping potential and provides a more efficient design. In this study, three signal structures in Texas were monitored for a total of 9 months to detect the magnitude of galloping forces experienced in the field. Although large-amplitude displacements were measured in the field, sustained galloping did not occur. In addition to the field tests, an analytical model was developed and used to perform a parametric study for predicting the galloping potential of <b>traffic</b> signal <b>structures</b> with various properties.

40|$|<b>Traffic</b> signal <b>structures</b> undergo wind-induced {{vibrations}} {{that result}} in fatigue damage accumulation and reduced service life. Mast arms have failed and required removal while in service. A dual experimental and analytical modeling approach is taken to mitigate fatigue and fracture in steel <b>traffic</b> supporting <b>structures.</b> A full-scale prototype structure is instrumented to study natural wind response. Excitation mechanisms are identified, and response is characterized statistically by a lognormal distribution. Helical strakes are found to reduce the vortex-induced vibration of cantilevered <b>traffic</b> signal <b>structures,</b> however are not a panacea for fatigue mitigation as marginal service life gains occur in severe wind environments. A probabilistic framework is extended to assess the risk of wind-induced fatigue and estimate service life while considering uncertainties in fatigue demand and capacity. The framework is successfully demonstrated against compiled inspection records. Locations with higher prevailing winds are susceptible to wind-induced fatigue, but the prevalence of low-speed vortex-induced response is primarily responsible for the early fatigue failures in more mild environments. A low-cost damage avoidance system is proposed to mitigate fatigue and fracture in steel <b>traffic</b> supporting <b>structures.</b> Applied prestress introduces a fail-safe, supplementary load path to balance dead load moment, eradicating the detrimental tensile mean stress found in <b>traffic</b> signal <b>structure</b> connections. Field observations are made without and with the proposed system installed. The benefit of applied prestress is quantified by determining service life without and with the system based on changes in response and fatigue resistance using: (i) a code-based technique; and (ii) the proposed probabilistic framework. Fatigue performance is modeled as mean stress-dependent by modifying nominal stress-life relationships. Service life is shown to increase by an order of magnitude, regardless of wind environment. The concept shows potential to reduce the detrimental effects of non-redundancy {{for a variety of}} similar, fatigue-critical infrastructure components. The validity of simplified mean stress-dependent connection modeling is explored. A fracture mechanics-based, total life (initiation-propagation) model is used to demonstrate the detrimental effect mean stress has on tube-to-transverse base plate fatigue resistance. Using fatigue strength curves derived from total life analyses, probabilistic analyses are repeated to justify the use of simplified models...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAir Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) aims at <b>structuring</b> <b>traffic</b> {{in order}} to reduce {{congestion}} in airspace. Congestion being linked to aircraft located at the same position at the same time, ATFM organizes traffic in the spatial dimension (e. g. route network) and in the time dimension (e. g. sequencing and merging of aircraft flows taking off or landing at airports). The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a methodology that allows the traffic to self-organize in the time and space dimensions when demand is high. This structure disappears when the demand diminishes. In order to reach this goal, a multi-agent system has been developed, in which aircraft cooperate to <b>structure</b> <b>traffic.</b> Multi-agent systems have several advantages, including a good resilience when confronted with disruptive events. In this system, three algorithms have been implemented, aiming at reducing traffic complexity in three different ways. The first algorithm allows aircraft agents flying on a route network to regulate speed {{in order to}} reduce the number of conflicts, a conflict occurring when two aircraft do not respect separation norms. The second algorithm allows aircraft to solve conflicts when the <b>traffic</b> is not <b>structured</b> by a route network. The third algorithm creates temporary local route networks allowing to <b>structure</b> <b>traffic.</b> The three algorithms implemented in this multi-agent system allow to decrease overall traffic complexity, which becomes easier to manage by air traffic controllers.
