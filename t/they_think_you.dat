The powers that be are only as interested in you as <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are in the job. For me it's about more than turning up and saying the lines. It's about understanding it and trying to make it better. That's actually a lot of fun. What's great is nobody says, 'Just shut up.' They want you to work at it. [...] I surprise myself sometimes because after {{two and a half years}} sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think, 'do I want to do something else?' but I really like this job, I never get that awful ‘dread’ feeling when you really don’t want to go into work." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael {{describes}} the roast as {{an event in}} the style of televised comedy specials that air on the cable network, Comedy Central. In describing the upcoming roast, Michael says he plans to call YouTube, an online video sharing website, to record the event. During the roast, Pam says Michael's penis is so small, [...] "If it were an iPod, it would be a Shuffle", a reference to the smallest of the Apple Inc. portable media player brands. Kelly said she would rather kiss Lord Voldemort, the hideous antagonist of the Harry Potter novels and films, than Michael. Andy sings a song about Michael, [...] "What I Hate About You", to the tune of the rock song by The Romantics, [...] "What I Like About You". Angela makes a joke, [...] "If you put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott", which is modeled after the [...] "you might be a redneck" [...] one-liner jokes by comedian Jeff Foxworthy. While roasting his co-workers {{at the end of the}} episode, Michael says to Andy, [...] "Cornell called and <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> suck", a reference to Cornell University, the Ithaca, New York college the Andy character attended.|$|E
2500|$|According to Gellman, {{prior to}} their first meeting in person, Snowden wrote, [...] "I {{understand}} that I {{will be made to}} suffer for my actions, and that the return of this information to the public marks my end." [...] Snowden also told Gellman that until the articles were published, the journalists working with him would also be at mortal risk from the United States Intelligence Community [...] "if <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are the single point of failure that could stop this disclosure and make them the sole owner of this information." ...|$|E

2500|$|... “The Council of State of {{the first}} Arab {{government}} in Mesopotamia since the (thirteenth century) Abbasid’s” as Bell described it, met on Tuesday, 2 November 1920. Along with Sassoon as Minister of Finance, Jafar Pasha al-Askari as Minister of Defence and six other ministers including Sayid Talib as Minister of the Interior. The {{next step was to}} choose a King to unite the tribally fractured country. Sassoon had already offered his opinions on the matter as was recounted again by Miss Bell: “I had a long and interesting talk with Sasun Eff. the other day—I went to call on his sister in law and found all the men there eager to embark on talk. Sasun Eff. said he felt sure that no local man would be acceptable as head of the state because every other local man would be jealous of him. He went on to throw out feelers in different directions—one might think of a son of the Sharif, or {{a member of the family}} of the Sultan of Egypt, if there was a suitable individual, or of the family of the Sultan of Turkey? I said I for my part felt sure that Sir Percy didn't and couldn't mind whom they selected except that I thought the Turkish family was ruled out—it ought to be an Arab prince. Sasun Eff. said [...] "If <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are backing S. Talib they will all agree outwardly to S. Talib, whatever they think of him. I remember when once I happened to be on the same boat with him coming back from Constantinople —it was when S. Talib was a deputy. Almost without exception the people of Basrah hated and feared him, and if you'll believe me they all came down to Muhammarah to welcome him! and the ones that hated him most gave him the most cordial reception. They were afraid of him. So it would be now." [...] I again insisted that we could find no interest or advantage in backing anyone; it was entirely a matter for the people themselves to decide, but whether he believed me or not I can't say. He had, however, hit on the root of the matter. Anyone they think we're backing they will agree to—and then intrigue against him without intermission. It's not an easy furrow to plough!” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Miss Aylmer, I {{have brought}} you two old friends; so old, that <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have {{forgotten}} them--my cousin Lilias, {{and my sister}} Florence.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's it, Ralph," [...] {{said the}} constable, seriously. [...] "It has been {{discovered}} {{that there were two}} men and a boy, and <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> were the boy." ...|$|E
6000|$|WAITER (heartbroken). Oh, no, no, Walter. A waiter {{for your}} father {{on the top of}} a false nose! What will <b>they</b> <b>think</b> of <b>you?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|HOME. Good riddance! [Venomously--his eyes darting between MORE and KATHERINE] Go and stump the country! Find {{out what}} <b>they</b> <b>think</b> of <b>you!</b> You'll pardon me! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why didn't {{you let me}} {{know how}} sick you were? And how came <b>they</b> to <b>think</b> <b>you</b> dead?" [...] I asked, as he festooned the wet linen out of the way, and {{prepared}} to enjoy himself as best he could.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't believe I {{can give}} you that comfort. The fact is, your acting is not much admired among the girls here, but <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are {{unexpectedly}} nice as a private person." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They think you're--you're drowned,' {{replied the}} boy, {{who in his}} {{malicious}} nature had a strong infusion of his master. 'You was last seen {{on the brink of}} the wharf, and <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> tumbled over. Ha ha!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Keola,” she said, “if {{you do not}} eat, I {{tell you}} plainly you will be killed and cooked to-morrow. Some of the old chiefs are murmuring already. <b>They</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are fallen sick and must lose flesh.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{know you}} well enough. I've {{heard you were}} the most pigheaded teacher they ever had at Putnam Hall," [...] rejoined Dick warmly. [...] "I shall take pains to let Mrs. Stanhope know what <b>they</b> <b>think</b> of <b>you,</b> too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The boy's right,' remarked Fagin, looking covertly round, and {{knitting}} his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot. 'You're right, Oliver, you're right; <b>they</b> WILL <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{have stolen}} 'em. Ha! ha!' chuckled the Jew, rubbing his hands, 'it couldn't have happened better, {{if we had}} chosen our time!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take a spare gun at once. If {{there are}} others there, <b>they</b> will <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> are loading, and may show {{themselves}} again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 104. Hubert of Lucca--How came <b>they,</b> <b>think</b> <b>you,</b> {{to choose}} {{him out of}} a {{stranger}} city, and that a poorer one than their own? Was there no Florentine then, of all this rich and eager crowd, who was fit to govern Florence? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And if <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> try {{to stand}} on your legs and walk with the feet of manhood, why, there isn't a {{blooming}} father and lover among them but will do his best to get you down and suffocate you--either with a baby's napkin or a woman's petticoat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say, if you could, you know, {{just try}} to {{interest}} these people to-night with some of your adventures--something told SERIOUSLY, you know, as if you really were in earnest--I'd be awfully obliged to you. The fact is,--you'll excuse me,--but <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> don't come up to your reputation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{know you}} are wrong to make such an absurd statement, and <b>they</b> will {{probably}} <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are a lobster instead of a crab," [...] retorted the animal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou canst {{catch them}} up after. <b>They</b> will only <b>think</b> <b>thee</b> a slug-a- bed. Madge, dear Madge, prithee, I cannot rest without. Weeping will be worse for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sharks {{may indeed}} be {{dangerous}} to you," [...] replied Clia, [...] "so I advise you to keep them at a safe distance. They never dare attempt to bite a mermaid, {{and it may be}} <b>they</b> will <b>think</b> <b>you</b> belong to our band; but it is well to avoid them if possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Westgate poised {{her answer}} {{with a smile}} before {{delivering}} it. [...] "Because <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are not good enough. You are a charming girl, beautiful and amiable, intelligent and clever, and as bien-elevee as {{it is possible to}} be; but you are not a fit match for Lord Lambeth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"Oh, Amal {{is a young}} fool; but, {{speaking}} as sensible men, your Emperor is doing such great things in Gaul that the Winged Hats are anxious to be his friends, or, better still, the friends of his servants. <b>They</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> and Pertinax could lead them to victories." [...] Allo {{looked at me like}} a one-eyed raven.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My {{grandmother}} and Jane won't be pacified till they see you. <b>They</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are not {{fit to be}} in a house by yourself. They both fell on me for having let you go. You must come back, or my grandmother will think you gone off in despair, as you ought to be, and I shall never dare to speak to her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>They</b> <b>think</b> while <b>you</b> (the Independents) {{seem to be}} for a stricter [...] {{discipline}} than others, {{that your}} way or usual practice tendeth to [...] extirpate godliness out of the land, by taking a very few that can [...] talk more than the rest, and making them the Church, &c.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Merely let the {{children}} {{do as they}} like for one day and have full power over you. Let them plan your duties and pleasures, order your food, fix your hours, and punish or reward <b>you</b> as <b>they</b> <b>think</b> proper. <b>You</b> must promise entire obedience, and keep the agreement till night.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] {{she said}} seriously, [...] "I think it's {{perfectly}} horrid to drag you about in such company! It's {{all very well}} for us, because we belong {{and we are in}} a strange city; but I saw some of your friends look at you and whisper. <b>They</b> must <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are mad!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{certainly}} will, or I won't {{tell you}} one single thing. You must understand this: I'm {{not asking you to}} change yourself. Just want you to know what <b>they</b> <b>think.</b> <b>You</b> must do that, no matter how absurd their prejudices are, if you're going to handle them. Is it your ambition to make this a better town, or isn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou knowest, Antonio, {{the state}} must be served, and were its {{officers}} {{to go into the}} palaces in quest of hardy mariners for the fleet, would <b>they,</b> <b>think</b> <b>you,</b> find them that would honor the winged lion in the hour of his need? Thy old arm is muscular, and thy leg steady on the water, and they seek those who, like thee, have been trained to the seas." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are safe}} for the present, my lord. It all depends whether or not <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are a spy. If they come to that conclusion, they will send at once to Abu Klea; and if a strong body is {{stationed}} there, they may have sent a party on to Gakdul, or even to El Howeyat, for they will feel sure that we shall make {{for one of the}} wells." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You do {{look just}} awful," [...] said Felicity. [...] "I don't care--I'm {{going to sit}} in Uncle James' pew. I WON'T sit with you. There will be so many strangers there, and all the Markdale people, and what will <b>they</b> <b>think</b> of <b>you?</b> Some of them will never know the reason, either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} that I shall do nothing of the sort, Otter," [...] {{answered}} Leonard sadly, [...] "but I wish you luck, my friend. If {{you get out of}} this mess, <b>they</b> will <b>think</b> <b>you</b> a god indeed, and should you only find the sense to avoid drink, you may rule here till you die of old age." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wapoota!" [...] {{he said in}} {{an excited}} whisper, [...] "run {{to the rear of the}} foe. Go swiftly, like the sea bird. When you get there, yell, shriek--like-- like--you know how! As you did last time! Change your ground at each yell--so <b>they</b> will <b>think</b> <b>you</b> a host. Fear not to be captured. Your death is nothing. Away!" ...|$|R
