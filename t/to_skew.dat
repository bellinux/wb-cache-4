25|$|Meanwhile, within UNIT's Black Archive, Clara {{learns that}} the Zygons from Elizabethan England {{have entered the}} {{three-dimensional}} paintings in the Undergallery and have emerged in 2013, taking the forms of UNIT members {{so that they could}} utilise UNIT's weapons and technology. While the three Doctors are in their cell, The Moment encourages the War Doctor to ask them the questions he needs answered before he decides whether to destroy Gallifrey. After a tense exchange, the Doctors devise an escape plan. They then encounter the real Queen Elizabeth and learn through her of the Zygon scheme to conquer Earth. Kate Stewart also learns of the Zygon plan and locks herself in the Black Archive with the Zygons, starting a countdown that will detonate a nuclear warhead underneath the archive. The Doctors, unable to land a TARDIS in the Black Archive, instead use the stasis cube technology to enter a painting. They exit the painting in the present and use the archive's mind-wiping equipment to render the UNIT members and Zygons temporarily unaware which of them are which. The countdown is stopped and all present negotiate a perfectly fair peace treaty, as they no longer know which way <b>to</b> <b>skew</b> it.|$|E
25|$|Assuming {{that low}} turnout is a {{reflection}} of disenchantment or indifference, a poll with very low turnout may not be an accurate reflection of the will of the people. On the other hand, if low turnout {{is a reflection}} of contentment of voters about likely winners or parties, then low turnout is as legitimate as high turnout, as long as the right to vote exists. Still, low turnouts can lead to unequal representation among various parts of the population. In developed countries, non-voters tend to be concentrated in particular demographic and socioeconomic groups, especially the young and the poor. However, in India, which boasts an electorate of more than 814 million people, the opposite is true. The poor, who comprise the majority of the demographic, are more likely to vote than the rich and the middle classes, and turnout is higher in rural areas than urban areas. In low-turnout countries, these groups are often significantly under-represented in elections. This has the potential <b>to</b> <b>skew</b> policy. For instance, a high voter turnout among the elderly coupled with a low turnout among the young may lead to more money for retirees' health care, and less for youth employment schemes. Some nations thus have rules that render an election invalid if too few people vote, such as Serbia, where three successive presidential elections were rendered invalid in 2003.|$|E
500|$|Japanese {{military}} {{records are}} a valuable source for estimating {{the number of}} Chinese POWs massacred by Japanese soldiers, {{but the number of}} civilians massacred is more difficult to determine. The final type of source mentioned by David Askew is data sampling, and though only one such survey of this variety was conducted, Lewis S.C. Smythe's [...] "War Damage in the Nanking Area", it is an essential document for estimating civilian casualties of the atrocity. According to Smythe's survey, as many as 12,000 civilians were killed within the city of Nanking plus another 26,870 in the rural counties outside Nanking. However, some historians have variously argued that Smythe's figures are either underestimates or exaggerations of the true civilian death toll. On the one hand, Kasahara asserts that the survey substantially underestimated the death toll, partly because Smythe only surveyed inhabited homes and thus skipped over the homes of families who had been entirely destroyed or been unable to return. By contrast, Minoru Kitamura argues that Smythe's links to the Nationalist Government of China may have led him <b>to</b> <b>skew</b> his figures upwards.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that borrowing within a group of genetically related languages often causes the lexical similar-ities among them <b>to</b> be <b>skewed.</b> Consequently, it has been proposed that borrowing can sometimes be inferred from such skewing. However, heterogeneity {{in the rate of}} lexical replacement, as well as borrowing from other languages, can also give rise <b>to</b> <b>skewed</b> lexical similarities. It is important, therefore, to determine <b>to</b> what degree <b>skewing</b> is a statisti-cally significant indicator of borrowing. Here, we describe a statistical hypothesis test for detecting language contact based on skewing of linguistic characters of arbitrary type. Signifi-cant probabilities of correct detection of contact are main-tained for various contact scenarios, with low false alarm probability. Our experiments show that the test is fairly robust to substantial heterogeneity in the retention rate, both across characters and across lineages, suggesting that the method can provide an objective criterion against which claims of signi-ficant <b>skewing</b> due <b>to</b> contact can be tested, pointing the way for more detailed analysis...|$|R

On this topic, Les Roberts stated [...] "I emailed it in on Sept. 30 under the condition that it came out before the election. My motive in doing that was not <b>to</b> <b>skew</b> the election.

2500|$|Trivers and Hare (1976) {{proposed}} that the population-level sex-investment ratio equals the relatedness asymmetry, so there can be conflict between workers and queens over sex allocation. Thus, the prediction is that sex-investment ratios are 1:1 females:males if queens control sex allocation and 3:1 females:males if there is worker control. [...] This is because the queen is equally related to her sons and daughters (r=0.5 in each case), so she should produce equal numbers {{of male and female}} reproductive offspring. [...] However, because of haplodiploidy, full sisters are more closely related to one another because half of their genome is always identical, and the other half has a 50% chance of being shared. [...] Their total relatedness is 0.5+(0.5 x 0.5)=0.75. [...] This means sisters would prefer <b>to</b> <b>skew</b> the population sex-investment ratio to 3:1 females:males.

2500|$|In 1996, an {{outbreak}} of measles, cholera, and bacterial meningitis occurred in Nigeria. Pfizer representatives traveled to Kano, Nigeria to administer an experimental antibiotic, trovafloxacin, to approximately 200 children.

The nature and frequency of both fatalities and other adverse outcomes {{were similar to those}} historically found among pediatric patients treated for meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2001, families of the children, as well as the governments of Kano and Nigeria, filed lawsuits regarding the treatment. According to the news program Democracy Now!, [...] "esearchers did not obtain signed consent forms, and medical personnel said Pfizer did not tell parents their children were getting the experimental drug." [...] The lawsuits also accuse Pfizer of using the outbreak to perform unapproved human testing, as well as allegedly under-dosing a control group being treated with traditional antibiotics in order <b>to</b> <b>skew</b> the results of the trial in favor of Trovan. While the specific facts of the case remain in dispute, both Nigerian medical personnel and at least one Pfizer physician have stated that the trial was conducted without regulatory approval.|$|E
