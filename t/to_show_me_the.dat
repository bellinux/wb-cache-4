25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, {{and the sound of}} their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E

6000|$|She had {{recovered}} her composure; she looked straight {{past him and}} addressed Rowland: [...] "Be so good as <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> {{way out of this}} horrible place!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am expecting friends," [...] replied Yvonne bravely; [...] "they {{will be here}} very soon, {{and will}} gladly repay you lavishly for all the {{kindness}} which you may be inclined <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> while." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{you promised}} <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> all <b>the</b> {{different}} rocks and soils {{as we went}} home, {{because it was so}} dark when we came from Reading.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{needed no}} request," [...] said Clive. [...] "My going, Lady Kew, {{is my own}} act. I was going without {{requiring}} any guide <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He wants <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> way to High Wycombe," [...] she says. [...] "He {{will have}} it there are better shops at Wycombe. What ought I to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} near it," [...] I assured her. [...] "Anyhow, {{it would be}} an awfully good {{opportunity}} for you <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> sort of ring you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{just hope}} {{some of our}} boys do land, and that right away!" [...] cried Walter. [...] "Can't I get {{somebody}} <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> way to the seacoast?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{place would}} seem fearsome now," [...] she {{answered}} simply, [...] "were there a light <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> that <b>the</b> brave face of Roger de Conde were by my side." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want to get}} out of this," [...] said Graham to Asano. [...] "This is {{not what}} I came <b>to</b> see. <b>Show</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> workers. I want to see the people in blue. These {{parasitic}} lunatics--" ...|$|R
30|$|The Socratic circle {{approach}} {{as described here}} was introduced to me by another Peace Studies professor and colleague, Katie Zanoni. In addition <b>to</b> <b>showing</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> process she used in her class, Katie also shared with me an evaluation handout which {{the students in the}} outer circle would be asked to fill out while observing the discussion taking place in the inner circle. Each student in the outer circle is put in charge of carefully observing one student in the inner circle, filling out the evaluation handout, and giving their partner feedback and tips for further development.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{will be just}} {{light enough}} <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> way home," [...] said Miss Keeldar, as she {{prepared}} to take leave of Caroline at the rectory garden door.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'll {{climb up}} when I get back, then," [...] said the boy, with a laugh. [...] "Now, Eureka, you'll have <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> way to those wings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is he? Steve's {{the best}} pal I've got. For two years I've been aching {{to get at}} this boy, and Steve has had the sense <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{would only}} be for a little while,' sighed Phoebe; 'and Miss Charlecote is <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> all <b>the</b> museums. I should see more with her than ever I shall when I am come out; and I should be with Robert.' ...|$|R
60|$|Don. Louisa. He arrived but yesterday, {{and he was}} <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> from <b>the</b> window, as {{he visited}} my father.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{quite clear}} you weren't raised in Canada," [...] said Devine. [...] "You can worry out the thing during the {{afternoon}} and bring along any rough plan you'd like <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ranch this evening. That's fixed? Then there's another thing. Has anybody tried to stop you getting out lumber?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't {{know how}} to {{transform}} you; some one will have <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> way to do it," [...] protested Seseley, who was getting worried over the task set her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Got <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> roads," [...] said Jack Mason. [...] "All I know {{around here}} is the regular auto road to the White Mountains,-- and I don't know that any too well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{you did not}} promise him not <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> letter,' Dorothy said quickly, {{with the}} usual {{feminine}} perspicacity in discovering {{a way out of}} a difficulty short of telling an absolute untruth.|$|E
60|$|But I cannot but say, that I {{always looked}} upon this {{particular}} respect {{to be the}} effect of more than ordinary regard the great king of Sweden always <b>showed</b> <b>me,</b> rather than any merit of my own; and the veneration they all had for his memory, made them continue <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> all <b>the</b> marks of a suitable esteem.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are about}} <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> shadows of <b>the</b> {{things that have}} not happened, but {{will happen in the}} time before us," [...] Scrooge pursued. [...] "Is that so, Spirit?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Aria [...] - [...] tenore solo (Ó, cestu ukaž mi, jak jí mám dobýt / Oh, <b>show</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> {{way that}} I must win her) ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Oh, Mr. James!" [...] I said, [...] "if {{you love}} me {{have a cup of}} tea and some bread-and-butter sent up to my room, and tell the maid <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> way to it." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{day or two}} after, Bill {{dragged me}} {{stumbling}} over boxes and through straw and wrappings <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> glories of the parlor furniture, with which he seemed pleased as {{a child with a}} new toy.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If,' said he, 'you {{thought you}} could do so without breach of confidence, I wish you would have the {{goodness}} <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> letter of Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees. I desire to look particularly at the address.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is," [...] said Courthorne dryly. [...] "I'm much obliged <b>to</b> you for <b>showing</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> thing, but I'd {{be still}} more obliged if you wouldn't worry me with any {{questions}} just now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{is not in}} {{the least}} clever, and it is very impertinent of you <b>to</b> <b>show</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>The</b> drawing is not funny. It is simply rude.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} isn't {{currently}} {{available on the}} Internet, but when asked by a fan if such a video existed, James Ash stated [...] "The one for Need You <b>To</b> <b>Show</b> <b>Me</b> was <b>the</b> most exciting clip for me by far as it was my first! (And our singer, Jamaica, had a RED AFRO!) It's just Steve and I larking about pretending to be in SNATCH." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I have TWO feet," [...] replied Julia with spirit, {{though she}} laughed good-naturedly--"but {{here is the}} clerk, and he must not hear our quarrels. Have the goodness, sir, <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> handsomest pocket-handkerchief in your shop." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you've {{forgotten}} the rope!" [...] I exclaimed, {{and the captain}} opened his coat <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> line wound around his waist in such a fashion that one might have come close upon him without suspecting that he carried anything.|$|E
60|$|She smiled faintly {{and in a}} {{friendly}} tone, from which I concluded at once {{that she did not}} mean <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> girl's letter, she said that undoubtedly the letter disclosed an understanding between Captain Anthony and Flora de Barral.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{that more}} {{peaceful}} state, I have imagined her, in the moonlight, {{coming to me}} and taking <b>me</b> out <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> that <b>the</b> home of her married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My picture was in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active, cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All hail to thee, moon, all hail to thee; [...] I pray thee, good moon, now <b>show</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> [...] <b>The</b> {{youth who}} my future husband shall be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have treated}} me shockingly," [...] he declared, {{with a smile}} which was a little forced. [...] "You promised <b>to</b> let <b>me</b> <b>show</b> you <b>the</b> winter garden." ...|$|R
