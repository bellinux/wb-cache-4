5000|$|Concerning {{business}} travel, [...] "The ease {{of international}} air travel {{and the fact}} that, for most of us, the costs are met by our employers, means that ... globe trotting conference travel is often regarded as a <b>perk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> job." [...] However, <b>the</b> <b>perk</b> usually {{is not only the}} business trip itself, but also the frequent flyer points which the individual accrues by taking the trip, and which can be redeemed later for personal air travel. Thus a conflict of interest is established, whereby bottom-up pressure may be created within a firm or government agency for travel that is really not necessary. Even when such conflict is not a motivation, <b>the</b> <b>perk</b> <b>of</b> frequent flyer miles can be expected to lead in many cases to personal trips that would not be taken if a ticket had to be paid for with personal funds.|$|R

25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that gender typing is, in fact, not just related to {{gender-related}} characteristics that is congruous with the person’s biological sex, but rather holds different dimensions. Several studies have also revealed <b>the</b> <b>perks</b> <b>of</b> androgynous individuals such as having more adaptability towards gender-specific situations as well as more flexible attitudes about sex roles. Therefore, while there appear to be many benefits for a gender-congruent identity, it can also result in limitations. Because gender typing often reinforces stereotypes, it tends to attract negative and rigid attitudes towards atypical gender characteristics, activities, and interests. This reinforces the idea that gender-typing does result in certain limitations towards the construction of one’s identity.|$|E
