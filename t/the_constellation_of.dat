5|$|In 2010, Vesta reached {{opposition}} in <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> Leo {{on the night}} of 17–18 February, at about magnitude 6.1, a brightness that makes it visible in binocular range but generally not for the naked eye. Under perfect dark sky conditions where all light pollution is absent it might be visible to an experienced observer without the use of a telescope or binoculars. Vesta came to opposition again on 5 August 2011, in <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> Capricornus at about magnitude 5.6.|$|E

5|$|Gliese 876 d is an {{exoplanet}} approximately 15 {{light-years away}} in <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> Aquarius. The planet {{was the third}} planet discovered orbiting the red dwarf Gliese 876. At {{the time of its}} discovery, the planet had the lowest mass of any known extrasolar planet apart from the pulsar planets orbiting PSR B1257+12. Due to this low mass, it can be categorized as a super-Earth.|$|E
5|$|In astronomical terms, the Gliese 581 {{system is}} {{relatively}} close to Earth, at 20.37 light-years (192 trillion km or 119 trillion miles) {{in the direction}} of <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> Libra. This distance, along with the declination and right ascension coordinates, give its exact location in our galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Vega, also {{designated}} Alpha Lyrae (α Lyrae, abbreviated Alpha Lyr or α Lyr), is {{the brightest}} star in <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> Lyra, the fifth-brightest star in the night sky, and the second-brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus. It is relatively close at only 25 light-years from the Sun, and, together with Arcturus and Sirius, one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{earliest}} detected since time of detonation, {{and for which}} {{the earliest}} spectra have been obtained (beginning at 6 hours after the actual explosion), is the Type II SN 2013fs (iPTF13dqy) which was recorded 3 hours after the supernova event on 6 October 2013 by the Intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF).

5|$|Another {{conspiracy}} claim regards a {{patch of}} missing data in Google Sky near <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> Orion, which has often been cited as evidence that Nibiru has been redacted. However, the same region of sky can still be viewed by thousands of amateur astronomers.

5|$|HD 28185 b is an {{extrasolar planet}} {{approximately}} 138 light-years away from Earth in <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> Eridanus. The planet was discovered orbiting the Sun-like star HD 28185 in April 2001 {{as a part}} of the CORALIE survey for southern extrasolar planets, and its existence was independently confirmed by the Magellan Planet Search Survey in 2008. HD 28185 b orbits its sun in a circular orbit that is at the inner edge of its star's habitable zone.|$|E
5|$|In 1756, French {{astronomer}} Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille introduced <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> Circinus {{with the}} French name le Compas, representing {{a pair of}} dividing compasses, on a chart of the southern sky. On that chart, Lacaille portrayed the constellations of Norma, Circinus, and Triangulum Australe, respectively, as a set square and ruler, a compass, and a surveyor's level {{in a set of}} draughtsman's instruments. Circinus was given its current name in 1763, when Lacaille published an updated sky map with Latin names for the constellations he introduced.|$|E

5|$|Mu Arae (μ Arae, {{abbreviated}} Mu Ara, μ Ara), often designated HD 160691, {{also named}} Cervantes, is a main sequence G-type star approximately 50 light-years {{away from the}} Sun in <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> Ara. The star has a planetary system with four known extrasolar planets (designated Mu Arae b, c, d and e; later named Quijote, Dulcinea, Rocinante and Sancho, respectively), three of them with masses {{comparable to that of}} Jupiter. The system's innermost planet was the first 'hot Neptune' or 'super-Earth' to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Orion served several {{roles in}} ancient Greek culture.
