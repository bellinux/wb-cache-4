40|$|The {{study of}} the {{propagation}} of ultrasound within a gas jet is extended to obtain waveguide effects, where the jet collimates the ultrasonic beam from a transducer within the flow. Two methods have been investigated to achieve this-cooling the gas within the air jet, and using a different gas whose acoustic velocity is lower than air. Cooling an air jet to a temperature {{less than that of}} the surrounding air produced a noticeable waveguide effect. In addition, studies have been carried out using other selected gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO 2) with a lower acoustic velocity than air, and helium (He) with a higher value. The former gas enhanced confinement of the ultrasonic beam, whereas the latter caused divergence. An ideal solution was found to be a CO 2 /air mixture, which produced a well-collimated sound field along the axis, while limiting the excess attenuation of pure CO 2 gas jets. The effectiveness of the waveguide using mixed gas jets in producing images in air-coupled <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>solids</b> is demonstrated. (C) 2003 Acoustical Society of America...|$|E

Present ultrasonic non-destructive testing methods are very sophistic, {{but they have}} some limitations for practice use. For example, it is an impossibility integral testing procedure, time demanding or practically infeasible <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>solids</b> with inhomogenous materials or with complicate forms. In such examples {{it is possible to}} utilize measuration of non-linear effects of wave propagation and creation of higher harmonic signals in the vicinity of defects. This paper describes measuring set-up method for non-linear effects determination. First, the short summary and comparison of various methods of nonlinear ultrasound spectroscopy is shown. It was chosen the CV method with one pure harmonic exciting signal and with evaluating of 2 nd and 3 rd harmonic element as a quantity of nonlinearity. The corresponding measuring set-up is described. This method is practically applied to fried roof tiles because testing of this material is problematic by other NDT method. The selection of exciting frequency by analysis of frequency responses is shown. Measured spectrums for good tiles and for tiles with cracks shows usability of this method for rated aim.
