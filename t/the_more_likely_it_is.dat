5|$|Every {{game in the}} SmackDown vs. Raw series used to {{have the}} amount of damage inflicted to the player's chosen superstar, {{measured}} with a meter on the HUD, where a design of a male figure presented the damage. As a move was performed against a superstar, the affected area of the body flashed—the more damage that is done to that specific body part, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for the superstar to submit. Colors were used to represent the amount of damage done to a specific body area; yellow represented minimal damage, orange represented moderate damage, and red represented maximum damage. This was however taken out of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. Now {{the only way to}} tell how damaged the opponent is to watch their physical body actions that indicate how hurt they are. The more damage inflicted to opponents, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for them to lose the match. There are four ways to win a match in every game: by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout; alternatively, the match could end in a draw. With the introduction of an on-screen referee in WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, the ability to win by disqualification was also included.|$|E
5|$|Residual lead in soil {{contributes}} to lead exposure in urban areas. It has been {{thought that the}} more polluted an area is with various contaminants, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to contain lead. However, {{this is not always}} the case, as there are several other reasons for lead contamination in soil. Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, or pesticides used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters. Although leaded soil is less of a problem in countries that no longer have leaded gasoline, it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of urban agriculture; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard.|$|E
5|$|In Batesian mimicry, {{the mimic}} {{effectively}} copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, {{known as the}} model, to deceive predators into behaving {{as if it were}} distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity of the model and the abundance of the model in the geographical area. The more toxic the model is, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that the predator will avoid the mimic. The abundance of the model species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency dependent selection. When the model is abundant, mimics with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from the model are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where the model is scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little chance that they are the model species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the Papilionidae).|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>more</b> {{parameters}} {{that are}} included in a model, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> will fit <b>the</b> data. Models with fewer parameters are therefore preferred {{on the grounds of}} parsimony.|$|R
5|$|In the {{improved}} vigilance effect, groups {{are able to}} detect predators sooner than solitary individuals. For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, wood pigeon flocks are preyed upon by goshawks. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, {{the rest of the}} pigeons follow. Wild ostriches in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises it head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.|$|E
25|$|The pond {{level is}} {{controlled}} by the height of the pipe in the dam. Since beavers depend on water for their survival, the more a beaver pond is lowered with a pipe, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that the beavers will try to build a new dam to return the water to its previous high level. In addition, the more a beaver pond is lowered, the more valuable wetland acreage is lost. Therefore, it is important to lower a beaver pond only enough to resolve the threat to human health, safety, or property.|$|E
25|$|For {{a finite}} {{population}}, the population mean of a property {{is equal to}} the arithmetic mean of the given property while considering every member of the population. For example, the population mean height {{is equal to the}} sum of the heights of every individual divided {{by the total number of}} individuals. The sample mean may differ from the population mean, especially for small samples. The law of large numbers dictates that the larger the size of the sample, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that the sample mean will be close to the population mean.|$|E

25|$|Males of {{some species}} use bodily fluids, such as seminal fluid from their ejaculate, {{to aid in}} the {{coercion}} of females. Seminal fluid in males of Drosophila melanogaster may contain chemicals that increase the amount of time it takes for females to remate, decrease the length of successive matings, or keep her from remating at all. The less a female mates with other males after copulation with a male, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for him to ensure his paternity. These chemicals may also serve to increase the female’s reproductive success, but at the cost of decreased longevity and immune response.|$|E
25|$|With {{long-term}} use and during withdrawal of benzodiazepines, treatment-emergent depression and emotional blunting may emerge and sometimes also suicidal ideation. There {{is evidence that}} the higher the dose used <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> benzodiazepine use will induce these feelings. Reducing the dose or discontinuing benzodiazepines may be indicated in such cases. Withdrawal symptoms can persist for quite some time after discontinuing benzodiazepines. Some common protracted withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, depression, insomnia, and physical symptoms such as gastrointestinal, neurologic, and musculoskeletal effects. The protracted withdrawal state may still occur despite slow titration of dosage. It is believed that the protracted withdrawal effects are due to persisting neuroadaptations.|$|E
25|$|Lord Diplock {{explained}} that {{the rationale for the}} section 15 presumption was the difficulty in proving the purpose of trafficking. In drug trafficking cases, the strongest attainable evidence was likely to be the act of transporting the drugs. Regardless of this, his Lordship held that {{even in the absence of}} section 15, it could be inferred that the transportation of a large quantity of drugs was for trafficking purposes. As a matter of common sense, the larger the quantity, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for trafficking. Therefore, the appellants' argument that the Court of Criminal Appeal had erred in construing the presumption created by section 15(2) of the MDA was rejected.|$|E

50|$|Another {{problem with}} urine cooling {{is that it}} would become thicker. The longer that it had to cool down <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> was that <b>the</b> {{crystals}} in the it would bond together, causing it to thicken. This could lead to a false diagnosis, that is why doctors usually inspected the urine quickly.|$|R
25|$|In general, {{defining}} {{whether an}} individual is guilty of misconduct requires a detailed investigation by the individual's employing academic institution. Such investigations require detailed and rigorous processes and can be extremely costly. Furthermore, the more senior the individual under suspicion, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that conflicts of interest will compromise the investigation. In many countries (with the notable exception of the United States) acquisition of funds {{on the basis of}} fraudulent data is not a legal offence and there is consequently no regulator to oversee investigations into alleged research misconduct. Universities therefore have few incentives to investigate allegations in a robust manner, or act on the findings of such investigations if they vindicate the allegation.|$|E
25|$|As a result, widely varying principles, emphases, and {{definitions}} {{are used to}} determine local typologies among archaeologists working in the region. Attempts to identify and bridge the gaps made some headway at the Durham conference, though it was recognized that agreement on a single method of ceramic analysis or a single definition of a type may not be possible. The solution proposed by Dessel and Joffe is for all archaeologists {{in the field to}} provide more explicit descriptions of the objects that they study. The more information provided and shared between those in related sub-disciplines, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{that they will be able}} to identify and understand the commonalities in the different typological systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{meaning of}} the factor of (σ2/2)τ is {{relatively}} subtle. For dminus& and m this corresponds {{to the difference between}} the median and mean (respectively) of geometric Brownian motion (the log-normal distribution), and is the same correction factor in Itō's lemma for geometric Brownian motion. The interpretation of d+, as used in Delta, is subtler, and can be interpreted most elegantly as change of numéraire. In more elementary terms, the probability that the option expires in the money and the value of the underlying at exercise are not independent – the higher the price of the underlying, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to expire in the money and the higher the value at exercise, hence why Delta is higher than moneyness.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{trawlers}} {{store the}} fish they catch {{in some form}} of chilled condition. At the least, the fish will be stored in boxes covered with ice or stored with ice in the fish hold. In general, the fish are kept fresh by chilling them with ice or refrigerated sea water, or freezing them in blocks. Also, many trawlers carry out some measure of onboard fish processing, and the larger the vessel, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to include fish processing facilities. For example, the catch can undergo some preliminary processing by being passed through sorting and washing devices. At a further stage, the fish might be mechanically gutted and filleted. Factory trawlers may process fish oil and fish meal and may include canning plants.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} alcohol myopia’s effects on one’s {{decisions}} about how to react to sexual arousal is dependent upon the level of confliction one feels. The more intense the personal conflict {{of whether or not}} to use a condom, the greater effect alcohol has on the final decision to engage in risky sexual behavior. Intoxicated males who had felt heavily conflicted about condom use were least likely to use a condom. Those intoxicated men who had been less conflicted about using a condom were {{more likely to engage in}} safe sex. Therefore, some intoxicated individuals can actually be less likely to engage in risky sexual behavior than their sober counterparts, given appropriate cues. The effects of alcohol myopia on response to sexual arousal also depend on the level of sexual arousal. When sexual arousal levels were high, a greater percentage of men reported not using a condom than when arousal levels were low. This goes back to the importance of saliency in alcohol myopia. The more salient the external cue (in this case, higher levels of sexual arousal were more salient than lower levels) <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for alcohol to inhibit the comprehension of the consequences of an action.|$|E
500|$|The {{case was}} {{appealed to the}} Court of Appeal, where it was heard by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf; the Master of the Rolls, Lord Phillips; and Lord Justice May in February 2005.

[...] Fundamental constitutional changes could therefore not be passed using the Parliament Acts, including extending the duration of Parliament and abolishing the House of Lords. However, the Parliament Act 1949, as a [...] "relatively modest and straightforward amendment" [...] to the 1911 Act that did not [...] "extend to making changes of a fundamentally different nature to the relationship between the House of Lords and the Commons", was found to be within the scope of the Parliament Act 1911. The 1949 Act and, consequently, the Hunting Act were therefore held to be valid legislation and the appeal was dismissed.|$|E

500|$|The book {{states that}} Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and Robert Jastrow were all {{fiercely}} anti-communist and they viewed government regulation {{as a step}} towards socialism and communism. The authors argue that, {{with the collapse of}} the Soviet Union, they looked for another great threat to free market capitalism and found it in environmentalism. They feared that an over-reaction to environmental problems would lead to heavy-handed government intervention in the marketplace and intrusion into people's lives. Oreskes and Conway state that the longer the delay the worse these problems get, and <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that governments will need to take the draconian measures that conservatives and market fundamentalists most fear. They say that Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and Jastrow denied the scientific evidence, contributed to a strategy of delay, and thereby helped to bring about the situation they most dreaded. The authors have a strong doubt about the ability of the media to differentiate between false truth and the actual science in question; however, they stop short of endorsing censorship in the name of science. The journalistic norm of balanced reporting has helped, according to the authors, to amplify the misleading messages of the contrarians. Oreskes and Conway state: [...] "small numbers of people can have large, negative impacts, especially if they are organised, determined and have access to power".|$|E
500|$|The most {{reliable}} {{test in the}} diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis {{is the level of}} creatine kinase (CK) in the blood. This enzyme is released by damaged muscle, and levels above 1000 U/L (5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)) indicate rhabdomyolysis. More than 5,000 U/L indicates severe disease but depending on the extent of the rhabdomyolysis, concentrations up to 100,000U/l are not unusual. CK concentrations rise steadily for 12hours after the original muscle injury, remain elevated for 1–3days and then fall gradually. Initial and peak CK levels have a linear relationship with the risk of acute kidney failure: the higher the CK, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that kidney damage will occur. There is no specific concentration of CK above which kidney impairment definitely occurs; concentrations below 20,000U/l are unlikely to be associated with a risk of kidney impairment, unless there are other contributing risk factors. Mild rises without kidney impairment are referred to as [...] "hyperCKemia". Myoglobin has a short half-life, and is therefore less useful as a diagnostic test in the later stages. Its detection in blood or urine is associated with a higher risk of kidney impairment. Despite this, use of urine myoglobin measurement is not supported by evidence as it lacks specificity and the research studying its utility is of poor quality.|$|E
