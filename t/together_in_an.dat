The film stars Josh Hutcherson, AnnaSophia Robb, Robert Patrick, Bailee Madison and Zooey Deschanel. Bridge to Terabithia tells the story of Jesse Aarons and Leslie Burke, 12-year-old neighbors who create a fantasy world called Terabithia and spend their free time <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> abandoned tree house.|$|E
5|$|More {{complete}} aetosaur {{remains were}} found from the Lower Stubensandtein of Germany in the 1870s. Among them were complete articulated skeletons of 22 aetosaurs. These specimens {{were found in}} a large sandstone outcrop near Stuttgart and were preserved <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> area less than 2 square metres in size. The animals were probably buried under lake sediment soon after they died, with {{the flow of water}} repositioning their bodies on the lake bed and putting them in close proximity to one another. In 1877, German paleontologist Oskar Fraas assigned these specimens to the newly erected genus Aetosaurus. Fraas named the genus after the skull's resemblance to the head of an eagle, with a narrow, elongate skull and a pointed snout.|$|E

5|$|Some experts {{argue that}} exposing {{children}} to television {{at such an}} early age is taking technology too far or that parents are using BabyFirst as a digital babysitter. Parents in-turn refute that argument, claiming that experts have lost touch {{with the realities of}} raising a child. BabyFirst suggests the programming is intended to be watched by parents and their children <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interactive way. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against exposing {{children under the age of}} two to television, while a 2003 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that most children under two years of age are already watching TV. According to The Washington Post, very little is known about whether young children watching television has a negative or positive effect on them.|$|E
5|$|The {{neptunium}} carbides NpC, Np2C3, and NpC2 (tentative) {{have been}} reported, {{but have not}} characterized in detail despite the high importance and utility of actinide carbides as advanced nuclear reactor fuel. NpC is a non-stoichiometric compound, and could be better labelled as NpCx (0.82 ≤ x ≤ 0.96). It may {{be obtained from the}} reaction of neptunium hydride with graphite at 1400°C or by heating the constituent elements <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> electric arc furnace using a tungsten electrode. It reacts with excess carbon to form pure Np2C3. NpC2 is formed from heating NpO2 in a graphite crucible at 2660–2800°C.|$|E
5|$|A random {{assemblage}} of fish merely using some localised resource {{such as food}} or nesting sites is known simply as an aggregation. When fish come <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a shoal or a school depending {{on the degree of}} organisation. A shoal is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to {{the other members of the}} group. Schools of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.|$|E

5|$|After three days, {{unable to}} persuade {{his men to}} back down, Alexander gave Persians command posts {{in the army and}} conferred Macedonian {{military}} titles upon Persian units. The Macedonians quickly begged forgiveness, which Alexander accepted, and held a great banquet for several thousand of his men at which he and they ate <b>together.</b> <b>In</b> <b>an</b> attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects, Alexander held a mass marriage of his senior officers to Persian and other noblewomen at Susa, but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year. Meanwhile, upon his return to Persia, Alexander learned that guards of the tomb of Cyrus the Great in Pasargadae had desecrated it, and swiftly executed them. Alexander admired Cyrus the Great, from an early age reading Xenophon's Cyropaedia, which described Cyrus's heroism in battle and governance as a king and legislator. During his visit to Pasargadae Alexander ordered his architect Aristobulus to decorate the interior of the sepulchral chamber of Cyrus' tomb.|$|E
5|$|Although 1 ATF {{was well}} placed {{to deny the}} communists the use of its AO, it was {{increasingly}} obvious {{that there was little}} role for the SAS. Indeed, the heavy presence of Viet Cong prevented them from operating normally, and the first attempt to insert a patrol was called off due to the presence of hostile forces {{in the vicinity of the}} landing zone; two Viet Cong were subsequently killed and the patrol was extracted after only 30 minutes. A second attempt lasted only fifteen minutes longer, and they were also extracted following a brief contact. Finally, two patrols were joined <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> effort to provide more protection, and on 29 January they patrolled out from 7 RAR battalion headquarters. After only 30 minutes the Australians encountered a small party of Viet Cong; however, they tried again two hours later but were detected. The following day they tried for a third time and were contacted. Unable to operate effectively, the SAS patrols were withdrawn and returned to Nui Dat on 1 February.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets and an American {{group of}} architects each devised {{separate}} outlines for rebuilding {{the town of}} Spitak. Following an invitation by the Soviets for a critique of their plan, the American's proposal was ultimately accepted as the way forward. The new plan would deviate from Soviet styles that {{were found to be}} rigid and outdated, and would mirror characteristics of the local culture. For many years following World War II the Soviets practiced a methodical top-down approach to urban planning and building, constructing a large number of uniformly built row style apartment units, and the Soviets plan for rebuilding Spitak did not diverge from that approach. The Soviet's grid plan road scheme was found to {{not take into account the}} hillside at the new city's location, and the American's plan included finer details of how commercial centers and government facilities were grouped <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> open and communal style.|$|E
