This creates the characteristic flat-bottomed puffy shape associated with cumulus clouds. The height of the cloud (from its bottom to its top) depends on the <b>temperature</b> <b>profile</b> of the atmosphere {{and the presence of}} any inversions. During the convection, surrounding air is entrained (mixed) with the thermal and the total mass of the ascending air increases.|$|E

25|$|When two solid bodies come in contact, such as A and B in Figure 1, heat {{flows from}} the hotter body to the colder body. From experience, the <b>{{temperature}}</b> <b>profile</b> along the two bodies varies, approximately, {{as shown in the}} figure. A temperature drop is observed at the interface between the two surfaces in contact. This phenomenon {{is said to be a}} result of a thermal contact resistance existing between the contacting surfaces. Thermal contact resistance is defined as the ratio between this temperature drop and the average heat flow across the interface.|$|E
25|$|Cooling air is airflow that is {{injected}} through small {{holes in the}} liner to generate a layer (film) of cool air to protect the liner from the combustion temperatures. The implementation of cooling air has to be carefully designed so it does not directly interact with the combustion air and process. In some cases, as much as 50% of the inlet air is used as cooling air. There are several different methods of injecting this cooling air, and the method can influence the <b>temperature</b> <b>profile</b> that the liner is exposed to (see Liner, above).|$|E
25|$|The liner {{contains}} the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and cooling, see Air flow paths below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be cooled with air flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, air cooling is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) cool air from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of cool air that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of cooling air to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting <b>temperature</b> <b>profile</b> of the liner and the amount of cooling air required. Transpiration cooling results in a much more even <b>temperature</b> <b>profile,</b> as the cooling air is uniformly introduced through pores. Film cooling air is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less cooling air (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film cooling). Using less air for cooling allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|E

25|$|Driven by {{advances}} in technology and increases in manufacturing scale and sophistication, the cost of photovoltaics has declined steadily since the first solar cells were manufactured, and the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) from PV is competitive with conventional electricity sources in an expanding list of geographic regions. Net metering and financial incentives, such as preferential feed-in tariffs for solar-generated electricity, have supported solar PV installations in many countries. The Energy Payback Time (EPBT), also known as energy amortization, depends on the location's annual solar insolation and <b>temperature</b> <b>profile,</b> {{as well as on}} the used type of PV-technology. For conventional crystalline silicon photovoltaics, the EPBT is higher than for thin-film technologies such as CdTe-PV or CPV-systems. Moreover, the payback time decreased in the recent years due to a number of improvements such as solar cell efficiency and more economic manufacturing processes. As of 2014, photovoltaics recoup on average the energy needed to manufacture them in 0.7 to 2 years. This results in about 95% of net-clean energy produced by a solar rooftop PV system over a 30-year life-time. Installations may be ground-mounted (and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing) or built into the roof or walls of a building (either building-integrated photovoltaics or simply rooftop).|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} 1957, it was {{recognized}} that an increasing {{trend in the}} number of tropical cyclones each season in the Atlantic Basin was at least partially tied to increasing observations and better records.

[...] This is mainly due to a lack of satellite imagery and lack of reconnaissance aircraft prior to 1943. [...] An additional storm per year is likely missing prior to the advent of new technologies. [...] These technologies include satellite-derived Quikscat winds, satellite-derived <b>temperature</b> <b>profile</b> information, and Robert Hart's cyclone phase space diagrams, which have led to a recent increase in tropical cyclone detection.

2500|$|The next type of {{combustor}} is the cannular combustor; {{the term}} is a portmanteau of [...] "can annular". Like the can type combustor, can annular combustors have discrete combustion zones contained in separate liners with their own fuel injectors. Unlike the can combustor, all the combustion zones share a common ring (annulus) casing. Each combustion zone no longer has {{to serve as a}} pressure vessel. The combustion zones can also [...] "communicate" [...] with each other via liner holes or connecting tubes that allow some air to flow circumferentially. The exit flow from the cannular combustor generally has a more uniform <b>temperature</b> <b>profile,</b> which is better for the turbine section. It also eliminates the need for each chamber to have its own igniter. Once the fire is lit in one or two cans, it can easily spread to and ignite the others. This type of combustor is [...] also lighter than the can type, and has a lower pressure drop (on the order of 6%). However, a cannular combustor can be more difficult to maintain than a can combustor. An example of a gas turbine engine utilizing a cannular combustor is the General Electric J79 The Pratt & Whitney JT8D and the Rolls-Royce Tay turbofans use this type of combustor as well.|$|E

[...] According to this equation, the efficiency of separation is only limited by diffusion and is proportional to the strength of the electric field, although practical considerations limit the strength of the electric field to several hundred volts per centimeter. [...] Application of very high potentials (>20-30 kV) may lead to arcing or breakdown of the capillary. [...] Further, application of strong electric fields leads to resistive heating (Joule heating) of the buffer in the capillary. [...] At sufficiently high field strengths, this heating is strong enough that radial temperature gradients can develop within the capillary. [...] Since electrophoretic mobility of ions is generally temperature-dependent (due to both temperature-dependent ionization and solvent viscosity effects), a non-uniform <b>temperature</b> <b>profile</b> results in variation of electrophoretic mobility across the capillary, and a loss of resolution. [...] The onset of significant Joule heating can be determined by constructing an [...] "Ohm's Law plot", wherein the current through the capillary is measured as a function of applied potential. [...] At low fields, the current is proportional to the applied potential (Ohm's Law), whereas at higher fields the current deviates from the straight line as heating results in decreased resistance of the buffer. [...] The best resolution is typically obtained at the maximum field strength for which Joule heating is insignificant (i.e. near the boundary between the linear and nonlinear regimes of the Ohm's Law plot). [...] Generally capillaries of smaller inner diameter support use of higher field strengths, due to improved heat dissipation and smaller thermal gradients relative to larger capillaries, but with the drawbacks of lower sensitivity in absorbance detection due to shorter path length, and greater difficulty in introducing buffer and sample into the capillary (small capillaries require greater pressure and/or longer times to force fluids through the capillary).|$|E
