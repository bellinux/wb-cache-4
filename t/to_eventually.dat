5|$|Argentina, {{which had}} been {{insignificant}} {{during the first half}} of the 19th century, showed growth from the 1860s up until 1930 that was so impressive that it was expected <b>to</b> <b>eventually</b> become the United States of South America. This impressive and sustained economic performance was driven by the export of agricultural goods.|$|E

5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great Vowel Shift in English, which {{is the reason that}} the {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina <b>to</b> <b>eventually</b> become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E
5|$|During its operation, Virgin Atlantic Little Red's fleet {{consisted}} of four Airbus A320s wet leased from Aer Lingus under a three-year contract. The aircraft had 29 rows of seating with a 3–3 configuration, {{for a total}} of 174 seats. The fleet was painted with Virgin Atlantic livery with future plans <b>to</b> <b>eventually</b> repaint them with Little Red livery. However, due to the closure of operations, this rebrand of the planes never occurred and they retained their original livery.|$|E

5|$|From 1881 on, Pedro II's health began failing. He {{gradually}} {{withdrew from}} public affairs as time passed. Weary of being {{tied to a}} throne which he doubted would survive his death, he persevered out of duty and because there seemed no immediate alternative. Nor did his daughter and heir, Isabel, exhibit a desire to assume the crown. Both, however, were overwhelmingly beloved by the Brazilian people, who still supported the monarchy. The indifference towards the Imperial system by the Emperor and his daughter allowed a discontented republican minority to grow more audacious and <b>to</b> <b>eventually</b> launch the coup that overthrew the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Gates has {{credited}} {{the generosity}} and extensive philanthropy of David Rockefeller {{as a major}} influence. Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby {{they are interested in}} tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations. As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28billion to charity; the couple plan <b>to</b> <b>eventually</b> donate 95 percent of their wealth to charity.|$|E

The school, named Pentland Field School, opened to its first intake of pupils on 12 January 2015, and was officially reopened by the Permanent Secretary for the Department for Education, Chris Wormald.|$|E
50|$|When Germany invaded France in June 1940, the {{remaining}} British colony was evacuated <b>to</b> Gibraltar and <b>eventually</b> <b>to</b> Britain.

In August 1942, 600 Jews from Nice were rounded up by French police and sent <b>to</b> Drancy, and <b>eventually</b> <b>to</b> death camps.

5|$|In addition, Sarria gave a small {{selection}} of costumes, accessories, and documents to the Oakland Museum of California—including a cape and headdress {{that he wore}} in performances of his comic version of Aida at The Black Cat. Sarria continued to own a smaller collection of art, artifacts and documentation; he had said that he expected <b>to</b> <b>eventually</b> donate those materials to the GLBT Historical Society. An article published in The Atlantic in 2011 asserted that Sarria had also donated materials to the Smithsonian Institution. This claim appears to be erroneous, as Sarria stated in 2012 that he declined the Smithsonian's request.|$|E
5|$|In late June 1942, the Allies {{decided to}} seize {{bases in the}} {{southern}} Solomon Islands {{with the objective of}} denying their use by the Japanese to threaten the supply and communication routes between the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand. They also intended to use Guadalcanal and Tulagi as bases to support a campaign <b>to</b> <b>eventually</b> capture or neutralize the major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain. Admiral Nimitz committed much of the Pacific Fleet to the task, including three of his four carrier task forces. They fell under the command of the recently appointed Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, commander of the South Pacific Area.|$|E
5|$|In {{the interim}} period, work went into {{expanding}} the six lane freeway through Toronto and Markham. In early 1998, the MTO {{announced plans for}} two contracts to widen Highway404 south of Highway7. The first contract converted the grass median into an additional lane in each direction with a central barrier between them. High-mast lighting was also installed, replacing the unique luminaires used on the freeway. The second contract resulted in an additional lane in each direction on the outside the existing freeway south of Steeles Avenue, making it ten lanes wide. The proposal <b>to</b> <b>eventually</b> convert the inner lanes into HOV lanes was announced at the same time.|$|E

He played baseball throughout high school at Downers Grove North High School, becoming team captain as a senior. He was hoping for a college baseball scholarship but instead ended up receiving a four-year music scholarship at Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois {{where he was a}} part of the InterVarsity Christian Fellowship chapter. He graduated from Millikin in 1999.|$|E
