In other words, <b>transnational</b> <b>companies</b> represent today the main globalization initiator, player and beneficiary. The demonstration of the above said will be supported by several factors such as: the development of the financial-banking system, international trade, services and technology sectors.

The first section of the book discusses a world of single mothers struggling to feed children in families without father figures who are absent due to {{the civil war and}} the dire economic situation. Some of the characters are described as aunts who contemplate suicide as an escape from an oppressive system. The difficult life of the dockworkers of the banana company and their ambiguous relationship with the <b>transnational</b> <b>company</b> that simultaneously provides a living but also a dangerous workplace is treated in several poems. A section of the book discusses Honduran myths such as La Llorona, a crying female ghost who searches for her lost children, {{as a metaphor for the}} plight of single mothers without support. A scathing satirical part of the book presents the corrupt world of politicians who use tax money to buy luxury cars in a country with limited financial resources. The last section deals with the issue of the [...] "disappeared", individuals who have been politically assassinated by the military.|$|E
40|$|This article {{introduces}} the principal {{issues relating to}} the development of transnational collective bargaining. In particular, it summarizes the background and content of the juridical study undertaken for the European Commission, the so-called Ales Report, which suggested the mechanisms for an optional legal framework for <b>transnational</b> <b>company</b> agreements. We highlight four crucial questions: first, how to define, at <b>transnational</b> (<b>company)</b> level, the competent and legitimate workers’ representatives; second, how <b>transnational</b> <b>company</b> agreements can be effectively implemented; third, what systems and/or rules are suitable for the resolution of transnational labour disputes; and fourth, how <b>transnational</b> <b>company</b> bargaining can relate to other elements of the multi-level European industrial relations system. These same questions are addressed by other articles in this special issue, and we compare the answers they give with those provided by the Ales report. The lack of any legal form of internal regulation or external coordination seems to be the main feature of the upsurge in <b>transnational</b> <b>company</b> bargaining. This is likely to increase the already high degree of complexity inherent in the European industrial relations system: its multi-level governance model is characterized by task-specific jurisdictions, many jurisdictional levels and a flexible design...|$|E

In this context economic globalization and structures of <b>transnational</b> <b>companies</b> are crucial issues. Organizational and market networks replace the centralized corporation. However, the importance of headquarters is not vanishing. Therefore emerging organizational structures have to be analysed by means of both following dimensions: differentiation and integration as well as control. Within <b>transnational</b> <b>companies</b> various processes bring about standardization of work organization and deployment of labour in different national and cultural contexts. However, convergence of work organization does not imply the development of one global best practice. Rather, new methods originating from various national contexts keep emerging and spreading across boundaries at an increasingly fast pace. ...|$|R
