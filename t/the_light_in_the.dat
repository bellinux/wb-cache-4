5|$|In casting Glee, Murphy {{sought out}} actors who could {{identify}} with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Matthew Morrison, who had previously starred on stage in Hairspray and <b>The</b> <b>Light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Piazza; Lea Michele, who starred in Spring Awakening; and Jenna Ushkowitz, {{who had been in}} the Broadway revival of The King and I.|$|E
5|$|Even the maps, {{of which}} Tolkien {{originally}} proposed five, were considered and debated. He wished Thror's map to be tipped in (that is, glued {{in after the}} book has been bound) at first mention in the text, and with the moon-letters (almost identical to Anglo-Saxon runes) on the reverse {{so they could be}} seen when held up to <b>the</b> <b>light.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which would be difficult to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, Thror's map, and the Map of Wilderland, both printed in black and red on the paper's cream background.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{entered the}} Army of the United States in 1941 and was {{assigned}} to the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, a part of the 82nd Airborne Division. In 1944, as a first lieutenant, Thompson led his men during an air raid as part of Operation Market Garden. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jump bay of the platoon's C-47 Skytrain was later than expected, moving their landing zone from its intended location near Grave, Netherlands; the plane was passing over buildings when the paratroopers were signalled to leave the aircraft, and Thompson decided to wait until reaching several approaching fields.|$|E

50|$|All <b>the</b> <b>Lights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sky is {{the debut}} album by the English Rock band Area 11.

All <b>The</b> <b>Lights</b> <b>In</b> <b>The</b> Sky was written and produced entirely by the band themselves and released independently. Despite the band's strictly independent status, the album was a success and spawned a number of sell-out tours across the UK. The album's name, {{as well as the}} track Heaven-Piercing Giga Drill, are a direct reference to the Japanese anime series Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.|$|R

25|$|According to cinematographer Andrew Laszlo, the film's {{style was}} {{dictated}} by the story. The Richmond's look was very soft and the colors did not call attention to themselves. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Battery was contrasting and harsh, with vivid colors. Argyle prints and plaids {{are used in the}} Parkside District, and neon lights color the Strip.|$|E

50|$|Compared to the {{original}} plan, the designs of the balustrade, staircases, and roof were changed {{over the course of}} time.

25|$|In 1944, {{as a first}} lieutenant, John S.

25|$|The keeper was {{required}} to maintain the property, clean and whitewash the tower as required, and maintain <b>the</b> <b>light.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> years before electricity and automation, he was also required to carry the fuel up the stairs in buckets, and, twice a day, to wind up the clockwork-like mechanism -- with weights and pulleys -- that enabled the weights to rotate the lens. In 1875, the Chantry station's keeper was paid a salary of $400, according to House of Commons records.|$|E
25|$|The main {{materials}} {{used for the}} nano-studs are silver, gold, and aluminium, to name a few. However, gold and silver are not very efficient, as they absorb much of <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> visible spectrum, which contains most of the energy present in sunlight, {{reducing the amount of}} light reaching the cell. Aluminium, on the other hand, absorbs only ultraviolet radiation, and reflects both visible and infra-red light, so energy loss is minimized on that front. Aluminium is therefore capable of increasing the efficiency of the cell by up to 22% (in lab conditions).|$|E

50|$|Gnarrk's story began {{thousands}} of years ago. Gnarrk was a nineteen-year-old Cro-Magnon who was fascinated by <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skies. One night, a comet crashed before him, embedding a chunk of crystal into his chest. Somehow, this caused a transformation in him — it expanded his mind and his understanding.|$|R
25|$|The episode opens {{eleven years}} prior, with Emma Swan {{giving birth to}} Henry. As he is born, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{hospital}} begin flickering and fading. The doctor tells Emma that she can change her mind about giving the baby up for adoption, but Emma replies that she cannot be a mother.|$|R
25|$|The optics to {{distribute}} <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> desired pattern are designed into the reflector itself, rather than into the lens. Depending {{on the development}} tools and techniques in use, the reflector may be engineered from the start as a bespoke shape, or it may start as a parabola standing in for {{the size and shape}} of the completed package. In the latter case, the entire surface area is modified so as to produce individual segments of specifically calculated, complex contours. The shape of each segment is designed such that their cumulative effect produces the required light distribution pattern.|$|E
25|$|An Australian {{collapse}} {{after lunch}} {{on the fourth day}} meant England were actually leading by six runs after the first innings. With Australia needing to dismiss England and score more runs than them, England merely had to bat for as long as possible, denying Australia the time needed to force victory. Thanks to Kevin Pietersen's maiden Test century on the fifth day, and Paul Collingwood batting patiently for 10 runs in 51 minutes in the second innings, Australia were left with a target of 342 runs with only 19 overs remaining in the day. With Steve Harmison opening the bowling for England, Australia were offered <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first over of their second innings and accepted, leaving Rudi Koertzen and Billy Bowden to remove the bails at 18:17 BST to signal a drawn match and the series victory for England.|$|E
25|$|The photons of a {{light beam}} have a {{characteristic}} energy proportional to the frequency of <b>the</b> <b>light.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> photoemission process, if an electron within some material absorbs the energy of one photon and acquires more energy than the work function (the electron binding energy) of the material, it is ejected. If the photon energy is too low, the electron is unable to escape the material. Since {{an increase in the}} intensity of low-frequency light will only increase the number of low-energy photons sent over a given interval of time, this change in intensity will not create any single photon with enough energy to dislodge an electron. Thus, the energy of the emitted electrons does not depend on the intensity of the incoming light, but only on the energy (equivalently frequency) of the individual photons. It is an interaction between the incident photon and the outermost electrons.|$|E
50|$|After the {{dismissal}} of the midnight office all <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> church are extinguished except for the unsleeping flame on the Holy Table (altar), and all wait in silence and darkness.
