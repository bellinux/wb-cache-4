5|$|Coward spelled {{his first}} name with the diæresis ("I didn't put the dots over the 'e' in Noël. The {{language}} did. Otherwise it's not Noël but Nool!"). The press and many book publishers failed <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>suit,</b> and his name was printed as 'Noel' in The Times, The Observer and other contemporary newspapers and books. The papers of Noël Coward are held in the University of Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of these changes, {{publishers}} began introducing superhero stories again, a change {{that began with the}} introduction of a new version of DC Comics' The Flash in Showcase #4 (Oct. 1956). In response to strong demand, DC began publishing more superhero titles including Justice League of America, which prompted Marvel Comics <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>suit</b> beginning with Fantastic Four #1.|$|E
50|$|To date, {{there are}} 40 Italian “Alberghi Diffusi” http://travel.nytimes.com/2010/05/23/travel/23journeys.html, grouped under a National Association and 13 Italian regions have adopted {{legislation}} regulating the concept. Interest in the “Albergo Diffuso” {{has also been}} shown abroad, with Croatia and Switzerland adopting the formula in their own territory. Corsica is expected <b>to</b> shortly <b>follow</b> <b>suit.</b>|$|R
50|$|Following two failed {{assassination}} {{attempts in}} Rawalpindi, President Pervez Musharraf mooted plans in 2004 for GHQ, JSHQ, MoD and MoDP <b>to</b> finally <b>follow</b> <b>suit</b> {{with the construction}} in Islamabad of a massive new Pentagon-style integrated complex to house both ministries and the four service HQs, but this was subsequently cancelled in 2008 on cost grounds following Musharraf's forced resignation.|$|R
50|$|In October 2000, {{members of}} both the AII and IINZ voted to merge the two {{professional}} associations and the new name of the Australian and New Zealand Institute of Insurance and Finance was adopted. The Australian state-based Institutes, who continued <b>to</b> operate, <b>followed</b> <b>suit</b> in the next twelve months, becoming fully affiliated with the new body.|$|R
5|$|Prior to release, {{the film}} was {{involved}} in a controversy over plans by Universal Pictures to release it for home viewing on video on demand to 500,000 Comcast customers, only three weeks after its theatrical debut. Concern over the implementation's harming ticket sales and inspiring further films <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>suit</b> resulted in several theater chains' refusal to show the film at all if the plan went ahead, forcing Universal to abandon the idea.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} {{had been}} supportive of gays {{since at least}} the early 1990s, and following the late 2006 decision by the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards to allow same-sex commitment ceremonies, in 2007 Baith Israel Anshei Emes voted <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>suit.</b> The day before Yom Kippur, 2009, the synagogue was picketed by members of the Westboro Baptist Church, who shouted antisemitic and anti-gay slogans.|$|E
5|$|Around 02:45, several British destroyers {{mounted a}} torpedo {{attack against the}} rear half of the German line. Markgraf {{initially}} held her fire as {{the identities of the}} destroyers were unknown. But gunners aboard Grosser Kurfürst correctly identified the vessels as hostile and opened fire while turning away to avoid torpedoes, which prompted Markgraf <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>suit.</b> Heavy fire from the German battleships forced the British destroyers to withdraw. At 05:06, Markgraf and several other battleships fired at what they thought was a submarine.|$|E
50|$|As {{with many}} Koontz books, Midnight {{is divided into}} parts. Part One: Along the Night Coast, {{contains}} chapters one throughfifty-seven. Part Two: Daybreak in Hades, contains thirty-seven chapters, but is similar to Part One in that it begins with its own 'Chapter One'. Part Three: The Night Belongs <b>To</b> Them, <b>follows</b> <b>suit,</b> begins with its own Chapter One, and has forty-one chapters.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} closed west of Keswick in April 1966. The Keswick <b>to</b> Penrith section <b>followed</b> <b>suit</b> in March 1972, though freight trains {{continued}} {{to run to}} Flusco and Blencow (at {{the eastern end of}} the line) until the following June.|$|R
50|$|In the {{simplest}} {{form of the}} game there is no concept of a 'trump suit' that beats cards in other suits. A trick can only be won by a card of the same suit. When a player is not in position to win a trick there is no obligation <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the <b>suit</b> led.|$|R
5|$|Gregson-Williams' {{score is}} darker <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>suit</b> with the film. Gregson-Williams wanted Caspian's theme {{to convey a}} vulnerability, which would sound more vibrant as he became more heroic. It {{originally}} used a 3/4 time signature, but the opening scene required a 4/4 and thus it was changed. To represent Miraz's cunning, the heroic theme from the first film was inverted. For Reepicheep, a muted trumpet was used to present his militaristic and organised character. Gregson-Williams considered arranging his theme for a small pennywhistle, but found that it sounded too cute and broke the tension of the night raid.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the tornado in Comfrey there was {{uncertainty about the}} town's long-term survival. Then in the week {{following the}} tornado the town decided to rebuild the school, {{and as a result}} most of Comfrey's businesses decided <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>suit.</b> Ground was broken on the new school early the next year, and it opened to students on October 4, 1999. The population of Comfrey is down to 367 from the 425 it was when the tornado hit.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with only}} two {{teachers}} and 26 students in a single classroom in Towner Road, the new association rapidly expanded over the 1960s, building special schools at Margaret Drive and Jurong, a sheltered workshop at Geylang, a residential home at Tampines {{as well as their}} main administration centre, Lee Kong Chian Centre. SARC started a subcommittee for services for those with less severe intellectual disabilities in 1971 and a youth volunteering group the year after; the subcommittee was split into an independent organisation, the Association for the Educationally Subnormal (AESN), in 1976. In 1983 SARC launched the first early intervention programme in Singapore, prompting other organisations <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>suit</b> and set up an adjunct subcommittee that became Special Olympics Singapore.|$|E
50|$|If {{the first}} card played is trump, {{subsequent}} players must <b>follow</b> <b>suit</b> and {{also play a}} trump card that beats all previous cards if they can. It is called raising and applies only for trump suits. If non-trump was played first, and then trump, the player on turn needs <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the <b>suit</b> of the first card played and doesn't have to trump the card that beats the first one. The player who won the hand or trick collects the cards played in this trick and plays first in next hand/trick.|$|R
50|$|Eldest {{leads to}} the first trick, and the winner of each trick leads <b>to</b> the next. <b>Follow</b> <b>suit</b> if possible, {{otherwise}} play any card. The trick is taken by the highest card of the suit led. There are no trumps in the game.|$|R
5000|$|The British Socialist Labour Party and the WIIU {{saw their}} {{membership}} shrink dramatically after the war, as many activists joined the newly founded Communist Party of Great Britain. In 1923, the WIIU supported John Maclean's Industrial Unity Committee, which also advocated industrial unionism, but it retained significant {{doubts about the}} enterprise and left almost immediately. [...] The American WIIU disbanded in 1924, and the British group appears <b>to</b> have <b>followed</b> <b>suit.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} of Freemasonry considers the Liberal (Continental) strand to be Irregular, and thus withhold recognition. For the Continental lodges, however, having {{a different approach}} to Freemasonry was not a reason for severing masonic ties. In 1961, an umbrella organisation, Centre de Liaison et d'Information des Puissances maçonniques Signataires de l'Appel de Strasbourg (CLIPSAS) was set up, which today provides a forum for most of these Grand Lodges and Grand Orients worldwide. Included in the list of over 70 Grand Lodges and Grand Orients are representatives of all three of the above categories, including mixed and women's organisations. The United Grand Lodge of England does not communicate with any of these jurisdictions, and expects its allies <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>suit.</b> This creates the distinction between Anglo-American and Continental Freemasonry.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Ricciardo was {{the first}} driver to pit {{for a second time}} on lap 30. At the same time, a {{three-way}} fight had emerged for ninth place, with Pérez in front of Grosjean and Verstappen. On lap 32, Verstappen moved ahead of Grosjean and took another position from Pérez, who in turn lost another place to Grosjean in the same manoeuvre. Vettel made a pit stop for a second time on lap 33, prompting Rosberg <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>suit</b> one lap later. Hamilton briefly held the lead, but made a pit stop as well soon after, emerging to set a new fastest lap of the race albeit emerging behind both Ferrari cars. Lap 36 saw a collision between Pastor Maldonado and Marcus Ericsson, but both drivers were able to continue the race. Two laps later, Maldonado was in another fight for position with the other Sauber of Felipe Nasr, moving ahead. He ultimately received a five-second penalty for his part in the incident with Ericsson.|$|E
5|$|Potter {{either had}} no live {{models for the}} eastern {{chipmunk}} characters, or borrowed a pet chipmunk from a cousin. Initially, {{she may have been}} unsure of how to draw the chipmunks and chose to clothe them, then was forced <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>suit</b> and clothe the two main players as well, while leaving the other squirrels in their natural state. Or, she may have clothed Timmy and Goody because they collect their nuts in sacks (an unnatural way for squirrels to behave) in imitation of a ruse she employed in Peter Rabbit when Peter only walks on his hind legs while wearing his blue jacket. When he loses his jacket, he reverts to being an animal and moves about on all fours. Because Timmy and Chippy were not drawn from nature, the two suggest stuffed animals in their lack of engaging facial expressions.|$|E
50|$|The high bidder {{makes the}} opening lead, and the suit of this lead becomes trump. The hands are {{played out in}} tricks with {{clockwise}} rotation. A player must <b>follow</b> the <b>suit</b> led if able. If unable <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> led <b>suit,</b> any card may be played. A trick is won by the highest trump card in it; if no trump is in the trick the highest card of the suit led wins. The winner of the trick leads for the next trick.|$|R

5|$|Millwall, who had {{now also}} dropped 'Athletic' from its name, {{were invited to}} join the Football League in 1920 for the 1920–21 season, along with 22 other clubs, through the {{creation}} of the new Football League Third Division. The Southern League was shorn of its status, with almost all its clubs deciding <b>to</b> leave—Millwall <b>followed</b> <b>suit.</b> Millwall's first Football League match was on 28 August 1920 at The Den, and they were 2–0 winners against Bristol Rovers.|$|R
5|$|The Sonic X-treme debacle {{has been}} cited {{as a reason for}} the {{ultimate}} failure of the Sega Saturn. With the Sonic the Hedgehog series being attributed to much {{of the success of the}} company's prior system, the Genesis, and Sony and Nintendo both having flagship 3D platformers available early in the life cycle of their consoles (Crash Bandicoot and Super Mario 64, respectively), Sega was expected by fans <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>suit</b> and produce an official 3D Sonic game. With the game's cancellation, the Saturn never did receive an exclusive Sonic platform game, but rather only the Genesis port of Sonic 3D Blast; Sonic Jam, a compilation of the 2D Genesis Sonic titles; and Sonic R, a racing game. Sonic's debut in a full 3D platform game was not until 1998, with Sonic Adventure as a Dreamcast launch title, well after the discontinuation of the Saturn.|$|E
5|$|At the start, Nico Rosberg {{got around}} the outside of Hamilton in turn one, while Räikkönen lost {{positions}} due to a slow getaway. Sebastian Vettel got past Verstappen, but was immediately repassed on the approach to turn four. At {{the front of the}} race, coming out of turn three, Hamilton tried to retake the position from Rosberg. As the latter defended his position, Hamilton went off the track and spun and they collided at turn 4, ending the race of both Mercedes drivers. The collision resulted in a safety car period, with the order standing: Ricciardo, Verstappen, Sainz, Vettel and Räikkönen. The safety car came in at the end of lap four. Vettel got past Sainz on lap eight and Räikkönen tried <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>suit</b> two laps later, but was forced off track into turn two. He completed the move one lap later at the same spot. Sainz and Button were the first to come into the pit lane for new tyres on lap 12, followed by race leader Ricciardo one lap later, making Verstappen the first Dutchman to lead a Grand Prix, before he came in another lap later. When Vettel made a pit stop on lap 16, he emerged third behind the two Red Bull drivers, all on the medium compound tyre.|$|E
5|$|Both Ravalomanana and Rajoelina were {{requested}} by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to renounce participation in the 2013 Malagasy presidential elections in order to hasten {{an end to the}} ongoing political crisis. On 10 December 2012, Ravalomanana announced that he would not participate in the elections, and encouraged Rajoelina <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>suit,</b> in line with SADC recommendations. Rajoelina complied; however, when Ravalomanana's wife Lalao submitted her candidacy several months later, Rajoelina resubmitted his candidacy, declaring that Marc Ravalomanana sought to govern by proxy through his wife. In August 2013, a special electoral court invalidated the candidacy of Lalao Ravalomanana, as well as her chief competitors Rajoelina and Ratsiraka. TGV candidate Hery Rajaonarimampianina was elected president in January 2014, defeating Jean-Louis Robinson, the candidate of Marc Ravalomanana's camp. Upon attempting to return to Madagascar in October 2014 Ravalomanana was arrested, having been sentenced in absentia to lifelong hard labour for abuses of power by the Rajoelina administration. After his sentence was lifted and he was freed from house arrest in May 2015, Ravalomanana recommenced broadcasts at his MBS radio station, announced the re-opening of the TIKO business group, and was re-elected the president of TIM.|$|E
25|$|After the Ofoten Line, the Jæren Line was {{the first}} line in Norway to receive {{centralized}} traffic control, which was taken into use on 20 March 1964.

In 1966, 18 stations were closed, consisting of Maurholen, Vatnanot, Stokkaland, Hogstad, Stavnheim, Odland, Dysjaland, Kvia, Tårland, Gjerdo, Vardheia, Laland, Engjelsvåg, Orstad, Skjæveland, Lura, Luravika and Vaulen.

5|$|Financial {{integration}} among {{industrialized nations}} grew substantially during the 1980s and 1990s, as did liberalization of their capital accounts. Integration among financial markets and banks rendered {{benefits such as}} greater productivity and the broad sharing of risk in the macroeconomy. The resulting interdependence also carried a substantive cost in terms of shared vulnerabilities and increased exposure to systemic risks. Accompanying financial integration in recent decades was a succession of deregulation, in which countries increasingly abandoned regulations over the behavior of financial intermediaries and simplified requirements of disclosure {{to the public and}} to regulatory authorities. As economies became more open, nations became increasingly exposed to external shocks. Economists have argued greater worldwide financial integration has resulted in more volatile capital flows, thereby increasing the potential for financial market turbulence. Given greater integration among nations, a systemic crisis in one can easily infect others. The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of currency crises and sovereign defaults, including the 1987 Black Monday stock market crashes, 1992 European Monetary System crisis, 1994 Mexican peso crisis, 1997 Asian currency crisis, 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the 1998–2002 Argentine peso crisis. These crises differed in terms of their breadth, causes, and aggravations, among which were capital flights brought about by speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate currencies perceived to be mispriced given a nation's fiscal policy, self-fulfilling speculative attacks by investors expecting other investors <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>suit</b> given doubts about a nation's currency peg, lack of access to developed and functioning domestic capital markets in emerging market countries, and current account reversals during conditions of limited capital mobility and dysfunctional banking systems.|$|E
5|$|Sebastian Vettel slowly {{moved up}} the field, running {{eleventh}} on lap 18, only to spin a lap later at turn seven, falling back to 16th. He subsequently complained about a flat spot on his tyre, but continued without pitting. On lap 20, Sergio Pérez made a pit stop for new tyres and a front wing adjustment. Since the stop took longer than expected, he rejoined just before Sainz, Jr., who used the momentum to pass Pérez into turn one. Meanwhile, Räikkönen and Bottas were racing for sixth place. On lap 24, Bottas attacked around the outside into turn two, sticking to the inside line at the following corner, where Räikkönen did not back away {{and ran into the}} front-left of the Williams, breaking his own rear-right suspension and forcing him to retire on the spot, while Bottas was able to carry on. Rosberg came in for his scheduled pit stop on lap 27, while Hamilton waited two laps <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>suit,</b> trying to get ahead. This proved unsuccessful, as he rejoined behind Rosberg after his stop on lap 29. On lap 35, Sergio Pérez attempted to overtake Carlos Sainz Jr. for ninth, who ran wide and kept his position. After his team radio informed him that he had done so by going off track, he handed the position to Pérez. Sebastian Vettel made a pit stop for a second time on lap 37 and rejoined in between the two Mercedes of Rosberg and Hamilton, albeit a lap down. He was told to let Hamilton go by as well some laps later.|$|E
