5|$|Since the FairTax {{would not}} tax used goods, {{some critics have}} argued that this would create a {{differential}} between the price of new and used goods, which may take years to equalize. Such a differential would certainly influence the sale of new goods like vehicles and homes. Similarly, some supporters have claimed that this would create an incentive to buy used goods, creating environmental benefits of re-use and re-sale. Conversely, {{it is argued that}} like the income tax system that contains embedded <b>tax</b> <b>cost</b> (see Theories of retail pricing), used goods would contain the embedded FairTax cost. While the FairTax would not be applied to the retail sales of used goods, the inherent value of a used good includes the taxes paid when the good was sold at retail. The value is determined by the supply and demand in relation to new goods. The price differential / margins between used and new goods should stay consistent, as the cost and value of used goods are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods.|$|E

500|$|The Viceroy from 1869 to 1872, Lord Mayo, {{took the}} first steps towards {{abolition}} of the line, instructing British officials to negotiate agreements with the rulers of princely states {{to take control of}} salt production. [...] The process was speeded up by Mayo's successor, Lord Northbrook, and by the loss of revenue caused by the Great Famine of 1876–78 that reduced the land tax and killed 6.5million people. [...] Having secured salt production, British India's Finance Minister, Sir John Strachey, led a review of the tax system and his recommendations, implemented by Viceroy Lord Lytton, resulted in the increase of the salt tax in Madras, Bombay and northern India to 2.5rupees per maund and a reduction in Bengal to 2.9rupees. [...] This reduced difference in tax between neighbouring territories made smuggling uneconomical and allowed for the abandonment of the Inland Customs Line on 1 April 1879. [...] The tax on sugar and 29 other commodities had been abolished a year earlier. [...] Strachey's tax reforms continued, and he brought an end to import duties and almost complete free trade to India by 1880. [...] In 1882 Viceroy Lord Ripon finally standardised the salt tax across most of India at a rate of two rupees per maund. [...] However the trans-Indus districts of India continued to be taxed at eight annas (½rupee) per maund until 23 July 1896 and Burma maintained its reduced rate of just three annas. [...] The equalisation of <b>tax</b> <b>cost</b> the government 1.2million rupees of lost revenue. [...] The potential for salt to be smuggled from the Kohat (trans-Indus) region meant that the north-western section of the line, some 325 miles long from Layyah to Torbela, continued to be policed by the Department of Salt Revenue in Northern India until at least 1895.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{considers the}} net {{effects of the}} tax system complexity in Australia, at the federal government level. The net effects of tax system complexity have been defined as both the short- and long-term effects of <b>tax</b> operating <b>costs</b> on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Since annual estimates of <b>tax</b> compliance <b>costs</b> from empirical studies are not available, an alternative method to estimate <b>tax</b> compliance <b>costs</b> must first be provided. A state space and Kalman filter model was employed to estimate a series of annual percentage changes in tax system complexity. A series of annual <b>tax</b> compliance <b>costs</b> can then be generated based on tax compliance survey results for 1995 (Evans et al. 1997) and the assumption that tax system complexity fundamentally explains why <b>tax</b> compliance <b>costs</b> change over time. A vector error-correction model (VECM) was constructed to analyse the net effects of tax system complexity given that VECM can estimate short- and long-term relationships simultaneously. A series of <b>tax</b> compliance <b>costs</b> for the period between financial years 1965  66 and 2011  12, was generated. The simulated data show that tax system complexity is highly persistent. <b>Tax</b> operating <b>costs</b> {{were found to have}} a negative effect on the gross domestic product (GDP) in the long run. It was estimated that a 1 % increase in real <b>tax</b> operating <b>costs</b> can lead to a 0. 122 % decrease in real GDP in the long run. The short-term relationships <b>tax</b> operating <b>costs</b> and the GDP were simulated based on the VECM. An initial decline in the GDP in response to an increased <b>tax</b> operating <b>costs</b> was evident and was followed by a steady recovery. Approximately seven years after the initial shock, the increase in <b>tax</b> operating <b>costs</b> can contribute to the GDP growth, but this positive relationship slowly dissolved over time. Finally, it was found that tax revenue had a slow diminishing tendency, which suggests that existing tax laws eventually become ineffective in raising revenue...|$|R
