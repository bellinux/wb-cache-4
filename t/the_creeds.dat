50|$|Ecumenical creeds is an {{umbrella}} term {{used in the}} Western Church to refer to <b>the</b> Nicene <b>Creed,</b> <b>the</b> Apostles' <b>Creed</b> and, less commonly, <b>the</b> Athanasian <b>Creed.</b> <b>The</b> ecumenical <b>creeds</b> are also known as <b>the</b> universal <b>creeds.</b> These creeds are accepted by almost all mainstream Christian denominations in the West, including Reformed churches, the Roman Catholic Church, Anglican churches and Lutheran churches.

2500|$|<b>The</b> Athanasian <b>Creed,</b> {{also known}} as Pseudo-Athanasian Creed or Quicunque Vult (also Quicumque Vult), is a Christian {{statement}} of belief focused on Trinitarian doctrine and Christology. The Latin name of <b>the</b> <b>creed,</b> Quicunque vult, is taken from the opening words, [...] "Whosoever wishes". <b>The</b> <b>creed</b> {{has been used by}} Christian churches since the sixth century. It is <b>the</b> first <b>creed</b> in which <b>the</b> equality of the three persons of the Trinity is explicitly stated. It differs from the Nicene-Constantinopolitan and Apostles' <b>Creeds</b> in <b>the</b> inclusion of anathemas, or condemnations of those who disagree with <b>the</b> <b>creed</b> (like <b>the</b> original Nicene <b>Creed).</b>|$|R
25|$|The virgin {{birth was}} universally {{accepted}} in the Christian church by the 2nd century and, except for some minor sects, was not seriously challenged until the 18th century. It is enshrined in <b>the</b> <b>creeds</b> that most Christians consider normative, such as the Nicene Creed ("incarnate of the Virgin Mary") and the Apostles' Creed ("born of the Virgin Mary"), and is a basic article of belief in the Catholic, Orthodox, and most Protestant churches. Muslims also accept the virgin birth of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time Schleiermacher {{prepared}} his chief theological work Der christliche Glaube nach den Grundsätzen der evangelischen Kirche (1821–1822; 2nd ed., greatly altered, 1830–1831; 6th ed., 1884). The fundamental principle is that religious feeling, the sense of absolute dependence on God as communicated by Jesus through the church, and not <b>the</b> <b>creeds</b> or the letter of Scripture or the rationalistic understanding, is the source and basis of dogmatic theology. The work is therefore simply {{a description of the}} facts of religious feeling, or of the inner life of the soul in its relations to God, and these inward facts are looked at in the various stages of their development and presented in their systematic connection. The aim of the work was to reform Protestant theology, {{to put an end to}} the unreason and superficiality of both supernaturalism and rationalism, and to deliver religion and theology from dependence on perpetually changing systems of philosophy.|$|E
500|$|The Assembly resolved, {{after some}} debate, {{that all the}} doctrines of the Thirty-Nine {{articles}} {{would need to be}} proven from the Bible. Assembly members were prone to long speeches and they made slow progress, frustrating the leadership. The eighth of the Thirty-Nine Articles recommended the Apostles' Creed, Nicene Creed, and Athanasian Creed, considered to be basic statements of orthodoxy, to be received and believed. The Assembly was unable to resolve conflicts between those who would not be bound by creeds and those who wished to retain the existing language that <b>the</b> <b>creeds</b> be [...] "thoroughly received and believed". The [...] "excepters", who took the former position, argued that the articles only require the [...] "matter" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>creeds</b> be believed. On 25August the article was put off until the rest of the articles could be dealt with. This early disagreement on fundamental issues revealed deep rifts between different factions of the assembly.|$|E
25|$|Protestant {{theology}} {{since the}} reformation was largely negative on the term dogma. This {{changed in the}} 20th century, when Karl Barth, in , stated the need for systematic and binding articles of faith. <b>The</b> <b>Creed</b> is <b>the</b> most comprehensive – but not complete – summary of important Catholic dogmas. (It was originally used during baptism ceremonies). <b>The</b> <b>Creed</b> {{is a part of}} Sunday liturgy. Because many Protestant Churches have retained the older versions of <b>the</b> <b>Creed,</b> ecumenical working groups are meeting to discuss <b>the</b> <b>Creed</b> as <b>the</b> basis for better understandings of dogma.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>creed</b> is {{not meant}} to replace <b>the</b> ancient Apostles' <b>Creed</b> or <b>the</b> Nicene <b>Creed,</b> but to act as a {{supplement}} to these statements of faith. In practice very few United Church congregations use either of <b>the</b> traditional <b>creeds.</b>|$|R

500|$|World {{domination}} was the story's goal. The Creed {{was a way}} {{of achieving}} that goal without having to convert every tribe. The intent was for <b>the</b> <b>Creeds</b> to be hosted inside creatures, obtainable only after the creature was dead. Winning the game would require three Creeds of the same alignment and their placement in the volcano on the fifth land. The explosion would [...] "shatter the world" [...] and the world would be the player's. As the story evolved, it was decided that the game should not force the player through it, as it would restrict his freedom. The team also wanted players to explore the world.

For that reason a creed was called in Greek a σύμβολον (Eng. symbolon), a word that meant half of a broken object which, when placed together with the other half, verified the bearer's identity.
