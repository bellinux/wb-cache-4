5|$|Tropical Storm Beryl caused {{flooding}} {{in several states}} in <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>United</b> States in August1994. The second named storm and third tropical cyclone of the season, Beryl developed from an upper-level low pressure area over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on August14. Initially a tropical depression, the system intensified into a tropical storm about 24hours after forming. Beryl then moved slowly northeastward and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h) before making landfall near Panama City, Florida, early on August16. Within 12hours of moving inland, the storm weakened to a tropical depression, but persisted as a tropical cyclone {{for a few days}} while traversing <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>United</b> States. Beryl was absorbed by a frontal system while situated over Connecticut early on August19.|$|E
5|$|Although Josephine {{remained}} well offshore of <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States, the {{effects from the}} storm and an area of high pressure produced strong winds and high seas along the coast. In North Carolina, high tides caused severe beach erosion and minor damage to ocean-front houses. Minor coastal flooding occurred in New York and New Jersey. In addition, one fatality occurred when a man drowned after falling off his boat while sailing a river in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Frances {{then passed}} over the central {{sections}} of Florida, in the United States, three weeks after Hurricane Charley, causing significant damage to the state's citrus crop, closing major airports and schools, and forcing the cancellation of a collegiate football game. The storm then moved briefly offshore from Florida, into the northeast Gulf of Mexico, and made a second U.S. landfall, at the Florida Panhandle, before accelerating northeast through <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States near the Appalachians and into Atlantic Canada while weakening. A significant tornado outbreak accompanied the storm across <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States, nearly equaling the outbreak from Hurricane Beulah. Very heavy rains fell in association with this slow-moving and relatively large hurricane, which caused floods in Florida and North Carolina. Some 49 people died from the cyclone. Damages totaled US$12billion (2004 dollars).|$|E

5|$|The 1933 Chesapeake–Potomac {{hurricane}} {{was among}} the most damaging hurricanes in the Mid-Atlantic states in <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States. The sixth storm and third hurricane of the very active 1933 Atlantic hurricane season, it formed in the eastern Atlantic, where it moved west-northwestward and eventually became a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. A strong ridge over New England allowed a continued northwest course, bringing the storm south of Bermuda and later toward the middle coast of <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States. Advance warning allowed hundreds of people to evacuate ahead of the hurricane making landfall. It did so in northeastern North Carolina on August23 with winds of about 90mph (150km/h). Soon after, the eye crossed over Norfolk, Virginia, the first time that happened since 1821. The hurricane weakened into a tropical storm over northern Virginia shortly before passing near Washington, D.C., becoming the worst tropical cyclone there since 1896. Curving northward, the storm moved through Pennsylvania and New York before losing tropical characteristics on August25. Now extratropical, the former hurricane moved across Atlantic Canada, dissipating on August28.|$|E

5|$|The {{bog turtle}} is native only to <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States, congregating in colonies that often consist {{of fewer than}} 20individuals.

Bog turtles have sometimes been seen in cow pastures and near beaver dams.|$|E
5|$|The {{phenomenon}} underlying global dimming {{may also}} have regional effects.

Along <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> States, rough seas resulted in two fatalities and as the storm made landfall in Canada, heavy rains fell in eastern Maine. In Canada, Kyle had relatively little impact, leaving $9million in damages and no fatalities.|$|E
