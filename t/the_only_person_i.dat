2500|$|At {{almost six}} feet tall, Parr's {{strength}} {{was said to}} be one of her greatest assets. She was particularly noted for the power of her kicking, both in delivering from the left flank and shooting at goal. Team mate Joan Whalley later wrote: [...] "She had a kick like a mule. She was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> knew who could lift a dead ball, the old heavy leather ball, from the left wing over to me on the right and nearly knock me out with the force of the shot..." ...|$|E
2500|$|In one {{edition of}} The Mark Thomas Comedy Product, Mark Thomas {{investigated}} {{the practice of}} avoiding inheritance tax by declaring art, furniture, homes and land available for public viewing. After discovering that Soames was claiming tax relief on a [...] "three-tier mahogany buffet with partially reeded slender balustrade upright supports" [...] on this basis, but without making any arrangements for the furniture to be inspected by the public, Thomas invented a 'National Soames Day' on which hundreds of people made appointments to see the furniture. Soames subsequently decided to pay the tax on the item and Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, changed the law. In 2015, Thomas told The Independents Adam Jacques: [...] "I {{try to find the}} good in my enemies. It's not unusual {{to be able to get}} on with people despite what they are doing being awful. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> have met who I considered to be without any redeeming features was [...] Nicholas Soames. [...] He was such a pantomime baddie." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{ends with}} the song [...] "North Star," [...] {{which serves as a}} [...] "closing credits" [...] type of song. In regard to this track and Popa Wu's inclusion, RZA later remarked [...] "The idea is Rae did {{everything}} he had to do. Everything is over now. The job is over. Mission is over, it's a perfect closing to the album. Popa Wu was a very smart mentor in the younger days to me and ODB. Everybody had dibs and dabs of knowledge of self, I brought him in to be a mentor to these men like, 'I love them and you <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> know that have the intelligence to keep them in sync with knowledge.' It's very poisonous unless they got proper guidance. He was the smartest man I'd ever met at a certain time in my life." [...] Raekwon further commented [...] "'North Star' was a track I really, really wanted on my album. It was a track that I felt a vibe of it was motion picture-like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If ye cannot guess, I fear I cannot tell ye," [...] she said. [...] "I {{have eyes}} and the sense to see, {{but it would be}} {{presumption}} for me to tell ye all they showed me. Still, ye and Mr. Maxwell were not <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>persons</b> <b>I</b> saw that night at the Hallows Brig." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Frida," [...] {{the young}} man cried, bending forward and looking at her, [...] "you know very well you're <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> here <b>I</b> care for in the least or have the {{slightest}} sympathy with." ...|$|R

2500|$|Cougar Town {{was created}} by Bill Lawrence and Kevin Biegel. Following the {{cancellation}} of Dirt, Courteney Cox wanted to return to television and do another comedy. Lawrence, who {{is best known as}} the creator of Scrubs and Spin City, was approached by Cox about [...] "wanting to do something". While developing the concept of the show, Lawrence thought he would do a tryout with Cox on Scrubs, by guest starring in the first three episodes of the eighth season. Lawrence and Biegel, who worked together writing episodes on Scrubs, came up with the concept of the show with Cox as a 40-year-old newly single woman because he thought that it was a real [...] "zeitgeist-y topic". He drew inspiration from his real-life wife, actress Christa Miller who also stars in the show as Ellie; Miller had previously worked with Cox as part of the story-arc of the three part Scrubs tryout. Lawrence told Cox that the show could be [...] "high risk, high reward", although Cox decided to go for it. He added, [...] "I rarely have this much trepidation because usually <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> could let down is myself. I want to make it work for her." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{political}} comedy show, The Mark Thomas Comedy Product (later renamed {{as simply}} The Mark Thomas Product, to reflect its increasing political agenda) on Channel 4 earned him criticism from politicians but {{was seen by}} critics as a crucial investigative tool. In one edition, Thomas investigated the practice of avoiding inheritance tax by declaring art, furniture, homes and land available for public viewing. After discovering that Conservative MP Nicholas Soames was claiming tax relief on a [...] "three-tier mahogany buffet with partially reeded slender balustrade upright supports" [...] on this basis, but without making any arrangements for the furniture to be inspected by the public, Thomas invented a 'National Soames Day' on which hundreds of people made appointments to see the furniture. Soames subsequently decided to pay the tax on the item and Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, changed the law. In 2015, Thomas told The Independents Adam Jacques: [...] "I {{try to find the}} good in my enemies. It's not unusual {{to be able to get}} on with people despite what they are doing being awful. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> have met who I considered to be without any redeeming features was [...] Nicholas Soames.

6000|$|My [...] "Satire!"--I am glad it {{made you}} laugh for Somebody told me in Greece that you was angry, and I was sorry, as you were perhaps <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> whom <b>I</b> {{did not want to}} make angry.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Angela," [...] I said, [...] "I must {{talk to some}} one. I do {{not know}} whom to trust. I do not know who is honest. You are <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> whom <b>I</b> dare speak to at all." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rose has six [...] "half-siblings" [...] and she {{utilizes}} {{technology to}} feel {{closer to her}} family and friends [...] "back home". She says her grandmother is “probably <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> who <b>I</b> stay in touch with every single day. We talk and text a lot. A lot, a lot.” ...|$|R

6000|$|St. Aldegonde gave a long whistle, and he added, [...] "I wish Bertha were here. She is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> {{know who}} has a head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will {{undertake}} the business, sir. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> fear, {{in the smallest}} degree, is Balloba himself. I must disguise myself so {{that he will not}} recognize me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "I cannot {{write to}} her, for I {{am not sure}} that under the {{circumstances}} she would answer my letter. And I have already asked Mrs Null, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> other <b>person</b> <b>I</b> could ask, to speak for me, but she has declined." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it is past; on the contrary, I wish {{to speak}} to you; indeed, you are <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> with whom <b>I</b> could speak," [...] and she sat down.|$|R
6000|$|Nanda just hesitated. [...] "At {{the mere}} scale of it. I think it's splendid. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> whose astonishment <b>I</b> don't quite understand," [...] she added, [...] "is Cousin Jane." ...|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. I'm {{sorry for}} all the rough things I said to you, Daisy. I don't blame you for anything. You only acted {{according}} to your lights. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> can blame is myself. It's only reasonable that I should suffer the punishment.|$|E
60|$|CLARE. I came to Mr. Malise because he's <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> {{know with}} {{imagination}} {{enough to see}} what my position is; I came to him {{a quarter of an}} hour ago, for the first time, for definite advice, and you instantly suspect him. That is disgusting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I knew Akim Soushiloff and Petroff Stepanoff; but I {{had only}} been in their rooms once before, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> met there before was {{the young woman who}} called herself Katia, but who you say was {{somebody}} else. This was at the lodgings they occupied before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] he explained, [...] "I wasn't <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person,</b> present, and <b>I</b> hadn't {{arrived at}} the beginning. Somebody should have stopped the fellow; the shares he tried to work off on Crestwick were no good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She had a fancy, and I am sure I do {{not know}} any {{companion}} I could prefer to her. She is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> of whom <b>I</b> could truly say, that every time I see her, I love her more." ...|$|R
60|$|DESCENDING to the ground-floor of the house, I sent {{to request}} a moment's {{interview}} with the landlady. I had yet to learn in which of the London prisons Van Brandt was confined; and she was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> to whom <b>I</b> could venture to address the question.|$|R
6000|$|... "I’ll {{write to}} you when I’m fixed up," [...] said the skipper, [...] "giving you my new name and address. You’re <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> shall {{be able to keep}} touch with. I shall have to rely upon you for everything. If it wasn’t for you I should be dead to the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{like your}} friend much, papa. He is quite {{as quiet as}} you said; he is almost <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> have seen since I quitted England who has not jarred my nerves. I felt quite sorry that I had so long {{prevented}} you both from cultivating each other's acquaintance. He does not interfere {{with me in the}} least.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is of {{the utmost}} {{importance}} to me to know what is doing at Thorpe Ambrose; and it would be the height of rashness, while I am quite in the dark in this matter, to venture there myself. The only other alternative is to write to somebody on the spot for news; and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> can write to is--Bashwood.|$|E
5000|$|Following the album's aborted {{recording}} {{sessions with}} White, Smith revealed {{his desire to}} continue producing the band's material himself: [...] "We've had every modern-day producer flying at me like, 'Oh, this guy produced this band,' and it's some fucking band that I read about on Pitchfork two years ago. It's cool to get attention but, in the end, I'm a control freak and I have a very clear vision. I'm <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> who <b>I</b> can trust to produce this record." ...|$|R
500|$|Harvey has one older brother, Saul, {{and four}} nephews through him. She said in 1995 {{that she would}} love to have children, stating: [...] "I wouldn't {{consider}} it unless I was married. I would have to meet someone that I wanted {{to spend the rest of}} my life with. That's <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> who <b>I</b> would want to be the father of my children. Maybe that will never happen. I obviously see it in a very rational way but I'd love to have children." ...|$|R
60|$|You {{heard that}} Newstead [1] is sold--the sum £140,000; sixty {{to remain in}} {{mortgage}} on the estate for three years, paying interest, of course. Rochdale {{is also likely to}} do well--so my worldly matters are mending. I have been here some time drinking the waters, simply because there are waters to drink, and they are very medicinal, and sufficiently disgusting. In a few days I set out for Lord Jersey's [2], but return here, where I am quite alone, go out very little, and enjoy in its fullest extent the dolce far niente. What you are about I cannot guess, even from your date;--not dauncing {{to the sound of the}} gitourney in the Halls of the Lowthers? one of whom is here, ill, poor thing, with a phthisic. I heard that you passed through here (at the sordid inn where I first alighted) the very day before I arrived in these parts. We had a very pleasant set here; at first the Jerseys, Melbournes [3], Cowpers [4], and Hollands, but all gone; and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>persons</b> <b>I</b> know are <b>the</b> Rawdons [5] and Oxfords [6], with some later acquaintances of less brilliant descent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Drummond," [...] said Basil sharply, [...] "there are a {{great many}} good people, and a great many sane people here this afternoon. Unfortunately, {{by a kind of}} coincidence, all the good people are mad, and all the sane people are wicked. You are <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> know of here who is honest and has also some common sense. What do you make of Wimpole?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> {{called upon}} when I {{suddenly}} left England. I had {{no hope of}} seeing you, {{but it was the}} homage of gratitude and adoration. Great events have happened since we last met. I have realised my dreams, dreams which I sometimes fancied you, and you alone, did not depreciate or discredit, and, in the sweetness of your charity, would not have been sorry were they accomplished.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is no {{time for}} useless recrimination, or I would ask how you could leave one who has been a generous friend, {{helpless}} and suffering," [...] the girl said reproachfully. [...] "My father is evidently seriously ill, and you are <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> can turn to, for the hotel manager tells me there is no doctor within miles of us. So in my distress I must stoop to ask you, for his sake, what I can do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I thank God that I have emotions, and I don't mind if I do show them. <b>I</b> was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> who cried. <b>I</b> knew I should cry, and I brought three {{handkerchiefs}} on purpose. Look at them.' She {{pulled them}} out of her bag and thrust them into Dick's hand. 'They're soaking.' ...|$|R
5000|$|When Cole {{learned that}} Mitchell {{was writing a}} novel, she asked to see it, but Mitchell refused to let her or anyone else read it. Macmillan sent Lois back to New York in 1930, and {{promoted}} her to associate editor. Cole continued inquiring after Mitchell's novel, and in 1933 Mitchell replied that Lois {{would be the first}} to read it if it ever got finished. Cole introduced her boss, editor Harold Latham, to Mitchell in 1935. In April 1935, Mitchell gave him the manuscript to read, and Latham sent it on to Cole after having read the first few chapters. Mitchell later said that [...] "John and Lois are <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>persons</b> <b>I</b> ever discussed it with in any detail" [...] before she gave the manuscript to Latham. She continued to assist Mitchell and her husband John on one hand, and Latham on the other hand, in getting the book to a finished state. She edited the blurb, written by John, to its final state. Cole also promoted the book before its release, making sure that it was included in the Book of the Month Club selection. Finally, in April 1936, Macmillan produced the first printing of Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell.|$|R
5000|$|Adoor Gopalakrishnan in an {{obituary}} to Mankada Ravi Varma has said: [...] "I {{never asked}} him why he only worked only with me, as he used to say he wanted to do only good films. Raviettan is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> to whom <b>I</b> used to courier my script before they were made. His response and clarity on my script encouraged me a lot." ...|$|R
