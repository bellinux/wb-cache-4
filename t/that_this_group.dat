5|$|The jaguar, Panthera onca, is {{the only}} extant New World member of the genus Panthera. DNA {{evidence}} shows the lion, tiger, leopard, jaguar, snow leopard, and clouded leopard share a common ancestor, and <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> is between six and ten million years old; the fossil record points {{to the emergence of}} Panthera just two to 3.8 million years ago. Phylogenetic studies generally have shown the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) is basal to this group. The position of the remaining species varies between studies and is effectively unresolved.|$|E
5|$|The phylogenetic {{study of}} Alfredo Justo and colleagues showed that Volvariella earlei {{is closely related}} to Volvariella gloiocephala and <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> of species {{constitutes}} a separate lineage from the majority of the species traditionally classified in Volvariella. Therefore, this taxon was transferred to the newly proposed genus Volvopluteus. The specific epithet earlei comes from the surname of Franklin Sumner Earle, the collector of the original samples, to whom Murrill dedicated the species. The original specimens of this species are still preserved at the herbarium of the New York Botanical Garden.|$|E

5|$|Amargasaurus is {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the Dicraeosauridae, a family ranked clade within the Diplodocoidea. Currently, this clade consists of five species belonging to four genera. These are, besides Amargasaurus cazaui, the species Dicraeosaurus hansemanni and Dicraeosaurus sattleri from the Late Jurassic Tendaguru beds of Tanzania, as well as Brachytrachelopan mesai from the Late Jurassic of Argentina. Whitlock (2011) argued that Suuwassea emilieae from the Morrison Formation of the United States has to be placed inside the Dicraeosauridae as well, which was supported by subsequent studies. Amargasaurus is the only named dicraeosaurid from the Cretaceous; an unnamed specimen from Brazil indicates <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> persisted until the end of the Early Cretaceous. Most analyses find Dicraeosaurus and Brachytrachelopan to be more closely related to each other than to Amargasaurus. Suuwassea was recovered as the most basal member of the family. A 2015 analysis by Tschopp and colleagues came to the preliminary result that two poorly known genera from the Morrison Formation, Dyslocosaurus polyonychius and Dystrophaeus viaemalae, might be additional members of the Dicraeosauridae.|$|E

25|$|In the {{mathematical}} area of group theory, the Grigorchuk group {{or the first}} Grigorchuk group is a finitely generated group constructed by Rostislav Grigorchuk that provided the first example of a finitely generated group of intermediate (that is, faster than polynomial but slower than exponential) growth. The group was originally constructed by Grigorchuk in a 1980 paper and he then proved in a 1984 paper <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> has intermediate growth, thus providing an answer to an important open problem posed by John Milnor in 1968. The Grigorchuk group remains a key object of study in geometric group theory, particularly {{in the study of}} the so-called branch groups and automata groups, and it has important connections with the theory of iterated monodromy groups.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the combination of early-onset conduct disorder and ADHD may be associated with life-course-persistent antisocial behaviors as well as psychopathy. There is evidence that this combination is more aggressive and antisocial than those with conduct disorder alone. However, it is not a particularly distinct group since the vast majority of young children with conduct disorder also have ADHD. Some evidence indicates <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> has deficits in behavioral inhibition, similar to that of adults with psychopathy. They may not be more likely than those with conduct disorder alone to have the interpersonal/affective features and the deficits in emotional processing characteristic of adult psychopaths. Proponents of different types/dimensions of psychopathy have seen this type as possibly corresponding to adult secondary psychopathy and increased disinhibition in the triarchic model.|$|E
25|$|Studies show <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> {{is shaped}} by several forces. A major {{influence}} is the fact of frequent moves, as the family follows the military member-parent (or in some cases, both parents who are military members) who is transferred from military base to military base, each move usually being {{hundreds or thousands of}} miles in distance. Other shaping forces include a culture of resilience and adaptivity, constant loss of friendship ties, a facility or knack for making new friends, never having a hometown, and extensive exposure to foreign cultures and languages while living overseas or {{to a wide range of}} regional cultural differences due to living in a variety of different American regions. Additional influences include living in a series of military bases serving as community centers, the pervasive military culture on those bases, the absence of a parent due to deployments, the threat of parental loss in war, stresses associated with the psychological aftermath of war (living with war-affected returning veteran parents) and the militarization of the family unit (children being treated to some degree like soldiers and being subjected to military regimentation, inculcation into a warrior code of honor and service, frequent exposure to patriotic ideas and symbols, experience of free medical care, and military discipline). Military brats receive completely free medical care until their soldier-parent leaves the service (without a full combat related disability) or they reach the age of 21 or age 23 (depending on the parent's branch of service) if enrolled in college full-time.|$|E

500|$|Archaea {{were first}} {{classified}} as a separate group of prokaryotes in 1977 by Carl Woese and George E. Fox in phylogenetic trees based on the sequences of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes.

Woese argued <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> of prokaryotes is a fundamentally different sort of life.

40|$|Spatial {{arrangement}} {{is known to}} influence enumeration times in vision. In haptic enumeration, {{it has been shown}} that dividing the total number of items over the two hands can speed up enumeration. Here we investigated how spatial arrangement of items and non-items presented to the individual fingers impacts enumeration times. More specifically, we tested whether grouping by proximity facilitates haptic serial enumeration (counting). Participants were asked to report the number of tangible items, amongst non-items, presented to the finger pads of both hands. In the first experiment, we divided the tangible items in one, two, or three groups that were defined by proximity (i. e., one nonitem in between two groups) and found that number of groups and not number of items were the critical factor in enumeration times. In a second experiment, we found <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>grouping</b> even takes place when groups extend across fingers of both hands. These results suggest that grouping by proximity affects haptic serial enumeration and <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>grouping</b> takes place on a spatial level possibly in addition to the somatotopic level. Our results support the idea that grouping by proximity, a principle introduced in vision, also greatly affects haptic processing of spatial information...|$|R
