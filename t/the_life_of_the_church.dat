While Holy Orders are reserved for men, Catholic women have played diverse roles in <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> with religious institutes providing a formal space for their participation and convents providing spaces for their self-government, prayer and influence through many centuries. Religious sisters and nuns have been extensively involved in developing and running the Church's worldwide health and education service networks.|$|E
5|$|Commemorations are for {{individuals}} or events {{which have been}} noteworthy in <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> and {{in the history of}} Lutheranism in particular. These days do not take precedence over any other festival day, {{and if there is a}} conflict between a commemoration and a festival of any other rank, the commemoration is generally transferred to the next open weekday. If a commemoration falls on a Sunday where the color of the day is green, the collect for which that individual or event belong to could be said before the daily collect/prayer of the day or in place of it. For example, if September 13 fell on a Sunday and there was a desire to commemorate St. John Chrysostom, the pastor would recite the common of theologians and then the prayer of the day or the common of theologians on its own. The person may also be mentioned by name in the prayers of the faithful in addition to recitation of the applicable collect. Finally, their lives might be summarized or their teachings related to the day's lessons in some way.|$|E

The services were led by Rev. Matthew Hodge who was asked to cut-short his journey to Victoria (from England) and stay in South Australia instead. His first service was held on 30 September 1849 in the sail loft, but later that year a small stone church was built on the corner of St Vincent and Lipson Streets.|$|E
25|$|Members {{commonly}} {{believe that}} sacraments (or ordinances) express the abiding presence of God in <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> {{its members and}} priesthood. Sacraments are considered metaphorical acts designed to create and renew a person's spiritual relationship with God. Sacraments are viewed as covenants with God in response to God's grace. Community of Christ practices eight sacraments: baptism, confirmation, blessing of children, The Lord's Supper, marriage, ministration to the sick, ordination, and Evangelist's Blessing. Laying on of hands is used in confirmation, ordination, the blessing of children, ministration to the sick, and Evangelist's blessing.|$|E
25|$|The higher {{prominence}} given {{today to}} the presence of homosexual clergy, including bishops, in <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> reflects broader issues, both socially and ecclesiologically (see List of Christian denominational positions on homosexuality), concerning issues of social tolerance and the relationship between social change and doctrinal development. The issue has attracted greater attention in recent years following the development of the gay rights movement, and the increasing discussion within some Christian churches over the legitimacy of gay clergy in senior positions. Most notably in the selection of Gene Robinson as the Episcopal Bishop of New Hampshire in 2003, prompting wider debate across the Anglican Communion.|$|E

40|$|Three high {{temperature}} gear materials were evaluated using spur gear surface fatigue tests.

25|$|For {{many years}} of the Church's history, celibacy was {{considered}} optional. Based on the customs of the times, it is assumed by many {{that most of the}} Apostles, such as Peter, were married and had families. It is clear from the New Testament (Mk 1:29–31; Mt 8:14–15; Lk 4:38–39; 1 Tim 3:2, 12; Tit 1:6) that at least Peter had been married, and that bishops, presbyters and deacons of the Early Church were often married as well. It is also clear from epigraphy, the testimony of the Church Fathers, synodal legislation, papal decretals and other sources that in the following centuries a married clergy, in greater or lesser numbers, was a normal feature of <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church.</b> Celibacy was not required for those ordained, but still was a discipline practised in the early Church, particularly by those in the monastic life.|$|E
25|$|Church {{teaching}} is that Orthodox Christians, through baptism, enter {{a new life}} of salvation through repentance whose purpose is {{to share in the}} life of God through the work of the Holy Spirit. The Orthodox Christian life is a spiritual pilgrimage in which each person, through the imitation of Christ and hesychasm, cultivates the practice of unceasing prayer. Each life occurs within <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> {{as a member of the}} body of Christ. It is then through the fire of God's love in the action of the Holy Spirit that each member becomes more holy, more wholly unified with Christ, starting in this life and continuing in the next. The Church teaches that everyone, being born in God's image, is called to theosis, fulfillment of the image in likeness to God. God the creator, having divinity by nature, offers each person participation in divinity by cooperatively accepting His gift of grace.|$|E
25|$|A new denomination, the Metropolitan Community Church (40,000 members), {{has also}} come into {{existence}} specifically {{to serve the}} Christian LGBT community. However, individual Christians maintain a variety of beliefs on this subject {{that may or may}} not correspond to their official church doctrines. Some mainline Protestant denominations in the United States have also removed language in their bylaws which suggest that homosexuality is a sinful state of being. The Book of Order used by the PCUSA reflects this change. Similar modifications in position can also be seen in the Lutheran ELCA and Disciples of Christ. Although acceptance of sexually active LGBT laity has increased in terms of actual practice and in terms of church law, some of these denominations continue to limit leadership and clergy roles for LGBT persons. A number of denominations, like the aforementioned United Methodists, remain divided over the issues relating to homosexuality, with a large number of members pushing for changes in the church's Book of Discipline to allow for full inclusion of LGBT persons in <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church.</b>|$|E
