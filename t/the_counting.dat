5|$|After {{a player}} makes the first baza, that player {{is allowed to}} {{announce}} declarations. Declaring is allowed until the last two cards are left in the stock (the last faced-down card, and the faced-up trump below it). After these final two cards are picked up, all of the cards the players hold must be played in order to finish the round. When the round is over, the players start to count their scores (see Scoring below). After <b>the</b> <b>counting</b> ends, and their scores are calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stock to be dealt {{at the start of}} the next round.|$|E
5|$|Alvarez {{proposed}} Muon tomography in 1965 {{to search}} the Egyptian pyramids for unknown chambers. Using naturally occurring cosmic rays, his scheme was to place spark chambers, standard equipment in the high-energy particle physics of this time, beneath the second pyramid of Chephren in a known chamber. By measuring <b>the</b> <b>counting</b> rate of the cosmic rays in different directions the detector would reveal the existence of any void in the overlaying rock structure.|$|E
5|$|In {{both the}} 2008 and 2006 United States House of Representatives elections, Kilroy was {{involved}} in close elections for Ohio's 15th congressional district. She lost in 2006 after an election that required <b>the</b> <b>counting</b> of absentee ballots and election recounts. However, after the incumbent retired, she won a similarly close election in 2008. In both cases, she was behind after the Election Day vote tabulations, but made up significant ground with belated absentee ballot voting results. The 2010 election race was widely followed in the mainstream press as a race that the Republicans were targeting.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>counting</b> {{of votes}} took one month, {{and the final}} results were {{announced}} on 5 May, one week later than was initially scheduled. Of 148,000,369 registered voters, 124,420,339 ballots (84.06 percent) were submitted. Of these ballots, 113,462,414 were considered valid, and 10,957,925 were declared invalid. In the People's Representative Council, the Party of the Functional Groups (Golkar) received the most number of seats. It had previously lost to the Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle in the 1999 legislative election after being in power since 1970. However, fourteen of the twenty-four participating parties refused to certify the election results after allegations of irregular vote counting.|$|E
5|$|The {{first presidential}} term {{and the first}} vice presidential term both officially started on March 4, 1789, the date set by the Congress of the Confederation for the {{beginning}} of operations of the federal government under the new U.S. Constitution. However, due to a delay in <b>the</b> <b>counting</b> and certification of the electoral votes, which was not done until April 6 (because although the Senate of the 1st Congress initially convened on March 4, it did not achieve a quorum until April 6, and so could not conduct business), they commenced several weeks late. Adams first presided over the Senate on April 21. Washington was inaugurated into office on April 30.|$|E
5|$|When {{all four}} cards of the trick {{are on the}} table, the pair that played the card with the strongest card wins the hand. The trump suit beats the other three suits, with the ranking of trump cards from strongest to weakest as follows: Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. The next strongest suit is the one the first player played, again with the card rankings being Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. Cards {{of the other two}} suits always lose to trumps and the first player's suit. The winning team places the four cards from the trick into their baza. The rules for the {{declarations}} are similar to Two-player Tute, but it is mandatory to declare the cards after a player or the partner begins a baza. Only the scoring team can declare. To declare their cards, the opposing team has to begin a baza. Declaring cards in the plays that follow the beginning of a baza is not allowed. After the hand is over, <b>the</b> <b>counting</b> starts (see Scoring below). When <b>the</b> <b>counting</b> ends, and after the score is calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stack to be dealt {{at the start of the}} next round. The deal of cards rotates counter-clockwise during the subsequent hands.|$|E
50|$|Above the big wheel, <b>the</b> <b>count</b> {{wheel is}} mounted {{on the front of}} the clock outside the clock frame. <b>The</b> <b>count</b> wheel has 78 teeth on the outside, and the 12 notches are on the inside of <b>the</b> <b>count</b> wheel. <b>The</b> main arbor has an 8-tooth pinion which drives <b>the</b> <b>count</b> wheel. This {{directly}} reflects the ratio of strikes to lifting pins on the main wheel, as each turn of <b>the</b> <b>count</b> wheel has to produce 78 strikes (the total of numbers 1 through 12). One turn of <b>the</b> <b>count</b> wheel is equal to 9¾ turns of the big wheel.|$|R

5|$|All officers, clerks, interpreters, {{candidates}} and candidates' agents at polling stations must maintain the secrecy of voting in stations. Before the poll is closed, {{they must not}} communicate to anyone the name of any elector who has not yet voted or his or her or identification number on the electoral register. They are prohibited from communicating information obtained during <b>the</b> <b>counting</b> of votes as to which candidate has been voted for in any particular ballot paper. Furthermore, no person is allowed {{to try to find}} out from within a polling station who a voter intends to vote for or has voted for, or to communicate with a voter after he has been given a ballot paper but before he has placed it in a ballot box.|$|E
5|$|Mathematicians became {{interested}} in mirror symmetry around 1990 when physicists Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes showed that mirror symmetry {{could be used to}} solve problems in enumerative geometry that had resisted solution for decades or more. These results were presented to mathematicians at a conference at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, California in May 1991. During this conference, it was noticed that one of the numbers Candelas had computed for <b>the</b> <b>counting</b> of rational curves disagreed with the number obtained by Norwegian mathematicians Geir Ellingsrud and Stein Arild Strømme using ostensibly more rigorous techniques. Many mathematicians at the conference assumed that Candelas's work contained a mistake since it was not based on rigorous mathematical arguments. However, after examining their solution, Ellingsrud and Strømme discovered an error in their computer code and, upon fixing the code, they got an answer that agreed with the one obtained by Candelas and his collaborators.|$|E
5|$|On July 5, 1861, at {{nineteen}} Myers {{became a}} teller and cashier at the Mohawk Valley Bank. General Francis E. Spinner was the {{treasurer of the}} bank at the time. His first year as a trainee was without pay. Myers then received a salary of $100 per year, being higher than normal since he put in extra attention to his work habits. He opened his own little telegraph office in July 1863 within <b>the</b> <b>counting</b> office of the bank. This was the first telegraph office for the town of Mohawk, New York. He constructed all the necessary telegraph equipment needed and taught himself Morse code. Myers' income from this bank telegraph business was one-half of his total income. He eventually {{had to give up}} being a part-time telegraph operator within the bank, as his bank responsibilities took up most of his time. He turned over the telegraph business to the local post office with Austin Shall as the operator.|$|E

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue is typically made clinically, {{on the basis}} of reported symptoms and physical examination; this applies especially in endemic areas. However, early disease can be difficult to differentiate from other viral infections. A probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following: nausea and vomiting, rash, generalized pains, low white blood cell count, positive tourniquet test, or any warning sign (see table) in someone who lives in an endemic area. Warning signs typically occur before the onset of severe dengue. The tourniquet test, which is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory investigations are readily available, involves the application of a blood pressure cuff at between the diastolic and systolic pressure for five minutes, followed by <b>the</b> <b>counting</b> of any petechial hemorrhages; a higher number makes a {{diagnosis of}} dengue more likely with the cut off being more than 10 to 20 per 1inch2 (6.25cm2).|$|E
5|$|The Berlin Wall was a {{specific}} {{piece of the}} Inner Border that became the physical embodiment of the Iron Curtain that stood between East Germany and West Germany in the decades following the conclusion of World War II. The Berlin Wall stretched approximately 28 miles (45km) through the city of Berlin and another 75 miles (120km) {{around the edges of}} West Berlin and stood close to 15 feet (5 meters) in height. The sheer physical stature of the Berlin Wall in addition to becoming an iconic, international symbol of the Cold War and its virtues, drove it to become a popular site of tourism throughout its existence, and even after its dismantling. Tourism of the Berlin Wall reached its height in 1961, although an exact number cannot be given for the number of visitors to the Berlin Wall, as there were no official records of tourism to the site made at the time. Estimates, however, are provided through <b>the</b> <b>counting</b> of tourists by Western and Eastern border guards. The numbers obtained from the border guards suggest that Berlin Wall tourism was a popular outing for German people and foreigners alike, it is reported that the Berlin Wall received approximately 1.65 million tourists in 1969 alone, with around 23,000 of those being foreign visitors. Day trips were the most popular of the ways to visit the Berlin Wall, which could be conducted even through organized tours that were governmentally funded, so long as they were presented as educational in nature.|$|E
