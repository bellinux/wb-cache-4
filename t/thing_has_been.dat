5|$|With The Evil Thing destroyed, Max, Sean and Cassie save Priscilla. She angrily {{yells at}} Cassie and calls her a witch, and Sean rejects Priscilla {{in favor of}} Cassie. After Priscilla leaves, they save the pizza {{delivery}} man, who offers them free pizza in return for releasing him, then follows Priscilla to hit on her, to her disgust. Cassie and Sean burn the book and set aside all their thoughts about The Evil Thing. Sean leaves shortly afterward. Cassie and Max's parents then come home and find the book in the fireplace. The father mockingly reads it out loud, reviving The Evil Thing. The film concludes with Cassie realizing that The Evil <b>Thing</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> brought back to life {{and that it is}} not over yet.|$|E

Alongside this, unofficial mods are possible, leading to extra props, sets, animations, scenes, and clothing designs.|$|E

25|$|According to the Mrs Ws, the Black Thing is {{the source}} of all evil in the universe, and little more is {{described}} of it.

500|$|Criticism to {{the episode}} {{was done by}} Finley who said, [...] "So much of this show is {{dependent}} on Monk's subtle mannerisms, but he exaggerates them to an absurd degree {{as he tries to}} impress the actor who's playing him." [...] Similarly, Werts said [...] "Shalhoub pushes a tad too far with the compulsions." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today was also critical of its [...] "excessive quirks and overall credibility-busting silliness." [...] Although praised Shalhoub–Tucci dynamic, Rich Heldenfels of Akron Beacon Journal criticized it as [...] "the actor-imitating-life <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> done before on TV and in the movies, and the gag well is pretty dry." ...|$|E
500|$|Learning to be yourself, to be {{authentic}} and to act with integrity, rather than conforming to any external moral system, is arguably the fundamental motif of Williams's work, according to Sophie Grace Chappell. [...] "If there's one theme in all my work it's about authenticity and self-expression," [...] Williams said in 2002. [...] "It's the idea that some things are in some real sense really you, or express what you and others aren't... The whole <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> about spelling out the notion of inner necessity." [...] He moved moral philosophy away from the Kantian question, [...] "What is my duty?", {{and back to the}} issue that mattered to the Greeks: [...] "How should we live?" ...|$|E
500|$|After Paramount {{rejected}} the film, Roddenberry sought to produce The God Thing as a novel {{in the late}} 1970s. He signed a deal with Bantam Books to publish it, but was given extensions because of his work; first on PhaseII and then The Motion Picture. During this period, Star Trek actor Walter Koenig helped Roddenberry expand the novel. In 1991, shortly before Roddenberry's death, his assistant Susan Sackett rediscovered {{the work on the}} novel. She contacted Pocket Books, which wanted to publish it; discussions to hire Sackett and Fred Bronson to expand it to novel length were held, but negotiations stopped after Roddenberry's death and Sackett's dismissal from [...] Michael Jan Friedman was later engaged to expand the work but it went unpublished.

500|$|For {{her fourth}} album, The House (2010), Melua worked with {{producer}} William Orbit. She {{said about the}} experience: [...] "The whole <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> really exciting. It was the same feeling I had the first time I went skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but I knew all I {{had to do was}} let myself go and it was going to feel amazing. I wasn't {{trying to get away from}} anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place".|$|E
500|$|However, the Wii and PlayStation 2 {{versions}} received mostly mixed {{to negative}} reviews. IGN commented the Wii version [...] "is {{not a bad}} game" [...] but {{went on to say}} [...] "The whole <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> oversimplified and dumbed down. The Wii puzzles are a joke, the combat is almost nonexistent, and the game is pretty short." [...] GameSpot added [...] "Tomb Raider Underworld can be an enjoyable adventure, but it’s marred by bugs, camera issues, and ill-conceived Wii extras." [...] While the PlayStation 2 version was called [...] "an embarrassment to the franchise" [...] by IGN. They {{went on to say that}} the version was such a poor conversion that it shouldn't have even been released, saying [...] "Full of bugs, linear play that discourages exploration and non-existent combat, Tomb Raider Underworld feels as though it's part of the series in name and main character only." ...|$|E
500|$|Much of {{her early}} career {{is filled with}} near misses in casting, as she was up for {{significant}} roles in films such as 1997's The Postman and The Devil's Advocate and 2000's Meet the Parents, which eventually went to other actresses. In an interview in 2012, Watts said, [...] "I came to New York and auditioned {{at least five times}} for Meet the Parents. I think the director liked me but the studio didn't. I heard every piece of feedback you could imagine, and in this case, it was 'not sexy enough'." [...] Watts recalled her early career in an interview in 2002, saying, [...] "It is a tough town. I think my spirit has taken a beating. The most painful <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> the endless auditions. Knowing that you have something to offer, but not being able to show it, is so frustrating. As an unknown, you get treated badly. I auditioned and waited for things I did not have any belief in, but I needed the work and had to accept horrendous pieces of shit." [...] Watts studied the Meisner Technique.|$|E

500|$|... "I Am the Walrus" [...] was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews from critics. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review. In his review for the episode, he opined: [...] "The episode itself didn't disappoint either, as [...] this was a quality half-hour of jokes. Kaiser praised the argument between Stan and Steve, calling it a [...] "superb sequence". Concluding his review, Kaiser went on to write, [...] "Despite all the absurdity, the episode even manages to successfully come around to an emotional resolution when Stan, realizing that Steve is an utter failure at attempted mating, resolves to see Steve as a son instead of potential masculine competition. Then [...] there's a rape joke. But, it being American Dad, it's actually a surprisingly funny rape joke." [...] He went on to give the episode an [...] "A-", scoring higher than The Simpsons episode [...] "Love Is a Many Strangled Thing", but scoring lower than Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Spaghetti Western and Meatballs". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also reacted positively, writing, [...] "It was good to have American Dad back in the lineup. Roger was in fine form, and I can at least appreciate that they're {{trying to figure out}} how to make Hayley and Jeff work in the family dynamic. They never quite got there with Hayley alone, so maybe things will work better this way." [...] However, he was more critical on the sub-plot. In his review for the episode, Hughes opined: [...] "The B-story left me wanting. The writers are still trying to figure out the new dynamic of having Hayley married and Jeff living in the house with the Smiths. The whole <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> barely addressed, and this week we got a fairly weak exploration of them having fairly standard marital problems." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 23 February 2009, Chris Murphy, INXS {{creative}} director and global business strategist and former manager, {{in an interview}} with The Daily Telegraph, said J.D. was not sacked and, in fact, [...] "the band made it known to him that they had not ruled out seeing a return by Fortune." [...] He also stated JD was next on his list to call regarding a major recording contract he was negotiating for the band. In an interview with Confidential on 1 March 2009, Murphy stated [...] "The whole <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> bizarre – he was basically a contractor and his contract had ended." [...] Speaking with Billboard, Murphy stated that he would rather part ways with the band than work with Fortune. [...] "If the band said to me tomorrow, 'We'd still like you to make that call and talk to him about working on a project,' I'd have to say 'Sorry, I have to go.'" [...] However, JD Fortune toured with INXS as frontman in February 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Tom Ambrose of Empire {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} five stars. He argues that Beowulf is [...] "the finest example to date of the {{capabilities}} of this new technique [...] Previously, 3D movies were blurry, migraine-inducing affairs. Beowulf is a huge step forward [...] Although his Cockney accent initially seems incongruous [...] Winstone’s turn ultimately reveals a burgeoning humanity and poignant humility." [...] Ambrose also argues that “the creepy dead eyes <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> fixed." [...] Justin Chang of Variety argues that the screenwriters [...] "have taken some intriguing liberties with the heroic narrative [...] result is, at least, a much livelier piece of storytelling than the charmless Polar Express." [...] He also argues that [...] "Zemeckis prioritizes spectacle over human engagement, in his reliance on a medium that allows for enormous range and fluidity in its visual effects yet reduces his characters to 3-D automatons. While the technology has improved since 2004's Polar Express (particularly in the characters' more lifelike eyes), the actors still don't seem entirely there." ...|$|E
