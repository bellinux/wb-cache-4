Guessing (correctly) that all Company men beyond the river had been killed, they turned and trekked back to Bulawayo in miserable fashion, their supplies all but gone and the Matabele impeding their progress at every turn.|$|E
5|$|Becky reveals to Steve that Hooch arrested her for {{shoplifting}} {{when she}} was fifteen, and attempted to molest her. She filed a complaint against him at the time, and Hooch is determined to get his revenge as this harmed his promotion prospects. During Becky's trial, Steve develops genuine feelings for her and they begin an affair, with Steve promising to leave Michelle. Although he keeps his promise, Becky reunites with Jason, eventually leading to him proposing to her. She accepts but reconsiders when Steve proposes as well. Becky ultimately breaks up with Jason and moves in with Steve. His daughter, Amy Barlow (Amber Chadwick), initially dislikes Becky, prompting her to put their wedding on hold though Steve eventually convinces her to set a date. Becky turns up to her wedding so drunk that the vicar refuses to perform the ceremony. They plan a second ceremony, Slug returns, seemingly reformed but actually working for Hooch. Slug plants drugs on Becky. At Becky and Steve's 2nd wedding, the reception is raided by police, and Becky is arrested for drug possession. Steve hires lawyers to free Becky and after Steve and Becky find Slug and convince him to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> Hooch has on {{him that he would}} even consider framing Becky, they use it to blackmail Hooch into calling a truce and drop the charges.|$|E
5|$|Vito Spatafore is outed as {{homosexual}} {{after running}} into {{a friend at}} a New York gay night club. The rumor spreads quickly, and once word gets to Meadow that everyone else knows, she tells Tony and Carmela about the incident between Finn and Vito with the security guard. Finn then has to {{sit in front of}} Tony's entire crew and <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> happened with the guard, solidifying their thoughts on Vito's sexuality. Tony is urged {{to deal with the problem}} by Phil Leotardo, now acting boss of New York with Johnny Sack in prison. Once Vito is outed, he runs away from the city and hides out in a New Hampshire town where he claims to be writing a book and meets with the locals. Vito also starts a romantic relationship with a male cook at a local diner. Eventually, Vito returns to New Jersey and asks Tony to allow him to return to work, albeit in Atlantic City. He continues to maintain that he is not a homosexual. Tony mulls over the decision to let him work, as well as whether to let him live. When Tony fails to act, Phil intervenes and kills Spatafore. When one of the members of the New York family, Fat Dom Gamiello, pays a visit to the Jersey office and won't stop making jokes about Vito and his death, the two members of Tony's crime family who are present kill Fat Dom out of anger at the disrespect he has shown. Once more, it appears that the families are on the verge of all-out war.|$|E

25|$|On 21 March, Patton {{ordered his}} XII Corps {{to prepare for}} an assault over the Rhine on the {{following}} night, one day before Montgomery's scheduled crossing. While this was certainly short notice, it did not catch the XII Corps completely unaware. As soon as Patton had received the orders on the 19th to make a crossing, he had begun sending assault boats, bridging equipment, and other supplies forward from depots in Lorraine {{where they had been}} stockpiled since autumn in the expectation of just such an opportunity. Seeing this equipment moving up, his frontline soldiers did not need any orders from higher headquarters to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> it meant.|$|E

On August 14, Dillinger robbed a bank in Bluffton, Ohio. Tracked by police from Dayton, Ohio, he was captured and later transferred to the Allen County Jail in Lima to be indicted in connection to the Bluffton robbery. After searching him before letting him into the prison, the police discovered a document which appeared to be a prison escape plan. They demanded Dillinger <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> the document meant, but he refused.|$|E
25|$|The {{availability}} of small inexpensive computing platforms, LEDs, and compact powerful batteries allows special effects {{to be built}} into props, costumes, and scenery. Lighting, atmospherics, sounds, even motorized movement can be programmed into devices and controlled by the actors or remotely. WiFi and Bluetooth devices allow for wireless communication between the control console and the effect. For example, the LEDs built into a dress can be remotely illuminated; the console can even <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> color to emit. Costumes in Head Over Heels (a musical by Lolita Snipes), The Wiz, and The Winter's Tale are recent examples of wireless control. Lanterns, candles, fireflies, and other effects built into props and scenery also utilize embedded electronics.|$|E

The Quagmires leave their notebooks with Violet and Klaus {{so that they can}} study. Violet invents a staple-making device (using a small crab, a potato, metal rods, creamed spinach, and a fork) and makes staples while Klaus reads the notebooks out loud.|$|E
25|$|While {{work with}} cadavers had aroused some opposition, {{primarily}} from religious institutions, it was grudgingly accepted because the dead, being dead, felt no pain, and {{the indignity of}} their situations was directly related to easing {{the pain of the}} living. Animal research, on the other hand, aroused much greater passion. Animal rights groups such as the ASPCA were vehement in their protest, and while researchers such as Patrick supported animal testing because of its ability to produce reliable, applicable data, there was nonetheless a strong ethical unease about this process. Researchers at the University of Virginia have to call the cadaver's family and <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> they are using their loved one for, after getting consent from the family. This seems to lessen ethical dilemmas in contrast to animal testing, because there is no sufficient way to get consent to use an animal.|$|E

500|$|The 1997 was {{the least}} {{successful}} season ever for the Highlanders. They finished last, and managed only three wins. They spent their pre-season playing in Scotland and England where they won all seven matches. Carl Hoeft said of the pre-season; [...] "Looking back now, it's safe to say it wasn't probably the best way we could have prepared. Even now, people think were crazy when I <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> we did". They were now coached by Glenn Ross and captained by Taine Randell. Their eight defeats that season included a 7543 defeat by Natal in Durban. The points scored by Natal included 50 points by Gavin Lawlessa competition record. Their three victories that season included defeating the Canterbury Crusaders at Carisbrook, and the Waikato Chiefs at Taupowhere Doug Howlett scored three tries for the Highlanders.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{viewing the}} {{performance}} of the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Guèye decided to return to the Olympics once again. He maintained that he had a hard time explaining the sport to his fellow countrymen, saying [...] "I have to tell the people what snow is, what skis are, I have to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> big mountains are. They don't have any reference on these things." [...] Joining Guèye at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, and becoming the second Senegalese athlete to compete at a Winter Games, was ski instructor Alphonse Gomis, who resides in Tignes, near Albertville. As at the 1984 Winter Games, Guèye was Senegal's flagbearer during the Parade of Nations in the opening ceremony. No support staff were sent with the skiers, so that when Guèye injured his back, a doctor from the American team treated him.|$|E
500|$|Malouma {{announced}} in April 2014 that {{she no longer}} felt she could keep up her political fight for democracy, although she would continue to support cultural and environmental causes. Even so, her Knou lyrics included allusions to her favorite political causes: equality and rights for all, women's place in society, and education for the young, all under threat, as well as environmental protection. Referring to her political role as a senator for the opposition party Assembly of Democratic Forces, in August 2014 she commented: [...] "I use my presence and speaking time in the chamber to extend the effect of my texts and my songs. Whenever I run into ministers or important personalities, I <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> the people expect of them." [...] She has also continued to speak out about issues such as Palestine and the Iraqi War in her songs. At a press conference on December 16, 2014, Malouma announced she was leaving the opposition and joining the ruling party, the Union for the Republic, {{on the grounds that}} she could participate more effectively in building Mauritania by standing behind the policies of the current leader Aziz.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{began in}} February 2011, and {{concluded}} {{in the late}} summer (from the Northern Hemisphere's perspective). Filming largely took place in South Africa, particularly in Cape Town, but also in Durban and Springbok, Northern Cape. Outside South Africa the series was also filmed in Budapest, Hungary, and the UK. Among the separate locations the series takes place in, the New Delhi hotel in the first two episodes were shot in Cape Town, and the suburbs of Hout Bay doubled as Mozambique. Throughout the shoot the actors were allowed to perform the majority of their own stunts. Military advisors were on hand to teach the actors how to perform certain stunts, and to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> they did wrong during the take. The series includes a number of sex scenes, many of which were performed by Stapleton. In an interview with the British newspaper Metro, the actor stated [...] "I've done my fair share of nude scenes in the past {{but not as much as}} this – not as risqué, anyway," [...] adding that while he got used to it, he was always [...] "a bit nervous running around in front of 50 people with no clothes on. The sex scenes were usually with an actress I'd just met, so it's like: 'How's it going? I'm Sullivan and this is me nude.' It's nerve-racking at first but you have as much fun as you can with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Mirroring the {{deliberately}} vague detail {{within the}} novel, the blurb {{on the book}} is unusually written, in {{that it does not}} name the characters or reveal the plot. It was written by a team at Sceptre led by marketing consultant Damian Horner, and has the approval of Cleave, who described it as [...] "genius". Cleave explained: [...] "I think readers are quite smart and don't really need the whole thing spelt out for them in a plot summary. It's nice to let them discover the book at their own speed. And the technique of the book is to release these dirty secrets gradually." [...] The content of the blurb varies between UK and American editions of the novel, but both begin: [...] "We don't want to tell you too much about this book. It is a truly special story and we don't want to spoil it." [...] and end: [...] "Once you have read it, you'll want to tell everyone about it. When you do, please don't <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> happens either. The magic is in how it unfolds." [...] James Spackman, Sales and Marketing Director for Sceptre, was initially sceptical of the blurb, particularly disliking the use of [...] "we" [...] for the publisher to address the reader directly. Once the book became a best-seller, however, he revised his stance, and now believes that the reason the blurb works is because it makes a virtue of denying the reader information, with an unusual format and [...] "arrestingly direct" [...] tone. The blurb won Sceptre the [...] "Best Blurb" [...] award at the 2010 Book Marketing Society Awards.|$|E
