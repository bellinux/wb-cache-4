500|$|The {{first half}} of Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was {{recorded}} shortly {{after the completion of}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik; the second half between late 1991 and early 1992, during the album's tour. [...] "Running Away Into You" [...] is the only track recorded after he left the Chili Peppers. The album is a heavily experimental avant-garde composition whose initial purpose was spiritual and emotional expression: [...] "I wrote [...] because I was in a really big place in my head—it was a huge, spiritual place <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. As long as I'm obeying those forces, it's always going to be meaningful. I could be playing guitar and I could say 'Play something that sucks,' and if I'm in that place, it's gonna be great. And {{it has nothing to do}} with me, except in ways that can't be understood." [...] Frusciante further asserted that the album was meant to be experienced as a cohesive unit rather than separate entities or songs. Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was released on Rick Rubin's label American Recordings. Warner Bros., the Chili Peppers' label, owned rights to the album because of the leaving-artist clause in Frusciante's Chili Peppers contract. However, because he was reclusive, the label gladly handed the rights over to Rubin, who released the album at the urging of Frusciante's friends.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010 Gauci formed Tune in Tokyo, an electro-pop {{and dance}} music band, with {{producer}} Paul Brandoli. As the group's lead singer, Gauci's look and sound had changed. She told the Daily Telegraph {{that she had}} changed her style after hanging out in Melbourne's gay dance clubs with musician, and her then-husband, Hamish Cowan (Cordrazine). Gauci explained, [...] "That's where I {{came out of my}} shell. I didn't have anyone <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. Tune in Tokyo is just one part of what I want to do. We got a lot of feedback straight away, which was great because it gave me confidence about the project". On 4 November 2010 they released their debut single, [...] "Dreamer", which peaked at No.3 on the ARIA Clubs Chart. It was co-written by Brandoli and Gauci. She revealed that she was working on the group's debut album and that she had made a cameo for a 2011 film, Big Mamma's Boy, which stars actress, Holly Valance. Tune in Tokyo's second single, [...] "Ray of Love", appeared in April 2012.|$|E

6000|$|BRASSBOUND. Yes I am. Since {{you saw me}} for {{the first}} time in that garden, you've heard me say nothing clever. And I've heard you say nothing that didn't make me laugh, or make me feel friendly, as well as <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> think and what to do. That's what I mean by real cleverness. Well, I haven't got it. I can give an order when I know what order to give. I can make men obey it, willing or unwilling. But I'm stupid, I tell you: stupid. When there's no Gordon to command me, I can't think of what to do. Left to myself, I've become half a brigand. I can kick that little gutterscrub Drinkwater; but I find myself doing what he puts into my head because I can't think of {{anything}} else. When you came, I took your orders as naturally as I took Gordon's, though I little thought my next commander would be a woman. I want to take service under you. And there's no way in which that can be done except marrying you. Will you let me do it? ...|$|E
6000|$|Cree {{had been}} a grinder from his youth, having learned the trade from his father, but he gave it up when Mysy became almost blind. For a time {{he had to leave}} her in Thrums with Dan'l Wilkie's wife, and find {{employment}} himself in Tilliedrum. Mysy got me to write several letters for her to Cree, and she cried while <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> say. I never heard either of them use a term of endearment to the other, but all Mysy could tell me to put in writing was--"Oh, my son Cree; oh, my beloved son; oh, I have no one but you; oh, thou God watch over my Cree!" [...] On one of these occasions Mysy put into my hands a paper, which, she said, would perhaps help me to write the letter. It had been drawn up by Cree many years before, when he and his mother had been compelled to part for a time, and I saw from it that he had been trying to teach Mysy to write. The paper consisted of phrases such as [...] "Dear son Cree," [...] "Loving mother," [...] "I am takin' my food weel," [...] "Yesterday," [...] "Blankets," [...] "The peats is near done," [...] "Mr. Dishart," [...] "Come home, Cree." [...] The Grinder had left this paper with his mother, and she had written letters to him from it.|$|E

5000|$|Edmondson {{entered the}} world of {{sculpture}} in 1934.

I looked up in the sky and right there in the noon daylight, he hung a tombstone out for me to make. I knowed it was God <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] He began his career by working on these tombstones, which he sold or gave to friends and family in the community. Soon he began carving lawn ornaments, birdbaths, and decorative sculptures. He worked primarily with chunks of discarded limestone from demolished buildings, which were delivered to him by wrecking companies’ trucks.|$|E
