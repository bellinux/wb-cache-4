5|$|According to the story, {{unaware of}} the nature of the gift, Norton saved the cigar, keeping it on display in his college's museum. Years later, when the school was {{shutting}} its doors for good, <b>the</b> <b>alumni</b> thought it would be a fitting gesture to smoke the cigar at the college's annual reunion. The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the sober speech he was presenting, Winstead lit the cigar, and after two puffs, it exploded. A 1952 news report contradicts one detail, holding that the explosion ultimately occurred at a family reunion rather than <b>the</b> <b>alumni</b> affair noted.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{university}} opened, the State Legislature amended Cornell's charter on April 24, 1867 to specify alumni elected trustees.

(Harvard was probably the first to shift to direct election of its Board of Overseers by alumni in 1865.) Cornell's first female trustee was Martha Carey Thomas (class of 1877), who <b>the</b> <b>alumni</b> elected while she was serving as President of Bryn Mawr College.|$|E

5|$|The first {{dormitory}} {{on campus}} was Hays Hall. Wade House, Carriage House, and Whitworth House are Victorian homes housing older students. The recently constructed Chestnut Street Housing complex provides {{housing for the}} college's Greek organizations. The Presidents' Row is a cluster of ten buildings {{in the center of}} campus, several of which are dedicated to theme housing. Two sister dormitories, New Residence Hall and Bica-Ross Hall, feature suite-style living arrangements. Mellon Hall and Upperclass Hall house male freshmen. Other dormitories include Alexander Hall, Beau Hall, Marshall Hall, North Hall, and Penn House.

Grant Miller Library is the modern library; its predecessor, Thompson Hall, is now used for administrative purposes. The Hub, The Commons, and the Rossin Campus Center provide recreational and dining facilities for students. The athletic and intramural teams utilize Cameron Stadium for football and track. The Henry Memorial Center is used for basketball, wrestling, swimming, and volleyball. Other athletic facilities include Brooks Park, Ross Memorial Park and Alexandre Stadium, and the Janet L. Swanson Tennis Courts.|$|E
5|$|The {{high school}} was the first new high school {{to be built in}} Saint Paul or Minneapolis since the 1970s. The school {{district}} was also not expecting to build another high school for 40 years after. As a result, the competition to name the school was fierce. The name Arlington High School was eventually chosen from a list of 85 suggestions. Two names, Arlington and Mechanic Arts, were quickly favored. Mechanic Arts was the initial favorite after alumni of the former school campaigned for the name to be reused after the first Mechanic Arts High School was closed down in 1976 after operating for 86 years. <b>The</b> <b>alumni</b> created a lobbying group and even enlisted the help of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, a 1925 graduate of Mechanic Arts. However, the school board's policy of naming schools after local neighborhoods and street names eventually won out with the name Arlington being chosen in a 5-2 vote. The chosen school colors, blue and white, were the colors of Mechanic Arts.|$|E
5|$|There are ten wars {{involving}} the United States {{for which the}} Medal of Honor has been bestowed upon a USMA alumnus.

Four alumni were recognized for their contributions to the Spanish–American War, nine for the Philippine–American War, two for the Boxer Rebellion, and one for the Banana Wars.
