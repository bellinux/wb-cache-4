I wish it didn't, but it does. We left it hanging. And there's a way to finish this story that i think would be satisfying to me and the many fans." [...] She also stated regarding the hybrid character that [...] "Had we done a fifth one, I don't doubt that her humanity would have prevailed. I do feel like there is more story to tell. I feel a longing from fans for the story to be finished. I could imagine a situation where we finish telling the story." [...] She was quoted: [...] "I don't think Alien belongs on Earth popping out of a haystack, which is where I was afraid it was going to go. I feel it should take place in {{the far reaches of the}} universe where no one in their right mind would go. There are very few filmmakers <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of that I would want to entrust this to." ...|$|E

The eldest, Elizabeth, died in 1927 of septicaemia {{at the age of}} four. When talking of his childhood he said he [...] "adored it in all its aspects. If anyone should be grateful for their upbringing, for their mam and dad, I'm that person. I was the kid who came from a little part of paradise." [...] On his upbringing in Middlesbrough, Clough claimed that it was not the most well-appointed place in the world, [...] "But to me it was heaven". [...] "Everything I have done, everything I've achieved, everything <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of that has directed and affected my life – apart from the drink – stemmed from my childhood. Maybe it was the constant sight of Mam, with eight children to look after, working from morning until night, working harder than you or I have ever worked." ...|$|E

2500|$|A song titled [...] "Skyscraper" [...] {{was written}} by Toby Gad, Lindy Robbins, and Kerli for Utopia however the song {{did not make it}} to her album and instead Kerli gave it to be {{recorded}} by American musician Demi Lovato for her album Unbroken. Kerli was very pleased by Lovato's recording and responded by saying [...] "I really think that artists are story tellers and are here to deliver a message and there's no better person <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of right now than her to deliver that very story. So although I did write this song for my album, it's really her song. She nails it, she owns it. I am just the Santa's little helper here." [...] Gad, Robbins, and Kerli also penned a song titled [...] "I Feel Immortal" [...] for Kerli that also did not make it to her album. The song was eventually recorded by Finnish musician Tarja for her album What Lies Beneath. A version of the track titled [...] "Immortal" [...] recorded by Kerli appears on Frankenweenie Unleashed!, an album consisting of tracks from and inspired by the Tim Burton film Frankenweenie.|$|E
2500|$|Sullivan, like Marshall Kirk, Hunter Madsen, and Bruce Bawer, {{has been}} {{described}} by Urvashi Vaid as a proponent of [...] "legitimation", seeing the objective of the gay rights movement as being [...] "mainstreaming gay and lesbian people" [...] rather than [...] "radical social change". Sullivan wrote the first major article in the United States advocating for gay people to be given the right to marry, published in The New Republic in 1989. Many gay rights organisations attacked him for the stance at the time. Many on [...] "the gay left" [...] believed that he was promoting [...] "assimilation" [...] into [...] "straight culture", when the aim of most at that time was to alter codes of sexuality and society as a whole, rather than fitting gays into it. However, his arguments eventually became widely accepted and formed the basis of the modern movement to allow same-sex marriage. In the wake of the United States Supreme Court rulings on same-sex marriage in 2013 (Hollingsworth v. Perry and United States v. Windsor), New York Times op-ed columnist Ross Douthat suggested that Sullivan might be the most influential political writer of his generation, writing, [...] "No intellectual <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of, writing on a fraught and controversial topic, has seen their once-crankish, outlandish-seeming idea become the conventional wisdom so quickly, and be instantantiated so rapidly in law and custom." ...|$|E
2500|$|VA-11 HALL-A [...] made {{appearances}} on {{lists of the}} most anticipated video games multiple times before its release. An article by GamesRadar staff of the [...] "12 PAX East games we wish we were still playing" [...] included VA-11 HALL-A; praise was directed at the game's complexity, and how [...] "you can decide to give the customer the drink they ordered, flipping through the recipe book and dragging ingredients into the mixer in a simple minigame, or you can screw it up, and give them something totally different", {{as well as the}} [...] "wildly different directions" [...] the narrative takes as a result. Similarly, Twinfinite's Matthew Byrd ranked VA-11 HALL-A first on the [...] "10 Anticipated Indie Games You Have to Check Out in 2016", writing that: [...] "While I can honestly say that I've never specifically wished for a cyberpunk bartending game before, now that I know such a thing exists, it is all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of." [...] Zach Budgor of Kill Screen described VA-11 HALL-A as one of their favourite titles at Cyberpunk Game Jam 2014, describing it as [...] "self-styled 'cyberpunk bartender action' with detailed art and an LP's worth of bass-heavy future bangers." [...] PC Gamer added VA-11 HALL-As playable prologue to their list of [...] "The best free PC games". Upon release, Thomas Faust of IndieGames.com labelled VA-11 HALL-A the best game of the year, adding [...] "as far as I'm concerned, the rest of 2016 can go home now. Game of the year right there, bam." [...] Faust also noted that the slice of life setting of VA-11 HALL-A, as well as its characters, are a departure from more conventional video game settings. Similarly, Gizmodo UK on June 25 listed VA-11 HALL-A as their top recommended video game for the week. Ana Valens of Den of Geek also listed VA-11 HALL-A as [...] "one of the great visual novels of 2016", again praising the game's characters and [...] "powerful" [...] writing.|$|E

When one looks at these (portraits), one realizes that they are in fact the key to Kulenovic's work considered as a whole. The still lifes, the architectural compositions, and the landscapes are also, in their essence, attempts to identify and present a particular state of being.
