5|$|In 1907, to {{mark the}} seventh centenary {{of the birth of}} King James I, Gaudí {{designed}} a monument in his memory. It would have been situated in the Plaça del Rei, and would have also meant the renovation of the adjacent buildings: new roof for the cathedral, as well as the completion of its towers and cupola; placement of three vases above the buttresses of the Chapel of Santa Àgada, dedicated to <b>the</b> <b>Litany</b> <b>of</b> the Blessed Virgin Mary, as well as the figure of an angel on top of the chapel's tower; finally, the opening of a large square next to the walls (now the Plaça Ramon Berenguer el Grand).

40|$|This {{bachelor}} work "Litany" {{deals with}} the origin of liturgical processions called <b>litanies</b> and with <b>the</b> <b>litany</b> {{as a form of}} prayer. These two meanings are tightly connected as <b>the</b> singing <b>of</b> <b>litanies</b> was an inseparable part of the processions. The origin of the processions just as <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>litany</b> prayer form {{can be traced back to}} Byzantium, their use in the western Church has developed and been adapted to the western Christianity. The first part deals with <b>the</b> basic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>litany</b> and invocation Kyrie eleison and is followed by a chapter about titulars and stationary service in Rome. The next chapters focus on litanies as a part of liturgy, with a special attention to <b>the</b> <b>Litanies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saints. The text pursues the history of this prayer form and compares some of them. In the concluding part it tries to outline <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>litany</b> in <b>the</b> future.

500|$|The Selva morale e spirituale of 1641, and the posthumous Messa et salmi {{published}} in 1650 (which was edited by Cavalli), are selections {{of the sacred}} music that Monteverdi wrote for San Marco during his 30-year tenure – much else was likely written but not published. The Selva morale volume opens {{with a series of}} madrigal settings on moral texts, dwelling on themes such as [...] "the transitory nature of love, earthly rank and achievement, even existence itself". They are followed by a Mass in conservative style (stile antico), the high point of which is an extended seven-voice [...] "Gloria". Scholars believe that this might have been written to celebrate the end of the 1631 plague. The rest of the volume is made up of numerous psalm settings, two Magnificats and three Salve Reginas. The Messa et salmi volume includes a stile antico Mass for four voices, a polyphonic setting of the psalm Laetatus Sum, and a version of <b>the</b> <b>Litany</b> <b>of</b> Lareto that Monteverdi had originally {{published in}} 1620.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Litany</b> <b>of</b> the Holy Name is [...] a Roman Catholic Prayer, {{probably}} of the 15th century (Bernardino of Siena and John of Capistrano). The Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus {{was introduced}} in 1530.|$|E
2500|$|At the Vigil of Pentecost, the {{traditional}} blessing of baptismal water, accompanied by <b>the</b> <b>Litany</b> <b>of</b> the Saints and six Old Testament readings, was omitted completely. These were still {{printed in the}} Missal, which, except for {{the replacement of the}} Holy Week liturgies, remained unchanged and was not considered to constitute a new editio typica superseding that of Pope Pius X, which was published by Pope Benedict XV in 1920.|$|E
5000|$|Before going further, {{it may be}} well to say a {{few words}} on <b>the</b> {{composition}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>litanies</b> we have been considering. With regard to their content, which consists mainly of praises of the Blessed Virgin, it would seem to have been taken not so much from the Scriptures and the Fathers, at least directly, as from popular medieval Latin poetry. To be convinced of this, it suffices to glance through the Daniel and Mone collections, and especially through the [...] "Analectica Hymnica medii ævi" [...] of DrevesBlume. In the earlier and longer litanies whole rhythmic strophes are to be found, taken bodily from such poetry, and employed as praises of the Blessed Virgin. With regard to their form, it is certain that those who first composed <b>the</b> Marian <b>litanies</b> aimed at imitating <b>the</b> <b>litanies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saints which had been in use in the Church since the 8th century. During the Middle Ages, as is well known, it was customary to repeat over and over single invocations in <b>the</b> <b>litanies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saints, and thus we find that the basic principle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marian <b>litanies</b> is this constant repetition of the invocation, [...] "Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis." [...] And in order that this repetition might not prove monotonous in the Middle Ages recourse was had to an expedient since then universally used, not only in private devotions but even in liturgical prayer, that of amplifying by means of what are called tropes or farcituræ. They had a model in the Kyrie of the Mass, e.g. [...] "Kyrie, fons bonitatis, pater ingenite, a quo bona cuncta procedunt, eleison." [...] It was an easy matter to improvise between the [...] "Sancta Maria" [...] and the [...] "Ora pro nobis", repeated over and over, a series of tropes consisting of different praises, with an occasional added petition, imitated however broadly from <b>the</b> <b>litanies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saints. Thus <b>the</b> Marian <b>litany</b> was evolved.|$|R
25|$|After {{moving to}} Europe, Galas made her solo {{performance}} debut at the Festival d'Avignon, in France, in 1973, performing {{the lead in}} the opera Un Jour comme un autre, by composer Vinko Globokar, based upon Amnesty International's documentation of the arrest and torture of a Turkish woman for alleged treason. Her first album was <b>The</b> <b>Litanies</b> <b>of</b> Satan, released in 1982. Her second album, Diamanda Galas, was released in 1984.|$|R
5000|$|In 1875, the [...] "Fabrique" [...] (official {{organization}} of parishioners) and direct gifts from parishioners {{made it possible}} to start restoration work, and the sculptures representing various motifs taken from Christian symbolism date from that time. The most typical features are the 82 medallions which decorate the various sides of the building, representing the history of Christianity, the sins <b>of</b> men, redemption, <b>the</b> <b>litanies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin Mary and the symbols of the Church.|$|R
2500|$|Throughout 1937 {{progress}} was made in promoting the Divine Mercy and in November 1937 a pamphlet was published with the title Christ, King of Mercy.

On 10 November 1937, Mother Irene, Faustina's superior, showed her the booklets while Faustina rested in her bed.|$|E
2500|$|Eight years earlier, in 1846, the Pope had {{granted the}} {{unanimous}} wish {{of the bishops}} from the United States, and declared the Immaculata the patron of the USA. [...] During the First Vatican Council, some 108 council fathers requested adding the words [...] "Immaculate Virgin" [...] to the [...] "Hail Mary" [...] prayer and to add the Immaculata to <b>the</b> <b>Litany</b> <b>of</b> Loreto. Some fathers requested the dogma of the Immaculate Conception {{to be included in}} the Creed of the Church.|$|E
2500|$|Changes {{begun by}} Sweeney were {{completed}} under Joseph Anthony Ferrario, third Bishop of Honolulu. Ferrario also inaugurated the beginning phases of ambitious restoration work. [...] His cathedral rectors, Monsignor Terrence A. M. Watanabe {{and his successor}} Nathan Mamo, were responsible for sending the clerestory statues of saints perched over the nave of the church back to France where they were professionally preserved. When the statues returned, they were installed above the nave of the church but in a new, more logical order of placement in accordance with <b>the</b> <b>Litany</b> <b>of</b> the Saints.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the second}} half of the 15th century we meet another type <b>of</b> <b>litany</b> which was to be {{publicly}} chanted tempore pestis sive epydimic. The invocations are very simple and all begin, not with the words [...] "Sancta Maria", but with [...] "Sancta mater", e.g.: Sancta mater Creatoris; Sancta mater Salvatoris; Sancta mater munditie; Sancta mater auxilii; Sancta mater consolationis; Sancta mater intemerata; Sancta mater inviolata; Sancta mater virginum, etc. At the end, however, are a few short petitions such as those found in <b>the</b> <b>litanies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saints.|$|R
50|$|The cult of St. Odile spread rapidly, {{and spread}} outside France to Germany. She was {{mentioned}} in <b>the</b> <b>litanies</b> <b>of</b> Freising, Utrecht and Ratisbon {{at least from}} the 9th century. Amongst the common people, pilgrimages to her shrine were popular, and were by no means limited to the masses; from Charlemagne onwards, emperors also conducted pilgrimages in her honour. Indeed, Charlemagne granted immunity to the convent at Hohenberg, which was later officially ratified by Louis the Pious on 9 March 837.|$|R
