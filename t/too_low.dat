5|$|It is {{now clear}} that the common {{ancestor}} of the bony fishes (Osteichthyes) had a primitive air-breathing lung—later evolved into a swim bladder in most actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes). This suggests that crossopterygians evolved in warm shallow waters, using their simple lung when the oxygen level in the water became <b>too</b> <b>low.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{maintain}} dynamic equilibrium {{and effectively}} carry out certain functions, a system must detect {{and respond to}} perturbations. After the detection of a perturbation, a biological system normally responds through negative feedback that stabilize conditions by reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system. One example is the release of glucagon when sugar levels are <b>too</b> <b>low.</b>|$|E
5|$|All Stuka {{units were}} moved to Germany's eastern border in {{preparation}} for the invasion of Poland. On the morning of 15 August 1939, during a mass-formation dive-bombing demonstration for high-ranking commanders of the Luftwaffe at Neuhammer training grounds near Sagan, 13 Ju 87s and 26 crew members were lost when they crashed into the ground almost simultaneously. The planes dived through cloud, expecting to release their practice bombs and pull out of the dive once below the cloud ceiling, unaware that on that particular day the ceiling was <b>too</b> <b>low</b> and unexpected ground mist formed, leaving them no time {{to pull out of the}} dive.|$|E
50|$|The masking sound {{should be}} truly {{background}} {{so it does}} not call attention to itself. the masking spectrum should be random and neutral, not <b>too</b> much <b>low</b> or high frequency sound.

5|$|All of the aircrew {{involved}} in the crash had only limited flying time {{in the months before}} the crash. The B-52's aircrew were apparently unaware that the aircraft had stalled until shortly before impact, indicated by a failure to apply standard recovery techniques to the aircraft once it entered the stall. The investigation reported that, even if the proper stall recovery techniques had been applied, the aircraft was likely <b>too</b> <b>low</b> to recover before hitting the ground.|$|E
5|$|All species {{experienced}} over-hunting by sealers. The Hawaiian {{monk seal}} experienced population drops in the 19th century and during World War II, and the Caribbean monk seal was exploited since the 1500s until the 1850s, when populations were <b>too</b> <b>low</b> to hunt commercially. The Mediterranean monk seal has experienced commercial hunting since the Middle Ages and eradication by fishermen. Monk seals {{have developed a}} fear of humans, and may even abandon beaches due to human presence. There are currently around 1,700 monk seals in total.|$|E
5|$|Caddisfly {{cases are}} open at both ends, the larvae drawing oxygenated water through the {{posterior}} end, over their gills, and pumping {{it out of}} the wider, anterior end. The larvae move around inside the tubes and this helps maintain the water current; the lower the oxygen content of the water, the more active the larvae need to be. This mechanism enable caddisfly larvae to live in waters <b>too</b> <b>low</b> in oxygen content to support stonefly and mayfly larvae.|$|E
60|$|From Point Vancouver {{the river}} turned towards the northeast, and became more {{contracted}} and rapid, with occasional islands and frequent sand-banks. These islands are furnished {{with a number}} of ponds, and at certain seasons abound with swans, geese, brandts, cranes, gulls, plover, and other wild-fowl. The shores, <b>too,</b> are <b>low</b> and closely wooded, with such an undergrowth of vines and rushes as to be almost impassable.|$|R
50|$|However, {{because the}} fare {{for all these}} classes is the same they should be aggregated. EMSRa will {{calculate}} protection limits that are too conservative. In other words, it will reserve too many seats for the higher fares, thereby rejecting <b>too</b> many <b>low</b> fare bookings. Although having equal fares is not realistic this will also happen if the difference between fares is small. Therefore EMSRb was invented.|$|R
50|$|Other circulatory {{adjustments}} include {{reducing their}} heart rate, and blood buffering, which prevents the pH {{of the blood}} from decreasing <b>too</b> much. <b>Low</b> pH in the blood sends {{a signal to the}} brain that it needs oxygen before it actually needs oxygen. This can be observed after holding one's breath for a long time, and then exhaling, relieving the need to breathe for a few more seconds.|$|R
5|$|In September 1998 Manchester United {{were the}} target of a {{proposed}} takeover by British Sky Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Negotiations between both sides had begun during the summer, but had stalled after disagreements over the asking price. The satellite group’s original bid of £575million – initially thought to be their final offer – was deemed <b>too</b> <b>low</b> by two members of United’s board (chairman Martin Edwards and Professor Sir Roland Smith), who pressed for a higher figure. Two days of talks followed and in an attempt to close the deal, BSkyB made a final bid of £623.4million.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to carbon fiber, glass can undergo more elongation before it breaks. Thinner filaments can bend further before they break. The viscosity of the molten glass {{is very important}} for manufacturing success. During drawing, the process where the hot glass is pulled to reduce the diameter of the fiber, the viscosity must be relatively low. If it is too high, the fiber will break during drawing. However, if it is <b>too</b> <b>low,</b> the glass will form droplets instead of being drawn out into a fiber.|$|E
5|$|John Playfair {{carried out}} a second survey of Schiehallion in 1811; {{on the basis of}} a rethink of its rock strata, he {{suggested}} a density of 4,560 to , though the then elderly Hutton vigorously defended the original value in an 1821 paper to the Society. Playfair's calculations had raised the density closer towards its modern value, but was still <b>too</b> <b>low</b> and significantly poorer than Cavendish's computation of some years earlier.|$|E
50|$|The {{elements}} {{that make up}} biological molecules (C, H, N, O, P, S) are <b>too</b> light (<b>low</b> atomic number, Z) to be clearly visualized as individual atoms by transmission electron microscopy. To circumvent this problem, the DNA bases can be labeled with heavier atoms (higher Z). Each nucleotide is tagged with a characteristic heavy label, {{so that they can}} be distinguished in the transmission electron micrograph.|$|R

5|$|Kowloon Walled City's early {{population}} fluctuated between {{zero and}} a few hundred, and began growing steadily shortly after World War II. However, there is no accurate population information available {{for much of the}} Walled City's later existence. Official census numbers estimated the Walled City's population at 10,004 in 1971 and 14,617 in 1981, but these figures were commonly considered to be much <b>too</b> <b>low.</b> Informal estimates, on the other hand, often mistakenly included the neighbouring squatter village of Sai Tau Tsuen. Population figures of about 50,000 were also reported.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Hadl {{learned that}} Tiger Electronics had {{licensed}} King Kong for a handheld game. He decided that Universal's earnings from it were <b>too</b> <b>low</b> {{and that the}} license's granting of exclusive rights to Tiger would impede the agreement with Coleco. On May 4, Sheinberg sent Tiger a mailgram demanding that they send their game in for further approval. Universal reviewed it and decided that King Kong was too similar to Donkey Kong. On May 8, Steinberg revoked Tiger's license, but Tiger president O. R. Rissman refused to give in and challenged Universal's claim that it owned the King Kong name.|$|E
5|$|Muscarine, {{discovered}} in 1869, was long {{thought to be}} the active hallucinogenic agent in A.muscaria. Muscarine binds with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors leading to the excitation of neurons bearing these receptors. The levels of muscarine in Amanita muscaria are minute when compared with other poisonous fungi such as Inocybe erubescens, the small white Clitocybe species C. dealbata and C. rivulosa.

50|$|By the 1920s it {{was clear}} that the old tunnel was <b>too</b> narrow, <b>low</b> and steep (with a {{gradient}} of 1 in 80) to accommodate the emerging specification of rolling stock. So a new, wider tunnel was constructed adjacent to the old one. The build was completed between 1924 and 1926, much faster than the first tunnel due to the advance in tunnelling tools and techniques. It was opened on 2 August 1926, and remains in use today.|$|R
