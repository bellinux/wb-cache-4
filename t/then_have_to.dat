5|$|Meanwhile, Leonard, Raj, and Howard {{attempt to}} solve their Comic-Con problem by {{illegally}} buying scalped tickets. After arranging for a scalper to come to Leonard's apartment, they begin to get worried, remembering Sheldon's warning {{that they could get}} charged for petty theft, <b>then</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> disclose the crime in the future. When the scalper is heard arriving, they quickly turn off the lights and stay silent.|$|E
5|$|The reason I haven't {{spoken to}} you before now is this: You deserve the truth. And as {{frustrating}} as the waiting has been, I felt it was improper {{to come to you}} with sketchy reports, or possibly even erroneous statements, which would <b>then</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be corrected, creating even more doubt and confusion. There's been enough of that.|$|E
5|$|The {{use of a}} wing-forward was a {{distinctive}} feature of New Zealand play. Instead of having eight men in the scrum as was normal elsewhere, seven men were usedthe missing man, the wing-forward, instead fed {{the ball into the}} scrum then held onto one of their hookers while the ball progressed through the scrum to their half-back. With the wing-forward bound {{to the side of the}} scrum, the opposing half-back would <b>then</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> manoeuvre past him to tackle the player with the ball. This increased the amount of time the half-back would have in possession of the ball before his opposite could tackle him.|$|E
50|$|At Copacabana Beach, {{teams would}} vote for the U-Turn. They <b>then</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> look for a sand {{sculpture}} of sunbathers with an arrow pointing them towards their next clue. Teams <b>then</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> perform 30 minutes of Brazilian aerobics designed to tone their buttocks.|$|R
50|$|Once {{teams had}} arrived at the Sino-Russian Culture and Arts Exhibition Hall they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> choose one of the ten {{provided}} matryoshka dolls. They <b>then</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> search the rooms, to find a set of dolls missing their exact doll. Once found they <b>then</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> present their set to the curator to receive their next clue.|$|R

5|$|Since 2008, the zoo {{has been}} {{lobbying}} for {{a permit to}} build an eagle sanctuary {{in order to be}} able to distribute the animals' feathers to tribal members for ceremonial purposes in accordance with federal law. Since the species are listed as endangered, any remains of dead animals are confiscated by the federal government and transported to a central repository in Colorado; members of Native American Indian nations <b>then</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> apply individually to receive parts, such as feathers, in a lengthy process with wait-times that can exceed several years. Since a tribally operated eagle sanctuary constitutes an exception to the process, it would be instrumental in strengthening Navajo cultural sovereignty; currently, only the Iowa and Zuni nations operate eagle sanctuaries for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|The third British {{airborne}} mission planned was Operation Fustian, to {{be carried}} out by the 1st Parachute Brigade, under Brigadier Gerald Lathbury, and scheduled for the night of 13–14 July. The 1st Parachute Brigade's objective was the Primosole bridge, crossing the Simeto River, south of Catania. The bridge was a vital objective, as it was the only crossing point over the Simeto. Its capture would give the Eighth Army access to the Catania plain, to enable them to continue their advance northwards; its destruction would seriously hamper the advance. Once the parachute brigade had captured the bridge, they would <b>then</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> defend it until relieved by units of the Eighth Army advancing from the landing beaches.|$|E
5|$|To {{initiate}} {{firing the}} weapon the trigger mechanism, which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the firing pin to the butt; the user would <b>then</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> bend over and pull {{the body of the}} weapon upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to the trigger and cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it {{to the rest of the}} weapon, and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon; it was also difficult to do when lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using the weapon in action.|$|E

50|$|In this Leg's Detour, teams chose {{between two}} {{mountain}} rescue tasks: Search and Rescue. In Search, teams used {{a set of}} avalanche beacons to search the Matterhorn for a dummy buried in the snow; they <b>then</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> dig out the whole dummy before they could receive their next clue. In Rescue, teams used a special hoisting device to rescue a mountaineer trapped in a crevasse. One team member <b>had</b> <b>to</b> lower his or her teammate into the crevasse; the lowered teammate <b>then</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> attach a carabiner to the mountaineer. The teammate at the top <b>then</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> raise the pair back to the surface; once at the top, the rescued mountaineer would give them their next clue.|$|R
5|$|Wilson's small {{majority}} {{after the}} 1964 general election {{had made the}} transaction of government business difficult, and in 1966 he called another election in which Labour gained a strong working majority of 96. Some older members of Heath's team, including Lloyd, retired from the front bench, making room {{for members of the}} next generation. Heath moved Maudling to the foreign affairs portfolio, and Douglas-Home took over Lloyd's responsibilities as spokesman on Commonwealth relations. Heath was widely seen as ineffective against Wilson, and as the 1970 general election approached there was concern within the party that he would lose, and that Powell would seek to replace him as leader. Maudling and the chief whip, William Whitelaw, believed that if Heath had to resign Douglas-Home would be the safest candidate to keep Powell out. Douglas-Home shared their view that Labour would win the 1970 election, and that Heath might <b>then</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> resign, but he declined to commit himself. To the surprise of almost everyone except Heath, the Conservatives won the election, with a majority of 31 seats.|$|E
25|$|Thirdly, {{there are}} {{specific}} domains. After choosing {{the type of}} park to visit e.g. waterpark, you <b>then</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain, {{there are many different}} types (e.g. free verse, riddles, sonnet, etc.) that have to be selected from.|$|E
25|$|A {{more time}} {{consuming}} way to evaluate REG algorithms is by letting humans judge the Adequacy (How clear is the description?) and Fluency (Is the description given in good and clear English?) of the generated expression. Also Belz and Gatt evaluated referring expressions using an experimental setup. The participants get a generated description and <b>then</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{click on the}} target. Here the extrinsic metrics reading time, identification time and error rate could be evaluated.|$|E

25|$|Producing {{a lot of}} tritium in {{this way}} would require {{reactors}} with very high neutron fluxes, or with a very high proportion of heavy water to nuclear fuel and very low neutron absorption by other reactor material. The tritium would <b>then</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be recovered by isotope separation from a much larger quantity of deuterium, unlike production from lithium-6 (the present method), where only chemical separation is needed.|$|E
25|$|Registration makes new doctors legally able to {{practice}} medicine without supervision. They will <b>then</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> choose between various career paths, each usually requiring a specific admission exam: most either choose to train as general practitioner (a 3-year course run by each Region, including both general practice and rotation at non-university hospitals), or {{to enter a}} Scuola di Specializzazione ("specialty school") at a university hospital 5-year or 6-year course.|$|E
25|$|In Gaelic law, a 'sanctuary' {{called a}} maighin digona {{surrounded}} each person's dwelling. The maighin digona's size varied {{according to the}} owner's rank. In {{the case of a}} bóaire it stretched as far as he, while sitting at his house, could cast a cnairsech (variously described as a spear or sledgehammer). The owner of a maighin digona could offer its protection to someone fleeing from pursuers, who would <b>then</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> bring that person to justice by lawful means.|$|E

25|$|Things {{would not}} get easier for United, as they would <b>then</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> travel to Los Angeles {{to take on the}} MLS-league leaders. Thanks to Andy Najar's 60th-minute opener, it seemed as if United would {{accomplish}} perhaps the greatest upset during the MLS season. It would fail to be the case thanks to two quick goals from Galaxy captain, Landon Donovan, who netted a pair of goals in the 81st and 86th minute; giving LA the 2–1 victory over the Black-and-Red.|$|E
25|$|Once the new {{government}} was installed in May–June 2011, an expert mission from UNREC (Lomé) came to the Comoros and produced guidelines for the elaboration of a national security policy, which were discussed by different actors, notably the national defence authorities and civil society. By {{the end of the}} programme in end March 2012, a normative framework agreed upon by all entities involved in SSR will have been established. This will <b>then</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be adopted by Parliament and implemented by the authorities.|$|E
25|$|When the Inner Circle line first opened, {{services}} {{originated from}} Spencer Street {{station at the}} western end of the Melbourne central business district. Trains bound for the then terminus at Heidelberg station (now on the Hurstbridge line) would run to North Fitzroy station, then continue south to Victoria Park station (then known as Collingwood, and now on the Hurstbridge and South Morang lines). Locomotives would <b>then</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> change ends and the trains return to Clifton Hill station, where they diverged east on to the line to Heidelberg.|$|E

25|$|The {{first route}} to be {{introduced}} in 1955 was the 12A from St Marychurch through Babbacombe, Torquay, Paignton and Goodrington to Broadsands. To reach Paignton's sea front at Preston the bus had to pass under a very low railway bridge. A licence for the route was only granted on condition that buses would {{come to a stop}} before passing under the bridge, the conductor would <b>then</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> instruct passengers on the top deck to remain in their seats and then stand {{at the top of the}} stairs to see that they did.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have tried to}} reverse the order of her husbands, but find difficulty if they delay Marcella's first marriage (as alleged) until 15 BC when she was 25. If so, she would be very old for a first marriage, and <b>then</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> remarry and immediately have two children before her second husband died in office in 12 BC. Instead, marriage 10 years earlier seems much more likely, given that Marcella's two younger half-sisters had already married by 15, and the younger Antonia gave birth to Germanicus on 24 May 15 BC.|$|E
25|$|After graduating, new doctors must {{complete}} a three-month, unpaid, supervised tirocinio post-lauream ("post-degree placement") {{consisting of two}} months in their university hospital (one month in a medical service and one in a surgical service) {{as well as one}} month shadowing a general practitioner. After getting a statement of successful completion of each month from their supervisors, new doctors take the esame di stato ("state exame") to obtain full license to practise medicine. They will <b>then</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> register with one of the branches of the Ordine dei Medici ("Order of Physicians"), which are based in each of the Provinces of Italy.|$|E
