5|$|In a {{flashback}} to 1990, Bart {{goes to his}} first day of school, but <b>things</b> <b>do</b> not go so well for him and he becomes depressed. It is during discussions of Bart's future that the school psychologist realizes the young Lisa is very intelligent, telling Homer and Marge {{that they need to}} nurture her gifted spirit. They try to send Lisa to a private school but the tuition fee costs $6,000. Meanwhile, a terrible heatwave hits Springfield and Homer saves $200 to buy an air conditioner. Marge, however, asks Homer not to buy one until they figure out how to help Lisa. At the school, Bart talks with Milhouse and makes a farting sound, which Milhouse finds amusing. Encouraged, Bart entertains a group of children and sets out on his path to become the school prankster.|$|E

25|$|The Koine Greek terms {{used in the}} New Testament of the {{structure}} on which Jesus died are stauros (σταυρός) and xylon (ξύλον). Those words, which can refer to many different <b>things,</b> <b>do</b> not indicate the precise shape of {{the structure}}.

They have known too that the words had that meaning also, and so have not considered necessarily incorrect the traditional picture of a cross with transom.|$|E

25|$|The Hangover Part II is a 2011 American comedy film {{produced}} by Legendary Pictures and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. It is {{the sequel to}} the 2009 film The Hangover and the second installment in The Hangover trilogy. Directed by Todd Phillips, who co-wrote the script with Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong, the film stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Ken Jeong, Jeffrey Tambor, Justin Bartha, and Paul Giamatti. It {{tells the story of}} Phil, Stu, Alan, and Doug as they travel to Thailand for Stu's wedding. After the bachelor party in Las Vegas, Stu takes no chances and opts for a safe, subdued pre-wedding brunch. <b>Things</b> <b>do</b> not go as planned, resulting in another bad hangover with no memories of the previous night.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{perceived}} differences between technical {{and other forms of}} recreational diving is the associated hazards, of which there are more associated with technical diving, and risk, which is often, but not always greater in technical diving. Hazards are the circumstances that may cause harm, and risk is the likelihood of the harm actually occurring. The hazards are partly due to the extended scope of technical diving, and partly associated with the equipment used. In some cases the equipment used presents a secondary risk while mitigating a primary risk, such as the complexity of gas management needed {{to reduce the risk of}} a fatal gas supply failure, or the use of gases potentially unbreathable for some parts of a dive profile to reduce the risk of harm caused by oxygen toxicity, nitrogen narcosis or decompression sickness for the whole operation. Reduction of secondary risks may also affect equipment choice, but is largely skill-based. Training of technical divers includes procedures which are known from experience to be effective in handling the most common contingencies. Divers proficient in these emergency drills are less likely to be overwhelmed by the circumstances when <b>things</b> <b>do</b> not go according to plan, and are less likely to panic.|$|E
25|$|Josie {{initially}} gets {{herself a}} job as a barmaid at The Queen Victoria public house and she later becomes the receptionist at Fred Fonseca (Jimi Mistry)'s surgery. However, <b>things</b> <b>do</b> not run smoothly for her in her new post. Josie is a strict perfectionist, she also expects perfection from everyone else and she isn't adverse to telling them so either. Her strict mannerisms only seek to frighten away half the patients. She eventually manages to settle down with a lot of coaching from Dr Fonseca, however, yet more problems arise when she discovers that her employer is homosexual. Josie is a strict Christian and she feels that working for a homosexual conflicts with her religious beliefs. She goes as far as to accuse him of coercing Kim into becoming a lesbian. She continues down a path of self-righteousness, judging everyone by her own, impossibly high standards. After she discovers that her son has become involved with ex-prostitute, Nina Harris (Troy Titus Adams), she cannot condone their friendship and her aloof manner towards Nina infuriates Mick. It takes bigoted remarks by racist Jim Branning (John Bardon) to make Josie realise that she is as prejudiced in her own way as he is, but by then it is too late. Having forgotten to renew her visa, she is threatened with deportation and is forced to return to Jamaica, leaving Kim in Mick's care. She promises Kim she will return when she sorts out her visa. Her last appearance is in February 2000.|$|E

Many Springfield residents enter the contest, but <b>things</b> <b>do</b> not go well {{when one of the}} judges, Rainier Wolfcastle, declares himself the winner for [...] "being seen with you freaks". The contest ends in a riot and Lisa ends up hit in the face twice with pudding. She denounces Springfield for its anti-intellectualism in an open letter that ends up in the newspaper, which no one reads. This impresses the Springfield Mensa chapter, which accepts her for membership after Principal Skinner shared her placement tests and she brought them a pie for their latest meeting.|$|E
500|$|There is no supplication in Christian Science prayer. The process {{involves}} the Scientist {{engaging in a}} silent argument to affirm to herself the unreality of matter, something Christian Science practitioners will do for a fee, including in absentia, to address ill health or other problems. Wilson writes that Christian Science healing is [...] "not curative... on its own premises, but rather preventative of ill health, accident and misfortune, since it claims {{to lead to a}} state of consciousness where these <b>things</b> <b>do</b> not exist. What heals is the realization that there is nothing really to heal." [...] It is a closed system of thought, viewed as infallible if performed correctly; healing confirms the power of Truth, but its absence derives from the failure, specifically the bad thoughts, of individuals.|$|E
500|$|As {{members of}} the Round Table moved into ventures outside New York City, inevitably the group drifted apart. By the early 1930s the Vicious Circle was broken. Edna Ferber said she {{realized}} it when {{she arrived at the}} Rose Room for lunch one day in 1932 and found the group's table occupied by a family from Kansas. Frank Case was asked what happened to the group. He shrugged and replied, [...] "What became of the reservoir at Fifth Avenue and Forty-Second Street? These <b>things</b> <b>do</b> not last forever." [...] Some {{members of the}} group remained friends after its dissolution. Parker and Benchley in particular remained close up until his death in 1945, although her political leanings did strain their relationship. Others, as the group itself would come to understand when it gathered following Woollcott's death in 1943, simply realized that they had nothing to say to one another.|$|E

He dreams of having his novel, titled Nirvriti (Ecstasy), published in the newspaper. He meets one of the newspaper editors (Vaikom Chandrasekharan Nair), who agrees to read his novel but declines to publish it as Vishwam does not have many writings to his credit. Sita is offered {{a job as a}} sales girl but cannot accept it because she is unable to pay the required security deposit of [...] 1,000.

500|$|The first logicians {{to debate}} {{conditional}} statements were Diodorus Cronus and his pupil Philo. Writing five-hundred years later, Sextus Empiricus {{refers to a}} debate between Diodorus and Philo. Philo regarded all conditionals as true except those which with a correct antecedent had an incorrect consequent, and this meant a proposition such as [...] "if it is day, then I am talking," [...] is true unless it is day and I fall silent. But Diodorus argued that a true conditional {{is one in which}} the antecedent clause could never lead to an untrue conclusion – thus, because the proposition [...] "if it is day, then I am talking" [...] can be false, it is invalid. However, paradoxical propositions were still possible such as [...] "if atomic elements of <b>things</b> <b>do</b> not exist, atomic elements exists." [...] Chrysippus adopted a much stricter view regarding conditional propositions, which made such paradoxes impossible: to him, a conditional is true if denial of the consequent is logically incompatible with the antecedent. This corresponds to the modern-day strict conditional.|$|E

500|$|South Park {{generally}} ends on {{a positive}} note and [...] "resets" [...] upon the next episode, in which way it is connected to traditional television sitcoms, as it does not serialize or employ story arcs with frequency. An example of this format is best characteristic of the show's early years, in which the character of Kenny was killed in each episode. In contrast, the stark, abrupt ending of [...] "You're Getting Old" [...] was inspired by modern television dramas, in which events can go poorly, and the episode ends regardless. The character of Sharon references this in one of the episode's final moments, criticizing, on a meta level, the show's form and reliance on [...] "happy endings." [...] Stone likened this structure to an [...] "immature view of the world": he remarks in the episode's DVD commentary that <b>things</b> <b>do</b> not often end on a [...] "happy" [...] note in real-life. Likewise, the dialogue between Sharon and Randy {{near the end of the}} episode functions as a meta-comment on the show's general form, which is consequently broken.|$|E
500|$|The {{ratings of}} the Itchy & Scratchy Show segment on the Krusty the Clown Show {{suddenly}} fail. Krusty orders the cartoon's producer, Roger Meyers, {{to find a way}} to fix the sagging ratings, or else a Chinese cartoon will replace Itchy and Scratchy. Meyers decides to commission a focus group to discover why Itchy and Scratchy has lost its popularity. Bart and Lisa participate in the study, by watching cartoons and answering the questions. However, <b>things</b> <b>do</b> not go well, with the children contradicting themselves when explaining what they want. Eventually, Lisa tells the executives that there is nothing wrong with the show and that it is as good as it has ever been—but after being on TV for so long, the show does not have as much an impact on audiences as it did in its early years. Meyers thanks Lisa for [...] "saving" [...] Itchy and Scratchy, and decides that his cartoon's salvation lies in a new character. He tells Krusty and his team of writers that this new character should be a dog with [...] "attitude", who will be called Poochie.|$|E

[...] IndieGames.com writer Michael Rose agreed, stating [...] "The game mechanics work really well and it's a very nice concept."
