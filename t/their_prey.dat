5|$|Many wasp lineages, {{including}} those in the families Vespidae, Crabronidae, Sphecidae, and Pompilidae, attack and sting prey items that they use as food for their larvae; while Vespidae usually macerate <b>their</b> <b>prey</b> and feed the resulting bits directly to their brood, most predatory wasps paralyze <b>their</b> <b>prey</b> and lay eggs directly upon the bodies, and the wasp larvae consume them. Apart from collecting prey items to provision their young, many wasps are also opportunistic feeders, and will suck the body fluids of <b>their</b> <b>prey.</b> Although vespid mandibles are adapted for chewing and {{they appear to be}} feeding on the organism, they are often merely macerating it into submission. The impact of the predation of wasps on economic pests is difficult to establish.|$|E
5|$|Pristiophoriformes: These are the sawsharks, with an elongated, toothed snout {{that they}} use for {{slashing}} <b>their</b> <b>prey.</b>|$|E
5|$|Accipitridae is {{a family}} of birds of prey that {{includes}} hawks, eagles, kites, harriers and Old World vultures. They have very large, hooked beaks for tearing flesh from <b>their</b> <b>prey,</b> strong legs, powerful talons, and keen eyesight.|$|E
5000|$|Prairie-Ram (プレーリーラム) - Prairie-rams are {{ubiquitous}} liquivores that impale <b>their</b> <b>prey's</b> {{chest to}} suck out bodily juices. They are two-legged.|$|R
30|$|The {{dynamical}} {{relationship between}} predators and <b>their</b> <b>preys</b> {{is one of}} the dominant subjects in ecology and mathematical ecology due to its universal importance, see [1].|$|R

5|$|Locating prey: The wolves {{travel in}} search of prey through their power of scent, chance encounter, and tracking. Wolves {{typically}} locate <b>their</b> <b>prey</b> by scent, though they must usually be directly downwind of it. When a breeze carrying the prey's scent is located, the wolves stand alert, and point their eyes, ears and nose towards their target. In open areas, wolves may precede the hunt with group ceremonies involving standing nose-to-nose and wagging their tails. Once concluded, the wolves head towards <b>their</b> <b>prey.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mostly nocturnal, {{they rarely}} forage actively, preferring instead to ambush prey {{as it happens}} by. <b>Their</b> <b>prey</b> {{includes}} mammals, birds, amphibians, and lizards.|$|E
5|$|Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst {{others have}} {{specially}} adapted brushy tongues {{and in many}} cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue <b>their</b> <b>prey</b> underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after <b>their</b> <b>prey.</b> Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders. Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{adults of}} these jumping spiders reach {{approximately}} 5 mm of length {{and they can}} mainly be encountered on bushes, where they actively pursue <b>their</b> <b>preys,</b> jumping on them.|$|R
50|$|Carnivores derive {{water from}} <b>their</b> <b>prey's</b> meat and blood. Insectivores, {{such as the}} {{aardwolf}} (a type of hyena) and the southern grasshopper mouse, are thus largely independent from free water.|$|R
5000|$|Adult {{snappers}} often form large {{schools on}} the outer reefs or above sandy areas, mainly to form spawning aggregations. Small brownish juveniles mimic damselfishes of the genus Chromis in order to approach <b>their</b> <b>preys.</b>|$|R
5|$|Pandionidae is {{a family}} of {{fish-eating}} birds of prey possessing a very large, powerful hooked beak for tearing flesh from <b>their</b> <b>prey,</b> strong legs, powerful talons, and keen eyesight. The family is monotypic.|$|E
5|$|Predators may {{identify}} <b>their</b> <b>prey</b> by {{sound as}} well as sight; mimics have accordingly evolved to deceive the hearing of their predators. Bats are nocturnal predators that rely on echolocation to detect <b>their</b> <b>prey.</b> Some potential prey are unpalatable to bats, and produce an ultrasonic aposematic signal, the auditory equivalent of warning coloration. In response to echolocating red bats and big brown bats, tiger moths such as Cycnia tenera produce warning sounds. Bats learn to avoid the harmful moths, but similarly avoid other species such as some pyralid moths that produce such warning sounds as well. Acoustic mimicry complexes, both Batesian and Müllerian, may be widespread in the auditory world.|$|E
5|$|Predatory and parasitoidal wasps subdue <b>their</b> <b>prey</b> by {{stinging}} it. They hunt a {{wide variety}} of prey, mainly other insects (including other Hymenoptera), both larvae and adults.|$|E
50|$|The {{adults of}} these jumping spiders reach {{approximately}} 6 - 7 mm of length {{and they can}} mainly be encountered on low vegetation and on sunny rocks or walls of houses, where they actively pursue <b>their</b> <b>preys.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Ampulex dementor, {{referring}} to its behavioral resemblance with the Dementors, fictional creatures from the Harry Potter Books franchise, who suck <b>their</b> <b>prey's</b> soul, leaving it an empty body with neither thoughts nor emotions, {{in a way}} like the wasp.|$|R
50|$|In Resident Evil 5, the Reaper is a Biological Organic Weapon {{formed by}} {{cockroaches}} mutated by Uroboros virus. Despite being accidental products, they are notoriously lethal for their sharp legs which can pierce <b>their</b> <b>preys</b> {{as well as}} high agility.|$|R
5|$|The Old World flycatchers are a {{large family}} of small {{passerine}} birds mostly restricted to the Old World. These are mainly small arboreal insectivores, many of which, as the name implies, take <b>their</b> <b>prey</b> on the wing.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{evidence}} that shows whiting do not rely on visual cues when feeding, instead using a system based on the vibrations emitted by <b>their</b> <b>prey.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{adults of}} these spiders reach {{approximately}} 5 - 7 mm of length. They prefer dry and hot habitats ("xerothermic") and can mainly be encountered on sunny bushes, shrubs and walls of houses (synanthropic organism), where they actively pursue <b>their</b> <b>preys.</b>|$|R
50|$|Agelena orientalis {{can reach}} a total length of 11 - 13.6 mm in males, 12.2 - 17.7 mm in females. Coloration is yellowish, with a {{characteristic}} {{pattern of the}} upperside of the abdomen. These spiders trap <b>their</b> <b>preys</b> by weaving entangling non-sticky funnel webs.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} venomous animals have been {{experimentally}} found {{to regulate the}} amount of venom they use during predation or defensive situations. Species of anemones, jellyfish, ants, scorpions, spiders, and snakes are found to use their venoms frugally depending on the situation and size of <b>their</b> <b>preys</b> or predators.|$|R
5|$|A few nemerteans are scavengers, {{and these}} {{generally}} have good distance chemoreception ("smell") {{and are not}} selective about <b>their</b> <b>prey.</b> A few species live commensally inside the mantle cavity of molluscs and feed on micro-organisms filtered out by the host.|$|E

40|$|Galcier Bay is a {{suitable}} ecosystem for chaetognaths with <b>their</b> main <b>prey</b> being the relatively abundant Calanus copepods. Evidence supports a separate nursery habitat for juvenile chaetognaths. A significant {{negative correlation between}} chaetognaths and <b>their</b> main <b>prey</b> indicates that chaetognaths do impact the zooplankton community assemblage in Glacier Bay. ...|$|R
50|$|The name bactridine {{is derived}} from the fact that these toxins not only help {{scorpions}} to kill <b>their</b> <b>preys</b> but also protect their bodies from harmful pathogens by inhibiting bacteria growth. In captivity, scorpions spray the toxin over their own bodies which suggest that they use the toxin for protection or cleansing.|$|R
5000|$|Both {{adults and}} nymphs are predators, {{by means of}} their front legs {{modified}} to raptor appendages. They usually wait motionless on flowers for <b>their</b> <b>preys,</b> which consist of various insects, other arthropods and spider species. The prey can also be significantly larger than themselves, and bees, for example, can be successfully hunted.|$|R
