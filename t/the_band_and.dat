5|$|Beginning on 19 February 1971, {{the court}} heard reports from Harrison, John Lennon and Ringo Starr of McCartney's {{attempts}} to control <b>the</b> <b>band,</b> <b>and</b> McCartney's equally unflattering assessment of Klein. Although the other three former Beatles had presented a united front against McCartney since his April 1970 departure from the band, the recent publication of Lennon's scathing comments to Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner, about McCartney, Harrison and Starr, added to the ill-feeling surrounding the group.|$|E
5|$|Bloc Party {{commissioned}} Silent Alarm Remixed to {{show that}} remixes and dance music were relevant to <b>the</b> <b>band</b> <b>and</b> to the rock landscape at large. The band members gave each of the original tracks {{to a number of}} musicians from different genres; Ladytron, Four Tet, and Nick Zinner were amongst those who reworked the songs. Critics often considered the record as showcasing the potential high quality of remix albums, although some reviewers treated it as disjunct and a poor marketing decision.|$|E

5|$|Due to Tool's {{incorporation}} {{of visual arts}} and very long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transcending act and part of progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and art rock. The relationship between <b>the</b> <b>band</b> <b>and</b> today's music industry is ambivalent, at times marked by censorship, and the band's insistence on privacy.|$|E
