This paper empirically investigates the trade remedy and WTO dispute settlement interaction by focusing on determinants of WTO members’ decisions of whether <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> U. S. trade remedies imposed between 1992 and 2003. While I confirm that the size of the economic market at stake and the capacity to retaliate under potentially authorized sanctions influence the decision <b>to</b> formally <b>challenge</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure,</b> I also find that if the negatively affected foreign industry has the capacity to directly retaliate through <b>a</b> reciprocal antidumping <b>measure</b> of its own, its government is less likely to pursue the case on its behalf at the WTO. I speculate that potential complainants may be avoiding WTO litigation in favor of pursuing reciprocal antidumping and hence “vigilante justice. ”...|$|R
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} three-part {{conceptualisation}} {{of the use}} of Facebook in ethnographic research: as a tool, as data and as context. Longitudinal research with young adults at a time of significant change provides many challenges for the ethnographic researcher, such as maintaining channels of communication and high rates of participant attrition. Facebook offers <b>a</b> resolution <b>to</b> such <b>challenges</b> as <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> of maintaining research interest and relationships, alongside its potential as a unique research tool and rich source of data on students' reading and writing practices. Despite significant methodological and ethical issues arising from the use of Facebook in the research study presented, this article argues that the benefits of using Facebook, such as its potential for maintaining communication, providing context and generating data, override any such issues and offers valuable insights and commentary on facilitating online–offline longitudinal research with young people...|$|R
40|$|Antidumping {{and related}} trade {{remedies}} {{are the most}} popular policy instruments that many of the largest importing countries in the World Trade Organization (WTO) system use to restrict international trade. While such trade remedies are also frequent targets of dispute settlement activity under the WTO, given that Panel and Appellate Body rulings have almost invariably found that some aspect of each reviewed remedy was inconsistent with WTO obligations, an open research question is why aren't more remedies targeted by dispute settlement? The author provides a first empirical investigation of the trade remedy and WTO dispute settlement interaction by focusing on determinants of WTO members'decisions of whether <b>to</b> formally <b>challenge</b> U. S. trade remedies imposed between 1992 and 2003. He provides evidence that {{it is not only the}} size of the economic market at stake and the capacity to retaliate under potential DSU (dispute settlement understanding) -authorized sanctions that influence the litigation decision of whether <b>to</b> formally <b>challenge</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> at the WTO. The author also finds that if the negatively affected foreign industry has the capacity to directly retaliate through a reciprocal antidumping investigation and measure of its own, its government is less likely to pursue the case on its behalf at the WTO. This is consistent with the theory that potential complainants may be avoiding WTO litigation in favor of pursuing reciprocal antidumping and hence"vigilante justice.

25|$|On July 16, 2008, the California Supreme Court {{denied a}} {{petition}} {{calling for the}} removal of Proposition 8 from the November ballot. The petition asserted the proposition should not be on the ballot on the grounds it was a constitutional revision that only the Legislature or a constitutional convention could place before voters. Opponents also argued that the petitions circulated to qualify the measure for the ballot inaccurately summarized its effect. The court denied the petition without comment. As a general rule, it is improper for courts <b>to</b> adjudicate pre-election <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure's</b> substantive validity. The question of whether Proposition 8 is a constitutional amendment or constitutional revision was ruled on by the California Supreme Court on May 26, 2009, and found {{that it was not a}} revision and therefore would be upheld. They also declared that the same-sex marriages performed prior to the passing of Prop 8 would remain valid.|$|R
40|$|Building {{occupancy}} {{information is}} a crucial factor {{that should be considered}} in the control strategy of building operations for improved energy efficiency and occupant comfort. As occupancy is stochastic and <b>challenging</b> <b>to</b> <b>measure,</b> <b>a</b> number of real-time occupancy detection systems comprising multiple sensors within a wireless network (WSN) using technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID) and WIFI enabled devices have been proposed for use in large commercial office buildings. However due to high deployment cost and need for management of additional infrastructure for these systems, its application in demand driven control of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) is limited notwithstanding the accruable worthwhile energy saving potentials. In this paper, some of this new technologies are briefly discussed and compared with opportunistic implicit building infrastructures which can be exploited for realtime demand driven HVAC control based on the application of the Kesselring decision support method...|$|R

Thorough assessment of both the service itself and the collections selected for digitization can demonstrate {{the success of the}} project as well as the value of the digital library and will aid future funding requests. As evident in the research literature, while digital libraries are often evaluated on the basis of usability, only rarely are users asked about the value or usefulness of the content of the digital library. Useful or valued collections will attract additional users, will help inform decision making for future projects and will make evident to funding agencies that resources have been well spent. Usefulness, however, is amorphous and <b>challenging</b> <b>to</b> <b>measure.</b> <b>A</b> digital library of archival materials developed at a large academic institution was used as the case study. The goals of this project were to determine how to ask users about usefulness and value of collections in the digital library; and to collect statistical data applicable to the question of usefulness. Combinations of both qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed, presuming that the multiple perspectives and data points would lead to comprehensive and actionable results. The data gathering methods included web and database analytics as well as interviews and a survey. The research resulted in specific suggestions for the improvement of the digital library, results applicable to many digital libraries...|$|R
40|$|Stellar-mass {{black holes}} and neutron stars {{represent}} extremes in gravity, density, and magnetic fields. They therefore serve as key {{objects in the}} study of multiple frontiers of physics. In addition, their origin (mainly in core-collapse supernovae) and evolution (via accretion or, for neutron stars, magnetic spindown and reconfiguration) touch upon multiple open issues in astrophysics. In this review, we discuss current mass and spin measurements and their reliability for neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes, as well as the overall importance of spins and masses for compact object astrophysics. Current masses are obtained primarily through electromagnetic observations of binaries, although future microlensing observations promise to enhance our understanding substantially. The spins of neutron stars are straightforward to measure for pulsars, but the birth spins of neutron stars are more difficult to determine. In contrast, even the current spins of stellar-mass black holes are <b>challenging</b> <b>to</b> <b>measure.</b> <b>As</b> we discuss, major inroads have been made in black hole spin estimates via analysis of iron lines and continuum emission, with reasonable agreement when both types of estimate are possible for individual objects, and future X-ray polarization measurements may provide additional independent information. We conclude by exploring the exciting prospects for mass and spin measurements from future gravitational wave detections, which are expected to revolutionize our understanding of strong gravity and compact objects.

40|$|The {{collection}} of meteorites in Antarctica has greatly stimulated advancement {{in the field}} of meteoritics by providing the community with significant numbers of rare and unique meteorites types and by yielding large numbers of meteorites that sample older infall epochs (Grady et al., 1998). The majority of Antarctic meteorites are found on blue ice fields, where they are thought to be concentrated by wind and glacial drift (cf. Cassidy et al., 1992). The basic "ice flow model" describes the concentration of meteorites by the stagnation or slowing of ice as it moves against a barrier located in a zone with low snow accumulation. However, our limited knowledge of the details of the actual concentration mechanisms prevents establishing firm conclusions concerning the past meteorite flux from the Antarctic record (Zolensky, 1998). The terrestrial ages of Antarctic meteorites indicate that their concentration occurs on time scales of tens to hundreds of thousands of years (Nishiizumi et al., 1989). It is <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> <b>measure</b> <b>a</b> mechanism that operates so slowly, and since such time scales can span more than one glacial epoch one cannot assume that the snow accumulation rates, ice velocities and directions, etc. that are measured today are representative of those extant over the age of the trap. Testing the basic "ice flow model" therefore requires the careful measurement of meteorite locations, glacialogical ice flow data, ice thicknesses, bedrock and surface topology, ice ablation and snow accumulation rates, and mass transport by wind {{over an extended period of}} time in a location where these quantities can be interpreted in the context of past glacialogical history...|$|R
