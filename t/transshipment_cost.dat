This {{is the first time}} that transshipments are examined in a dynamic or deterministic setting. We consider a system of two locations which replenish their stock from a single supplier, and where transshipments between the locations are possible. Our model includes fixed (possibly joint) and variable replenishment costs, fixed and variable <b>transshipment</b> <b>costs,</b> as well as holding costs for each location and <b>transshipment</b> <b>costs</b> between locations. The problem is to determine how much to replenish and how much to transship each period; thus this work can be viewed as a synthesis of transshipment problems in a static stochas-tic setting and multilocation dynamic deterministic lot sizing problems. We provide interesting structural properties of optimal policies which enhance our understanding of the important issues which motivate transshipments and allow us to develop an efficient polynomial time algorithm for obtaining the optimal strategy.

H 577 P LMS 2017 Xiaviii, 103 pages :color illustrationsLiner {{shipping}} network {{design is}} a comprehensive decision problem for the carrier to plan their service operations. A series of related decisions from tactical and operational levels are coordinated to maximize the profits. In this thesis, we study two network design problems for carriers in liner shipping. The first work focuses on the joint decision makings for the network design, in which a general fuel consumption function is assumed. The second work studies the solution to a compact optimization model for the network design, in which the <b>transshipment</b> <b>cost</b> is taken into account. In this thesis, we have developed novel optimization techniques to solve both problems. In the first study, we develop a mathematical programming model that addresses fleet deployment, speed optimization, and cargo allocation jointly, so as to maximize total profits for carriers at the strategic level. To capture fuel costs precisely, our model adopts a general fuel consumption function that depends on both vessel speed and vessel load. To overcome intractability caused by nonlinear terms in the model, we separate fuel consumption costs into two terms associated with ship speed and ship load, respectively, so as to obtain a mixed integer linear programming formulation for approximation. Based on column generation techniques, we develop an iterative search algorithm that adaptively reorganizes the approximated formulation. We conduct extensive experiments using generated data sets from actual liner shipping services in {{different regions of the}} world to show the effectiveness of our approach as well as the significant impact of speed-load factors on fuel consumptions. Managerial insights are obtained by testing the model under different scenarios, which may greatly assist decision makers in the liner shipping industry. In the second study, we study a problem that aims at creating a set of regular services for a designated fleet of oceangoing ships to transport the containerized cargos among seaports. Containers can be transshipped from one ship to another at an intermediate port in order to improve the transportation efficiency. The objective of the problem is to maximize the revenues from the satisfied demands while minimizing the operating cost including the <b>transshipment</b> <b>cost.</b> For this issue, many solution methods known to be effective for problems assuming zero <b>transshipment</b> <b>cost</b> cannot directly apply, because the calculation of <b>transshipment</b> <b>cost</b> has significantly complicated the problem and its mathematical formulation. To tackle this challenge, we develop for this problem a new compact mixed-integer linear programming model. However, the new model may contain exponentially many variables and constraints, making its solution very challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel application of simultaneous column-and-row generation to solve the linear programming relaxation of the new model, so as to derive an upper bound for the profit of an optimal network design. Based on this, we have developed a branch-and-price to find optimal or near-optimal integer solutions for this problem.

S.) : Bilkent University, Department of Industrial Engineering, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2015. Assortment planning, i. e., determining {{the set of}} products to offer to customers is a challenging task with immediate effects on profitability, market share and customer service. In this thesis, we study a multiple location assortment planning problem in a make-to-order environment. Each location has the exibility to access others' assortments by transshipping products he/she does not keep. This allows them to offer higher variety and increase sales without increasing costs associated with assortment. Customer behavior is defined using exogenous demand model where each arriving customer to a location chooses a product with an exogenous probability among all possible options. In our multiple location setting, {{we assume that the}} customer has access to the complete assortment in all locations. If a customer's requested product is not available in that customer's assigned location but available in another location, the firm ships the product to the customer at the same price and incurs a <b>transshipment</b> <b>cost.</b> If his/her first choice product is not offered by any of the locations then he/she switches to a substitute product, which can be either satisfied from customer's assigned location, or by transshipment. Otherwise, it is lost. The problem is then to determine the assortment in each location such that the total expected profit is maximized. We first show that the optimal assortments are nested, i. e., the assortment of a location with a smaller market share is a subset of the assortment of a location with a larger market share. We then show that while the common assortment is in the popular set (i. e., some number of products with highest purchase probabilities), the individual assortments do not necessarily have this property. We also derive a sufficient condition for each assortment to be in the popular set. In the final part of the thesis, we conduct an extensive numerical study to understand the effects of various parameters such as assortment cost and <b>transshipment</b> <b>cost</b> on optimal assortments and effects of allowing transshipments on resulting assortments compared to a no-transshipment system. Finally, we introduce an approximation algorithm that benefits from the structural properties obtained in this study and also test its performance with extensive numerical analyses. by Hilal Dağ. M.

40|$|The global {{trend of}} {{urbanization}} is evident and also valid in Sweden {{and for the}} Stockholm-Mälaren region, {{also referred to as}} the Mälaren valley, a region consisting of metropolitan Stockholm and areas around the lake of Mälaren. In this context, efficient urban freight transportation has emerged as essential for sustainable development of urban areas. Geographic regions are being expanded {{due to the fact that}} rapid transport options have expanded the range of action of people and businesses. Metropolitan regions require freight transports that are often categorized by an inflow of consumables and an outflow of waste and recyclable material. Within urban areas there are ports, terminals and storage facilities that require incoming and outgoing transport. Altogether, these shipments have led to increased congestion on the road network within urban areas, which is a contributing factor to why a shift to intermodal land transports have been advocated both in Europe and in Sweden, thus encouraging more freight to be moved from road to rail. Another contributing factor is the relatively low impact on the environment generated by rail transportation. Efficient use of resources and low emissions of greenhouse gases are factors that are in favor of the train as a transport mode. Furthermore, conventional rail freight is commonly competitive on long distances and in end-point relations between two nodes. However, an intermodal liner train, as a transport system for freight differs from conventional rail freight transport systems, as it similar to a passenger train makes stops along the route for loading and unloading. Due to the stops made at intermediate stations it enables the coverage of a larger market area. For regional or inter-regional relations, the concept has the potential of reducing drayage by truck to and from intermodal terminals and to make rail freight competitive also over medium and short distances. The main aim of this thesis project has been to analyze under which conditions a combined transport system with the railway as a base can be implemented in the Stockholm-Mälaren region. Based on a case study for a shipper distributing daily consumables in the region, the feasibility of creating a regional rail freight transport system has been evaluated. This study provides a methodology for evaluating the feasibility, regarding costs and emissions, of concepts and technologies within freight transportation chains. This has been accomplished by the development of a cost modal, Intermodal Transport Cost Model (ITCM). From the results of the case study one can conclude that a regional rail based intermodal transport system regarding costs is on the threshold of feasibility in the studied region. As for emissions, all evaluated intermodal transport chains contribute to a significant decrease in CO 2 emissions compared to unimodal road haulage. The loading space utilization of the train and the <b>transshipment</b> <b>cost</b> are the most critical parameters. The latter restricting the competitiveness of intermodal services to long distances as it is not proportional to transported distance but rather to the utilization rate of resources. Hence, the concept of cost-efficient small scale (CESS) terminals is introduced in this study. A main prerequisite in order to make the intermodal liner train efficient is a stable and balanced flow of goods with optimized loading space utilization along the route. As the objective is to consolidate small flows, imbalances along the route will constitute an obstacle for the liner train to be competitive. Thus regarding loading space utilization it is necessary to consolidate other freight flows in the train in order to achieve high loading space utilization and a balanced flow along the route. The third parameter which is critical for the results are the fuel prices, where a sensitivity analysis of the results shows that if diesel prices would increase so would the feasibility of the intermodal option. The same is also valid for train length increase as long as the loading space utilization is maintained. The results of the feasibility study indicate that the evaluated transshipment technologies are closing the gap for intermodal transport to unimodal road haulage regarding transport cost over short- and medium distances and that they contribute to a substantial reduction of CO 2 emissions. However, it is essential that also the transport quality is ensured, especially regarding reliability and punctuality. Thus a demonstration project is recommended as these aspects require operational testing. This is particularly crucial regarding novel transshipment technologies.   QC 20130530 Regional kombitransportsystem i Mälardale...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{carries out}} the {{capacity}} expansion strategy for port in a competition environment. A new model which deals sea port as a node in the logistic chain {{will be built}} in this study. And the port of Rotterdam and port of Antwerp {{will be used as}} a special case study. Nowadays containers are widely used in world trade business. Millions of containers are being moved from one point to another every single day. In the last decades, world container traffic has increased enormously because of the increasing wodd population and the more specific needs of customers. The world container traffic increased from around 100 Million TEU in 1990 to around 400 Million TEU in 2005 (Hofstra University). And the container traffic is expected to remain growing in the future. The growth in international container shipping will continue with the expected percentage of 9 % annually up to 2015 (Heymann, 2006). Ports, as facilities for accommodate ships and transferring cargoes, play essential nodes in maritime-land freight transport network. The strong growth in container industry, gives a good opportunity for port development on one hand. On the other hand, ports are facing great pressure of handling with the rapid-growing container traffic. Due to the enormous growth in total demand and uncertain demand fluctuation in short periods, ports are always faced with capacity problems, either short-capacity or over-capacity. When taking into account new trends in containerization, and intensively increasing competition among ports in regional port clusters, port planning in capacity will become even more significant. Therefore, developing best strategies to deal with port capacity expansion problems in competitive environments is a main challenge faced by port authonties. In order to provide information to port authorities when they make port capacity expansion strategies, simulation models are widely used. In these simulation models, main focus is on hinterland transport network, because of the quality of hintedand transport has become increasingly important for the competitiveness of a seaport (Konings, 2007). Basically, two types of approaches for transport modeling can be used in transportation planning concerning port capacity problems. One is simulation of route assignment in network, e. g. the SMILE model (Strategic Model for Integrated Logistics and Evaluation) developed by the Dutch institute TNO, which simulates the assignment of freight flows for different commodity types and transportation modes. The other one is projection of port demand based on macro-economic relationships with a more or less fixed market share for a particular port. The example of this second approach is the GSM model (Goederen Stromen Model) used by the Port of Rotterdam. But there are some limitations in these two approaches. The first approach does not account for port development. This approach mainly focuses on hinterland transportation network. However, port investment characteristics are not taken into account in this approach. The second approach accounts for port development, but does not incorporate the potential changes in a port's market share caused by, for instance, competition between transportation routes or port service level. In this case, it is essential to develop a new model, which combine these two fore-mentioned approaches, with the capability of both simulating the effect of competition and incorporating autonomous demand growth. In this thesis, a new concept is formulated that sea port is considered as a node in total logistic chain. A new dynamic port planning model is developed with Microsoft Excel Program. In this port planning model, factors of port capacity, port-commercial and public interests, port competition, capacity problems of hinterland infrastructures are all taken into consideration. An actor analysis is firstly carried out in the thesis. The main actors in container industry are analyzed, including terminal operators, port authorities, shipping companies, inland transport operators, manufacturers and consignees. Market share, port utilization, traffic volume, and unit cost are concluded as the main interests of port authorities. Based on the conclusions of actor analysis, the port planning model is developed with three key inputs, including (1) port residence cost and congestion; (2) port investment cost; (3) hintedand transport cost and congestion. This model is developed based on the following iterative mechanism: In one year, these three aspects (i. e. port residence cost, port investment cost, and hintedand transport cost) determine the unit <b>transshipment</b> <b>cost</b> per TEU of this same year and ultimately determine ports' market share of the same year. However, the market share of this year would determine the three costs of the next following year (i. e. port residence cost, port investment cost, and hintedand transport cost). In the iterative process, several other factors are also included. Port capacity also affects the port residence cost of the same year. The new capacity added is another factor that affects the port investment costs of the same year. Hintedand infrastructure also affects the hintedand transport cost of the same year. A case study is earned out by means of the port-planning model. In this case study, port of Antwerp and port of Rotterdam are chosen as the two competition ports. Time honzon of 30 years is analyzed with thirty iterations. First of all, a general descnption of both ports is shown, including geographical location, histoncal overview, port statistics, hintedand connection, future expansion planning and containenzation in each port. Based on this basic port information, five scenarios and assumptions are made as follows: changing expansion plans; changes in port congestion; changes in hintedand congestion; global economy development; combination of strategies with uncertainty. The first two scenarios (changing expansion plans and changes in port congestion) can be fully determined by port authorities. Transport & PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{supply chain}} {{management}} is currently recognized as a key determinant of competitiveness and success in manufacturing and services, because the implementation of {{supply chain management}} has signiﬁcant impact on cost, service and quality. Numerous strategies for achieving these targets have been proposed. The improvements in information technology coupled with the substantial reduction {{in the cost of}} processing, storing and analyzing data have made new strategies more attractive. On such strategy allows movements of stock between locations at the same echelon level via lateral transshipment. Despite the above technology improvements, the implementation of such transshipment strategy requires still great eﬃciency especially in real life problems, because it suffers from computer memory limits and long computation times when the number of warehouses gets large, or when the number of parallel items to ba analyzed following an item approach gets large, too. In fact, a drawback of the policy of interest is the state dependent nature of the re-forwardings in the systems. Therefore an effective tactical planning requires joint contribution from various disciplines in order to be implemented eﬃciently, such as engineering, mathematics, economics and computer science. New solution methods have to be explored in order to effectively implementing new management strategies. This thesis uses operations research techniques in order to study a single echelon, one-for-one ordering policy with complete pooling, with a deterministic rule for lateral transshipments. Speciﬁcally we propose new evaluation and optimization methods thus handling real life problems within a reasonable amount of computation time. In fact, we test all the proposed methods on the practical case study motivated by the practical needs of an Italian logistics, supporting the activity of 38 civil airports spread over the Italian territory. The company handles 17 warehouses and manages the overall process of purchasing, holding, ensuring that the overall reliability of safety equipments is always within contractual limits. The aim of the company is therefore to grant the prescribed quality of service at minimum cost. The items to be managed in such a context are typically expensive ones and with low demand, but we clearly recognize that there are many different types of service parts and that they perform many different functions. Therefore, in such a context also parts with a lower ratio between holding and transshipment costs may be encountered and managed. Thus with all the uncertainties that exist, a tactical plan should be created that will provide the ﬂexibility needed to meet a wide range of scenarios, pointing the attention on the characteristics of the majority of items. Common techniques models the management policy with a Markov chain approach, thus evaluating such a policy given a spare parts allocation. The optimal stock allocation problem is formulated as an integer program with non linear objective function and non linear constraints. Therefore total enumeration methods or approximation algorithms can be employed for optimally solve it. Based on the needs summarized above, the following research objectives have been achieved in this dissertation. We have focused on a single echelon one-forone ordering policy with complete pooling, with a deterministic rule for lateral transshipments. We have formalized mathematically the Spares Allocation Problem (SAP) and have understood its mathematical structure for building an exact algorithm for optimally allocating the spares. In fact, in literature {{to the best of our}} knowledge no exact algorithm has been proposed for allocating optimally the spares in a continuous review setting rather than a total enumerative algorithm. By exploiting the above algorithm it is interesting – Making insight in the SAP and underline which factors inﬂuence inventories in such a context. – Evaluating fast and accurate heuristics for SAP. Efficient and accurate models for assessing the performance of a single echelon replenishment policy have been proposed and evaluated especially for large numbers of locations. A drawback of the policy of interest is the state dependent nature of the re-forwardings in the systems, it has been therefore interesting. – understanding the properties of the Markov chain associated to the chosen policy. – exploring, despite its state dependent nature, the possibility of expressing the state probabilities of the associated Markov chain model exactly in product form – developing fast and accurate approximate models for evaluating the performance and costs in the system, since computing the state probabilities is not practical as the number of states in the Markov chain increases. The achievement of the ﬁrst objective clearly required a strong connection with the resolution of the second objective. In fact, the development of an exact algorithm for allocating the spares may require in contexts with a large number of warehouses and high rates approximate models for assessing the performance and evaluating the costs. Speciﬁcally, n this thesis by using a suitable optimization model we have shown that the Markov chain cannot be decomposed exactly in product form. In fact, the best product form approximation returns a positive accuracy error, which implies that an exact product form does not exist. Hence, we have adapted four approximation techniques to our model and evaluate their performance in terms of computational effort, memory requirement and error with respect to the exact value. Three techniques approximate state probabilities with others that can be expressed in product form, so that the Markov chain can be decomposed. Speciﬁcally, we adapt a method by Alfredsson and Verrijdt, the Equivalent Random Traﬃc (ERT) method and the Interrupted Poisson Process (IPP) method. The last two techniques have been proposed for exploring the inﬂuence of peakedness in approximation models with respect to the accuracy of performance estimation due to the state dependent nature of the re-forwardings in the system. The fourth technique is based on the multi-dimensional scaling down approach, which studies an equivalent reduced Markov chain rather than decomposing the original one. The scaling down method outperforms the decomposition techniques for small OA values (OA < 0. 997), while the percentage error is similar for larger OA values. Besides the better performance shown in ﬁgure, in our experiments the scaling down method provides OA values smaller than the exact ones in more than 80 % of the experiments while the decomposition methods ﬁnd OA values always larger than the exact ones. The scaling down method is therefore more conservative than the decomposition methods, and this is an important feature when the method has to be used within an optimization The formulation and solution of the Spares Allocation Problem (SAP) is one of the main achievements of this thesis. The mathematical structure of the problem has been investigated to build an eﬃcient exact algorithm for optimally allocating the spares. Two assumption on the cost structure of the problem leads to prove properties of the cost function that in turns allow to design a new efficient branch and bound procedure. The lower bound is obtained by solving a reduced problem with convex objective function, solvable at optimally very efficiently. A new fast heuristic algorithm is also developed to ﬁnd a feasible allocation within small computation time. Computational experiments demonstrate that the branch and bound technique is able to optimally solve almost all tested instances within reasonable computation time. The heuristic algorithm ﬁnds quite good solutions within very limited computation time, thus being a promising approach for ﬁnding feasible solutions to difficult instances. Moreover we have analyzed several cost structure scenarios and we have observed that the <b>transshipment</b> <b>cost</b> is often comparable with the holding cost and therefore it cannot be neglected in the solution of the problem...|$|E

This paper provides a new basic framework for automatic preferences (AP) data and automatic choice (AC) methods when applied subconscious choices on modes of transport and the associations of positive qualities and modal choices. The framework also includes the observable attributes of travel time, waiting time, number of <b>transshipment,</b> <b>costs,</b> and socioeconomic characteristics of the users, all of which may have an influence in the mode choice. The most relevant results obtained were the automatic association between the car and positive constructs in the car users, and a large difficulty in obtaining an association that is a positive construct to the bus. The bus users also can associate more easily to this mode with positive constructs than the car users...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} and service-oriented transportation network {{is a necessary}} resource for successful less-than-truckload operations. The design, {{as well as the}} evaluation, of transportation networks is mainly driven by quantitative in particular cost-oriented measures, such as transport and <b>transshipment</b> <b>costs.</b> Spatial network centrality is often neglected in transportation network design, even though network centrality {{is at the root of}} many aspects of network performance, for instance schedule reliability and terminal congestion. This paper suggests modifications of the Gini-based network concentration index as well as the hubbing concentration index from the passenger airline context to the less-than-truckload road transportation context. The modified indices assess the concentration of a less-thantruckload network and allow incorporating centrality in a structured way into transportation network design. They provide aggregated information on structural aspects of a network and are thus a starting point for network evaluation and further examination. This paper presents a comparison of network scenarios, which illustrates how the indices provide relevant information for network design decisions...|$|R

A large e-tailer strategically stocks inventory for SKUs with low demand. The motivations are {{to provide a}} wide range of selections and faster customer fulfillment service. We assume the e-tailer has the technological capability to manage and control the inventory globally: all warehouses act as one to serve the global demand simultaneously. The e-tailer will utilize its entire inventory, regardless of location, to serve demand. Thus, given the global demand and an order fulfillment policy, there are trade-offs involving inventory holding <b>costs,</b> <b>transshipment</b> <b>costs,</b> and backordering costs in determining the optimal system inventory level and allocation of inventory to warehouses. For the case of Poisson demand and constant lead time, we develop methods to approximate the key system performance metrics like transshipment, backorders and average system inventory. We then use these results to develop guidelines for inventory stocking and order fulfillment policies for online retailers. Singapore-MIT Alliance (SMA...|$|R
