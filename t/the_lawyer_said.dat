500|$|Yelp also conducts [...] "sting operations" [...] {{to uncover}} {{businesses}} writing their own reviews. In October 2012, Yelp placed a 90-day [...] "consumer alert" [...] on 150 business listings {{believed to have}} paid for reviews. The alert read [...] "We caught someone red-handed trying to buy reviews for this business". In June 2013, Yelp {{filed a lawsuit against}} BuyYelpReview/AdBlaze for allegedly writing fake reviews for pay. In 2013 Yelp sued a lawyer it alleged was {{part of a group of}} law firms that exchanged Yelp reviews, saying that many of the firm's reviews originated from their own office. <b>The</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>said</b> Yelp was trying to get revenge for his own legal disputes and activism against Yelp. An effort to win dismissal of the case was denied in December 2014. In September 2013, Yelp cooperated with Operation Clean Turf, a sting operation by the New York Attorney General that uncovered 19 astroturfing operations. In April 2017, a Norfolk, Massachusetts [...] jury awarded a jewelry store over $34,000 after it determined that its competitor's employee had filed a false negative Yelp review that knowingly caused emotional distress.|$|E

2500|$|According to his family's {{attorney}} {{and a family}} friend, Rodger had seen multiple therapists since he {{was eight years old}} and while he was a student at SBCC. <b>The</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>said</b> that Rodger was [...] "receiving psychiatric treatment", but Rodger was never formally diagnosed with a mental illness. A psychiatrist had prescribed him anti-psychotic medication used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but he refused to take it. According to Rodger's mother, he was diagnosed as having Asperger syndrome, but a formal medical diagnosis of the disorder was not made. He was in fact diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, another autism spectrum disorder, in 2007.|$|E

The letter was addressed to her as “Walker-Black”. Walker had never been married, didn’t use a hyphenated name, and had never had the last name Black. It appeared as if someone forgot to remove the race notation before signing and sending out that letter. James Anderson, Lindner's lawyer, apologized to Walker saying it was a [...] "simple mistake. [...] I {{can tell you that the}} person typing the letter apparently looked at the file and put the words together wrong [...]” Walker said [...] "I do believe it was an accident and somebody forgot to erase it. ...I am an elected official and I deserve respect, and that misprint is a lack of respect." [...] <b>The</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Basically, it's a tempest in a teapot," [...] he said, adding that [...] "some people are just hypersensitive if from a simple mistake they can call someone a racist." [...] Walker responded, [...] "It's easy to say that when you're not on the receiving of a racist comment, but racist attacks are emotionally and mentally draining. And I am far from sensitive. It takes a lot to offend me. ...Folks who are so focused on this issue don't realize that there is a pattern with this particular representative." ...|$|E
