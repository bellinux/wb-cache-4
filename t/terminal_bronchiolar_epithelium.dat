40|$|Terminal {{conducting}} airways {{are known}} to be vulnerable to direct injury by a variety of noxious aerosols. Sulfuric acid aerosol, a by-product of fossil fuel combustion, produces desquamation of <b>terminal</b> <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> in guinea pigs that is believed to result from direct deep lung irritation, an effect separable from reflex airway constriction induced by sulfuric acid. To characterize desquamation of bronchiolar epithelium, 20 guinea pigs were exposed to 32. 6 mg/cu m sulfuric acid aerosol with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 1. 0 micron for 4 hours. The guinea pigs were killed upon termination of the exposure, or 24 hours later, and airway alterations were evaluated by light and transmission electron microscopy. To test whether the development of bronchiolar epithelial desquamation is independent of reflex airway constriction, 24 guinea pigs were exposed to an identical aerosol for 4 hours after pretreating half with 5 mg/kg atropine sulfate intraperitoneally to inhibit airway constriction. Sulfuric acid produced diffuse pulmonary hyperinflation with areas of consolidation and atelectasis. Epithelial desquamation occurred in airways supplying regions of developing atelectasis and was most extensive in terminal bronchioles. Parasympathetic effector blockade with atropine eliminated epithelial desquamation. These results indicate that sulfuric acid-produced desquamation of <b>terminal</b> <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> is not separable from reflex airway constriction and that terminal conducting airways are vulnerable not only to direct injury by noxious aerosols but also to indirect, reflex-mediated injury...|$|E
40|$|Potential factors {{underlying}} the tumorigenic activity of ethyl-benzene (EB) {{were examined in}} F 344 rats and B 6 C 3 F 1 mice inhaling 750 ppm EB vapor 6 h/day, 5 days/week, for one or four weeks. Target tissues (kidneys of rats and livers and lungs of mice) were evaluated for changes in organ weights, mixed function oxygenases (MFO), glucuronosyl transferase activities, S-phase DNA synthesis, apoptosis, 2 u-globulin deposition, and histopa-thology. In male rats, kidney weight increases were accompanied by focal increases in hyaline droplets, 2 u-globulin, degeneration, and S-phase synthesis in proximal tubules. In female rats, only decreased S-phase synthesis and MFO activities occurred. In mice, increased liver weights were accompanied by hepatocellular hy-pertrophy, mitotic figures, S-phase synthesis, and enzyme activi-ties.

40|$|Cell {{proliferation}} in bronchiolar epithelium {{of normal}} mouse lung and of lung chronically exposed to urethane was compared. Animals treated for 10 weeks with drinking water containing 0. 1 % urethane and their controls were injected with 3 H-thymidine; autoradiographs {{were made of}} lung tissue and mean grain counts of labeled nuclei in <b>terminal</b> <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> compared in the control and urethane-treated groups. In controls, the decline in mean grain counts of labeled daughter cells between 24 hours and 4 days after 3 H-thymidine injection was compatible with a mean cell cycle time of about 60 hours. In contrast, the hyperplastic bronchiolar epithelium of the urethane-treated animals showed an elevated labeling index and deficient production of labeled cells over the 6 -day period as judged by decline in mean grain counts. These findings were interpreted as showing that the hyperplasia and high labeling index did not represent faster turnover or shortened cycle but reflected an increase in cell cycle time or of population renewal time...|$|E

30|$|The endothelin axis was {{detectable}} by immunohistochemical staining (examples can {{be found}} in Additional file 1). Staining of ET- 1 was localised to <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> and perivascular smooth muscle in both BD and non-BD animals, with no appreciable difference in expression noted. With regard to the endothelin receptors, ETRA was stained minimally in both groups within <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> and smooth muscle, and ETRB was well localised to airway columnar epithelium. There was no difference in expression of either receptor between groups. Overall, there were no differences in intensity of staining for MMP- 2 or MMP- 9 between groups, with MMP- 2 slightly expressed within vascular endothelial and bronchiolar epithelial cells and MMP- 9 able to be identified within <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> and perivascular smooth muscle.|$|R
40|$|Basigin is {{expressed}} in many tissues during development, including lung. It is also found on tumor cells and in wounds where it is thought to stimulate adjacent fibroblasts to produce matrix metalloproteinases. To investigate whether basigin might be expressed in fibro-inflammatory lung processes, we generated bleomycin-induced lung injury in mice. At 14 d after intratracheal bleomycin, we found basigin prominently in areas of fibrosis, alveolar macrophages, and <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium,</b> whereas it was only weakly present in <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> in untreated mice. Western blots of radioimmunoprecipitation assay RIPA-insoluble fractions of bleomycin-treated lungs showed increased basigin compared with RIPA-insoluble fractions of lung from untreated mice. By quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, lung basigin mRNA was significantly increased 14 d after bleomycin, and by in situ hybridization, basigin mRNA was prominent in <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium.</b> Western blots of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) showed various forms of basigin after bleomycin that were not present in BALF from untreated lung. These results demonstrate that bleomycin-induced lung injury is associated with increased basigin expression in <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium,</b> deposition of basigin in fibrotic sites, and increased basigin in BALF. Accordingly, basigin {{may play a role}} in diffuse alveolar injury...|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{mechanisms}} {{contributing to}} renewal of terminal bronchioles remain poorly defined. Our previous studies identified pollutant-resistant Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) -expressing stem cells that localize to the neuroepithelial body (NEB) {{and contribute to}} renewal of the proximal bronchiolar epithelium. However, activation of NEB-associated stem cells is unlikely to contribute to renewal of <b>terminal</b> <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> because of the paucity of NEBs at this location. Goals {{of this study were}} to determine the location and properties of cells contributing to renewal of terminal bronchioles after Clara cell depletion. Pollutant-resistant CCSP-expressing cells were identified that localized to the bronchoalveolar duct junction (BADJ) and contribute to restoration of a phenotypically diverse epithelium. CCSP-expressing cells comprise the predominant proliferative population in initial terminal bronchiolar repair and include a population of label-retaining cells suggesting that they maintain characteristics of a stem cell population. Furthermore, immunohistochemical co-localization studies involving CCSP and the NEB-specific marker calcitonin gene-related peptide indicate that BADJ-associated CCSP-expressing stem cells function independently of NEB microenvironments. These studies identify a BADJ-associated, NEB-independent, CCSP-expressing stem cell population in terminal bronchioles and support the notion that regiospecific stem cell niches function to maintain epithelial diversity after injury...|$|E
40|$|Regeneration of lung {{epithelium}} {{is vital}} for maintaining airway function and integrity. An imbalance between epithelial damage and repair is at the basis of numerous chronic lung diseases such as asthma, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer. IGF (Insulin-like Growth Factors) signaling {{has been associated with}} most of these respiratory pathologies, although their mechanisms of action in this tissue remain poorly understood. Expression profiles analyses of IGF system genes performed in mouse lung support their functional implication in pulmonary ontogeny. Immuno-localization revealed high expression levels of Igf 1 r (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Receptor) in lung epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and smooth muscle. To further understand the role of Igf 1 r in pulmonary homeostasis, two distinct lung epithelial-specific Igf 1 r mutant mice were generated and studied. The lack of Igf 1 r disturbed airway epithelial differentiation in adult mice, and revealed enhanced proliferation and altered morphology in distal airway club cells. During recovery after naphthalene-induced club cell injury, the kinetics of <b>terminal</b> <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> regeneration was hindered in Igf 1 r mutants, revealing increased proliferation and delayed differentiation of club and ciliated cells. Amid airway restoration, lungs of Igf 1 r deficient mice showed increased levels of Igf 1, Insr, Igfbp 3 and epithelial precursor markers, reduced amounts of Scgb 1 a 1 protein, and alterations in IGF signaling mediators. These results support the role of Igf 1 r in controlling the kinetics of cell proliferation and differentiation during pulmonary airway epithelial regeneration after injury...|$|E
40|$|This 3 -mo {{inhalation}} {{study investigated}} the biological effects of a special-purpose glass microfiber (E-glass microfiber), the stone wool fiber MMVF 21, and a new high-temperature application fiber (calcium-magnesium-silicate fiber, CMS) in Wistar rats. Rats were exposed 6 h/day, 5 days/wk for 3 mo to fiber aerosol concentrations of approximately 15, 50, and 150 fibers/ml (fiber length > 20 µm) for E-glass microfiber and MMVF 21. For the CMS fiber only the highest exposure concentration was used. During a 3 -mo postexposure period, recovery effects were studied. In the highest exposure concentration groups, gravimetric concentrations were 17. 2 mg/m 3 for E-glass microfiber, 37 mg/m 3 for MMVF 21, and 49. 5 mg/m 3 for the CMS fiber. After 3 mo of exposure, lung retention of fibers longer than 20 µm per lung was 17 2 106 for E-glass microfiber, 5. 7 2 106 for MMVF 21, and 0. 88 2 106 for CMS. After 3 mo of recovery the concentration of the long fiber fraction was decreased to 38. 4 %, 63. 9 %, and 3. 0 % compared to original lung burden for the E-glass microfiber, MMVF 21, and CMS, respectively. Biological effects measured included inflammatory and proliferative potential, histopathology lesions, and the persistence of these effects over a recovery period of 3 mo. Generally, observed effects were higher for E-glass microfiber when compared to MMVF 21. The following clear dose-dependent effects on E-glass microfiber and MMVF 21 exposure were observed as main findings of the study: increase in lung weight, in measured biochemical parameters and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), in cell proliferation (BrdU-response) of <b>terminal</b> <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium,</b> and in interstitial fibrosis. The values observed in the proliferation assay on the carcinogenic E-glass microfiber indicate that this assay has an important predictive value with regards to potential carcinogenicity. Surprisingly, for the biosoluble CMS fiber, fibrogenic potential was detected in this study. The results of the CMS exposure group indicate that effects may be dominated {{by the presence of}} nonfibrous particles and that fibrosis may not be a predictor of carcinogenic activity of fiber samples, if the fiber preparation contains a significant fraction of nonfibrous particles. In summary, this study demonstrates the importance of fiber dust contamination by granular components. For future subchronic studies a longer posttreatment observation period would be advisable...|$|E
40|$|Signaling by Wnt/β-catenin regulates {{self-renewal}} {{of tissue}} stem {{cells in the}} gut and, when activated in the embryonic <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium,</b> leads to stem cell expansion. We have used transgenic and cell type–specific knockout strategies to determine roles for β-catenin–regulated gene expression in normal maintenance and repair of the <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium.</b> Analysis of TOPGal transgene activity detected β-catenin signaling in the steady-state and repairing <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium.</b> However, the broad distribution and phenotype of signaling cells precluded establishment of a clear role for β-catenin in the normal or repairing state. Necessity of β-catenin signaling was tested through Cre-mediated deletion of Catnb exons 2 – 6 in airway epithelial cells. Functional knockout of β-catenin had no impact on expression of Clara cell differentiation markers, mitotic index, or sensitivity of these cells to the Clara cell–specific toxicant, naphthalene. Repair of the naphthalene-injured airway proceeded with establishment of focal regions of β-catenin–null epithelium. The size of regenerative epithelial units, mitotic index, and restoration of the ciliated cell population did not vary between wild-type and genetically modified mice. Thus, β-catenin was not necessary for maintenance or efficient repair of the <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis (IPF) is a severe interstitial lung disorder {{characterized by a}} pattern of Usual Interstitial Pneumonia where the presence of fibroblastic foci {{is the hallmark of}} the disease. Aim of the Study: In the present study, we analyzed the migration inhibitory factor (MIF) expression in lung tissue of IPF patients compared with healthy controls and organizing pneumonia (OP) patients focusing into MIF potential role in fibroblastic foci development. Materials and Methods: The immunohistochemical analysis was performed in 10 IPF patients (7 male), 3 OP patients (2 male), and 3 healthy controls (all male) using the streptavidin-biotin method (Dako). Results: In IPF samples, MIF resulted overexpressed in the areas of active fibrosis and, in particular, in the alveolar <b>epithelium,</b> <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium,</b> and in the peripheral zones of fibroblastic foci. <b>Bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> from organizing pneumonia patients resulted only weakly positive for MIF while no evidence of MIF expression was reported for alveolar epithelium. In the control subject group, MIF was unexpressed except for a weak presence in the <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium.</b> Conclusion: In conclusion, MIF is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of IPF being mainly expressed in the areas of remodeling and active fibrosis, in <b>bronchiolar</b> and alveolar <b>epithelium,</b> and in the peripheral zone of fibroblastic foci...|$|R
40|$|Following injury, bronchiolar cells undergo rapid {{squamous}} metaplasia, {{followed by}} proliferation and re-establishment {{of the complex}} columnar epithelium that is characteristic of the normal airway. Mechanisms that regulate the repair of <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> are of considerable relevance for understanding the pathogenesis of both acute and chronic lung diseases associated with airway remodeling. This {{study was designed to}} identify the role of the GP 130 -STAT 3 signaling pathway during repair of the <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium.</b> STAT 3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and GP 130 (glycoprotein 130) were each selectively deleted from the pulmonary epithelial cells of transgenic mice in vivo, producing Stat 3 Δ/Δ and Gp 130 Δ/Δ mice, respectively. Airway injury was induced in adult mice by administration of naphthalene, a toxicant of nonciliated respiratory epithelial cells (Clara cells). Nuclear STAT 3 staining was induced in bronchiolar epithelial cells following naphthalene-mediated injury in control (Stat 3 flox/flox) mice. Whereas nearly complete repair of the <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> was observed in control mice within 13 days, restoration of cell shape, cell density, and the pattern of ciliated and nonciliated cells did not occur in the peripheral bronchioles of either Stat 3 Δ/Δ or Gp 130 Δ/Δ mice. Expression of dominant-negative STAT 3 inhibited airway epithelial cell migration during repair in vitro; wild-type STAT 3 expression activated such migration. In the present study, we show that GP 130 -STAT 3 signaling functions in a cell-autonomous manner to restore cell shape and numbers required for repair of the <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> following injury...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> is {{postulated}} to play {{a critical}} role in the orchestration of responses to inhaled allergens, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma. Using a murine model of allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness, we demonstrate in mice sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) that following a single challenge with nebulized OVA, a rapid and protracted activation of inhibitor of kappa B kinase (IKK) occurred in lung tissue. IKK activation was followed by nuclear localization of nuclear factor (NF) -κB within the <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> and increased luciferase activity in lungs of mice containing a NF-κB-dependent reporter gene. Challenge of sensitized mice with OVA also induced mRNA expression of the chemokines, macrophage inflammatory protein- 2 (MIP- 2) and eotaxin in lung tissue, which corresponded temporally with the observed influx of neutrophils and eosinophils, respectively, into the airspaces. Using laser capture microdissection and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we demonstrated that MIP- 2 and eotaxin were predominantly expressed in <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium,</b> in contrast to distal regions of the lungs, which expressed lower or undetectable levels of these mRNAs.

Methods and results: Peripheral lung sections from smokers with COPD (n = 9) and age-matched controls including smokers (n = 11) and lifelong non-smokers with normal lung function (n = 6) were stained with alcian blue, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and by immunohistochemistry of mucins (MUC) : MUC 2, MUC 4, MUC 5 AC, MUC 5 B and MUC 6. Histochemical staining and immunoreactivity of <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> were graded and {{the presence or absence of}} stained mucus in the bronchiolar lumen was evaluated. There were no differences in alcian blue and PAS epithelial staining between the three groups. Intraluminal PAS staining was significantly more frequent among COPD subjects (P < 0. 05). The expression of MUC 5 AC was significantly higher in the <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> of patients with COPD (P < 0. 05). Within the bronchiolar lumen, the predominant mucin was MUC 5 B. Intraluminal MUC 5 B was significantly more frequent among COPD patients (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: COPD is specifically associated with increased expression of MUC 5 B in the bronchiolar lumen and of the mucin MUC 5 AC in the <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium.</b> These changes in mucin production in the peripheral airways may contribute to the pathophysiology of COPD...|$|R

The localization of HRP was studied by ultrastructural histochemistry. When injected in a small volume of saline (0. 1 ml), HRP was confined in the vascular space. When the volume of saline was increased to 1. 0 ml, the reaction product of HRP was found first in the intercellular junctions of the arterial endothelium and then through the arterial wall. The reaction product was traced from the arterial wall to the peribronchiolar tissue, bronchiolar wall, and the intercellular space of the <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium.</b> HRP was seen in direct contact with the air space in the bronchiole.

We also showed that HFH- 4 is a potent transcriptional activator in cotransfection assays and defined several protein sequences important for HFH- 4 transcriptional activity. We used in vitro DNA-binding site selection with recombinant HFH- 4 protein and determined that the HFH- 4 protein recognizes the DNA consensus sequences HWDTGTTTGTTTA or KTTTGTTGTTKTW (where H is not G, W is A or T, D is not C, and K is G or T). We used this HFH- 4 consensus to identify potential HFH- 4 target genes in the choroid plexus epithelium and demonstrated that these promoter sequences bind to recombinant HFH- 4 protein in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Recombinant HFH- 4 formed specific protein–DNA complexes with the promoter regions of the human prothrombin, beta amyloid precursor protein, α 1 -antichymotrypsin, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and rodent α 2 -macroglobulin, growth hormone receptors, and insulin-like growth factor II genes.

Notably, AhR depletion stimulates an undifferentiated and pluripotent phenotype likely associated to a mesenchymal transition in epithelial cells and to increased primary tumorigenesis and metastasis in melanoma. In this work, {{we have used}} a lung model of epithelial regeneration to investigate whether AhR regulates proper tissue repair by adjusting the expansion of undifferentiated stem-like cells. AhR-null mice developed a faster and more efficient repair of the lung <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> upon naphthalene injury that required increased cell proliferation and the earlier activation of stem-like Clara, Basal and neuroepithelial cells precursors. Increased basal content in multipotent Sca 1 +/CD 31 −/CD 4 − cells and in cells expressing pluripotency factors NANOG and OCT 4 could also improve re-epithelialization in AhR-null lungs. The reduced response of AhR-deficient lungs to Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) repression shortly after injury may also help their improved <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> repair.

METHODS: Four patients with pulmonary histiocytosis X were examined by immunohistochemical techniques for GM-CSF and CD 1 a surface molecules. RESULTS: In early lesions the epithelium of bronchioles affected by the disease was strongly positive for GM-CSF and infiltrated by numerous CD 1 a+ Langerhans' cells organised into granulomas. In contrast, the expression of GM-CSF was substantially lower in bronchioles not affected by the disease, and these bronchioles contained few Langerhans' cells. When destruction by histiocytosis X lesions was more advanced, only remnants of <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> could occasionally be identified; these remained strongly reactive for GM-CSF. Langerhans' cells within granulomas also moderately expressed this cytokine. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that GM-CSF could be one of the factors responsible for the local accumulation of lymphostimulatory Langerhans' cells in early lesions of pulmonary histiocytosis X...|$|R
40|$|Although {{mutations}} in Kras {{are present in}} 21 % of lung tumors, {{there is a high}} level of heterogeneity in phenotype and outcome among patients with lung cancer bearing similar mutations, suggesting that other pathways are important. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a known oncogenic pathway that plays a well-defined role in colon and skin cancer; however, its role in lung cancer is unclear. We have shown here that activation of Wnt/β-catenin in the <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> of the adult mouse lung does not itself promote tumor development. However, concurrent activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and expression of a constitutively active Kras mutant (KrasG 12 D) led to a dramatic increase in both overall tumor number and size compared with KrasG 12 D alone. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling altered the KrasG 12 D tumor phenotype, resulting in a phenotypic switch from <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> to the highly proliferative distal progenitors found in the embryonic lung. This was associated with decreased E-cadherin expression at the cell surface, which may underlie the increased metastasis of tumors with active Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Together, these data suggest that activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling can combine with other oncogenic pathways in lung epithelium to produce a more aggressive tumor phenotype by imposing an embryonic distal progenitor phenotype and by decreasing E-cadherin expression...|$|R
40|$|Hamsters {{exposed to}} 10 ppm NO 2 for 5 hr {{once a week}} for 4 weeks while {{undergoing}} acute vitamin A deficiency showed much reduced epithelial cell regeneration in the terminal bronchioles. Quantitative analysis done by autoradiography and scintillation counting from lung tissues indicates much reduced cell kinetics occurring in <b>terminal</b> <b>bronchiolar</b> alveolar region. Alveolar necrosis was often observed and no type II cell reversion occurred. Virus particles were found within the alveolar epithelial plasma membrane...|$|R
40|$|Oral {{administration}} (20 mg/kg) of O,O,S-trimethyl phosphorothioate (OOS) causes delayed toxicity in rats; ie, death {{occurs as}} late as 28 days after treatment. OOS-treated rats show morphologic changes in the <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> of the lung; nonciliated (Clara) cells are fewer but larger 3 days after treatment. We have now found that pretreatment with the P- 450 -dependent mixed-function oxidase inducer, phenobarbital, protects against the morphologic changes caused by OOS. These results {{support the view that}} the lung is a target organ of the delayed toxicity caused by OOS and that OOS detoxification is mediated by P- 450 -dependent metabolism...|$|R
40|$|The {{localisation}} of a low-molecular-weight bronchial {{protease inhibitor}} (LMI) in human peripheral lung tissue was studied by an immunohistochemical method. This inhibitor was found exclusively {{in a part}} of the non-ciliated cell population of the <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium.</b> An inverse relationship was observed between the number of LMI-positive non-ciliated cells per millimetre of basement membrane and the bronchiolar diameter. These findings may have a bearing on the protease-antiprotease theory of the development of pulmonary emphysema, LMI possibly playing a part in the protection of peripheral lung tissue against proteolytic destruction by enzymes liberated from granulocytes or migrating alveolar macrophages...|$|R
40|$|During {{the summer}} and fall of 1990 {{hundreds}} of striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) died in the Spanish Mediterranean as a result of morbillivirus infection. A pathological investigation was carried out on dolphins from Valencia and Murcia which {{were among the first to}} die in the epizootic. The dolphins were in poor body condition and pneumonia was the main necropsy finding. Microscopic lung lesions characterized by necrosis of bronchial and <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> and infiltration of alveoli with macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils and multinucleated syncytia were seen in most dolphins. Cytoplasmic and nuclear eosinophilic viral inclusions were present in bronchial and <b>bronchiolar</b> <b>epithelium</b> and in syncytia. Focal granulomatous inflammation associated with nematodes was also present. Brain lesions included diffuse degeneration and necrosis of neurons, microgliosis, perivascular cuffing, formation of syncytia and focal demyelination. Cytoplasmic and nuclear eosinophilic inclusions were present in neurons and glial cells. There was severe lymphoid necrosis and depletion of spleen and lymph nodes and syncytia also occurred in lymph nodes. Biliary and transitional epithelium contained nuclear and cytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions. Immunoperoxidase staining using monoclonal antibodies to phocine distemper virus confirmed the presence of morbillivirus antigens in lung and brain. The distribution and severity of lesions in striped dolphins are similar to those of distemper in seals, harbor porpoises and terrestrial mammals. The formation of syncytia in the lung and brain may be a useful pathological indicator of morbillivirus infection and may be used in the investigation of pinniped and cetacean strandings in North America...|$|R
