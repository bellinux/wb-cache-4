5|$|From <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> <b>days,</b> the line's colours were: funnels– {{dark red}} with black top and thin black band; hulls– black with white boot topping. During the Second World War, ships were painted in {{battleship}} grey {{and the names}} were deleted for security, except when in friendly ports. From the 1960s onwards, some ships' hulls were painted light grey and others red.|$|E

5|$|German {{submarine}} U-36 was a Type VIIA U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine {{which served}} during World War II. She {{was constructed in}} <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> <b>days</b> of the U-boat arm at Kiel in 1936, and served in the pre-war Navy in the Baltic Sea and North Sea under Kapitänleutnant (Kptlt.) Klaus Ewerth. Korvettenkapitän (K.Kapt.)Wilhelm Fröhlich took command in October 1938 and continued in the role until the boat was lost.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> <b>days</b> of the Vietnam War, North Vietnam {{supplied}} the Viet Cong in the South by two methods. The first was {{to extend the}} Ho Chi Minh Trail southward into the tri-border region of Laos/Cambodia/South Vietnam. The Trail, a labyrinth of paths, roads, river transportation systems and way-stations, was constantly being expanded and improved. It served as a logistical jugular vein, {{for both men and}} material, for the North Vietnamese war effort against South Vietnam. The second method was to transport supplies by sea.|$|E

5|$|A {{hallmark}} of the curriculum in <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> <b>days</b> was study organized around major themes—trees, Shakespeare, Egypt and other subjects—that built over the school year into major class projects, performances, and all-school gatherings. Many of these themes and events have grown into lasting school traditions, with which the school community has come to identify each group and certain times of year. One the school's most cherished traditions, tapping maple trees to make syrup, began with the move to the new building in 1929. The Spring Fair, in which groups one through five each prepare and perform their own dance, has been held annually since the 1930s—the Maypole dance by the fifth group {{dates back to the}} beginning of the Cottage School.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{modernity and}} {{the merit of}} the works {{produced}} {{and the ability of}} its protagonists, the historiography of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia was never able to win the honors of artistic and literary culture, neither at the time, nor in the following centuries, being forgotten even by the local sources. The main cause {{is to be found in}} a long series of errors and omissions that occurred in the critical literature from <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> <b>days</b> until the twentieth century, which led to the misunderstanding of the cultural level and quality achieved by the Brescia school during the thirty years from the turn of the fifteenth century, and the oblivion of its main characters.|$|E
5|$|From a young age, Jackson {{was exposed}} to sex. He {{received}} mixed messages on the subject from his parents. His mother Katherine was a devout Jehovah's Witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly; lust in thought or deed was sinful outside of marriage, and physical intimacy should be saved for marriage. In contrast to his wife, father Joseph, a steel mill worker, shunned the religion and would have The Jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and seedy bars in <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> <b>days</b> of their career. He allowed nine-year-old Michael to watch from {{the wings of the}} stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude. In one incident, a fascinated Michael watched as an apparently big breasted female removed all but her underwear. The stripper then proceeded to reach into her bra, removing two large oranges and the wig from her head, to reveal that the person he thought was a female was not a woman at all.|$|E

25|$|Volapuk and Translit {{have been}} in use since <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> of <b>the</b> Internet to write e-mail {{messages}} and other texts in Russian where the support of Cyrillic fonts was limited: either the sender {{did not have a}} keyboard with Cyrillic letters or the receiver did not necessarily have Cyrillic screen fonts. In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days,</b> <b>the</b> situation was aggravated by a number of mutually incompatible computer encodings for the Cyrillic script, so that the sender and receiver were not guaranteed to have the same one. Also, the 7-bit character encoding of <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> was an additional hindrance.|$|R
5|$|Goaltenders {{have participated}} in the offence, albeit in a limited way, since <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> <b>days</b> of the sport. Before the {{creation}} of the NHL in 1917, there were some instances recorded of goaltenders rushing down the ice to participate in the play, occasionally scoring a goal. This practice has since been outlawed (goalies are not allowed to cross the centre red line to play the puck) after the Toronto Maple Leafs' Gary Smith was injured on such a rush in the 196667 NHL season. During the history of the league, there had been some near-misses by goaltenders, including attempts by Chuck Rayner by aiming at the empty net, or joining the attack. In 1977, Rogatien Vachon briefly became the first goaltender to score a goal after being credited following an own goal by the opponent, before it was given instead to a teammate by later video review.|$|E
