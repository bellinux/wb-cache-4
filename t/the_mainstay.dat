5|$|Today {{the main}} {{settlement}} {{on the island}} is Biggings, just {{to the east of}} which is Housa Voe from where the Snolda ferry arrives from its base at West Burrafirth on the Shetland Mainland. Crofting, especially sheep rearing, is <b>the</b> <b>mainstay</b> of island life.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak retired its {{fleet of}} F40PHs {{in the mid-1990s}} {{in favor of the}} GE Genesis, but the {{locomotive}} remains <b>the</b> <b>mainstay</b> of Via Rail's long-distance trains and is a common sight on many other commuter railroads throughout the United States. In addition, Amtrak has kept a number of de-engined F40PHs in use as Cabbage cars/Non-Powered Control Units.|$|E

5|$|From 1956 to 1976, the 102d was {{commanded}} by Brigadier General Charles W. Sweeney, pilot of the B-29 Superfortress Bockscar that dropped the Fat Man nuclear bomb on Nagasaki, Japan.

5|$|Hoodoo Gurus (referred {{to as the}} Gurus by fans) are an Australian rock band, {{formed in}} Sydney in 1981, by <b>the</b> <b>mainstay</b> Dave Faulkner (songwriter, lead singer and guitarist) and later joined by Richard Grossman (bass), Mark Kingsmill (drums), and Brad Shepherd (guitar, vocals, harmonica). Their {{popularity}} peaked {{in the mid to}} late 1980s with albums Mars Needs Guitars!, Blow Your Cool! and Magnum Cum Louder.|$|E
5|$|Samantha Claire Taylor MBE (born 25 September 1975) is {{a former}} cricketer who {{represented}} England more than 150 times between 1998 and 2011.

Along with Charlotte Edwards, she was <b>the</b> <b>mainstay</b> of England's batting during {{the first decade of the}} 21st century, and played a key role in the team's two world titles in 2009.|$|E

5|$|The {{first line}} therapy for aphthous {{stomatitis}} is topical agents rather than systemic medication, with topical corticosteroids being <b>the</b> <b>mainstay</b> treatment. Systemic treatment is {{usually reserved for}} severe disease due {{to the risk of}} adverse side effects associated with many of these agents. A systematic review found that no single systemic intervention was found to be effective. Good oral hygiene is important to prevent secondary infection of the ulcers.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mainstay</b> of the Ancient Greek diet was bread, {{and this}} was {{accompanied}} by goat's cheese, olives, figs, fish, and occasionally meat. The vegetables grown included onions, garlic, cabbages, melons, and lentils. In Ancient Rome, a thick porridge was made of emmer wheat or beans, accompanied by green vegetables but little meat, and fish was not esteemed. The Romans grew broad beans, peas, onions and turnips and ate the leaves of beets rather than their roots.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mainstay</b> of {{treatment}} is antipsychotic medication, along with counselling, {{job training and}} social rehabilitation. It is unclear whether typical or atypical antipsychotics are better. In {{those who do not}} improve with other antipsychotics clozapine may be tried. In more serious situations where there is risk to self or others involuntary hospitalization may be necessary, although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mainstay</b> of {{treatment}} is {{large quantities of}} intravenous fluids. Other treatments may include dialysis or hemofiltration in more severe cases. Once urine output is established sodium bicarbonate and mannitol are commonly used but they are poorly supported by the evidence. Outcomes are generally good if treated early. Complications may include high blood potassium, low blood calcium, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and compartment syndrome.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} cultivars of blackcurrant. 'Baldwin' was <b>the</b> <b>mainstay</b> of the {{industry}} for many years but it has now largely been superseded by more productive and disease-resistant varieties. During the 20th century in Europe, much hybridisation work {{has been carried out}} {{in order to reduce the}} plant's susceptibility to disease and frost and also to increase yields. This effort centred especially on Russia, Sweden and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Early Muslim {{writings}} {{confirm that}} the people of West Africa operated a sophisticated network of trade, usually under the authority of a monarch who levied taxes and provided bureaucratic and military support to his kingdom. Sophisticated mechanisms for the economic and political development of the involved African areas were in place before Islam further strengthened trade, towns and government in western Africa. The capital, court and trade of the region find mention in the works of scholar Abū 'Ubayd 'Abd Allāh al-Bakrī; <b>the</b> <b>mainstay</b> of the trans Saharan trade was gold and salt.|$|E

5|$|Groundwater {{is a very}} {{important}} resource in the Sava River basin, generally used for public water supply of potable water, as a source of water for industrial use, but also as <b>the</b> <b>mainstay</b> of aquatic ecosystems. There are 41 identified significant groundwater bodies in the Sava River basin of basin-wide importance, ranging in area size from , as well as numerous minor ground water bodies. Even though most of them are transboundary waters, eleven are considered to be largely located in Slovenia, fourteen in Croatia, seven in Bosnia-Herzegovina, five in Serbia and four in Montenegro.|$|E
5|$|Harvey was {{overlooked}} for Queensland {{selection for}} the whole 195253 season. He was recalled {{at the start of}} the 195354 campaign and made 26 and 20 in the first match against New South Wales, failing to convert his starts into big scores. He was retained despite making 15 and 0 in the next match against Victoria, but scored only 1 in the first innings of the match against South Australia starting on Christmas Day. Victoria were set 329 for victory, and having made only 62 runs in five innings for the season so far, he was <b>the</b> <b>mainstay</b> of the innings, scoring 102, but his team were all out for 245.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, the Air Force {{decided to}} close {{three of its}} nuclear weapons {{stations}} at its SAC bases. In addition to Loring, other bases around the world were scaled back. As the B-1B Lancer was now predicted to become <b>the</b> <b>mainstay</b> of nuclear defense for the country, Loring was deemed unnecessary for nuclear weapons stationing. That same year, fears began to surface that Loring would be an {{on the list of}} the 1988 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. As a result, the community began to rally around the base, which at the time included 3,800 military personnel, 1,000 civilian employees, generated an $80 million payroll the previous year, and was the subject of $34 million in construction services.|$|E

5|$|In the Shetland Islands, sand eels (Ammodytes marinus) {{normally}} form {{at least}} 90% {{of the food}} fed to chicks. It was found that, in years where the availability of sand eels was low, breeding success rates fell, with many chicks starving to death. In Norway it is the herring (Clupea harengus) that is <b>the</b> <b>mainstay</b> of the diet. When herring numbers dwindled, so did puffin numbers. In Labrador the puffins seemed more flexible and when the staple forage fish capelin (Mallotus villosus) declined in availability, {{they were able to}} adapt and feed the chicks on other prey species.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} of the delegates had trained as lawyers (several had even been judges), {{although}} only about a quarter had practiced law as their principal means of business. There were also merchants, manufacturers, shippers, land speculators, bankers or financiers, two or three physicians, a minister, and several small farmers. Of the twenty-five who owned slaves, sixteen depended on slave labor to run the plantations or other businesses that formed <b>the</b> <b>mainstay</b> of their income. Most of the delegates were landowners with substantial holdings, and most, {{with the possible exception of}} Roger Sherman and William Few, were very comfortably wealthy. George Washington and Robert Morris were among the wealthiest men in the entire country.|$|E
5|$|Once air-to-air combat began over North Vietnam, the Air Force {{was again}} found lacking. <b>The</b> <b>mainstay</b> {{missiles}} {{of the air}} war {{turned out to be}} the Navy-developed AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow, not its own AIM-4 Falcon. The Air Force continuously opposed adapting to the war in Southeast Asia, since its leadership believed that it was an aberration that would be quickly resolved. It could then turn its attention (and its more modern weapons) against the greater threat posed by the Soviet Union. None in the Air Force high command foresaw that the war would drag on for nearly a decade.|$|E
