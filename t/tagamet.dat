25|$|Joseph {{provided}} {{well for}} their family, {{but he was}} unfaithful. His affairs included one with Gloria Swanson. When Rose was eight months pregnant with the couple's fourth child, Kathleen, she temporarily {{went back to her}} parents, returning to Joseph after her father told her divorce was not an option. In turning a blind eye to her husband's affairs, Rose depended heavily on medication. Ronald Kessler found records for prescription tranquilizers Seconal, Placidyl, Librium, and Dalmane to relieve Rose's nervousness and stress, and Lomotil, Bentyl, Librax, and <b>Tagamet</b> for her stomach.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine {{was first}} marketed in the United Kingdom in 1976, {{and in the}} U.S. in August 1977; therefore, it took 12 years from {{initiation}} of the H2 receptor antagonist program to commercialization. By 1979, <b>Tagamet</b> was being sold in more than 100 countries and became the top-selling prescription product in the U.S., Canada, and several other countries. In November 1997, the American Chemical Society and the Royal Society of Chemistry in the U.K. jointly recognized the work as a milestone in drug discovery by designating it an International Historic Chemical Landmark during a ceremony at SmithKline Beecham's New Frontiers Science Park research facilities in Harlow, England.|$|E
25|$|H2-receptor antagonists: include {{cimetidine}} (<b>Tagamet),</b> famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid), and ranitidine (Zantac). Reduced secretion of {{gastric acid}} and pepsin produced by H2 blockers can reduce absorption of protein-bound (dietary) vitamin B12, {{but not of}} supplemental vitamin B12. Gastric acid is needed to release vitamin B12 from protein for absorption. Clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency and megaloblastic anemia are unlikely, unless H2 blocker therapy is prolonged (2 years or more), or the person's diet is poor. It is also more likely {{if the person is}} rendered achlorhydric(with complete absence of gastric acid secretion), which occurs more frequently with proton pump inhibitors than H2 blockers. Vitamin B12 levels should be monitored in people taking high doses of H2 blockers for prolonged periods.|$|E

50|$|Galactorrhea {{is also a}} {{side effect}} {{associated}} with the use of the second-generation H2 receptor antagonist cimetidine (<b>Tagamet).</b> Galactorrhea can also be caused by antipsychotics that cause hyperprolactinemia by blocking dopamine receptors responsible for control of prolactin release. Of these, risperidone is the most notorious for causing this complication. Case reports suggest proton-pump inhibitors have been shown to cause galactorrhea.|$|E
50|$|Smith, Kline & French {{discovered}} <b>Tagamet</b> (Cimetidine) at The Frythe in 1971, which treats peptic ulcers by Sir James Black FRS and C. Robin Ganellin FRS {{with research}} on H2 antagonist. The Frythe site was closed by GlaxoSmithKline {{and sold to}} a property development company on 19 December 2010. The site is now standing empty while planning permission for houses is being applied for.|$|E
50|$|By the 1980s, after 25 {{years of}} working as a hitman for the mafia, Kuklinski started his own crime ring, and devised new ways to profit from killing people. The case of {{pharmacist}} Paul Hoffman was typical of Kuklinski's methodology. Hoffman hoped to make a large profit by illegally purchasing large quantities of <b>Tagamet,</b> a popular drug used to treat peptic ulcers, at low cost to resell through his pharmacy.|$|E
5000|$|Smith Kline & French {{launched}} it as {{a single}} agent under the brand Dyrenium in 1964. The combination drug with hydrochlorothiazidem, Dyazide, was first approved in the US in 1965 and the first generic, brought by Bolar Pharmaceutical Co., was approved in 1987. [...] In 1986 Dyazide was the most prescribed drug in the US and had $325 million in sales, making it SmithKline Beckman's second-biggest seller behind <b>Tagamet.</b>|$|E
50|$|The prototypical H2 antagonist, called cimetidine, was {{developed}} by Sir James Black at Smith, Kline & French (now GlaxoSmithKline) in the mid-to-late 1960s. It was first marketed in 1976 and sold under the trade name <b>Tagamet,</b> which became the first blockbuster drug. The use of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) {{led to the development}} of other agents—starting with ranitidine, first sold as Zantac, which has fewer adverse effects and drug interactions and is more potent.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time, Black was {{developing}} a similar method of inventing drugs {{for treatment of}} stomach ulcers, but ICI {{did not wish to}} pursue the idea so Black resigned in 1964 and joined Smith, Kline and French where he worked for nine years until 1973. While there, Black developed his second major drug, cimetidine, which was launched under the brand name <b>Tagamet</b> in 1975 and soon outsold propranolol to become the world's largest-selling prescription drug.|$|E
50|$|Hydroxychloroquine {{generally}} {{does not}} have significant interactions with other medications, but care should be taken if combined with medication altering liver function as well as aurothioglucose (Solganal), cimetidine (<b>Tagamet)</b> or digoxin (Lanoxin). HCQ can increase plasma concentrations of penicillamine which {{may contribute to the}} development of severe side effects. It enhances hypoglycemic effects of insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents. Dose altering is recommended to prevent profound hypoglycemia. Antacids may decrease the absorption of HCQ. Both neostigmine and pyridostigmine antagonize the action of hydroxychloroquine.|$|E

50|$|At the Bourn Hall Clinic in Bourn, west of Cambridge, {{in vitro}} {{fertilisation}} (IVF) was first achieved in 1978. Smith, Kline and French developed <b>Tagamet</b> in the 1970s at the Frythe, north of Welwyn; the site was sold by GSK in December 2010, and in World War II was home to Station IX, which made sabotage equipment for secret agents. <b>Tagamet</b> was for many years the world's best-selling prescription drug - for stomach ulcers; the team had been led by C. Robin Ganellin, Graham Durant and John Emmett. In 1912 in Cambridge Frederick Gowland Hopkins discovered vitamins, gaining the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1929. Under Sir David Jack, Allen & Hanburys at Ware (part of Glaxo Group Research since 1958, next to Chauncy School) developed Ventolin (for asthma) in the late 1960s and Zantac (for peptic ulcers) in the late 1970s; Zantac was the first pharmaceutical to sell more than $1bn per year; more recently Seretid (also for asthma) was developed there and the site {{is now part of}} GSK, which has a separate manufacturing site there. In 1975 at Cambridge César Milstein and Georges J. F. Köhler separated monoclonal antibodies at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, and gained the 1984 Nobel Prize for Medicine; the MRC LMB has had many Nobel prizes for Medicine. Adalimumab, known as Humira, the world's best-selling drug, was partly developed in Cambridge by Cambridge Antibody Technology. Smith & Nephew Research was based at Gilston Park House, in Gilston, north of Harlow.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, in a $660-million deal, Prestige Brands Holdings {{took over}} 17 GSK brands {{with sales of}} $210 million, {{including}} BC Powder, Beano, Ecotrin, Fiber Choice, Goody's Powder, Sominex and <b>Tagamet.</b> In 2012 the company {{announced that it would}} invest £500 million in manufacturing facilities in Ulverston, northern England, designating it as the site for a previously announced biotech plant. In May that year it acquired CellZome, a German biotech company, for US$98 million, and in June worldwide rights to alitretinoin (Toctino), an eczema drug, for $302 million. In 2013 GSK acquired Human Genome Sciences (HGS) for $3 billion; the companies had collaborated on developing the lupus drug Belimumab (Benlysta), albiglutide for type 2 diabetes, and darapladib for atherosclerosis.|$|E
5000|$|Such {{persons have}} {{impaired}} acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which causes acetaldehyde levels to peak higher, producing more severe hangovers and other effects such as flushing and tachycardia. Conversely, members of certain ethnicities that traditionally {{did not use}} alcoholic beverages have lower levels of alcohol dehydrogenases and thus [...] "sober up" [...] very slowly, but reach lower aldehyde concentrations and have milder hangovers. Rate of detoxification of alcohol can also be slowed by certain drugs which interfere with the action of alcohol dehydrogenases, notably aspirin, furfural (which {{may be found in}} fusel alcohol), fumes of certain solvents, many heavy metals, and some pyrazole compounds. Also suspected of having this effect are cimetidine (<b>Tagamet),</b> ranitidine (Zantac), and acetaminophen (Tylenol) (paracetamol).|$|E

50|$|As {{aromatic}} compounds {{have been}} exhausted {{to a large}} extent as building blocks for life science products, N-heterocyclic structures prevail nowadays. They are found in many natural products, such as chlorophyll; hemoglobin; and the vitamins biotin, folic acid, niacin (PP), pyridoxine (vitamin B6), riboflavin (vitamin B2), and thiamine (vitamin B1). In synthetic life science products, N-heterocyclic moieties are widely diffuses both pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Thus, β-lactams are structural elements of penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics, imidazoles are found both in modern herbicides, e.g. Arsenal (imazapyr) and pharmaceuticals, e.g. the antiulcerants <b>Tagamet</b> (cimetidine. see above) and Nexium (omeprazole), the antimycotics Daktarin (miconazole), Fungarest (ketoconazole) and Travogen (isoconazole). Tetrazoles and tetrazolidines are pivotal parts of the “sartan” class of hypertensives, e.g. Candesartan cilexetil (candesartan), Avapro (irbesartan), Cozaar (losartan) and Diovan (valsartan).|$|E
50|$|In 1958, {{shortly after}} his PhD studies at Queen Mary College, Ganellin joined Smith Kline and French Laboratories in the UK where he began {{research}} in medicinal chemistry. Two years after starting at SK&F, {{he went to the}} Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he performed his postdoctoral work with Arthur C. Cope. At MIT he devised the first direct optical resolution of a chiral olefin using platinum complex chemistry. After a year at MIT, he returned to the United Kingdom to resume his work at SK&F. In 1966 he headed a landmark research team at SK&F, collaborating with Sir James Black researching histamine H2-receptor antagonists. This research eventually led to the discovery of cimetidine, also known by its trademark name <b>Tagamet</b> which is currently produced by GlaxoSmith Kline.|$|E
50|$|Ranitidine {{was first}} {{prepared}} as AH19065 by John Bradshaw {{in the summer}} of 1977 in the Ware research laboratories of Allen & Hanburys Ltd, part of the Glaxo organization. Its development was a response to the first in class histamine H2 receptor antagonist, cimetidine, developed by Sir James Black at Smith, Kline and French, and launched in the United Kingdom as <b>Tagamet</b> in November 1976. Both companies would eventually become merged as GlaxoSmithKline following a sequence of mergers and acquisitions starting with the integration of Allen & Hanbury's Ltd and Glaxo to form Glaxo Group Research in 1979, and ultimately with the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham in 2000. Ranitidine {{was the result of a}} rational drug-design process using what was by then a fairly refined model of the histamine H2 receptor and quantitative structure-activity relationships.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{drugs are}} often used to help analgesics combat various types of pain, {{and parts of the}} overall pain experience, and are hence called {{adjuvant}} medications. Gabapentin - an anti-epileptic - not only exerts effects alone on neuropathic pain, but can potentiate opiates. [...] While perhaps not prescribed as such, other drugs such as <b>Tagamet</b> (cimetidine) and even simple grapefruit juice may also potentiate opiates, by inhibiting CYP450 enzymes in the liver, thereby slowing metabolism of the drug. In addition, orphenadrine, cyclobenzaprine, trazodone and other drugs with anticholinergic properties are useful in conjunction with opioids for neuropathic pain. Orphenadrine and cyclobenzaprine are also muscle relaxants, and therefore particularly useful in painful musculoskeletal conditions. Clonidine has found use as an analgesic for this same purpose, and all of the mentioned drugs potentiate the effects of opioids overall.|$|E
50|$|The {{roots of}} both the term “fine chemicals” and the {{emergence}} of the fine chemical industry as a distinct entity date back to the late 1970s, when the overwhelming success of the histamine H2 receptor antagonists <b>Tagamet</b> (cimetidine) and Zantac (ranitidine hydrochloride) created a strong demand for advanced organic chemicals used in their manufacturing processes. As the in-house production capacities of the originators, the pharmaceutical companies Smith, Kline & French and Glaxo, could not keep pace with the rapidly increasing requirements, both companies (now merged as GlaxoSmithKline) outsourced part of the manufacturing to chemical companies experienced in producing relatively sophisticated organic molecules. Lonza, Switzerland, which already had supplied an early intermediate, methyl acetoacetate, during drug development, soon became the main supplier of more and more advanced precursors. The signature of a first, simple supply contract is generally acknowledged as the historical document marking the beginning of the fine chemical industry.|$|E
