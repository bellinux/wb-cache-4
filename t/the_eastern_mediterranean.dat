5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Waldeck-Rousseau joined the main French fleet that blockaded {{the southern end of}} the Adriatic to prevent the Austro-Hungarian Navy from operating in the Mediterranean. In October and November, Waldeck-Rousseau was twice attacked by Austro-Hungarian U-boats but she escaped unscathed in both engagements.

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Mediterranean,</b> the decoy {{operation}} MG 3 {{had begun}} when convoy MW12 with three freighters had sailed from Port Said after dusk on 10 August. The merchant ships were escorted by two cruisers, ten destroyers and two smaller escorts and another merchant ship escorted by two cruisers and three destroyers left Haifa at 03:00 the next day. The two forces rendezvoused early on 11 August and sailed {{west to the}} longitude of Alexandria, then turned back. U-83 had reported that four cruisers and ten destroyers were close to Crete and a message from a Sunderland was intercepted. Reconnaissance reports from Malta noted a smokescreen over Valletta, apparently to conceal two cruisers but this was later taken to mean that the British were hiding the departure of ships heading west towards the convoy. The large size of the convoy was interpreted by Supermarina to imply an operation in <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> and prepared to reinforce the 8th Cruiser Division at Navarino.|$|E
5|$|Ottoman cuisine {{has given}} rise to the cuisines of modern Turkey, parts of the Balkans, Cyprus, and Greece. A {{distinctive}} element is the family of small flaky pastries called börek. These are popular and widespread across <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> region, and date as far back as ancient Roman times. Börek are made of thin sheets of filo pastry, filled with mixtures such as meat, caramelised onion and sweet peppers.|$|E
5|$|The 13th century saw popular {{outbursts of}} ecstatic piety {{in support of}} the Crusades such as that {{resulting}} in the Children's Crusade in 1212.

5|$|The Kingdom of Jerusalem was {{the first}} {{experiment}} in European colonialism creating a 'Europe Overseas' or Outremer. The raising, transportation, and supply of large armies led to flourishing trade between Europe and the outremer. The Italian city states of Genoa and Venice flourished, creating profitable trading colonies in <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Mediterranean.</b> This trade was sustained through the middle Byzantine and Ottoman eras, and the communities were often assimilated and known as Levantines or Franco-Levantines.|$|E
5|$|The Roman army {{succeeded in}} conquering many territories {{covering}} the entire Mediterranean region and coastal regions in southwestern Europe and north Africa. These territories were {{home to many}} different cultural groups, both urban populations and rural populations. Generally speaking, <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> provinces were more urbanised than the western, having previously been united under the Macedonian Empire and Hellenised by the influence of Greek culture.|$|E
5|$|After the First Crusade's {{capture of}} Jerusalem and victory at Ascalon the {{majority}} of the Crusaders considered their pilgrimage complete and returned to Europe. Godfrey was left with only 300 knights and 2,000 infantry to defend the territory won in <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Mediterranean.</b> Only Tancred of the crusader princes remained with the aim of establishing his own lordship. At this point the Franks held only Jerusalem and two great Syrian cities; Antioch and Edessa but not the surrounding country. Jerusalem remained economically sterile despite the advantages of being the centre of administration of church and state and benefitting from streams of pilgrims.|$|E

Edgar Quinet meanwhile remained in the Mediterranean during the Greco-Turkish War, and during the Great Fire of Smyrna, at the climax of the conflict, she rescued 1,200 people from the city.|$|E
5|$|All four ships {{served in}} the 1st Division of the Italian fleet during the Italo-Turkish War, and were the workhorses of the {{operations}} off North Africa and in <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Mediterranean.</b> During World War I, the ships were primarily based in Brindisi, Taranto, and Valona; they saw no action during the war due to the cautious fleet policies adopted by both the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies. The ships remained in the Italian fleet {{for a few years}} after the war, but all were discarded and broken up for scrap by 1927.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} blackmouth {{catshark}} (Galeus melastomus) and the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), the velvet belly {{is one of}} the most abundant deep-sea sharks in the northeastern Atlantic. It is found individually or in small shoals. Samplings in the Mediterranean have found females outnumbering males across all ages; this imbalance increases in the older age classes. In the Rockall Trough and the Catalan Sea, large adults are found in deeper waters than juveniles, which may serve to reduce competition between the two groups. However, this pattern has not been observed at other sites in <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Mediterranean.</b>|$|E
