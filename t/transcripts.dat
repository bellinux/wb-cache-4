5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the RITS complex induces heterochromatin formation and organization is not well understood. Most {{studies have focused on}} the mating-type region in fission yeast, which may not be representative of activities in other genomic regions/organisms. In maintenance of existing heterochromatin regions, RITS forms a complex with siRNAs complementary to the local genes and stably binds local methylated histones, acting co-transcriptionally to degrade any nascent pre-mRNA <b>transcripts</b> that are initiated by RNA polymerase. The formation of such a heterochromatin region, though not its maintenance, is dicer-dependent, presumably because dicer is required to generate the initial complement of siRNAs that target subsequent <b>transcripts.</b> Heterochromatin maintenance has been suggested to function as a self-reinforcing feedback loop, as new siRNAs are formed from the occasional nascent <b>transcripts</b> by RdRP for incorporation into local RITS complexes. The relevance of observations from fission yeast mating-type regions and centromeres to mammals is not clear, as heterochromatin maintenance in mammalian cells may be independent of the components of the RNAi pathway.|$|E

40|$|During <b>transcript</b> {{elongation}} in vitro, backtracking of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is {{a frequent}} occurrence {{that can lead to}} transcriptional arrest. The polymerase active site can cleave the <b>transcript</b> during such backtracking, allowing transcription to resume. <b>Transcript</b> cleavage is either stimulated by elongation factor TFIIS or occurs much more slowly in its absence. However, whether backtracking actually occurs in vivo, and whether <b>transcript</b> cleavage is important to escape it, has been unclear. Using a yeast TFIIS mutant that lacks <b>transcript</b> cleavage stimulatory activity and simultaneously inhibits unstimulated cleavage, we now provide evidence that escape from backtracking via <b>transcript</b> cleavage is essential for cell viability and efficient <b>transcript</b> elongation. Our results suggest that transcription problems leading to backtracking are frequent in vivo and that reactivation of backtracked RNAPII is crucial for transcription...|$|R

5|$|In prokaryotes, {{transcription}} {{occurs in}} the cytoplasm; for very long <b>transcripts,</b> translation may begin at the 5'end of the RNA while the 3'end is still being transcribed.

One of the modifications performed is the splicing of introns which are sequences in the transcribed region that do not encode protein. Alternative splicing mechanisms can result in mature <b>transcripts</b> from the same gene having different sequences and thus coding for different proteins. This is a major form of regulation in eukaryotic cells and also occurs in some prokaryotes.|$|E
