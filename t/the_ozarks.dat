5|$|Atmospheric {{conditions}} remained {{only marginally}} conducive {{for the development}} of thunderstorms on the morning of December30. Throughout the day, moisture was drawn from the Gulf of Mexico northward into <b>the</b> <b>Ozarks</b> region. However, the presence of a capping inversion prevented thunderstorms from developing. During the evening of December30, an area of strong wind shear developed near the Ark-La-Tex and southeastern Oklahoma area well ahead of a nearing cold front, providing a focal point for potential storm development. Late that day, scattered thunderstorms developed over eastern Oklahoma and northern Arkansas, producing significant hail. Over the next few hours and into December31, these storms would intensify as they moved into southwestern Missouri, producing four tornadoes. The first tornado watch issued in association with the severe event was issued at 07:06UTC on December31 as these storms tracked across <b>the</b> <b>Ozarks.</b> After a few hours, these supercell thunderstorms lessened in strength as they neared the Greater St. Louis metropolitan area.|$|E

5|$|Asplenium bradleyi, {{commonly}} known as Bradley's spleenwort or cliff spleenwort, is a rare epipetric fern of east-central North America. Named after Professor Frank Howe Bradley, who first collected it in Tennessee, it may be found infrequently {{throughout much of the}} Appalachian Mountains, <b>the</b> <b>Ozarks,</b> and the Ouachita Mountains, growing in small crevices on exposed sandstone cliffs. The species originated as a hybrid between mountain spleenwort (Asplenium montanum) and ebony spleenwort (Asplenium platyneuron); A.bradleyi originated when that sterile diploid hybrid underwent chromosome doubling to become a fertile tetraploid, a phenomenon known as allopolyploidy. Studies indicate that the present population of Bradley's spleenwort arose from several independent doublings of sterile diploid hybrids. A.bradleyi can also form sterile hybrids with several other spleenworts.|$|E

5|$|During the {{afternoon}} hours of February10, 2009, a strong, {{middle and upper}} storm system moved across the Four Corners region into the central and southern Great Plains. A moist, low-level air mass streamed northward across Texas and Louisiana into eastern Oklahoma and <b>the</b> <b>Ozarks</b> ahead of the system. Daytime heating of the moistening boundary layer increased throughout {{the afternoon}} across Oklahoma and Texas as cloud cover shifted eastward. Cooling aloft, {{in conjunction with the}} approaching storm system, led to atmospheric instability, resulting in thunderstorms. A very strong wind field increased with height through the lower troposphere, resulting in a wind shear favorable for rotation in the thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|The city {{generally}} slopes {{from the}} highest point in the Northeast to the lowest point in the Southwest towards the Missouri River.

Along these and other creeks in the area can be found large valleys, cliffs, and cave systems such as that in Rock Bridge State Park {{just south of the}} city. These creeks are largely responsible for numerous stream valleys giving Columbia hilly terrain similar to <b>the</b> <b>Ozarks</b> while also having prairie flatland typical of northern Missouri. Columbia also operates several greenbelts with trails and parks throughout town.|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} of her purchaser is not known, nor are her activities after her sale, but Ozark {{was still in}} service in late 1873 and based at New Orleans. Louisiana governor William Pitt Kellogg used the ship to transport 35 soldiers of the 19th Infantry Regiment and 25 mounted members of the New Orleans Metropolitan Police to Colfax, Louisiana in October to apprehend the perpetrators of the Colfax Massacre. Due to widespread resistance by local whites, only a few men were arrested and transported to New Orleans by Ozark to stand trial in December. Prosecution witnesses were transported and housed in the ship during the trials in February–March 1874 {{to protect them from}} threats made by white supremacists.

5|$|The Storm Prediction Center(SPC) {{began to}} note the {{possibility}} that a severe weather event could develop on December30 as early as December25, 2010. Nonetheless, the predictability of the event was too low as the event was several days out. As the anticipated event grew closer, confidence in the forecast slowly increased, though uncertainties in the timing and extent of the tornado outbreak still existed. These uncertainties remained through December29 with forecasts calling for only marginal hail and possibly damaging gusts. However, the SPC indicated that supercells and more severe weather could result from atmospheric conditions deviating slightly from the forecast. In contrast, forecasts were more confident in a widespread outbreak of severe weather for New Year's Eve; the SPC issued a slight risk outlook for much of the Lower Mississippi Valley and <b>the</b> <b>Ozarks</b> as a result.|$|E
5|$|The United States Storm Prediction Center first noted a {{possible}} New Year's Eve severe weather event {{as early as}} December25, 2010. These forecasts gained confidence as the event approached, {{with a focus on}} <b>the</b> <b>Ozarks</b> and adjacent areas. Supercells developed in this area during the night of December30 and tracked across central Missouri, producing several tornadoes and large hail. However, the bulk of activity during the outbreak was a result of a long line of supercells that tracked from Oklahoma to Illinois, producing five EF3tornadoes. One of these tracked through northwestern Arkansas, killing four. Another tore through eastern sections of Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri, destroying 159homes and causing US$90million in damage, making it the costliest tornado of the outbreak. A separate cluster of storms later developed in Louisiana before tracking into Mississippi, producing several tornadoes across southern and central regions of the state on January1.|$|E

5|$|The {{catalyst}} for the severe weather outbreak came as a positively-tilted shortwave trough progressed across the central High Plains into the Great Plains and eventually through the western Great Lakes region. A weaker disturbance pushed from <b>the</b> <b>Ozarks</b> into the Northeastern United States, acting to strengthen southwesterly winds aloft across the risk area. At the surface, a weak {{area of low pressure}} initially centered over northeastern Kansas early on April9 progressed steadily northeast while intensifying, reaching the trisection of Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois by late that evening. A cold front stemming from the low progressed eastward across the Mid-South, whereas an arching warm front slowly pushed northward across eastern Iowa and northern Illinois. Modest surface heating ahead of the cold front allowed mid-level Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values to reach 1,000–1,500 J/kg, and a mass of rich moisture transported northward from the Gulf of Mexico pushed dewpoints into the lower 60s °F across the Enhanced risk area. Winds at 850 mb (4,781ft) strengthened at or above 45mph (75km/h) below winds of 70mph (110km/h) at 700 mb (9,882ft), creating a favorable setup for sustained supercells. Although the overall directional component of low-level winds was expected to be less than ideal as a whole, a small area of southeasterly surface winds developed near the surface low in northern Illinois.|$|E
