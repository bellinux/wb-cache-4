5|$|The role of {{the main}} {{caregiver}} is often taken by <b>the</b> <b>spouse</b> or a close relative.

Despite her complete unsuitability, the prince was determined to marry her. This was in spite of the Act of Settlement 1701, which barred <b>the</b> <b>spouse</b> of a Catholic from succeeding to the throne, and the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which prohibited his marriage without the King's consent, which would never have been granted.|$|E
5|$|Civil partnerships, {{introduced}} by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar, but not equal to, those of civil marriage. The ability {{to enter into a}} civil partnership ended on 16 November 2015. Constitutional protections granted to spouses, such as <b>the</b> <b>spouse</b> of a witness not being compelled to give evidence against their spouse in most cases, is one example of protections granted under civil partnerships. Spouses may further claim privilege in so far as necessary to protect the constitutional right to marital privacy. No such constitutional protections exist for civil partnerships. Further inequalities in relation to the family, immigration and other types of Irish law exist. The legislation provides rights for participants in long-term cohabiting relationships (opposite- or same-sex) who have not entered into a civil partnership or marriage. The following entry focuses primarily on the same-sex civil partnership aspect of the Act, as opposed to the cohabitation aspect.|$|E
5|$|The {{layout of}} Ambohimanga's three {{compounds}} and the structures within them followed a traditional design {{established by the}} earliest Merina highland settlers by the 15th century. According to custom, a rova could only be established by an andriana (noble). Its foundation was built to raise the rova higher than the surrounding buildings outside its walls. Contained within the rova {{was at least one}} lapa (royal palace or residence) as well as the fasana (tomb) of {{one or more of the}} site's founders and family members. It also enclosed a kianja (courtyard) marked by a vatomasina (sacred stone) that elevated the sovereign above the people for the delivery of kabary (royal speeches or decrees). The sovereign's lodgings typically stood in the northern part of the rova, while <b>the</b> <b>spouse</b> or spouses lived in the southern part.|$|E
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} called the {{community}} property of <b>the</b> <b>spouses</b> regulating property relations between spouses. It is divided into seven chapters, the first chapter is an introduction and the last conclusion. It discusses {{the historical development of}} the law, since the Roman law to the current legislation. Another chapter is devoted to defining the concept of community property of <b>the</b> <b>spouses,</b> its origin and content, including its use and administration. The following describes the modification of community property of <b>the</b> <b>spouses</b> and is worked out in detail his demise and settlement. The fourth chapter is devoted to legislation enshrined in the New Civil Code, which becomes effective on January 1, 2014. Finally, it describes the bond of community property of <b>the</b> <b>spouses</b> to private international law and a comparison of the arrangements of community property of <b>the</b> <b>spouses</b> in selected European countries...|$|R

This can be offset by <b>the</b> fact that <b>spouses</b> may enter into a transmutation agreement at any time, during marriage. Accordingly, while <b>the</b> <b>spouses</b> are working or practicing their profession (and they are exposed to risks) they can enter into a transmutation agreement and transfer certain assets to <b>the</b> low-risk <b>spouse.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>spouses</b> retire and risks dissipate, <b>the</b> <b>spouses</b> can enter into another transmutation agreement and convert their separate property back to community, regaining the full step up.|$|R
5|$|The rova's {{earliest}} defining features had crystallised {{among the}} Merina as residences for local rulers at least 100 {{years before the}} emergence of the united Kingdom of Imerina under Andriamanelo. According to custom, a rova's foundation was always elevated relative to the surrounding village. The compound also always featured a kianja (central courtyard) marked by a vatomasina (tall sacred stone) where the sovereign would stand to deliver kabary (royal speeches or decrees). Contained within the rova was at least one lapa (royal palace or residence) as well as the fasana (tomb) of {{one or more of the}} site's founders. The sovereign's lodgings typically stood in the northern part of the rova, while <b>the</b> <b>spouse</b> or spouses lived in the southern part. It was not until the dawn of the 19th century that a perimeter wall of sharpened wooden stakes would constitute another defining feature of rova construction.|$|E
5|$|The Reich Film Chamber, {{which all}} members of the film {{industry}} were required to join, was created in June 1933. Goebbels promoted the development of films with a Nazi slant, and ones that contained subliminal or overt propaganda messages. Under the auspices of the Reichskulturkammer (Reich Chamber of Culture), created in September, Goebbels added additional sub-chambers for the fields of broadcasting, fine arts, literature, music, the press, and the theatre. As in the film industry, anyone wishing to pursue a career in these fields had {{to be a member of}} the corresponding chamber. In this way anyone whose views were contrary to the regime could be excluded from working in their chosen field and thus silenced. In addition, journalists (now considered employees of the state) were required to prove Aryan descent back to the year 1800, and if married, the same requirement applied to <b>the</b> <b>spouse.</b> Members of any chamber were not allowed to leave the country for their work without prior permission of their chamber. A committee was established to censor books, and works could not be re-published unless they were on the list of approved works. Similar regulations applied to other fine arts and entertainment; even cabaret performances were censored. Many German artists and intellectuals left Germany in the pre-war years rather than work under these restrictions.|$|E

30|$|We are able, in {{our data}} source, to {{distinguish}} {{whether or not}} a wedding has been celebrated with the religious rite, but, unfortunately, we are unable to distinguish the religious faith to which <b>the</b> <b>spouses</b> belong. This effect may be, in part, <b>the</b> result of <b>spouses</b> coming from another country and other religious traditions. Indeed, when one of <b>the</b> <b>spouses</b> is not Italian, the probability of observing a marriage during Lent increases. A possible explanation for this is that when one of <b>the</b> <b>spouses</b> is not Italian, the weight of the cultural traditions of <b>the</b> other <b>spouse</b> is eased. This would be either because one of <b>the</b> <b>spouses</b> is not Catholic or because he or she comes from a Catholic country where the Lent prescription was not enforced. If this interpretation is corrected, it may seem surprising {{that there is not a}} statistical significant difference between couples in which <b>the</b> <b>spouses</b> are Italian or where neither are Italian. However, in Table  4, we show that when neither spouses are Italian, they are very unlikely to marry with the religious rite. Therefore, the results are probably influenced by the extreme rareness of the event.|$|R
