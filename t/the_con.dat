5|$|Even though Lanley {{succeeds in}} winning over {{almost the entire}} town, his salesmanship fails to {{convince}} Marge, who is frustrated with the town's purchase because she (correctly) believes the monorail is unsafe and that Lanley is a conman. While watching TV, Homer sees an advertisement that suggests he attend Lanley's institute of monorail conducting, which is a transparent effort to make even more money from <b>the</b> <b>con.</b> Homer immediately decides to enroll. After a three-week course, Lanley selects Homer at random from among his classmates to be the monorail conductor.|$|E
5|$|Having {{believed}} {{that they would be}} participating in Russian's television programme for an entire year, most contestants had given up their homes, jobs and partners—most had to find new employment and some were forced to move in with their parents. Russian went into hiding and was unable to be reached by his victims. On 13 June 2002, Debbie Leigh Driver, one of Russian's contestants, contacted Caz Gorham and Frances Dickenson of the independent production company Christmas TV & Film and told them about the hoax. Gorham and Dickenson produced a genuine TV programme to document the story of <b>the</b> <b>con</b> and how the participants were now trying to get their lives back together, which was shown on Channel 4 in December 2002.|$|E

500|$|The turret {{faces were}} [...] thick while their sides were {{probably}} [...] in thickness, and {{the roof was}} 8inches thick. The armour of the barbettes and <b>the</b> <b>conning</b> tower was 15inches thick and <b>the</b> <b>conning</b> tower's communications tube to the upper deck was 8inches thick. The fire-control director atop <b>the</b> <b>conning</b> tower was protected by an armoured hood 4 to 6inches thick.|$|R
50|$|Type 039A: Original Yuan class. The {{most obvious}} {{external}} visual difference between Type 039A and its predecessor Type 039/039G Song class submarine is in <b>the</b> <b>conning</b> tower. <b>The</b> <b>conning</b> tower of Type 039A {{is similar to}} that of Type 039G, but the tower lacks the fin-shaped extrusion on the rear section of <b>the</b> <b>conning</b> towers of both the Type 039 and the Type 039G.|$|R
5|$|Homer and Marge, on the {{way back}} from an {{orchestra}} performance, pass through a seedy part of town. Marge cautions Homer, but gets enticed by Snake's Three-card Monte game. Snake cheats Homer out of $20, but Marge exposes <b>the</b> <b>con</b> and Snake takes off. After giving chase, Marge knocks Snake unconscious with a garbage can lid, giving her a sense of exhilaration. Finding her everyday routine dull and boring, she decides to join the Springfield police force, despite Homer's concerns.|$|E
5|$|Peckinpah {{originally}} wanted actor Jack Palance to {{play the}} role of Rudy Butler but could not afford his salary. Impressed by his performance in The Panic in Needle Park (1971), Hill recommended Richard Bright. Bright had worked with McQueen fourteen years before, but he did not have the threatening physique that McQueen pictured for Butler because the two men were the same height. Due to his friendship with Bright, Peckinpah cast him as <b>the</b> <b>con</b> man. Al Lettieri was brought to Peckinpah's attention for the role of Butler by producer Albert S. Ruddy, who was working with the actor on The Godfather (1972). Like Peckinpah, Lettieri was a heavy drinker, which caused problems while filming due to his unpredictable behavior.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer is in {{bed with}} a young woman, Jessica (Kristin Richardson). After he {{declares}} his love for her, she realizes he is late for a meeting. As he rushes to leave, his briefcase falls open, revealing thousands of dollars in cash he claims she was not supposed to have seen. Sawyer then informs her that he is meeting someone to get money for an investment that will triple his cash in two weeks, and Jessica tells him that she will get additional money from her husband, David (Michael DeLuise), so that she and Sawyer can split the profit. Later, Sawyer is revealed to be a con artist in debt with a loan shark, Kilo (Billy Mayo), who demands his money back, plus fifty percent, by the next day. Sawyer goes to Jessica's house to finalize the deal, but reconsiders upon seeing a small boy (Jim Woitas) emerge from another room. He suddenly calls off <b>the</b> <b>con,</b> drops his briefcase of money, and rushes out of their house.|$|E
50|$|The turret {{faces were}} 18 in thick while their sides were {{probably}} 14 in in thickness, and {{the roof was}} 8 inches thick. The armour of the barbettes and <b>the</b> <b>conning</b> tower was 15 inches thick and <b>the</b> <b>conning</b> tower's communications tube to the upper deck was 8 inches thick.

25|$|In series 5, {{the team}} conned Harry Fielding and Carlton Wood, two obnoxious businessmen, out of £500,000. The two {{returned}} to con back the gang {{in the series}} 5 finale. However Mickey and the crew knew Harry and Carlton's plan and turned <b>the</b> <b>con</b> on them.|$|E
500|$|The main {{guns were}} {{controlled}} from <b>the</b> <b>conning</b> tower. Data from a [...] Argo rangefinder located {{on top of}} <b>the</b> <b>conning</b> tower was input into a Mk I Dreyer Fire-Control Table located in the transmitting station (TS) below <b>the</b> <b>conning</b> tower where it was converted into range and deflection data {{for use by the}} guns. The target's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. 'B' and 'X' turrets were provided with nine-foot rangefinders and were fitted as secondary control positions.|$|R
50|$|When Brown {{was asked}} what {{conditions}} were like below, he replied:The lights were out — the First Lieutenant had a torch flashlight. The water was not very high but rising gradually all the time. When I came up the last time it was about two feet deep. There was a hole just forward of <b>the</b> <b>conning</b> tower through which water was pouring. As I went down through <b>the</b> <b>conning</b> tower compartment I felt it pouring down my back. Water was also coming in where plates were stove-in {{on either side of}} <b>the</b> <b>conning</b> tower.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the main gunnery directors, a stereoscopic OPL 5-meter tactical rangefinder (to {{be used by the}} flag staff) was located atop <b>the</b> <b>conning</b> tower of Dunkerque. On Strasbourg, it was located atop the fore tower, and the silhouette slightly different, as it integrated <b>the</b> <b>conning</b> tower and <b>the</b> bridge installations.|$|R
25|$|By the 1950s, Smith {{had become}} {{sort of a}} Robin Hood figure, who took from the miners and gave to the poor widows, orphans, dogs, and criminals who lived by their wits. Smith, the antihero, was a loyal friend who stood by his men, outwitted stuffy reformers and {{conventional}} citizens, and lives on as the rascally King of <b>the</b> <b>Con</b> Men.|$|E
25|$|Kings Plaza {{has its own}} {{cogeneration}} plant {{on the roof of}} the mall, dubbed the Kings Plaza Total Energy Plant. The plant currently uses four Deutz AG natural gas engines to produce the mall's entire electricity needs with no connection to <b>the</b> <b>Con</b> Edison grid, while the heat from the engine exhaust is used to heat and cool the building. The plant, which was built with the mall, originally used five Nordberg-built diesel engines.|$|E
25|$|When Puss wakes up, he tracks Jack and Jill to San Ricardo {{where he}} learns the entire heist was a plot by Humpty to lure him {{home to be}} arrested, as revenge for abandoning him to the {{authorities}} when Humpty's youthful heist went bad. Jack, Jill, and Kitty were involved in <b>the</b> <b>con.</b> After pleas from Imelda, his adoptive mother, Puss turns himself in to the guards while Humpty donates many golden eggs to the town and becomes a hero.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>conning</b> tower {{has been}} removed by fishing nets and the broken periscope {{standards}} are still evident. <b>The</b> <b>conning</b> tower ladder {{is said to have}} been donated to the Submarine Museum but is not officially listed within their collections. E3s torpedo loading hatch is open and the bow section is largely intact.|$|R
40|$|Torque, face temperature, leakage, {{and wear}} {{of a flat}} face seal were {{compared}} with three coned face seals at pressures up to 2758 kPa and speeds up to 8000 rpm. Axial movement of the mating seal parts was recorded by a digital data acquisition system. <b>The</b> <b>coning</b> of <b>the</b> tungsten carbide primary ring ranged from. 51 micro-m to 5. 6 micro-m. The torque of <b>the</b> <b>coned</b> face seal balanced to 76. 3 % was an average 42 % lower, the leakage eleven times higher, {{than that of the}} standard flat face seal. The reduction of the balance of <b>the</b> <b>coned</b> face seal to 51. 3 % resulted by decreasing the torque by an additional 44 % and increasing leakage 12 to 230 times, depending on the seal shaft speed. No measurable wear was observed on the face of <b>the</b> <b>coned</b> seals...|$|R
50|$|Armament {{consisted}} of six 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes (four forward, {{one on each}} beam), plus a 4-inch deck gun. Originally, the gun was mounted on a breastwork fitted forward of <b>the</b> <b>conning</b> tower, but <b>the</b> breastwork was later extended to the bow and merged into the hull for streamlining, and the gun was relocated to a platform fitted {{to the front of}} <b>the</b> <b>conning</b> tower. <b>The</b> <b>conning</b> tower on J7 was sited 60 ft further back than her sister boats, as the control room was located behind the machinery spaces. 44 personnel were aboard.|$|R
25|$|Popular music gigs {{take place}} {{at a number of}} venues and pubs across the town {{including}} the Lewes Con Club, the Snowdrop Inn, the Volunteer Pub, the Lewes Arms, The John Harvey Tavern, The Pelham Arms, the Lamb and The Lansdown. The Elephant and Castle hosts the Saturday Folk Club. Union Music Store based in Lewes has become a centre for modern folk, country and Americana, both promoting and hosting live gigs, and recording and producing local musicians. A monthly comedy club based at <b>the</b> <b>Con</b> Club was created in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Andy Gibb guest-starred {{twice on}} Punky: once as himself, hosting a pre-teen beauty pageant; and once {{as a music}} {{instructor}} hired by Henry for Punky, who persuades the young man {{to go out for}} a recording contract. They run afoul of a con artist instead; Henry, correctly suspecting this man is up to no good, proclaims his own intention to break into the music business. When <b>the</b> <b>con</b> man repeats the same words to Henry that he said to the music teacher, he is exposed as a fraud; the teacher thanks Henry by giving Punky several free lessons.|$|E
25|$|Smith’s fame {{began in}} 1889 in Denver when he {{assaulted}} editor John Arkins of the Denver Rocky Mountain News. The newspaper {{declared war on}} Smith and the Soap Gang, sending articles and warnings about the bunco gang all across the U.S. Smith's fame continued to grow right up to and beyond the day he died. The story told in the Skaguay News on July 9, 1898, and newspapers throughout the country was that one brave man had sacrificed himself to slay a vicious con man – <b>the</b> <b>con</b> king of Skagway – so Skagway could be freed of all crime.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of May 2, 1975, the rebel prisoners on Côn Đảo Island {{successfully}} establish communications with North Vietnamese military units. To prepare {{for the arrival of}} the North Vietnamese, the Provisional Committee moved to set up a trench system around the island to defend against a possible South Vietnamese or U.S. counter-attack. On the morning of May 5, 1975, the North Vietnamese 171st and 172nd Naval Regiments landed on Côn Đảo Island with elements of the PAVN 3rd Division. Throughout the day regular North Vietnamese military units and the rebel prisoners coordinated their forces, to establish control over the rest of <b>the</b> <b>Côn</b> Đảo Archipelago.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{said that}} he was not {{concerned}} or focused on the events in Lucky's life while he was gone, stating: “You can't act information and you can't act history (...) That's what happened and that's what he's gone through, and that's that.” Jackson felt {{the heart and soul of}} the character were still the same; the foundation of Lucky was still the product of Luke and Laura. He described his portrayal as working through the contradictory traits Lucky inherited from his parents, the purity of Laura versus <b>the</b> <b>con</b> artist side of Luke. He explained that he was taking the essence of being their son and translating him into adulthood.|$|E
25|$|On 15 September 1956, Hanson {{at the age}} of 43 {{married a}} 23-year-old Conservatorium student, Moira Winifred Young, at St. Matthew's Anglican Church, Manly. The {{marriage}} was a very happy union despite the unconventionality of the age difference. The couple moved house several times {{over the next few years}} as prior to Hanson being placed on salary all teaching staff at <b>the</b> <b>Con</b> were contract players. Hanson's health deteriorated and in 1967 he suffered a heart attack. Young died in 1975, and after being appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in January 1976, Hanson himself died of myocardial infarction later that year, on 6 December. The couple were survived by three daughters.|$|E
