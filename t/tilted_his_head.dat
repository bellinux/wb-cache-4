2500|$|Erumbeeswarar Temple (எறும்பீஸ்வரர் கோயில்) in Thiruverumbur, Tamil Nadu, India, is a Hindu temple {{dedicated}} to the deity Shiva. Built on a [...] tall hill, it is accessible via a flight of steps. The temple's main shrines and its two prakarams (outer courtyards) are {{on top of the}} hill, while a hall and the temple tank are located at the foothills. Shiva is believed to have transformed himself into an ant hill and <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at this place to enable ants to climb up and worship him. Erumbeeswarar is revered in the canonical 7th-century Tamil Saiva work the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as nayanmars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam.|$|E
2500|$|Filming {{the role}} for Empire lasted three weeks. The actor {{was pleased with}} the costume and used it to convey the character's menace. Bulloch based his {{performance}} on Clint Eastwood's portrayal of the Man with No Name in A Fistful of Dollars; similar to the Western character, Bulloch cradled the gun prop, made the character seem ready to shoot, slightly <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and stood a particular way. Bulloch did not try to construct a backstory for the character, and said later that [...] "the less you do with Boba Fett, the stronger he becomes". Playing Fett in Empire was both the smallest and most physically uncomfortable role Bulloch has played; Bulloch said donning the heavy jetpack was the worst aspect of the role.|$|E
60|$|The Personage had <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> so {{far back}} that, {{in order to}} keep the Assistant Commissioner under his observation, he had to nearly close his eyes.|$|E
50|$|Since he stoops, he <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{and looks}} up at the person he speaks to, rather than at eye level.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would like}} to know who the Deuce you are?" [...] said Chaffery, {{suddenly}} <b>tilting</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> back so as to look through his glasses instead of over them, and laughing genially. [...] "For thoroughgoing Cheek, I'm inclined to think you take the Cake. Are you the Mr. Lewisham to whom this misguided girl refers in her letter?" ...|$|R
60|$|Sir Ethelred shifted {{one hand}} under his coat tails, and <b>tilting</b> back <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{looked at him}} steadily.|$|R
60|$|Summerlee {{had been}} so {{interested}} that he had stood unresisting while Challenger <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> into the air. Now he shook his colleague off {{and came back to}} his dignity.|$|E
6000|$|His lordship {{stared at}} her again. Then he half-closed his large, pale eyes, and <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> a little. [...] "I wonder why you hate him so," [...] he said softly.|$|E
60|$|He {{thrust his}} hands in his trouser-pockets and, {{spreading}} his legs wide apart, <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> back and blew smoke to the ceiling. He was in the same easy position when Ethel arrived home accompanied by Mr. Potter.|$|E
60|$|Lingard {{burst into}} a loud laugh which ended shortly in a deep sigh. He closed <b>his</b> eyes, <b>tilting</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{over the back of}} his armchair; and on his face, baked by the unclouded suns of many hard years, there {{appeared}} for a moment a weariness and a look of age which startled Almayer, like an unexpected disclosure of evil.|$|R
50|$|When {{the male}} begins to display, he erects the {{feathers}} {{of his throat}} and sides to accentuate the bright colours of his plumage in the shafts of sunlight that pierce the dimness of the rainforest. He curves his rounded wings above <b>his</b> body and <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> back to expose his chin and throat to the light, and then moves {{from side to side}} in a fashion that looks almost mechanical.|$|R
60|$|He looked his gratitude, put up his lips, {{but without}} enough <b>tilt</b> of <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{so that he}} {{received}} the water from Lute's hat {{down the back of}} his neck.|$|R
60|$|Smoke nodded, {{bending over}} the corpse, {{twisting}} it half up to face them, and {{pointing to a}} bullet wound in the temple. He glanced {{to the side and}} <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at a revolver that lay on top of the snow.|$|E
60|$|The Assistant Commissioner paused, then added: “Those fellows are {{a perfect}} pest.” In order {{to raise his}} {{drooping}} glance to the speaker’s face, the Personage on the hearthrug had gradually <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> farther back, which gave him an aspect of extraordinary haughtiness.|$|E
60|$|The {{satisfaction}} in the shrouded face was still plainer. The man tried to mumble out some words--could not succeed; tried to express something with his obstructed hands--failed; paused a moment, then feebly <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> in a meaning way, toward the corpse that lay nearest him.|$|E
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Eadweard Muybridge, pioneer of early action photography, 1872 - 1878. The portrait, taken fifteen years after Muybridge had successfully taken the famous photographic action series of Leland Stanford's horse, depicts the artist {{seated in a}} chair with his hands folded in his lap. He wears a suit and gazes to the left. His long white hair and beard are in disarray, his intense eyes set deep into <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and veiled in shadow. He <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to the side, making him look partially infirm or deranged. A note on the picture file card reads: "(Griffin?) "...|$|R
50|$|Carpenter's {{direction}} for Castle {{in his role}} as Myers was minimal. For example, when Castle asked what Myers' motivation was for a particular scene, Carpenter replied that his motivation was to walk from one set marker to another. The documentary titled Halloween Un-masked, featured in the 22nd anniversary DVD of Halloween, John Carpenter states he also instructed Castle to <b>tilt</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> a couple of times as if he was observing the corpse, particularly in the scene when Myers impaled one of his victims against a wall.|$|R
500|$|Harvey's attacking style {{often led}} to {{criticism}} that his batting was risky, with England captain Len Hutton {{feeling that he}} played and missed too much, while dour all-rounder Trevor Bailey quipped [...] "I wonder how many runs Harvey would make if he decided to stop playing strokes with an element of risk about them". Harvey was nevertheless happy to continue his flamboyant strokeplay. However, as Harvey progressed in seniority, he eschewed his hook shot and played more conservatively for his team's sake. He typically evaded bouncers by <b>tilting</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> rather than ducking the ball.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did it ruffle his pretty hair, then!" [...] she cried; and, {{with her}} hair-comb, she combed him straight. [...] "And his nice little moustache!" [...] she exclaimed. She <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> back and combed his young moustache. [...] "It's a wicked moustache, 'Postle," [...] she said. [...] "It's a red for danger. Have {{you got any}} of those cigarettes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, drink is a {{pleasant}} delight," [...] said Jan, {{as one who}} repeated a truism so familiar to his brain that he hardly noticed its passage over his tongue; and, lifting the cup, Coggan <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> gradually backwards, with closed eyes, that his expectant soul might not be diverted for one instant from its bliss by irrelevant surroundings.|$|E
6000|$|Robin took {{it without}} more ado {{and putting it}} to his lips, <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> back, while that which was within said [...] "glug!" [...] "lug! glug!" [...] {{for more than three}} winks, I wot. The stout Friar watched Robin anxiously the while, and when he was done took the pottle quickly. He shook it, held it betwixt his eyes and the light, looked reproachfully at the yeoman, and {{straightway}} placed it at his own lips. When it came away again there was nought within it.|$|E
50|$|J.D.'s most {{prominently}} featured quirk is his habit of daydreaming. When this happens, he <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> back {{and to his}} left, blankly looking upwards. The sequences played out in his daydreams are of surreal scenarios and situations that have just been mentioned or wondered about, often in an exaggerated manner. Many of these are followed by a comment from him which, although {{in keeping with his}} daydream, sounds strange and is often highly unrelated to the initial topic, very often earning him odd looks from nearby characters in the scene.|$|R

5000|$|Erling Ormsson {{was born}} at Etne in the county of Hordaland, Norway. He {{was the son of}} Kyrpinga Orm Sveinsson. He earned his {{reputation}} crusading with Rögnvald Kali Kolsson, the Earl of Orkney in the Mediterranean from 1152 to 1155. Erling first sailed to the Holy Land, then Constantinople, and lastly visited Rome. During a battle with Arab warriors on Sicily a sword-wielding Arab cut Erling in the neck. This caused him from then on to <b>tilt</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to one side ("skakke" [...] means slanted). He was married to Kristin Sigurdsdatter, the daughter of King Sigurd Jorsalfar.|$|R
6000|$|The people {{sat down}} and began to hammer on the tables with their flagons and call for [...] "the King's Audience!the King's Audience!the King's Audience!" [...] The Paladin stood there {{in one of his}} best attitudes, with his plumed great hat tipped over to the left, the folds of his short cloak {{drooping}} from his shoulder, and the one hand resting upon the hilt of his rapier and the other lifting his beaker. As the noise died down he made a stately sort of a bow, which he had picked up somewhere, then fetched his beaker with a sweep to his lips and <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> back and drained it to the bottom. The barber jumped for it and set it upon the Paladin's table. Then the Paladin began to walk up and down his platform {{with a great deal of}} dignity and quite at his ease; and as he walked he talked, and every little while stopped and stood facing his house and so standing continued his talk.|$|E
6000|$|He was {{presently}} almost cool, and {{his eyes}} got more used to the rush of air, but he was getting very high, very high. He <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> forwards and surveyed the country, blinking. He could see all over Buffalo, a place with three great blackened scars of ruin, and hills and stretches beyond. He {{wondered if he was}} half a mile high, or more. There were some people among some houses near a railway station between Niagara and Buffalo, and then more people. They went like ants busily {{in and out of the}} houses. He saw two motor cars gliding along the road towards Niagara city. Then far away in the south he saw a great Asiatic airship going eastward. [...] "Oh, Gord!" [...] he said, and became earnest in his ineffectual attempts to alter his direction. But that airship took no notice of him, and he continued to ascend convulsively. The world got more and more extensive and maplike. Click, clock, clitter-clock. Above him and very near to him now was a hazy stratum of cloud.|$|E

5000|$|She modeled {{a series}} of busts of musicians, {{including}} Metropolitan Opera conductor Artur Bodanzky, Russian pianist Ossip Gabrilowitsch, British pianist Harold Bauer, and Polish harpsichordist Wanda Landowska. Her bust of Spanish cellist Pablo Casals was highly praised:"When playing, he always closes <b>his</b> eyes, <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{a little to the}} side, and seemingly loses himself in the magic of his music. It is this characteristic pose, with eyes closed, that Brenda Putnam has captured perfectly. This portrait bust, which one can sincerely say is magnificently done, is in the Museum of the Hispanic Society, New York, and a replica is in Spain." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ivan {{is portrayed}} as a bird, with his robes acting as his wings, the {{constant}} thrusting and <b>tilting</b> of <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and the feathery like nature of his hair and beard. The bird symbolism will shift from prey to predatory throughout the films.|$|R
50|$|On {{the island}} of Keros (Κέρος), two marble statues from the late Neolithic culture called Early Cycladic culture (2900-2000 BCE) were {{discovered}} together in a single grave in the 19th century. They depict a standing double flute player and a sitting musician playing a triangular-shaped lyre or harp. The harpist is approximately 23 cm high and dates to around 2700-2500 BCE. He expresses concentration and intense feelings and <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> up to the light. The meaning of these and many other figures is not known; perhaps {{they were used to}} ward off evil spirits or had religious significance or served as toys or depicted figures from mythology.|$|R

40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Peter J. Horsch {{standing on the}} roof of a building, ca. 1930. Horsch is shown in full figure at center, dressed in a pinstripe suit. He has <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slightly towards the left, and his hips are angled slightly to the right. His left hand is partly clenched, while the other hangs open. The brick walls of the building's roof are visible in the background, while a drain is visible near Horsch's feet. He retired from the Title Insurance Company in 1950. He appears to be in his early fifties...|$|E
40|$|In Greek mythology, King Tantalus, {{a son of}} Zeus, was amortal {{favored by}} the gods. Invited to share ambrosia— food of the gods—Tantalus {{committed}} some unspecified breach of protocol, leading swiftly to his downfall. The unfortunate king was consigned to the lower world, there to undertake his punishment: eternal immersion in water up to his neck. More diabolically, whenever Tantalus <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to drink, the water drained away. Although lus-cious fruit hung above him on trees, whenever he extended his arms to grasp it, winds blew the branches beyond reach. From Tantalus’s name comes the English verb tantalize.

5000|$|After {{stepping}} down {{as head coach}} of the Packers following the 1967 NFL season, a restless Lombardi returned to coaching in 1969 with the Washington Redskins, where he broke a string of 14 losing seasons. The 'Skins would finish with a record of 7-5-2, significant for a number of reasons. Lombardi discovered that rookie running back Larry Brown was deaf in one ear, something that had escaped his parents, schoolteachers, and previous coaches. Lombardi had observed Brown's habit of <b>tilting</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in one direction when listening to signals being called, and walked behind him during drills and said [...] "Larry." [...] When Brown did not answer, the coach asked him to take a hearing exam. Brown was fitted with a hearing aid, and with this correction he would enjoy a successful NFL career.|$|R
40|$|At SIGGRAPH ` 91, UNC Chapel Hill {{demonstrated}} an electro-optical tracking system for HeadMounted Displays that can track a user inside a room-sized volume.

This paper gives a detailed description of this technique and its behavior in our working system. 1. 0 Introduction 1. 1 The optical ceiling head-tracker UNC Chapel Hill is actively conducting research in Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs). An HMD consists of a pair of video displays mounted in front of the user's eyes, a tracking system, and an image generation system. The tracker senses the position and orientation of the user's head and relays those measurements to the image generation system, which in turn updates the images on the video displays.
