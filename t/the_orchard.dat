5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} a garden at Little Moreton Hall comes from an early 17th-century set of household accounts referring to a gardener and the purchase of some seeds. Philip Moreton, who ran the estate for his older brother Edward in the mid-17th century, left {{a considerable amount of}} information on the layout and planting of the area of garden within the moat, {{to the west of the}} house. He writes of a herb garden, vegetable garden, and a nursery for maturing fruit trees until they were ready to be transferred to <b>the</b> <b>orchard</b> at the south and east of the house, probably where <b>the</b> <b>orchard</b> is today.|$|E
