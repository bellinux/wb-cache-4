[...] Hogan cites the bridge at around the three-minute mark as [...] "the closest thing to a climax" [...] on the song, [...] "when the track gets as quiet as it ever has before becoming as lush as it ever gets."

With the commercial success of punk and alternative rock bands in the early 1990s, All began considering offers from major labels. [...] "Major label talk started probably around '93 or '94", recalled guitarist Stephen Egerton. [...] "We maybe were just looking to sort of {{go to the next}} place, maybe. We had done this slow building up to where as many as a thousand people might be coming to see us in some places, which for us was a huge deal, so we thought we'd try to see if maybe we could get the records out to more people." [...] "In <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> we've seen bands like Green Day and Season to Risk turning up at the Walmart in Brookfield, Missouri", [...] remarked bassist Karl Alvarez. [...] "We really like the idea of getting our records in places where people go who aren't hip to the mom-and-pop record stores that traditionally carry the independents. People forget that punk rock was on the majors early on with bands like Iggy and the Ramones. The fact that the major labels ignored the real groundbreaking rock of the '80s gave everyone a real bad feeling about the majors, but as it stands now, they are starting to get a little hipper." ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} sociodemographic, {{physical}} and mental health characteristics of single mothers in Ontario. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Ontario residents aged 15 <b>years</b> <b>or</b> older who participated in the Ontario Health Supplement survey conducted between December 1990 and April 1991; of 9953 eligible participants, 1540 were mothers with at least 1 dependent child (less than 16 years of age). OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence rates of sociodemographic, {{physical and mental}} health characteristics. RESULTS: Single mothers were significantly more likely than the mothers in 2 -parent families to be poor, to be 25 <b>years</b> of age <b>or</b> less, to have mental health problems (dissatisfaction with multiple aspects of life, affective disorder ever and 1 or more psychiatric disorders in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> ever) and to use mental health services. When compared by income level, poor single mothers had a higher prevalence of all mental health outcomes measured; the difference was significant for anxiety disorder in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> ever and for 1 or more psychiatric disorders in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> ever. In a logistic regression analysis, single-mother status was found to have the strongest independent effect on predicting mental health morbidity and utilization of mental health services; the next strongest was low income. CONCLUSIONS: Single mothers {{are more likely to be}} poor, to have an affective disorder and to use mental health services than mothers in 2 -parent families. The risk of mental health problems is especially pronounced among poor single mothers. Further studies are needed to determine which aspects of single motherhood, apart from economic status, affect mental health outcomes...|$|R

50|$|The club is {{currently}} experiencing a poor run of form, which reflects a recent {{downturn in the}} standard of players available. Working from a small pool of talent to begin with, the club has in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> struggled to attract enough adult players - less local men want to play rugby, the best talent is attracted to larger Border clubs, and poor results discourage players from wanting to turn out for the club. Changes in coaching staff and two recent relegations have also damaged the club's appeal. Of course, poor results encourage players to leave the club, which in turn causes a weaker team to be fielded, and poor results continue. The financial difficulties of playing 11 away league matches plus cup matches a season, generally against clubs based in the Central Belt and the north-east, and the (admittedly shorter) journeys in the Border League, also places a strain on the club, which attracts only a few dozen fans to home games, and charge only a minimal admittance fee.
