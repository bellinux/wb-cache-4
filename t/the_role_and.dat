However, the local guides also have several problems. They are mastering language, presenting monotonous presentation, handling tourists in group and being undisciplined. To overcome that, the solutions are taking language course, making improvisation, using a microphone, and giving a punishment...|$|R

This {{article describes the}} evaluation of a student-designed, case-based educational module about <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> {{responsibilities of}} occupational therapists (OTs) designed to increase the knowledge of occupational therapy among medical students. The study used a quasi-experimental, pre-/post-test design.

40|$|ADMINISTRATIVE PREPARATION OF UNDERGRADUATE ATHLETIC TRAINING PROGRAM DIRECTORSBridgett Mary Passauer, EdDUniversity of Pittsburgh, 2004 Throughout higher education, {{faculty members}} have assumed <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> {{responsibilities}} of academic administrators. The field of athletic training is no different. Certified athletic trainers assume <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> responsibilities of academic administrators {{when they are}} named program directors. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if undergraduate athletic training program directors perceived themselves as prepared for <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> responsibilities of academic administration. The undergraduate athletic training program directors were also asked for suggestions on how best to prepare future athletic training program directors. Eighty-nine undergraduate athletic training program directors responded to an electronically distributed survey which revealed that, overall, undergraduate athletic training program directors do not feel prepared for <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> responsibilities associated with academic administration. One of the interesting results was found when analyzing the difference between types of candidates selected for the position of undergraduate athletic training program director. Internal candidates had higher mean scores for all <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> responsibilities however; only one of the mean scores was above a 3. 00. The overall population of respondents rated <b>the</b> <b>role</b> of leader <b>and</b> mentor as <b>the</b> <b>role</b> they felt most prepared for with <b>the</b> <b>role</b> of faculty developer being <b>the</b> <b>role</b> they felt least prepared for. When asked to recommend the level of education that a program specifically geared toward educating future athletic training program directors, a minimum of a Master's degree was recommended by all respondents. This research further supports previous research, which sites the need for more comprehensive preparation of academic administrators, ideally prior to, but minimally, once appointed to the position of academic administrator...|$|R
