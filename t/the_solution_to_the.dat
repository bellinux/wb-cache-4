5|$|Many of the {{important}} mathematical applications of mirror symmetry belong to the branch of mathematics called enumerative geometry. In enumerative geometry, one is interested in {{counting the number of}} solutions to geometric questions, typically using the techniques of algebraic geometry. One of the earliest problems of enumerative geometry was posed around the year 200 BCE by the ancient Greek mathematician Apollonius, who asked how many circles in the plane are tangent to three given circles. In general, <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> problem of Apollonius is that there are eight such circles.|$|E
5|$|Jimmy Kudo (Japanese: Shinichi Kudo) is a {{high school}} detective who {{sometimes}} works with the police to solve cases. During an investigation, he is attacked by members of a crime syndicate known as the Black Organization. They force him to ingest an experimental poison, but instead of killing him, the poison transforms him into a child. Adopting the pseudonym Conan Edogawa and keeping his true identity a secret, Kudo lives with his childhood friend Rachel Moore (Ran Mouri) and her father Richard (Kogoro), who is a private detective. Throughout the series, he tags along on Richard's cases, but when {{he is able to}} solve one, he uses a tranquilizer needle to put Richard to sleep, and impersonates his voice to reveal <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> case. He also enrolls in a local elementary school where he makes friends with a group of classmates who form their own Junior Detective club (Detective Boys). While he continues to dig deeper into the Black Organization, he frequently interacts with a variety of characters, including his professor friend Dr. Agasa, Ran's friend Serena (Sonoko), a fellow teenage detective Harley Hartwell (Heiji Hattori), various police detectives from different regions, and the Kaito Kid.|$|E
5|$|Plans for {{a second}} Narrows Bridge were mooted during the 1970s, but did not eventuate. By 1998, the {{original}} bridge was carrying 155,000 vehicles per day, {{with an average of}} 2,700 cars per lane between 7:30am and 8:30am, and was thought to be the busiest section of freeway in the country. This quantity of traffic far outstripped the expected capacity of the bridge when it opened in 1959. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> traffic problem most favoured by road planners in 1998 was to widen the existing bridge by building a smaller second traffic bridge just west from it and joining their decks to form a contiguous roadway. This would increase the number of traffic lanes from seven to 10. The widening was expected to cost $50 million.|$|E

5|$|The {{interceptor}} {{would lose}} maneuverability as it {{climbed out of}} the atmosphere and its aerodynamic surfaces became less effective, so {{it would have to be}} directed onto the target as rapidly as possible, leaving only minor fine tuning later in the engagement. This required that accurate tracks be developed for both the warhead and outgoing missile very quickly in comparison to a system like Nike B where the guidance could be updated throughout the engagement. This demanded new computers and tracking radars with much higher processing rates than the systems used on earlier Nikes.

The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory's director, Arthur B. McDonald, {{is a member}} of the university's physics department. The observatory managed the SNO experiment, which demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> solar neutrino problem was that neutrinos change flavour (type) as they propagate through the Sun. The SNO experiment proved that a non-zero mass neutrino exists. This was a major breakthrough in cosmology. In October 2015, Arthur B. McDonald and Takaaki Kajita (University of Tokyo) jointly received the Nobel Prize in Physics for illustration of neutrino change identities and identification of mass. This is the first Nobel Prize awarded to a Queen's University researcher. In 1976 urologist Alvaro Morales, along with his colleagues, developed the first clinically effective immunotherapy for cancer by adapting the Bacille Calmette-Guérin tuberculosis vaccine for treatment of early stage bladder cancer.|$|E
5|$|Treasurer of the United States Francis E.

Postage (or postal) currency {{was the first of}} five issues of US Post Office fractional paper money printed in 5-cent, 10-cent, 25-cent, and 50-cent denominations and issued from 21 August 1862 through 27 May 1863. Spinner proposed using postage stamps, affixed to Treasury paper, with his signature on the bottom (see illustration below). Based on this initiative, Congress supported a temporary solution involving fractional currency and on 17 July 1862 President Lincoln signed the Postage Currency Bill into law. The intent, however, was not that stamps should be a circulating currency.|$|E
