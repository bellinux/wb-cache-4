5|$|Mauna Kea's {{summit is}} one of the best sites in the world for astronomical {{observation}} due to favorable observing conditions. The arid conditions are important for submillimeter and infrared astronomy for this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. <b>The</b> <b>summit</b> is above the inversion layer, keeping most cloud cover below <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> and ensuring the air on <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> is dry, and free of atmospheric pollution. <b>The</b> <b>summit</b> atmosphere is exceptionally stable, lacking turbulence for some of the world's best astronomical seeing. The very dark skies resulting from Mauna Kea's distance from city lights are preserved by legislation that minimizes light pollution from the surrounding area; the darkness level allows the observation of faint astronomical objects. These factors historically made Mauna Kea an excellent spot for stargazing.|$|E
5|$|The Llanberis Path is {{the longest}} route to <b>the</b> <b>summit,</b> and has the shallowest gradient. It largely follows {{the line of the}} Snowdon Mountain Railway, and is {{considered}} the easiest and least interesting route to <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> of Snowdon. It is the route used by the annual Snowdon Race, with a record time of less than 40 minutes recorded from the start to <b>the</b> <b>summit.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Rhyd Ddu path, {{also called}} the Beddgelert Path, leads {{from the village of}} Rhyd Ddu, west of Snowdon, gently up on to Llechog, a broad ridge {{dropping}} west from <b>the</b> <b>summit.</b> It {{is considered one of the}} easier routes to <b>the</b> <b>summit,</b> with the advantage that <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> is visible from the start, but is one of the least used routes. It climbs at a shallow gradient to Bwlch Main, shortly southwest of <b>the</b> <b>summit,</b> from where it climbs more steeply, meeting up with the Watkin Path at a site marked with a large standing stone a few hundred metres from <b>the</b> <b>summit.</b> An alternative start begins at Pitt's Head on the A4085 road.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mountain}} has two summits, named Øystre Rasletind and Rasletind (Øystre meaning Eastern). The name probably {{derives from}} the Norwegian word for rumble [...] "rasle" [...] - the sound of stones falling down. The south wall of <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> is steep, so this makes the rumble-theory even more plausible. The name {{is also found in}} the tarn south of <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> and <b>the</b> smaller <b>summit</b> on <b>the</b> south end of the plain south of <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> is called Raslet.|$|R

5|$|The first {{building}} on <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> of Snowdon was erected in 1838 to sell refreshments, and a licence to sell intoxicating liquor was granted in 1845. Very basic accommodation was also provided for visitors. When the Snowdon Mountain Railway was opened in 1896, it added its own accommodation and sales outlet near <b>the</b> <b>summit.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} Scout jamboree usually occurs {{every four}} years, and draws more than 30,000 Scouts {{from across the}} country and the world. The last jamboree took place in 2017 at <b>The</b> <b>Summit</b> in West Virginia. <b>The</b> <b>Summit</b> is to be a permanent place for the Jamboree and an opportunity to construct a new high-adventure base.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>summit</b> area is {{triangular}} in {{plan with}} ridges {{running to the}} north, south and east. The actual top is toward the northern corner and set back a little from the drop to Nethermost Cove. There is a rash of stones on <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> although the surroundings are mostly covered in rough grass, and several small cairns have been built. Other than northward, where the bulk of Helvellyn intervenes, the view is extensive, {{with much of the}} Lake District visible. Further ground is brought into view from <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> of High Crag.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} groups of awards: one for the activators, {{operating}} from <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> according to <b>the</b> SOTA rules, one for the chasers (who contact the activators on <b>the</b> <b>summits),</b> and one for non-amateur radio operators doing shortwave listening.|$|R
5000|$|From <b>the</b> eastern <b>summit,</b> a long rappel {{is needed}} to reach the very steep and narrow pass between <b>the</b> two <b>summits.</b> <b>The</b> climb to <b>the</b> middle <b>summit</b> needs no equipment. From <b>the</b> middle <b>summit</b> three rappels are needed {{to get all the}} way down to the even more steep and narrow pass between <b>the</b> two last <b>summits.</b> <b>The</b> climb up <b>the</b> lowest, western <b>summit,</b> is quite easy, but many would prefer to use a rope on a short part of the climb. From <b>the</b> western <b>summit,</b> a sharp edge leads down to the long ridge turning northwards towards lake Gjende. The rest of the descent is long talus slopes.|$|R

40|$|It {{is argued}} here that <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> {{should not be}} {{transformed}} or elevated to some system of global economic governance. Rather, global economic stability depends on good domestic economic policymaking and, thus, <b>the</b> economic <b>summits</b> cannot substitute for effective and effcient policymaking within sovereign nations. <b>The</b> <b>summits,</b> therefore, should be seen first and foremost {{as a means for}} improving and generating better domestic policies via cooperation as opposed to delivering packages of coordinated policies. By focusing on international economic policy cooperation, <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> can contribute much to improving domestic economic policymaking. The protest at <b>the</b> Genoa <b>summit</b> and <b>the</b> events of September 11 provide a well-timed opportunity to rethink the format of <b>the</b> <b>summits,</b> to streamline <b>the</b> process, and to return to the European or Rambouillet model of summitry. Perhaps this is <b>the</b> path <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> are on following the “secluded and intimate” 2002 summit in Kananaskis (Bayne, 2002). The world was a very uncertain place in 1975. There were oil shocks, an unsettled foreign-exchange system, and a global recession. <b>The</b> original <b>summit</b> was formed to deal with these uncertainties. The world is again an uncertain place, with financial crises, the emergence of Russia and China as political and economic forces, terrorist attacks on the United States, an economic downturn among the advanced economies, and turbulence in the world’s equity markets. <b>The</b> annual <b>summits</b> remain as a significant forum for sharing information and reducing this uncertainty. ...|$|R

5|$|Because of {{its close}} {{proximity}} to the higher Helvellyn, Nethermost Pike receives fewer visitors. When climbing from the west many people traverse the western slopes on their way to Helvellyn. Despite this <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> does still receive a large number of walkers, who use a large number of footpaths. The large number of footpaths causes significant disturbance to <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> vegetation, which could be greatly reduced by using fewer footpaths.|$|E

5|$|Ben Nevis's popularity, {{climate and}} complex {{topography}} {{contribute to a}} high number of mountain rescue incidents. In 1999, for example, there were 41 rescues and four fatalities on the mountain. Some accidents arise over difficulties in navigating to or from <b>the</b> <b>summit,</b> especially in poor visibility. The problem {{stems from the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> plateau is roughly kidney-shaped and surrounded by cliffs on three sides; the danger is particularly accentuated when the main path is obscured by snow. Two precise compass bearings taken in succession are necessary to navigate from <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> cairn to the west flank, from where a descent can be made on the Pony Track in relative safety.|$|E
5|$|Canada's largest banks, {{which are}} {{headquartered}} in Downtown Toronto, {{made plans to}} have employees work at alternate sites outside their downtown facilities, such as {{at home or in}} other branches. The Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) announced the closure of seven liquor stores in the downtown core during <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> as a precaution to looting. The PATH, CN Tower, University of Toronto, Art Gallery of Ontario, and the Ontario Legislative Building were also closed to public during <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> dates.|$|E
