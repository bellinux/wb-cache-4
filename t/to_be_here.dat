He was the first Eagles player to be inducted. Clarke Hinkle presented him with the honor at the induction ceremony. Van Buren's acceptance speech consisted of four sentences:Thank you Clarke Hinkle, I'm certainly glad to have broken your record. Since you people can't hear too good and I'm not too good a speaker I won't say much, but it's a great honor <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here.</b> The two days I've spent in Canton will certainly bring me back every year from now on.

I definitely {{want to be able to}} sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex that I have to be able to sing, period, with a band.

25|$|Freyr himself {{interrupts}} at this point, {{and says}} that he sees a wolf lying before a river mouth, and that, unless Loki is immediately silent, like the wolf, Loki shall also be bound until Ragnarök. Loki retorts that Freyr purchased his consort Gerðr with gold, having given away his sword, which he will lack at Ragnarök. Byggvir (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says {{that if he had}} as noble a lineage and as an honorable a seat as Freyr, he would grind down Loki, and make all of his limbs lame. Loki refers to Byggvir in terms of a dog, {{and says that}} Byggvir is always found at Freyr's ears, or twittering beneath a grindstone. Byggvir says that he's proud <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> by all the gods and men, and that he's said to be speedy. Loki tells him to be silent, that Byggvir does not know how to apportion food among men, and that he hides among the straw and dais when men go to battle.|$|E

However, Diefenbaker proved a gadfly and an annoyance to Mackenzie King.

500|$|Moore {{played an}} FBI {{agent for the}} second time in Next (2007), a science fiction action film co-starring Nicolas Cage and Jessica Biel. Based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, the {{response}} from critics was highly negative. Manhola Dargis wrote, [...] "Ms. Moore seems terribly unhappy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here,</b> and it's no wonder." [...] The actress has since described it as her worst film. Next was followed by Savage Grace (2007), the true story of Barbara Daly Baekeland—a high-society mother whose Oedipal relationship with her son ended in murder. Moore was fascinated by the role. Savage Grace had a limited release, and received predominantly negative reviews. Peter Bradshaw, however, called it a [...] "coldly brilliant and tremendously acted movie." ...|$|E

[...] After Grant left the White House, he and his wife decided to use their US$85,000 of savings to travel around the world. A biographer from the New York Herald, John Russell Young, traveled with the Grants and documented their journey to exotic places around the world in a book later published called Around the World with General Grant. Young saw that Grant's popularity was soaring, as he was treated with splendid receptions at his arrival in Tokyo and Peking, China.|$|E
500|$|In June 2012 the Dumas was {{conveyed}} to new owners, locals Michael Piche and Travis Eskelson. By this time however, {{the building was}} in great disrepair; among other things, there was water damage, a collapsed wall and no structurally sound roof. The new owners planned to have summer tours for $8 in the following year, but their ultimate goal was turning the Dumas into a bed and breakfast. [...] "It needs to be around. It needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> {{for the rest of}} the community and the people who want to visit it," [...] said Piche. In late 2013 the duo sought a loan from the local urban revitalization body in Butte. The requested amount was $92,000 with an additional $8,750 grant. As of December 2013, tours were still being offered at the Dumas on a limited basis.|$|E
