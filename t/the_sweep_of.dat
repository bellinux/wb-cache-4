5|$|In {{reviewing}} <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> botanical history it {{is evident}} that, {{through the power of}} the scientific method, most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function of plants have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan for}} Prior Park was to {{construct}} five buildings along three {{sides of a}} dodecagon matching <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> {{the head of the}} valley, with the main building being flanked by elongated wings based on designs by Andrea Palladio. The plans were influenced by drawings in Vitruvius Britannicus originally made by Colen Campbell for Wanstead House in Essex, which was yet to be built. The main block had 15 bays and each of the wings 17 bays each. Between each wing and the main block was a Porte-cochère for coaches to stop under. In addition to the stone from the local quarries, material, including the grand staircase and plasterwork, from the demolished Hunstrete House were used in the construction.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} soon devolved into man-on-man combat; Seydlitz himself fought like a trooper, {{receiving a}} severe wound. He ordered his last 18 squadrons, still {{waiting at the}} Janus, into the fray. The second charge struck the French cavalry at an oblique angle. The mêlée drifted rapidly southward, past the Allied infantry. Part of the Allied reserve, which had become entangled between the main columns, was extricating itself by degrees and endeavoring {{to catch up with}} the rest of the reserve column away to the right, but <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> horses and Allied infantry pulled them into the fighting. The Allied reserve artillery proved useless; caught in the middle of the infantry columns, it could not deploy to support any of the endangered Allied troops. The Prussian infantry on the Shartau hill waited in echelon from the left. Those Allied units who escaped the artillery and the horsemen ran headlong into a hail of musket fire from Prince Henry's infantry. Attempted French counterattacks dissolved into confusion. Most of the Allied cavalry units in front were smashed by the initial charge and many of them trampled over their own men trying to flee. The field was littered with riderless horses and horseless men, wounded, dying and dead. This part of the action took about 30 minutes.|$|E

The Dodgers won the game 4–3 thanks to a two-run home run by Matt Kemp in the seventh inning to extend the team's winning streak to five games. Ethier injured the little finger on his right hand and was scratched from the lineup on May 15, but the Dodgers extended their winning streak as Clayton Kershaw threw a three-hitter over seven innings and James Loney hit a home run in the 4–1 win.

25|$|Carlos Frías pitched 5 {{scoreless}} {{innings in}} his first start of the season, and rookie Joc Pederson hit a grand slam home run as the Dodgers opened the month of May with an 8–0 rout of the Arizona Diamondbacks at Dodger Stadium. The Dodgers came from behind to take game two of the series, 6–4. Pederson homered again, becoming the first Dodgers rookie since Bill Sudakis in the 1969 season to homer in four straight ballgames. A walk-off homer by Yasmani Grandal in the 13th inning gave the Dodgers a 1–0 win on May 3 and <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> the Diamondbacks. The game was the longest scoreless duel between the two teams since the game on June 2, 2010, ended in the 14th inning.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers injury {{epidemic}} {{continued as}} Hanley Ramírez, after playing {{in just four}} games, injured his hamstring in the May 3 game against the San Francisco Giants at AT Park. Clayton Kershaw allowed only 3 hits and 1 run in 7 innings but the Giants won 2-1 on a walk-off home run by Buster Posey. The following day, Matt Magill got pounded in his second start, allowing 5 runs in only 1.1 innings. The Dodgers fell behind 6-1 but came back to tie the game, partially thanks to Dee Gordon who tripled, stole two bases and scored two runs. However, they wound up losing 10-9 on a walk-off home run by Guillermo Quiróz in the 10th inning. The Giants completed <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> the injury-riddled Dodgers the next day, 4-3.|$|E

An exquisitely pure and severe rhythm of line and contour chastens the sensuous richness of the painting. <b>The</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> white drapery on which the goddess lies; and the glowing landscape that fills the space behind her; most harmoniously frame her divinity. The use of an external landscape to frame a nude is innovative; but in addition, to add to her mystery, she is shrouded in sleep, spirited away from accessibility to any conscious expression.|$|E
25|$|Trailing by 3 {{games in}} the Wild Card race with 6 games remaining, the Dodgers {{returned}} home on September 28 to play the Colorado Rockies. Clayton Kershaw struck out 10 in 8 scoreless innings and Shane Victorino hit a three-run homer in the 2nd inning as the Dodgers won 8-0. The Dodgers scored 8 runs in their third straight game, {{the first time they}} had done that since July 8–14, 2007. Matt Kemp hit 2 home runs on September 29 and Joe Blanton and 3 relievers combined to shut out the Rockies 3-0. The win, coupled with the Cardinals losing a game to the Nationals, moved the Dodgers to 2 back in the Wild Card race with 4 games remaining. The Dodgers finished off <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> the Rockies with a 7-1 win. Kemp, A.J. Ellis and Cruz all homered in the win.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} {{home for a}} three-game series against the Cincinnati Reds. Clayton Kershaw continued his strong start to the season, pitching a complete game two-hit shutout as the Dodgers won 1–0. Kershaw was the first Dodger pitcher with three shutouts in a month since Tim Belcher in 1989 {{and the first to}} last seven or more innings in his first 10 starts of the year since Fernando Valenzuela in 1981. The Dodgers, behind Bolsinger, handed the Reds their ninth straight loss, 8–2 on May 24. The Dodgers finished off <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> the Reds with a 3–1 win in the finale. Scott Kazmir struck out 12 in six innings, and combined with Reds starter Dan Straily, who struck out 11, they were the first regular season due to each strike out 11 or more batters at Dodger Stadium since Grant Jackson and Bill Singer on June 12, 1969.|$|E

The Dodgers won 8–5, despite Brandon League allowing three runs to score in the ninth. Gonzalez, Kemp and Juan Uribe all homered as the Dodgers completed <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> the Diamondbacks 8–6. The Dodgers next dropped the opener of a three-game series at AT Park to the Giants in 12 innings. The Giants also won the next game, 2–1, despite an effective start by Paul Maholm, who allowed only one run in six innings. Ryu pitched seven scoreless innings in the series finale as the Dodgers won 2–1, {{he became the first}} Dodger pitcher since Orel Hershiser in 1988 to pitch four consecutive scoreless road starts.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home {{for their first}} homestand under the new ownership and beat the San Francisco Giants 9-1. The next night, Clayton Kershaw gave up a two-run homer to Brett Pill {{in the second inning}} before settling down to pitch eight strong innings, but the Dodgers were unable to get runs in against Ryan Vogelsong and lost 2–1. A three-run pinch hit triple by Tony Gwynn, Jr. gave the Dodgers the lead in the series finale against the Giants and they held on to win 6-2. On May 11, Capuano improved his record to 5–0, while allowing just one run on four hits in seven innings. Mark Ellis, Juan Uribe and Andre Ethier provided the offense as each hit a home run in the clubs 7–3 win over the Rockies. Aaron Harang allowed just one run in eight innings on May 12 and Tony Gwynn, Jr. came through again with a pinch hit RBI to drive in the winning run in the Dodgers 2–1 victory over the Rockies. The Dodgers completed <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> the Rockies thanks to a 3-RBI double by Bobby Abreu and a 3-run homer by A. J. Ellis that led the team to an 11–5 win in the series finale. Kershaw pitched seven scoreless innings to outduel Ian Kennedy on May 14, as the Dodgers beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 3–1. Chad Billingsley struggled and the Dodgers had difficulty scoring in the finale of the homestand, losing to the Diamondbacks 5-1 and snapping their five-game winning streak.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on April 23 and remained undefeated at Dodger Stadium by beating the Atlanta Braves 7–2. Juan Uribe tied a career high with four hits {{and drove in}} three runs in the win. They picked up their first home loss of the season the next night, as Martín Prado hit a tie breaking RBI triple off of Javy Guerra in the ninth {{to set up the}} Braves 4-3 win. The Dodgers lost again the next night as Guerra gave up three runs in the ninth inning and the Braves came back to win 4–2 despite Matt Kemp's 10th home run of the season, which tied Gary Sheffield's club record for home runs in April set in 2000. The Washington Nationals came to town next and the Dodgers won the opener 3–2 as ace Clayton Kershaw allowed only two runs in eight innings for his 12th straight win at Dodger Stadium. A two run home run by Andre Ethier accounted for most of the offense. On April 28, Billingsley matched up against Stephen Strasburg and both pitched well, allowing one run each in seven innings of work. 19-year-old 2010 top draft pick Bryce Harper made his Major League debut for the Nationals, crushing a double for his first hit and driving in a run on a sacrifice fly to put the Nationals up in the ninth but the Dodgers came back to tie it {{in the bottom of the}} ninth. Matt Kemp crushed a walk-off home run off Tom Gorzelanny for the 4–3 win. It was Kemp's 11th home run of the season, breaking Sheffield's club record. The Dodgers completed <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> the Nationals when James Loney's two RBI single backed Chris Capuano's 6 shutout innings in a 2–0 victory in the finale of the homestand.|$|E
