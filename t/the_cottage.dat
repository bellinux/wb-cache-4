50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cottages</b> {{are located}} about 200 metres {{from the site}} of the main stadium used in the 2012 Olympic Games. In 2005, <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> became part of a {{compulsory}} purchase order for the Games, giving rise to speculation that the building may be demolished. However, <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> and gardens remain unchanged.|$|R
5000|$|... 1997 - Present <b>The</b> <b>cottages</b> {{were taken}} over by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, who removed many {{non-native}} plants and spent $230,000 restoring <b>the</b> <b>cottages,</b> lighthouse, and walking tracks.|$|R
5|$|The {{swimming}} baths {{are in a}} walled garden, {{which used}} to include seating, and includes mature trees. <b>The</b> <b>cottage</b> and changing rooms are laid out as a Georgian crescent.|$|E

5|$|The caretaker's cottage is two storeys high, {{built of}} {{limestone}} ashlar with a slate roof. It has sash windows {{to the south}} and north, with false windows on the east and west ends. Access to the pool is through the ground floor lobby of <b>the</b> <b>cottage.</b> Inside, the original panelled ceiling remains intact as well as a hob and fireplace in the bedroom and another early 19th-century fireplace on the ground floor. On either side of <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> are six changing cubicles with sloping roofs covered with asbestos sheets. At the western end are two further dressing rooms and the perpetual shower which was linked to the ladies' pool.|$|E
50|$|Some of <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> in <b>the</b> village are 17th century. In 1939 Williams-Ellis remodelled all <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> in Cornwell and remodelled {{the former}} village school in neo-Georgian style as the village hall.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Childrens <b>Cottages</b> at Kew {{were first}} opened in 1887 as the [...] "Idiot Ward" [...] of Kew Asylum. Located on the asylums grounds, <b>the</b> childrens <b>cottages</b> were {{established}} to provide separate accommodation for child inmates {{who had previously}} been housed with adult patients. Although <b>the</b> <b>Cottages</b> only admitted children as patients, many of those children remained in residence at <b>the</b> <b>Cottages</b> as adults.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Coastguard <b>Cottages</b> at Cuckmere Haven {{were built}} {{shortly after the}} National Coastguard Service was founded in 1822. Prior to this Cuckmere Haven was an {{important}} place for smuggling. The cliff face in front of <b>the</b> <b>Cottages</b> has since retreated by more than 30 metres due to Coastal erosion. This combined {{with the loss of}} shingle from the beach below <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> due to wave action in storms has put <b>the</b> <b>Cottages</b> in danger. A fundraising campaign has been created to protect these iconic buildings.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cottage</b> was {{constructed}} in the 17th century as two attached buildings. One contained a parlour, kitchen and service room {{on the ground floor}} and three corresponding bed chambers above, and an adjoining byre or barn.|$|E
5|$|A brick privy with a {{gabled roof}} clad in {{corrugated}} asbestos sheeting is located {{to the north}} of <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> building. It was probably constructed circa 1930. Further north is the workshop building, which also housed the electricity generators at one point, dating from the 1950s. It features a flat and skillion roof, and concrete mounting blocks. Its most recent use was as a fishermen's cabin.|$|E
5|$|After the 5.5 Richter Scale {{magnitude}} 1968 Illinois earthquake, scientists {{realized that}} there was a previously unknown fault under Saline County, just north of Eldorado, Illinois near Harrisburg. This fault is called <b>the</b> <b>Cottage</b> Grove Fault, a small tear in the Earth's rock running west–east, in the Southern Illinois Basin. The fault is connected to the north–south trending Wabash Valley Fault System at its eastern end. Seismographic mapping completed by geologists reveal that monoclines, anticlines, and synclines are present within the region; these signs suggest deformation during the Paleozoic era coincident to strike-slip faulting nearby.|$|E
50|$|Forge Row is {{a terrace}} of six, {{originally}} twelve, cottages build around 1804 for workers {{at a nearby}} forge in Cwmavon, Torfaen, south east Wales. <b>The</b> <b>cottages</b> have been sympathetically restored.

50|$|The {{original}} row of four cottages {{was built}} in the 1840s by James and Sally Pearson, who were independent cloth manufacturers. It {{was built in}}to a steep hillside with a traditional entrance for the lower rooms and a separate entrance to the upper floor at the rear of <b>the</b> <b>cottages.</b> In 1970, three of <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> were converted to house the museum. They named <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> 'Spring Rock'.|$|R
50|$|In 1979 a {{state court}} ruled that <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> were illegal, as the {{underlying}} property was public parkland. All but four of <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> were removed in 2004. The remaining ones are being adapted for public purposes.|$|R
5|$|Having {{served for}} many years as 'Moore's Coleridge Cottage Inn', the {{building}} was acquired for the nation in 1908, and the following year it was {{handed over to the}} National Trust. On 23 May 1998, following a £25,000 appeal by the Friends of Coleridge and the National Trust, two further rooms on the first floor were officially opened by Lord Coleridge a descendant of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In 2011 the National Trust undertook a major re-presentation project that also saw the opening of additional rooms. The oldest parts of <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> are now presented as the Coleridge family might have known them, with the original inglenook fireplace in the parlour uncovered and working once more. The garden was opened to visitors for the first time, complete with an 18th-century vegetable plot, a wildflower area and representations of Coleridge's animals. It is possible to listen to poetry at audio posts around the garden and the well is operational once more and {{can be seen in the}} small courtyard behind <b>the</b> <b>cottage.</b> A number of mementos of Coleridge are on display including his inkstand, locks of his hair and correspondence in his handwriting.|$|E
5|$|In 1862, Lee and the Shaws {{agreed to}} share a house, No. 1 Hatch Street, in an {{affluent}} part of Dublin, and a country cottage on Dalkey Hill, overlooking Killiney Bay. Shaw, a sensitive boy, found the less salubrious parts of Dublin shocking and distressing, and was happier at <b>the</b> <b>cottage.</b> Lee's students often gave him books, which the young Shaw read avidly; thus, as well as gaining a thorough musical knowledge of choral and operatic works, he became familiar with {{a wide spectrum of}} literature.|$|E
5|$|In 19th Century Russia, Vladimir Durfe (Mark Damon) {{is a young}} nobleman {{who finds}} a {{beheaded}} corpse with a knife plunged into its heart. He takes the blade, and finds shelter in a small cottage. Durfe is approached by Giorgio (Glauco Onorato) who explains that the knife belongs to his father, {{who has not been}} seen for five days. Giorgio offers a room to Durfe and introduces him {{to the rest of the}} family: his wife (Rika Dialina), their young son Ivan, Giorgio's younger brother Pietro (Massimo Righi), and sister Sdenka (Susy Andersen). They all await the return of Gorca, who has gone to fight the wurdalak, a living cadaver who feeds on human blood, especially of close friends and family members. At midnight, Gorca (Boris Karloff) returns to <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> with a sour demeanor and unkempt appearance. After the family goes to sleep, Ivan and Pietro are attacked by Gorca who flees <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> with Ivan. Giorgio chases after Gorca but only returns with Ivan's corpse. Giorgio plans to stake and behead Ivan to prevent him from reviving as a Wurdalak, but is prevented from doing so by his wife. The two agree to give their son a burial.|$|E
50|$|On 1 August 1920 Stuartholme {{was officially}} opened. In {{the first year}} the school was run on the verandas of <b>the</b> <b>cottages.</b> <b>The</b> nuns and pupils lived in <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> and only six {{students}} were enrolled. The number of pupils grew and between 1925-1940 there were 36 students attending Stuartholme.|$|R
50|$|At a {{time when}} the only {{treatment}} for TB was fresh air and rest, <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> had verandas so that TB patient’s beds could be pushed outside. <b>The</b> <b>cottages</b> were large enough that patient’s families could live with them. Eventually about 30 cottages were built.|$|R
5000|$|As {{planned the}} estate was to contain 1527 houses, {{referred}} to as cottages, built at a density of 27 /acre. <b>The</b> first 304 <b>cottages</b> and five shops had been completed by January 1914, and the drainage and sewers laid for the rest when the war halted construction[...] Each of <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> and maisonettes had a scullery and the WC but only <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> of five and four rooms and 14 of <b>the</b> three-roomed <b>cottages</b> were fitted with baths.|$|R
5|$|Mrs Smith's Cottage is a {{mid-19th century}} Grade II listed {{building}} made from early Victorian red bricks. The range, {{the heart of}} the house, was in daily use for cooking and heating until the mid-1990s. The only access to the bedrooms is by a ladder. Electricity was installed in the 1930s, and the only other visible modern innovations are the coldwater tap – installed to prevent the local council condemning <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> in the late 1970s – and an inside toilet. The original outside privy and washhouse can still be viewed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cottage</b> at 4 Chapel Row, Merthyr Tydfil, where Parry was born, is {{now open}} to the public as a museum. The row of cottages was {{attached}} to the Bethesda Chapel, where the family attended services. There are two bedrooms upstairs with the kitchen and another bedroom downstairs. The Parry family lived here with two lodgers until emigrating to the United States in 1854.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cottage</b> {{garden in}} France is a {{development}} of the early 20th century. Monet's garden at Giverny is a prominent example, a sprawling garden full of varied plantings, rich colors, and water gardens. In modern times, the term 'cottage garden' is used to describe any number of informal garden styles, using design and plants very different from their traditional English cottage garden origins. Examples include regional variations using a grass prairie scheme (in the American midwest) and California chaparral cottage gardens.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cottages</b> {{are built}} in brick in vernacular revival style with tiled hipped roofs. Each is {{a mirror image}} of the other and they share a central chimney stack; <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> are divided by a {{buttress}} in the lower storey. They have gables containing a lozenge pattern in <b>the</b> brickwork. Both <b>cottages</b> have rear extensions added in the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|Also {{built with}} the {{lighthouse}} was a sandstone keeper's cottage, also designed by Dawson. A second cottage {{was constructed in}} 1860, and two rooms were added to each of <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> in 1877. <b>The</b> <b>cottages</b> were connected to the city water only in 1897, using stored waters until then.|$|R

The yurts also sleep up to five in single or double bunks. They are a bit more modern than <b>the</b> <b>cottages.</b> Each yurt has a refrigerator and stove as well as tables, chairs and electric lights and heat.|$|R
5|$|The house {{known as}} the Jesse Ashbridge house {{was built on the}} family's land {{beginning}} in 1854. The house was designed for Sarah's grandson and Jonathan's son, Jesse Ashbridge, by prominent local architect, Joseph Sheard, who many years later would later serve as Mayor of Toronto. <b>The</b> <b>cottage</b> was designed in the Regency style, built with red brick laid in a Flemish bond, with a hipped roof and treillage veranda. Jesse married in 1864 and died in 1874.|$|E
5|$|Today <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> is {{run as a}} museum, {{having been}} granted {{official}} museum status in March 2000. It is open {{for much of the}} year and staffed by volunteers. The old pig sty and storage shed, deemed beyond repair, were demolished and the bricks used to construct a purpose-built visitor centre, used for exhibitions about Navenby and the local area.|$|E
5|$|A {{hallmark}} of the curriculum in the earliest days was study organized around major themes—trees, Shakespeare, Egypt and other subjects—that built over the school year into major class projects, performances, and all-school gatherings. Many of these themes and events have grown into lasting school traditions, with which the school community has come to identify each group and certain times of year. One the school's most cherished traditions, tapping maple trees to make syrup, began with the move to the new building in 1929. The Spring Fair, in which groups one through five each prepare and perform their own dance, has been held annually since the 1930s—the Maypole dance by the fifth group {{dates back to the}} beginning of <b>the</b> <b>Cottage</b> School.|$|E
