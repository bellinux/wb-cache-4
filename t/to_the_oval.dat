50|$|A multi-configuration road {{course is}} planned. The 3.2 km (2 mile) FIM/FIA track will {{incorporate}} <b>the</b> <b>oval</b> through tunnels {{in and out}} under the back straight of <b>the</b> <b>oval.</b> This design will be unique in providing a “stadium section” for the road course that will utilize the permanent seating of <b>the</b> <b>oval.</b> <b>The</b> elevations of the site will allow the spectators in <b>the</b> <b>oval</b> grandstand <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> <b>oval</b> section {{as well as the}} back section of the road course. A second configuration will separate from <b>the</b> <b>oval,</b> and use only the back section of <b>the</b> road course <b>to</b> allow <b>the</b> <b>oval</b> and back road course to be used independently. A 2nd paddock area will be built along <b>the</b> longest straight <b>to</b> accommodate <b>the</b> back course. The road course paddock area will also be the location of light industrial buildings for race teams and motorsport related shops.|$|R
5|$|After {{the match}} against Durham, Australia headed south <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Oval</b> for the Fifth Test, which started on 14 August. Barnes and Tallon {{returned}} from injury, while Ernie Toshack was omitted with knee troubles, and the leg spin of Doug Ring replaced Johnson's off spin. Overnight, hundreds of spectators had slept on wet pavements in rainy weather to queue for tickets. Bradman had already {{announced that he}} would retire {{at the end of the}} season, and the public were anxious to witness his last Test appearance.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{travelled}} <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Oval</b> for the Fifth Test. After taking {{only seven}} wickets at 61.00 {{in the four}} Tests, and being severely attacked in the previous match at Headingley, Johnson was dropped in favour of leg spinner Doug Ring. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. England were dismissed for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon with Ring not required to bowl, as the pacemen made light work of the hosts. Ring was economical in the second innings, taking 1/44 from 28 overs as Australia sealed the series 40 with another innings victory.|$|E
5|$|From 1882 to 1886, Glentoran used Ormeau Park {{as their}} home ground. They moved to Westbourne in Ballymacarrett {{for six years}} until 1892. They then moved <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Oval.</b> Initially it was on Dee Street, however in 1903 The Oval's pitch was rotated 90 degrees to its current location.

50|$|Along with Soldier Hollow and the Utah Olympic Park, <b>the</b> Utah Olympic <b>Oval</b> {{was built}} {{specifically}} for the 2002 Winter Olympics. On October 5, 1992, the Utah Sports Authority chose the Oquirrh Park Fitness Center in Kearns as the site for <b>the</b> 2002 Olympic <b>Oval,</b> beating out other locations in West Valley City, Sandy and downtown Salt Lake City. Funds from the 1989 Olympic referendum would be used <b>to</b> construct <b>the</b> <b>oval,</b> and would be repaid with profits from the games. The plans called for using $3.7 million of tax payer money <b>to</b> construct <b>the</b> <b>oval,</b> which would be an outdoor facility. If Salt Lake City won its 1995 bid for the 2002 games, Olympic funds would be used <b>to</b> cover <b>the</b> <b>oval,</b> and build an ice sheet {{in the center of}} the track. By the time the groundbreaking ceremony was held in May 1994, the price tag had increased to $4.1 million, with an expected completion date sometime that December. Because of cold temperatures and a wet spring, cement for <b>the</b> <b>oval</b> could not be poured, and <b>the</b> <b>oval</b> didn't open until September 1, 1995, almost a year behind schedule. <b>The</b> <b>oval</b> was formally dedicated in a ceremony, attended by Olympian Cathy Turner, on January 12, 1996. Prior to it being covered and used during the Olympic games, <b>the</b> <b>oval</b> would be used for inline skating during the summer and ice skating during the winter months.|$|R

In October 2007 he was honoured at the Pride of Britain Awards. Between his 110th and 111th birthdays Allingham made over 60 public appearances, including a visit <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Oval</b> on 5 June 2007, the day before his 111th birthday, where he was wheeled around the boundary {{in front of the}} spectators.|$|E
5|$|Claire's main storyline {{in season}} 2 is her advocacy, as Second Lady, for {{a sexual assault}} {{prevention}} bill. During her campaign for the bill a skeleton from her college days emerges: during a nationally televised interview, she admits that she was raped in college and that her rapist, Dalton McGinnis (Peter Bradbury), is now a high-ranking general. (She had earlier had an uncomfortable encounter with McGinnis at a White House dinner, during which she had told Frank what the general had done to her.) She also admits to having aborted a pregnancy that she claims {{was the result of}} the rape; it is later revealed that she in fact aborted Frank's child, with his consent. She then converts the focus on that issue into political support that becomes critical to the Underwoods' ascension <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> Office.|$|E
5|$|Francis {{spends most}} of the season as the newly {{appointed}} Vice President of the United States. In early episodes Frank vanquishes reporters on the trail of a murder he committed in the previous season. However, the drama soon shifts to tensions involving Frank, President Walker, the Chinese government, and the wealthy Raymond Tusk, eventually culminating in a bitter political war between Frank and Tusk. Frank's wife Claire publicly reveals that she was raped in college by a prominent general and pursues anti-rape legislation. The most significant new character is Jackie Sharp, Frank's successor as House Whip, who soon finds herself embroiled in Frank's plans. As the war between Frank and Tusk consumes the Presidency, things culminate in a scandal that leads to Walker resigning, Tusk being arrested, and Frank ascending <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> Office.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, North Melbourne {{moved its}} playing and {{training}} base from <b>the</b> Arden Street <b>Oval</b> <b>to</b> Coburg <b>Oval.</b> <b>The</b> move {{was intended to}} be permanent, with some initial negotiations seeking long-term leases for up to 40 years, but it was ultimately cancelled after only eight months, and North Melbourne returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Arden Street <b>Oval</b> in 1966.|$|R

5|$|In the 21st century, the Oval {{has been}} {{dilapidated}} and has required constant repairs to fulfill Health and Safety requirements for Glentoran to host its home matches there. In 2009, Glentoran's Irish Cup match against Limavady United was abandoned after the stadium's floodlight pylons started shaking {{in the high}} winds and the referee deemed it too dangerous for the match to continue. In 2012, after considering selling naming rights <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Oval,</b> Glentoran unveiled plans to move the club to a new stadium in the Titanic Quarter of Belfast. The Oval was sold to property developers in March 2003 for £4million. Glentoran's chairman suggested that the Oval might be redeveloped into social housing.|$|E
5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound to a second window (the oval window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>oval</b> window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations. Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|The teams {{proceeded}} <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Oval</b> for the Fifth Test. After England {{elected to}} bat, Miller bowled John Dewes {{with his second}} ball and then removed Jack Crapp without scoring, leaving England at 4/23. Miller ended with 2/5 as Lindwall (6/20) cut down the home team for 52. In his last Test innings for the summer, Miller scored five. Australia led by 337 on the first innings and Miller dismissed Hutton and Crapp to end with 2/22 as Australia won by an innings and took a 4–0 series win. Miller ended the Tests with 184runs at 26.28 and 13wickets at 23.15. He took eight catches.|$|E

5|$|A 1997 {{match against}} Coleraine was {{abandoned}} when Linfield fans hurled bottles onto the pitch after two Linfield players were sent off. In May 2005 there were disturbances in Dublin at the Setanta Cup final between Linfield and Shelbourne. In the same month, Linfield fans were banned from travelling <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> for a match against Glentoran, allegedly {{as a result}} of disturbances involving both sets of fans the previous month. However, Glentoran denied this was the reason behind the ban, citing health and safety regulations that forced them to close the away stand. In 2008, three Linfield fans were charged in a Dublin court with public order offences at a Setanta Cup match against St Patrick's Athletic, but were released. In November of the same year, Linfield player Conor Hagan was struck by a rocket that was fired from Cliftonville supporters in the crowd following Linfield's 2–1 defeat, and the following month riot police were called into Glentoran supporters in the Boxing Day match after Linfield had taken a 2–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{then headed}} <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Oval</b> for the Fifth Test. Barnes {{returned}} from injury, so Hassett {{returned to his}} customary position in the middle order. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Propelled by Lindwall's 6/20, the tourists skittled Yardley’s men for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon. With the score at 1/10, Bill Edrich attempted to hook a short ball from Bill Johnston. Edrich failed {{to get the ball}} {{in the middle of the}} bat and it looped up and travelled around 10m. Hassett caught the ball just behind square leg, diving sideways to get two hands to the ball. Soon after, Lindwall bounced Compton, resulting in an edge that appeared to be heading towards the slips cordon. However, the ball cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton through for a run, but his surprised partner was too busy watching the ball and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at third man, who waited for Compton to regain his bat and composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to effect the run out. However, Compton only made four before being dismissed, so Australia lost little from Hassett's sportsmanship.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{then headed}} <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Oval</b> for the Fifth Test. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. England were {{dismissed}} for 52 in 42.1 overs {{on the first}} afternoon; Loxton bowled only two overs for one run as the frontline pacemen made light work of the hosts. His other notable action in the field occurred when Len Hutton the first runs of the match, a single in the first over. This had almost turned into a five when Loxton fired in a wide return, but Barnes managed to prevent from going for four overthrows. Loxton came in {{on the second day}} with the score at 5/265 and accompanied the centurion Morris for 39 further runs before Edrich had him caught behind for 15. He appeared uncomfortable with the outswingers and leg cutters of Bedser, and was beaten several times, before Edrich dismissed him. Australia ended at 389. Loxton was economical in the second innings, taking 0/16 from 10 overs as Australia dismissed the hosts for 188 to seal the series 4–0 with another innings victory.|$|E

40|$|Jupiter now has {{a second}} red spot, <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> BA. <b>The</b> first red spot, the Great Red Spot (GRS), is at least 180 yr old. <b>The</b> <b>Oval</b> BA formed in 2000 was {{originally}} white, but part turned red in 2005. Unlike the Great Red Spot, the red color of <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> BA is confined <b>to</b> an annulus. <b>The</b> <b>Oval’s</b> horizontal velocity and shape and the elevation of the haze layer above it were unchanged between 2000 and 2006. These observations, coupled with Jupiter’s rapid rotation and stratification, are shown <b>to</b> imply that <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> BA’s 3 D properties, such as its vertical thickness, were also unchanged. Therefore, neither a change in size nor velocity caused <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> BA <b>to</b> turn partially red. An atmospheric warming can account for both {{the timing of the}} color change of <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> BA as well as the persistent confinement of its red color to an annulus.

5|$|The teams {{proceeded}} <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Oval</b> for the Fifth Test. England {{elected to}} bat on a rain-affected pitch. Dewes and Hutton opened for England. Dewes took a single from Lindwall's opening over and thus faced {{the start of}} the second over, which was bowled by Miller, who had troubled him in the past and dismissed him several times. During his short innings, Dewes was visibly nervous and kept on moving around, unable to stand still. Miller caused a stoppage after his first ball to sprinkle sawdust on the slippery and damp crease. With his second ball, he bowled Dewes—who was playing across the line—middle stump for one with an inswinger to leave England at 1/2. He then removed Jack Crapp caught behind from an outside edge for a 23-ball duck, leaving England at 4/23 as play was adjourned for lunch. The paceman ended with 2/5 from eight overs; Lindwall took 6/20 and England were all out for 52. In his last Test innings for the summer, Miller scored five before overbalancing and being stumped. Australia made 389 and led by 337 on the first innings on the second afternoon. Bowling for the second time, Miller struck Crapp {{in the head with a}} bouncer, before bowling him for nine. He then extracted an edge from Hutton—who fell for 64, having top-scored in both innings—to wicket-keeper Tallon, leaving England at 4/153. Miller ended with 2/22 as Australia won by an innings and took a 4–0 series win.|$|E
