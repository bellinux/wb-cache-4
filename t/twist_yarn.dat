50|$|Weaving {{is done on}} a loom. There are {{two types}} of loom, the {{horizontal}} loom used by men and the vertical loom used by women. Traditionally most of the weaving is done by women. A continuous warp thread gives a solid color background for the motifs. A two color warp background is also used which produces a blended color effect. An iridescent color effect can also be produced when the warp is one color and the base weft (as opposed to decorative motive weft) another. Fabrics are woven to be single faced or double faced, that is the motifs show on both sides. Base fabric is mostly low <b>twist</b> <b>yarn</b> cotton, with the decorative motifs consisting of coarser or heavier spun cotton, low twist silk, or shiny rayon. Cotton and rayon combinations give a multicolored, brocaded look. Earth colors seem to predominate traditionally, but the contemporary access to imported dyes and colored cotton thread has broadened the spectrum.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{report that}} a {{prestressing}} technique {{similar to that}} traditionally used in prestressed concrete can improve the mechanical performance of flax fibre spun yarn reinforced polymer-matrix composites. Prestressing a low <b>twist</b> <b>yarn</b> not only introduces tension to the constituent fibres and compressive stress to the matrix similar as in prestressed concretes, but also causes changes to the yarn structure {{that lead to the}} rearrangement of fibres within the yarn. Prestressing increases the fibre packing density in yarn, causes fibre straightening, and reduces fibre obliquity in yarn (improved fibre alignment along yarn axis). All these changes contribute positively to the mechanical properties of the natural fibre yarn reinforced composites. Crow...|$|E

A range of yarn count with similar low twist was spun on ring machine with 70 / 30 and 30 / 70 PE/CT blend ratios. The yarn properties such as evenness, hairiness and strength were studied.

Imperfections were also found to be minimum with normal spinning condition and increased with increase in spindle air pressure.

40|$|Abstract: Yarn {{hairiness}} is one {{of important}} yarn parameters, which is used for yarn production quality control. It is usually characterized {{by the amount of}} free fibers (fibre loops, fibre ends) protruding from the compact yarn body towards the outer yarn surface. The first question can be if hairiness is really important and why? The reason is obtaining deeper information about yarn structure and its changes during processing. Thanks to detailed knowledge it is possible predict to yarn behaviour and design fabric and textile products precisely in the way the customers demand. Yarn hairiness and its determining is important because it influences the post spinning operation and parameters of textile product (porosity, permeability, transport of moisture, comfort, aesthetic properties and hand). The main factors influencing hairiness are: type of fibres, yarn <b>twist,</b> <b>yarn</b> count, blending ratio, yarn technology production, approach to yarn hairiness observation and measurement condition. This paper concentrates on the influence of yarn construction parameter (yarn count, yarn twist) and technology of production (ring comb and carded, experimental and open end). In this case, the Uster Tester 4 and the new optical approach for yarn hairiness investigation is applied. Results for experimental sets of yarn will be shown...|$|E

40|$|Cotton {{knitted fabrics}} were {{manufactured}} with different yarn types (conventional ring spun yarn and torque-free ring spun yarn) with different fibre types (combed cotton and combed Supima cotton) and yarn fineness (Ne 30 and Ne 40). These fabrics were then dyed with {{three types of}} dye (reactive, direct and sulphur dye) with three dye concentrations (0. 1 %, 1. 0 % and 5. 0 % on-weight of fabric (owf)) in three colours (red, yellow and blue). This study examined the impact of constructional parameters and dyeing on ultraviolet (UV) protection properties of cotton knitted fabric. In-vitro test with spectrophotometer was used for evaluating the UV protection property of dyed cotton knitted fabrics. Among the six parameters investigated, fineness of yarn and dye concentration were the most significant factors affecting UPF while the color effect is the least significant. Experimental results revealed that the UPF value of dyed fabrics made from combed cotton is generally higher than the combed Supima cotton since combed cotton is composed of shorter fibres which facilitate the blocking or absorption of UV radiation. Second, fabrics made with <b>twist</b> <b>yarn</b> (i. e. ring spun yarn) have higher UPF value than the corresponding ESTex one (i. e. Torque-free yarn) in general since fabrics made with ring spun yarn tend to shrink during wet processing {{and so it is}} more compact. Third, the UPF value of fabrics made with 30 Ne yarn was higher than the 40 Ne one since it is thicker and has lower fabric porosity. Fourth, fabrics dyed with lower concentration of dye gave the lowest UPF. Fifth, the sulphur dyed samples performed worse than the reactive and direct dyed samples in terms of UV protection property. Sixth, there is no significant difference in UPF for red, yellow and blue coloured fabrics. Seventh, this study also demonstrated that lightness of fabric is negatively related to UV protection property. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Twenty-four woven Pre-Columbian {{textiles}} in the Apparel, Interiors and Merchandising Department (AIM) of Oregon State University {{were reported}} to be from Ancon, Peru. A methodology was developed to confirm the exact provenance of the AIM textiles. Technical fabrication characteristics were utilized to describe certain known Ancon woven textiles and to analyze the twenty-four AIM textiles; then comparisons were attempted {{between the two groups}} to determine if internal patterns for each were identical. A literature and collection survey identified ten documented reports of known Ancon woven textiles. The previously recorded information of the known Ancon pieces was summarized. Technical fabrication characteristics for each AIM textile were observed and recorded. The technical fabrication characteristics included weave structure, thread count, fiber content, direction of spin, ply, degree of <b>twist,</b> <b>yarn</b> diameter, color and motif. Frequencies and especially developed analysis tools were utilized to identify internal patterns. Hypothesis 1 stated that information about the technical fabrication elements of Ancon woven textiles in certain other collections can be organized into integrated patterns. Hypothesis 1 was not supported because data recorded on Ancon woven textiles was incomplete, and therefore only able to give limited frequencies. Hypothesis 2 was supported: The twenty-four woven Pre-Columbian textiles from the Costume and Textile Collection of the Apparel, Interiors and Merchandising Department of Oregon State University will have similar patterns in technical fabrication elements. An analysis tool was developed to show patterns within technical fabrication elements. Thread count, direction of spin, ply, and degree of twist exhibited internal patterns. Hypothesis 3 stated that the provenance of twenty-four woven Pre-Columbian textiles, from the Costume and Textile Collection of the Apparel, Interiors and Merchandising Department of Oregon State University is Ancon, Peru. This hypothesis could not be tested because technical fabrication patterns for the known Ancon weavings were not complete and could not be statistically analyzed. Even though the two sets of data populations (data from known Ancon textiles and data from the AIM collection) could not be compared statistically, some information was gained by a review and comparison of simple frequencies of internal patterns.

40|$|During yarn {{formation}} by ring spinning, fibres {{are bent}} into approximately helical shapes and an unbalanced torque or twist-liveliness is created. Generally, the torque depends on yarn geometric {{factors such as}} the <b>yarn</b> <b>twist</b> and linear density and the fibre properties. In order to prevent the instability of yarn (e. g., snarling), twist-liveliness must be controlled. A practical {{solution to the problem of}} twist-liveliness is the formation of a two-fold <b>yarn.</b> This <b>twisting</b> or plying process produces a yarn structure where the energy of the system is determined by purely geometrical constraints of the plied structure and consequently when an energy minimum is reached the plied yarn obtained from the process is torsionally balanced and torque-free.
