5|$|The {{question}} of Maria Theresa's marriage was raised {{early in her}} childhood.

5|$|At {{the age of}} 29, Michael Johnson {{was engaged}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>married</b> <b>to</b> a local woman, Mary Neild, but she {{cancelled}} the engagement. Twenty years later, in 1706, he married Sarah Ford. She came from a middle-class milling and farming family and was twelve years his junior, daughter of Cornelius Ford. Although both families had money, Samuel Johnson often claimed that {{he grew up in}} poverty. It is uncertain what happened between the marriage of his parents and Samuel's birth three years later to provoke a decline in the family's fortunes, but Michael Johnson quickly became overwhelmed with debt from which he was never able to recover.|$|E
5|$|B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani signed L. V. Prasad {{to direct}} a bilingual film for Vijaya Vauhini Studios. The film's script, by Chakrapani, was based on Rabindranath Maitra's Manmoyee Girls School and Sharadindu Bandhopadhyay's Detective. Chakrapani thought the plot of Manmoyee Girls School, about two {{unemployed}} young people who pretend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>married</b> <b>to</b> gain employment and fall in love, was too limited for a full-length film. He added the basic storyline of Detective, in which an enthusiastic detective finds a missing woman and marries her. Prasad's relationship with Khan, a Muslim tailor near Kohinoor Studios in Bombay (now Mumbai), was {{the basis of the}} film's friendship between two men of different religions. The film was titled Missamma in Telugu and Missiamma in Tamil.|$|E

5|$|The couple met at Liège before {{travelling}} to Utrecht where, on 10 April, {{they became}} officially betrothed. On 25 July Matilda was crowned Queen of the Romans {{in a ceremony}} at Mainz. There was a considerable age gap between the couple, as Matilda was only eight years old while Henry was 24. After the betrothal she was placed into the custody of Bruno, the Archbishop of Trier, who was tasked with educating her in German culture, manners and government. In January 1114 Matilda was ready <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>married</b> <b>to</b> Henry, and their wedding {{was held at the}} city of Worms amid extravagant celebrations.

Meanwhile, Tabitha's father Darrin Stephens (Dick Sargent), {{who works at}} an advertising agency, fails to land a million-dollar account with toy company owner Mr. Brockway (Parley Baer) because Mr. Brockway is racist and incorrectly believes Darrin <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>married</b> <b>to</b> Lisa's mother Dorothy (Janee Michelle). In an attempt to convince Mr. Brockway to overcome his bigotry, Darrin's wife Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery), who is a witch, casts a spell on Mr. Brockway so he sees everyone, including himself, as having black skin.|$|E

5|$|Alvarez's sister, Gladys, {{worked for}} Ernest Lawrence as a {{part-time}} secretary, and mentioned Alvarez to Lawrence. Lawrence then invited Alvarez to tour the Century of Progress exhibition in Chicago with him. After he completed his oral exams in 1936, Alvarez, now engaged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>married</b> <b>to</b> Geraldine Smithwick, asked his sister to see if Lawrence had any jobs available at the Radiation Laboratory. A telegram soon arrived from Gladys with a job offer from Lawrence. This started a long association with the University of California, Berkeley. Alvarez and Smithwick were married {{in one of the}} chapels at the University of Chicago and then headed for California. They had two children, Walter and Jean. They were divorced in 1957. On December 28, 1958, he married Janet L. Landis, and had two more children, Donald and Helen.|$|E
5|$|During William's absence {{a crisis}} had {{developed}} in Jerusalem. King Baldwin {{had reached the}} age of majority in 1176 and Raymond III had been removed from the regency, but as a leper Baldwin could have no children and could not be expected to rule much longer. After the death of William of Montferrat in 1177, King Baldwin's widowed sister Sibylla required a new husband. At Easter in 1180, the two factions were divided even further when Raymond and his cousin Bohemond III of Antioch attempted to force Sibylla to marry Baldwin of Ibelin. Raymond and Bohemond were King Baldwin's nearest male relatives in the paternal line, and could have claimed the throne if the king died without an heir or a suitable replacement. Before Raymond and Bohemond arrived, however, Agnes and King Baldwin arranged for Sibylla <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>married</b> <b>to</b> a Poitevin newcomer, Guy of Lusignan, whose older brother Aimery of Lusignan was already an established figure at court.|$|E

5|$|Sviatoslav enthusiastically {{agreed to}} the Byzantine proposal. In August 967 or 968, the Rus' crossed the Danube into Bulgarian territory, {{defeated}} a Bulgarian army of 30,000 men in the Battle of Silistra, and occupied most of the Dobruja. According to the Bulgarian historian Vasil Zlatarski, Sviatoslav seized 80towns in northeastern Bulgaria. They were looted and destroyed but not permanently occupied. Tsar Peter I suffered an epileptic stroke when he received news of the defeat. The Rus' wintered at Pereyaslavets, while the Bulgarians retreated to the fortress of Dorostolon (Silistra). The next year, Sviatoslav left with part of his army to counter a Pecheneg attack on his capital at Kiev (incited either by the Byzantines or, according to the Russian Primary Chronicle, by the Bulgarians). At the same time, Tsar Peter sent a new embassy to Byzantium, a visit that was recorded by Liutprand of Cremona. In contrast to their previous reception, this time the Bulgarian envoys were treated with great honour. Nevertheless, Nikephoros, confident of his position, demanded harsh terms: Tsar Peter was to resign and be replaced by Boris, and the two young emperors, Basil and Constantine, were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>married</b> <b>to</b> Bulgarian princesses, daughters of Boris.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch, {{concerned}} about Amir's nationalistic tendencies, convinced the Sultan {{to send him}} back to Langkat, an order which the fledgling poet was unable to refuse. In 1937, Amir, together {{with two of the}} Sultan's vassals tasked with escorting him, boarded the Opten Noort from Tanjung Priok and returned to Sumatra. Upon arriving in Langkat, he was informed that he was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>married</b> <b>to</b> the Sultan's eldest daughter, Tengku Puteri Kamiliah, a woman he had barely met. Before the wedding Amir returned to Batavia to face his final exam– and have one last meeting with Sundari. Several weeks later he returned to Langkat, where he and Kamiliah were married in an extravagant ceremony. His cousin, Tengku Burhan, later stated that Amir's indifference throughout the seven-day event was due to his thinking of Sundari.|$|E
5|$|Mariam {{lives in}} a kolba on the {{outskirts}} of Herat with her embittered mother. Jalil, her father, is a wealthy businessman who owns a cinema and lives in the town with three wives and nine children. Mariam is his illegitimate daughter, and she is prohibited to live with them, but Jalil visits her every Thursday. On her fifteenth birthday, Mariam wants her father to take her to see Pinocchio at his movie theater, against the pleas of her mother. When he does not show up, she hikes into town and goes to his house. He refuses to see her, and she ends up sleeping on the street. In the morning, Mariam returns home to find that her mother has committed suicide out of fear that her daughter had deserted her. Mariam is then taken to live in her father's house. Jalil arranges for her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>married</b> <b>to</b> Rasheed, a shoemaker from Kabul who is thirty-years her senior. In Kabul, Mariam becomes pregnant seven successive times, but is never able to carry a child to term. This is a sad, disquieting reality for both Rasheed and Mariam. Ultimately Rasheed grows more and more despondent over his wife's inability to have a child and particularly a son. As their marriage wears on Rasheed gradually becomes more and more abusive.|$|E

5|$|Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, {{was one of}} Elizabeth's leading statesmen, {{involved}} in domestic as well as foreign politics alongside William Cecil and Francis Walsingham. Although he refused <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>married</b> <b>to</b> Mary, Queen of Scots, Dudley {{was for a long}} time relatively sympathetic to her until, from the mid-1580s, he strongly advocated for her execution. As patron of the Puritan movement, he supported non-conforming preachers but tried to mediate between them and the bishops of the Church of England. A champion also of the international Protestant cause, he led the English campaign in support of the Dutch Revolt (1585–87). His acceptance of the post of Governor-General of the United Provinces infuriated Queen Elizabeth. The expedition was a military and political failure, and it ruined the Earl financially. Leicester was engaged in many large-scale business ventures {{and was one of the}} main backers of Francis Drake and other explorers and privateers. During the Spanish Armada, the Earl was in overall command of the English land forces. In this function, he invited Queen Elizabeth to visit her troops at Tilbury. This was the last of many events he had organised over the years, the most spectacular being the festival at his seat Kenilworth Castle in 1575 on occasion of a three-week visit by the Queen. Dudley was a principal patron of the arts, literature, and the Elizabethan theatre.|$|E
