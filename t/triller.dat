'I trillirt the knaves right well,' {{was honest}} George's {{way of telling}} the story of his exploit, not only a brave one, but amounting even to self-devotion when we {{remember}} that the robber baron was his near neighbour, and a terror to all around. The word <b>Triller</b> took the place of his surname, and when the sole reward he asked was leave freely to cut wood in the forest, the Elector gave him a piece of land of his own in the parish of Eversbach. In 1855 there was a grand celebration of the rescue of the Saxon princes on the 9th of July, the four hundredth anniversary, with a great procession of foresters and charcoal-burners to the 'Triller's Brewery', which stands where George's hut and kiln were once placed.

50|$|The <b>trillers</b> (Lalage) are a genus of {{passerine}} birds {{belonging to}} the cuckoo-shrike family Campephagidae. Their name comes from the loud trilling calls of the males.

They build a neat cup-shaped nest high in a tree.|$|R
50|$|White-winged <b>trillers</b> {{are fairly}} common in woodland, and open scrub {{through most of}} their range, and close to riverbeds in the central arid zone.

5000|$|The {{alveolar}} trill [...] {{is one of}} {{the most}} difficult sounds to be produced in Spanish and as a result is acquired later in development. Research suggests that the alveolar trill is acquired and developed between the ages of three and six years. Some children acquire an adult-like trill within this period and some fail to properly acquire the trill. The attempted trill sound of the poor <b>trillers</b> is often perceived as a series of taps owing to hyperactive tongue movement during production.|$|R

50|$|On a paper {{report on}} the survey {{conducted}} on the island on 16-20 July 1990. A total of 18 species of birds representing 7 orders and 15 families have been identified and reported. The most common species observed were glossy swiftlets (Collocalia esculenta), white-collared kingfishers (Halcyon chloris), pied <b>trillers</b> (Lalage nigra), black-naped orioles (Oriolus chinensis), Philippine mapgie robins (Copsychus saularis), Malaysia fantails (Rhipidura javanica), white-breasted woodswallows (Artamus leucorhynchus), glossy starlings (Aplonis panayensis), yellow-breasted sunbirds (Nectarinia jugularis) and Eurasian tree sparrows (Passer montanus). For {{the rest of the}} species either only one or two individuals were seen or only either calls were heard.|$|R
50|$|Information {{about the}} {{breeding}} {{of this family}} is incomplete, with many species having never been studied. In all the species studied the cuckooshrikes are territorial; in species that do not migrate these territories are maintained year round. Cuckooshrikes are monogamous, with the pair bonds apparently lasting throughout the year. Only one instance of non-monogamous breeding has been recorded, an instance of polygyny in white-winged <b>trillers</b> in Australia, where one male aided two females in raising their young. Several species of cuckooshrike exhibit cooperative breeding. About four blotchy white, green or blue eggs are laid in a cup nest in a tree. Incubation is about two weeks.|$|R
50|$|The cuckooshrikes {{and allies}} in the family Campephagidae are small to {{medium-sized}} passerine bird species found in the subtropical and tropical Africa, Asia and Australasia. The roughly 86 species are found in eight (or nine) genera which comprise five distinct groups, the 'true' cuckooshrikes (Campephaga, Coracina, Lobotos, Pteropodocys and Campochaera) the <b>trillers</b> (Lalage), the minivets (Pericrocotus), the flycatcher-shrikes (Hemipus) comprise a total of 316 taxa. The woodshrikes (Tephrodornis) were often considered {{to be in this}} family but are probably better placed in their own family, Tephrodornithidae, along with the philentomas and the flycatcher-shrikes. Another genus, Chlamydochaera, which has one species, the black-breasted fruithunter, was often placed in this family but has now been shown to be a thrush (Turdidae).|$|R

40|$|Huge aggregations of flightless locust nymphs pose {{a serious}} threat to {{agriculture}} when they reach plague proportions but provide a very visible and nutritious resource for native birds. Locust outbreaks occur in spring and summer months in semiarid regions of Australia. Fenitrothion, an organophosphate pesticide, is sprayed aerially to control locust plagues. To evaluate fenitrothion exposure in birds attending locust outbreaks, we measured total plasma cholinesterase (ChE), butrylcholinesterase (BChE), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities in four avian species captured pre- and postfenitrothion application and ChE reactivation in birds caught postspray only. Eleven of 21 plasma samples from four species had ChE activity below the diagnostic threshold (two standard deviations below the mean ChE activity of prespray samples). Granivorous zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) and insectivorous white-winged <b>trillers</b> (Lalage sueurii) had significantly lower mean plasma total ChE, BChE, and AChE activity postspray, while other insectivores, white-browed (Artamus superciliosus) and masked woodswallows (Artamus personatus), did not. Cholinesterase was reactivated in 19 of the 73 plasma samples and in one of three brain samples. We conclude that native bird species are exposed to fenitrothion during locust control operations. This exposure could have detrimental impacts, as both locust outbreaks and avian reproductive events are stimulated by heavy summer rainfall, leading to co-occurrence of locust control and avian breeding activities. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Context: Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.) is an {{introduced}} pasture {{grass that}} has spread over {{large areas of}} semiarid Australia with potentially significant negative consequences for biodiversity. Previous {{studies suggest that the}} response of bird communities to the changes in habitat associated with buffel grass invasion is complex. Aims: This study compares the behaviour of birds between sub-sites with predominantly native vegetation where buffel grass had been removed and control sub-sites with buffel grass, which were left unmanaged, at two locations in central Australia. Our objective was to evaluate whether removing buffel grass at small scales had measurable benefits for local bird species and to better understand how the presence of buffel grass affects bird behaviour. Methods: We assessed differences in microhabitat use and behaviour of all species combined and when separated into above ground, flexible and ground foraging guilds. We also tested for direct correlations between different cover types and the microhabitat use and behaviour of birds within guilds, with some further analyses of three common species individually. Key results: Management of buffel grass was associated with changes in the microhabitat use and behaviour of birds when all species were combined and for all foraging guilds. Buffel grass cover was negatively correlated with the proportional time birds spent on the ground and with proportional time spent foraging. However, of the three species examined individually only the behaviour of white-winged <b>trillers</b> (Lalage tricolor) was consistently correlated with ground vegetation cover. Our observations also suggest birds spent less time overall at sites with high buffel grass. Conclusions: Managing buffel grass in small areas creates islands of habitat that provide important opportunities for foraging at a localised scale. Buffel grass and other ground cover affects the behaviour of birds collectively, but individual species responses vary. Implications: Management of buffel grass in small areas with high conservation value should be considered. Our study will help to inform land managers of the benefits of controlling buffel grass on a localised scale...|$|R
