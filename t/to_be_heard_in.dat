5|$|The last operatic music <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> the {{old house}} had been the finale of Falstaff, {{conducted}} by Solti with the singers led by Bryn Terfel, in a joint opera and ballet farewell gala in July 1997. When the house reopened in December 1999, magnificently restored, Falstaff was the opera given on the opening night, conducted by Haitink, once more with Terfel in the title role.|$|E
5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E

25|$|Ahatallah {{was never}} heard from again in India, and rumours soon spread that Archbishop Garcia had {{disposed}} of him before he ever reached Goa.

In reality, it appears that Ahatallah did in fact reach Goa, from whence he was sent on to Europe, but he evidently died in Paris before reaching Rome where his case was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard.</b> <b>In</b> any event, Garcia's dismissiveness towards the Saint Thomas Christians' appeals only embittered the community further.|$|E

25|$|Many issues {{damage the}} {{relationship}} of science {{to the media and}} the use of science and scientific arguments by politicians. As a very broad generalisation, many politicians seek certainties and facts whilst scientists typically offer probabilities and caveats. However, politicians' ability <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> the mass media frequently distorts the scientific understanding by the public. Examples in the United Kingdom include the controversy over the MMR inoculation, and the 1988 forced resignation of a Government Minister, Edwina Currie, for revealing the high probability that battery farmed eggs were contaminated with Salmonella.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} to the Cave of Bats (Cueva de Río Murciélagos) lies 75meters to the northwest of the BatPalace. Although relatively dry in the dry season, after rainfall water can pour out through the cave mouth {{at a rate of}} 8m³/second, creating enough noise <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> the main plaza 500meters away. Although the seasonal flow of water has washed away almost all archaeological remains from the cave, archaeologists consider that the Cave of Bats was of ceremonial importance to the inhabitants of DosPilas due to the dramatic torrent that flows through it in the wet season.|$|E
25|$|In January, 1845, a {{sizeable}} group of supporters gathered at Marlboro Chapel in Boston and resolved to provide Parker “a chance <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> Boston.” Calling themselves “Friends of Theodore Parker,” they hired a hall and {{invited him to}} preach there on Sunday mornings. Despite misgivings, Parker accepted and preached his first sermon at the Melodean Theater in February. Although the arrangement was temporary at first, he resigned his West Roxbury pastorate in early 1846 (to the dismay of his faithful parishioners there). He elected to call his new congregation the 28th Congregational Society of Boston.|$|E

25|$|The Government {{appealed the}} SCA's ruling to the Constitutional Court, arguing {{that a major}} {{alteration}} to {{the institution of marriage}} was for Parliament and not the courts to decide, while Fourie and Bonthuys cross-appealed, arguing that the Marriage Act should be altered as Judge Farlam had suggested. In the meanwhile, the Lesbian and Gay Equality Project had also launched a separate lawsuit directly attacking the constitutionality of the Marriage Act, which was originally <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> the Johannesburg High Court; the Constitutional Court granted the Project's request to have it heard and decided simultaneously with the Fourie case.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{designed}} by Mardas, of Apple Electronics, the initial installation {{proved to be}} unworkable − with almost no standard studio features such as a patch bay, or a talkback system between the studio and the control room, let alone Alex's promised innovations − {{and had to be}} scrapped. Nevertheless, the Beatles recorded and filmed portions of their album Let It Be in the Apple Studio, with equipment borrowed from EMI; during takes they had to shut down the building's central heating, also located in the basement, because the lack of soundproofing allowed the heating system <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> the studio.|$|E
25|$|For civil matters, {{the repeal}} of section56A means that the Subordinate Courts Act no longer {{stipulates}} that constitutional questions must be referred to the High Court. However, this continues to be necessary in Magistrate's Court proceedings because these courts lack jurisdiction to deal with constitutional questions, as mentioned above. Assuming that declarations can be sought from District Courts, decisions {{that have been made}} by these courts may be appealed to the High Court and the Court of Appeal in the usual manner. Alternatively, a party apply to the High Court for the constitutional question <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> a separate action.|$|E

This organization gives legal and psychological support to Taiwanese comfort women, and also helps in the recording of testimony and doing scholarly research. In 2007, this organization was responsible for promoting awareness in society, by creating meetings in universities and high schools where survivors gave their testimonies to students and the general public.

25|$|This Act {{was passed}} by 78–71 in December 2010 in partial {{response}} to the 2008–2010 Irish banking crisis. Section 60 provides that the Irish government may apply to the courts for an order made under the Act <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> private. Section 59 prohibits anyone from publishing {{the fact that the}} minister has made an order or direction under the Act; even publication that such a prohibition order has been made is also an offence under the Act. Days after the Act was passed, an order was sought by minister Brian Lenihan, Jnr and approved allowing a transfer of over €3,700,000,000 into Allied Irish Bank, then an insolvent bank. Two Irish Times reporters were expelled from the court by judge Maureen Clark just before the hearing.|$|E
25|$|The EU non-automatic {{weighing}} instrument directive (directive 2009/23/EEC), which came into force in 2009 codified existing regulations regarding the harmonisation of non-automatic weighing devices used for trade, medical purposes or {{in the preparation of}} evidence <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> court. The directive identified four classes of weighing device ranging from Class I (having a minimum accuracy of 1 part in 50,000) to class IIII (having a minimum accuracy of 1 part in 100). Devices that fall within the scope of the directive are required to be recalibrated at regular intervals and to have an output showing SI units, except for those used for weighing precious metals or stones. Secondary indications may be shown, provided that they cannot be mistaken for primary indications.|$|E
