60|$|From the {{constitution}} {{as a whole}} the candidate next proceeded to extol <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> <b>feature</b> of it that {{was known as the}} borough of Householder. According to his account of this portion of the government, its dwellers were animated by the noblest spirit of independence, the most rooted determination to uphold the ministry of which he was the least worthy member, and were distinguished by what in an ecstasy of political eloquence he happily termed the most freeborn understanding of its rights and privileges. This loyal and judicious borough had never been known to waste its favors on those who had not a stake in the community. It understood that fundamental principle of good government which lays down the axiom that none were to be trusted but those who had a visible and an extended interest in the country; for without these pledges of honesty and independence what had the elector to expect but bribery and corruption--a traffic in his dearest rights, and a bargaining that might destroy the glorious institutions under which he dwelt. This part of the harangue was listened to in respectful silence, and shortly after the orator concluded; when the electors dispersed, with, no doubt, a better opinion of themselves and {{the constitution}} than it had probably been their good fortune to entertain since the previous election.|$|E
60|$|This {{investigation}} {{places in}} a strong light the value and efficacy of the Joint Method. For, as we have already seen, the defect of that Method is, that like the Method of Agreement, {{of which it is}} only an improved form, it can not prove causation. But in the present case (as in one of the steps in the argument which led up to it) causation is already proved; since there could never be any doubt that the rigidity altogether, and the putrefaction which follows it, are caused by the fact of death: the observations and experiments on which this rests are too familiar to need analysis, and fall under the Method of Difference. It being, therefore, beyond doubt that the aggregate antecedent, the death, is the actual cause of the whole train of consequents, whatever of the circumstances attending the death can be shown to be followed in all its variations by variations in the effect under investigation, must be <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> <b>feature</b> of the fact of death on which that effect depends. The degree of muscular irritability at the time of death fulfills this condition. The only point that could be brought into question, would be whether the effect depended on the irritability itself, or on something which always accompanied the irritability: and this doubt is set at rest by establishing, as the instances do, that by whatever cause the high or low irritability is produced, the effect equally follows; and can not, therefore, depend upon the causes of irritability, nor upon the other effects of those causes, which are as various as the causes themselves, but upon the irritability, solely.|$|E

50|$|Epoxide docosapentaenoic acids (epoxydocosapentaenoic acids, EDPs, or EpDPEs) are {{metabolites}} of the 22-carbon straight-chain {{omega-3 fatty}} acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Cell types that express certain cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases metabolize polyunsaturated fatty acid's (PUFAs) by converting {{one of their}} double bonds to an epoxide. In {{the best known of}} these metabolic pathways, cellular CYP epoxygenases metabolize the 20-carbon straight-chain omega-6 fatty acid, arachidonic acid, to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs); another CYP epoxygenase pathway metabolizes the 20-carbon omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), to epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EEQs). CYP epoxygenases similarly convert various other PUFAs to epoxides (see epoxygenase) These epoxide metabolites have a variety of activities. However, essentially all of them are rapidly converted to their corresponding, but in general far less active, Vicinal (chemistry) dihydroxy fatty acids by ubiquitous cellular Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH; also termed Epoxide hydrolase 2). Consequently, these epoxides, including EDPs, operate as short-lived signaling agents that regulate the function of their parent or nearby cells. <b>The</b> <b>particular</b> <b>feature</b> of EDPs (and EEQs) distinguishing them from EETs is that they derive from omega-3 fatty acids and are suggested to be responsible for some of the beneficial effects attributed to omega-3 fatty acids and omega-3-rich foods such as fish oil.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the field}} of {{computer}} vision feature matching in high dimensional feature spaces is a commonly used technique for object recognition. One major problem is to find an adequate similarity measure for <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> <b>feature</b> space, as there is usually only little knowledge about the structure of that space. As a possible {{solution to this problem}} this paper presents a method to obtain a similarity measure suitable for the task of feature matching without the need for structural information of <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> <b>feature</b> space. As the described similarity measure is based on the topology of the feature space and the topology is generated by a growing neural gas, no knowledge about the particular structure of the feature space is needed. In addition, the used neural gas quantizes the feature vectors and thus reduces the amount of data which has to be stored and retrieved for the purpose of object recognition. ...|$|E
