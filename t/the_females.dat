5|$|A {{recent study}} shows that both food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides <b>the</b> <b>females</b> with more time {{to care for the}} nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time <b>the</b> <b>females</b> spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the male}} and female of the species reach sexual {{maturity}} after 1 year of life. The breeding season occurs in the spring and early summer. The males arrive before {{the beginning of the season}} to establish their territories. The males use a series of courtship displays to attract <b>the</b> <b>females</b> to their sites. They run around the area either to showcase their territory to <b>the</b> <b>females</b> or to pursue <b>the</b> <b>females.</b> The males also engage in flight to showcase their wings. They sing and call as they perform all of these displays. The species can remain monogamous for many years, but incidents of polygyny and bigamy have been reported to occur during the bird's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{observed}} that the males of some species, such as birds of paradise, were very different from <b>the</b> <b>females.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>female</b> {{southern}} double-collared sunbird has brown upperparts and yellowish-grey underparts. The juvenile resembles <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> <b>The</b> <b>female</b> is greyer below than <b>the</b> <b>female</b> orange-breasted sunbird, {{and darker}} below than <b>the</b> <b>female</b> dusky sunbird.|$|R
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>female</b> is {{receptive}} {{then she}} will run {{in front of}} the male a few steps then freeze her body. <b>The</b> <b>female</b> when then exhibit lordosis behavior. In response, the male will typically groom <b>the</b> <b>female</b> hamster's rear, then mount <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> Mating lasts several seconds. After mating, the male may groom himself or <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> Then he will mount <b>the</b> <b>female</b> again. <b>The</b> mating pair should be left to repeat this for 20-30 minutes or until one of the hamsters loses interest.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>female</b> is flightless, {{spending}} her brief life {{attached to}} her cocoon. <b>The</b> <b>female</b> attracts other males via release of a pheromone, the males find <b>the</b> <b>female</b> via <b>the</b> concentration gradient of the released pheromeone. <b>The</b> <b>female</b> mates and lays her grey-yellow eggs in large numbers on her fine-meshed cocoon.|$|R
5|$|Fertilised female wasps {{enter the}} {{receptive}} 'fig' (the syconium) through a tiny {{hole at the}} crown (the ostiole). They crawl around the inflorescenced interior of the fig, pollinating some of the female flowers, before laying eggs inside some of the flowers and dying. After several weeks' development in their galls, the male wasps emerge before <b>the</b> <b>females.</b> They chew holes in the galls containing females and fertilise them through the hole they have just chewed. Males return later to mated females, and enlarge the mating holes to enable <b>the</b> <b>females</b> to emerge. Some males then chew {{their way through the}} syconium wall, which allows <b>the</b> <b>females</b> to disperse after collecting pollen from the now fully developed male flowers. Females then have a short time (< 48 hours) to find a tree with receptive syconia to successfully reproduce and disperse pollen.|$|E
5|$|In {{laboratory}} tests, Portia species including P. fimbriata {{mate with}} other species, but <b>the</b> <b>females</b> then produce no eggs.|$|E
5|$|Satellite males, about 16% of {{the total}} number, have white or mottled ruffs and do not occupy territories; they enter leks and attempt to mate with <b>the</b> <b>females</b> visiting the territories {{occupied}} by the resident males. Resident males tolerate the satellite birds because, although they are competitors for mating with <b>the</b> <b>females,</b> the presence of both types of male on a territory attracts additional females. Females also prefer larger leks, and leks surrounded by taller plants, which give better nesting habitat.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>female</b> lays {{eggs in a}} disused {{woodpecker}} or barbet hole. Both sexes incubate {{during the}} day, but only <b>the</b> <b>female</b> at night. <b>The</b> male feeds <b>the</b> <b>female,</b> but holds <b>the</b> prey items while <b>the</b> <b>female</b> tears off pieces. Lesser honeyguides and greater honeyguides parasitise up to a quarter of nests.|$|R
25|$|The {{process of}} {{oviposition}} in gulf fritillaries begins with <b>the</b> <b>female</b> butterfly flying low and slightly above the vegetation (most likely the typical host plants like Passiflora incarnata or Passiflora lutea) and lasts until <b>the</b> <b>female</b> pauses above an individual plant. Then, <b>the</b> <b>female</b> makes {{contact with the}} host plant by landing; <b>the</b> <b>female</b> then deposits an egg to complete the process of oviposition. The driving factor behind what causes <b>the</b> <b>female</b> to oviposit {{on or near the}} host plant is most likely due to the certain chemical composition of the specific genus of the host plant. Once <b>the</b> <b>female</b> recognizes <b>the</b> chemical composition (by using <b>the</b> antennae), <b>the</b> <b>female</b> will oviposit.|$|R

5|$|The fairy-bluebirds are bulbul-like {{birds of}} open forest or thorn scrub. The males are dark-blue and <b>the</b> <b>females</b> a duller green.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>females</b> of some moths have a scent-emitting organ {{located at}} the tip of the abdomen.|$|E
5|$|The nests, built {{entirely by}} the female, are mud {{plastered}} to cave entrances or rocky outcrops in forest ravines. The nests are often constructed from the saliva of <b>the</b> <b>females</b> {{mixed in with}} vegetable matter and mud. The nest is shaped like a concave cup. The female typically lays two white eggs. <b>The</b> <b>females</b> incubates these eggs for about 25 to 28 days.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This report {{examines}} {{intention to}} use <b>the</b> <b>female</b> condom among {{men and women in}} Lusaka, Zambia, who were exposed to mass-marketing of <b>the</b> <b>female</b> condom. METHODS: <b>The</b> study used data from a representative sample of consumers at outlets that sell or distribute <b>the</b> <b>female</b> condom and <b>the</b> male condom. RESULTS: In spite of a high level of awareness of <b>the</b> <b>female</b> condom, use of this method in the last year was considerably lower than use of the male condom. Intention to use <b>the</b> <b>female</b> condom in <b>the</b> future was highest among respondents who had used only <b>the</b> <b>female</b> condom in <b>the</b> last year. CONCLUSIONS: <b>The</b> <b>female</b> condom is likely to be most important for persons who are unable or unwilling to use the male condom...|$|R
5|$|Females in estrus are {{followed}} by males, with copulation initiated by <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> <b>The</b> <b>female</b> will hang from a branch and may vocalise. The male will hold <b>the</b> <b>female</b> and <b>the</b> branch and copulate with her. Urine-marking and vocalising are also used by <b>the</b> <b>female</b> to solicit mating. The male may create a mating plug following copulation.|$|R
50|$|During mating, {{the male}} {{typically}} approaches <b>the</b> <b>female,</b> grasping <b>the</b> ventral region of <b>the</b> <b>female's</b> mantle while using the dorsal arm {{to transfer the}} spermatophores to <b>the</b> <b>female's</b> mantle cavity. Mating typically lasts from 68 to 80 minutes. During this time, <b>the</b> <b>female</b> may change in color or pattern, while the male's coloration generally stays constant.|$|R
5|$|There are no {{dominance}} hierarchies among <b>the</b> <b>females,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>females</b> do {{not form}} coalitions. Males {{in the group}} are generally {{related to each other}} and thus tend to form strong affiliations, and only form dominance hierarchies during the breeding season. This is especially the case among males of the same age. Neither males nor females are dominant over each other, an egalitarian social system that is unique to Central American squirrel monkeys. In South American species, either <b>the</b> <b>females</b> (S. boliviensis) or males (S. sciureus) are dominant over the other sex, and both sexes form stable dominance hierarchies. Groups of Central American squirrel monkeys generally do not compete or fight with each other. Male Costa Rican squirrel monkeys are known to have very close bonds with each other.|$|E
5|$|Walruses live {{to about}} 20–30 {{years old in}} the wild. The males reach sexual {{maturity}} as early as seven years, but do not typically mate until fully developed at around 15 years of age. They rut from January through April, decreasing their food intake dramatically. <b>The</b> <b>females</b> begin ovulating as soon as four to six years old. <b>The</b> <b>females</b> are polyestrous, coming into heat in late summer and also around February, yet the males are fertile only around February; the potential fertility of this second period is unknown. Breeding occurs from January to March, peaking in February. Males aggregate in the water around ice-bound groups of estrous females and engage in competitive vocal displays. <b>The</b> <b>females</b> join them and copulate in the water.|$|E
5|$|Amplexus {{lasts for}} 10 to 15 minutes. Once mated, the males will defend <b>the</b> <b>females</b> {{for a short}} period (around 15 minutes). After this period, <b>the</b> <b>females</b> begin to exhibit {{aggressive}} behavior and will drive off the males. They will then bend their fourth and fifth pereonites at a 90-degree angle. Once their genital openings (located on the fifth pereonite) are aligned {{with the opening of the}} brood pouches, they quickly deposit fertilized eggs into them. Females carrying fertilized eggs remain highly aggressive towards males throughout the brooding period, indicating maternal behavior intended to protect the developing embryo from male aggression.|$|E
50|$|In the Yemeni species Tidarren argo, the {{remaining}} palp is then torn off by <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> Spider males use their palp to transfer semen into <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> <b>The</b> separated palp remains attached to <b>the</b> <b>female's</b> epigynum {{for about four}} hours and apparently continues to function independently. In <b>the</b> meantime <b>the</b> <b>female</b> feeds on <b>the</b> palpless male.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, vagina worship {{describes}} a sexual fascination with <b>the</b> <b>female</b> {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>female</b> sex organ, {{along with all the}} practices related to the deification of <b>the</b> <b>female</b> and her respective and 'representative' sexual organ.|$|R
50|$|When {{a female}} {{is ready to}} spawn, she will {{typically}} nip and tilt every 3 to 5 seconds. At this point, the male will immediately contact and attempt to sidle <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> After <b>the</b> third to fifth nip, <b>the</b> <b>female</b> will halt, allowing the male to fully sidle. Sidling by the male causes <b>the</b> <b>female</b> to form an S-shape, which causes the male to also form an S-shape and concurrently wrap his anal fin around <b>the</b> <b>female’s</b> vent. After <b>the</b> <b>female</b> is wrapped, both fish jerk; jerking typically causes <b>the</b> <b>female</b> to release one egg, while ostensibly causing the male to fertilize said egg. Though the pair usually separates to leave one fertilized egg in <b>the</b> substrate, <b>the</b> <b>female</b> will very occasionally immediately form an S-shape and both fish will again perform the jerking sequence.|$|R
5|$|Chani Gurewitz oversaw costume {{design for}} the film, {{and much of the}} low budget was spent on the {{clothing}} worn by the actors, which was designed to be soft and colorful. Hasidic style of dress was used, including headgear and heavy attire worn by the males and modest dresses and head coverings worn by <b>the</b> <b>females.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cicadas {{sometimes}} {{cause damage}} to amenity shrubs and trees, {{mainly in the}} form of scarring left on tree branches where <b>the</b> <b>females</b> laid their eggs. Branches of young trees may die as a result.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{explained}} such male-female {{differences in}} {{his theory of}} sexual selection in his book The Descent of Man. Once <b>the</b> <b>females</b> begin to select males according to any particular characteristic, such as a long tail or a coloured crest, that characteristic is emphasized {{more and more in}} the males. Eventually all the males will have the characteristics that <b>the</b> <b>females</b> are sexually selecting for, as only those males can reproduce. This mechanism is powerful enough to create features that are strongly disadvantageous to the males in other ways. For example, some male birds of paradise have wing or tail streamers that are so long that they impede flight, while their brilliant colours may make the males more vulnerable to predators. In the extreme, sexual selection may drive species to extinction, as has been argued for the enormous horns of the male Irish elk, which may have made it difficult for mature males to move and feed.|$|E
5000|$|Halting and sidling—after nipping, <b>the</b> <b>female</b> will halt, whereupon {{the male}} will swim forward and {{laterally}} against <b>the</b> <b>female,</b> thrusting <b>the</b> {{area at the}} base of his anal fin against the posterior line of <b>the</b> <b>female’s</b> abdomen.|$|R

50|$|A pair of Neuse River waterdogs crawl slowly, {{with the}} male {{trailing}} <b>the</b> <b>female</b> by 2-4 cm. The male positions his snout behind the rear legs of <b>the</b> <b>female</b> when she stops. <b>The</b> <b>female</b> has her gills flared, while the male has his {{close to the}} neck. The male then moves across her body {{at the base of}} her tail. Once parallel, the male begins to stroke <b>the</b> <b>female</b> with his chin. This stroking begins {{at the top of the}} head, moves roughly halfway down <b>the</b> <b>female</b> and back to <b>the</b> head. <b>The</b> <b>female</b> then raises her head each time the male's chin contacts her neck or head. This sequence repeats many times over a period of roughly 18 minutes. The male then circles <b>the</b> <b>female</b> in a clockwise direction while maintaining contact with her. After several slow circles are made, the males moves parallel to <b>the</b> <b>female</b> and places his limbs over her back. The pair remains in this position for 30 minutes and retreats.|$|R
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{higher levels of}} {{androgen}} exposure, the female hyenas are significantly more muscular and aggressive than their male counterparts; social-wise, they are of higher rank than the males, being dominant or dominant and alpha, and <b>the</b> <b>females</b> who {{have been exposed to}} higher levels of androgen than average become higher-ranking than their female peers. Subordinate females lick the clitorises of higher-ranked females as a sign of submission and obedience, but females also lick each other's clitorises as a greeting or to strengthen social bonds; in contrast, while all males lick the clitorises of dominant females, <b>the</b> <b>females</b> will not lick the penises of males because males are considered to be of lowest rank.|$|E
5|$|Females lay up to 3,000 eggs {{in one or}} more silk egg sacs, which {{maintain}} a fairly constant humidity level. In some species, <b>the</b> <b>females</b> die afterwards, but females of other species protect the sacs by attaching them to their webs, hiding them in nests, carrying them in the chelicerae or attaching them to the spinnerets and dragging them along.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} of the Guanche mummies of Tenerife found that they were quite tall. On average, the males stood 1.70 m and <b>the</b> <b>females</b> were 1.57 m in height. They were also generally of robust constitution.|$|E
60|$|When <b>the</b> <b>female</b> mind {{gets into}} this state, no wise man answers <b>the</b> <b>female</b> questions.|$|R
50|$|Mating {{takes place}} mainly in June. The male climbs {{onto the back}} of <b>the</b> <b>female</b> to copulate. Finally, the male leaves <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> <b>The</b> <b>female</b> during <b>the</b> entire mating is {{completely}} passive and does not show any aggressive behaviour.|$|R
5|$|After mating, <b>the</b> <b>female</b> washes her vulva thoroughly. If a male {{attempts}} {{to mate with}} her at this point, <b>the</b> <b>female</b> will attack him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once <b>the</b> <b>female</b> is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.|$|R
