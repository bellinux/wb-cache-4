25|$|The lone {{ammonium}} molecule problem {{provides a}} problem for Jackson's solution to epiphenomenal ectoplasm. It was proposed by Jaegwon Kim in 1993 when he stated that according to Jackson's idea of supervenience, a possible world W was identical to <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> <b>world,</b> except it possessed an extra ammonium molecule on one of Saturn's rings. This may not seem to provide much of a problem, but because Jackson's solution refers only to minimal physical duplicates, this allows for the mental properties of W to be vastly different from in <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> <b>world.</b> If such a difference would cause mental differences on Earth, {{it would not be}} consistent with our understanding of physicalism.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} is essentially whether correlations between base and supervenient properties hold within actual worlds only, or across possible worlds. For example, if psychological properties strongly locally supervene on physical properties, then any two people physically the same, in any two worlds, {{will also be}} psychologically the same. On the other hand, if psychological properties only weakly locally supervene on physical properties, then those correlations between base and supervenient properties that hold in virtue of the supervenience relation are maintained within each world, but can be different in different worlds. For example, my physical duplicates in <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> <b>world</b> {{will have the same}} thoughts as I have; but my physical duplicates in other possible worlds may have different thoughts than I have in <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

Therefore, it is certainly possible that a person completes the world by only making morally good choices; that is, there exist possible worlds where a person freely chooses to do no moral evil. However, it may be the case that for each such world, there is some morally significant choice that this person would do differently if these circumstances were to occur in <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> <b>world.</b> In other words, each such possible world contains a world segment, meaning everything about that world up {{to the point where the}} person must make that critical choice, such that if that segment was part of <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> <b>world,</b> the person would instead go wrong in completing that world.

[...] Science requires that we be rational, that we try to actively understand the world, and to take steps to verify our understanding." [...] In this sense, it is the ultimately responsible perspective.

2500|$|The {{problem of}} {{necessary}} beings was proposed by Jackson in 1998, {{in which he}} stated that a necessary being exists in all possible worlds as a non-physical entity, and therefore proves physicalism false. However, physicalism allows {{for the existence of}} necessary beings, because any minimal physical duplicate would have the same mental properties as <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> <b>world.</b> This however is paradoxical, {{based on the fact that}} physicalism both permits and prevents the existence of such beings.

5000|$|Yovel’s major work on Kant was {{to become}} his Kant and the Philosophy of History (Princeton 1980, 1986; French 1989). Kant’s {{historical}} thought had {{for a long time}} been ignored, or dismissed as marginal and inconsistent. Yovel's work was instrumental in reversing this outlook. The book goes beyond Kant's customary moral teaching, which revolves on the formal and personal characteristics of morality, to uncover a second, material tier in Kant's practical philosophy, in which the moral will becomes a world-shaping will: the will is not satisfied with its personal morality alone, but works to reshape the entire social-historical world as [...] "a moral totality". The will does not only strive to make itself good, but to reshape its world in its own image—to see its moral goals embodied in <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> <b>world's</b> ways and institutions. This makes possible a critical philosophy of history, and of particular areas within it—politics, law, social ethics, moral education, and a religion of reason.|$|R
2500|$|Epiphenomenal ectoplasm was {{proposed}} by Horgan and Lewis in 1983, {{in which they}} stated, a possible world (a world that could possibly exist) W is identical to our world {{in the distribution of}} all mental and physical characteristics (i.e. they are identical), except world W contains an experience called epiphenomenal ectoplasm that does not causally interact with that world. If supervenience physicalism is true, then such a world could not exist because a physical duplicate of <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> <b>world</b> (the world that is known to exist) could not possess an epiphenomenal ectoplasm. This was rectified by Frank Jackson, by adjusting the application of supervenience within physicalism to state [...] "Physicalism is true at a possible world W if and only if any world which is a minimal physical duplicate (i.e. identical) of W is a duplicate of W simpliciter." ...|$|E
2500|$|Act utilitarianism {{not only}} {{requires}} everyone {{to do what}} they can to maximize utility, but to do so without any favouritism.

[...] Critics say that this combination of requirements leads to utilitarianism making unreasonable demands. The well-being of strangers counts just as much as that of friends, family or self. [...] "What makes this requirement so demanding is the gargantuan number of strangers in great need of help and the indefinitely many opportunities to make sacrifices to help them." [...] As Shelly Kagan says, [...] "Given the parameters of <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> <b>world,</b> {{there is no question that}} …(maximally)… promoting the good would require a life of hardship, self-denial, and austerity…a life spent promoting the good would be a severe one indeed." ...|$|E

[...] Many theological themes underlie the narrative, including {{the battle of}} good versus evil, the triumph of humility over pride, and the activity of grace, as seen with Frodo's pity toward Gollum. In addition the epic includes the themes of death and immortality, mercy and pity, resurrection, salvation, repentance, self-sacrifice, free will, justice, fellowship, authority and healing. Tolkien mentions the Lord's Prayer, especially the line [...] "And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil" [...] in connection with Frodo's struggles against {{the power of the}} One Ring. Tolkien has also said [...] "Of course God is in The Lord of the Rings. The period was pre-Christian, but it was a monotheistic world" [...] and when questioned who was the One God of Middle-earth, Tolkien replied [...] "The one, of course!

2500|$|Fisher {{believed}} that investors and savers – {{people in general}} – were afflicted in varying degrees by [...] "money illusion"; they could not see past {{the money to the}} goods the money could buy. In an ideal world, changes in the price level would have no effect on production or employment. In <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> <b>world</b> with money illusion, inflation (and deflation) did serious harm. [...] For more than forty years, Fisher elaborated his vision of the damaging “dance of the dollar” and devised various schemes to “stabilize” money, i.e. to stabilize the price level. He {{was one of the first}} to subject macroeconomic data, including the money stock, interest rates, and the price level, to statistical analyses and tests. In the 1920s, he introduced the technique later called distributed lags. In 1973, the Journal of Political Economy posthumously reprinted his 1926 paper on the statistical relation between unemployment and inflation, retitling it as [...] "I discovered the Phillips curve". Index numbers played an important role in his monetary theory, and his book The Making of Index Numbers has remained influential down to the present day.|$|E
2500|$|The metaphysical {{distinction}} between necessary and contingent truths {{has also been}} related to a priori and a posteriori knowledge. A proposition that is necessarily true is one whose negation is self-contradictory (thus, {{it is said to}} be true in every possible world). Consider the proposition that all bachelors are unmarried. Its negation, the proposition that some bachelors are married, is incoherent, because the concept of being unmarried (or {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "unmarried") is part of the concept of being a bachelor (or part of the definition of the word [...] "bachelor"). To the extent that contradictions are impossible, self-contradictory propositions are necessarily false, because it is impossible for them to be true. Thus, the negation of a self-contradictory proposition is supposed to be necessarily true. By contrast, a proposition that is contingently true is one whose negation is not self-contradictory (thus, it is said that it is not true in every possible world). As Jason Baehr states, it seems plausible that all necessary propositions are known a priori, because [...] "ense experience can tell us only about <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> <b>world</b> and hence about what is the case; it can say nothing about what must or must not be the case." ...|$|E
