5|$|Anti-Communist {{sentiment}} {{gripped the}} United States during the Cold War beginning in 1946.

30|$|The {{self-employed}} {{were more}} likely to report that <b>their</b> <b>job</b> was the ideal one for them (compared with full-time workers) while those who were involuntarily employed full-time were less likely to report so (Model (3)). The voluntary part-time workers were as likely as their full-time counterparts to think <b>their</b> <b>job</b> is ideal.

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{large-scale}} project, this study investigated the differences between satisfied and dissatisfied Iranian junior secondary school English teachers in terms of <b>their</b> <b>job</b> performance. To this end, 64 Iranian English teachers and 1774 of their students completed a validated questionnaire specifically developed to investigate EFL teachers’ job performance. The results indicated that satisfied teachers significantly differed from their dissatisfied counterparts in terms of <b>their</b> <b>job</b> performance suggesting that the observed differences in <b>their</b> <b>job</b> performance might have mainly been caused by {{the degree to which}} they were satisfied with their profession. The results also showed a significant difference between students’ evaluation of <b>their</b> teachers’ <b>job</b> performance and the teachers’ self-evaluation of <b>their</b> <b>job</b> performance. Furthermore, through a semi-structured interview, the most crucial factors contributing to poor job performance of dissatisfied Iranian secondary school EFL teachers were identified to be an insufficient subject and pedagogic knowledge, unequal attention to individual students, lack of professional commitment, interpersonal relationship problems, and demotivation...|$|R

40|$|Because staff {{attitudes and}} affects are impediments or {{strengths}} in appropriately assessing and managing traumatized or violent patients, the authors discuss {{the need to}} explore staff's experience with trauma and violence. A survey of social service field and administrative office-based staff revealed that numerous staff had experienced traumatic events. Compared with staff based in a downtown administrative office, significantly more field-based staff were dissatisfied with <b>their</b> <b>job's</b> neighborhood and perceived <b>their</b> <b>job's</b> neighborhood as a dangerous place to work. Further, significantly more field staff perceived that <b>their</b> <b>job's</b> neighbors would be "unlikely" to intervene in observed antisocial behaviors. In our sample of primarily female, African-American, social service staff, the ratio of victimization was higher than rates in other studies. Screening social service staff for experiences of trauma and victimization and asking about their perceptions about <b>their</b> <b>job's</b> neighborhood will help leadership shape efforts to address these dynamics. By addressing staff's perceptions of <b>their</b> <b>job's</b> neighborhood, leadership can influence staff's willingness to participate in proactive community organizing and prevention activities designed to reduce violence and increase safety. Several recommendations to reduce violence in the workplace are presented...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine how}} couples' labour supply {{behaviour}} in the UK responds {{to a job}} loss by one partner, using the Labour Force Survey to compare the period of growth of 1995 - 2007 to the Great Recession and its aftermath of 2008 - 11. In single earner couples during the recession, {{both men and women}} substantially increased <b>their</b> <b>job</b> search activity following a partner's job loss, while the increase in search during the boom was smaller (and non-existent for men). However, the increase in job search during recession did not appear to translate into more success in finding work for either men or women. Among dual earner couples, we find little evidence that individuals searched for alternative jobs or tried to increase their hours if their partner lost <b>their</b> <b>job,</b> except that women working part-time were more likely to start looking for another job. Both men and women were more likely to quit <b>their</b> <b>job</b> voluntarily if <b>their</b> partner lost <b>their</b> <b>job,</b> but the recession seems to have made people more cautious about voluntarily quitting <b>their</b> <b>job.</b> We find little evidence that people react in advance of job losses, suggesting that unemployment typically comes as a surprise...|$|R
