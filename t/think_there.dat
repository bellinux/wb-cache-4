He said“I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> were a few things that went wrong; I underestimated the ISL. I {{thought it was going to}} be easier than it was, and then I picked up a hamstring injury in pre-season which set me back.|$|E
5|$|The {{thought of}} {{acting in a}} film had never even entered their minds.

Paz, however, was {{definitely}} conscious of the fact that she was interpreting a role.|$|E
5|$|The divine power seems {{originally}} to {{have designed}} Demosthenes and Cicero upon the same plan, giving them many similarities {{in their natural}} characters, as their passion for distinction and their love of liberty in civil life, and their want of courage in dangers and war, {{and at the same}} time also to have added many accidental resemblances. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> can hardly be found two other orators, who, from small and obscure beginnings, became so great and mighty; who both contested with kings and tyrants; both lost their daughters, were driven out of their country, and returned with honor; who, flying from thence again, were both seized upon by their enemies, and at last ended their lives with the liberty of their countrymen.|$|E

5000|$|I {{think that}} he {{committed}} suicide. I don't <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> a smoking gun. And I <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> only one way you can explain {{a lot of things}} around his death. Not that he was murdered, but that there was just a lack of caring for him. I just think that Courtney had moved on, and he was expendable.|$|R
25|$|I {{sometimes}} <b>think</b> <b>there</b> are two Wagners in our culture, almost unrecognizably {{different from}} one another: the Wagner possessed by those who know his work, and the Wagner imagined by {{those who know him}} only by name and reputation.|$|E

25|$|The {{band was}} a lot of fun. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> was great rapport between the people in it. And none of us wanted to leave. We were always getting sort of offers from other bands for much more money than we were making with Woody, and it was always like if you left, you were a rat. You were really letting down the team.|$|E

25|$|Between {{historians and}} novelists, Joan has {{appeared}} in various texts as either an independent and spirited woman or a spoiled brat. In Lives of the Princesses of England by Mary Anne Everett Green, Joan is portrayed as a “giddy princess” and neglectful mother. Many have agreed to this characterization; however, some authors <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is little {{evidence to support the}} assumption that Joan of Acre was a neglectful or uncaring mother.|$|E
25|$|I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is any {{evidence}} {{that there have been}} any renditions carried out in the country of Syria. There is no evidence of that.

It is something very important, it is done very carefully and she has said we do not authorise, condone torture in any way, shape or form.|$|E

Brody starts to wonder if anyone will cry for him if he dies. The regiment finds a dead resistance fighter and returns his body to the village to be buried. The story ends with Brody crying for the dead resistance fighter.|$|E
25|$|At first I {{was only}} {{thinking}} about the response from my clique of art school and skateboard friends. The fact that a larger segment of the public would not only notice, but investigate, the unexplained appearance of the stickers was something I had not contemplated. When I started to see reactions and consider the sociological forces at work surrounding {{the use of public}} space and the insertion of a very eye-catching but ambiguous image, I began to <b>think</b> <b>there</b> was the potential to create a phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is {{a growing}} distaste for the family duties among women … that should be condemned. The efforts of women to equal man in studies, work, etc., while still {{claiming}} their sex privileges, with the dissolution of club and society life, are leading to a 'race suicide.' This ought not to be. Woman is anatomically, physiologically, and emotionally evolved for one sole and single purpose, any departure therefrom being done at the violation of her best ideals and a misdirection of energy.|$|E

25|$|Radcliffe {{had already}} {{established}} himself as an actor in the 1999 BBC television production of David Copperfield in which he played the title role's childhood years. Heyman persuaded Radcliffe's parents {{to allow him to}} audition for the part of Harry Potter, which involved Radcliffe being filmed. (This screen test footage was released via the first set of Ultimate Editions in 2009.) Rowling was enthusiastic after viewing Radcliffe's filmed test, saying she didn't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> was a better choice for the part of Harry Potter.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the Roman conquest in AD43, there was an oppidum in the {{southern}} part of their territory, probably in the Selsey region. A number of archaeologists now <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is a strong possibility that the Roman invasion of Britain in AD43 started around Fishbourne and Chichester Harbour rather than the traditional landing place of Richborough in Kent. According to this theory, the Romans were called to restore the refugee Verica, king of the Atrebates, who had been driven out by the Catuvellauni, a tribe based around modern Hertfordshire.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary with Hume, but {{critical}} of Hume's scepticism, a so-called Scottish school of Common Sense formed, whose basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, Thomas Reid:If {{there are certain}} principles, as I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity {{to take for granted}} in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them — these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd.|$|E

25|$|Berkeley's biographer, J. D. Davies, wrote after {{examining}} his letters that Berkeley {{appears as a}} 'lively, friendly young man, fully aware of his dependence on the patronage of others, supportive of and loving towards his family, and genuinely enthusiastic to make a success of his chosen career', quoting a letter from William to Charles Berkeley in June 1663: I must assure you I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is no so beggarly a trade as this if people serve truly and honestly, as I am resolved I will do, although I am never worth six pence. All my hope is on my dearest brother's kindness.|$|E
25|$|A 1959-1970 bear study {{suggested}} {{a grizzly bear}} population size of about 176, later revised to about 229. Later estimates have ranged as low as 136 and as high as 540; the most recent is a minimum estimate of 236, but biologists <b>think</b> <b>there</b> may {{be as many as}} 1,000 bears in the ecosystem. Although the Greater Yellowstone population is relatively close to recovery goals, the plan's definition of recovery is controversial. Thus, even though the population may be stable or possibly increasing in the short term, in the longer term, continued habitat loss, climate change, and increasing human activities may well reverse the trend.|$|E
25|$|If {{you wish}} you may tell the police {{to be careful not}} to rile me. Of course, I am a {{reasonable}} spirit. I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.|$|E
