5|$|The third spirit, <b>the</b> <b>Ghost</b> of Christmas Yet to Come, shows Scrooge a Christmas Day in the future. <b>The</b> <b>ghost</b> {{shows him}} scenes {{involving}} {{the death of}} a disliked man. The man's funeral will only be attended by local businessmen if lunch is provided. His charwoman, his laundress, and the local undertaker steal some of his possessions and sell them to a fence. When Scrooge asks <b>the</b> <b>ghost</b> to show anyone who feels any emotion over the man's death, <b>the</b> <b>ghost</b> can only show him the pleasure of a poor couple in debt to the man, rejoicing that his death gives them more time to put their finances in order. After Scrooge asks to see some tenderness connected with any death, <b>the</b> <b>ghost</b> shows him Bob Cratchit and his family mourning the passing of Tiny Tim. <b>The</b> <b>ghost</b> then shows Scrooge the man's neglected grave, whose tombstone bears Scrooge's name. Sobbing, Scrooge pledges to <b>the</b> <b>ghost</b> that he will change his ways to avoid this outcome.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ghosts</b> must {{be avoided}} {{when they are}} their normal colors.

50|$|One aim of {{the game}} besides eating all the Pac-Dots is {{avoiding}} being defeated by any of <b>the</b> four <b>ghosts.</b> Running into a ghost will kill Pac-Man on contact, unless Pac-Man consumes a Power Pellet. These pellets, which can {{be more or less}} strategically placed when creating a maze (a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 10 per maze), will make ghosts edible to Pac-Man and turns the table completely, since now <b>the</b> <b>ghosts</b> are running away from Pac-Man instead of him being chased by <b>the</b> <b>ghosts.</b> In <b>the</b> original game <b>the</b> <b>ghosts</b> are hunted in a very defined pattern of Scatter, Chase and Repeat. Unlike the original, <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>ghosts</b> remain vulnerable does not diminish as the game progresses to the point where <b>the</b> <b>ghosts</b> will only merely reverse direction. If the player leaves a board without completing it, <b>the</b> <b>ghosts</b> will remain immobile in that maze until Pac-Man returns, in which they will begin chasing him again.|$|R

5000|$|Hungry ghosts are {{different}} from <b>the</b> <b>ghosts</b> of Chinese traditions, which all people are believed to become after death. According to the Buddha Dharma, there are three main groups of hungry ghosts: those with no wealth, those with a little and those with a lot. [...] Those with no wealth are broken into three groups: the torch or flaming mouths, in which food and drink become flames; the needle mouths, whose throats are so tiny that food cannot pass through; and the vile mouths, whose mouths are so decomposed and smelly that they cannot ingest anything. <b>The</b> <b>ghosts</b> with a little wealth are able to eat small amounts. <b>The</b> <b>ghosts</b> with great wealth also have three subgroups: <b>the</b> <b>ghosts</b> of sacrifices, who live off sacrifices offered by humans and are similar to spirits described in China; <b>the</b> <b>ghosts</b> of losses, who live off lost objects from the human world; and <b>the</b> <b>ghosts</b> of great powers, like yakshas and rakshasas, who are the powerful rulers of <b>ghosts.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ghosts</b> of sacrifices and losses sometimes suffer from hunger and thirst, whereas <b>the</b> <b>ghosts</b> of great powers have pleasures close to those of divine beings. Among hungry ghosts, however, most {{have little or no}} wealth and are extremely hungry.|$|R
