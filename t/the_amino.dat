5|$|Most {{microorganisms}} {{and plants}} can biosynthesize all 20 standard amino acids, while animals (including humans) must obtain some of <b>the</b> <b>amino</b> acids from the diet. <b>The</b> <b>amino</b> acids that an organism cannot synthesize {{on its own}} {{are referred to as}} essential amino acids. Key enzymes that synthesize certain amino acids are not present in animals — such as aspartokinase, which catalyses {{the first step in the}} synthesis of lysine, methionine, and threonine from aspartate. If amino acids are present in the environment, microorganisms can conserve energy by taking up <b>the</b> <b>amino</b> acids from their surroundings and downregulating their biosynthetic pathways.|$|E

5|$|Amino acids {{are either}} used to {{synthesize}} proteins and other biomolecules, or oxidized to urea {{and carbon dioxide}} {{as a source of}} energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of <b>the</b> <b>amino</b> group by a transaminase. <b>The</b> <b>amino</b> group is fed into the urea cycle, leaving a deaminated carbon skeleton {{in the form of a}} keto acid. Several of these keto acids are intermediates in the citric acid cycle, for example the deamination of glutamate forms α-ketoglutarate. The glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis (discussed below).|$|E

30|$|Test 2 {{asked whether}} <b>the</b> 10 <b>amino</b> acids that {{are thought to}} have been later {{additions}} to the genetic code represent a quantifiable expansion of amino acid chemistry space. Here we see a weak signal that <b>the</b> late <b>amino</b> acids lie further in chemistry space from the earlies than expected by chance. It appears, however, that most of this effect is coming from the dimension of size. In other words, the later additions to <b>the</b> standard <b>amino</b> acid alphabet differ from <b>the</b> early <b>amino</b> acids primarily in that they were larger. Considering that <b>the</b> early <b>amino</b> acids include <b>the</b> smallest L-alpha <b>amino</b> acids that are chemically possible, this is perhaps not surprising. Nevertheless, so long as we accept that size is an important component of an adaptive chemistry space, then these results support an adaptive explanation: <b>the</b> late <b>amino</b> acids show a literal expansion of two and three-dimensional chemistry space. This assumption is bolstered by the results of the same test performed with Glycine and Alanine removed, where we still find that, in almost 90 % of trials, <b>the</b> true late <b>amino</b> acids show a greater expansion in chemistry space than would be expected by chance. Our findings again are in general agreement with previous inference drawn from a different approach, where <b>the</b> late <b>amino</b> acids are believed to have been advantageous precisely because of their “unique specialized” structure [21].|$|R
50|$|Schultz has pioneered {{a method}} for adding new {{building}} blocks, beyond <b>the</b> common twenty <b>amino</b> acids, to <b>the</b> genetic codes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.

5|$|As {{both the}} amine and {{carboxylic}} acid groups of amino acids can {{react to form}} amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins. This condensation reaction yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, <b>the</b> <b>amino</b> acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of <b>the</b> <b>amino</b> group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond.

5|$|In plants, {{nitrogen}} {{is first}} assimilated into organic compounds {{in the form}} of glutamate, formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion. In order to form other amino acids, the plant uses transaminases to move <b>the</b> <b>amino</b> group to another alpha-keto carboxylic acid. For example, aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate. Other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis, too.|$|E
5|$|In proteins, Zinc ions {{are often}} coordinated to <b>the</b> <b>amino</b> acid side chains of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, {{cysteine}} and histidine.

5|$|Irreversible inhibitors usually covalently modify an enzyme, and {{inhibition}} {{can therefore}} not be reversed. Irreversible inhibitors often contain reactive functional {{groups such as}} nitrogen mustards, aldehydes, haloalkanes, alkenes, Michael acceptors, phenyl sulfonates, or fluorophosphonates. These electrophilic groups react with amino acid side chains to form covalent adducts.

5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{undergo a}} range of posttranslational modifications, when additional chemical groups are attached to <b>the</b> <b>amino</b> acids in proteins. Some modifications can produce hydrophobic lipoproteins, or hydrophilic glycoproteins. These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane.

5|$|Microbes simply secrete {{digestive}} enzymes into their surroundings, while animals only secrete these enzymes from specialized cells in their guts, including {{the stomach and}} pancreas, and salivary glands. <b>The</b> <b>amino</b> acids or sugars released by these extracellular enzymes are then pumped into cells by active transport proteins.|$|E
50|$|Stickland {{fermentation}} or The Stickland Reaction is {{the name}} for a chemical reaction that involves the coupled oxidation and reduction of amino acids to organic acids. <b>The</b> electron donor <b>amino</b> acid is oxidised to a volatile carboxylic acid one carbon atom shorter than <b>the</b> original <b>amino</b> acid.
