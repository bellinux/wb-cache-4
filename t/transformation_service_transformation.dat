Essentially, he initiated and instigated the overhaul and remodeling of the company dubbed the [...] "new AT&T" [...] by SBC. The New York Times called him [...] "the technological strategist behind AT&T's ambitious turnaround plan to become a data transmission company selling an array of software products like network security systems," [...] (01/22/2005). He predicted and advocated an architecture that would allow all services to run on IP and work together with connectivity to any device and advised top leaders accordingly on the formulation and implementation of his strategic technologic vision. He left AT&T soon after its merger with SBC in January 2006. Upon his departure, BusinessWeek called him [...] "a critical player in maintaining AT&T's status as a technology leader" [...] (12/2005) and noted that he is [...] "a bold, but pragmatic, visionary." ...|$|E

40|$|The role {{of digital}} {{technologies}} in <b>service</b> business <b>transformation</b> is under-investigated. This paper contributes to filling this gap by addressing how the Internet of things (IoT), cloud computing (CC) and predictive analytics (PA) facilitate <b>service</b> <b>transformation</b> in industrial companies. Through the Data–Information–Knowledge–Wisdom (DIKW) model, we discuss how the abovementioned technologies transform low-level entities such as data into information and knowledge {{to support the}} <b>service</b> <b>transformation</b> of manufacturers. We propose a set of digital capabilities, based on the extant literature and the findings from four case studies. Then, we discuss how these capabilities support the <b>service</b> <b>transformation</b> trajectories of manufacturers. We find that IoT is foundational to any <b>service</b> <b>transformation,</b> although it is mostly needed to become an availability provider. PA is essential for moving to the performance provider profile. Besides providing scalability in all profiles, CC is specifically used to implement an industrialiser strategy, therefore leading to standardised, repeatable and productised offering...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To be {{successful}} in the <b>service</b> <b>transformation,</b> manufacturers should shift their value proposition from a product-centric one to a product-service system (PSS), and redesign their business model (BM). However, no specific model in the literature has been designed to analyse the maturity of the company’s resources and capabilities concerning this transformation. To provide a first step into closing this gap, this paper develops a maturity model that can be used by companies to assess their current BM and highlight the main gaps in the <b>service</b> <b>transformation</b> journey. Design/Methodology/Approach: This paper provides a new structured tool to evaluate the maturity level of company’s resources, capabilities and organizational and managerial aspects needed to successfully develop and deliver a PSS Findings: This paper suggests that maturity models are useful tools to assess the company’s BM and highlight the main gaps in the shift towards PSSs, supporting companies in identifying and bridging the gaps to successfully undertake the servitization journey. Originality/Value: This work contributes to research and practice in the servitization field by adopting a rigorous and literature-based approach to identify the key variables to be assessed in order to support a successful <b>service</b> <b>transformation</b> of product-centric companie...|$|R
