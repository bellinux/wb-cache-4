40|$|Graduation date: 1978 During {{the summers}} of 1975 and 1976 a {{sedimentation}} {{study was conducted}} in the Bear Creek watershed, located in the southeastern corner of Crook County, in central Oregon. The Rocky Mountain infiltrometer was used to simulate high intensity rainfall over 468 sedimentation plots. Rainfall and runoff were measured and a sample of the runoff was collected to determine sediment potentials. The Bear Creek watershed was divided into eight ecological land units which were further refined into 14 tentative habitat types and four unclassified communities, based on an association table developed from vegetation and soils field data. One- and two-factor analysis of variance was used to analyze the differences within habitat types, between habitat types within a unit, and when appropriate, between treatments or ecological condition within the habitat type or unit. <b>Tractor</b> <b>logging</b> in the mixed forest unit caused a significant increase in soil loss.

40|$|California Polytechnic State University 2 ̆ 7 s School Ranch and Forest, called Swanton Pacific Ranch, {{is located}} {{just north of}} Santa Cruz, California and {{encompasses}} approximately 3, 800 acres of crop, range, and forested areas. Coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens [D. Don] Endl.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb. ] Franco var. menziesii) and tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus [Hook. 2 ̆ 6 Arn. ] Rehd.) occur on approciximately 1, 900 acres of the Swanton Pacific Ranch and at Valencia. Because of its high stumpage value, coast redwood is the preferred management species. In addition to economic reality, California Forest Practice laws severely limit the extent of stand manipulation that can occur on any one harvest entry in Santa Cruz County. In our opinion, the only suitable silvicultural system given these currently limiting circumstances is uneven-aged forest management. However, implementing uneven-aged forest management in coast redwood stands involves a number of choices on residual stand density, preferred tree species composition, maximum tree size, q-factor, stand structure, inventory design, tolerable residual stand damage, logging systems, logging costs, reforestation strategies, extent and size of group selection cuts, growth rates, monitoring criteria, ecosystem management, and much more. Single tree and group selection cutting methods have been applied in seven stands encompassing approximately 175 acres of the Scott Creek Watershed, habitat for the now threatened Coho salmon.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a computer program}} developed for the Hewlett Packard 9830, which analyzes and computes costs and engineering data for paper plan timber harvest road networks. The program will accept up to 110 road segments. Each segment is analyzed individually based on digitized data from a contour map and user defined road construction parameters. Three types of construction are analyzed for each segment: fullbench and sidecast, fullbench and endhaul and balanced construction. Program results and operation are exemplified {{in an analysis of}} a proposed transportation plan in a cable logging study area in New England. The study area is on the Green Mountain National Forest in Central Vermont. The transportation plan contains 99 miles of proposed new road within the 25, 000 acre study area.

Variations in the subgrade width and surfacing depth seem to affect cost the most. Fuel consumption of alternative logging systems is also compared in this paper. The results indicate that cable logging initially consumes more fuel due to increased road construction.

40|$|A winch and a sulky can {{transform}} a farm tractor into an effective small-scale logging machine, closely resembling a wheeled cable skidder. The additional cost of these implements is very small, but they offer significant benefits when extracting timber under {{the conditions of}} small-scale forestry. The authors developed a productivity model for skidding timber with wheeled farm tractors, equipped with winch and sulky. The origin data pool contained over 300 individual skidding cycles, extracted from 8 separate tests. Statistical {{analysis of the data}} allowed calculating a simple mathematical relationship for estimating skidding productivity as a function of significant work conditions, such as: piece size, winching distance, tractor power, skidding distance and crew size. This model can provide useful directions to prospective users, contributing to operation planning, costing and optimization. It can predict {{a large proportion of the}} variability in the data and was successfully validated using reserved cycle records, extracted from the same data pool and not used for model development. Depending on tractor power and piece size, the average turn volume and productivity can exceed respectively 2 m 3 per cycle and 4 m 3 per Scheduled Machine Hour (SMH).

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{change in}} {{emphasis}} from <b>tractor</b> and highlead <b>logging</b> systems to the advanced logging systems of skyline, balloon, and helicopter has stirred researchers {{to study the}} operations of the advanced systems. The extra work involved in preparing an area for contract timber removal using advanced logging systems, however, has not been studied. The impacts of the extra time and extra manpower required for this process are large and they are important impacts which need to be taken into consideration during crew work planning. This is difficult to do since the factors which affect crew manhours have not been defined. The objectives of this paper are to determine which factors affect the number of manhours spent on the presale fieldwork portion of preparing a U. S. D. A. Forest Service timber sale for contract; to compare presale field work time on conventional and special-design sales; and to develop a methodology for predicting presale fieldwork time. Previous studies suggest some factors which affect forestry work, but the quantitative changes in production caused by each factor have not been measured. Logging operation research and human engineering studies report that the following factors affect production: underbrush, topography, weather, heat, cold, muscle fatigue, motivation, the work-rest period, tobacco, and alcohol. Motivation is often an overriding factor which outweighs all other considerations. Motivation was not measured in this study, but it was expected to have some effect on the results. Topography, underbrush, and weather were expected {{to be the most important}} variables for predicting manhours. Data or presale fieldwork time were collected from 16 districts on eight National Forests in Oregon and Washington, using a form designed to simplify data collection and coding for computer input. The form was a daily work record which could be easily filled out in a few minutes by the field crew. District personnel on each of the 16 districts were personally contacted about cooperating in the study, but they were not pressured to collect data even if they agreed to cooperate. The sample was designed to collect a distribution of data from the coast, eastside, and Cascade areas respectively, but most data collected came from the Cascade area. Activity categories for data collection included layout, traverse, marking,cruising, skyline profile, wildlife related activity, land line retracement, spur road traverse, spur road location, and timber stand examination. The data were separated by activity and by complete units, and were analyzed using a stepwise multiple regression program. Variables found to increase the number of manhours required for presale fieldwork were acres, boundary sinuosity, and silvicultural treatment. The significant variables which reduced manhours were landscape management designation and the distance walked from the vehicle to the unit. These two variables had been expected to increase manhours, but the effect of motivation may have been the cause for the unexpected reverse of sign on the regression coefficients. Special design designation showed no significant effect on manhours except through boundary sinuosity. The regression equations recommended for use in predicting manhours are for the activities of layout using on-the-ground aerial photo-interpretation; traverse using a hand compass, clinometer, and chain; marking of leave trees; cruising by the variable plot method; and for the Cascade area complete units. Nomographs are provided for the solution of these regression equations...|$|R
