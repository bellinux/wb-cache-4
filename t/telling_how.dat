25|$|In 1992, Francis Ford Coppola {{produced}} and directed Bram Stoker's Dracula starring Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Keanu Reeves, and Anthony Hopkins. Coppola's story includes a backstory <b>telling</b> <b>how</b> Dracula (who is the historical Vlad Țepeș in this version) became a vampire, {{as well as}} a subplot not in Stoker's original novel in which Mina Harker was revealed to be the reincarnation of Dracula's greatest love. Dracula is portrayed as a tragic hero instead of being a villain, and although malevolent, his nature is one which is playful and often flirtatious, evidenced by him shaving Jonathan Harker.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} the exodus is the {{founding}} myth of Israel, <b>telling</b> <b>how</b> the Israelites were delivered from slavery by Yahweh and therefore belong to him through the Mosaic covenant. The Book of Exodus is not a historical narrative in any modern sense: modern history writing requires the critical evaluation of sources, and does not accept God {{as a cause of}} events, but in Exodus, everything is presented as the work of God, who appears frequently in person, and the historical setting is only very hazily sketched. The purpose of the book is not to record what really happened, but to reflect the historical experience of the exile community in Babylon and later Jerusalem, facing foreign captivity and the need {{to come to terms with}} their understanding of God.|$|E
25|$|Beyond this, most {{substances}} {{have three}} ordinarily recognized states of matter, solid, liquid, and gas, {{and a fourth}} less obviously recognized one, plasma. Many have further, more finely differentiated, states of matter, such as for example, glass, and liquid crystal. In many cases, at fixed temperature and pressure, a substance can exist in several distinct states of matter {{in what might be}} viewed as the same 'body'. For example, ice may float in a glass of water. Then the ice and the water are said to constitute two phases within the 'body'. Definite rules are known, <b>telling</b> <b>how</b> distinct phases may coexist in a 'body'. Mostly, at a fixed pressure, there is a definite temperature at which heating causes a solid to melt or evaporate, and a definite temperature at which heating causes a liquid to evaporate. In such cases, cooling has the reverse effects.|$|E

50|$|A {{descriptive}} {{theory is}} one that <b>tells</b> <b>how</b> things are, while a normative theory <b>tells</b> <b>how</b> things ought to be. Expressed in practical terms, a normative theory, more properly called a policy, <b>tells</b> agents <b>how</b> they ought to act. A policy can be an absolute imperative, <b>telling</b> agents <b>how</b> they ought to act in any case, {{or it can be}} a contingent directive, <b>telling</b> agents <b>how</b> they ought to act if they want to achieve a particular goal. A policy is frequently stated {{in the form of a}} piece of advice called a heuristic, a maxim, a norm, a rule, a slogan, and so on. Other names for a policy are a recommendation and a regulative principle.|$|R

[...] "There's no <b>telling</b> <b>how</b> much yardage I might have made if I ran as much as some backs do now," [...] he once said. Running back Jim Brown surpassed Motley's rushing records in the early 1960s, but many of Motley's coaches and fellow players {{regarded}} Motley as the better player, in part because of his strength as a blocker. [...] "There is no comparison between Jim Brown and Marion Motley," [...] Graham said at a luncheon in Canton in 1964. [...] "Motley was the greatest all-around fullback." ...|$|E
500|$|Summing up on {{the impact}} Modern Sounds had on country music and listeners, writer Daniel Cooper states, [...] "There is no <b>telling</b> <b>how</b> many people, who perhaps never paid much {{attention}} to country music or even had professed to dislike it, listened anew based on the impact of having heard what Ray Charles was capable of doing with that music." [...] Charles eventually earned a country music repertoire and reputation following the success of the Modern Sounds records, later country hit singles for Warner Bros. Records, and various appearances at country music events, including The Johnny Cash Show in 1970 and the Grand Ole Opry's 58th anniversary in 1983, the program to which he listened as a youth.|$|E
500|$|Conscious of {{the need}} to improve after his {{uncertain}} start to first-class cricket, Hammond scored his maiden first-class century in the first match of the 1923 season, making 110 and 92 opening the batting against Surrey. He did not reach three figures again that season, but his performances and batting technique impressed several critics, such as cricket correspondent Neville Cardus, former England and Middlesex captain Plum Warner, and The Times correspondent; Cardus described him as a future England player. In all first-class matches that season, Hammond scored 1,421 runs at an average of 27.86. With the ball, he took 18 first-class wickets at an average of 41.22, including figures of six for 59 against Hampshire. Reviewing the season, Wisdens correspondent declared that Hammond [...] "has all the world before him and there is no <b>telling</b> <b>how</b> far he may go".|$|E

Lincoln invited {{him and his wife}} to Ford's Theater, but they declined as they had plans to travel to Philadelphia. In a conspiracy that targeted several government leaders, Lincoln was fatally shot by John Wilkes Booth at the theater, and died the next morning. Many, including Grant himself, thought that he had been a target in the plot. Stanton notified him of the President's death and summoned him back to Washington. Attending Lincoln's funeral on April 19, Grant stood alone and wept openly; he later said Lincoln was [...] "the greatest man I have ever known." [...] Regarding the new President, Andrew Johnson, Grant told Julia that he dreaded the change in administrations; he judged Johnson's attitude toward white southerners as one that would [...] "make them unwilling citizens", and initially thought that with President Johnson, [...] "Reconstruction has been set back no <b>telling</b> <b>how</b> far." ...|$|E
500|$|The Notorious B.I.G.'s lyrics on {{the album}} were {{generally}} praised by critics. Many critics applauded his story-telling ability such as AllMusic writer Steve Huey, who stated [...] "His raps are easy to understand, but his skills are hardly lacking — he has a loose, easy flow and a talent for piling multiple rhymes {{on top of one}} another in quick succession". He also went on to mention that his lyrics are [...] "firmly rooted in reality, but play like [...] scene from a movie". Touré, writing for The New York Times, referred to The Notorious B.I.G., proclaiming that he stood out from other rappers because [...] "his lyrics mix autobiographical details about crime and violence with emotional honesty, <b>telling</b> <b>how</b> he felt while making a living as a drug dealer". The album is also noted for its dark tone and sinister sense of depression. In the original Rolling Stone review, Cheo H Coker declared that he [...] "maintains a consistent level of tension by juxtaposing emotional highs and lows". [...] "Things Done Changed" [...] was also one of the few hip hop songs in The Norton Anthology of African American Literature.|$|E
500|$|... "Hung Up" [...] {{was one of}} {{the first}} songs written for the album, along with [...] "Sorry" [...] and [...] "Future Lovers". It was {{inspired}} by the 1970s disco era, including ABBA, Giorgio Moroder and the film Saturday Night Fever (1977). Madonna imagined it to be a cross between the music played at Danceteria, the New York City night club she frequented in her early days, and the music of ABBA. Their 1979 hit [...] "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)" [...] formed the basis of the song. Songwriters Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus generally do not allow anyone to sample any of their tracks, an exception being Fugees, who sampled their song [...] "The Name of the Game" [...] for their single [...] "Rumble in the Jungle". In order to gain the rights to sample [...] "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!", Madonna had to send her emissary to Stockholm with a letter which begged them to allow her to sample the song and also <b>telling</b> <b>how</b> much she loved their music. To the BBC she explained: [...] "hey never let anyone sample their music. Thank God they didn't say no. [...] They had to think about it, Benny and Björn. They didn't say yes straight away." [...] The pair agreed to let Madonna use the sample only after making a copyright agreement that entitled them to a significant share of the royalties from subsequent sales and airplay. Andersson, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph in October 2005, declared [...] "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!" [...] to be the essence of [...] "Hung Up" [...] while joking that it was his favourite Madonna song thus far. He further said: ...|$|E
