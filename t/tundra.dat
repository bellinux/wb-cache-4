5|$|The {{peninsula}} {{is covered}} by taiga {{in the south and}} <b>tundra</b> in the north. In the <b>tundra,</b> cold and windy conditions and permafrost limit the growth of the trees, resulting in a landscape dominated by grasses, wildflowers, and shrubs such as dwarf birch and cloudberry. In northern coastal areas, stony and shrub lichens are common. The taiga in the southern areas is composed mostly of pine trees and firs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tundra</b> is a sub-Arctic zone with long, cold winters and short, warm summers. Precipitation is low. Soil a meter {{below ground}} and deeper is {{permanently}} frozen (permafrost), {{which does not}} allow water to drain easily through the soil, so it collects in shallow pools. Trees and shrubs are stunted since their roots cannot grow into the permafrost. Low shrubs, lichens, mosses, and small herbaceous plants are found instead. The most common mammals on the <b>tundra</b> are the barren-ground caribou, Arctic wolf, Arctic fox, Arctic hare, lemmings, and voles. Occasional sightings of muskoxen have been made near Cape Chidley, Labrador's most northerly point. The polar bear is the dominant carnivore of the <b>tundra,</b> but is an occasional visitor to coastal Newfoundland, especially in the spring. Many birds migrate to Labrador in spring to lay their eggs and raise their young before returning south for the winter, including the common eider, harlequin duck, Common redpoll and American pipit. The Labrador <b>tundra</b> is also permanent home to ptarmigan.|$|E
5|$|Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River {{attract a}} wide variety of waterfowl. Lake Phelps is just one of several large, shallow {{freshwater}} lakes on the Pamlico-Albemarle Peninsula. These lakes are all winter grounds for ducks, geese and swans. The waterfowl at Lake Phelps use the area primarily for roosting purpose before flying off to nearby feeding sites. <b>Tundra</b> swans and Canada geese feed in nearby farm fields and the ducks feed in the wetlands. The waterfowl usually arrive in the area in October and overwinter until February or March. Commonly seen waterfowl are Canada geese, <b>tundra</b> swans, mallards, American black ducks and northern pintail.|$|E
5|$|Native trumpeter (Cygnus buccinator) and <b>tundra</b> swans (Cygnus columbianus) and {{non-native}} mute swans (Cygnus olor) may all {{be found}} on the lake in winter. <b>Tundra</b> swans are absent in summer as they migrate to the arctic and subarctic to nest, however, the non-native, Eurasian mute swans compete for habitat with the non-migrating trumpeter swan population and is an impediment to restoration of the native trumpeters around the Great Lakes. Additional native birds hosted by the lake include cardinals, blue jays, finches, orioles, woodpeckers, teal, mallards, resident and migratory Canada geese, and an occasional bald eagle.|$|E
5|$|The alpine meadows {{continue}} into the harsh alpine <b>tundra</b> zone, where poor soil, heavy snowfall, cold temperatures, {{and a very}} short growing season discourage all but the hardiest sedge grasses, heathers, and lichens.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tundra</b> {{occurs in}} the far Northern Hemisphere, north of the taiga belt, {{including}} vast areas of northern Russia and Canada.|$|E
5|$|While some {{glaciation}} {{occurred in}} the Carpathians during the ice ages, no glacial activity is recorded at Ciomadul. The volcano was unforested at that time, with steppe and <b>tundra</b> vegetation comprising most of the reported flora.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the highest}} {{tropical}} cordillera in the world, the Cordillera Blanca boasts {{a variety of}} ecosystems, from humid tropical through subalpine to alpine and <b>tundra.</b> The valleys and mountain slopes are covered with scattered high Andean forests and puna grassland.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens are {{omnivorous}} {{and highly}} opportunistic: their diet may vary widely with location, season and serendipity. For example, those foraging on <b>tundra</b> on the Arctic North Slope of Alaska obtained about half their energy needs from predation, mainly of microtine rodents, and half by scavenging, mainly of caribou and ptarmigan carcasses.|$|E
5|$|Since rain only falls as liquid, in frozen temperatures, rain cannot fall. As a result, {{very cold}} climates see very little {{rainfall}} {{and are often}} known as polar deserts. A common biome {{in this area is}} the <b>tundra</b> which has a short summer thaw and a long frozen winter. Ice caps see no rain at all, making Antarctica the world's driest continent.|$|E
5|$|T. m. migratorius, the {{nominate}} subspecies, breeds in the US and Canada, {{other than}} down the west coast, {{to the edge}} of the <b>tundra</b> from Alaska and northern Canada east to New England and then south to Maryland, northwest Virginia, and North Carolina. It winters in southern coastal Alaska, southern Canada, most of the US, Bermuda, the Bahamas and eastern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern European Plain {{encompasses}} Belarus {{and most}} of European Russia. The plain is mostly mountain-free and comprises several plateaus. Russia's northernmost regions are <b>tundra.</b> The Russian <b>Tundra</b> {{is located on the}} coastline with the Arctic and is known for its total darkness in the winter. Taiga reaches Russia's southern borders in Siberia and accounts for 60% of the country. Towards the Ural Mountains and in northern Kazakhstan, the climate is mostly temperate. South-West Russia and Kazakhstan are mostly steppe. The Kazakh steppe covers one-third of Kazakhstan and is the world's largest dry steppe region. Armenia is mostly mountainous and its climate is continental. The landlocked country shares no direct border with other members states. It is located in the south-western part of Asia, occupying the north-eastern part of the Armenian Plateau, and is located between the Caucasus and the Near East.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} pintail's breeding {{habitat is}} open unwooded wetlands, such as wet grassland, lakesides or <b>tundra.</b> In winter, it will utilise {{a wider range}} of open habitats, such as sheltered estuaries, brackish marshes and coastal lagoons. It is highly gregarious outside the breeding season and forms very large mixed flocks with other ducks.|$|E
5|$|The summit {{station of}} Mount Washington has an alpine climate or <b>tundra</b> climate (Köppen ET), {{although}} it receives an extremely high amount of precipitation, atypical for most regions with such cold weather. Lower elevations have a subarctic climate (Köppen Dfc).|$|E
5|$|Ants (family Formicidae in {{the order}} Hymenoptera) are the most species-rich of all social insects, with more than 12,000 {{described}} species and many others awaiting description. Formicidae is divided into 21 subfamilies, of which 17 contain extant taxa, while four are exclusively fossil. Ants have come to occupy virtually all major terrestrial habitats, {{with the exception of}} <b>tundra</b> and cold ever-wet forests. They display a wide range of social behaviors, foraging habits and associations with other organisms, which has generated scientific and public interest.|$|E
5|$|As many as 50,000 pink-footed geese, 13,000 Eurasian wigeon and 7,000 brent geese winter at Holkham, {{making it}} of {{international}} importance for these species. Up to 400 white-fronted geese {{and a few}} <b>tundra</b> bean geese may join the wildfowl flocks, and the odd peregrine falcon, short-eared owl, merlin, marsh harrier or hen harrier may hunt over the fields. The shingle banks and foreshore hold wintering flocks of shore larks, snow buntings and twite, and waders like knots, curlews, dunlins and grey plover probe for invertebrates in the mud flats.|$|E
5|$|Black Moshannon Lake and the bogs of the Natural Area are {{especially}} important to the IBA. They serve as a stopover for migratory waterfowl and shorebirds. Waterfowl observed at the park include pied-billed and Slavonian grebes, common loon, American black duck, ruddy duck, blue-winged and green-winged teal, <b>tundra</b> swan, long-tailed duck, hooded and red-breasted merganser, greater and lesser scaup, northern pintail, bufflehead, American wigeon, and northern shoveler.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes {{agree on}} a site for a nest, and both will defend the site. During this time, the male {{continues}} to feed the female. Mating occurs shortly after this. Breeding takes place in colonies on coasts, islands and occasionally inland on <b>tundra</b> near water. It often forms mixed flocks with the common tern. It lays from one to three eggs per clutch, most often two.|$|E
5|$|In 1982 Cohen {{approached}} May Cutler, {{founder of}} <b>Tundra</b> Books, {{to create an}} illustrated children's book of the story. It was published in 1984 as The Hockey Sweater, and by 2014 had sold over 300,000 copies. Following {{the success of the}} book, Cutler asked Carrier to write three more stories of his childhood to be illustrated by Cohen, each covering a different sport in a different season. They were published as The Boxing Champion (1991), The Longest Home Run (1994) and The Basketball Player (1996).|$|E
5|$|In {{continental}} Europe, C. graminis {{is widespread}} from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean Sea. It {{may also be}} found in central Asia and China. In Russia it may be found in the <b>tundra</b> zone from the Polar Urals to the Kolyma River, and in the nearby countries of Kazakhstan, and Mongolia. It is listed as vulnerable in Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, and in Germany it is rare in one district, endangered in another.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{widespread}} groups of mammals, rodents {{can be found on}} every continent except Antarctica. They are the only terrestrial placental mammals to have colonized Australia and New Guinea without human intervention. Humans have also allowed the animals to spread to many remote oceanic islands (e.g., the Polynesian rat). Rodents have adapted to almost every terrestrial habitat, from cold <b>tundra</b> (where they can live under snow) to hot deserts.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard has {{permafrost}} and <b>tundra,</b> {{with both}} low, {{middle and high}} Arctic vegetation. 165 species of plants have been found on the archipelago. Only those areas which defrost in the summer have vegetations, which accounts for about 10% of the archipelago. Vegetation is most abundant in Nordenskiöld Land, around Isfjorden and where affected by guano. While there is little precipitation, giving the archipelago a steppe climate, plants still have good access to water because the cold climate reduces evaporation. The growing season is very short, and may last only a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|The Köppen {{classification}} {{depends on}} average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The {{most commonly used}} form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. Specifically, the primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as rain forest, monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical, humid continental, oceanic climate, Mediterranean climate, steppe, subarctic climate, <b>tundra,</b> polar ice cap, and desert.|$|E
5|$|The Köppen {{classification}} {{depends on}} average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The {{most commonly used}} form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. These primary types are A) tropical, B) dry, C) mild mid-latitude, D) cold mid-latitude, and E) polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as rainforest, monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical, humid continental, oceanic climate, Mediterranean climate, desert, steppe, subarctic climate, <b>tundra,</b> and polar ice cap.|$|E
5|$|The animal {{tends to}} be found in rocky habitats. It {{occupies}} talus piles (collection of broken rock pieces at the base of cliffs, volcanoes, or valley shoulders, accumulated due to periodic rockfall from adjacent cliff faces) with larger stones and rocky areas although it does not inhabit swampy montane <b>tundra</b> or talus lacking vegetation. It may also live in burrows under tree roots or in old moss-scree.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} plant {{partners are}} reflected in the wide variety of habitats worldwide. Ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae have been observed in arctic and alpine <b>tundra,</b> boreal and alpine forest, north temperate forest, mires, mediterranean forests and scrub (maquis), miombo woodland, tropical lowland rainforest, tropical cloud forest, tropical dry forest, Australian eucalypt woodlands, and south temperate forests. Where they are introduced, they typically grow in plantations of their native host species, e.g. with pine in South Africa, Eucalyptus in Thailand, or birch in New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The north-south {{extent of}} the {{province}} (46°36'N to 60°22'N), prevalent westerly winds, cold ocean currents and local factors such as mountains and coastline combine to create the various climates of the province. Northern Labrador is classified as a polar <b>tundra</b> climate, southern Labrador {{is considered to be}} a subarctic climate while most of Newfoundland would be considered to be a cool summer subtype of a humid continental climate.|$|E
5|$|The pass {{is above}} tree line, so the {{surrounding}} terrain is alpine <b>tundra.</b> Open grassy expanses are occasionally broken by low shrubbery and bare patches of rock, {{particularly on the}} steep slope to the north. Snow lingers in some areas year-round. Adjacent to the road and parking area are small ephemeral pools on the southwest, with a larger, permanent one north of the road.|$|E
5|$|The {{summit of}} Mauna Kea lies above the tree line, and {{consists}} of mostly lava rock and alpine <b>tundra.</b> An area of heavy snowfall, it is inhospitable to vegetation, and {{is known as the}} Hawaiian tropical high shrublands. Growth is restricted here by extremely cold temperatures, a short growing season, low rainfall, and snow during winter months. A lack of soil also retards root growth, makes it difficult to absorb nutrients from the ground, and gives the area a very low water retention capacity.|$|E
5|$|Two {{sections}} of the province are not dominated by forest. The province's northeast corner bordering Hudson Bay is above the treeline and is considered <b>tundra.</b> The tallgrass prairie once dominated the south central and southeastern parts including the Red River Valley. Mixed grass prairie {{is found in the}} southwestern region. Agriculture has replaced much of the natural prairie but prairie still can be found in parks and protected areas; some are notable for the presence of the endangered western prairie fringed orchid,.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 260 {{species of birds}} have been recorded, with raptors such as the bald eagle, golden eagle, {{peregrine}} falcon, osprey and several species of hawks residing year round. The harlequin duck is a colorful species of waterfowl found in the lakes and waterways. The great blue heron, <b>tundra</b> swan, Canada goose and American wigeon are species of waterfowl more commonly encountered in the park. Great horned owl, Clark's nutcracker, Steller's jay, pileated woodpecker and cedar waxwing reside in the dense forests along the mountainsides, and in the higher altitudes, the ptarmigan, timberline sparrow and rosy finch {{are the most likely}} to be seen. The Clark's nutcracker is less plentiful than in past years due to the {{decline in the number of}} whitebark pines.|$|E
5|$|Antarctica, on average, is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has {{the highest}} average {{elevation}} of all the continents. Antarctica is a desert, with annual precipitation of only 200mm (8in) along the coast and far less inland. The temperature in Antarctica has reached −89.2°C (−128.6°F) (or even −94.7 as measured from space), though the average {{for the third quarter}} (the coldest part of the year) is −63°C (−81°F). Anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent. Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of algae, bacteria, fungi, plants, protista, and certain animals, such as mites, nematodes, penguins, seals and tardigrades. Vegetation, where it occurs, is <b>tundra.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the steep}} {{elevation}} increase around the pass, the vegetation graduates from sub-tropical forest at its base, to a temperate region, to a {{wet and dry}} alpine climate, and finally to cold <b>tundra</b> desert devoid of vegetation. Around Nathu La and the Tibetan side, the region has little vegetation besides scattered shrubs. Major species found in the region include dwarf rhododendrons (Rhododendron anthopogon, R. setosum) and junipers. The meadows include the genera Poa, Meconopsis, Pedicularis, Primula, and Aconitum. The region has a four-month growing season during which grasses, sedges, and medicinal herbs grow abundantly and support a host of insects, wild and domestic herbivores, larks, and finches. The nearby Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary has rare, endangered ground orchida and rhododendrons interspersed among tall junipers and silver firs.|$|E
5|$|Biomes {{are larger}} units of {{organization}} that categorize {{regions of the}} Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation. There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include tropical rainforest, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, temperate deciduous forest, taiga, <b>tundra,</b> hot desert, and polar desert. Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic microbiomes. To a microbe, {{the human body is}} a habitat and a landscape. Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in molecular genetics, which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet. The oceanic microbiome plays {{a significant role in the}} ecological biogeochemistry of the planet's oceans.|$|E
5|$|By about 15,000 years ago, Equus ferus was a {{widespread}} holarctic species. Horse bones {{from this time}} period, the late Pleistocene, are found in Europe, Eurasia, Beringia, and North America. Yet between 10,000 and 7,600 years ago, the horse became extinct in North America and rare elsewhere. The reasons for this extinction are not fully known, but one theory notes that extinction in North America paralleled human arrival. Another theory points to climate change, noting that approximately 12,500 years ago, the grasses characteristic of a steppe ecosystem gave way to shrub <b>tundra,</b> which was covered with unpalatable plants.|$|E
5|$|Few {{tasks were}} left to {{complete}} when the 1977 construction season began. Most of the pump stations had been turned over to operating personnel by construction workers, and environmental mitigation and cleanup {{was in full swing}} as Alyeska repaired <b>tundra</b> damage caused by construction. Associated-Green, which had performed its construction tasks well, was assigned the job of finishing the final touches on the main pipeline. The last 160 miles of hydrostatic testing were done, 33 remedial welds were completed, and 45 miles of pipe were insulated, among other tasks. Because the pace of construction was much slower than in 1976, fewer workers were needed. Fewer than 11,000 were employed at the peak of 1977 work, about half of 1976's total. On May 31, the final pipeline weld took place.|$|E
