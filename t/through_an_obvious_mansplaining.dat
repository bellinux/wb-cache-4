40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a class of}} depth-based classification procedures that are of a nearest-neighbor nature. Depth, after symmetrization, indeed provides the center-outward ordering that is necessary and sufficient to define nearest neigh-bors. The resulting classifiers are affine-invariant and inherit the nonparamet-ric validity from nearest-neighbor classifiers. In particular, we prove that the proposed depth-based classifiers are consistent under very mild conditions. We investigate their finite-sample performances through simulations and show that they outperform affine-invariant nearest-neighbor classifiers obtained <b>through</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> standardization construction. We illustrate the practical value of our classifiers on two real data examples. Finally, we shortly discuss the possible uses of our depth-based neighbors in other inference problems...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} model for construction {{and application of}} standardized load profiles. Standardized load profile curves give a typical natural gas consumption pattern throughout a year in various time resolutions. Our semiparametric regression model uses three types of information, constant characteristics of an individual customer, individual historical consumption and time varying explanatory variables, both to describe typical trend and to correct for departure of current conditions from normal. The model's multiplicative structure allows for convenient separation of individual-specific and common time varying parts. Although corrections are parametric, no substantial information about the typical consumption trend is available, so it is modelled non-parametrically. Corrections for temperature effects are non-linear; hence we deal with them <b>through</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> extension of the generalized additive model framework.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a class of}} depth-based classification procedures that are of a nearest-neighbor na- ture. Depth, after symmetrization, indeed provides the center-outward ordering that is necessary and sufficient to define nearest neighbors. Like all their depth-based competitors, the resulting classifiers are affine-invariant, hence in particular are insensitive to unit changes. Unlike the former, however, the latter achieve Bayes consistency under virtually any absolutely continuous distributions—a concept we call nonparametric consistency, to stress the difference with the stronger universal consistency of the standard kNN classifiers. We investigate the finite-sample performances of the proposed classifiers through simulations and show that they outperform affine-invariant nearest-neighbor classifiers obtained <b>through</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> standardization construction.

40|$|Octavian Paler’s essays {{celebrate}} culture, {{as a way}} {{of existence}} in the world, <b>through</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> inclination to the intellectual speculation and the righteous aspiration, through meditative solitude and solidary conscience, through memory, lucidity and rigor. Through the essay Paler seems to assume the myths and the essential problems of the entire world. He projects the myths into his inner world, contaminating them with his existential obsessions through which he assigns them his own judgments. Paler’s qualities as an essayist are also visible in the volume Scrisori imaginare (Imaginary Letters), that sums up a series of fictitious letters, messages addressed to some of Europe’s elected figures, such as Miguel de Unamuno, Albert Camus, Erasmus of Rotterdam, Franz Kafka, Marcel Proust, etc., to whom history mirrored itself differently.

On the other hand it is risky to say that religion has disappeared under the pressure of the modern days given the multitude of religious backgrounds it displays, from techniques to relate to the Divinity which are ancient or magical religious up to refined techniques created within a urban context. Under these circumstances, more and more often one refers to a false trail taken by those who postulate the decline of religion, to (just) a myth about the decline of religion, a huge mistake even by those who support the disappearance of the supernatural under the profound industrialization of present day society...|$|R

40|$|A {{granular}} material {{consists of an}} assemblage of particles with contacts newly formed or disappeared, changing the micromechanical structures during macroscopic deformation. These structures are idealized <b>through</b> <b>a</b> strain space multiple mechanism model as a twofold structure consisting of a multitude of virtual two-dimensional mechanisms, each of which consists of a multitude of virtual simple shear mechanisms of one-dimensional nature. In particular, a second-order fabric tensor describes direct macroscopic stress–strain relationship, and a fourth-order fabric tensor describes incremental relationship. In this framework of modeling, the mechanism of interlocking defined as the energy less component of macroscopic strain provides an appropriate bridge between micromechanical and macroscopic dilative component of dilatancy. Another bridge for contractive component of dilatancy is provided <b>through</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> hypothesis on micromechanical counterparts being associated with virtual simple shear strain. It is also postulated that the dilatancy along the stress path beyond a line slightly above the phase transformation line is only due to the mechanism of interlocking and increment in dilatancy due to this interlocking eventually vanishing for a large shear strain. These classic postulates {{form the basis for}} formulating the dilatancy in the strain space multiple mechanism model. The performance of the proposed model is demonstrated through simulation of undrained behavior of sand under monotonic and cyclic loading...|$|R
5000|$|A persona (plural personae or personas), in the word's {{everyday}} usage, is {{a social}} role or a character played by an actor. The word is derived from Latin, where it originally referred to a theatrical mask. The Latin word probably derived from the Etruscan word [...] "phersu", with the same meaning, and that from the Greek πρόσωπον (prosōpon). Its meaning in the latter Roman period changed to indicate a [...] "character" [...] of a theatrical performance or court of law, when {{it became apparent that}} different individuals could assume the same role, and legal attributes such as rights, powers, and duties followed the role. The same individuals as actors could play different roles, each with its own legal attributes, sometimes even in the same court appearance. According to other sources, which also admit that the origin of the term is not completely clear, persona could possibly be related to the Latin verb per-sonare, literally: sounding <b>through,</b> with <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> link to the above-mentioned theatrical mask.|$|R

This will include conventional media as well as a model for space-time foam arising from non-critical string theory. 1 The role of decoherence Until recently in elementary particle physics the environment was not con-sidered. Scatterings were calculated in a vacuum background and S-matrix elements were calculated within the paradigm of the standard gauge theory model. The latter is a successful theory overall. However, recently systems which oscillate coherently have been investigated with increasing precision, e. g. neutrino and neutral meson flavour oscillations.

40|$|Cobalt oxide {{nanostructure}} {{materials have}} been prepared by adding several concentrations of spectator Ni ions in solution, and analyzed by electron microscopy, X-day diffraction, calorimetry/thermogravimetric analysis, UV-vis absorption, Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electron microscopy {{results show that the}} morphology of the nanostructures is dramatically altered by changing the concentration of spectator ions. The bulk XRD patterns of 350 ºC-annealed samples indicate that the structure of the cobalt oxide is all of cubic Fd- 3 m Co 3 O 4, and show that the major XRD peaks shift slightly with the concentration of Ni ions. In Raman spectroscopy, we can confirm the XRD data <b>through</b> <b>a</b> more <b>obvious</b> change in peak position, broadness, and intensity. For the un-sputtered samples in the XPS measurement process, the XPS peaks of Co 2 p and O 1 s for the samples prepared without Ni ions exhibit higher binding energies than those for the sample prepared with Ni ions. Upon Ar+ ion sputtering, we found Co 3 O 4 reduces to CoO, on the basis of XPS data. Our study could be further applied to controlling morphology and surface oxidation state.

40|$|Extract] Developing a {{positive}} and healthy sexuality is central to being human. For most of us, our sexuality and sexual health is a private matter, yet for people with intellectual and developmental disability privacy is often not an option as support is required {{in this area of}} life, as in many other areas. This requirement presents a real dilemma for many of these men and women, their paid and unpaid caregivers, disability services, and for society in general. Funded developments in mainstream women's health promotion since the 1970 s have helped put the spotlight on the range of specifically gendered sexual issues for women with intellectual and developmental disability (e. g., Walsh & Heller, 2002). Even though Australia is the only country in the world with a funded male health policy, its publication in 2010 has not filtered <b>through</b> to throw <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> focus on any health issue, sexual or otherwise, for men with intellectual and developmental disability, and there is no sign that this is likely to change in the near future...|$|R

30|$|We {{consider}} an iterative design of independently operating local quantizers at nodes that should cooperate without interaction to achieve application objectives for distributed estimation systems. We suggest {{as a new}} cost function a probabilistic distance between the posterior distribution and its quantized one expressed as the Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence. We first present the analysis that minimizing the KL divergence in the cyclic generalized Lloyd design framework is equivalent to maximizing the logarithmic quantized posterior distribution on the average which can be further computationally reduced in our iterative design. We propose an iterative design algorithm that seeks to maximize the simplified version of the posterior quantized distribution and discuss that our algorithm converges to a global optimum due to the convexity of the cost function and generates the most informative quantized measurements. We also provide an independent encoding technique that enables minimization of the cost function and can be efficiently simplified for a practical use of power-constrained nodes. We finally demonstrate <b>through</b> extensive experiments <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> advantage of improved estimation performance {{as compared with the}} typical designs and the novel design techniques previously published.|$|R
