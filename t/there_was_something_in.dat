5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|He {{presented}} {{himself as a}} patrician, as the last Edwardian, as a Whig (in the tradition of his wife's family), as a romantic Tory, as intellectual, as a man shaped by the comradeship of the trenches and by the slump of the 1930s, as a shrewd man of business of bourgeois Scottish stock, and as a venerable elder statesman at home with modern youth. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> all these views, which he did little to discourage, and which commanded public respect into the early 1960s. Whether he was ever a mainstream Conservative, rather than a skillful exponent of the postwar consensus, is more doubtful.|$|E
25|$|The Doctor and Stark {{run down}} to the room where Rivesh and Seruba are, but find that Seruba is cradling Rivesh. She reveals that Azlok has mortally injured him and he is dying. However, Surbua says <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> the ship that could revive him, but Stark says that {{anything}} found in the ship was stored in the Area 51 vault, which hasn't been entered for some time as something got loose in there. The Doctor, Cassie, Jimmy, Seruba and Stark arrive at the vault, and the Doctor asks Jimmy and Cassie to find the TARDIS back at Dry Springs. Inside the vault, the Doctor and Seruba go {{and look for the}} device they need. Meanwhile, in the Viperox lair Azlok gets the Viperox Queen to release her newly hatched brood, so that they will destroy the whole town. Back in the vault, the Doctor comes across a swarm of Skorpius Flies, a carnivorous alien species that form a group mind. Seruba tells the Doctor she has found the device that could revive Rivesh, but the Skorpius Flies chase after them until the Doctor finds a crate and hides inside. He helps Seruba escape inside the crate by working out how many steps he took on the way in. At the Area 51 base Stark is informed that they are getting reports of Viperox attacks. He orders a row of tanks to block the Viperox off. The Doctor and Seruba shuffle out of the vault inside the crate so the flies won't notice. Meanwhile, Cassie and Jimmy are driving along with the TARDIS on the back of Jimmy's pickup truck when the Viperox burst out of the ground into their path.|$|E

500|$|Vane {{was widely}} {{recognized}} by contemporary chroniclers as a gifted administrator and a forceful orator. Even the royalist Clarendon had good words for him, and wrote {{of him as}} follows: [...] "He had an unusual aspect, which ... made men think <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> him of the extraordinary; and his whole life made good that imagination." [...] Also, Clarendon credited Vane with having possessed [...] "extraordinary parts, a pleasant wit, a great understanding, a temper not to be moved", and in debate [...] "a quick conception and a very sharp and weighty expression". [...] The 1662 biography The Life and Death of Sir Henry Vane the Younger by Vane's chaplain George Sikes included John Milton's [...] "Sonnet 17", written in 1652 in praise of Vane, and presented to Vane that year.|$|E

Shortly after, Goober and the Peas broke up, but Jack continued to play in other bands, such as the garage punk band The Go (he played lead guitar on their 1999 album Whatcha Doin'), The Hentchmen, and Two-Star Tabernacle. In 1997—allegedly on Bastille Day—Meg first began {{to learn to play}} the drums. In Jack's words, [...] "When she started to play drums with me, just on a lark, it felt liberating and refreshing. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> it that opened me up."

2500|$|With the {{exception}} of The Elephant Man and Dune, which are set in Victorian London and a fictitious galaxy respectively, all of Lynch's films have been set in the United States, and he has stated that [...] "I like certain things about America and it gives me ideas. When I go around and I see things, it sparks little stories, or little characters pop out, so it just feels right to me to, you know, make American films." [...] A number of his works, including Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Lost Highway are intentionally reminiscent of the 1950s American culture despite being set in the later decades of the 20th century. Lynch stated that [...] "It was a fantastic decade {{in a lot of}} ways... <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> the air that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, and not just because I was a kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things were going up instead of going down. You got the feeling you could do anything. The future was bright. Little did we know we were for a disastrous future." ...|$|E
2500|$|Youzhny {{was born}} on 25 June 1982 to Mikhail, a Soviet army colonel and Lubov, a {{professional}} tennis player. 25 June is also his father's birthday. His father sacrificed {{his career in the}} Soviet army to steer Youzhny and his older brother Andrei into becoming tennis players. It was because of his father that Boris Sobkin became his coach. At 13, he was a ballboy for a Russia – United States Davis Cup final in Moscow. Youzhny's father was recommended that Mikhail and his brother should join the tennis club Spartak Club if they wanted to become professional players. Mikhail and Andrei had to travel on an underground metro train and then on two buses to reach their destination, taking well over an hour to reach the club. His mother had to take a part-time job to pay for their club membership fees. At Spartak Club, Youzhny, along with many others his age, would watch Andrei Chesnokov, a former top-10 player, practice for hours. However, his parents had difficulty finding a good coach for Mikhail and Andrei. According to Mikhail, [...] "It was not so easy. In the beginning me and Andrei would watch how coaches were working with students. Then we would make our own drills with a bag of old balls that we collected." [...] Remembering Youzhny's early years, Sobkin said, [...] "Mischa and Andrei were practising together all the time without [...] coach". Sobkin continued: [...] "In the beginning, Mischa is all the time breaking racquets and crying. Not so many coaches want to work with boy with strong character like this. So, they would practise on one court for 15 minutes and then comes a member so they must leave court immediately and move to another court. Ten minutes maybe 20 minutes later comes another member and like this all day. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> Mischa's eyes, a sparkle, maybe, I don't know. Sometimes the eyes tells more than parents. Of course, I did not see Mischa is Top 10 player then. But I could see he had something special." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Truthmaker theorists {{claim that}} for every truth, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> virtue {{of which it is}} true—or, more cautiously, {{that for every}} truth in some {{specified}} class of truths, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> virtue of which it is true. I argue {{that it is hard to}} see how the thought that truth is grounded in reality lends any support to truthmaker theory. I. Truth is grounded in reality—or so it is appealing to think. Truthmaker theory attempts to articulate this idea precisely and put it to philosophical use. Truthmaker theorists claim that for every truth, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> virtue of which it is true—or, more cautiously, that for every truth in some specified class of truths, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> virtue of which it is true. These principles yield the conclusion that the world contains entities whose existence guarantees the truth of predications. They also provide arguments against phenomenalism, Ryleanism about dispositions, Rylean behaviourism, operationalism, presentism, and other philosophical theories. In the language of Sider (2001, § 2. 3), truthmaker theory offers a way of ‘catching cheaters’. In this paper, I argue that it is hard to see how the thought that truth is grounded i...|$|R
