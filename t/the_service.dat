30|$|Another factor behind labor {{share is}} the {{development}} of <b>the</b> <b>services</b> sector.

Reducing <b>the</b> biases against <b>the</b> <b>services</b> sector in terms of land allocation and entry barriers should also have a positive effect. However, the effects of these measures on labor income {{are most likely to be}} slow.|$|R
