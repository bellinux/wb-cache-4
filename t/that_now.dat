5|$|Chambersburg's {{settlement}} {{began in}} 1730 when water mills were {{built at the}} confluence of Conococheague Creek and Falling Spring Creek <b>that</b> <b>now</b> run {{through the center of}} the town. Its history includes episodes relating to the French and Indian War, the Whiskey Rebellion, John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, and the American Civil War. The borough was the only major northern community burned down by Confederate forces during the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{through an}} {{advertisement}} {{in the national}} press, contact was made between former paratroopers in Wiesbaden and four English ex-servicemen in Royal Tunbridge Wells. Through this contact the friendship <b>that</b> <b>now</b> exists between the two towns sprang up, leading to the signing in 1989 of the official Twinning Charter. Also through this the Tunbridge Wells Twinning and Friendship Association (TWTFA) was formed.|$|E

5|$|Jon and Tyrion see the Wall for {{the first}} time as they arrive with Benjen and the other recruits. En route to the Wall, Tyrion and Jon discuss the Night's Watch. Tyrion is quick to disabuse Jon of his romantic notions of the Watch as a noble calling battling the mythical horrors beyond the Wall (as it was in history), {{pointing}} out <b>that</b> <b>now</b> it is more a dumping ground for the unwanted of Westeros: criminals, prisoners, and bastards.|$|E
5|$|Nearby villages {{have been}} subsumed into the {{built-up}} {{area of the}} town, so <b>that</b> <b>now</b> it incorporates High Brooms to the north, Hawkenbury to the south, and Rusthall (whose name resonates with the iron content of the rocks) to the west.|$|E
5|$|The Kodokan moved {{once again}} during Kanō's lifetime, and on 21 March 1934, the Kodokan {{dedicated}} this 510-mat facility. Guests {{at the opening}} included the Belgian, Italian, and Afghan ambassadors to Japan. In 1958, when the Kodokan moved to its current eight story facility, <b>that</b> <b>now</b> has more than 1200 mats, the old building was sold to the Japan Karate Association.|$|E

5|$|The Triangle {{redevelopment}} happened slowly, {{with the}} first part — Raley Field — opening in 2000. Effective January 1, 2001, Caltrans relinquished SR 275 to West Sacramento between postmiles 12.4 (west of Riske Lane) and 13.0 (the west end of the Tower Bridge). The city renamed the road Tower Bridge Gateway and demolished the Riske Lane overpass in early 2007, {{replacing it with a}} signalized intersection <b>that</b> <b>now</b> serves the new Garden Street.|$|E
5|$|The Zytglogge's {{exterior}} was repainted by Gotthard Ringgli and Kaspar Haldenstein in 1607–10, {{who introduced}} the large clock faces <b>that</b> <b>now</b> dominate {{the east and}} west façades of the tower. The corner towerlets were removed again some time before 1603. In 1770–71, the Zytglogge was renovated by Niklaus Hebler and Ludwig Emanuel Zehnder, who refurbished the structure in order to suit the tastes of the late Baroque, giving the tower its contemporary outline.|$|E
5|$|The {{policy was}} relaxed {{somewhat}} {{in the final}} years of occupation (1943–44), in view of German military defeats and the approaching Eastern Front. The Germans hoped that a more lenient cultural policy would lessen unrest and weaken the Polish Resistance. Poles were allowed back into those museums <b>that</b> <b>now</b> supported German propaganda and indoctrination, such as the newly created Chopin museum, which emphasized the composer's invented German roots. Restrictions on education, theater and music performances were eased.|$|E

5|$|The present {{building}} is designed on a triangular plan. The large tower {{at the tip}} of the triangle is the medieval gatehouse, from which wings extend on either side. An isolated tower <b>that</b> <b>now</b> has the library on two floors divides the curtain wall on the east.|$|E

50|$|Highway 947 {{was first}} {{designated}} {{in the early}} 1970s, but in a different alignment. At that time, the highway began at Highway 16 within Edson. It traveled northeast using the general alignment <b>that</b> is <b>now</b> designated Highway 748, and then north to Swan Hills via Whitecourt using the general alignment <b>that</b> is <b>now</b> designated Highway 32. From Swan Hills, it continued north to Highway 2 using the general alignment <b>that</b> is <b>now</b> designated Highway 33.|$|R

5|$|Travel to {{the area}} before it was a {{national}} park was rare due to its remote location, lack of accommodations, {{and the absence of}} real roads in southern Utah. Old wagon roads were upgraded to the first automobile roads starting about 1910, and the road into Zion Canyon was built in 1917 leading to the Grotto, short of the present road <b>that</b> <b>now</b> ends at the Temple of Sinawava.|$|E
5|$|Although {{above the}} horizon and hence visible to the Ancient Greeks, Antlia's stars were too faint to have been {{included}} in any ancient constellations. The stars <b>that</b> <b>now</b> comprise Antlia lay within an area of the sky covered by the ancient constellation Argo Navis, the Ship of the Argonauts, which due to its immense size was split into several smaller constellations by Lacaille in 1763. Ridpath reports that due to their faintness, the stars of Antlia did not make up part of the classical depiction of Argo Navis.|$|E
5|$|At an eco {{hotel in}} the desert, Greene tells Medrano <b>that</b> <b>now</b> he {{controls}} the majority of Bolivia's water supply, Medrano must accept a new contract that makes Greene Planet Bolivia's sole water utility company at significantly higher rates. Bond infiltrates the complex, kills {{the chief of police}} (Fernando Guillén Cuervo) for betraying Mathis, and single-handedly assaults the hotel. After killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum, leaving him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil, wondering if Greene will get thirsty enough to drink it.|$|E

Hydra double-agent, and S.H.I.E.L.D. prisoner, Grant Ward tells Agent Skye of secret frequencies Hydra uses to communicate, and Agent Billy Koenig intercepts Creel's next directive—to use the family of Brigadier General Glenn Talbot as leverage to find the Obelisk. Agent Melinda May, Skye, Hunter, and Hartley help Talbot fight off Creel, before abducting Talbot and deceiving him into giving them access codes for a U.S. military base near Washington, D.C. that contains numerous confiscated S.H.I.E.L.D. assets.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{pushed for}} greater {{consultation}} and {{voice for the}} dominions, and succeeded in having Richard Casey appointed as a permanent political liaison in London who would have access to British government decisions and act as a conduit between Westminster and Melbourne. He also successfully lobbied {{for the creation of}} a Dominion Office separated out from the Colonial Office to acknowledge the different state of affairs <b>that</b> <b>now</b> existed in the Empire. However, while fellow dominions generally agreed that the imperial system should be modified, not all shared his vision for closer collaboration and strong ties. Canada and the Union of South Africa were instead seeking greater independence from London, and there was little enthusiasm for many of Bruce's more ambitious plans for inter-empire trade and policy cooperation.|$|E
5|$|By 10 October Toyoda's tour of {{the front}} was complete. He {{intended}} to depart from Formosa for Japan that same day but was forced to change his plans when Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher's Fast Carrier Task Force suddenly appeared to the north, launching strikes against the Ryukyu Islands. Toyoda could not risk a return trip home through a concentrated enemy carrier force <b>that</b> <b>now</b> embarked more than 1,000 aircraft, especially not after previous Combined Fleet commanders had been lost during aerial engagements. As a result, he was grounded far from Combined Fleet headquarters at a decisive moment. Out of position and with inadequate lines of communication, the response to such overwhelming enemy air power was left to Toyoda's Chief of Staff, Vice Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka.|$|E
