30|$|There <b>are</b> many <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> {{achieve our}} goal. <b>The</b> first <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> achieve per-station {{fairness}} among wireless clients. Therefore, the access point must equally allocate bandwidth to each wireless client. <b>The</b> second <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> achieve per-flow fairness between the uplink and downlink flows within a wireless station. <b>The</b> third <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> adaptively adjust <b>the</b> allocation of the uplink and downlink bandwidth for each wireless station, {{in order to}} allow a given communication direction to obtain larger bandwidth than the other. Finally, <b>the</b> fourth <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> adaptively re-allocate <b>the</b> remaining bandwidth to bandwidth-hungry wireless stations in order to increase link utilization.|$|R

25|$|A {{clean room}} is {{normally}} kept {{at a higher}} pressure than the external environment to keep contaminants out, and a biohazard laboratory is kept at a lower pressure to keep the biohazards in. <b>The</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> combine these in a single building.

25|$|Each {{category}} is distinguished by properties that all its objects have in common, {{such as the}} empty set or the product of two topologies, yet {{in the definition of}} a category, objects are considered atomic, i.e., we do not know whether an object A is a set, a topology, or any other abstract concept. Hence, <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> define special objects without referring to the internal structure of those objects. To define the empty set without referring to elements, or the product topology without referring to open sets, one can characterize these objects in terms of their relations to other objects, as given by the morphisms of the respective categories. Thus, the task is to find universal properties that uniquely determine the objects of interest.|$|E

25|$|To attain such speeds, Lockheed Martin {{has been}} collaborating with Aerojet Rocketdyne since 2006 on an {{appropriate}} engine. The company is developing the system from the scramjet-powered HTV-3X, which was canceled in 2008. The SR-72 is envisioned with an air-breathing hypersonic propulsion system that {{has the ability to}} accelerate from standstill to Mach6.0 using the same engine, making it about twice as fast as the SR-71. <b>The</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> design an engine to encompass the flight regimes of subsonic, supersonic and hypersonic speeds. Using turbine compression, turbojet engines can work at zero speed and usually perform best up to Mach 2.2. Ramjets, using aerodynamic compression with subsonic combustion, perform poorly under Mach 0.5 and are most efficient around Mach 3, being able to go up to around Mach 6. The SR-71's specially designed engines converted to low-speed ramjets by redirecting the airflow around the core and into the afterburner for speeds greater than Mach 2.5. Finally, scramjets with supersonic combustion cover the range of high supersonic to hypersonic speeds. The SR-72 is to use a turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) system to use a turbine engine at low speeds and a scramjet engine at high speeds. The turbine and ramjet engines share common inlet and nozzle, with different airflow paths in between.|$|E
500|$|Nearly all the {{gasoline}} {{sold in the}} United States today is mixed with 10 percent ethanol, a mix known as E10, and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends. Ford, DaimlerChrysler, and GM are among the automobile companies that sell flexible-fuel cars, trucks, and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85% ethanol (E85). <b>The</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> expand the market for biofuels beyond the farm states {{where they have been}} most popular to date. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, which calls for [...] of biofuels to be used annually by 2012, will also help to expand the market.|$|E
500|$|The {{situation}} was compounded as successive {{generations of the}} family expunged and sanitized the already opaque details of Austen's biography. The heirs of Jane's brother, Admiral Francis Austen, destroyed more letters; details were excised from the [...] "Biographical Notice" [...] her brother wrote in 1818; and family details continued to be elided or embellished in her nephew's A Memoir of Jane Austen, published in 1869, and in William and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh's biography Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters, published in 1913. The legend the family and relatives created reflects their biases in favour of [...] "good quiet Aunt Jane", portraying a woman whose domestic {{situation was}} happy and whose family was the mainstay of her life. Austen scholar Jan Fergus explains that modern biographies tend to include details excised from the letters and family biographical materials, but that <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> avoid the polarising view that Austen experienced periods of deep unhappiness and was [...] "an embittered, disappointed woman trapped in a thoroughly unpleasant family." ...|$|E

500|$|Having {{criticized the}} idea that {{semantic}} evaluation concerns only the internal relations between the units of a symbolic system, Fodor can adopt an externalist position with respect to mental content and meaning. For Fodor, in recent years, the problem of naturalization of the mental {{is tied to the}} possibility of giving [...] "the sufficient conditions for which a piece of the world is relative to (expresses, represents, is true of) another piece" [...] in non-intentional and non-semantic terms. If this goal is to be achieved within a representational theory of the mind, then <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> devise a causal theory which can establish the interpretation of the primitive non-logical symbols of the LOT. Fodor's initial proposal is that what determines that the symbol for [...] "water" [...] in Mentalese expresses the property H2O is that the occurrences of that symbol are in certain causal relations with water. The intuitive version of this causal theory is what Fodor calls the [...] "Crude Causal Theory". According to this theory, the occurrences of symbols express the properties which are the causes of their occurrence. The term [...] "horse", for example, says of a horse that it is a horse. In order to do this, it is necessary and sufficient that certain properties of an occurrence of the symbol [...] "horse" [...] be in a law-like relation with certain properties which determine that something is an occurrence of horse.|$|E
