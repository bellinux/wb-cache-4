25|$|Bradman {{had only}} made 28, {{when he played}} Bill Voce into the slips. Jack Ikin caught the ball and threw it {{high in the air}} in joy. He had caught the great Bradman, and Australia, he thought, were three down for under a hundred on a good wicket. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> looked to Ikin, to some of the other English players and some of the crowd, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> looked to me sitting {{watching}} from the dressing room. Bradman, however, thought it was a bump ball and he stayed, as he was fully entitled to do if there was any doubt in his mind... the umpire gave him not out and he went on to make 187 of Australia's total of 645.|$|E
500|$|Dallas was {{the first}} woman on City Council, which brought challenges, not least of which was {{determining}} how other council members would treat her. She began by insisting that they not call her [...] "Mrs. Dallas." [...] and that they use the title [...] "councilman," [...] not [...] "councilwoman," [...] since <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was written in the city charter. [...] "In private life, I'm Mrs. George Dallas," [...] she told a reporter shortly after the election, [...] "but in public life I'm Constance H. Dallas. I object to the use of Mrs." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{making the}} album, Yellowcard had also {{developed}} a character, Holly Wood, {{who served as a}} narrator and protagonist for the album's storyline. The character is featured in the songs [...] "Rough Landing, Holly" [...] and [...] "Holly Wood Died". The band explained the meaning of the title track, which they said is based on a [...] "whirlwind rocker about the pressures on the band members" [...] and how they have changed as they have aged after the release of Ocean Avenue. Key also commented that when he was preoccupied with making the album, there were distractions while in the process; he simply referred to the distractions as [...] "lights and sounds", which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album just that. He also says that the main reason behind <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> affected the band during that particular time.|$|E
5000|$|His {{last name}} {{sometimes}} appears as [...] "Dwinelle," [...] and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> spelled on his gravestone.|$|R

500|$|In {{addition}} to literature, the episode spoofs the Ocean's Trilogy, a film series {{about a group}} of criminals that heist casinos. Selman revealed to Entertainment Weekly in January 2011 that the episode is essentially about [...] "Homer and some people in Springfield hav to perpetrate an Ocean's Eleven–style heist in the non-Ocean's Eleven world of children’s fantasy book publishing." [...] Throughout the episode as the story progresses, title cards with titles such as [...] "The Crew", [...] "The Setup", [...] "The Heist", and [...] "The Payday" [...] appear. During these title cards, which last for about three to four seconds each, a version of the song [...] "Gritty Shaker" [...] by David Holmes is heard. This song was played for approximately three minutes during a scene in Ocean's Eleven. On his blog, The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma wrote that Selman wanted [...] "Gritty Shaker" [...] to be played repeatedly throughout [...] "The Book Job" [...] because he erroneously thought <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was done in film. During the heist of TweenLit Inc.'s headquarters, the screen splits in several ways, showing the different team members making their way to the printing room. According to Selman, [...] "the set-up and feel [...] is a real creative departure for us. It's sort of a heist movie where the heist is writing a book but when that kicks in, there's a giant stylistic leap. It's also a little sillier, a little more stylistic than most episodes. We're coming up on 500 episodes, but really, {{this is the kind of}} episode a show would only do if hadn't already had a couple hundred episodes." [...] Cuban American actor Andy García, who appeared in the Ocean's Trilogy as casino owner Terry Benedict, guest starred in [...] "The Book Job" [...] as the book publishing executive. At the end of January 2011, the recording of his performance took place.|$|E

50|$|Jane Harper, {{played by}} Georgina Walker. Beautiful, mysterious, bitchy and intimidating, Jane was the golden girl of the neighbourhood, {{the girl who}} had everything...or at least <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> seemed.|$|R
60|$|CRICHTON (acquiescing). Yes, my lord, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> {{all came}} about quite {{naturally}} in England. We {{had nothing to}} do with it there, and we shall have as little to do with it here.|$|E

'With that {{he strode}} {{down the hill}} to the corner of the Great Woods--Woods Corner, you call it now--to the very place where he had first landed--and I heard him moving through the {{thickets}} towards Horsebridge for a little, and then he was gone. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> happened. I saw it.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{would have}} spoken further, {{but at this}} moment the world came to an end. At least, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> sounded.

60|$|Nor is it {{necessary}} in these well-ordered days to discover the gold for one's self. One might have lived a lifetime on the farm, as Tomlinson's father had, and never discover it for one's self. For that indeed the best medium of destiny is a geologist, let us say the senior professor of geology at Plutoria University. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> happened.|$|E
60|$|I have narrated {{elsewhere}} how in {{the course}} of time the rejected MS. became Mrs. Annie Besant's excuse for lending me her ever helping hand by publishing it as a serial in a little propagandist magazine of hers. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> got loose beyond all possibility of recapture. It is out of my power now to stand between it and the American public: all I can do is to rescue it from unauthorized mutilations and make the best of a jejune job.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{one thing}} which I cannot understand," [...] he said, [...] "and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the constables {{happened}} to be so close at hand, just {{at the time they}} were wanted." ...|$|R

6000|$|This {{shock to}} Mary {{was more than}} he could endure. [...] "You can drop it," [...] he said with a sigh. So I dropped the letter, as I think I have already mentioned; and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> all began.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--we {{helped a}} little in that," [...] said Stalky. [...] "I did owe Beetle two and fourpence at least, Beetle says I did, but I never {{intended}} to pay him. Then we started {{a bit of an}} argument on the stairs, and--and Mr. Prout dropped into it accidental. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was, Padre. He paid me cash down like a giddy Dook (stopped it out of my pocket-money just the same), and Beetle gave him my note-of-hand all correct. I don't know what happened after that." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> began. How it {{was that}} it ended, {{as we know it}} did end, is not so easy to state precisely. It is very clear that Heyst was not indifferent, I won't say to the girl, but to the girl's fate. He was the same man who had plunged after the {{submerged}} Morrison whom he hardly knew otherwise than by sight and through the usual gossip of the islands. But this was another sort of plunge altogether, and likely to lead to {{a very different kind of}} partnership.|$|E
60|$|O'FLAHERTY. I {{never told}} her one word that wasn't the {{truth and nothing but}} the truth. I told her I was going to fight for the French and for the Russians; and sure who ever heard of the French or the Russians doing {{anything}} to the English but fighting them? <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was, sir. And sure the poor woman kissed me and went about the house singing in her old cracky voice that the French was on the sea, and they'd be here without delay, and the Orange will decay, says the Shan Van Vocht.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] Bella nodded corroboration. [...] "But {{it was not}} {{the matter}} of a husband, but of a horse. I wanted to borrow a horse from Uncle John, and Uncle John said yes. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> all happened." ...|$|R

50|$|Growling - Growling <b>is</b> a {{technique}} <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> sounds.

6000|$|... "Oh, {{that was}} the same story over again. Some of the tribe wandered away to the south a few hundred years ago, and one of them, wishing to have good luck for the enterprise, got into the temple at night and carried off one of the ears. There has been a {{tradition}} among the negroes ever since that the ear would come back some day. The fellow who carried it was caught by some slaver, no doubt, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> got into America, and so into your hands--and you have had the honour of fulfilling the prophecy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stab me! You {{must have}} been. And in that three months {{the world has}} {{undergone}} some changes." [...] Briefly he added an account of them. King James was fled to France, and living {{under the protection of}} King Louis, wherefore, and for other reasons, England had joined the league against her, and was now at war with France. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> happened that the Dutch Admiral's flagship had been attacked by M. de Rivarol's fleet that morning, from which it clearly followed that in his voyage from Cartagena, the Frenchman must have spoken some ship that gave him the news.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, by chance. There {{were lots}} of places in construing, where I should have broken down if I had {{happened}} to be set on in them; {{it was only a}} wonder I did not in that chorus, for I had only looked at it twice; but Everard asked me nothing but what I knew; and now and then I get into a funny state, when nothing is too hard for me, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was yesterday evening.

5000|$|Although {{terrified of}} losing him, Sofia Kolchak (Anna Kovalchuk) offers {{to leave for}} Petrograd and let her husband be with Anna if he so desires.
