5|$|Over {{the years}} I {{have found that}} it is {{difficult}} if not impossible to bring to consciousness of another person the nature of his tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them. This became painfully evident <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled. It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation. One must await the right time for conceptual change.|$|E
500|$|During later {{interviews}} {{he spoke}} about Strasberg and the Studio's effect on his career. [...] "The Actors Studio meant so much <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life. Lee Strasberg hasn't been given the credit he deserves... Next to Charlie, it sort of launched me. It really did. That was a remarkable turning point in my life. It was directly responsible for getting me to quit all those jobs and just stay acting." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1896 Yeats moved again, {{into a small}} flat in Woburn Place, {{so as to be}} {{nearer to}} her. Finally after a charged bed-buying session, with Yeats {{describing}} [...] "an embarrassed conversation upon the width", and his nervousness preventing them at first from becoming lovers, he eventually wrote in January 1896, [...] "at last she came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> thirtieth year.... and we had many days of happiness". Yeats' happiness is apparent in the poems he wrote at that period, and for the duration of their affair, Olivia appears to have acted as a muse to the poet.|$|E

500|$|Musically, Love's {{work with}} Hole and her solo {{efforts have been}} {{characterized}} as alternative rock; Hole's early material, however, was described by critics as being stylistically closer to grindcore and aggressive punk rock. Spins October 1991 review of Hole's first album noted Love's layering of harsh and abrasive riffs buried more sophisticated musical arrangements. In 1998, Love stated that Hole had [...] "always been a pop band. We always had a subtext of pop. I always talked about it, if you go back... what'll sound like some weird Sonic Youth tuning back then to you was sounding like the Raspberries <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> demented pop framework".|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Domínguez {{signed with}} the Atlanta Beat in the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA), the top division of professional soccer in the United States at the time. She was the first Mexican-born player to sign with the league {{since its inception in}} 2001. During her first month with the team, she was named the league's Player of the Month after scoring five goals and two assists in three games. [...] She scored seven goals during the 2003 season and was a leading scorer in the league. Of her experience, she said, [...] "It's very special for me to be in the top scoring position in this league. It's the best thing that has happened <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> career, right up there with scoring in the 1999 Women's World Cup." [...] The Beat finished second in the standings with a 9–4–8 record.|$|E
500|$|During {{the run of}} Sunset Boulevard at the West End's Adelphi Theatre in 1995, Paige {{discovered}} a lump in her breast, prompting her to consult her doctor, who at first reassured her {{there was nothing to}} be concerned about. She returned twice, and her doctor subsequently sent her for tests that confirmed the lump was cancerous, nine months after she discovered it. Continuing her role in the production Paige did not miss a show, and stated, [...] "When I did the show I became very emotional. Some of the lyrics suddenly took on an entirely different meaning. Words like, 'as if we never said goodbye' became more real". [...] Paige went in for day surgery on a Sunday due to her theatre commitments, had five years of medical treatment and completed a radiation programme. She spoke for the first time of her encounter with breast cancer in a 2004 interview, and has since described the period as [...] "the most awful thing that's happened <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life".|$|E

500|$|For {{the title}} role, King {{required}} the candidate be British, and considered casting an unknown actress. British actress Emily Blunt read the script, and aware other actresses would {{fight for the}} part, she approached King early in the search process. Blunt later admitted she had a [...] "non-existent knowledge" [...] of the queen, but after consulting her mother about Victoria's successful marriage, Blunt told King that the queen [...] "was a young girl who was very in love for the first time, {{and she was in}} a job where she felt way over her head. So I said to Graham, 'She's rebellious. She's a survivor.' I didn't want to approach her as the English rose, but as a young girl who was fighting". They awarded Blunt the role after viewing her entire filmography as well as her Golden Globes acceptance speech for Gideon's Daughter. Blunt noted, [...] "I thought [...] was remarkable and such a challenge. This young girl, who was so feisty and emotional and strong-willed, was very fascinating <b>to</b> <b>me...</b> <b>In</b> <b>my</b> life and in the job I've chosen to do, you have to perform all the time. And I thought Victoria was a bit of an actress." [...] After winning the part, Blunt was allowed access to Windsor Castle, where she viewed Victoria's paintings, letters, diaries, and music composed by Albert himself.|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{came up with}} Letter to My Daughter, {{which became}} a New York Times bestseller, while going through old boxes of notes and papers full of {{concepts}} for future books and poems, which she called [...] "WIP" [...] ("Works in Progress"). She found twenty years worth of notes written to her friend Oprah Winfrey, and realized that she should put the essays they inspired into a book so that others could read them. Although she had no daughters, and {{gave birth to a}} son (Guy Johnson), which she called [...] "the {{best thing that ever happened}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life", many women in Angelou's career looked to her as a mother figure. She wrote Letters to speak to those women and to share with them the wisdom she has gained throughout her long life. According to writer Gary Younge of The Guardian, most of the essays [...] "end with the kind of wisdom that, depending on your taste, qualifies as either homespun or hokey". For example, she uses what has been called her most famous statement, when speaking of Cuban artist Celia Cruz: [...] "We are more alike than unalike". Although Angelou discounts the idea when he brings it up to her, Younge thinks Letter reads like an extended farewell; in her 500-word introduction she mentions death twice.|$|E
500|$|While {{preparing}} the acoustic album, Grohl {{decided that he}} would improve it with guest appearances, and made a list of musicians {{that he would like to}} work with, such as Warren Haynes and Grant Hart. The guests that appeared on the record included Norah Jones, John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin fame, and Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age. John Paul Jones agreed to appear as he was in Los Angeles for the Grammy Awards, and Grohl described his appearance as the [...] "second-greatest thing to happen <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life" [...] behind his marriage. Norah Jones was brought for the bossa nova [...] "Virginia Moon" [...] after Grohl heard her record and considered that his song was [...] "her vibe" [...] and Jones' voice [...] "was so smooth and warm that I figured it would work out great with mine." [...] The song features Grohl's guitar technician Joe Beebe on lead guitar as he was the only one in the crew with jazz experience. The Wallflowers' keyboard player Rami Jaffee and that dog.'s violinist Petra Haden also contributed to the album, and were later drafted for the Foo Fighters' touring band. After the album was finished, Grohl stated that he hoped that the Foo Fighters were most remembered for this record, describing it as [...] "just the most fucking kick-ass thing we've ever done", and saying that [...] "If someone asked me which Led Zeppelin album to buy, I would tell them Physical Graffiti, because it has such a wide dynamic and it shows the range that band had. And that's what we wanted to do with this album." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{word was}} used heavily by John Arcilla's {{character}} in the 2015 Philippine epic film Heneral Luna in lines such as [...] "Ingles-inglesin mo ko sa bayan ko?! Punyeta!" [...] (Speaking English <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own country? What nerve!). Ambeth R. Ocampo, writing in the Philippine Daily Inquirer, criticized the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) for giving the film a R-13 rating despite {{the use of this}} word and others just because the swear words were Spanish-derived. Other observers have described punyeta as being as obscene as putang ina mo.|$|E

Louis recalled the moments after his victory: [...] "That hour was something unimaginable and it still appears <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> memory like a dream … Twigs and flowers were raining down on me.
