5|$|After the new Burgundians realise {{they are}} not subject to post-war {{rationing}} or other bureaucratic restrictions, the district is quickly flooded with black marketeers and shoppers; Spiller is unable to handle the rising problems by himself. In response, the British authorities surround the Burgundian territory with barbed wire. The residents retaliate against what <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> heavy-handed bureaucratic action; they stop a London Underground train as it passes through Burgundy, and ask to see passports of all passengers: those without documents are unable to proceed.|$|E
5|$|Debates {{over the}} origin of falafel have {{sometimes}} devolved into political discussions {{about the relationship between}} Arabs and Israelis. In modern times, falafel has been considered a national dish of Egypt, Palestine, and of Israel. Resentment exists amongst many Palestinians for what <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> the appropriation of their dish by Israelis. Additionally, the Lebanese Industrialists' Association has raised assertions of copyright infringement against Israel concerning falafel.|$|E

5|$|The eyes of {{slow lorises}} are forward-facing, which gives stereo vision. Their eyes {{are large and}} possess a {{reflective}} layer, called the tapetum lucidum, that improves low-light vision. It is possible that this layer blurs the images <b>they</b> <b>see,</b> <b>as</b> the reflected light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning they see in shades of only one color. They lack the opsin gene {{that would allow them}} to detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green.|$|E

Kyle Rogers of the Council of Conservative Citizens has also criticized the website for reprinting its material. Anglin has also been criticized for his relationships with non-white women in the Philippines, and for his insults towards white women on his website.|$|E

The book traces the history of U.S. foreign policy and military successes and failures from Franklin Roosevelt's administration through the Obama administration. The authors {{tell the story of}} what they describe as the unique role the United States has played as a defender of freedom throughout the world since World War II. Drawing upon the notion of American exceptionalism, the co-authors criticize Barack Obama's and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's foreign policies, and offer what <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> the solutions needed to restore American greatness and power on the world stage in defense of freedom.|$|E

5|$|To {{support their}} {{categorization}} of certain films as noirs and their rejection of others, many critics {{refer to a}} set of elements <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> marking examples of the mode. The question of what constitutes the set of noir's identifying characteristics is a fundamental source of controversy. For instance, critics tend to define the model film noir as having a tragic or bleak conclusion, but many acknowledged classics of the genre have clearly happy endings (e.g., Stranger on the Third Floor, The Big Sleep, Dark Passage, and The Dark Corner), while the tone of many other noir denouements is ambivalent. Some critics perceive classic noir's hallmark as a distinctive visual style. Others, observing that there is actually considerable stylistic variety among noirs, instead emphasize plot and character type. Still others focus on mood and attitude. No survey of classic noir's identifying characteristics can therefore be considered definitive. In the 1990s and 2000s, critics have increasingly turned their attention to that diverse field of films called neo-noir; once again, there is even less consensus about the defining attributes of such films made outside the classic period.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, the Right {{had shifted}} {{to support the}} newly rich in some European {{countries}} (particularly England) and instead of favouring the nobility over industrialists, favoured capitalists over the working class. Other right-wing, such as Carlism in Spain and nationalist movements in France, Germany and Russia, remained hostile to capitalism and industrialism. However, {{there are still a}} few right-wing movements today, notably the French Nouvelle Droite, CasaPound and American paleoconservatives, that are often in opposition to capitalist ethics and the effects they have on society as a whole, which <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> infringing upon or causing the decay of social traditions or hierarchies that <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> essential for social order.|$|E
25|$|Since its founding, the ULA has {{constantly}} {{engaged in}} its own brand of “literary activism” which has gained the group a notoriety for exposing what <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> corruption in the American literary world and for harshly criticizing corporate-promulgated literary fiction.|$|E

25|$|The Albanian Urban Lyric Song is a {{tradition}} that started in Albania in the 18th century but culminated in the 1930s.

5000|$|Cultural {{liberalism}} is {{a liberal}} view of society that stresses the freedom of individuals from cultural norms. It is often expressed, {{in the words of}} Thoreau, as the right to [...] "march to the beat of a different drummer." [...] Cultural liberals believe that society should not impose any specific code of behavior, and <b>they</b> <b>see</b> themselves <b>as</b> defending the moral rights of nonconformists to express their own identity however <b>they</b> <b>see</b> fit, <b>as</b> long as they do not harm anyone.|$|R
25|$|Many {{contemporary}} Republicans voice {{support of}} strict constructionism, the judicial philosophy that the Constitution {{should be interpreted}} {{as close to the}} original intent as is practicable.

25|$|Shareholders and investors, through {{socially}} responsible investing, {{are using their}} capital to encourage behavior they consider responsible. However, definitions of what constitutes ethical behavior vary.

25|$|Some critics {{dispute the}} {{portrayal}} of aging as a disease. For example, Leonard Hayflick, who determined that fibroblasts are limited to around 50cell divisions, reasons that aging is an unavoidable consequence of entropy. Hayflick and fellow biogerontologists Jay Olshansky and Bruce Carnes have strongly criticized the anti-aging industry in response to what <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> unscrupulous profiteering {{from the sale of}} unproven anti-aging supplements.|$|E
