25|$|Standard Tranz Metro logos {{were applied}} along {{the centre of}} the car sides. The car numbers were painted in black Frutiger script on the ends of the car, {{underneath}} the left-hand <b>tail</b> <b>lamp.</b> The end numbers were painted in the same style on {{the centre of the}} cab doors.|$|E
25|$|The 1991 {{model year}} had little {{news for the}} Premier except for a new {{anti-lock}} braking system (ABS) that was also available on the Canadian-built Dodge Monaco twin. The new safety feature came standard on the ES Limited and was optional on other models. The Limited model received a new front grille and rear <b>tail</b> <b>lamp</b> assemblies.|$|E

25|$|The Ninja 300 {{is based}} on the Ninja 250R, a {{lightweight}} and inexpensive sport bike in production for over three decades. Like the Ninja 250R, it has a full fairing, but a wider rear tire, 140/70, than the instead of 130/70 on the 250R. The Ninja 300 also has a LED <b>tail</b> <b>lamp,</b> 5 spoke wheels, neutral finder, and optional ABS.By comparison with the 250R, the Ninja 300 also has a slightly smaller fuel tank, taller gearing, and a back-torque-limiting slipper clutch with an assist mechanism that decreases clutch lever effort. Despite being a sport bike, it has comfortable ergonomics (such as windscreen effectively protecting from wind blast) which promotes commuting.|$|E
500|$|Holden's {{emphasis}} on fuel economy extended beyond powertrains, with a fuel consumption vacuum gauge replacing the tachometer throughout the range, although {{this could be}} optioned back with the sports instrumentation package. Visual changes were limited: the relocation of the corporate crest to {{the centre of the}} redesigned grille, black-coloured trim applied to the <b>tail</b> <b>lamp</b> surrounds on sedans, and the embossment of model badging into the side rubbing strips. The previously undesignated base car, was now the Commodore L, opening up the range for a new unbadged sub-level car. This delete option model, was de-specified and available only to fleet customers. On the premium Commodore SL/E, a resurrected [...] "Shadowtone" [...] exterior paint option became available in a limited range of dark-over-light colour combinations. According to contemporary reviews, changes made to the VC's steering produced a heavier feel and inclined understeer, while the revised suspension gave a softer ride and addressed concerns raised while riding fully laden.|$|E

2500|$|Between 2009 and 2010, {{development}} {{took place}} on further updates to the second generation S-197. In late 2010 design work (by Robert Gelardi) was frozen, with prototypes being first spotted in May 2011. On November 2, 2011, Ford unveiled the 2013 model year Mustang. The 2013 model year Mustang exterior was updated with a new front fascia featuring a larger grille, standard HID headlamps and two LED accent strips adjacent to the headlamp lens. Models equipped with the Pony Package offered LED lighting mounted on the sideview mirrors that produce a projection of a running horse on the ground, 18" [...] wheels, and lower valence foglamps. In the rear, LED <b>tail</b> <b>lamp</b> clusters included sequential turn signals (as with 2010-2012 Mustangs) and a reverse indicator light integrated within the brake light. The trunk lid included a black panel that united {{the left and right}} <b>tail</b> <b>lamp</b> clusters. Several new wheel designs were offered.|$|E
2500|$|Toyota {{introduced}} a refreshed [...] "regular" [...] Camry XV40 design in January 2009 at the North American International Auto Show. Visual changes include an updated front fascia, including grille and bumper with larger air intakes, larger projector headlamps, redesigned <b>tail</b> <b>lamp</b> lenses incorporating LEDs on all models (previously hybrids only), and revised wheel trims among other design changes. The interior received revised trim, improved power window switches, and a revamped audio system. The audio system now supports satellite radio (in North America) and added USB connectivity, with the dashboard-mounted screen now integrating a backup camera for models fitted with satellite navigation.|$|E
2500|$|The JP series update succeeded the JM from August 1995. A new grille insert with dual [...] "U"-shaped {{apertures}} tied in {{with the}} existing VS Commodore range. The redesigned Holden logo was also relocated from the JM's grille position to the bonnet, and the rear-end was treated to white <b>tail</b> <b>lamp</b> pin striping. At the same time, the model range was revised, the GS wagon removed, and manual transmission could now only be specified {{in conjunction with the}} SLX four-cylinder. The availability of ABS was also extended to these four-cylinder models, with four-wheel disc brakes now fitted across the board. In addition to this, remote central locking came standard to the SLX along with rear head restraints. Further enhancements were also made for the GS's sound system.|$|E

2500|$|The 1974 {{model year}} saw more {{revisions}} to the Torino line. Government safety regulations now required that the rear bumpers must also meet the [...] standard, so all Torinos had the rear bumper and <b>tail</b> <b>lamp</b> panel redesigned. The new rear bumpers were much larger, square shaped, and sat lower on the body. No longer was there a roll pan located below the bumper as on the 1972–73 models. The tail lights were beveled rectangular wrap-around units which eliminated the need for rear side marker lights. The fuel filler neck moved to a position above the bumper, rather than below as on 1972–73 models. It was now behind an access door {{in the center of}} the tail light panel just below the trunk lock, rather than behind the licence plate. The front fascia for Gran Torinos was revised for 1974. The new grille was of similar shape to the 1973, but was slightly larger and divided into 8 equal sized vertical sections. The grille had a much finer mesh pattern with vertical parking lamps in the outer sections embossed with the grille pattern on the surface of the lens. The grille emblem was changed and the front bumper was revised to be slightly more pointed, and the bumper guards were moved more towards the center of the bumper compared to 1973 models. The license plate bracket was relocated to the driver's side of the bumper. Torino models carried on with the same front fascia as 1973; however, its front bumpers were revised similarly to the Gran Torinos and the license plate remained in the center. Gran Torino Broughams featured a full width red lens across the rear, but the centre portion was non-functional. Broughams and Squires had a stand-up hood ornament inplace of the emblem on the grille.|$|E

5000|$|The {{requirement}} to send [...] "Train Out Of Section" [...] is that train {{has passed the}} clearing point complete with <b>tail</b> <b>lamp</b> attached.

50|$|Exterior {{changes on}} the Hardtop version {{includes}} a slanted nose which requires a new grille, a thinner headlamp assembly that match the slanted nose, frameless door windows, thinner <b>tail</b> <b>lamp,</b> front fenders and bumper.
