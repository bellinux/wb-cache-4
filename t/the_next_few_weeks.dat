40|$|We prove {{a version}} of the Cohen [...] Lenstra {{conjecture}} over function fields (completing the results of our prior paper).

Comment: This article has been temporarily withdrawn owing to a gap which affects Section 6, 12 and some theorems of the introduction: the homological stabilization maps used in this paper and the previous paper are not exactly the same.

Steps taken in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> days and <b>weeks</b> will decisively shape the post-Qaddafi order. The new, still nascent, Libyan leadership, faces a dual, difficult legacy which it will need to overcome: four decades of an autocratic regime that failed to build genuine state institutions and six months {{of a civil war}} that, together with inevitable human and material losses, exposed old divisions and fissures while prompting new ones. The challenge for that leadership, as well as for international actors who enabled its drive into Tripoli, is threefold: to establish a broadly inclusive and representative transitional governing body; address immediate security risks; and find an appropriate balance between, on the one hand, the search for accountability and justice and, on the other, the imperative of avoiding arbitrary score-settling and revenge.

30|$|Irrespective {{of storage}} conditions, {{the rates of}} {{respiratory}} CO 2 release of log sections remained high {{during the first two}} weeks post harvest and declined rapidly within <b>the</b> <b>next</b> a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> as logs become dehydrated. A logical recommendation for the forestry industry would be to apply fumigation treatments after 4 – 6 weeks post harvest to reduce the interference with insecticides. The respiration rate increased nearly 50 % for every 10 °C increase in temperature so the CO 2 issue is exacerbated during the warm summer months when a temperature-driven stimulation of respiratory processes will result in very high CO 2 concentrations in ship holds. Also, because respiratory processes are strongly dependent on moisture availability, any actions that can be taken to accelerate moisture loss will mitigate the CO 2 issue.|$|R

In 1915, Venizelos stated {{in an interview with}} a British journalist: [...] "Whatever happens within <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> critical <b>weeks,</b> let England never forget that Greece is with her, heart and soul, remembering her past acts of friendship in times of no less difficulty, and looking forward to abiding union in days to come." [...] Venizelos's willingness to defy the King and to have Greece fight on the Allied state was due in part to his Anglophilia as he genuinely believed that Britain had much to teach the Greeks, leading him to help found the Anglo-Hellenic Educational Foundation in 1918 {{while at the same time}} believing an alliance with the British Empire would allow the Greeks to finally achieve the Megali Idea (the [...] "Great Idea" [...] i.e. bringing the Greeks of Anatolia living under Ottoman rule into the Kingdom of Greece).|$|R

Montagu spent <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> rubbing all three cards on his trousers to provide a used sheen to them. To provide a used look to the uniform, it was worn by Cholmondeley, who was about the same build.

Ambassadors of France and Spain urged Bernis to insist that the election of the future pope be made to depend on his written engagement to suppress the Jesuits. Bernis refused, answering that demanding from the future pope a written or oral promise to destroy the Society of Jesus would be in violation of the canon law. In spite of this refusal, during <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> Bernis consecutively rejected all candidates proposed by Zelanti as too devoted to the Jesuits.

In his first career start against the Kansas City Chiefs, Junkin had six tackles, including the first one of the game in a 6–3 Browns win. A month later, Junkin injured his knee, and was forced to miss several games. He returned to the team in early November, but Johnson had played so well in Junkin's absence that he spent <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> as the backup inside linebacker.

40|$|Election {{campaigns are}} mostly argued {{on the basis}} of local issues that have direct impacts on our community; {{so much so that the}} phrase “all {{politics}} is local” is considered self-evident. However, some things are missed in our three-year electoral cycle. The biggest gap in our national conversation is the place of Australia in the world. Foreign policy takes a back seat during an election, and if it presents at all, it is as caricature: foreign wars, the nameless families who flee them, or massive defence procurements to meet undefined threats. The rest of the planet is meant to form a one-dimensional backdrop to our domestic drama. Whether we like it or not, this is all going to change. Australia remains an island in geographical name only. In terms of culture, economics, security, and even the weather patterns that threaten our homes or ruin our crops, our lives are bound up with people all over the world who are also trying to build safe and prosperous lives for themselves and their families. The Greens understand that UN Security Council Reform, or torture in West Papua, or the bitter, endless siege of Gaza, are subjects unlikely to make it onto talkback radio or into the election coverage over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> fevered <b>weeks.</b> Tragedies like the Syrian civil war seem incomprehensible from this distance. They probably seemed incomprehensible to people watching from Calais or Lesbos as well, until suddenly there were tent cities, and families piled up against barbed wire fences, and children washed up on beaches. Here in Australia, the razor wire contains those fleeing the disintegration of Afghanistan or the unspeakable aftermath of the Sri Lankan civil war, but their stories have much in common. How we respond to those seeking safe harbour from collapse will ultimately bear directly on our own survival...|$|R
40|$|Duration data {{appear in}} a {{diversity}} of situations in economics, but I will often refer to unemployment duration to provide a focus for {{the presentation of the}} material. Suppose we select a random sample of N persons entering unemployment and wait until they find jobs. Then we record the number of weeks each person has been unemployed: t 1,t 2, [...] .,tN. We have observations on the duration of a spell of unemployment for each of the individuals in the sample. In practice we {{are more likely to have}} censored duration data. That is, for some individuals we do not observe ti, possibly because they have not found a job at the time of the interview, so that all we know is that ti> t for some particular t, or they have found a job between selection and interview and all we know is that ti lies within a certain interval t< ti < t. There are enormous variations in the duration of spells of unemployment from one individual to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> (from a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> to five years or more) and it is important to model the causes for these differences. In particular it is important to know how the re-employment probability changes over the period of the spell and what is the impact of the level of unemployment benefits on these probabilities. More generally, duration data measure how long individuals remain in a certain state. Other examples include: job turnover, marital instability, time to transactions in stock markets, or duration...|$|R
