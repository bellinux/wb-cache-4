5000|$|The method {{utilizes}} equipment typically {{employed in}} seismic refraction surveys. This equipment {{consists of a}} seismograph, geophones placed in an array, and a seismic source. An array consists of 6 to 48+ geophones placed at some interval along the ground surface to measure the propagating waves and are connected to a seismograph that records the data. Rayleigh waves are generated from seismic sources described to be active, passive, {{or a combination of}} both. For example, active sources can be generated sources from a sledge hammer striking a plate or other sources that are created near the traverse. Passive sources can be nearby highway traffic, construction equipment working in the distance, etc. Several recordings (typically 15 to 60+ seconds long) are captured and stored for later analysis. As multiple traverses are performed along the ground surface, the 1-D profiles can be compiled to generate a 2-D profile of the subsurface conditions. It is worth noting that since seismic traverses typically [...] "average" [...] conditions along the <b>traverse</b> <b>length</b> to some extent, the expectations and limitations of geophysical methods should be realized.|$|E
40|$|A new {{instrument}} {{bridging the gap}} between atomic force microscopes (AFMs) and stylus profiling instruments is described. The constant force profiler is capable of subnanometer resolution over a 15 -mum vertical range with a horizontal <b>traverse</b> <b>length</b> of 50 mm. This long <b>traverse</b> <b>length,</b> coupled with the possibilities of utilizing standard radius, diamond measurement styli, make the force profiler more compatible with existing profiling instrument standards. The forces between the specimen and a diamond stylus tipped cantilever spring are sensed as displacements using a capacitance bridge. This displacement signal is then fed through a proportional plus integral controller to a high stability piezoelectric actuator to maintain a constant tip-to-sample force of approximately 100 nN. Much of the sensor head and traverse mechanism is made of Zerodur glass-ceramic to provide the thermal stability needed for long travel measurements. Profiles of a 30 -nm silica step height standard and an 8. 5 -mum step etched on Zerodur are presented...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{high-speed}} traversing mechanism {{using two}} electro-rheological clutches is described. An {{application of the}} traversing mechanism is in winding textile filaments onto spinning or weaving bobbins. The design specifications are a traverse speed of 5 m/s; a turn round period of 10 – 20 ms and a <b>traverse</b> <b>length</b> of 250 mm. The turn round position must be controllable and repeatable within 1 mm and the <b>traverse</b> <b>length</b> requires to be periodically varied in order to shape {{the ends of the}} resulting bobbin. These combined criteria of high speed and controllability makes the use of electro-rheological fluids an attractive proposition. The paper considers the effects of the main geometric and fluid parameters on the performance of the mechanism and uses this to outline the limiting performance of the mechanism, together with the effects on the precision of the mechanism. The paper also outlines control aspects of the mechanism and uses this to indicate important areas for consideration in the future development of electro-rheological fluids.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{research}} work we evaluated {{the effect of}} heat input and PWHT on dissimilar metal joints influencing their mechanical properties and microstructure. Dissimilar metal joints of Mild steel and EN 8 are prepared by using MIG welding process. This melting is possible because a sufficient amount of energy transferred per unit time and energy density is supplied to the wire. Tensile strength, impact, hardness was tested and Microstructure was studied. The heat input transferred along the transverse length of the welded joint will affect the entire weldment zone. Across the <b>traverse</b> <b>length</b> the hardness values are used to identify different zones of the welded joint. This heat input is varied with input parameters such as voltage, current and speed of wire. In the present research work heat input is considered as low and high heat input cases. The microstructure and the mechanical properties at different zones of each plate of weldment with low and high heat input cases are analysed with out and with post weld heat treatment...|$|E

The length of time in the process of milling machining is influenced by selection and design of machining parameters including cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut. The purpose of this study to know the influence of cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut as independent variables versus operation time at CNC milling process as dependent variables. Each independent variable consists of three level of factors; low, medium and high. Time machining process is measured from operation time simulation program, feed cut length and rapid <b>traverse</b> <b>length.</b> The results of statistically from software simulation MasterCam X Milling, then do the comparison to CNC Milling machine.   The data from experiments was statistically analyzed by ANOVA and Regression methods by software Minitab 16. Results show that the greater feed rate and depth of cut shorten the operation time of machinery, whereas cutting speed is not a significant influence. The depth of cut has the highest contribution to the value of 49. 56 %, followed by feed rate 43 % and cutting speed 0. 92 %. Optimal time of machining process total is 71. 92 minutes, with machining parameter on the condition cutting speed is 75360 mm/minutes, the feed rate is 800 mm/minutes and depth of cut = 1 mm.
