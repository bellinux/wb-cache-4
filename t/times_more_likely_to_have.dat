5|$|For {{persistent}} {{low back}} pain, the short-term outcome is also positive, with {{improvement in the}} first six weeks but very little improvement after that. At one year, those with chronic low back pain usually continue to have moderate pain and disability. People at higher risk of long-term disability include those with poor coping skills or with fear of activity (2.5 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> poor outcomes at one year), those with a poor ability to cope with pain, functional impairments, poor general health, or a significant psychiatric or psychological component to the pain (Waddell's signs).|$|E

The increased overrepresentation from arrest to imprisonment appears largely {{a function of}} the very high levels of recidivism found among Aborigines: 88 percent of male Aborigines are rearrested compared with 52 percent of non-Aborigines, and 75 percent of Aborigines return to prison at least once compared with 43 percent of non-Aboriginal males. States with a high Aboriginal 'cultural strength' and socioeconomic 'stress' index are the most punitive. 'Cultural strength,' 'stress,' and imprisonment are highly correlated and associated with those states with the most 'frontier' characteristics. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|Neurological {{diseases}} {{are common in}} inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, but their exact prevalence is unknown. Method We prospectively evaluated the presence of neurological disorders in 121 patients with IBD [51 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 70 with ulcerative colitis (UC) ] and 50 controls (gastritis and dyspepsia) over 3 years. Results Our standard neurological evaluation (that included electrodiagnostic testing) revealed that CD patients were 7. 4 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> develop large-fiber neuropathy than controls (p = 0. 045), 7. 1 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> develop any type of neuromuscular condition (p = 0. 001) and 5. 1 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> develop autonomic complaints (p = 0. 027).

25|$|Many {{more studies}} {{illustrate}} the problem. One meta-study {{was conducted by}} the psychiatry department of Oxford University at Warneford Hospital in the United Kingdom. Twenty surveys were analyzed, providing results for 6,743 adult refugees from seven countries. In the larger studies, 9% were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and 5% with major depression, with evidence of much psychiatric co-morbidity. Five surveys of 260 refugee children from three countries yielded a prevalence of 11% for post-traumatic stress disorder. According to this study, refugees resettled in Western countries could be about ten <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> PTSD than age-matched general populations in those countries. Worldwide, {{tens of thousands of}} refugees and former refugees resettled in Western countries probably have post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the relationship between exposure to television news messages about cervical cancer and women's vulnerability perceptions and fear. Methods: Five-hundred women aged 18 - 85 years were randomly recruited to participate in a survey-interview. A standardized questionnaire assessed risk perception, fear of cervical cancer, exposure to cervical cancer messages in television news and a number of potential confounders such as demographics and trait anxiety. Results: Results from multinomial regression analyses showed that women who had been occasionally exposed to cervical cancer messages were two <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be very afraid of getting cervical cancer. Women who had been frequently exposed were three <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be very afraid and three <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be extremely afraid. Women who had been regularly exposure to cervical cancer messages were also three <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> perceive a moderate risk and seven <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> perceive a large risk of being diagnosed with cervical cancer. Conclusion: These results suggest that television news may be an effective means for health education. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|William Parker, Randy Bollinger, {{and colleagues}} at Duke University {{proposed}} in 2007 that the appendix serves as a haven for useful bacteria when illness flushes those bacteria {{from the rest of}} the intestines. This proposal is based on an understanding that emerged by the early 2000s of how the immune system supports the growth of beneficial intestinal bacteria, in combination with many well-known features of the appendix, including its architecture, its location just below the normal one-way flow of food and germs in the large intestine, and its association with copious amounts of immune tissue. Research performed at Winthrop–University Hospital showed that individuals without an appendix were four <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a recurrence of Clostridium difficile colitis. The appendix, therefore, may act as a safe house for good bacteria. This reservoir of bacteria could then serve to repopulate the gut flora in the digestive system following a bout of dysentery or cholera, or boost it following a milder gastrointestinal illness.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, the {{discovery}} of a third planet (47 UMa d) was made by using the Bayesian Kepler Periodogram.

This discovery was announced by Debra Fischer and P.C. Gregory. This [...] planet has an orbital period of 14,002 days or 38.33 years and a semi-major axis of 11.6 AU with a moderate eccentricity of 0.16. It would be the longest-period planet discovered by the radial velocity method, although longer-period planets had previously been discovered by direct imaging and pulsar timing.|$|E
