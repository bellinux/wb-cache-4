On 18 April, the regiment, less the 6th Squadron, were part of a brigade force that advanced on the village of Shunet Nimrin. The operation was a deception to convince the Turks that further raids on Amman were imminent. The next day patrols from the regiment located a large Turkish force in the foothills around the village. The brigade positioned as if to attack them, <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> reinforced their position, the brigade withdrew. That night they crossed back over the river and camped outside Jericho. The regiment moved again on 23 April, to camp in the foothills to the south of Jericho.|$|E
5|$|Peregrine falcon {{recovery}} teams breed {{the species}} in captivity. The chicks are usually fed through a chute {{or with a}} hand puppet mimicking a peregrine's head, so they cannot see to imprint on the human trainers. <b>Then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are old enough, the rearing box is opened, allowing the bird to train its wings. As the fledgling gets stronger, feeding is reduced, forcing the bird to learn to hunt. This procedure is called hacking back to the wild. To release a captive-bred falcon, the bird is placed in a special cage {{at the top of}} a tower or cliff ledge for some days or so, allowing it to acclimate itself to its future environment.|$|E

Austin however {{remained}} in San Francisco where he had built up a career in real estate. The value of Bell's property had skyrocketed in the previous years and he proceeded to make improvements to the land.

Suffering from mental illness in his later years, William Bell died September 8, 1887 at the age of 70. He left to Austin a quarter his estate valued at $400,000, which continued to increase in value. Bell soon became one of Seattle's wealthiest citizens.|$|E

Mihailović and Ostojić realised that the large concentrations of Chetnik troops in and around Mostar and the nearby bauxite mines were likely to draw German attention, and while they were focused on this issue, the Partisans forced a crossing of the Neretva.|$|E
500|$|As {{the studio}} {{sessions}} progressed, the band members' new intimate relationships that formed after various separations started {{to have a}} negative effect on Fleetwood Mac. The musicians did not meet or socialise after their daily work at the Record Plant. At the time, the hippie movement still affected Sausalito's culture and drugs were readily available. Open-ended budgets enabled the band and the engineers to become self-indulgent; sleepless nights and the extensive use of cocaine marked much of the album's production. Chris Stone, one of the Record Plant's owners, indicated in 1997 that Fleetwood Mac brought [...] "excess at its most excessive" [...] by taking over the studio for long and extremely expensive sessions; he stated, [...] "The band would come in at 7atnight, have a big feast, party till1or2 in the morning, and <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were so whacked-out they couldn't do anything, they'd start recording".|$|E

2500|$|Partly {{because the}} group lived {{for three months}} in {{northeast}} Brazil, the band's first album shows clear influences of Brazilian music, mixed with symphonic rock and jazz. But the band's first live concert to support the album created {{one of the strangest}} anecdotes in Argentine rock: the fans did not understand the strange costumes the band used (entirely in white except for Garcia with a black jacket and shoes); and <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> played the song [...] "Disco Shock", a satire poking fun at disco music (which was at its height in 1978), people thought they were really serious. Whistles and boos would follow and {{what should have been a}} great concert turned into a fiasco, with fans clamoring for Sui Generis songs. People failed to get the message and Serú Girán did not get their point across too well either.

2500|$|Fleetwood Mac convened at the Record Plant February 1976 with hired {{engineers}} Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut. Most {{band members}} {{complained about the}} studio and wanted to record at their homes, but Fleetwood did not allow any moves. Despite his talent at keeping the group together, the recording of Rumours was fraught with emotional turmoil due to the collapsing relationships within the line-up. Christine McVie and Nicks decided to live in two condominiums near the city's harbour, while the male contingent stayed at the studio's lodge in the adjacent hills. Chris Stone, one of the Record Plant's owners, when the band jammed, recalled that [...] "The band would come in at 7atnight, have a big feast, party till1or2 in the morning, and <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were so whacked-out they couldn't do anything, they'd start recording". Fleetwood often played his drum kit outside the studio's partition screen to better gauge Caillat's and Dashut's reactions to the music's groove.

2500|$|For {{commercial}} harvesting, collectors {{use either}} basking traps or hoop traps. The basking trap is a floating enclosures with sloping sides and a basking surface. Turtles {{are able to}} climb up the sloping sides onto the basking surface, but <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> jump off into the center, they can't get back out. Hoop traps are cylindrical mesh traps with a funnel opening. Hoop traps are submerged and turtles are attracted by bait. In Minnesota, trappers say that they prefer basking traps to target painted turtles and hoop traps for [...] "meat" [...] turtles (snapping turtles and softshell turtles). Minnesota harvest records also show a clear pattern of most painted turtles coming from basking traps and most softshell and snapping turtles from hoop traps. Three quantitative studies of basking traps also show they are more efficient than baited hoop traps for trapping painted turtles. Despite the many hours of night and cloudiness when the basking traps do not lure turtles, the painted turtle's drive to bask is so powerful, that on a per-day basis, these traps are twice as effective. Or, possibly, the basking traps are more effective since painted turtles frequently escape back out the funnel of hoop traps.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1940s Mona began {{traveling}} with Milt on {{tours of the}} Cab Calloway Orchestra, where Milt was a bassist from 1936 through the early 1950s. Mona was the only musician’s friend or spouse to travel with the band. She was a trusted confidant who was known for her discretion, and she quickly became a valuable resource for the musicians. [...] When the band was crossing the country doing a series of one-nighters, Mona was instrumental in arranging lodging and food for the musicians. [...] She would often go to the African-American section of town and find several women {{who were willing to}} cook for the band. [...] She would pay for the food, organize the cooks, and have the food packed and delivered to the performance venue in time for intermission. [...] Since this was the height of the Jim Crow era, and since many of the towns were too small to have hotels that allowed African-Americans, Mona would frequently make arrangements for band members to sleep in local homes. She also helped musicians in the band manage their money, often insisting that they open savings accounts. [...] As she put it, “I was like the den mother. I used to save their money — those who would drink and couldn’t handle it, I’d take their money away from them at night, and <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> got sober the next morning I’d return it to them.” ...|$|E

[...] For a while we said nothing about it, but finally it began to be just a little too much to stand. [...] One day one of the Indians came to me just before it was time to enter the arena. [...] His horse was saddled and bridled, but he was leading the horse by the bridle. [...] I asked him what was the matter, and {{he said it was a}} wild horse and he was not going to ride it into the arena.

[...] <b>Then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> have the horse nicely broken, you give to a cowboy. [...] Why don’t you give the wild horses to the cowboys to break in? [...] They ride on saddles, and it would not be so hard for them.’ [...] But the chief cowboy only said, “Well, I can’t be bothered by a little thing like that. [...] You will have to see Buffalo Bill about the horses.’ [...] But I retorted, “You know very well that Buffalo Bill does not know what you do with the horses. [...] He does not know that you give the wild ones to the Indian boys to ride until they are broken in. [...] Give that horse back to that Indian boy or he will not go into the arena today.’ [...] That was all, but the boy got his horse in time to enter the arena with the others. [...] Just as I was ready to go back to the Indians, I looked at Buffalo Bill, and he had a twinkle in his eye. [...] After that, we had no more trouble with the horses.
