5|$|A bill providing, {{directly}} or indirectly, for the borrowing of money, the giving of any guarantee or {{the raising of}} any loan by the Government if, {{in the opinion of}} the President, the bill is likely to draw on reserves of the Government that <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>did</b> not accumulate in its current term of office.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} these changes had little practical effect, possibly due to opposition by the planners and confusion or fear among cadres. From 1981–84 agricultural production grew substantially, but <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> not use {{this opportunity to}} increase production of such crucial farm inputs as fertilizer, pesticide and fuel, nor of consumer goods. By the end of Lê Duẩn's rule, in 1985–1986, inflation had reached over 100% annually, complicating economic policy-making.|$|E

5|$|Lyon {{thought he}} could teach Yagan British ways and convert him to Christianity. He hoped to gain his {{cooperation}} and use his tribal stature to persuade the Noongar to accept colonial authority. Lyon spent many hours with Yagan learning his language and customs. After a month, Yagan and his companions escaped by stealing an unattended dinghy and rowing to Woodman Point on the mainland. <b>The</b> <b>Government</b> <b>did</b> not pursue them; apparently its officials considered they had been sufficiently punished.|$|E
5|$|The Government {{amended the}} bill to delay debate for six months. As expected, the bill then fell when the Dáil was {{dissolved}} in the intervening period for the 2007 general election. Deputy Howlin said that {{the real reason for}} the delay was that <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>did</b> not want to enact this type of social legislation {{in the face of an}} election.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{operated}} 24 McDonnell Douglas F-4E PhantomII fighter-bomber {{aircraft in}} the ground attack role between 1970 and 1973. The Phantoms were leased from the United States Air Force (USAF) as an interim measure owing to delays {{in the delivery of}} the RAAF's 24 General Dynamics F-111C bombers. The F-4Es were considered successful in this role, but <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> not agree to a proposal from the RAAF to retain the aircraft after the F-111s entered service in 1973.|$|E

Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins (520 F.3d 976) is a 2008 {{decision}} of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concerning civil forfeiture in admiralty law.

5|$|During the 1930s, a {{combination}} of developments, from the Great Depression to the vicious spiral of OUN terrorist attacks and government pacifications, caused government relations with the national minorities to deteriorate. Unrest among national minorities was also related to foreign policy. Troubles followed repressions in largely Ukrainian-populated eastern Galicia, where nearly 1,800 persons were arrested. Tension also arose {{between the government and}} Poland's German minority, particularly in Upper Silesia. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> not yield to calls for antisemitic measures; but the Jews (8.6% of Poland's population) grew discontented for economic reasons that were connected with the depression. Overall, by the end of Piłsudski's life, his government's relations with national minorities were increasingly problematic.|$|E

The Druze do not face official discrimination nor do they complain of social discrimination. Baha'is face both official and social discrimination. The Baha'i community does not have its own court to adjudicate personal status matters, such as inheritance and other family-related issues; such cases may be heard in Shari'a courts. Baha'i spouses face difficulty in obtaining residency permits for their non-Jordanian partners because <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>does</b> {{not recognize}} Baha'i marriage certificates. <b>The</b> <b>Government</b> <b>does</b> not officially recognize the Druze temple in Azraq, and four social halls belonging to the Druze are registered as [...] "societies."

5|$|In {{the second}} half of 1941 the Australian ICorps was {{concentrated}} in Syria and Lebanon where it undertook garrison duties while its strength was rebuilt ahead of further operations in the Middle East. Following the outbreak of war in the Pacific most elements of the corps, including the 6thand 7thDivisions, returned to Australia in early 1942 to counter the perceived Japanese threat to Australia. The Australian Government agreed to requests from Britain and the United States to temporarily retain the 9thDivision in the Middle East in exchange for the deployment of additional US troops to Australia and Britain's support for a proposal to expand the RAAF to 73squadrons. <b>The</b> <b>Government</b> <b>did</b> not intend that the 9thDivision would {{play a major role in}} active fighting, and it was not sent any further reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|The {{deployment}} to East Timor {{highlighted the}} limits of the Australian Defence Force and the need for an Army Reserve that could effectively provide deployable capabilities and individuals to round-out to the Regular Army in times of heavy operational commitment. As such, in late 2000 <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> what many governments had toyed with since the formation of the citizen force almost a hundred years earlier: enacting legislation that enabled the call-up of Reservists to full-time service in circumstances that fell short of a full scale defence emergency, thereby allowing their deployment overseas, while also protecting their employment and providing remuneration to employers.|$|E
5|$|The initial coup was {{postponed}} to September 1, 1919. However, some PMO units began their actions (cutting telegraph wires, damaging railways, etc.) as scheduled previously– {{on the night}} of August 27 to 28. The Lithuanian intelligence intercepted and decoded the order to delay the coup. They had known before that Poles were plotting, but did not know who and when. The Lithuanian government was informed about the cut telegraph wires and intercepted order in the morning of August 28. However, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> not consider the threat real and did not take appropriate action.|$|E

The South African government agreed to Crocker's terms in principle on 8 March. Savimbi proposed a truce regarding the Benguela railway on 26 March, saying MPLA trains could pass through {{as long as}} an international inspection group monitored trains to prevent their use for counter-insurgency activity. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> not respond.

5|$|Winds {{from the}} cyclone reached 157km/h (98mph) in Myanmar, {{occurring}} {{in conjunction with}} heavy rainfall and a high storm surge. Despite the storm's ferocity, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> not report about the cyclone for ten days, as they usually under-report on landfalling storms. The cyclone caused heavy damage throughout Rakhine State, destroying or heavily damaging 4,035homes and leaving 25,000people homeless. There was widespread crop damage, resulting in food shortages, and damaged roads disrupted subsequent relief efforts. Damage in Myanmar totaled over K621million kyat ($99.2million USD), making it the worst storm in the country since 1968, and there were 236deaths, with an unofficial death toll as high as 1,000. Although damage was heaviest in Myanmar, the cyclone's effects also spread into neighboring Bangladesh, where strong winds knocked over trees and capsized two ships.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} August, all of Bonanza Creek {{had been}} claimed by miners. A {{prospector}} then advanced up {{into one of the}} creeks feeding into Bonanza, later to be named Eldorado Creek. He discovered new sources of gold there, which would prove to be even richer than those on Bonanza. Claims began to be sold between miners and speculators for considerable sums. Just before Christmas, word of the gold reached Circle City. Despite the winter, many prospectors immediately left for the Yukon by dog-sled, eager to reach the region before the best claims were taken. The outside world was still largely unaware of the news and although Canadian officials had managed {{to send a message to}} their superiors in Ottawa about the finds and influx of prospectors, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> not give it much attention. The winter prevented river traffic, and it was not until June 1897 that the first boats left the area, carrying the freshly mined gold and the full story of the discoveries.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, matches at heavily {{attended}} grounds {{were initially}} prohibited {{due to the}} fear of aerial bombing by the Luftwaffe. Scottish national league and cup competitions were suspended {{for the duration of}} the war, but regional league and cup competitions were established in their place. Attendance was initially restricted to 50 percent of capacity; therefore, when 75,000 attended a wartime cup final in May 1940, it was the maximum permitted. The Parashots, a forerunner of the Home Guard, set up a command post at Lesser Hampden in 1940. A government official presented an order demanding that both the Hampden and Lesser Hampden pitches be ploughed and used to plant vegetables, but the Queen's Park committee chose to ignore the order and <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> not pursue it. Wartime internationals were played at Hampden, and 91,000 saw Scotland beat England 5–4 on 18 April 1942.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{suggested}} that Congress should charter the National Bank with a capitalization of $10million, one-fifth {{of which would}} be handled by the Government. Since <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>did</b> not have the money, it would borrow the money from the bank itself, and repay the loan in ten even annual installments. The rest was to be available to individual investors. The bank was to be governed by a twenty-five member board of directors that was to represent a large majority of the private shareholders, which Hamilton considered essential for his being under a private direction. Hamilton's bank model had many similarities to that of the Bank of England, except Hamilton wanted to exclude the Government from being involved in public debt, but provide a large, firm, and elastic money supply for the functioning of normal businesses and usual economic development, among other differences. For tax revenue to ignite the bank, it was the same as he had previously proposed; increases on imported spirits: rum, liquor, and whiskey.|$|E
