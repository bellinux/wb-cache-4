5|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>props</b> in The Wrath of Khan {{had been}} reused from The Motion Picture, or scrounged from other productions, but for The Search for Spock Winter wanted to design uniquely Star Trek items. George and artist Phil Norwood collaborated {{on many of}} the prop designs, {{creating}} updated and sleeker versions of the original television series communicators and phasers. Many props were created out of wood and embellished with small pieces from model kits. While the Federation tricorder was created using a model race car body, the Klingon props were intended to look dirtier, with sharp surfaces that looked uncomfortable to carry. George was insistent on using the shapes and materials, rather than blinking lights, to suggest <b>the</b> <b>props</b> were real and manufactured.|$|E
5|$|As {{the tunnels}} were constructed, they were {{generally}} supported by wooden beams and posts. Once the mine had been finished, the internal space {{was filled with}} combustibles, such as brushwood, firewood, resin, and other incendiary substances; once ignited, these would burn the supporting props, causing the mine to collapse, bringing down with it the structures lying above. From the 15th century, gunpowder was also used, although the aim remained to burn <b>the</b> <b>props.</b>|$|E
5|$|Each {{show is a}} {{synthesis}} of circus styles from around the world, with its own central theme and storyline. Shows employ continuous live music, with performers rather than stagehands changing <b>the</b> <b>props.</b> After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s, Nouvelle Expérience was created – with the direction of Franco Dragone – which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990, but allowed it to create new shows.|$|E
50|$|The Lightning's cockpit pod {{accommodates}} a {{pilot and}} passenger in tandem. The main rotor is two-bladed, with a pre-rotator. Like most autogyro aircraft, {{there is a}} rear empennage, supported by a boom; but whereas the usual approach (as on the Calidus) {{is to have the}} boom routed below <b>the</b> <b>prop,</b> thereby protecting <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> from ground strikes, this autogyro has a fully faired boom co-axial with <b>the</b> <b>prop.</b> <b>The</b> boom may be unbolted and removed to aid access to <b>the</b> engine and <b>prop.</b>|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{interesting}} area of <b>the</b> club, <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> room consists of a cavernous basement much larger than <b>the</b> club itself. <b>Props</b> from all of Disney animation can be found here, including magical items such as Genie's lamp and the Black Cauldron. <b>The</b> <b>prop</b> room is so large that one could get lost for days unless one took Pluto along as a guide. However, Mickey and his friends usually have little trouble navigating in <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> room.|$|R
30|$|Decreasing {{proppant}} size improves proppant {{transport and}} increases <b>the</b> <b>propped</b> fracture length. A 40 / 70 mesh proppant has <b>the</b> largest <b>propped</b> fracture length, while a 12 / 20 mesh size proppant has <b>the</b> least <b>propped</b> fracture length.|$|R
5|$|In December 2015, Black and Gass {{auctioned}} off props and costumes {{in support of}} the Sweet Stuff Foundation in response to the November 2015 Paris attacks where an Eagles of Death Metal concert was attacked. Tenacious D's 2014 Festival Supreme concert featured Eagles of Death Metal as an act on the main stage. <b>The</b> <b>props</b> auctioned include costumes worn on MTV's Total Request Live in 2003, JR Reed's The Metal from The Pick of Destiny tour, the costumes from the Low Hangin' Fruit music video.|$|E
5|$|Ward hired {{several of}} his {{recently}} graduated CalArts friends {{to work on the}} short with him. Neil Graf was tasked with coloring, Julian Narino was the background designer, and Adam Muto drew <b>the</b> <b>props.</b> Graf and Narino later got jobs with other series and studios—King of the Hill and Laika studio, respectively—but Muto continued working with Ward and eventually became Adventure Times co-executive producer and showrunner. The finished short ran for seven minutes, and production wrapped up in the spring of 2006.|$|E
5|$|Buso Renkins {{original}} work {{was created by}} Nobuhiro Watsuki {{in the form of}} a manga. The anime series was produced by Xebec and directed by Takao Kato. The series was planned by Kazuhiko Torishima, Akihiro Kawamura, Koji Kumozu, and Yukinao Shijimoji. The producers were Makota Oyoshi, Nobuhiro Nakayama, Shinichi Ikeda, Hinoyuki Yonemasu and executive producers were Naoko Watanabe and Kohei Kawase. Nobuyoshi Habara directed the opening and ending themes and its animation was directed by Akio Takami. Keito Watanabe directed the art of the series, Natsuyo Ban coordinated the colors, Takuya Matsumura designed the animation for the weapons, and Sunao Chikako designed <b>the</b> <b>props.</b> The sound was directed by Takeshi Takadara; sound effects were done by Mitsuru Kageyama, mixed by Naotsugu Uchida, edited by Akane Sango, and recorded at Half H-P Studio.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, the {{original}} MEV filming model, minus the cockpit canopy, {{was acquired by}} <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> restoration company <b>The</b> <b>Prop</b> Gallery, which commissioned the still-trading Master Models to refurbish the miniature that it had built 46 years previously.|$|R
50|$|LeVar Burton, {{who played}} the {{character}} of Geordi La Forge, disliked <b>the</b> VISOR <b>prop</b> because it restricted his peripheral vision - albeit less than its prototypes - and the constant pressure of <b>the</b> <b>prop's</b> arms on his temples caused headaches. In commentary for Star Trek Generations, film writers Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga noted Burton also felt <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> limited him as an actor, as it denied him {{the use of his}} eyes in conveying emotion. <b>The</b> original <b>prop</b> was inspired by a one-piece women's hair clip brought to production by Michael Okuda during the initial conceptual development of <b>the</b> VISOR <b>prop.</b>|$|R
5000|$|To counter [...] "prop walk", dagger like fins and rudders {{are placed}} in {{strategic}} locations to counter the tendency of <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> to paddle wheel the boat sideways. <b>The</b> faster a <b>prop</b> turns <b>the</b> greater <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> walk, and this effect along with torque roll with single motor setups has to be carefully dialed out.|$|R
5|$|Dick Rubin {{handled the}} film's props, {{and set up}} a {{makeshift}} office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have something in their hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of <b>the</b> <b>props</b> were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless earpiece, which Nichols specifically requested {{on the first day of}} shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had forgotten about). The new phaser was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four blinking lights. The prop came with a hefty $4000 price tag; to save money, the lights were dropped, reducing the size of the phaser by a third. A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, with the provision that it look far different from the watch Dick Tracy had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of <b>the</b> <b>props</b> were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future man-made materials would be used almost exclusively.|$|E
5|$|Lucas, who had {{previously}} confronted problems with <b>the</b> <b>props</b> used to depict R2-D2, allowed ILM and the production's British special effects department {{to create their own}} versions of the robot. Nine R2-D2 models were created; one was for actor Kenny Baker to be dropped into, seven were built by ILM and featured two wheelchair motors capable of moving , enabling it to run and be mostly used in stage sets, and the British studio produced a pneumatic R2-D2 that could shift from two to three legs and was mostly used in Tunisia because its motor drive system allowed it to drive over sand.|$|E
5|$|On March 14, 2014, Gaga {{revealed}} {{during her}} keynote speech with John Norris at SXSW {{that she would}} release the video a week later. She also tweeted a still from the clip with a caption about the release date. A preview of the clip aired on March 21, during an interview with Savannah Guthrie for Today. The video debuted in full on Dateline NBC a day later. To coincide {{with the release of}} the video, The Out NYC hotel changed their name temporarily to The G.U.Y. Hotel and would keep it till April 10, 2014. Located in Midtown New York, the hotel also opened a Gaga Gallery which started from March 28 (Gaga's birthday) and show cased <b>the</b> <b>props</b> and dresses included in the music video.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>prop</b> fry {{used in the}} {{campaign}} was about four inches (10 cm) long and molded from polyurethane plastic. <b>The</b> <b>prop</b> was eventually purchased by the GoldenPalace.com online casino for $75,100 in an online auction intended {{to raise money for}} the Ronald McDonald House Charities.|$|R
50|$|To {{maximise}} {{and create}} the effect thin, flexible, white props are used, although variations on size and colour offer a different effect. White <b>props</b> allow <b>the</b> greatest reflection of projected light, and when <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> repeatedly intercepts <b>the</b> light beam at high speed the flexibility and thinness of <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> give <b>the</b> illusion that a whole image can be seen (if <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> were to stop you'd only see {{a section of the}} image). Ropes, bungee chords, staffs, pvc conduit and the edges of handheld fans have been used publicly, although a number of props have been used in theatre laboratory. Ideally the flexibility will become more apparent when <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> is manipulated for example: the curve of a rope when it is spun.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} underlying methods for providing {{the driving force}} to operate <b>the</b> <b>prop.</b> As with many classic illusions there are numerous copies and imitations of <b>the</b> original <b>props</b> on <b>the</b> market. Well-engineered <b>props</b> are particularly important with this illusion for safety reasons. Because of the assistant's posture during {{the main part of}} the performance there is a risk of injury if <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> does not function correctly, a risk which can be substantial in the case of cheaply made props.|$|R
5|$|Artisans {{from across}} India were {{recruited}} to craft <b>the</b> <b>props.</b> The costumes {{were designed by}} Makhanlal and Company, and Delhi-based tailors skilled in zardozi embroidery stitched the Mughal costume. The footwear was ordered from Agra, the jewellery was made by goldsmiths in Hyderabad, the crowns were designed in Kolhapur, and blacksmiths from Rajasthan manufactured the armoury (which included shields, swords, spears, daggers, and armour). The zardozi on costumes were also stitched by designers from Surat. A statue of Lord Krishna, to which Jodhabai prayed, was made of gold. In the scenes involving an imprisoned Anarkali, real chains were placed on Madhubala. The battle sequence between Akbar and Salim reportedly featured 2,000 camels, 400 horses, and 8,000 troops, mainly from the Indian Army's Jaipur cavalry, 56th Regiment. Dilip Kumar has spoken of the intense heat during filming of the sequence in the desert of Rajasthan, wearing full armour.|$|E
5|$|Costume {{designer}} Christine Peters crafted the episode's baseball uniforms {{after visiting}} Sports Robe, a Hollywood costume house. Dena Green from the hair department gave extras haircuts {{so that they}} would be {{in the style of the}} 1940s. Car coordinator Kelly Padovich rented two 1947 model Flxible buses for the Roswell Greys on-bus scenes, as well as various other 1930s- and 1940s-era cars. Researcher Lee Smith worked with the Baseball Hall of Fame to ensure the accuracy of the statistics used in the episode. <b>The</b> <b>props</b> department developed from scratch the Peter Rosebud Bank that Dales shows Mulder; it was one of the most expensive props of the season. The score by Mark Snow, the show's composer, was recorded with musicians rather than synthesizers for the first time in the series' history; slide guitar player Nick Kirgo and harmonica performer Tommy Morgan assisted Snow with the music.|$|E
5|$|More than 1,000 {{shots of}} Wolverine have visual effects in them, which {{required}} three effects supervisors and seventeen different companies {{to work on}} the film. The most prominent was Hydraulx, who had also worked in the X-Men trilogy and was responsible for the battle in Three Mile Island and Gambit's powers. Many elements were totally generated through computer-generated imagery, such as the adamantium injection machine, the scene with Gambit's plane and Wolverine tearing through a door with his newly enhanced claws. CG bone claws were also created for some scenes because <b>the</b> <b>props</b> did not look good in close-ups. Extensive usage of matte paintings was also made, with Matte World Digital creating five different mattes for the final scene of the film—a pullback depicting the destroyed Three Mile Island—and Gavin Hood handing company Hatch Productions pictures of favelas as reference for the Africa scenes.|$|E
40|$|In {{longwall}} working face, it {{is essential}} to maintain roof strata in good condition, which is closely connected to safety and productivity of the face. Since the condition of the roof strata is greatly influenced by the resistance of <b>the</b> face <b>props,</b> it is important for strata control to use proper types of <b>props</b> in <b>the</b> proper way. From this point of view, underground investigations in order to confirm the resistance displayed by <b>the</b> face <b>props</b> were carried out. The resistance of a steel prop was obtained by measuring the strain of <b>the</b> <b>prop,</b> for which a couple of strain gauges were cemented onto <b>the</b> <b>prop.</b> This method of measuring <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> load proved to be pertinent in order to obtain the magnitude of the load acting on friction props and Dowty hydraulic props...|$|R

5|$|The {{success of}} the Broadway {{production}} {{has led to the}} development of an auxiliary show, Behind the Emerald Curtain, created by Sean McCourt – an original Broadway production cast member who played the Witch's Father, among other roles, in addition to understudying the Wizard and Doctor Dillamond, before taking over the latter principal role – and Anthony Galde who was a long-running swing in the Broadway company from 2004 to 2012. The tour features a ninety-minute behind-the-scenes look at <b>the</b> <b>props,</b> masks, costumes and sets used in the show, and includes a question-and-answer session with the cast members. The Broadway tour is currently led by McCourt and long-running ensemble member and Glinda understudy Lindsay K. Northen. The tour also featured in the Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago sit-down productions, and were each run by different long-serving cast members of the show. The tour provides a behind the scenes look at what goes into putting on the show every day. Participants get a first hand account of what it is like to be a part of the massive production that Wicked is.|$|E
5|$|Greg Jein, {{best known}} as the builder of the alien {{mothership}} from Close Encounters of the Third Kind, was called on to build props for the film. Jein was a longtime Star Trek fan who had constructed <b>the</b> <b>props</b> for The Final Frontier, but was forced to remake props that had since mysteriously disappeared. Jein added references to the original television series and other science fiction franchises throughout the prop designs; the Rura Penthe warden's staff contained parts of a spaceship from Buck Rogers, while the frong was detailed with a prop from Buckaroo Banzai. Elements from The Final Frontier were modified and reused; a medical implement from the film became Chekov's blood tester, and the assault phasers first seen in The Final Frontier became standard issue. Gorkon's staff was intended to be a massive bone from an alien creature he had killed, with the designs shaped out of green foam and approved by Meyer. Two copies were strong enough to support David Warner's weight; another two were designed to be light enough to be hung from wires for the zero gravity scenes. Since the Klingon phasers were redesigned for the third film, the original holsters no longer fit the weaponry; as a result, no Klingons had ever been seen drawing a phaser. Meyer was adamant about having the actors be able to unholster their weapons, so the existing pistols had to be redesigned. The Klingon sniper rifle was broken into sections, with parts modeled from real weapons.|$|E

5000|$|A {{significant}} portion of wakeboarding boats utilizes V-drive propulsion. These boats have a regular inboard engine, but are turned 180° such that the transmission {{is in front of}} the engine, rather than behind, or [...] "inline", which is a more common layout for inboard tournament ski boats. <b>The</b> <b>prop</b> shaft exits <b>the</b> transmission towards the rear of the boat, so that <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> is placed directly under the engine. When viewed from the side, such a layout appears as a [...] "V" [...] lying on its side. This layout allows for better weight distribution(with the engine farther aft), and places <b>the</b> <b>prop</b> farther forward, reducing the danger of <b>the</b> spinning <b>prop</b> near <b>the</b> stern of the vessel, where riders enter and exit the water.|$|R

In addition to a miniature, two full-size props were built. After the end of the series, the full-scale exterior model was donated to a school for the blind. It then passed through a series of owners before being sold at auction in 2012. It was then restored and donated to the Johnson Space Center.|$|E
