The warship was named after <b>Thomas</b> <b>S.</b> Gates, Secretary of Defense {{in the last years of}} the Eisenhower Administration (1959-1961). <b>Thomas</b> <b>S.</b> Gates was laid down 31 August 1984 at Bath Iron Works, Maine and {{sponsored}} by Anne Gates, widow of the ships namesake. <b>Thomas</b> <b>S.</b> Gates was launched 14 December 1985, purchased 22 June 1987 and was commissioned 22 August 1987 in Philadelphia, PA with Captain Robert Sutton in command.
