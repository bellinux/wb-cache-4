5|$|After {{affecting}} Taiwan and China, Rammasun began weakening due to {{an approaching}} trough, which <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> typhoon northeastward. It passed over the Japanese island of Miyako-jima and also produced strong winds in Okinawa. About 10,000houses lost power on the island, and high surf killed two sailors. On the Japanese mainland, there was light crop damage and one serious injury. After weakening to a tropical storm, Rammasun passed {{just west of the}} South Korean island of Cheju-do, killing one person from high waves. The storm crossed the country, killing three others and leaving $9.5million in damage. High rains also affected North Korea and Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an outline of}} the changes in linguistics that gave rise to historical pragmatics in the 1990 s and that have shaped its development over the twenty years of its existence. These changes have affected virtually all aspects of linguistic analyses: the nature of the data, the research questions, the methods and tools that are being used for the analysis, as well as the nature of the generalizations and findings that result from these investigations. We deal with the changes in terms of shifts in thought styles and discuss seven different turns: <b>the</b> pragmatic <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> socio-cultural <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> dispersive <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> empirical <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> digital <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> discursive <b>turn</b> and <b>the</b> diachronic <b>turn.</b> We also deal with some long-standing, recent or emerging interfaces where historical pragmatics interacts with other disciplines and we discuss some future challenges, such as the multimodality and fluidity of communication and the problem of combining big data with pragmatic micro analyses...|$|R

5|$|After {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}} again, Gretelle slowed in the Mozambique Channel. A cold front bypassed the storm to the south, and a building ridge behind it turned Gretelle to a west-northwest drift. Although it approached southeastern Africa on January28, an advancing trough <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> storm to the southeast. The next day, the JTWC briefly re-upgraded Gretelle to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane, and on January30, the MFO estimated a secondary 10minute wind peak of 85km/h (50mph). Accelerating to the south-southeast, Gretelle dissipated on January31 well to the south-southwest of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|After being decommissioned, Coalhouse Fort was leased {{and used}} as a storage {{facility}} by Bata Shoes, which operated the nearby Bata shoe factory in East Tilbury.
