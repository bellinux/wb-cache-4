5|$|The total {{populations of}} the bohor reedbuck are {{estimated}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>above</b> 100,000. Though the populations are decreasing, it is not sufficiently low to meet the Near Threatened criterion. Thus, the IUCN rates the bohor reedbuck as of Least Concern. Around three-fourth of the populations survive in protected areas. Populations of the reedbuck are either declining or uncertain in Boucle du Baoulé National Park (Mali); Comoé National Park (Ivory Coast); Mole and Digya National Parks (Ghana). Numbers in the Akagera National Park, where its last-known populations in Rwanda exist, have seen a steep fall.|$|E
5|$|This jay {{is treated}} as a species of Least Concern, or not {{threatened}} with extinction, by BirdLife International due to its large geographical range of about , population which, while unsurveyed, is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>above</b> 10,000 individuals, and lack of a 30% population decline over the last ten years. However, the azure-hooded jay is uncommon {{in some parts of}} its range. It is also believed that deforestation may have an effect on this bird.|$|E

5|$|On December7, 2001, Gray's team {{issued its}} first extended-range {{forecast}} for the 2002 season, predicting above-average activity (13named storms, 8hurricanes, and about 2 of Category3 or higher). It listed an 86percent chance {{of at least}} one major hurricane striking the U.S. mainland. This included a 58percent chance {{of at least one}} major hurricane strike on the East Coast, including the Florida peninsula, and a 43percent chance of at least one such strike on the Gulf Coast from the Florida Panhandle westward. The potential for major hurricane activity in the Caribbean was forecast <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>above</b> average.|$|E

The potential for major hurricane activity in the Caribbean was forecast <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>above</b> average, and the team predicted that El Niño, associated with reduced hurricane activity in the Atlantic, would dissipate by the active portion of the season.|$|E

5|$|The bohor reedbuck inhabits moist grasslands and swamplands {{as well as}} woodlands. The bohor reedbuck is {{native to}} Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania and Togo. The animal is {{possibly}} extinct in Ivory Coast and Uganda. Reckless hunting and loss of habitat {{as a result of}} human settlement have led to significant decline in the numbers of the bohor reedbuck, although this antelope tends to survive longer in such over-exploited areas as compared to its relatives. The total populations of the bohor reedbuck are estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>above</b> 100,000. Larger populations occur in eastern and central Africa than in western Africa. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) rates the bohor reedbuck as of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{smoke and}} {{airborne}} particulates from the fires posed {{a threat to}} local communities on several occasions. Smoke and particulates were especially high in Gardiner, Montana. There, monitoring stations maintained by the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences and the park recorded 19 days where recommended allowable particulate concentrations were exceeded. This was also the case near fires, and on 7 occasions at Mammoth, Montana, {{the location of the}} park headquarters. In no other surrounding communities were particulates found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>above</b> acceptable levels. Smoke and haze made driving difficult and sometimes even dangerous. A number of fire fighters were treated at clinics for smoke and dust inhalation and a few for inadvertently inhaling fumes from a sulfur ignition near one of the geothermal areas.|$|E

Socially, the area includes both working class areas like Old Trafford and Stretford and middle class ones such as Bowdon and Hale. Altrincham and Sale West is one of the five parliamentary constituencies in Greater Manchester to be held by the Conservative Party, the others being Bury North, Hazel Grove, Cheadle and Bolton West.|$|E

50|$|Implementation of {{circular}} dependencies in C/C++ {{can be a}} bit tricky, {{because any}} class or structure definition must <b>be</b> placed <b>above</b> its usage in the same file.

5|$|After the 1903 {{destruction}} of the original wooden bridge at Belvidere, plans to construct another bridge started immediately. After the storm, the substructure of the crossing had survived the strong storm. The bridge corporation set a completion date, August 17, 1904, which was {{the day that the}} Farmer's Picnic was held in Belvidere. However, the contractor of which they hired to reconstruct the bridge, the New Jersey Bridge Company of Manasquan, New Jersey, believed that the new bridge would need new abutments and piers to be completed by that time, instead of using the old wooden bridge's piers. The three piers from the wooden bridge were used, and would require them to be heightened <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>above</b> any high flood waters. On June 3, 1904, the bridge construction began on a barge in the river, with promises to be complete by the set date of August 17. On August 17, the bridge was not complete, but usable, that when the Farmer's Picnic (the predecessor to the Warren County Fair, occurred, people were allowed to cross a majority of the bridge. The picnic itself was a complete success, attracting over 15,000 people, most of which walked the bridge.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} secure a {{position}} as a teacher, erudite in the capital, or government official, a student could choose one of several paths to become well educated. Perhaps the most prestigious path was enrollment in the Imperial University. Students had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>above</b> the age of eighteen to enroll, and were selected by the Minister of Ceremonies from those recommended by local authorities. Other students could choose to enroll in a school sponsored by the local commandery government. A professional teacher who opened a private school {{in a small town}} or village could sometimes gather a following of several hundred to over a thousand students. Students were expected to pay tuition, thus a teacher enjoyed a significant salary. His standing in the local community was usually paramount, and was even sought as an arbiter in disputes. Although the size of the Imperial Academy was greatly expanded in Eastern Han, private schools grew in importance as the imperial government lost authority and its academy's persecution of Old Text tradition drove many to pursue Old Text studies in private institutions.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the party}} {{continues}} {{and the party}} goers force Burns' monkeys into having a knife fight. The yacht is eventually boarded by Chinese pirates who take the ship hostage. The pirates rob everyone on board and tie them up in a net which they then toss overboard. But to the luck of Homer {{and some of the}} other guests who happen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>above</b> ocean surface level, it floats and they avoid drowning. Eventually Homer and Bart make it back to the mansion where the family returns the house to Burns after Marge and Lisa have scrubbed all the rooms clean. Back at the Simpsons home, everyone is glad to live a normal life again—with the exception of Homer, who is upset that he does not live the lifestyle of rich people. The episode ends with Homer wailing about how rich all the persons in the closing credits are (except Richard K. Chung, whom he dismisses as poor) and threatening to report them to the Internal Revenue Service and telling the Gracie Films woman not to shush him.|$|E

5|$|Multiple {{agencies}} predicted above-average activity, citing forecasts for slower-than-average trade winds, warmer-than-normal {{sea surface}} temperatures, abnormally low wind shear, and the unlikelihood of an El Niño developing {{prior to the}} peak of the season. On December5, 2012, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), a public consortium consisting of experts on insurance, risk management, and seasonal climate forecasting at University College London, issued an extended-range forecast. In its report, the organization called for 15.4 (±4.3) named storms, 7.7 (±2.9) hurricanes, 3.4 (±1.6) major hurricanes, and a cumulative Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index of 134. While no value was placed on the number of expected landfalls during the season, TSR stated that the landfalling ACE index was expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>above</b> average. Four months later, on April5, Tropical Storm Risk issued its updated forecast, continuing to call for an above-average season with 15.2 (±4.1) named storms, 7.5 (±2.8) hurricanes, 3.4 (±1.6) major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 131; the landfalling ACE index was once again forecast to be higher than normal.|$|E
