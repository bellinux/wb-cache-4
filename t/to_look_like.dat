5|$|It's like a 90's, throwback-type vibe, when I said 'I want it <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> this,' I said like a TLC, Fresh Prince type vibe. I was like, 'Let's {{just get}} really silly, 90's amazing outfits, {{and just go}} out and dance around and have fun.|$|E

5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In {{is modeled}} after a 1950s {{drive-in}} theater. The entrance is made <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a box office, and guests can walk from there along a tall fence {{to the dining}} room, where they sit at formica countertops in booths made <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> convertibles from the 1940s and 1950s. These booths were designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and are made of fiberglass with much chrome plating. The cars have whitewall tires, and speakers are mounted on poles next to each car. The license plates are dated from 1955, and each convertible seats four people, although these mock vehicles were initially six-seaters when the restaurant first opened. There are six picnic tables near {{the back of the}} room that are only used when the rest of the restaurant is full and there are guests who are willing to forego the experience of sitting in the cars. All guests who make reservations are seated in the cars, although this was not the case the year the restaurant first opened. The restaurant has a total seating capacity of 260.|$|E
