5|$|Some Australian {{politicians}} and defense commentators proposed that Australia {{should attempt to}} purchase F-22s instead of the planned F-35s, citing the F-22's known capabilities and F-35's delays and developmental uncertainties. However, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) determined that <b>the</b> <b>F-22</b> was unable to perform the F-35's strike and close air support roles. The Japanese government also showed interest in <b>the</b> <b>F-22</b> for its Replacement-Fighter program. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) would reportedly require fewer fighters for its mission if it obtained <b>the</b> <b>F-22,</b> thus reducing engineering and staffing costs. However, in 2009 {{it was reported that}} acquiring <b>the</b> <b>F-22</b> would require increases to the defense budget beyond the historical 1 percent of GDP. With the end of F-22 production, Japan chose the F-35 in December 2011. Israel also expressed interest, but eventually chose the F-35 because of the F-22's price and unavailability.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, <b>the</b> <b>F-22</b> was {{upgraded}} with {{a backup}} oxygen system, software upgrades and oxygen sensors {{to address the}} frequent oxygen deprivation issues and normalize operations. In 2013, the faulty flight vest valves were replaced and altitude restrictions lifted; distance restrictions will be lifted once a backup oxygen system is installed. In April 2014, the USAF stated in Congressional testimony that installation of automatic backup oxygen systems on <b>the</b> <b>F-22</b> fleet would be completed within twelve months.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>F-22</b> {{cannot be}} {{exported}} under American federal law {{to protect its}} stealth technology and other high-tech features. Customers for U.S. fighters are acquiring earlier designs such as the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon or the newer F-35 Lightning II, which contains technology from <b>the</b> <b>F-22</b> but {{was designed to be}} cheaper, more flexible, and available for export. In September 2006, Congress upheld the ban on foreign F-22 sales. Despite the ban, the 2010 defense authorization bill included provisions requiring the DoD to prepare a report on the costs and feasibility for an F-22 export variant, and another report on the effect of F-22 export sales on U.S. aerospace industry.|$|E
5|$|To reduce {{operating}} costs and lengthen <b>the</b> <b>F-22's</b> service life, some pilot training sorties are performed using flight simulators, while the T-38 Talon {{is used for}} adversary training. DoD budget cuts led to F-22 demonstration flights being halted in 2013 before resuming in 2014. In 2012, {{it was reported that}} <b>the</b> <b>F-22's</b> maintenance demands have increased as the fleet aged, the stealth coatings being particularly demanding.|$|R
50|$|In May 2006, a {{released}} report documented {{a problem}} with <b>the</b> <b>F-22's</b> forward titanium boom, caused by defective heat-treating. This made the boom on roughly <b>the</b> first 80 <b>F-22s</b> less ductile than specified and potentially shortened the part's life. Modifications and inspections were implemented to the booms to restore life expectancy.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{possibility}} of crashes of <b>the</b> <b>F-22s</b> stationed at <b>the</b> base, the city of Hampton is attempting to buy up privately owned property via eminent domain to create a safety buffer zone around the base.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>F-22</b> has {{integrated}} radio functionality, {{the signal}} processing systems are virtualized {{rather than as}} a separate hardware module. There have been several reports on the F-22's inability to communicate with other aircraft, and funding cuts have affected the integration of the Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL). Voice communication is possible, but not data transfer.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>F-22</b> was {{designed}} to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar. Measures to reduce radar cross-section include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges, fixed-geometry serpentine inlets that prevent line-of-sight of the engine faces from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return. <b>The</b> <b>F-22</b> was also designed to have decreased radio emissions, infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye. The aircraft's flat thrust-vectoring nozzle reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing ("heat seeking") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special paint and active cooling of leading edges to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.|$|E
5|$|The X-44 MANTA, or multi-axis, no-tail aircraft, was {{a planned}} {{experimental}} aircraft based on <b>the</b> <b>F-22</b> with enhanced thrust vectoring controls and no aerodynamic surface backup. The aircraft {{was to be}} solely controlled by thrust vectoring, without featuring any rudders, ailerons, or elevators. Funding for this program was halted in 2000.|$|E
50|$|Former President Michael M. Dunn {{has complained}} about both <b>the</b> {{termination}} of <b>F-22</b> production and <b>the</b> 250 legacy fighters the Air Force had to retire {{to pay for}} upgrading <b>the</b> reduced <b>F-22</b> fleet.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> Lockheed Martin <b>F-22</b> Raptor is a fifth-generation, single-seat, twin-engine, {{all-weather}} stealth tactical fighter aircraft {{developed for}} the United States Air Force (USAF). The result of the USAF's Advanced Tactical Fighter program, the aircraft was designed primarily as an air superiority fighter, but also has ground attack, electronic warfare, and signal intelligence capabilities. [...] The prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, built most of <b>the</b> <b>F-22's</b> airframe and weapons systems and conducted final assembly, while Boeing provided the wings, aft fuselage, avionics integration, and training systems.|$|R
50|$|The 71st {{was renamed}} the 71st Fighter Training Squadron and {{reactivated}} in August 2015, flying the Northrop T-38 Talon. Its {{mission is to}} conduct adversarial air training for <b>the</b> <b>F-22s</b> flown by <b>the</b> other squadrons of the 1st Fighter Wing. This training was previously performed by <b>F-22s</b> of <b>the</b> 27th Fighter Squadron at substantially more expense.|$|R
5|$|Naval F-22 variant – {{a planned}} carrier-borne variant of <b>the</b> <b>F-22</b> with variable-sweep wings for the U.S. Navy's Navy Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF) program {{to replace the}} F-14 Tomcat. Program was {{canceled}} in 1993. Former Secretary of the Air Force Donald Rice called {{the possibility of the}} naval variant the deciding factor for his choice of the YF-22 over the YF-23.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>F-22</b> {{is highly}} maneuverable at both {{supersonic}} and subsonic speeds. Computerized {{flight control system}} and full-authority digital engine control (FADEC) make the aircraft highly departure resistant and controllable. The Raptor's relaxed stability and powerful thrust-vectoring engines enable the aircraft to turn tightly and perform very high alpha (angle of attack) maneuvers such as the Herbst maneuver (J-turn) and Pugachev's Cobra. The aircraft is also capable of maintaining over 60° alpha while having some roll control.|$|E
5|$|The first F-22, an {{engineering}} and manufacturing development (EMD) aircraft named Raptor 4001, was unveiled at Marietta, Georgia, on 9 April 1997, and first flew on 7 September 1997. In 2006, the Raptor's development team, composed of over 1,000 contractors and the USAF, won the Collier Trophy, American aviation's most prestigious award. <b>The</b> <b>F-22</b> was in production for 15 years, {{at a rate}} of roughly two per month during peak production.|$|E

5|$|The FB-22 was a {{proposed}} medium-range bomber for the USAF. The FB-22 was projected {{to carry up}} to 30 Small Diameter Bombs to about twice {{the range of the}} F-22A, while maintaining <b>the</b> <b>F-22's</b> stealth and supersonic speed. However, the FB-22 in its planned form appears to have been canceled with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review and subsequent developments, in lieu of a larger subsonic bomber with a much greater range.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>F-22's</b> high {{cruise speed}} and {{altitude}} increase the effective ranges of its munitions, with the aircraft having 50% greater employment range for the AIM-120 AMRAAM than prior platforms. While specifics are classified, {{it is expected}} that JDAMs employed by F-22s will have twice or more the effective range of legacy platforms. In testing, an F-22 dropped a GBU-32 JDAM from 50,000 feet (15,000m) while cruising at Mach 1.5, striking a moving target [...] away.|$|R
5|$|Flight {{testing of}} <b>the</b> <b>F-22</b> began in 1997 with Raptor 4001, the first EMD jet, and eight more F-22s would {{participate}} in the EMD and flight test program. Raptor 4001 was retired from flight testing in 2000 and subsequently sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFB) for survivability testing, including live fire testing and battle damage repair training. EMD F-22s {{have been used for}} testing upgrades, and also as maintenance trainers. The first production F-22 was delivered to Nellis AFB, Nevada, in January 2003.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, the USAF {{opened the}} Raptor enhancement, {{development}} and integration (REDI) contract to bidders, with a $16 billion budget. In November 2011, Lockheed Martin's upgrade contract ceiling {{was raised to}} $7.4 billion. Nearly $2 billion was allocated for structural repairs and to achieve fleet availability rate of 70.6% by 2015. However, only 63% was achieved. Some F-35 technology, such as more durable stealth coatings, have been applied to <b>the</b> <b>F-22.</b> By 2012, the update schedule had slipped seven years due to instability in requirements and funding. In 2014 the USAF moved to cut upgrade funding.|$|E
5|$|New backup oxygen {{generators}} and filters have been {{installed on the}} aircraft. The coughing symptoms {{have been attributed to}} acceleration atelectasis ("collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange"), which may be exacerbated by the F-22's high performance. The presence of toxins and particles in some ground crew was deemed to be unrelated. On 4 April 2013, the distance and altitude flight restrictions were lifted after <b>the</b> <b>F-22</b> Combined Test Force and 412th Aerospace Medicine Squadron determined that breathing restrictions on the pilot were responsible as opposed to an issue with the oxygen provided.|$|E
500|$|The Raptor {{achieved}} Full Operational Capability (FOC) in December 2007, when General John Corley of Air Combat Command (ACC) officially declared <b>the</b> <b>F-22s</b> of <b>the</b> integrated {{active duty}} 1st Fighter Wing and Virginia Air National Guard 192d Fighter Wing fully operational. This {{was followed by}} an Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI) of the integrated wing in April 2008, {{in which it was}} rated [...] "excellent" [...] in all categories, with a simulated kill-ratio of 221–0.|$|R
50|$|The AN/APG-81 is a {{successor}} radar to <b>the</b> <b>F-22's</b> AN/APG-77. Over three thousand AN/APG-81 AESA radars {{are expected to}} be ordered for the F-35, with production to run beyond 2035, and including large quantities of international orders. As of October 2013, over one hundred APG-81s have already been produced and delivered. The first three blocks of radar software have been developed, flight tested, and delivered ahead of schedule by the Northrop Grumman Corporation.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>F-22</b> Raptor is a {{fifth-generation}} fighter that {{is considered}} fourth generation in stealth aircraft technology by the USAF. It is the first operational aircraft to combine supercruise, supermaneuverability, stealth, and sensor fusion in a single weapons platform. The Raptor has clipped delta wings with a reverse sweep on the rear, four empennage surfaces, and a retractable tricycle landing gear. Flight control surfaces include leading-edge flaps, flaperons, ailerons, rudders on the canted vertical stabilizers, and all-moving horizontal tails; these surfaces also serve as speed brakes.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>F-22</b> has a {{glass cockpit}} with all-digital flight instruments. The {{monochrome}} head-up display offers a wide {{field of view}} {{and serves as a}} primary flight instrument; information is also displayed upon six color liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels. The primary flight controls are a force-sensitive side-stick controller and a pair of throttles. The USAF initially wanted to implement direct voice input (DVI) controls, but this was judged to be too technically risky and was abandoned. The canopy's dimensions are approximately 140inches long, 45inches wide, and 27inches tall (355cm x 115cm x 69cm) and weighs 360 pounds.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics YF-22 was an American single-seat, {{twin-engine}} fighter aircraft {{technology demonstrator}} {{designed for the}} United States Air Force (USAF). The design was a finalist in the USAF's Advanced Tactical Fighter competition, and two prototypes were built for the demonstration/validation phase of the competition. The YF-22 won the contest against the Northrop YF-23, and entered production as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. The YF-22 has similar aerodynamic layout and configuration as <b>the</b> <b>F-22,</b> but with differences in the position and design of the cockpit, tail fins and wings, and in internal structural layout.|$|E

500|$|The aircraft's dual Pratt & Whitney F119-PW-100 {{afterburning}} turbofan {{engines are}} closely spaced and incorporate 2D pitch-axis thrust vectoring nozzles {{with a range}} of ±20 degrees; each engine has maximum thrust in the 35,000lbf (156kN) class. [...] <b>The</b> <b>F-22's</b> thrust-to-weight ratio in typical combat configuration is nearly at unity in maximum military power and 1.25 in full afterburner. [...] Maximum speed without external stores is estimated to be Mach 1.82 during supercruise and greater than Mach 2 with afterburners.|$|R

5|$|The two {{contractor}} teams submitted evaluation {{results with}} their proposals in December 1990, and on 23 April 1991, Secretary of the Air Force Donald Rice {{announced that the}} YF-22 was the winner. The Air Force selected the YF119 engine to power <b>the</b> <b>F-22</b> production version. The Lockheed and Pratt & Whitney designs were rated higher on technical aspects, were considered lower risks, and were considered to have more effective program management. It has been speculated in the aviation press that the YF-22 was also seen as more adaptable to the Navy's NATF, but by 1992 the U.S. Navy had abandoned NATF.|$|E
5|$|In December 2005, the USAF {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>F-22</b> had achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC). During Exercise Northern Edge in Alaska in June 2006, in simulated combat exercises 12 F-22s of the 94th FS downed 108 adversaries with no losses. In the exercises, the Raptor-led Blue Force amassed 241 kills against two losses in air-to-air combat, with neither loss being an F-22. During Red Flag 07-1 in February 2007, 14 F-22s of the 94th FS supported Blue Force strikes and undertook {{close air support}} sorties. Against superior numbers of Red Force Aggressor F-15s and F-16s, 6–8 F-22s maintained air dominance throughout. No sorties were missed because of maintenance or other failures; a single F-22 was judged lost against the defeated opposing force. F-22s also provided airborne electronic surveillance.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>F-22</b> {{is among}} {{only a few}} {{aircraft}} that can supercruise, or sustain supersonic flight without using fuel-inefficient afterburners; it can intercept targets which subsonic aircraft would lack the speed to pursue and an afterburner-dependent aircraft would lack the fuel to reach. The Raptor's high operating altitude is also a significant tactical advantage over prior fighters. The use of internal weapons bays permits the aircraft to maintain comparatively higher performance over most other combat-configured fighters {{due to a lack}} of aerodynamic drag from external stores. The F-22's structure contains a significant amount of high-strength materials to withstand stress and heat of sustained supersonic flight. Respectively, titanium alloys and composites comprise 39% and 24% of the aircraft's structural weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{high cost}} of the aircraft, a lack of clear air-to-air {{missions}} due to delays in Russian and Chinese fighter programs, a ban on exports, {{and development of the}} more versatile F-35 led to <b>the</b> end of <b>F-22</b> production. A final procurement tally of 187 operational production aircraft was established in 2009, and <b>the</b> last <b>F-22</b> was delivered to the USAF in 2012.|$|R
25|$|On 16 November 2010, a Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor {{took off}} for a {{training}} mission. At approximately 1900 hrs., the base reported that the aircraft was overdue and missing. Air Force rescue teams were reported to be concentrating their search for the missing plane and pilot in Denali National Park. <b>The</b> <b>F-22's</b> crash site was found about 100 miles north of Anchorage {{near the town of}} Cantwell, Alaska. The pilot, of the US Air Force's 525th Fighter Squadron, was killed in the crash.|$|R
