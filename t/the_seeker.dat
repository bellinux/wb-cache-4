5|$|In Star Wars: Jedi Arena, two Jedi Knights, one {{blue and}} one red, {{face each other}} during lightsaber training. Player one is blue; the red Jedi is either a human- or {{computer-controlled}} opponent. The player controls his or her lightsaber with the paddle controller, defending oneself from the laser blasts coming from <b>the</b> <b>Seeker</b> ball, fired by the opponent. <b>The</b> <b>Seeker</b> will regularly turn wild and fire laser blasts randomly. The objective {{of the game is}} to fire laser blasts from <b>the</b> <b>Seeker</b> at the opponent's shield and finally directly at the opponent by aiming in the direction that the lightsaber is pointing. The game has four difficulty levels, changing the Seeker's speed; on the highest level, <b>the</b> <b>Seeker</b> is invisible. The game ends when one player has received three direct hits, and the winner becomes a Jedi Master.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} {{when the story}} first emerged, but similar stories, {{possibly}} inspired by medieval Arthurian legends, exist at the nearby locations of Hexham and the Eildon Hills. Matthew Lewis wrote a poem, Sir Guy <b>the</b> <b>Seeker,</b> popularising the story in 1808, with subsequent versions produced by W. G. Thompson in 1821 and James Service in 1822. The tale continues to be told {{as part of the}} local oral tradition.|$|E
5|$|Star Wars: Jedi Arena is a 2D {{overhead}} shooter {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Parker Brothers in 1983 for the Atari 2600. It is the first Star Wars video game to feature lightsaber action. The goal of the game, based on one scene in the original Star Wars film, is {{to take out the}} opponent with <b>the</b> <b>Seeker</b> ball while defending oneself from incoming laser blasts using one's lightsaber.|$|E

5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle has closely {{associated}} with the legend of Sir Guy <b>the</b> <b>Seeker</b> since at least the early 19th century. Different versions of the story vary slightly in their details, but typically involve a knight, Sir Guy, arriving at Dunstanburgh Castle, where he was met by a wizard and led inside. There he comes across a noble lady imprisoned inside a crystal tomb and guarded by a sleeping army. The wizard offers Guy a choice of either a sword or a hunting horn to help free the lady; he incorrectly chooses the horn, which wakes the sleeping knights. Sir Guy finds himself outside Dunstanburgh Castle, and spends {{the rest of his life}} attempting to find a way back inside.|$|E
5|$|The Emperor's flagship, Grig Orig, destroys Zoah, but the Black Fleet {{intervenes}} before Edge and {{the dragon}} are killed. At the Tower, Craymen tells Edge {{it is one}} of several that manufacture monsters to combat humanity's destructive forces. He needs Azel to activate the Tower and destroy the Empire before they can use it for themselves. Imperials arrive and capture Edge and Craymen. After the Emperor forces Azel to activate the Tower, monsters emerge and kill Craymen, the Emperor, and their men. Edge and Azel escape on Edge's dragon. At <b>the</b> <b>Seeker</b> stronghold, Gash explains that the Tower will destroy humanity if it is not deactivated. He believes Edge's dragon is the prophesied Divine Visitor who will be humanity's salvation. Edge and the dragon battle rampaging monsters and destroy the infested Grig Orig.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{the cave}} network {{she finds a}} dying Cameo, who tells her the Beforetime weapons Alexi and Vega are searching for caused the Great White, {{but they do not}} know this. She also reveals it is Elspeth’s destiny, as <b>the</b> <b>Seeker,</b> to destroy them. After {{mourning}} her death, Elspeth overhears that Rushton, imprisoned in the next cavern, is the true heir of Obernewtyn. Suddenly, she is captured by Ariel, who ties her to a table next to the Zebkrahn machine. Elspeth is forced to hold the diaries of Marisa Seraphim, the wife of the founder of Obernewtyn and Alexi's stepmother, and use her abilities to discover what Marisa was thinking when she wrote them to determine the weapons’ location. Still withstanding the torture, Elspeth mentally enters Rushton’s mind and recognises the voice of her earlier rescuer from the Zebkrahn. Rushton gives his mental strength to her to endure the pain inflicted on her by the machine. In her despair at their threats to kill him, her resistance breaks and Marissa’s thoughts reveal the map to be carved into the front doors of Obernewtyn. At this point, the Zebkrahn overheats and bursts into flames. Something in Elspeth’s mind cracks and she uses this new power to kill Vega, who she saw standing over Rushton with a knife. She falls unconscious as Domick and Rushton’s other friends rush in. Alexi is killed, but Ariel flees into the night and is believed to have died in the blizzard. Now known to be the legal master of Obernewtyn, Rushton plans to build it into a secret refuge for Misfits.|$|E

25|$|Early {{infrared}} homing missiles had two {{limitations that}} made them difficult to use in combat situations. The first was that <b>the</b> <b>seeker</b> was relatively insensitive and required large, hot sources to reliably track a target. In practice, this meant the engine of the enemy aircraft had to remain visible to the missile though the shot. The other was that <b>the</b> <b>seeker</b> had a limited field of view (FOV), meaning it could only see the target if it {{was in front of}} the missile. This meant it was possible for the target to escape by flying at right angles to the missile, maximizing its angular velocity relative to <b>the</b> <b>seeker.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is also {{necessary}} for <b>the</b> <b>seeker</b> to have a correct creed (Aqidah), and to embrace with certainty its tenets. <b>The</b> <b>seeker</b> must also, of necessity, turn away from sins, love of this world, the love of company and renown, obedience to satanic impulse, and the promptings of the lower self. (The way in which this purification of the heart is achieved is outlined in certain books, but must be prescribed in detail by a Sufi master.) <b>The</b> <b>seeker</b> must also be trained to prevent the corruption of those good deeds which have accrued {{to his or her}} credit by overcoming the traps of ostentation, pride, arrogance, envy, and long hopes (meaning the hope for a long life allowing us to mend our ways later, rather than immediately, here and now).|$|E

25|$|Second {{generation}} infrared missiles, such {{as early}} {{versions of the}} U.S. Stinger, the Soviet SA-14, and the Chinese FN-6, use improved coolants to cool <b>the</b> <b>seeker</b> head, which enables <b>the</b> <b>seeker</b> to filter out most interfering background IR sources as well as permitting head-on and side engagement profiles. These missiles may also employ technologies to counter decoy flares that might be deployed by targeted aircraft and also have backup target detection modes such as the ultraviolet (UV) mode found on the Stinger missile.|$|E
25|$|The devotional {{practices}} of Sufis vary widely. This is because an acknowledged and authorized {{master of the}} Sufi path is in effect a physician of the heart, able to diagnose the seeker's impediments to knowledge and pure intention in serving God, and to prescribe to <b>the</b> <b>seeker</b> a course of treatment appropriate {{to his or her}} maladies. The consensus among Sufi scholars is that <b>the</b> <b>seeker</b> cannot self-diagnose, and that it can be extremely harmful to undertake any of these practices alone and without formal authorization.|$|E
25|$|The story follows {{six people}} on a routine flight {{of the space shuttle}} Odyssey, on August 7, 2007: four astronauts, a scientist, and a {{television}} news reporter. During the flight, the Earth rapidly dissolves into a fiery ball and implodes. Control of the Odyssey is momentarily lost, and one astronaut is killed. The remaining five crew members resign themselves to death, but an inorganic being called <b>the</b> <b>Seeker</b> rescues them. <b>The</b> <b>Seeker</b> tells them that fifty other worlds have been destroyed {{in the same way as}} Earth, and <b>the</b> <b>Seeker</b> has always arrived too late to observe it; this is the first time he has found survivors. He offers to send them five years into the past (to 2002, the year the series aired), so that they can prevent the disaster. He sends only their consciousnesses back, because physical time travel is impossible. The mission commander learns a codeword associated with the disaster: Leviathan.|$|E

Will travels through time to track down the signs that will enable him to confront the evil forces. The Dark is personified by The Rider (Eccleston). This film adaptation drew strong negative reaction from fans of the book series for its disregard of the source material.|$|E
