5|$|Influenced by {{concerns}} about overpopulation, the counterculture of the 1960s and the societal effects of television, the play depicts {{a world of}} the future where a small elite control the media, keeping the lower classes docile by serving them an endless diet of lowest common denominator programmes and pornography. The play concentrates on an idea the programme controllers have for a new programme which will follow the <b>trials</b> <b>and</b> <b>tribulations</b> {{of a group of}} people left to fend for themselves on a remote island. In this respect, the play is often cited as having anticipated the craze for reality television.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi {{as the last}} game in an Ace Attorney trilogy; he also {{wanted it to be}} the final entry in the series, as he felt he had explored Phoenix's character fully. Because he was satisfied with the gameplay in Justice for All, he did not introduce any new gameplay mechanics in <b>Trials</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tribulations.</b> Flashbacks were used as a major theme in the game; this originated in Takumi {{trying to come up with}} a way of handling dialogue-integrated tutorials, and deciding to use a flashback to a case from when Mia was a rookie attorney.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro, with character designs by Tatsuro Iwamoto, and music by Noriyuki Iwadare and Yasuko Yamada. Eshiro got the idea {{to make a new}} game featuring characters from the original Ace Attorney games while working on <b>Trials</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tribulations.</b> According to Eshiro, the game was made for portable play, and has an interface that uses the touch screen; as this could not be replicated on other platforms such as Xbox Live, he said that the Nintendo DS was the platform that was best suited for it, and that no ports to other hardware were planned.|$|E
5|$|<b>Trials</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tribulations</b> has {{received}} generally favorable reviews for the Nintendo DS, holding {{a score of}} 81/100 based on 45 reviews at the review aggregator Metacritic; meanwhile, the Wii version holds a Metacritic score of 67/100 based on 9 reviews, indicating mixed or average reviews. The North American Nintendo DS release was a success, with pre-orders more than double of Capcom's estimates, resulting in a shortage of it at both retailers and at Capcom's own online store. In 2010, IGN ranked the game as the 23rd best video game for the Nintendo DS, praising it for its writing and for being an evolution of the point-and-click adventure genre.|$|E

5|$|Several {{films have}} been remade or {{influenced}} by Tiga Dara. A remake, Tiga Dara Mencari Cinta (Three Maidens Seek Love), {{was directed by}} Djun Saptohadi and released in 1980. This comedy starred Ingrid Fernandez, Nana Riwayatie, and Winny Aditya Dewi as three sisters who live with their father and face the <b>trials</b> <b>and</b> <b>tribulations</b> of dating. Eight years later, when Teguh Karya was directing Pacar Ketinggalan Kereta (Lover Left by the Train, 1989), he insisted that {{the cast and crew}} watch Tiga Dara in an attempt to transcend it. In Tempo, the writer Putu Wijaya later described Pacar Ketinggalan Kereta as seemingly trying to recapture the family and musical dynamics of Ismail's story. In 2004 a remake of Tiga Dara, to be directed by Rudi Soedjarwo and involve Dian Sastrowardoyo, Siti Nurhaliza, and Krisdayanti, was announced, though this production has not been realized.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} {{by a team of}} 28 staff members, including producer Minae Matsukawa, director Mitsuru Endo, and character designer Kazuya Nuri. Series creator Shu Takumi, who wrote the game's scenario and took on a supervisory role for the production, had wanted the series to end with <b>Trials</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tribulations,</b> as he felt that Phoenix's character had been explored fully; when it was decided that the game would get made, he wanted it to have a new main character with a new story, and wanted Phoenix to not make an appearance. Despite this, it was decided that Phoenix would be the accused in the first case in the game. Apollo Justice sold around 250,000 copies during the first retail week and 515,417 by the end of 2007, and has been mostly positively received by critics.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Jake tries to fulfill a bizarre lifelong {{ambition}} of being a brick inside a shack as it collapses. Finn, being supportive, leaves a walkie talkie with Jake, who absentmindedly begins to narrate the events around him. Finn and BMO are drawn into Jake's storytelling, and Finn uses Starchy's radio station to broadcast Jake's narration of the <b>trials</b> <b>and</b> <b>tribulations</b> of a rabbit. All of Ooo is soon engrossed in the radio broadcast, unbeknownst to Jake.|$|E

Throughout their <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>tribulations,</b> they must learn to cope with an insatiable record label executive, incompatible producers and ultimately with each other.|$|R
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro. Eshiro {{had come up with}} the idea of a new adventure game about Ace Attorney characters while working on <b>Trials</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tribulations,</b> and Yamazaki had the idea to have it be about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. The game was specifically designed to be different from previous Ace Attorney titles, with a larger focus on the environment. The development team had originally considered using Ema Skye, a character from earlier games in the series, as the lead character, but used Miles Edgeworth instead because of his popularity. They aimed to have players be immersed in the game and feel like they are Edgeworth, as opposed to previous Ace Attorney games, where they felt players merely could identify with the lead characters; to do this, they included direct control of Edgeworth, and a gameplay element that involves connecting his thoughts.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} game's {{development}} was finished, Mikami told Takumi {{that they should}} make an Ace Attorney trilogy, with a grand finale in the third game's last case. Takumi had originally planned to let Edgeworth be the prosecutor in all episodes in the second game, but during the production the development team learned that the character had become popular. This led to Takumi feeling {{that he had to}} use the character more carefully and sparingly; he created the new prosecutor character Franziska von Karma, to save Edgeworth for the game's last case, and avoid a situation where he – a supposed prodigy – loses every case. As Takumi wanted the three first Ace Attorney games to be parts of a larger work, he avoided making a lot of changes between games: art from the first game for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth was reused, to avoid having the previous games look outdated in comparison to newer games in the series; and no new gameplay mechanics were added for <b>Trials</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tribulations,</b> as Takumi was happy with the gameplay after having added the psyche-lock mechanic for Justice for All.|$|E

50|$|As {{the title}} {{name of the}} series suggests, the story {{highlights}} the typical Indian dilemmas regarding matrimony. The story revolves around the life of Jayant Malik and Sharda Malik who are having major difficulties finding the best matches for their four unmarried daughters. The strange thing is that although Mrs. Malik is a matchmaker and has arranged countless matches, she is unable {{to find the best}} suited boys for her own daughters.

5000|$|... "Theuerdank" [...] is {{the name}} of the main protagonist in the work. The name may be {{translated}} as [...] "noble or knightly thought".Drawing on Arthurian romances, it tells the fictionalised story, in romanticised verse, of Maximilian (as Theuerdank) travelling to the Duchy of Burgundy in 1477 to marry his bride-to-be, Mary of Burgundy, and the subsequent eight years of his life as ruler of the Duchy. In the story, Theuerdank is a young prince who, after many <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>tribulations,</b> succeeds in rescuing princess Ehrenreich but who must go on crusade before being permitted to marry her.|$|R

25|$|The History of the Republic of China begins {{after the}} Qing dynasty in 1912, when the {{formation}} of the Republic of China as a constitutional republic put an end to 4,000 years of Imperial rule. The Qing dynasty, (also known as the Manchu dynasty), ruled from 1644–1912. The Republic had experienced many <b>trials</b> <b>and</b> <b>tribulations</b> after its founding which included being dominated by elements as disparate as warlord generals and foreign powers.|$|E
25|$|From {{the innocence}} of childhood, to the flush of {{youthful}} overconfidence, through the <b>trials</b> <b>and</b> <b>tribulations</b> of middle age, to the hero's triumphant salvation, The Voyage of Life seems intrinsically linked to the Christian doctrine of death and resurrection. Cole's intrepid voyager also may {{be read as a}} personification of America, itself at an adolescent stage of development. The artist may have been issuing a dire warning to those caught up in the feverish quest for Manifest Destiny: that unbridled westward expansion and industrialization would have tragic consequences for both man and nature.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, with Ol' Dirty Bastard {{again in}} jail for crack cocaine possession, his record label Elektra Records made the {{decision}} to release a greatest hits album (despite there being only two albums in his back catalog) in order to both end their contract with the artist (see below section), in order to help him profit from the publicity generated by his legal troubles.

50|$|Cotton, through <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>tribulation,</b> {{becomes the}} leader of this tight-knit group, and he sets out to mold his {{followers}} into a unit that commands respect rather than derision. Of course it’s a formidable task in view of the fragile psychological state of the small group, which includes two warring dysfunctional brothers who are known as “Lally 1” and “Lally 2.” Lally 1 reacts to threats against his emotional security by throwing violent temper tantrums, often directed as his younger brother Lally 2, who {{in the face of these}} attacks plunges himself into a fantasy world that is filled with tiny creatures he calls Ooms, and seeks solace in the scorched foam rubber pillow he always carries.|$|R
5000|$|For much of Zenk's run on As the World Turns, her character, Barbara, was {{tormented by}} her {{criminal}} ex-husband, James Stenbeck (played by Anthony Herrera). For {{a brief period}} in the mid-1980s, the character of Barbara was taken {{in a different direction}} by head-writer, Douglas Marland, and became a romantic vixen. But for the most part, Barbara was a beleaguered heroine who faced one <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>tribulation</b> after another. [...] In 2001, then head-writer Hogan Sheffer took the character in a drastically different direction after the character suffered burns in a fire which destroyed her face (and more deception by then-husband Craig Montgomery). As a result, the character descended into hell and she became the show's villainess.|$|R
