5|$|Paleontology {{seeks to}} map out how living <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> through time. A {{substantial}} hurdle to this aim is the difficulty of working out how old fossils are. Beds that preserve fossils typically lack the radioactive elements needed for radiometric dating. This technique is our only means of giving rocks greater than about 50 million years old an absolute age, and can be accurate to within 0.5% or better. Although radiometric dating requires very careful laboratory work, its basic principle is simple: the rates at which various radioactive elements decay are known, and so {{the ratio of the}} radioactive element to the element into which it decays shows how long ago the radioactive element was incorporated into the rock. Radioactive elements are common only in rocks with a volcanic origin, and so the only fossil-bearing rocks that can be dated radiometrically are a few volcanic ash layers.|$|E

The player then rolls dice equal to their skill plus the {{relevant}} attribute modified by applicable modifiers. The number of fives and sixes {{is equal to the}} number of hits. Hits above the threshold indicate extraordinary performance. Furthermore, if more than half the dice rolled are ones, then the player has made a glitch. Glitches cause bad things to happen to the player and game masters are encouraged to be inventive and funny.|$|E

25|$|Discussions about Fahrenheit 451 often {{center on}} its story {{foremost}} {{as a warning}} against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, {{he was concerned about}} censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E

He {{said in an interview that}} the film's script is not particularly intense, but has a light narration. The film's basic theme, established by Kumar and his assistant directors, was [...] "that <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> and our sorrows and joys have been exchanged; Night and day, morning and evening, a movement of souls united in being, cosmic beings rearranged. Some things may go wrong in one’s life but they are corrected in the other life. The universe and nature correct the mistakes made in one life, in the other." [...] He said that this statement would seem complex but would be fully explained by the film.|$|E

He was joined on the grid's front row by Jeff Gordon. Matt Kenseth qualified third, Ragan took fourth, and Paul Menard started fifth. Kahne, Tony Stewart, Kyle Busch, Johnson and Joey Logano rounded out the top ten qualifiers. The five drivers who failed to qualify were Joe Nemechek, Scott Speed, Jeremy Mayfield, Todd Bodine and Scott Riggs. After the qualifier Reutimann said, [...] "We had a great car all day, right off the truck. This pole reminds me of how much <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> for me in the past few years.

[...] Seeing [...] "his melancholy, his sitting alone, staring at the ground", he [...] "fell in love" [...] with him. Cox and his family later drove to a beach; [...] "Winter Vacation" [...] relates to Cox’s memory of the beach, being [...] "infected with that new love" [...] found after meeting Pundt.

[...] In the song, Cox asks Pundt, [...] "Are you going to come with me, or are you staying here?" [...] In [...] "Ativan" [...] Cox examines his addiction to the drug of the same name, as well as his relationship with Pundt. [...] "It talks a lot about how <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> between me and Lockett's relationship and how he's met a girl and…our friendship is never gonna change, but it's difficult sometimes."

500|$|The Cosby Show {{is famous}} for rarely {{discussing}} political or controversial topics; it spends significantly more time openly addressing Clair's role as [...] "a woman who 'has it all'", maintaining a successful career while raising a family, than it does the race of its characters. The series seldom shies away from discussing gender equality. Despite never referring to herself as feminist within the show, Clair proudly embodies several feminist themes and beliefs, remaining, according to The Daily Dots Nico Lang, [...] "an outspoken advocate for equality in her household, fighting sexism while setting an example for her daughters." [...] From the sitcom's earliest stages, Cosby had always intended for Clair to reflect the ever-changing work and family dynamic, explaining, [...] "If this was 1964 ... my wife could do the cooking and I could be {{the guy on the}} sofa who just says, ‘Let your mother handle this.’ But today a lot of <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> and I want the show to reflect those changes." [...] According to Rotten Tomatoes' Alex Vo, Clair represents [...] "the rapidly changing gender and household roles from the 1980s and onward." [...] MeTV agreed that Clair is [...] "the '80s response to the '50s housewife." [...] Although feminism was hardly a new concept to sitcoms by the time The Cosby Show premiered, feminist television characters remained scare during the early 1980s. The Huffington Posts Dr. Mlsee Harris observed that, during this time, [...] "The stereotypical role of the black woman on television ... had been that of a financially struggling, single woman with dysfunctional relationships, trying to get her life together with no distinct direction", stereotypes Clair worked to defy. Sarah Galo of Mic observed that Clair demonstrates that motherhood and having a career are not [...] "separate entities".|$|E

The climate of the city in A.D. 2019 is very different from today's. It is strongly implied that industrial pollution has adversely affected planet Earth's environment, i.e. global warming and global dimming. Real animals are rare in the Blade Runner world. In Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, animal extinction and human depopulation of the planet were consequent to the radioactive fallout of a nuclear war; Owls were the first species to become extinct.

She notes, in line with classical Marxist theory, that constitutionalism in general fits with the capitalist mode of production and bourgeoise democracy, and does not fit in with China's socialist system of people's democratic dictatorship. Constitutional government has a market economy in which private property plays the predominant role, as the basis unlike the Chinese socialist market economy in which public ownership is the basis.

He later refers to Jack (Barrowman) and Martha as [...] "the girlie and the freak", adding to the insult by claiming he is not sure which is which.
