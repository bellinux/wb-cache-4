5|$|In 1924, {{residents}} of nearby settlements urged {{construction of the}} railway line to the proposed bridge site, but they were <b>told</b> <b>this</b> extension of the line was to be delayed.

5|$|Congress {{approved}} {{the extension of}} I-70; however, the route still had {{to be approved by}} the representatives of the U.S. military on the planning committee. Military representatives were concerned that plans for this new highway network did not have a direct connection from the central U.S. to southern California; and further felt Salt Lake City was adequately connected. Military planners {{approved the}} extension, but moved the western terminus south to Cove Fort, using I-70 as part of a link between Denver with Los Angeles instead of Salt Lake City. Utah officials objected to the modification, complaining they were being asked to build a long and expensive freeway that would serve no populated areas of the state. After being <b>told</b> <b>this</b> was the only way the military would approve the extension, Utah officials agreed to build the freeway along the approved route.|$|E
5|$|Later on {{the evening}} of 7 August, she asked Bamber whether he had done it. He said no, but that a friend of his had, whom he named; the man was a plumber the family had used in the past. Bamber {{allegedly}} said he had <b>told</b> <b>this</b> friend how he could enter and leave the farmhouse undetected, and that one of his instructions had been for the friend to telephone him from the farm on one of the phones in the house that had a memory redial facility, so that if the police checked it, it would give him an alibi. Everything had gone as planned, he said, except that Nevill had put up a fight, and the friend had become angry and shot him seven times. The friend had allegedly told Sheila to lie down and shoot herself last, Bamber said. The friend then placed the Bible on her chest so she appeared to have killed herself in a religious frenzy. The children were shot in their sleep, he said. Mugford said Bamber claimed to have paid the friend £2,000.|$|E

25|$|Geoffrey Chaucer wrote a Canterbury {{tale about}} a young lady, Constance, who alone survives a {{massacre}} only {{to be put into}} an open boat and set adrift upon the sea. Chaucer <b>told</b> <b>this</b> story as the Man of Law's Tale in the late-14th century, and his tale of the setting-adrift of Constance in an open boat derives from an earlier, Latin version. The Middle English Breton lai Emaré also incorporates this element in its plot. Just like Constance, and just like Christabel in this tale of Sir Eglamour of Artois, Emaré narrowly survives death and is put instead into a boat which takes her to a distant land and a new life.|$|E
25|$|On 2 October Hindenburg {{told the}} Kaiser’s Crown Council that Germany {{could no longer}} win a {{military}} victory, and the following day a new government was formed under Prince Max, which approached President Wilson for peace based on the Fourteen Points.

At the meeting Haig again asked for US divisions for his sector, and was <b>told</b> <b>this</b> was not going to happen.|$|E

25|$|Two {{weeks before}} he was killed, Bermúdez Zacarías {{reached out to the}} Metepec {{municipal}} police for help and told them that he suspected that someone was following him. He also <b>told</b> <b>this</b> to Manuel Delgadillo Aguiñaga, one of his coworkers. After the murder, his coworker told investigators that Bermúdez Zacarías saw two suspicious men on a motorcycle one day in his neighborhood when he was coming back home from work. Bermúdez Zacarías decided to turn around in his car and drive away. Minutes later, he arrived home escorted by a Metepec police car. Despite fearing for his life, Bermúdez Zacarías did not officially ask for any sort of security measures or protection, and continued his daily activities as usual. According to his family, Bermúdez Zacarías never told them about this incident or that he faced any work-related death threats.|$|E
25|$|In {{desperate need}} of money, Anger wrote a book titled Hollywood Babylon in which he {{collected}} together gossip regarding celebrities, some of which he claims he had been <b>told.</b> <b>This</b> included claiming (with no corroboration or citing of sources) that Rudolph Valentino liked to play a sexually submissive role to dominant women, that Walt Disney was a drug user, addicted to opiates (reflected {{in the character of}} Goofy, who's perpetually stoned on cannabis), as well as describing the nature of the deaths of Peg Entwistle and Lupe Vélez. The work was not published in the United States initially, and it was first released by the French publisher Jean Jacques Pauvert. A pirated (and incomplete) version was first published in the U.S. in 1965, with the official American version not being published until 1974. Now with some financial backing from the publication of Hollywood Babylon, his next film project was The Story of O; essentially a piece of erotica featuring a heterosexual couple engaged in sadomasochistic sexual activities, although it refrained from showing any explicit sexual images.|$|E
25|$|In April 1205 the Bishop of Hereford {{was summoned}} {{to appear before the}} court for his refusal to admit a {{suitable}} priest to this church currently in the possession of Cecilia Devereux. In his defense he stated that the clergy of the Hereford Chapter refused to allow an appointment as they claimed possession of this chapel. They requested the right to present their case. On 6 June 1205 Hugh, Dean of Hereford, paid 2 marks for convening another court to hear his suit countering the recognition of Cecilia’s holding of the chapel at Putley. On 29 June 1206, the Bishop of Hereford and his attorney appeared before the court claiming the church of Putley as their right, and that the grant to Cecilia Devereux had only occurred because the hearing proceeded too quickly to allow them to present their case. When the canons were informed of Cecilia’s claim, they had requested that the sheriff of Hereford put her claim on hold and were <b>told</b> <b>this</b> would require a warrant of the king. The canons submitted an assize presenting their position, and paid 12 shillings for the court to be summoned. On 15 October 1206 the Canons of Hereford appeared to show by what right the claim of Cecilia to the chapel of Putley should be set aside. They argued that they had been in possession of the chapel for over 60 years, and presented the original charter granting them the chapel by William Devereux. They also presented a charter the Bishop of Hereford, which later confirmed the original grant. They argued that the granting of the claim of Cecilia Devereux had occurred too quickly for them to respond, and when they had discovered that it had occurred they began the proceedings to regain their rights. On the payment of 40 shillings, the sheriff was ordered to have a jury assembled on 26 November 1206. The sheriff failed to gather the jury on this day and the hearing was postponed to January 1207. Hugh, Dean of Hereford, put Walter de la Puille in his place for the hearing now occurring on 29 January 1207. On this date the court found in favor of the Canons of Hereford. On 7 October 1207 Cecilia Devereux was fined 3 marks, and she released her claims and those of her future heirs. The canons paid Cecilia 8 marks, and granted her the privilege of having her name celebrated in Hereford Cathedral at the annual thanksgiving to benefactors, and daily in service of the church of Putley.|$|E
