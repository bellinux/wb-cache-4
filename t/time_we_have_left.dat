40|$|We {{each have}} {{perceptions}} {{of how much}} <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> and {{what we should do}} with it. These perceptions have implications for our treatment of forests. We can no longer take the longevity of trees and forest ecosystems for granted. Our power to change our environment is irresistible. The prevailing ethic of maximising material wealth is sweeping aside natural forests. They simply cannot compete in terms of generating revenue per unit area with land use alternatives such as intensive agriculture or forest plantations. Treating our life and living ecosystems as if they were infinite does not make them so. We need to reformulate an ethic that has a better understanding of time. We need that ethic embedded in policies and institutions that are temporally aware and serve future generations. The latter have no advocate to plead their case. This paper takes a preliminary look at some questions that deserve our attention: What is time? How much time is left? Should we adopt a precautionary approach as a result? What is it worthwhile for us to do with time – what constitutes value within it? Does value change over time? Can we share values without sharin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Rapidly {{changing}} {{land use}} in Southeast Asia threatens plant diversity, {{and reduces the}} <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> to document it. Despite over 200 years of scientific plant exploration, many plant species {{have yet to be}} discovered. Moreover, we still have a very poor understanding of the distribution of known taxa in this biogeographically complex region. We review the current state of biodiversity exploration, using plants in Indonesia as an example. Traditional methods of collecting and describing species have provided a solid foundation for our understanding of plant biodiversity, but are insufficient for the prag-matic task of rapidly discovering and documenting today’s biodiversity before it is gone, because general collecting expeditions tend to be infrequent, and documentation of most new species must await taxonomic revisions many years in the future. Solutions to this exploration and documentation crisis (i) could use the abundant resource of enthusiastic, networked, national biology students, (ii) should employ biodiversity informatics tools to efficiently engage both specialists and parataxonomists, and (iii) might require adoption of new types of a-taxonomy, utilizing increasingly low-cost molecular methods and high resolution photographs.

40|$|Life {{typically}} {{becomes an}} object of reflection when it is seen to be under threat. In particular, humans {{have a tendency to}} engage in thinking about life (instead of just continuing to live it) when being confronted with the prospect of death: be it the death of individuals due to illness, accident or old age; the death of whole ethnic or national groups in wars and other forms of armed conflict; but also of whole populations, be they human or nonhuman. Even though Minimal Ethics for the Anthropocene is first and foremost concerned with life—understood as both a biological and social phenomenon—it is the narrative about the impending death of the human population (i. e., about the extinction of the human species), that provides a context for its argument. “Anthropocene” names a geo-historical period in which humans are said to have become the biggest threat to life on earth. However, rather than as a scientific descriptor, the term serves here primarily as an ethical injunction to think critically about human and nonhuman agency in the universe. Restrained in tone yet ambitious in scope, the book takes some steps towards outlining a minimal ethics thought on a universal scale. The task of such minimal ethics is to consider how humans can assume responsibility for various occurrences in the universe, across different scales, and how they can respond to the tangled mesh of connections and relations unfolding in it. Its goal is not so much to tell us how to live but rather to allow us to rethink “life” and what we can do with it, in whatever <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>left.</b> The book embraces a speculative mode of thinking that is more akin to the artist’s method; it also includes a photographic project by the author...|$|E

Here we were compelled to walk some distance to cross the Pont de Jena, and again to make a considerable circuit through Passy, {{on account of the}} gardens, in order to do justice to our task. About this time the commodore fairly fell astern; and he discovered that the other boot was too large. I kept talking to him over my shoulder, and cheering him on, and he felicitated me on frogs agreeing so well with my constitution. At length we came in at the Barrière de Clichy, just as the clocks struck three, or in four hours, to a minute, from the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> the same spot. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> neither stopped, eaten, nor drunk a mouthful.

40|$|John Terborgh (1989) {{wrote a book}} {{entitled}} 2 ̆ 2 Where Have All the Birds Gone? 2 ̆ 2 and numerous other articles on the same theme. There was {{an article in the}} Lincoln, NE Sunday Journal-Star, June 19, 1994 concerning dwindling bird numbers on the grasslands. The answer to declining bird numbers is the degradation, fragmentation, and loss of habitats. Sometimes ornithologists disagree on whether the breeding habitats or wintering habitats are impacted most, yet there is nearly universal agreement that habitat is the key. Further evidence for the impact of humans on birds can be obtained by noting those species that are flourishing in human-modified environments. Examples of these include Cattle Egret, Ring-necked Pheasant, Northern Bobwhite, Rock Dove, European Starling, House Finch, and House Sparrow. The easy answer is to blame someone else - the Department of Roads, developers, farmers, or urban sprawl. However, I am to blame and so are you, your neighbor, and all other humans. In the rest of this article, I will discuss how we impact habitats. The causes are apparent, but how we deal with them will continue to be debatable.

Meanwhile, I saw the wise mule led up into the bush; and, on asking its owner why, was told that she was to be fed--on what, I could not see. But, much to my amusement, he cut down a quantity of the young leaves of the Cocorite palm; and she began to eat them greedily, as did my police-horse. And, when the bamboo stoups were brought out, and three-quarters of a pint of good soup was served round--not forgetting the Negroes, one of whom, after sucking it down, rubbed his stomach, and declared, with a grin, that it was very good Obeah- -the oddness of the scene came over me. The blazing beach, the misty mountains, the hot trade-wind, the fantastic leaves overhead, the black limbs and faces, the horses eating palm-leaves, and we sitting on logs among the strange ungainly Montrichardias, drinking 'Ramornie' out of bamboo, washing it down with milk from green coconuts--was this, too, a scene in a pantomime?
