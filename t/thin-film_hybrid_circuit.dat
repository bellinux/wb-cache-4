40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 92 - 96) In this thesis, {{a simple}} technique {{has been developed}} which permits {{the design of a}} small, wide-band (4 - 8 GHz), planar (MIC compatible) balun intended to feed the printed circuit dipole elements in a monopulse integrated array. Such a device is also useful in miniaturized microwave subsystems containing mixers, balanced amplifiers and phase shifters. The balun topology consists of a TEE section high pass filter (HPF) and a transmission line low pass filter (LPF) fed with a Wilkinson hybrid power divider. These filters have supplementary (i. e. 180 degree) differential phase characteristics and their slopes have been adjusted via computer to maintain this relationship over an octave band. Lumped capacitors and resistors, plus transmission line inductors are the quasi-lumped elements used in this realization. This type of network is planar and can be readily fabricated as a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) or a <b>thin-film</b> <b>hybrid</b> microwave integrated <b>circuit</b> (MIC). Initial element values are obtained using a single frequency design based on Image Parameters. The HPF consists of a number of identical cascaded, lumped TEE sections and the LPF is a 90 degree uniform transmission line. Perfect isolation has been assumed. Next, a three-port phase optimization of the entire balun was then performed over an octave frequency band. Insertion loss was then examined. The lumped inductors were replaced by transmission lin~s and the circuit was re-optimized. Acceptable performance was achieved with a balun containing a two section BPF. The resulting phase shift was 180 + 6 /- 4. 5 degrees and the insertion loss went from a maximum of 1. 15 dB at 4 GBz to a low of 0. 153 dB at 8 GHz. The result is a set of designs based on well understood models with little or no parasitic elements...|$|R
