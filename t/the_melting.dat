5|$|<b>The</b> <b>melting</b> {{point of}} iron is {{experimentally}} well defined for pressures less than 50GPa. For greater pressures, studies put the γ-ε-liquid triple point at pressures that differ by tens of gigapascals and 1000K in <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> point. Generally speaking, molecular dynamics computer simulations of iron melting and shock wave experiments suggest higher melting points {{and a much}} steeper slope of <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> curve than static experiments carried out in diamond anvil cells. <b>The</b> <b>melting</b> and boiling points of iron, along with its enthalpy of atomization, are {{lower than those of}} the earlier 3d elements from scandium to chromium, showing the lessened contribution of the 3d electrons to metallic bonding as they are attracted more and more into the inert core by the nucleus; however, they are higher than the values for the previous element manganese because that element has a half-filled 3d subshell and consequently its d-electrons are not easily delocalized. This same trend appears for ruthenium but not osmium.|$|E
5|$|A {{snow melting}} vehicle works by {{scooping}} snow into a melting pit {{located in a}} large tank {{at the rear of}} the vehicle. Around <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> pit is a thin jacket full of warm water, heated by a powerful burner. The gases from the burner are bubbled through the water, causing some of the heated water to spill over into <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> pit, melting the snow instantly. The meltwater is discharged into the storm drains.|$|E

50|$|The metal {{is first}} melted {{in contact with}} a carbon source, {{possibly}} a graphite crucible inside which <b>the</b> <b>melt</b> is carried out or graphite powder/chunks that are placed in <b>the</b> <b>melt.</b> Keeping <b>the</b> <b>melt</b> {{in contact with the}} carbon at a specific temperature dissolves the carbon atoms, saturating <b>the</b> <b>melt</b> based on <b>the</b> metal-carbon binary phase diagram. Lowering the temperature decreases carbon's solubility and the excess carbon precipitates onto <b>the</b> <b>melt.</b> <b>The</b> floating layer can be either skimmed or frozen for later removal.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>melting</b> {{point of}} gallium, at 302.9146K (29.7646°C, 85.5763°F), is just above room temperature, and is {{approximately}} {{the same as the}} average summer daytime temperatures in Earth's mid-latitudes. This melting point (mp) is one of the formal temperature reference points in the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) established by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). The triple point of gallium, 302.9166K (29.7666°C, 85.5799°F), is used by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in preference to <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> point.|$|E
5|$|The self-damage {{induced by}} the {{radioactivity}} of einsteinium {{is so strong that}} it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice, and the energy release during this process, 1000 watts per gram of 253Es, induces a visible glow. These processes may contribute to the relatively low density and melting point of einsteinium. Further, owing to the small size of the available samples, <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> point of einsteinium was often deduced by observing the sample being heated inside an electron microscope. Thus the surface effects in small samples could reduce <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> point value.|$|E
40|$|A {{process and}} {{apparatus}} is disclosed for growing a crystal ribbon of a substance of theoretically infinite length from a <b>melt</b> of <b>the</b> substance.

The unusually low melting point of neptunium and plutonium (~640°C) is explained by hybridization of 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in these metals.|$|E

5|$|In 1529, Georgius Agricola {{described}} fluorite as an additive used {{to lower}} <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> point of metals during smelting.

40|$|Polypropylene (PP) {{composites}} {{filled with}} multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were prepared using a twin-screw extruder. <b>The</b> <b>melt</b> flow {{properties of the}} composites were measured with a capillary rheometer in a temperature range from 180 to 230 °C and at various apparent shear rates varying from 100 to 4000 s- 1.

50|$|Hydrogen forms {{whenever}} molten aluminium {{comes into}} contact with water vapor, and easily dissolves into <b>the</b> <b>melt.</b> <b>The</b> gas tends {{to come out of}} the solution and forms bubbles when <b>the</b> <b>melt</b> solidifies.|$|R
5|$|Lithium {{was used}} to {{decrease}} <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> temperature of glass and to improve <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> behavior of aluminium oxide when using the Hall-Héroult process. These two uses dominated the market {{until the middle of}} the 1990s. After the end of the nuclear arms race, the demand for lithium decreased and the sale of Department of Energy stockpiles on the open market further reduced prices. In the mid 1990s, several companies started to extract lithium from brine which proved to be a less expensive than underground or open-pit mining. Most of the mines closed or shifted their focus to other materials because only the ore from zoned pegmatites could be mined for a competitive price. For example, the US mines near Kings Mountain, North Carolina closed before the beginning of the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Many {{properties}} of promethium rely on its position among lanthanides and are intermediate between those of neodymium and samarium. For example, <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> point, {{the first three}} ionization energies, and the hydration energy are greater than those of neodymium and {{lower than those of}} samarium; similarly, the estimate for the boiling point, ionic (Pm3+) radius, and standard heat of formation of monatomic gas are greater than those of samarium and less those of neodymium.|$|E
5|$|Most ionic {{compounds}} {{are very}} brittle. Once {{they reach the}} limit of their strength, they cannot deform mealleably, because the strict alignment {{of positive and negative}} ions must be maintained. Instead the material undergoes fracture via cleavage. As the temperature is elevated (usually close to <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> point) a ductile–brittle transition occurs, and plastic flow becomes possible by the motion of dislocations.|$|E
50|$|This nozzle type is {{fitted with}} a {{rotatable}} bolt assembly which has a cavity equal in size to <b>the</b> <b>melt</b> channel. In its open position, the bolt cavity is directly aligned with <b>the</b> <b>melt</b> stream. When <b>the</b> actuator rotates the bolt assembly, the cavity becomes misaligned and thus shuts of <b>the</b> <b>melt</b> flow.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{partially}} confined configuration {{is proposed}} for the crystal growth of semiconductors from <b>the</b> <b>melt,</b> including those with volatile constituents.

5|$|Rhodium is a hard, silvery, durable {{metal that}} has a high reflectance. Rhodium metal does not {{normally}} form an oxide, even when heated.

50|$|An {{alternative}} {{approach is the}} tilt-pour furnace whereby an induction furnace is tilted to pour <b>the</b> <b>melt</b> into a conical tundish that in turn delivers the molten metal to <b>the</b> <b>melt</b> delivery nozzle. <b>The</b> tilt pour system provides <b>the</b> advantage that <b>melting</b> is decoupled from the spraying procedure so that melting problems and remedial solutions do not affect or disturb the critical set-up of <b>the</b> <b>melt</b> delivery nozzle.|$|R
5|$|Sodium is now {{produced}} commercially {{through the}} electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, {{based on a}} process patented in 1924.
