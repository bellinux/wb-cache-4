From 1938, various forms of Flecktarn camouflage were issued. The author Adrian Weale doubts Berger's account.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the plan, Ivan and his cavalry approached Constantinople while Michael Shishman waited in Yambol with his army. The plot was uncovered by the spies of Andronikos III. Fearing for his own imperial ambitions, {{he wrote to his}} rival and grandfather not to accept the Bulgarians into the capital. While Ivan stuck to the plan and signed an oath <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> with peace to persuade the Byzantines, he promptly retreated to Bulgarian territory upon receiving that order from Michael Shishman.|$|E
5|$|On January 28, Khánh {{flew from}} Huế to Saigon dressed in {{civilian}} clothes on a commercial airliner. He covered for his ruse by claiming that he was travelling with United States military adviser Colonel Jasper Wilson and stating <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> for a dental appointment. This came after Duc had arrived in I Corps {{earlier in the day}} with a message from the other plotters that Khánh was to be in Saigon to lead the coup on the day after. What Khánh had actually done was to send Wilson to Saigon earlier in the day to check with the embassy and confirm that Washington did support the coup.|$|E

5|$|Suleiman said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> {{to protect}} John Sigismund's interests, but also {{announced}} {{that he wanted to}} see the infant king, because he had heard rumours about Isabella's having actually given birth to a daughter. Six Hungarian lords (including George Martinuzzi and Bálint Török) accompanied John Sigismund to the sultan's camp on 29August. During the meeting, janissaries entered Buda, saying that they wanted to see the town. This {{turned out to be a}} trick that enabled them to seize the capital of Hungary without opposition. Bálint Török was captured in the sultan's camp. Suleiman declared that John Sigismund could retain the territories to the east of the river Tisza in exchange for a yearly tribute of 10,000 florins.|$|E
5|$|Norman Osborn {{is shown}} to be {{severely}} manic depressive. This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider-Man stories. When he is not {{under the direction of}} a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings. At the apex of his mania, he is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations, including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror rather than his own. Previously, Osborn's arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to; he viewed mental illness as an imperfection and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill. In later conversations with the Sentry, Osborn revealed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to accept his own mental illness. After having rid of his powers after the confrontation with the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus), Osborn's sanity apparently restored but remains a villain.|$|E
5|$|The realist {{narrative}} {{style of}} Pather Panchali {{was influenced by}} Italian neorealism and the works of French director Jean Renoir. In 1949 Renoir came to Calcutta to shoot his film The River (1951). Ray, {{a founding member of}} the Calcutta Film Society (established in 1947), helped him scout for locations in the countryside. When Ray told him about his longstanding wish to film Pather Panchali, Renoir encouraged him to proceed. In 1950 Ray was sent to London by his employer, the advertising agency D.J. Keymer, to work at their headquarters. During his six months in London, he watched about 100 films. Among these, Vittorio De Sica's neorealist film Bicycle Thieves (1948) had a profound impact on him. In a 1982 lecture, Ray said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> out of the theatre determined to become a filmmaker. The film made him believe that it was possible to make realistic cinema that was shot on location with an amateur cast.|$|E

5|$|Antigonus {{attempted}} to exploit Pyrrhus' absence from Macedon by launching an invasion to reclaim his kingdom. However, his attack on Macedon was unsuccessful {{as he was}} defeated in battle by Pyrrhus' son, Ptolemy. Unperturbed by Antigonus' offensive, Pyrrhus advanced into the Peloponnese where he was welcomed in Achaia. The Epiriote army marched to Megalopolis, a central Peloponnesian city which lay {{on the border with}} Sparta. Several of Sparta's neighbours, namely Megalopolis, Elis and many of the Achaians poleis, supported Pyrrhus invasion as they would profit from the reduction of Spartan influence in the region. While his force was camped at Megalopolis, Pyrrhus received ambassadors from Messene, Athens, the Achaian League and Sparta. In response to the Spartans' inquires as to the reasons for his Peloponnesian incursion, Pyrrhus managed to dupe the envoys. He told the Spartans <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to liberate any cities still held by Antigonus and that he hoped to send his sons to Sparta to obtain a traditional education at the agoge. However, when the emissaries returned to Sparta, Pyrrhus advanced into Laconia. He advanced south, following the course of the Eurotas River and ravaging the lands of the Spartan perioeci. It may have been at this time that Pyrrhus assigned Cleonymus a series of independent commands as he is recorded as subjugating the city of Alifeira in Elis as well as sacking Zarax in the Parnon region of Laconia. Pyrrhus' perfidy was met with anger in Sparta and ambassadors were immediately sent to Pyrrhus to rebuke him.|$|E

25|$|While {{he faced}} much {{opposition}} and personal difficulties, Bacha Khan Khan worked tirelessly to organise {{and raise the}} consciousness of his fellow Pushtuns.

25|$|In {{the initial}} questioning, {{it comes to}} light that the {{previous}} owner of the house, Sellon, {{was found dead in}} his shop, supposedly from a fall down the stairs, but it might have been more nefarious than that.

Münch had stated {{that he had been}} forced into the Waffen-SS and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to Birkenau at the end of 1944.
