5|$|In February {{following}} the reassertion {{of the central}} government's authority in Katanga, the UN began phasing out its peacekeeping force, {{with the goal of}} completing a total withdrawal {{by the end of the}} year. At the government's request, the UN authorised a six-month extension to ONUC's deployment, albeit with a reduced number of personnel. The last troops left the Congo on 30 June 1964. The civilian aid mission remained longer to provide <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>to</b> the government.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the armed conflict, there are other explanations for this situation: Municipalities tend to use their financial resources from the Sistema General de Participaciones or General Participation System (Law 715 of 2001) mainly in urban areas. Furthermore, there is no institution or program {{at the national level}} which offers <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>to</b> the 12,000 rural community organizations. Law 142 of 1994 assigns that task to the departments, but these have not carried out the task in a satisfactory way so far.|$|E

Other important reserves are located in Chile, China, and Brazil. Since 2006 the Bolivian government have nationalized oil and gas projects and is keeping a tight control over mining its lithium reserves. Already the Japanese and South Korean governments, as well as companies from these two countries and France, have offered <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>to</b> develop Bolivia's lithium reserves and are seeking {{to gain access to the}} lithium resources through a mining and industrialization model suitable to Bolivian interests.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the heavy}} {{damage from the}} cyclone and other recent disasters, the World Bank enacted a plan for Andhra Pradesh in April 1997, {{consisting}} of repairing damaged infrastructure, an updated disaster plan, and <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>to</b> the state government. Shelters and roads would be improved to higher standards. This plan ultimately cost about US$175million and was completed in July 2003, three years longer than expected but {{at a lower cost}} due to the Indian rupee losing some of its value. Power lines were improved to withstand winds of , while drains were enlarged and a coastal plant system was created to lessen flooding. An additional 82public shelters were constructed. However, the plan failed to yield a long term disaster policy for the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{deposition}} (and eventual murder) of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba caused further {{issues in}} the country, leading to the declaration of a rival government in Stanleyville {{by the end of}} the year. To prevent a complete collapse of order within the country, the United Nations established a major peacekeeping mission, the United Nations Operation in the Congo (known under its French acronym as ONUC). In addition to a large body of troops (20,000 at its peak strength), a civilian mission was brought in to provide <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>to</b> the Congolese government. Initially, ONUC limited its actions to ensuring the safety of Congolese citizens and foreign nationals and withheld from acting against the secessionist states, but the UN ran into trouble in Katanga. The state's leader and head of the locally entrenched Confédération des associations tribales du Katanga (CONAKAT), Moïse Tshombe, at first banned the UN from entering his territory and then greatly limited their peacekeeping efforts. Further issues derived from peacekeepers' attempts to deport foreign mercenaries, many of whom were employed by Katanga.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} component of the Bretton Woods agreements was the creation of two new international financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Collectively referred to as the Bretton Woods institutions, they became operational in 1947 and 1946 respectively. The IMF was established to support the monetary system by facilitating cooperation on international monetary issues, providing advisory and <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>to</b> members, and offering emergency lending to nations experiencing repeated difficulties restoring the balance of payments equilibrium. Members would contribute funds to a pool according to their share of gross world product, from which emergency loans could be issued. Member states were authorized and encouraged to employ capital controls as necessary to manage payments imbalances and meet pegging targets, but prohibited from relying on IMF financing to cover particularly short-term capital hemorrhages. While the IMF was instituted to guide members and provide a short-term financing window for recurrent balance of payments deficits, the IBRD was established to serve as a type of financial intermediary for channeling global capital toward long-term investment opportunities and postwar reconstruction projects. The creation of these organizations was a crucial milestone {{in the evolution of the}} international financial architecture, and some economists consider it the most significant achievement of multilateral cooperation following World War II. Since the establishment of the International Development Association (IDA) in 1960, the IBRD and IDA are together known as the World Bank. While the IBRD lends to middle-income developing countries, the IDA extends the Bank's lending program by offering concessional loans and grants to the world's poorest nations.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia {{established}} {{diplomatic ties}} with North Vietnam on 31 March 1973 at the ambassadorial level after the Paris Peace Accords were signed that year. An {{agreement between the}} ambassadors of Malaysia and Vietnam was reached in 1975. The following year, Malaysia first opened its embassy in Hanoi, while Vietnam also opened its embassy in Kuala Lumpur on 29 May 1976. In {{the mid to late}} 1970s, bilateral ties were strained as Malaysia pressured Vietnam to embrace the ZOPFAN concept, which the latter interpreted as a version of the anti-communist containment policy. During a bilateral summit in August 1977, Malaysia's Prime Minister Hussein Onn made promises to provide economic and <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>to</b> rebuild Vietnam's war-torn economy. When Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1979, many Vietnamese sought refuge in Malaysia from that time onwards and into the 1980s, and caused economic and national security problems to Malaysia especially to its racial balance as most the Vietnamese refugees resemble the Chinese people. Bilateral ties normalised from 1988 onwards, when Vietnam announced plans to withdraw from Cambodia. In the early 1990s, government leaders of both countries held several diplomatic visits and summits, which produced many agreements that emphasised economic co-operation and development. Strengthening ties also saw the opening of a consulate office in Ho Chi Minh City in January 1991. Vietnam expressed its interest in joining ASEAN with Malaysia's support in 1994 as the countries continued to foster close economic ties. Vietnam joined ASEAN in 1995; its entry was warmly welcomed by Malaysia.|$|E
