500|$|A dive {{profile is}} a {{description}} of a diver's pressure exposure over time. [...] It may be as simple as just a depth and time pair, as in: [...] "sixty for twenty," [...] (a stay of 20 minutes at a depth of 60 feet) or as complex as a second by second graphical representation of depth and time recorded by a personal dive computer. Several common types of dive profile are specifically named, and these may be characteristic of the purpose of the dive. For example, a working dive at a limited location will often follow a constant depth (square) profile, and a recreational dive is likely to follow a multilevel profile, as the divers start deep and work their way up a reef <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>out</b> of the available breathing gas. The names are usually descriptive of the graphic appearance.|$|E
500|$|In Super Street Fighter IV, the {{developers}} attempted to retain Ibuki's playstyle and feel from Street Fighter III. She was also given a super jump (the only character, other than C. Viper, {{to have one}} in this game) and made adjustments to have combos that utilize it. Capcom's Taketoshi Sano said that [...] "Ibuki is suited to those who want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>out</b> of a single character" [...] and [...] "beginners can use her too, but if I had to pick I'd say she's suited for intermediate." [...] Capcom Europe described Ibuki’s [...] "Raida" [...] ("Thunder Strike") command grab as having some unique properties and {{being one of the}} most powerful moves in the game. According to an MTV guide, Ibuki is [...] "one of the hardest characters to master in this latest iteration" [...] and players need to gain [...] "a strong understanding of each character's moves and abilities before truly coming to grips with what the weak, yet versatile Ibuki has to offer." ...|$|E
500|$|On the Turkish side, by {{that night}} the 2nd Battalion 57th Infantry were on Baby 700, the 3rd Battalion, reduced to only ninety men, were at The Nek, and the 1st Battalion on Mortar Ridge. Just south {{of them was the}} 77th Infantry, next was the 27th Infantry {{opposite}} 400 Plateau. The last regiment, the 72nd Infantry, were on Battleship Hill. As for manpower, the Turks were in a similar situation to the ANZACs. Of the two regiments most heavily involved, the 57th had been destroyed, and the 27th were exhausted with heavy casualties. Large numbers of the 77th had deserted, and the regiment was in no condition to fight. The 72nd was largely intact, but they were a poorly trained force of Arab conscripts. The III Corps, having to deal with both landings, could not assist as they had no reserves available. It was not until 27 April that the 33rd and 64th Infantry Regiments arrived to reinforce the Turkish forces. The ANZACs, however, had been unable to achieve their obectives, and therefore dug in. Gallipoli, like the Western Front, turned into a war of attrition. The German commander, Liman von Saunders, was clear about the reasons for the outcome. He wrote that, [...] "on the Turkish side the situation was saved by the immediate and independent action of the 19th Division." [...] The division commander, Kemal, became noted as [...] "the most imaginative, most successful officer to fight on either side" [...] during the campaign. As a commander he was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>out</b> of his troops, typified by his order to the 57th Infantry Regiment; [...] "Men, I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die. In the time that it takes us to die, other forces and commanders can come and take our place." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Canada, Lee's parents {{gave him}} a Jewish education, with a bar mitzvah at age 13. His father was a skilled musician, but died the year before from medical {{problems}} resulting from his imprisonment. This forced his mother to find outside work to support three children. Lee feels that not having parents at home during those years was probably a factor in his becoming a musician: [...] "It was a terrible blow that I lost him, but {{the course of my}} life changed because my mother couldn't control us." [...] He said that losing his father at such an early age made him aware of how [...] "quickly life can disappear", which inspired him from then on <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>out</b> of his life and music.|$|E

2500|$|Members of Alter Bridge met in December 2012 {{to discuss}} the next album and the future tour of the band. They entered the studio in January 2013 to begin {{recording}} the new album, while touring intermittently with their respective side projects. Recording continued in late April 2013 and lasted till July 2013 with their producer Michael [...] "Elvis" [...] Baskette. The album was confirmed to be called Fortress. On July 31, 2013, Alter Bridge revealed album cover and track listing for Fortress, and the first single, [...] "Addicted to Pain", was officially released on August 12, 2013. Mark Tremonti said that the band tried to [...] "challenge ourselves <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>out</b> of the arrangements" [...] and that the album is a [...] "high energy record". The band streamed the album in its entirety on the Metal Hammer website as a UK exclusive on September 23. Fortress was released everywhere by September 30, 2013 except in the US, where it was released on October 8. The album received critical acclaim, with Allmusic saying [...] "Fortress is a driving album that not only doesn't feel tired or stale, but is a monster of an album that makes a pretty solid case for being some of Alter Bridge's strongest and most dynamic work to date." [...] Their second and third singles [...] "Cry of Achilles" [...] and [...] "Waters Rising" [...] performed relatively well at the charts, achieving 27 and 15 place at US Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks.|$|E

It’s just so much slush and sentiment, and you must see it yourself, at least for one who {{does not believe in}} eternal life. With immortality before me, altruism would be a paying business proposition. I might elevate my soul to all kinds of altitudes. But with nothing eternal before me but death, given for a brief spell this yeasty crawling and squirming which is called life, why, it would be immoral for me to perform any act that was a sacrifice. Any sacrifice that makes me lose one crawl or squirm is foolish,—and not only foolish, for it is a wrong against myself and a wicked thing. I must not lose one crawl or squirm if I am <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>out</b> of the ferment. Nor will the eternal movelessness that is coming to me be made easier or harder by the sacrifices or selfishnesses of the time when I was yeasty and acrawl.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Vanity Fair (1847--1848) is {{the best}} known of Thackeray's novels. It was his first great work, and was {{intended}} to express his own views of the social life about him, and to protest against the overdrawn heroes of popular novels. He takes for his subject that Vanity Fair to which Christian and Faithful were conducted {{on their way to the}} Heavenly City, as recorded in Pilgrim's Progress. In this fair there are many different booths, given over to the sale of [...] "all sorts of vanities," [...] and as we go from one to another we come in contact with [...] "juggling, cheats, games, plays, fools, apes, knaves, rogues, and that of every kind." [...] Evidently this is a picture of one side of social life; but the difference between Bunyan and Thackeray is simply this,--that Bunyan made Vanity Fair a small incident in a long journey, a place through which most of us pass on our way to better things; while Thackeray, describing high society in his own day, makes it a place of long sojourn, wherein his characters spend the greater part of their lives. Thackeray styles this work [...] "a novel without a hero." [...] The whole action of the story, which is without plot or development, revolves about two women,--Amelia, a meek creature of the milk-and-water type, and Becky Sharp, a keen, unprincipled intriguer, who lets nothing stand in the way of her selfish desire <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>out</b> of the fools who largely constitute society. On the whole, it is the most powerful but not the most wholesome of Thackeray's works.|$|E
60|$|I think so. If I {{may make}} a {{suggestion}} without seeming {{to be trying to}} teach my grandmother to suck eggs, I will offer it. In our days we have learned the value of combination. We apply it everywhere--in railway systems, in trusts, in trade unions, in Salvation Armies, in minor politics, in major politics, in European Concerts. Whatever our strength may be, big or little, we organise it. We have found out that that is the only way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>out</b> of it that is in it. We know the weakness of individual sticks, and the strength of the concentrated faggot. Suppose you try a scheme like this, for instance. In England and America put every Jew on the census-book as a Jew (in case you have not been doing that). Get up volunteer regiments composed of Jews solely, and when the drum beats, fall in and go to the front, so as to remove the reproach that you have few Massenas among you, and that you feed on a country but don't like to fight for it. Next, in politics, organise your strength, band together, and deliver the casting-vote where you can, and, where you can't, compel as good terms as possible. You huddle to yourselves already in all countries, but you huddle to no sufficient purpose, politically speaking. You {{do not seem to be}} organised, except for your charities. There you are omnipotent; there you compel your due of recognition--you do not have to beg for it. It shows what you can do when you band together for a definite purpose.|$|E
