5|$|The {{similarity}} of these symbionts in the genus Cryptocercus {{to those in}} termites are such that these cockroaches have been suggested to be {{more closely related to}} termites than to other cockroaches, and current research strongly supports <b>this</b> <b>hypothesis</b> about their relationships. All species studied so far carry the obligate mutualistic endosymbiont bacterium Blattabacterium, with the exception of Nocticola australiensise, an Australian cave-dwelling species without eyes, pigment or wings, which recent genetic studies indicate is a very primitive cockroach. It had previously been thought that all five families of cockroach were descended from a common ancestor that was infected with B. cuenoti. It may be that N. australiensise subsequently lost its symbionts, or alternatively <b>this</b> <b>hypothesis</b> will need to be re-examined.|$|E

It has nevertheless been suggested that, if the hypotheses is correct, the sculptures would have been arranged at the East and West side of the serpentine-shaped necropolis, to form a sort of gigantic human exedra reminiscent of the half-circle exedra of a Giants’ grave. The boxers could have formed the most external part of this arrangement, whereas archers and warriors would have been located in the center, immediately next to the tombs.
