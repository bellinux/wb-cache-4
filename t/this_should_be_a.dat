25|$|The maguari stork is {{evaluated}} {{as being}} of least concern {{because it has}} an extremely large geographical range, and an apparently stable world population that is suspected to be very large. Despite local declines {{in some parts of}} its range, the population is not considered to be threatened on a global scale. However, even though this stork appears to be numerous throughout its natural habitat, census data are lacking and {{there appears to be no}} current estimate of the world population. <b>This</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> new target of conservationists, and a clearer overview of this stork's world status could be aided by carrying out numerous aerial surveys of nesting areas.|$|E

To address this, as well as space limitations, some developers have produced special versions of operating systems (such as Linux in Live USB) or commonplace applications (such as Mozilla Firefox) designed to run from flash drives. These are typically optimized for size and configured to place temporary or intermediate files in the computer's main RAM rather than store them temporarily on the flash drive.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{has started}} on the road level part between station K1 and K5 so far. <b>This</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> tram based LRT and {{although}} the official Transportation Department claims that this line is still under planning, work has been ongoing since April 2016. From station K6 to K9 the tracks will be elevated. The initial work between station K6 and K7 have been done and is clearly visible on Google maps. It's passing through a cemetery and will be going across Ankang Road. It's currently unknown when this line is planned to open, but as it connects to station Y7 on the circular line (also known as line 6) which is still under construction, it's unlikely to open until that line is finished.|$|E

500|$|The PSP {{ports of}} Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars {{have had a}} {{somewhat}} better reception than other ports. Reviews have complimented the game on the multiplayer additions {{and the ability to}} add a custom soundtrack – which led IGN to comment that [...] "Including <b>this</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> no-brainer, but many PSP titles don't" [...] – but have noted some graphical glitches, the long loading times, and the lack of the original soundtracks for the games. The reviews of the controls of the game have mixed, with some praising the scheme on the PSP, while others have stated that the controls feel stiff and inconsistent. GameSpot's review noted that the gameplay in Crazy Taxi does not hold up well compared to more recent racing games across various platforms.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the release and high-profile return to Libya of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi in August 2009, speculation about the possible involvement of the UK Government in the Scottish Government's decision to release him grew, particularly after Saif Gaddafi, the son of Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi, said that Megrahi's case had been discussed during business talks with the UK, and after Colonel Gaddafi thanked Brown for [...] "encouraging" [...] the release. This prompted Downing Street to confirm that Brown had discussed a possible release with Gaddafi during the G8 summit in Italy in July 2009, but that a letter sent by Brown to the Libyan leader had stated, [...] "When we met I stressed that, should the Scottish Government decide that Megrahi can return to Libya, <b>this</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> purely private, family occasion".|$|E

Upon being alerted by {{the approach}} of Sam Wilson's task force by a robot version of Edwin Jarvis, the Ultron/Hank Pym decides to give his [...] "family" [...] a warm welcome. When Tony Stark A.I.'s team and Captain America's team confront each other, they are captured by the Ultron/Hank Pym who forces both teams to sit at a dinner table. The Ultron/Hank Pym argues that he is doing this because the Avengers have become less of a family over the years as so many of them jump to obey Captain America or Iron Man despite past experience confirming that <b>this</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> bad idea, but the Tony Stark A.I. counters that the only reason the team failed as a family was because of Hank Pym's attack on Wasp. Outraged, the Ultron/Hank Pym nearly attacks the other heroes, but Scott Lang is able to talk him down by arguing that Hank Pym remains his own inspiration. The Ultron/Hank Pym allows the Tony Stark A.I.'s team to leave with the fragment, arguing that he will leave Captain America's plans with Hydra alone as it appears to be the best chance for world peace.|$|E
