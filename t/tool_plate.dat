40|$|International audienceFiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) composites {{are widely}} used in various fields such as automobile, marine, and aerospace industries. The majority of large FRP composites are fabricated via wet lay-up/vacuum bag (WLVB) technique, primarily due to its low cost, flexibility, and convenience of use. However, {{the lack of a}} high consolidation pressure applied during cure leads to non-uniform part thickness, high void content, and inferior mechanical properties. To enhance the quality of composite laminates made by WLVB, a novel process, Magnet Assisted Composite Manufacturing (MACM), has been recently proposed [1]. In MACM/WLVB process, uncured WLVB lay-up is consolidated between a set of high-power permanent magnets and a magnetic <b>tool</b> <b>plate.</b> The objective of the present study is to elucidate effects of MACM/WLVB process on the improvements in quality and mechanical properties of composites with different resin systems. Towards this goal, the following two resin systems with different viscosities are used to impregnate random mat E-glass fabric: (i) Epon 862 /Epicure 3300 with a moderately low viscosity of 769 mPa s; and (ii) INF- 114 /INF- 211 with a very low viscosity of 296 mPa s. Considering final thicknesses of the lay-up made with type (i) and (ii) resin systems to be 2. 5 mm and 1. 7 mm, respectively, the consolidation pressure of approximately 0. 29 MPa (42 psi) and 0. 36 MPa (52 psi) are generated by the N 52 - 2. 54 × 2. 54 × 1. 27 cm 3 magnets during cure. It is observed that both composites fabricated by MACM/WLVB presented dramatic improvements in the laminate quality compared to those made by the traditional WLVB. However, the laminates made by a very low viscosity resin of 296 mPa s showed higher improvement so that the fiber volume fraction almost doubled and reached 49 %. In addition, the void content decreased by 70 % to less than 1. 5 %, while the flexural properties enhanced by more than 60 %, validating the effectiveness of using high power magnets in manufacturing of composites...|$|E
