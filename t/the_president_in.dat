5|$|By the 1980s, Suharto's grip {{on power}} was {{maintained}} by the emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, {{and use of the}} military's coercive powers. Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook a re-organisation of the armed forces that concentrated power away from commanders to <b>the</b> <b>president.</b> <b>In</b> March 1983, he appointed General Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani as head of the armed forces who adopted a hardline on elements who challenged the administration. As a Roman Catholic, he was not a political threat to Suharto.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Bedell {{had decided to}} run for {{political}} office. In 1972, he ran against Wiley Mayne, a Republican incumbent in Iowa's 6th congressional district. Mayne was a staunch supporter of Richard Nixon and secured victory along with <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>in</b> a year favorable to the Republicans. Mayne, however, would politically suffer after Watergate (he was one of only a few Republicans to vote against impeaching the President on the judiciary committee.) The damage had already been done, and Bedell defeated Mayne in a 1974 rematch.|$|E
5|$|Guiteau {{was indicted}} on October 14, 1881, {{for the murder}} of <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> <b>In</b> a chaotic trial in which Guiteau often {{interrupted}} and argued, and in which his counsel used the insanity defense, the jury found him guilty on January 5, 1882, and he was sentenced to death by hanging. Guiteau might have had neurosyphilis, a disease that causes physiological mental impairment. He was executed on June 30, 1882.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, Evita set her {{sights on}} earning {{a place on}} the ballot as {{candidate}} for vice-president. This move angered many military leaders who despised Evita and her increasing powers within the government. According to the Argentine Constitution, the Vice President automatically succeeds <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>in</b> the event of the President's death. The possibility of Evita becoming president in the event of Juan Perón's death was not something the military could accept.|$|E
5|$|Indian-American student Pranav Sivakumar {{was praised}} by <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>in</b> his {{speech at the}} event.

Obama cited Sivakumar as an example of the outstanding students that attended the stargazing event at the White House.|$|E

5|$|Under the Belarus Constitution (Part 4, Chapter 3, Article 84), the President of the Republic has {{the power}} to bestow state awards. To {{announce}} an award, the President issues a decree conferring the title to a person. Within two months, the title will be presented by <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>in</b> a formal setting, usually at the Presidential Palace in the capital city of Minsk. A certificate (gramota) will also be presented to the recipient, signed by the President of the Republic.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the current}} {{constitution}} of Sri Lanka, the Prime Minister {{is the leader}} of the Cabinet business and also functions as a deputy to <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> <b>In</b> the event a president dies in office, the Prime Minister becomes the acting president until the Parliament convens to elect a successor or new elections can be held to elect a new president. This was the case in 1993, when President Ranasinghe Premadasa was assassinated and Prime Minister Dingiri Banda Wijetunge took office as President.|$|E

5|$|And so matters stood {{until the}} massive PAVN/NLF Tet Offensive of early 1968. Although a {{tactical}} victory for American and South Vietnamese forces, Tet became a political disaster. The American public (who had been reassured by President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Pentagon that the communists were incapable of launching any such actions) were {{stunned by the}} size and ferocity of the offensive. The {{light at the end}} of the tunnel had been extinguished, if it had ever existed at all. <b>The</b> <b>president,</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to nudge Hanoi to the negotiating table, decreed an end to bombing operations in North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel, effectively ending Rolling Thunder on 11 November 1968.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the afternoon, nearly 300armed men had {{converged on}} the lawn of the State Capitol. Brooks' men seized the state arsenal and began turning the Statehouse into an armed camp. Telegrams covered in {{signatures}} were sent to President Ulysses S. Grant supporting Brooks as the legal governor. Three out of the five Supreme Court justices also telegraphed <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>in</b> support of Brooks. Brooks telegraphed the President himself asking for access to weapons housed at the federal arsenal. He also issued a statement to the press proclaiming himself governor. The senators from the state, Clayton and Steven Dorsey, met with President Grant, and they sent a message to Brooks giving their support.|$|E
5|$|Following the 11 September 2001 {{attacks on}} the United States, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf {{announced}} {{his support for the}} US-led War on Terror. This declaration sparked conflict with the Lal Masjid, whose leadership was openly pro-Taliban. Abdul Aziz and Abdul Rashid denied having any links to banned terrorist organisations but were vehemently opposed to the War on Terror and the conflict in Afghanistan. They openly condemned Musharraf and opposed Pakistani security forces, including the Pakistan Rangers and Islamabad Capital Territory police. The mosque became a source for speeches calling for the assassination of Musharraf. One of these speeches was delivered by Masood Azhar, whose Jaish-e-Mohammed group members were later involved in failed attempts to kill <b>the</b> <b>president.</b> <b>In</b> July 2005, Pakistani authorities attempted to raid the mosque in connection with their investigation into the July 7, 2005 London bombings, but the police were blocked by baton-wielding female students. After the raid, authorities apologised for the behaviour of the police.|$|E

5|$|His spirits buoyed, Nixon {{sought a}} second term, {{but some of}} Eisenhower's aides aimed to {{displace}} him. In a December 1955 meeting, Eisenhower proposed that Nixon not run for reelection {{in order to give}} him administrative experience before a 1960 presidential run and instead become a Cabinet officer in a second Eisenhower administration. Nixon believed such an action would destroy his political career. When Eisenhower announced his reelection bid in February 1956, he hedged on the choice of his running mate, stating that it was improper to address that question until he had been renominated. Although no Republican was opposing Eisenhower, Nixon received a substantial number of write-in votes against <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>in</b> the 1956 New Hampshire primary election. In late April, the President announced that Nixon would again be his running mate. Eisenhower and Nixon were reelected by a comfortable margin in the November 1956 election.|$|E
5|$|If the Saxbe fix is a {{solution}} for the primary problem of self-dealing, a relevant fact is that Congress has not voted to increase any Cabinet salary or benefits since the 1990s, when it granted that power to <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>in</b> {{the form of an}} across-the-board cost of living adjustment by executive order. However, the Ineligibility Clause does not distinguish between increases in emoluments by legislation, and increases by executive order. Perhaps the most lenient interpretation of self-dealing was made during the 1973 Saxbe hearings by Duke University School of Law professor William Van Alstyne, who argued that the ineligibility clause only applied to new offices created during a congressional term, not to appointments to existing offices.|$|E
5|$|In September 2013, Ortega-Hernandez {{pleaded guilty}} to one count of {{property}} destruction and one count of discharging a firearm during a crime of violence, thereby avoiding the charge of attempting to assassinate <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> <b>In</b> March 2014, {{he was sentenced to}} 25 years' imprisonment.
