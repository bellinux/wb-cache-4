Interventional image guidance thereby offers {{the advantage of}} precisely knowing {{the position of the}} nodules, particularly in small or ground-glass opaque tumors, metastases, and/or patients with reduced pulmonary function. This allows for a precise navigation in biopsies, and resection in VATS.

25|$|VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) is a minimally-invasive {{technique}} to resect lung nodules that saves the patient {{the trauma of}} a thoracotomy. Thereby, small ports are used to access the pulmonary lobes and introduce a camera on a thoracoscope, along with the necessary instruments. While this procedure speeds up recovery and potentially reduces complications, the loss of natural vision and <b>tactile</b> <b>sensing</b> {{makes it difficult for}} the surgeon to locate the nodules, especially in cases of non-superficial, ground-glass opaque, and small lesions. The yield rate for nodules < 1nbsp&cm can be below 40% as studies show. As a consequence sometimes more healthy tissue is resected than actually necessary in order to avoid missing (parts of) the lesion. Using advanced intra-operative imaging in the OR helps to precisely locate and resect the lesion in a potentially tissue-sparing and quick fashion. In {{order to be able to}} use image guidance during VATS, rotational angiography has to be performed before the introduction of ports, thus before the lobe in question deflates. This way the lesion is visible through the natural contrast of air. In a second step, hook wires, thread needles, or contrast agent (Lipiodol, Iopamidol) are introduced into or next to the lesion to ensure visibility on the angiogram after lung deflation. Then, the conventional part of VATS starts with the introduction of thoracoscopes. The imaging system is used in fluoroscopic mode now, where both the inserted instruments and the previously marked lesion are well visible. A precise resection is now possible. In case contrast agent has been used to mark the lesion, it will also drain into the regional lymph nodes, which then can be resected within the same procedure.|$|E

That is, visual and tactile sensors are the essential ones for both recognizing and handling any kind of object. For correct manipulation of objects it is necessary to know their spacial characteristics, as, for example, shape and position. Information on these characteristics of objects is picked up by human beings through visual and <b>tactile</b> <b>senses.</b> Before direct contact with the object, when the visual sense plays an exclusive role,decision (depending on the principal task) is based only on optical information. From the moment of touch, both optical and tactile information begin to be coordinated. At this moment the visual sense can be partly released for other tasks and the <b>tactile</b> <b>sense</b> may become dominant In picking up object information. It is clear that visual control usually has the dominant, but not absolute, role in the recognition and manipulation of objects. The system proposed here is a new kind of system wherein an obscure visual image can be identified as a clear Image by the coordination of visual and <b>tactile</b> <b>senses.</b> This system is quite effective when the object is cubic and inseparable from its circumstances, as in the case of the recognition and handling of objects in industrial use, underwater application, and so on...|$|R

The chapter is organized to sequentially provide the answers to above basic questions. <b>Tactile</b> <b>sensing</b> has often been considered as force sensing, which is not wholly true. In order to clarify such misconceptions about <b>tactile</b> <b>sensing,</b> it is defined in section 2. Why tactile section is important for robotics and what parameters are needed to be measured by tactile sensors to successfully perform various tasks, are discussed in section 3. An overview of `How <b>tactile</b> <b>sensing</b> has been achieved’ is given in section 4, where a number of technologies and transduction methods, that have been used to improve the <b>tactile</b> <b>sensing</b> capability of robotic devices, are discussed.
