5|$|As {{computers}} {{offered more}} advanced user interfaces, such as windows and point-and-click menus, many traditional roguelikes were modified to include support for having multiple windows. This was useful {{to not only}} show the character-based dungeon, but details on the character's inventory, the monster <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> battle with, and other status messages, in separate windows. Having access to multiple windows also allowed having menus to complete more complex commands.|$|E

5|$|Expert systems {{restricted}} {{themselves to}} a small domain of specific knowledge (thus avoiding the commonsense knowledge problem) and their simple design made it relatively easy for programs to be built and then modified once <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> place.

5|$|Financial markets on the {{continent}} {{are expected to be}} far more liquid and flexible than <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the past. The reduction in cross-border transaction costs will allow larger banking firms to provide a wider array of banking services that can compete across and beyond the eurozone. However, although transaction costs were reduced, some studies have shown that risk aversion has increased during the last 40 years in the Eurozone.|$|E

50|$|After {{a year of}} such training, The Game session changes, {{they have}} a {{different}} initial experience and although <b>they</b> <b>are</b> placed <b>in</b> the same world, it feels different. <b>They</b> discover <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not awakened if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> danger of hurting themselves. They first think this means they have gone to a new, higher level of The Game but start to realize <b>they</b> <b>are</b> never going to 'wake up' and that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> their new home forever. At first they believe <b>they</b> have <b>been</b> sent to another country, but they recognize this cannot <b>be</b> true when <b>they</b> realize they have never seen the moon, which is visible from everywhere on Earth. They stay up at night to look at the stars and the position of these makes them realize <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> a totally different part of the galaxy.|$|R
