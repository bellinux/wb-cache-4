25|$|The Portuguese Economy {{has been}} steady, {{expanding}} continuously since {{the third quarter}} of 2014, with a yearly GDP growth of 1.5% registered {{in the second quarter of}} 2015. The economy growth has been accompanied by a continuous fall in the unemployment rate (11.9% in the second quarter of 2015, compared with 13.9% registered in the end of 2014). The Government budget deficit has also been reduced from the 11.2% of GDP in 2010 to 4.8% in 2014. These rates mark an inversion from the negative trends caused by the impact of the Financial Crisis of 2008 in the Portuguese Economy, that made it to shrink for three consecutives years (2011, 2012 and 2013), accompanied by a high increase of the unemployment rate (that achieved a record of 17.7% in the early 2013). The crisis has caused a wide range of domestic problems that are specifically related to the levels of public deficit, as well as the excessive debt levels, in the economy, culminating in the confirmation from Portugal to a €78 billion financial bailout from the EU in April 2011, following similar decisions from Greece and Ireland. The government that assumed office in June 2011 had to face <b>tough</b> <b>choices</b> in regard to its attempts to stimulate the economy while at the same time seeking to maintain its public deficit around the EU average.|$|E
500|$|An {{analysis}} by the CBO showed that the Ryan plan would not balance the budget for at least 28 years, partly because the changes in Medicare would not affect anyone older than 55. Former U.S. Comptroller General David Walker and Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, praised the budget for making <b>tough</b> <b>choices.</b> Walker believed it needed to go even further, tackling Social Security and defense spending. In contrast, David Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan, has declared that Ryan's budget [...] "is devoid of credible math or hard policy choices" [...] and would [...] "do nothing to reverse the nation's economic decline and arrest its fiscal collapse". Ezra Klein also criticized the budget for making [...] "unrealistic assumptions". The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities was highly critical of Ryan's budget proposal, stating that it would shift income to the wealthy while increasing poverty and inequality.|$|E

2500|$|On June 28, 2012, Governor Brown {{signed a}} budget that made deep cuts to social {{services}} {{with the assumption that}} voters would pass $8 billion in tax hikes in November 2012 to close California's $15.7-billion budget deficit.

[...] Russell also pointed to 2006 comments by political scientist Soledad Loaeza, who noted, [...] "The eager candidate became a reluctant president who avoided <b>tough</b> <b>choices</b> and appeared hesitant and unable to hide the weariness caused by the responsibilities and constraints of the office." [...] Russell also asserted that Fox [...] "had little success in fighting crime. Even though he maintained the macroeconomic stability inherited from his predecessor, economic growth barely exceeded the rate of population increase. Similarly, the lack of fiscal reform left tax collection at a rate similar to that of Haiti [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Finally, Russell noted that [...] "during Fox's administration, only 1.4 million formal-sector jobs were created, leading to massive immigration to the United States and an explosive increase in informal employment."

2500|$|Within the Lifehold, BLADE discovers a pool {{of genetic}} {{material}} {{which can be used}} to recreate Earth lifeforms and restore humanity, and Elma explains that none of their human bodies are actually kept in stasis and were destroyed with Earth, but that their memories, and thus, their consciousnesses, are kept in the Lifehold's powerful computers, and {{that it is possible to}} transfer their consciousnesses into their new bodies. As the ethics are highly questionable, this decision was made through the <b>tough</b> <b>choices</b> of their superiors. Luxaar attacks, but Lao fatally stabs him. Luxaar then accidentally merges with Lao in the genetic material, with BLADE being forced to kill their merged form. Before dying, Lao reveals that humanity's DNA was designed by their Samaarian ancestors to destroy the Ganglion using an in-built genetic failsafe. Though Lao dies, Elma assures the group that he can be revived using the Lifehold. With the Lifehold online and power restored, Elma deactivates her Mimeosome and reveals her true form as an alien. A narration by Lin reveals that Elma visited Earth thirty years before the aliens arrived, giving humanity the means of escaping. In a post-credits scene, a team led by Elma enter the Lifehold to find that the databases containing the memories of everyone else have been destroyed since the White Whale crashed on Mira. As everyone else should have died when the databases were destroyed, Elma speculates that somehow, Mira is preserving them.
