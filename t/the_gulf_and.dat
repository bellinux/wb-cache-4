5|$|It is the {{combination}} of warm humid air from <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>and</b> dry air from the deserts of the Southwest that produce deadly storms. These conditions create an unstable severe storm creating arena. Although tornadoes occur on every continent except Antarctica they are especially common in North America, specifically the United States.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the past}} two centuries, {{tropical}} cyclones {{have been responsible for}} the deaths of about 1.9 million people worldwide. Large areas of standing water caused by flooding lead to infection, as well as contributing to mosquito-borne illnesses. Crowded evacuees in shelters increase the risk of disease propagation. Tropical cyclones significantly interrupt infrastructure, leading to power outages, bridge destruction, and the hampering of reconstruction efforts. On average, <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>and</b> east coasts of the United States suffer approximately US $5 billion (1995 US $) in cyclone damage every year. The majority (83%) of tropical cyclone damage is caused by severe hurricanes, category 3 or greater. However, category 3 or greater hurricanes only account for about one-fifth of cyclones that make landfall every year.|$|E
5|$|The American white ibis (Eudocimus albus) is {{a species}} of bird in the ibis family, Threskiornithidae. It is found from Virginia via the Gulf Coast of the United States south {{through most of the}} coastal New World tropics. This {{particular}} ibis is a medium-sized bird with an overall white plumage, bright red-orange down-curved bill and long legs, and black wing tips that are usually only visible in flight. Males are larger and have longer bills than females. The breeding range runs along <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>and</b> Atlantic Coast, and the coasts of Mexico and Central America. Outside the breeding period, the range extends further inland in North America and also includes the Caribbean. It is also found along the northwestern South American coastline in Colombia and Venezuela. Populations in central Venezuela overlap and interbreed with the scarlet ibis. The two have been classified by some authorities as a single species.|$|E

5|$|The steamer put to sea on 19 November with {{ordnance}} {{stores for}} Fort Pickens, Florida, and {{vessels in the}} Gulf of Mexico, arriving off Southwest Pass, Mississippi River, after 11 December. Joining the Gulf Blockading Squadron at that time, De Soto patrolled for Confederate blockade runners near Barataria Bay. Given the sometimes light winds of <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>and</b> inshore waters, the vessel's shallow draft and steam power gave De Soto an advantage over her mainly sail-powered prey. Cmdr. Walker's first month in the region began poorly, however, when his ship collided with the French war steamer Milan, then adrift off South West Pass, Mississippi River. Although damage to De Soto was slight, the Milan was disabled and thus needed a tow into the Union anchorage.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Three {{formed on}} July 3 in the Caribbean Sea, {{but the next}} day, before being able to strengthen, it moved over the Yucatán Peninsula. The system emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on July 4 at which point a new center of {{circulation}} developed at {{the northern edge of}} the system and the system strengthened to a tropical storm, becoming Tropical Storm Cindy early July 4. The storm moved rapidly across <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>and</b> made landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana late July 5 as a minimal hurricane; though it was originally thought to have been only a tropical storm at landfall, it was upgraded to a hurricane in the post-storm analysis. As most storms do, it weakened while over land and became extratropical over the Carolinas on July 7.|$|E

25|$|The Navy's {{operational}} {{forces are}} organized as two independent groups: the Gulf Force and the Pacific (West) Force.

Both are subdivided into regions, with Regions 1, 3, and 5 on <b>the</b> <b>Gulf,</b> <b>and</b> 2, 4, and 6 on the Pacific. Each region is further divided into sectors and zones, so a proliferation of headquarters and senior officers exists. The Navy also has an air arm with troop transport, reconnaissance, and surveillance aircraft.|$|E
