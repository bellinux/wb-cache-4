5|$|Schirra began {{training}} for the mission in early July, logging 29hours in simulators as well as 31hours in the spacecraft itself. This included multiple systems tests and three simulated flights, culminating in a six-and-a-half-hour simulated flight on September 29, with the spacecraft and booster fully stacked on the pad.

5|$|Gregarious German {{cockroaches}} show different behavior when {{reared in}} isolation from when reared in a group. In one study, isolated cockroaches {{were less likely to}} leave their shelters and explore, spent less time eating, interacted less with conspecifics when exposed to them, and took longer to recognize receptive females. Because these changes occurred in many contexts, the authors suggested them as constituting a behavioral syndrome. These effects might have been due either to reduced metabolic and developmental rates in isolated individuals or the fact that the isolated individuals hadn't had a <b>training</b> <b>period</b> to learn about what others were like via their antennae.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the <b>training</b> <b>period</b> was for six weeks; {{later it}} was changed to eight weeks. General in scope, the program was {{designed}} to give cadets an overall view of the USCG. Academic study included: administration, correspondence, communications, history, organization, personnel, public speaking, ships, and special lectures and visual aids. The regimental part of the training was designed to help cadets adjust to military life, and to acquaint them with their responsibilities as officers. The cadets {{ranged in age from}} 20 to 40, with diverse civilian backgrounds from teachers and journalists to lawyers and technicians.|$|E

5|$|The Special Air Service (SAS) {{commando}} {{unit was}} formed by the British Army in 1941, during the North African Campaign of the Second World War. Including some Southern Rhodesians in its ranks, it served {{for the rest of}} the conflict, also operating in Italy and on the European Western Front. It was disbanded by the British government in October 1945, and reinstituted in 1950 to serve in the Korean War. The situation in Korea had changed by the end of its three-month <b>training</b> <b>period,</b> however, and it was sent to Malaya instead.

5|$|After sea trials, Tirpitz was {{stationed}} in Kiel and performed intensive training in the Baltic. While the ship was in Kiel, Germany invaded the Soviet Union. A temporary Baltic Fleet was created to prevent the possible break-out of the Soviet fleet based in Leningrad. Tirpitz was briefly made the flagship of the squadron, which consisted of the heavy cruiser , the light cruisers , , , and , several destroyers, and two flotillas of minesweepers. The Baltic Fleet, {{under the command of}} Vice Admiral Otto Ciliax, patrolled off the Aaland Islands from 23 to 26 September 1941, after which the unit was disbanded and Tirpitz resumed training. During the <b>training</b> <b>period,</b> Tirpitz tested her primary and secondary guns on the old pre-dreadnought battleship , which had been converted into a radio-controlled target ship. The British Royal Air Force (RAF) continued to launch unsuccessful bombing raids on Tirpitz while she {{was stationed}} in Kiel.|$|E

5|$|In late 1942, {{recruiting}} requirements {{were such}} that both enlisted and officer candidates {{had to be}} American citizens; have no children under 18 years of age; present three character references; pass a physical examination; and submit a record of occupation after leaving school. Enlisted applicants were also required to have completed {{at least two years}} of high school and be between the ages of 20 and 36 years. Officer candidates were expected to be college graduates, or to have completed two years of college, and have at least two years of acceptable business or professional experience, and be between the ages of 20 and 50 years. Certain regulations with respect to marriage applied to both enlisted and officer candidates. Married women could enlist provided their husbands were not in the USCG. Unmarried women had to agree not to marry until they had finished their <b>training</b> <b>period.</b> After training, they could marry a civilian or service man who was not in the USCG.|$|E
5|$|The 11th Battalion was an Australian Army {{battalion}} {{that was}} among the first infantry units raised during World War I for the First Australian Imperial Force. It was the first battalion recruited in Western Australia, and following a brief <b>training</b> <b>period</b> in Perth, the battalion sailed to Egypt where it undertook four months of intensive training. In April 1915 it took part in the invasion of the Gallipoli Peninsula, landing at Anzac Cove. In August 1915 the battalion was in action in the Battle of Lone Pine. Following the withdrawal from Gallipoli, the battalion returned to Egypt where it was split to help form the 51st Battalion. In March 1916, the battalion was deployed to the Western Front in France and Belgium where it took part in trench warfare {{until the end of the}} war in November 1918.|$|E
5|$|The peacetime {{organisation}} of the KJRM remained essentially unchanged from 1929 {{until the}} invasion of Yugoslavia. The Naval Command in Zemun formed part of the Ministry of Army and Navy, and controlled Navy Headquarters. Navy Headquarters consisted of the staff, archives, main naval radio station and the navy newspaper, and controlled six branches; the fleet, River and Lake Forces, Maritime Air Force, Coastal Defence Command, Naval Surveillance Command, and shore establishments. The exact composition of the fleet varied considerably as vessels were added and disposed of, but from 1938 it usually comprised three torpedo divisions, a submarine division and a training squadron, reaching its maximum strength during the summer <b>training</b> <b>period</b> each year. The minelayers were usually part of the Coastal Defence Command, but were detached to the fleet during naval exercises, as were naval aviation squadrons. The Maritime Air Force consisted of three seaplane commands each of two groups, the naval aviation school and the seaplane depot ship Zmaj.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{observers}} {{present for}} the exercise {{reported that they had}} been impressed with the performance of the glider-borne elements of the division. However, several noted that the training of the aircraft pilots for night formation flying and navigation was far from satisfactory. A recommendation was made that night that glider landings should be considered only when an emergency existed, and that otherwise gliders should take off during the night and land during daylight to avoid the wide dispersal of airborne troops and a decrease in efficiency. After these exercises had ended, the division continued to train, but encountered further delays. These were caused when 1,652 men were removed from the division to provide reinforcements for U.S. Airborne units in the European Theater; this drastically reduced the strength of the division and forced it to extend its <b>training</b> <b>period</b> for a further four months. After completing its training in January the division was preparing to transfer to the Pacific Theatre in early 1945. However, the rapid advances made by German forces during the Battle of the Bulge led to the division being transferred to the European Theatre of Operations to reinforce Allied divisions already in combat.|$|E

40|$|Positive reinforcement, {{physical}} guidance, and fading {{procedures were}} used to teach two severely retarded children motor responses {{to a variety of}} verbal instructions. Subjects' responses to one set of instructions provided the focus for the training procedures.

The frequency of responses to both sets of instructions was evaluated during Baseline 1, Training 1, Baseline 2, and <b>Training</b> 2 <b>periods.</b> During the <b>training</b> <b>periods,</b> this evaluation was made after the daily training sessions when no training procedures were in effect. Results indicated that the subjects showed pronounced increases in instruction-following behaviors (both trained and untrained) during <b>training</b> <b>periods</b> with decreases in such behavior occurring during the Baseline 2 period. The general findings demonstrate the applicability of the training procedures for producing and maintaining instruction-following behaviors in severely retarded children and for facilitating appropriate responding to instructions not directly involved in training...|$|R
