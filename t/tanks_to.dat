50|$|Tanks must {{be cleaned}} {{from time to}} time for various reasons. One reason is to change the type of product carried inside a <b>tank</b> <b>to</b> prevent cross contamination. Another is <b>to</b> allow the <b>tank</b> <b>to</b> be {{inspected}} or for maintenance to be performed within a <b>tank</b> and <b>to</b> prevent product build-up on tank interior walls.|$|R

5|$|Amir's brigade was {{now down}} to one {{battalion}}, which was to attack with Nir's brigade of 50 <b>tanks.</b> <b>To</b> Amir's surprise, a reserve armored battalion of 25 tanks commanded by Colonel Eliashiv Shemshi arrived in the area, en route to Keren's brigade. Short of forces, Amir, with Adan's approval, commandeered Shemshi's battalion, and ordered him to provide covering fire for Nir's assault on the Firdan bridge.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 11 {{landed with}} less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts {{encountered}} a premature low fuel warning. This was later {{found to be}} the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the <b>tanks</b> <b>to</b> prevent this.|$|E
50|$|A vacuum {{operated}} {{fuel pump}} {{is mounted on}} the bottom of the fuel <b>tank,</b> <b>to</b> lift the contents of the <b>tank</b> <b>to</b> the twin carburettors.The fuel system incorporates one slide carb and one butterfly carb.

5|$|In 1979, due {{to issues}} {{caused by the}} transmission, the French Army began to {{modernize}} its fleet of <b>tanks</b> <b>to</b> AMX-30B2 standards, which included a new transmission, an improved engine {{and the introduction of}} a new fin-stabilized kinetic energy penetrator. Production of the AMX-30 also extended to a number of variants, including the AMX-30D armored recovery vehicle, the AMX-30R anti-aircraft gun system, a bridge-layer, the Pluton tactical nuclear missile launcher and a surface-to-air missile launcher.|$|E
5|$|The 48th Panzer Corps {{had fewer}} than 100 {{serviceable}} modern <b>tanks</b> <b>to</b> combat Soviet armor. Furthermore, they lacked fuel, and {{the shortage of}} tanks forced commanders to organize tank crews into infantry companies; the 22nd Panzer Division, which formed part of the corps, was almost completely destroyed in the fighting that ensued. The 22nd had entered the fighting with fewer than thirty working tanks, and left with a company of tanks. The Romanian 1st Armored Division, attached to the 48th Panzer Corps, engaged the Soviet 26th Tank Corps after having lost communications with their German corps commanders, and were defeated by 20 November. As the Soviets continued to advance southwards, many Soviet tank crews began to suffer from the worsening blizzard, which affected men and equipment, and blocked gunsights. It was not uncommon for <b>tanks</b> <b>to</b> lose traction on the ground, and for a crew member to have an arm broken as he was thrown around inside the hull. However, the blizzard also neutralized the German corps' coordination.|$|E
5|$|The Dornier had {{self-sealing}} fuel <b>tanks</b> <b>to</b> protect fuel {{stored in}} the wings and fuselage. This reduced the loss of fuel and risk of fire when hit in action, and often enabled the aircraft to return. Twenty oxygen bottles were provided for crew use during long flights above 3,660 m (12,000ft).|$|E

If the tank is not found to be cleaned well enough, a troublesome area can be given additional cleansing attention.|$|R

5|$|The Panzer IV was {{the most}} {{exported}} German tank of the Second World War. In 1942, Germany delivered 11 <b>tanks</b> <b>to</b> Romania and 32 to Hungary, {{many of which were}} lost on the Eastern Front between the final months of 1942 and the beginning of 1943 during the battles around Stalingrad. Romania received approximately 120 Panzer IV tanks of different models throughout the entire war. To arm Bulgaria, Germany supplied 46 or 91 Panzer IVs, and offered Italy 12 <b>tanks</b> <b>to</b> form the nucleus of a new armored division. These were used to train Italian crews while the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was deposed, but were retaken by Germany during its occupation of Italy in mid-1943. The Spanish government petitioned for 100 Panzer IVs in March 1943, but only 20 were ever delivered, by December. Finland bought 30, but only received 15 in 1944, and the same year a second batch of 62 or 72 was sent to Hungary (although 20 of these were diverted to replace German losses). In total, 297 Panzer IVs of all models were delivered to Germany's allies.|$|E
5|$|A {{batch of}} 10 were {{produced}} and five were built from existing H-6s. The machines {{were joined by}} a center wing formed by two sections 6.15m (20ft) in length. The powerplants were five Junkers Jumo 211F engines producing 1,000kW (1,340hp) each. The total fuel capacity was 8,570L (2,260US gal). This was increased by adding of four 600L (160US gal) drop tanks. The He111Z could tow a Gotha Go 242 glider or Me 321 for up to 10 hours at cruising speed. It could also remain airborne if the three central powerplants failed. The He 111Z-2 and Z-3 were also planned as heavy bombers carrying 1,800kg (3,970lb) of bombs and having a range of 4,000km (2,500mi). The ETC installations allowed for a further four 600L (160US gal) drop <b>tanks</b> <b>to</b> be installed.|$|E
5|$|A letter Hess {{wrote to}} his wife dated 4 November 1940 shows {{that in spite of}} not {{receiving}} a reply from Hamilton, he intended to proceed with his plan. He began training on the Messerschmitt Bf 110, a two-seater twin-engine aircraft, in October 1940 under instructor Wilhelm Stör, the chief test pilot at Messerschmitt. He continued to practice, including logging many cross-country flights, and found a specific aircraft that handled well—a Bf 110E-1/N—which was from then on held in reserve for his personal use. He asked for a radio compass, modifications to the oxygen delivery system, and large long-range fuel <b>tanks</b> <b>to</b> be installed on this plane, and these requests were granted by March 1941.|$|E

5|$|Although the PanzerI would {{participate}} {{in almost every}} major Nationalist offensive of the war, the Nationalist army began to deploy more and more captured T-26 <b>tanks</b> <b>to</b> offset their disadvantage in protection and firepower. At one point, von Thoma offered up to 500pesetas for each T-26 captured. Although the Panzer I was initially able to knock out the T-26 at close range—150meters (165yd) or less—using an armor-piercing 7.92millimeter bullet, the Republican tanks began to engage at ranges where they were immune to the machine guns of the PanzerI.|$|E
5|$|At 07:53, {{minutes before}} the Israeli attack was to commence, Israeli forces near El-Qantarah became heavily engaged with a brigade {{composing}} the 18th Division's right flank, as Egyptian troops sought to secure the town and its vicinity. Fuad, the division commander supported the brigade with two companies of T-62 <b>tanks.</b> <b>To</b> prevent Israeli forces in the area from being outflanked, Gonen ordered Nir to remain near El-Qantarah to help contain the Egyptian attack. This left Adan with only 50 tanks under Amir's command {{to carry out the}} attack.|$|E
5|$|Because of Monitors {{advanced}} state of deterioration, timely recovery of remaining significant artifacts and ship components became critical. Numerous fragile artifacts, including the innovative turret and its two Dahlgren guns, an anchor, steam engine, and propeller, have been recovered. They were transported back to Hampton Roads to the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Virginia, {{where they were}} treated in special <b>tanks</b> <b>to</b> stabilize the metal. It is reported {{that it will take}} about ten years for the metal to completely stabilize. The new USS Monitor Center at the Mariners' Museum officially opened on March 9, 2007, and a full-scale copy of USS Monitor, the original recovered turret, and artifacts and related items are now on display.|$|E

5|$|Because of the ship's high profile, {{there were}} {{concerns}} about her stability {{in bad weather}} as she had {{a significant amount of}} weight mounted high in the ship; notably her catapults, cranes and anti-aircraft guns. To increase her stability, two lateral tanks were fitted with a pressurized butterfly valve connecting them so that water could flow between the <b>tanks</b> <b>to</b> counter her rolling motion. On trials in 1933, the system was judged successful as it deadened the ship's roll by 37-65%. However, maintenance of the system proved to be problematic as the tanks were difficult to access.|$|E
5|$|C Squadron, {{leading a}} brigade group, {{advanced}} towards Gambut {{on the morning}} of 23 November. On the outskirts of Gambut, the line was stopped to allow the Matilda <b>tanks</b> <b>to</b> lead the column. C Squadron was ordered to charge into Gambut, but when it became apparent that the Axis was retreating, they pursued until the New Zealand infantry engaged and then withdrew to Gambut aerodrome. The following evening, the squadron screened the 4th Brigade Group and advanced westward before being recalled at dusk. On 25 November, C Squadron screened the brigade in its advance on Sidi Rezegh and captured a number of German soldiers before being sent to guard divisional headquarters. Four Stuart tanks, captured from the British by the Germans and then recaptured, were given to C Squadron on the afternoon of 27 November.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Nghia {{showed his}} mixed {{feelings}} about the junta with the selective use of his armored troops. They supported Khánh's move against Dinh, Don, Kim and Xuan, but tried to protect Minh by using <b>tanks</b> <b>to</b> shield Minh's house from Lam's Civil Guard units, which were also used to arrest the four other leading junta members. Although Minh was taken away, this was {{claimed to be a}} protective measure to shield him from some of Khánh's more hawkish supporters, and he was never formally arrested and taken into detention. Throughout the morning the deposed officers were taken one by one to JGS headquarters by the plotters. The generals were then flown to My Khe beach, near Da Nang.|$|E
