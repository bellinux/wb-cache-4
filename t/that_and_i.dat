[...] {{had been}} {{developed}} long before the band began recording tracks for their fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, and was not getting into completion. Champion recalls, [...] "I {{was starting to get}} into using a particular drum programming programme. I was messing around with <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> built this beat up from scratch.... Then Chris overheard it and played 'Lost!' over the top of it." [...] Martin revealed that the song's drumbeat took inspiration from Justin Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River", which was one of Champion's favourite songs at that time.|$|E
500|$|In March 1967, while {{awaiting}} {{the consequences of}} the police raid, Jagger, Richards and Jones took a short trip to Morocco, accompanied by Marianne Faithfull, Jones' girlfriend Anita Pallenberg and other friends. During this trip the stormy relations between Jones and Pallenberg deteriorated to the point that Pallenberg left Morocco with Richards. Richards said later: [...] "That was the final nail in the coffin with me and Brian. He'd never forgive me for <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't blame him, but hell, shit happens." [...] Richards and Pallenberg would remain a couple for twelve years. Despite these complications, the Rolling Stones toured Europe in March and April 1967. The tour included the band's first performances in Poland, Greece, and Italy.|$|E

Comic book fans reacted negatively over the Joker murdering Thomas and Martha Wayne; in the comic book, Joe Chill is responsible. Writer Sam Hamm said it was Burton's idea to have the Joker murder Wayne's parents. [...] "The Writer's Strike was going on, and Tim had the other writers do that.

[...] Lear {{came up with the idea}} on a trip to Washington, D.C.: [...] "I had visited the Institute of Policy Studies, and I just loved the whole thing.

Only the people themselves can do <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hope that the spirit of ‘esprit de corps’ will prevail and this will be a model estate" [...] Demand was highthere were 427 applicants for the first twenty eight houses builtand the council built further tracts of housing in a broad triangle between Sodhouse Bank, Ermine Crescent and The Avenue, although central government withdrew its promised funding. By 1936, most of the social housing available as of 2012 was in existence and provides accommodation to over half {{of the population of the}} suburb.|$|E

The player himself also {{disagreed}} with the decision: [...] "The umpire said I struck him but I just saw the man coming towards me and {{it was more a}} case of getting myself out of the way or protecting myself." [...] He added: [...] "I'd never been sent off for Armagh before and to be sent off in an All-Ireland final is hard to take. Hopefully I won't be remembered for <b>that.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't like to end the career on that note." [...] Kernan and Marsden contested the decision and subsequent ban, but the GAA's Games Administration Committee upheld the penalty. However, after taking their case to the Central Council, the ban was overturned.|$|E

500|$|Nazi pledges of nondiscrimination {{in sports}} proved {{inconsistent}} with their actions, {{such as the}} expulsion of Jews from sports clubs, and in September 1934, Brundage sailed for Germany to see for himself. He met with government officials and others, although he {{was not allowed to}} meet with Jewish sports leaders alone. When he returned, he reported, [...] "I was given positive assurance in writing... {{that there will be no}} discrimination against Jews.

[...] Brundage's trip only increased the controversy over the question of US participation, with New York Congressman Emanuel Celler stating that Brundage [...] "had prejudged the situation before he sailed from America".

500|$|The {{overtaking}} manoeuvres made by Coulthard on Michael Schumacher {{received much}} media attention after the race. Coulthard accused Michael Schumacher of unsporting behaviour and dangerous driving, saying: [...] "I had a clean run at Michael {{on the outside}} and equally I felt he drove me wide. You could say he had the right to do that because he had the track position, but I think it was a deliberate gesture in trying to run someone wide like <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was very angry." [...] Michael Schumacher later denied any wrongdoing and citied a similar incident at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix where Coulthard pushed him wide although no objections were made. He also admitted that he did not see Coulthard's hand gesture. Coulthard sought clarification with the FIA over such overtakes with a source from Formula One's governing body noting: [...] "It was hard racing -- they are racing drivers aren't they?" [...] GrandPrix.com said that Coulthard's overtake meant that [...] "He is ready to stand up to Michael and he is not afraid of what will happen if Michael does not lift." ...|$|E

Upon making inquiries at the Federation of Disability Sport Wales (FDSW), he was introduced to carbon-fibre running [...] "blades". He graduated from university with an upper second-class honours degree in summer 2004, taking part in his first race at the Disability Sports Events (DSE) Championships in the UK the same year.|$|E
