5|$|After {{returning}} to London from Wallsend, {{he attended a}} full meeting of Labour MPs to decide who would become the Party Chairman. This effectively meant choosing the leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, because Labour was the largest opposition party in the House of Commons. The two candidates were Ramsay MacDonald and J. R. Clynes, and Hastings, who supported MacDonald, persuaded six new MPs <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>him.</b> MacDonald was elected {{by a margin of}} only five votes, and Hastings later regretted his support.|$|E
5|$|Benbow's {{fame and}} success earned him both public notoriety and a {{promotion}} to admiral. He was then {{involved in an}} incident during the Action of August 1702, where {{a number of his}} captains refused <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>him</b> while commanding a squadron of ships. Benbow instigated the trial and later imprisonment or execution of a number of the captains involved, though he did not live to see these results. These events contributed to his notoriety, and led to several references to him in subsequent popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Matthew III Csák, whom Andrew {{had made}} palatine in 1296, turned against Andrew {{at the end}} of 1297. Andrew's staunch supporter, Archbishop Lodomer, died around the same time. In early February 1298, Andrew visited Albert of Austria in Vienna and promised <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>him</b> against Adolf of Nassau, King of Germany. Andrew sent an {{auxiliary}} troop, and Albert of Austria routed King Adolf in the Battle of Göllheim on 2July.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{learning}} that the Prussian army was able <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>him,</b> Wellington decided to offer battle on the Mont-Saint-Jean escarpment, across the Brussels road. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon, {{aided by the}} progressively arriving Prussians. In the evening Napoleon committed his last reserves to a desperate final attack, which was narrowly beaten back. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, Wellington's Anglo-allied army counter-attacked in the centre, and the French army was routed.|$|E
5|$|After a {{full day}} of pursuit, the leading French ships made an attempt to cut off , {{trailing}} in the British rear. Cornwallis dropped back to support Mars, while Captain Robert Stopford of HMS Phaeton began making signals implying a British fleet was in sight. When French lookouts spotted distant topsails, Villaret de Joyeuse decided that Cornwallis's actions meant that a British fleet was approaching <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>him,</b> and called off the pursuit. There was no British fleet in the vicinity; the topsails were those of a convoy of British merchantmen.|$|E
5|$|Arana's support {{began to}} be {{solicited}} by the landed elite, who felt threatened by Arévalo's reforms. Arana, who was not initially inclined {{to get involved with}} politics, began to make occasional statements against the government. In the 1948 parliamentary election, he backed a number of opposition candidates, all of whom were defeated. By 1949 the National Renovation Party and the PAR were both openly hostile to Arana, while a small fragment of the Popular Liberation Front split off <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>him.</b> The leftist parties decided to back Árbenz instead, as they believed that only a military officer could defeat Arana.|$|E
50|$|According to the Public Citizen, a non-profit, {{consumer}} rights advocacy group, William H. Orrick III, who was {{employed by the}} law firm Coblentz Patch Duffy & Bass, raised at least $200,000 for Barack Obama and donated $30,800 <b>to</b> committees <b>supporting</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{financial}} trouble, the Valley Times {{became involved}} with the mob itself. According to a 1979 expose by the Reno Evening Gazette, Brown switched the papers editorial position in 1976 from criticizing the state government for not being hard enough on Rosenthal <b>to</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>him.</b> From 1976 <b>to</b> 1977, the Valley Times received $368,000 from ad man Jerry May for fake ads that never ran. Brown kept 10% for the Times, passing the rest back to May who funnelled {{the money to the}} mob in Chicago. May was convicted of money laundering in 1984 for his involvement in the scheme.|$|R

5|$|Colonel Harvey's {{account of}} the smoke-filled room had Harding being sent for {{in the early morning}} hours, to be {{informed}} by Harvey that the Ohioan would be the candidate. Harvey stated he asked if there was anything in Harding's background that might harm his candidacy, to which the senator, who had had at least one extramarital affair, replied there was not. Harding biographer Charles W. Murray noted that there is no evidence besides Harvey's word that Harding went to the Hays suite that night, and that other participants denied that Harding was there. Harding was so uncertain of victory that he filed for re-election to the Senate, though Daugherty continued to urge delegates <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Edgardo found {{shelter in}} a convent of the Canons Regular in Austria, {{where he lived}} under an assumed name. In 1872 he moved to a monastery at Poitiers in France, where Pope Pius {{regularly}} corresponded with the bishop about the young man. After a year, Pio Edgardo Mortara was ordained as a priest—with special dispensation as at 21 he was technically too young. He received a personal letter from the Pope to mark the occasion, {{as well as a}} lifetime trust fund of 7,000 lire <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of his mentor Cai E (November 1916) and of his first wife, Zhu {{developed}} a severe opium habit that afflicted him until 1922, when he underwent treatment in Shanghai. His troops continued <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>him,</b> and so he consolidated his forces to become a warlord. In 1920, after his troops were driven from Sichuan toward the Tibetan border, he returned to Yunnan as a public security commissioner of the provincial government. Around this time he decided to leave China for study in Europe. He first traveled to Shanghai, where he broke his opium habit and, according to historians of the Kuomintang, met Dr. Sun Yat-sen. He attempted to join the Chinese Communist Party in early 1922, but was rejected due to his being a warlord.|$|E
25|$|The 1929 treaty {{included}} a legal provision whereby the Italian government would protect the honor and {{dignity of the}} Pope by prosecuting offenders.

5|$|Gandhi {{came from}} a poor family, and he {{had dropped out of}} the {{cheapest}} college he could afford. Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London. In July 1888, his wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving son, Harilal. His mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family, and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew. Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol and women. Gandhi's brother Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>him.</b> Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing.|$|E
5|$|Halo.bungie.org {{has used}} its notability to conduct several fundraisers for various causes, {{including}} raising money for Hurricane Katrina disaster relief. The site's members {{took part in a}} massive effort by the Halo community to raise money, primarily through selling collectible items through eBay auctions. These auctions raised just under $11,000 for the relief effort. Members of the community also chipped in through personal means; one member held a charity Xbox live night and raised $139. In 2003, following news that community member Brian Morden's cancer had returned, the community decided to set up a donation fund <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>him.</b> Although Brian died later that year, the fund became the Brian Morden Memorial Fund.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, {{after he}} unsuccessfully {{applied for a}} job with Canada's National Research Council, the University of Chicago {{accepted}} him as a research associate. There, Slotin gained his first experience with nuclear chemistry, helping to build the first cyclotron in the midwestern United States. The job paid poorly and Slotin's father had <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>him</b> for two years. From 1939 to 1940, Slotin collaborated with Earl Evans, {{the head of the}} university's biochemistry department, to produce radiocarbon (carbon-14 and carbon-11) from the cyclotron. While working together, the two men also used carbon-11 to demonstrate that plant cells had the capacity to use carbon dioxide for carbohydrate synthesis, through carbon fixation.|$|E

5|$|In March 1982 Massino was {{tipped off}} by a Colombo-associated FBI insider {{that he was about}} to be indicted and went into hiding in Pennsylvania with Leisenheimer. On March 25, 1982, Massino was also charged with {{conspiracy}} to murder Indelicato, Giaccone and Trinchera and truck hijacking. In hiding, Massino was able to see the prosecution's strategy and better plan his defense as well as eventually face trial without association with other mobsters. Pistone later speculated Massino also feared retaliation upon the revelation that his associate Raymond Wean had turned state's evidence. Massino was visited by many fellow mobsters, including Gotti, and Vitale would secretly deliver cash <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Maria died {{shortly after}} giving birth to their daughter, Isabella, in late 1212. Her death {{triggered}} a legal dispute, with John of Ibelin (who administered Jerusalem before John's coronation) questioning the widowed king's right to rule. The king sent Raoul of Merencourt, Bishop of Sidon, to Rome for assistance from the Holy See. Pope Innocent confirmed John as lawful ruler of the Holy Land in early 1213, urging the prelates <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>him</b> with ecclesiastical sanctions if needed. Most of the Jerusalemite lords remained loyal to the king, acknowledging his right to administer the kingdom {{on behalf of his}} infant daughter; John of Ibelin left the Holy Land and settled in Cyprus.|$|E
5|$|Pope John XXII, {{elected in}} 1316, sought Edward's {{support for a}} new crusade, and was also {{inclined}} <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>him</b> politically. In 1317, in exchange for papal support in his war with Scotland, Edward agreed to recommence paying the annual Papal tribute, which had been first agreed by King John in 1213; Edward soon ceased the payments, however, and the King never offered his homage, {{another part of the}} 1213 agreement. In 1325 Edward asked Pope John to instruct the Irish Church to openly preach in favour of his right to rule the island, and to threaten to excommunicate any contrary voices.|$|E

5|$|Ramarayaningar {{was made}} a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire on 5 June 1926. In the Assembly {{elections}} which took place on 8 November 1926, no party {{was able to get}} a clean majority. The Swarajya Party won 41 of the 98 seats and emerged as the single largest party while the Justice party won 21. The Raja resigned as the Chief Minister of the Presidency as the popular verdict appeared to be against the Justice Party. As no party had a clean majority and the Swarajya Party which was the single largest party in the assembly was reluctant to form the government, the Governor appointed P. Subbarayan as the independent Chief Minister and nominated 34 members to the Council <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rocky Balboa, now {{sixty years}} old and retired from boxing, lives a quiet life as a widower, Adrian having died from cancer several years prior. He now runs a small but {{successful}} Italian restaurant named after her, where he regales his patrons with stories of his past. He also battles personal demons, involving his grief over Adrian's death, the changing times, and his eroding relationship with his son Robert, who has moved out to become a struggling corporate employee. Paulie, Rocky's brother-in-law and longtime best friend, continues <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>him</b> whenever he can, but is constantly riddled with guilt over his poor treatment towards his late sister.|$|E
5|$|Suffolk did {{not receive}} major grants from Edward IV either, {{although}} de la Pole continued <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>him</b> in arms when necessary, and when Edward lost his throne in 1470, Suffolk was not trusted by the new Lancastrian regime. Suffolk fought for Edward at the battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury but did not join Edward's inner circle during his second reign. He seems to have acquiesced in the usurpation of Richard III in 1483, but, unlike his son, was not present for Richard III's defeat at the Battle of Bosworth two years later. Henry VII {{does not seem to}} have held Suffolk's son's treason against the duke, and even seems to have protected him from the former's attainder. John de la Pole died in 1492 and was buried at Wingfield Church, Suffolk.|$|E
