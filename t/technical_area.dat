5|$|For many years, Bradbury was {{responsible}} {{for much of the}} administration of the town of Los Alamos. The town established impressive health and education facilities. Eventually the new <b>technical</b> <b>area</b> was built outside the town, and on 18 February 1957 the security gates were taken down. Finally, the town became an incorporated community and the director's civic responsibilities ended.|$|E
5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the {{scientific}} panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like others at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the <b>technical</b> <b>area.</b> Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.|$|E
5|$|Built in 2000, {{the main}} Trinity Road Stand {{is the most}} {{recently}} completed at Villa Park and houses the dressing rooms, club offices and director's boxes. The stand is composed of three tiers with a row of executive boxes between {{the second and third}} tiers. Although much larger than the other stands, the stand has roughly the same roof level as the other three sides. The players' tunnel and the <b>technical</b> <b>area</b> where the managers and substitutes sit during the match {{are in the middle of}} the stand at pitch level. The press and the directors' VIP area are situated in the centre of the middle tier. The upper tiers of the stand extend over Trinity Road, the street that cuts behind the ground. Trinity Road passes through a tunnel formed by the Trinity Road Stand.|$|E

5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory had a {{governing}} board, {{the members of}} which were Oppenheimer, Bacher, Bethe, Kennedy, D. L. Hughes (Personnel Director), D. P. Mitchell (Procurement Director) and Deak Parsons. McMillan, George Kistiakowsky and Kenneth Bainbridge were later added. The laboratory was organized into five divisions: Administration (A), Theoretical (T) under Bethe, Experimental Physics (P) under Bacher, Chemistry and Metallurgy (CM) under Kennedy, and Ordnance and Engineering (E) under Parsons. All the divisions expanded during 1943 and 1944, but T Division, despite trebling in size, remained the smallest, while E Division grew to be the largest. Security clearance was a problem. Scientists (including, at first, Oppenheimer) had to be given access to the <b>Technical</b> <b>Area</b> without proper clearance. In the interest of efficiency, Groves approved an abbreviated process by which Oppenheimer vouched for senior scientists, and three other employees were sufficient to vouch for a junior scientist or technician.|$|E
5|$|Women at Los Alamos were {{encouraged}} to work, due to the shortage of labor and security concerns over bringing in local workers. About 60 wives of scientists were at work in <b>Technical</b> <b>Area</b> by September 1943. About 200 of the 670 workers in the laboratory, hospital and school were women in October 1944. Most worked in administration, but many women such as Lilli Hornig, Jane Hamilton Hall, and Peggy Titterton worked as scientists and technicians. Charlotte Serber headed the A-5 (Library) Group. A large group of women worked on numerical calculations in the T-5 (Computations) Group. Dorothy McKibbin ran the Santa Fe office, which opened at 109 East Palace Avenue on 27 March 1943.|$|E

25|$|Twenty20 match {{format is}} a form of limited overs cricket in that it {{involves}} two teams, each with a single innings, the key feature being that each team bats for a maximum of 20 overs.

25|$|Wormingford was {{originally}} earmarked for an Eighth Heavy Bomb Group, being built by Richard Costain Ltd. and {{helped by a}} number of sub contractors during the period 1942/1943. The airfield had a 2,000-yard main runway on an E-W axis and two intersecting runways of 1,400 yards each along with the USAAF standard fifty hardstands, two T2 hangars, one each side of the airfield, Mark II lighting and temporary building accommodation for 2,900 personnel.

25|$|The North West Corner, or North West terrace {{as it is}} {{sometimes}} still referred to as, despite now being all seated is the only major section of the stadium to remain uncovered (the other area is the Kop Corner). The original North West Terrace was built between 1919 and 1920 to adjoin both the North Stand and West Stand, but was demolished in early 1965 and replaced in mid 1966, {{in time for the}} 1966 World Cup. The terrace was not in use for two years, and seats were installed in 1991 along with the Leppings Lane terrace. The stand failed to gain a safety certificate for the 2007–08 season. In recent years it had only been used as overspill for away fans when both the upper and lower tiers of the West Stand have been filled, however in the 2011–12 season, with Wednesday needing to better or match the result of their neighbours to gain promotion {{on the final day of}} the season, the Corner was opened to visiting Wycombe Wanderers fans, with the West Stand used by home supporters. Whilst not being used for seating, the Corner has recently been used as extra advertising space, with advertising boards on the back wall, and more recently a large 'My Sheffield Jobs' seat covering appearing alongside their sponsorship of the North Stand. It is sponsored by Handley Brown. This corner is to be roofed, under the Hillsborough stadium Upgrade plans, yet no work has yet been done, due to owners of the nearby terraces complaining. This corner is commonly nicknamed the 'Crows Nest' by Wednesdayites.The corner is still unable to gain a safety certificate and remains unused by fans. Television company Sky use the corner for their temporary studios and <b>technical</b> <b>area</b> for televised games.|$|E
25|$|Bengaluru FC {{resumed their}} {{campaign}} {{in the second phase}} by playing Mumbai at home. Having received four yellow cards in the season, the captain Sunil Chhetri was suspended in the game and Rino Anto led the team. After goalless first half, Bengaluru were trailing 0–1 after Ebi Sukore scored for Mumbai in 47th minute. Robin Singh equalized in 55th minute and salvaged draw for Bengaluru. In round 19, the battle between top and bottom of the table, Bengaluru FC played away game against Rangdajied United F.C.. After trailing 0–2 in the first half, Bengaluru equalized at 2–2 after quick goals by Chhetri and Rooney in 60th and 61st minutes, but after Ranti Martins' goal in 76th minutes, the match ended as a loss for Bengaluru. Bengaluru FC returned to form in the penultimate home game, when they defeated defending champions Churchill Brothers 3–0, courtesy three second half goals, two by Sunil Chhetri and one by Robin Singh. Bengaluru FC opened up 7 points lead at the top of table when they defeated United S.C. 1–3 in the away game. In the next game, Bengaluru FC could not score a goal and ended up losing 3–0 to Shillong Lajong. Two Bengaluru players Pawan Kumar and Curtis Osano were handed red cards in closing minutes and as a result, would miss the next game. In the last home game, Bengaluru FC played another title contender Pune FC. Bengaluru FC took the lead in 25th minute by a goal from Thoi Singh, but Pune FC equalized in the second half in 73rd minute and the game ended in 1–1. This match broke the highest attendance record at Bangalore Football Stadium with 8,347 people attending the game. With other title contenders, Salgaocar and East Bengal closing-in, Bengaluru FC desperately needed a comfortable margin at the top. In their next away game against Mohun Bagan, Thoi Singh and Sean Rooney scored a goal each in each half and secured 0–2 victory and 4 points lead {{at the top of the}} table. During the game, coach Ashley Westwood was sent off from the <b>technical</b> <b>area</b> for showing continuous dissent. With East Bengal closing in on Bengaluru FC, the team needed a win in the game against Dempo in the next game to ensure the title. Bengaluru FC lead 0–1 at the end of the first half as Sean Rooney scored early in the 2nd minute. They consolidated their lead as Robin Singh and Johnny Menyongar scored a goal each. Dempo threatened with two quick goals in the closing minutes, but Sunil Chhetri's goal, 4 minutes into the additional time ensured 2–4 victory for Bengaluru FC. Bengaluru FC created the history by being the first team to win I-League in its debut year. Bengaluru FC ended their campaign on the winning note when they won their final league game 1–2 against Sporting Clube de Goa due to goals from Robin Singh and Beikhokhei Beingaichho in the second half.|$|E
