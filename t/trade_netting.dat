The considered potential determinants of the real equilibrium exchange rate are the productivity differential, the interest rate differential, the terms of <b>trade,</b> <b>net</b> foreign direct investment, net foreign assets, government consumption {{and the degree of}} openness. We find that the Czech koruna was on average undervalued over the period 1994 to 2004 by about 7 percent with respect to the estimated BEER.

40|$|This paper {{asks whether}} <b>net</b> <b>trade</b> in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) can be {{explained}} by differences in comparative costs and in the exploitation of scale economies. Based on a sample of six countries, it is shown that factor proportions do not significantly affect <b>net</b> <b>trade.</b> In an analysis based on a sample of three countries, we are also able to incorporate technical differences and differences in scale economies. We find no support of these variables significantly affecting <b>net</b> <b>trade</b> either. Therefore, we are fairly confident in drawing the conclusion that for our country sample, <b>net</b> <b>trade</b> {{does not seem to be}} explained by comparative costs, technical differences, or scale economies. This leads us to conclude that measures undertaken to increase trade between MENA countries without simultaneously removing domestic distortions may not be welfare improving. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between vertical intra-industry trade (VIIT) and differences in endowments. We present evidence that the share of VIIT between the European Union (UE) and its 51 major trading partners tends to increase for small differences in endowments and to decrease for wider differences in endowments. This suggests that the relation between VIIT and endowments does not follow the pattern of either horizontal IIT (HIIT) or of the <b>net</b> <b>trade</b> flows (as assumed by most former empirical studies about VIIT). This paper suggests a more complex relationship between VIIT and endowments, arguing that this is {{in accordance with the}} theoretical models. To study this we introduce new variables that relate VIIT to horizontal IIT and VIIT to <b>net</b> <b>trade</b> flows. The results suggest that the share of VIIT in total IIT increases with differences in endowments, and that <b>net</b> <b>trade</b> tends to increase more than VIIT when differences in endowments become wider. This evidence contributes to explain the pattern of VIIT. The results also suggest that VIIT assumes {{a leading role in the}} exchanges of factor services between countries with moderate differences in factor endowments while <b>net</b> <b>trade</b> dominates the <b>net</b> exchanges of factor services between countries with wider differences in factor endowments. ...|$|R

40|$|Opinions {{expressed}} in this paper {{are those of the}} authors and not Knight-Trimark Securities, the National Association of Security Dealers, or Goldman, Sachs & Co. The Relationship between Market-making Revenue, Payment for Order Flow, and Trading Costs for Market Orders We study the division of market-making revenue among dealer, broker, and trader. When Knight Securities, a major Nasdaq dealer, interacts with market orders in actively-traded stocks during the fourth quarter of 1996, we estimate that market-making revenue is $ 0. 057 per share. Knight pays brokers at least $ 0. 025 per share (44 % of revenue) for orders. To examine whether brokers appear to share these payments with traders, we compare <b>net</b> <b>trading</b> costs (<b>trade</b> price <b>net</b> of commissions) for traders using brokers routing Knight orders to estimated <b>net</b> <b>trading</b> costs for traders using the only discount broker we can determine did not directly receive market-making revenue. We find that many orders routed based on order-flow inducements enjoy lower <b>net</b> <b>trading</b> costs, which suggests that payment for order flow does not unambiguously harm traders and challenges the conclusions of extant studies using only trade prices to assess market quality. 1.
