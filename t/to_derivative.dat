5|$|Brushstrokes {{series is}} the name {{for a series of}} {{paintings}} produced in 196566 by Roy Lichtenstein. It also refers <b>to</b> <b>derivative</b> sculptural representations of these paintings that were first made in the 1980s. In the series, the theme is art as a subject, but rather than reproduce masterpieces as he had starting in 1962, Lichtenstein depicted the gestural expressions of the painting brushstroke itself. The works in this series are linked to those produced by artists who use the gestural painting style of abstract expressionism made famous by Jackson Pollock, but differ from them due to their mechanically produced appearance. The series is considered a satire or parody of gestural painting by both Lichtenstein and his critics. After 1966, Lichtenstein incorporated this series into later motifs and themes of his work.|$|E

25|$|On April 16, 1999, Siegel's widow Joanne Siegel, {{and their}} daughter, Laura Siegel Larson, filed a {{copyright}} termination notice. Warner Bros. contested this copyright termination, making {{the status of}} Siegel's share of the copyright {{the subject of a}} legal battle. Warner Bros. and the Siegels entered into discussions on how to resolve the issues raised by the termination notice. DC made a settlement offer to Larson and her family on October 16, 2001, and three days later, DC received a letter from Larson’s attorney accepting the offer, which included millions of dollars in payment in exchange for the copyrights. This offer was set aside by the Siegels at the last minute and in October 2004 they filed suit alleging copyright infringement on the part of Warner Bros. Warner Bros. countersued, alleging, among other arguments, that the termination notice contains defects. On March 26, 2008, Judge Stephen G. Larson of the Federal District Court for the Central District of California ruled that Siegel's estate was entitled to claim a share in the United States copyright. The ruling does not affect the international rights which Time Warner holds in the character through its subsidiary DC Comics. Issues regarding the amount of monies owed Siegel's estate and whether the claim the estate has extends <b>to</b> <b>derivative</b> works such as movie versions will be settled at trial, although any compensation would only be owed from works published since 1999. The case was scheduled to be heard in a California federal court in May 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Pension fund example: [...] A {{pension fund}} owns five-year bonds issued by Risky Corp with par value of $10million. To manage {{the risk of}} losing money if Risky Corp {{defaults}} on its debt, the pension fund buys a CDS from Derivative Bank in a notional amount of $10million. [...] The CDS trades at 200 basis points (200 basis points = 2.00 percent). [...] In return for this credit protection, the pension fund pays 2% of $10million ($200,000) per annum in quarterly installments of $50,000 <b>to</b> <b>Derivative</b> Bank.|$|E

2500|$|The {{copyright}} {{status of}} visual works is less troubled, although still ambiguous. For instance, some visual collage artists {{have argued that}} the first-sale doctrine protects their work. The first-sale doctrine prevents copyright holders from controlling consumptive uses after the [...] "first sale" [...] of their work, although the Ninth Circuit has held that the first-sale doctrine does not apply <b>to</b> <b>derivative</b> works. The de minimis doctrine and the fair use exception also provide important defenses against claimed copyright infringement. The Second Circuit in October, 2006, held that artist Jeff Koons was not liable for copyright infringement because his incorporation of a photograph into a collage painting was fair use.|$|E
2500|$|The rule distinguishes {{transactions}} by banking entities from transactions by nonbank financial companies {{supervised by}} the Federal Reserve Board. [...] The rule states that in general, [...] "an insured depository institution may not purchase an asset from, or sell an asset to, an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder of the insured depository institution, or any related interest of such person ... unless— the transaction is on market terms; {{and if the}} transaction represents more than 10 percent of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution, the transaction has been approved in advance {{by a majority of}} the members of the board of directors of the insured depository institution who do not have an interest in the transaction." [...] Providing for the regulation of capital, the Volcker Rule says that regulators are required to impose upon institutions capital requirements that are [...] "countercyclical, so that the amount of capital required to be maintained by a company increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction", to ensure the safety and soundness of the organization. The rule also provides that an insured state bank may engage in a derivative transaction only if the law with respect to lending limits of the state in which the insured state bank is chartered takes into consideration credit exposure <b>to</b> <b>derivative</b> transactions. The title provides for a three-year moratorium on approval of FDIC deposit insurance received after November 23, 2009, for an industrial bank, a credit card bank, or a trust bank that is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a commercial firm.|$|E
