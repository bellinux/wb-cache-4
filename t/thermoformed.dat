The conventional method of designing and making <b>thermoforming</b> moulds is laborious and time consuming.

A CAD model that corresponds to the <b>thermoforming</b> mould of the product is then constructed by using the digitised data. The construction of the mould surface is based on the concept of a defined set of <b>thermoforming</b> mould features. A modified Laplacian smoothing technique is applied to process the digitised data for generating the <b>thermoforming</b> mould surfaces.

50|$|An {{integral}} part of the <b>thermoforming</b> process is the tooling which is specific to each part that is to be produced. Thin-gauge <b>thermoforming</b> as described above is almost always performed on in-line machines and typically requires molds, plug assists, pressure boxes and all mounting plates as well as the trim tooling and stacker parts that pertain to the job. Thick or heavy-gauge <b>thermoforming</b> also requires tooling specific to each part, but because the part size can be very large, the molds can be cast aluminum or some other composite material as well as machined aluminum as in thin gauge. Typically thick-gauge parts must be trimmed on CNC routers or hand trimmed using saws or hand routers. Even the most sophisticated <b>thermoforming</b> machine is limited {{to the quality of the}} tooling. Some large <b>thermoforming</b> manufacturers choose to have design and tool making facilities in house while others will rely on outside tool-making shops to build the tooling.|$|R
40|$|Commercial <b>thermoforming</b> as {{known today}} began about 75 years ago. Unlike other major {{thermoplastic}} production {{processes such as}} injection moulding and extrusion that went through significant technological improvements, <b>thermoforming</b> on an industrial scale still remains a processing technique that is mainly based on operator experience and trial and error. The {{reason for this is}} mainly the lack of knowledge on the influence of process parameters and surrounding conditions on the material behaviour. Insight in thin gauge <b>thermoforming,</b> a <b>thermoforming</b> variant for the processing of thin sheets and foils that is mainly applied in the packaging industry, has recently been improved by the introduction of in-mould monitoring systems. These systems allow for an in-situ measurement of among others: pressures, temperatures, positions and forming forces. In heavy gauge <b>thermoforming</b> however, such tools are not yet available. Typically, the quality of heavy gauge products is assessed on the basis of (manual) tactile, point by point thickness measurements in cross sections or parts of the final product. This makes it hard to define the relation between a specific process setting and the resulting thickness distribution, influenced by all (non-ideal) boundary conditions. In this thesis, an experimental methodology to increase process insight in heavy gauge <b>thermoforming</b> is developed and validated using in-situ, full-field measurements of deformations, combined with pressure and temperature measurements. First, the specific details on how to apply the methodology in <b>thermoforming</b> applications are thoroughly elaborated. Next, it is demonstrated that the use of the methodology provides valuable insights in every step of the <b>thermoforming</b> process and that the proposed approach allows to define the process settings that are responsible for the quality of the final product. Besides this direct benefit, the approach {{can also be used to}} (i) identify specific <b>thermoforming</b> simulation parameters, (ii) establish the link between simulation and process parameters and (iii) facilitate the comparison of simulation results with results from production. From an industrial point of view and with the increasing urge for automation it is clear that this enhanced insight into the process and the possibility to more accurately execute simulations can make heavy gauge <b>thermoforming</b> more stable, reduce start-up and cycle times and minimize the need for operator experience. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|AIM: Despite a very {{significant}} increase in the use of <b>thermoform</b> retainers, within orthodontics, to date, there is no evidence regarding the quality of fit between the dental cast and retainer. The current study aims to compare the fit of different <b>thermoform</b> retainer materials, under laboratory standardized conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, laboratory-based study design was adopted to compare the fit of four different commercially available <b>thermoform</b> retainer materials. A master dental cast was fabricated in dental stone, to which three and five specific reference points were located on the central incisors and upper first molars, respectively. The master cast was then duplicated to produce a total of 40 such dental casts. The performance of the following four test materials was investigated: ACE, C+ (Raintree Essix Glenroe), True Tain (True Tain Inc.), and Iconic Clear (DB Orthodontics). For each material, 10 <b>thermoform</b> retainers were fabricated within the dental laboratory. Subsequent scanning and analysing of the casts and <b>thermoform</b> retainers was performed in a dedicated area, using the co-ordinate measuring machine, in order to calculate their respective fit at the incisor and first molar regions. RESULTS: At all eight recorded landmark points, the mean values for the following <b>thermoform</b> materials: ACE, True Tain, and Iconic Clear, a similar trend was observed. At all eight points, {{there was a significant difference}} between the performance of the four different materials (P < 0. 001), with the greatest difference observed in the mean values in relation to material C+.

40|$|The <b>thermoforming</b> {{process is}} only one of the many {{manufacturing}} methods that converts plastic material into numerous products. As with many <b>thermoforming</b> companies the process is not used to its full potential. The major goal of this work was to develop a non-isothermal simulation of the plug assisted <b>thermoforming</b> process which has direct practical relevance with the <b>thermoforming</b> industry. The simulation would be used as design tool to help improve the process, enabling investigations into changes in product/tooling design and processing conditions, prior to production. Development of robust and accurate simulations has been difficult due to the interactions that exist between the key process elements, such as; highly non-linear material response, heat transfer and friction. For these reasons a fUlly coupled non-isothermal simulation of the plug assisted <b>thermoforming</b> process does not exist. To reduce the scope of this work a previously developed constitutive material model capable of predicting the deformation response of the material used in this work was adopted therefore allowing for more simulation and experimental investigations... A detailed experimental programme was carried out on a single shot experimental <b>thermoforming</b> machine to investigate the effect of the major <b>thermoforming</b> processing variables such as plug speed, sheet temperature etc. In addition a series of friction and heat transfer experiments were conducted using specially adapted test equipment in an attempt to isolate and understand each contact phenomena better. The information obtained from the experiments was used in the construction and validation of the developed simulation which was carried out using the finite element package ABAQUSÃ‚Â®/Standard. Initial isothermal simulations were used to investigate the effects of friction only on the simulated output. The simulation capabilities were improved by incorporating heat transfer effects and a fully coupled temperature dependant simulation is presented. The peiiormance of the simulation was validated against the experimental data obtained from the <b>thermoforming</b> trials and the trends observed were highly comparable. The overall project goals were met with the development of a working nonisothermal simulation incorporating all aspects of the plug assisted <b>thermoforming</b> process such as heat transfer and friction, however further work is required on the constitutive material modelling aspects of the work to improve the simulation capabilities.
