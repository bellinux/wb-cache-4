The Yunnan Army and the Black Flags raised the siege and drew off to the west, and the {{relieving}} force entered the beleaguered post on 3 March. Brière de l’Isle praised the courage of the hard-pressed garrison in a widely quoted order of the day. 'Today, you enjoy the admiration {{of the men who}} have relieved you at such heavy cost. <b>Tomorrow,</b> all <b>France</b> will applaud you!' ...|$|R

You victoriously repelled seven assaults. One man in every three of you and nearly all your officers were scorched by mines or struck by Chinese bullets and shells; but {{the bodies of the}} enemy still choke the three breaches vainly made in the fortress's defences. Today, you enjoy the admiration of the brave soldiers who have relieved you at the cost of so much hardship and bloodshed. <b>Tomorrow,</b> all <b>France</b> will applaud you. Furthermore, you will all be able to say with pride: [...] "I served in the Tuyen Quang garrison; I was on the gunboat Mitrailleuse.") ...|$|R

5000|$|Leaving de Négrier at Lang Son {{with the}} 2nd Brigade, Brière de l'Isle {{personally}} led Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade back to Hanoi, and then upriver to {{the relief of}} Tuyên Quang. The brigade, reinforced at Phu Doan on 24 February by a small column from Hung Hoa {{under the command of}} Lieutenant-Colonel de Maussion, found the route to Tuyên Quang blocked by a strong Chinese defensive position at Hòa Mộc. On 2 March 1885 Giovanninelli attacked the left flank of the Chinese defensive line. The Battle of Hòa Mộc was the most fiercely fought action of the war. Two French assaults were decisively repulsed, and although the French eventually stormed the Chinese positions, they suffered very high casualties (76 dead and 408 wounded). Nevertheless, their costly victory cleared the way to Tuyên Quang. The Yunnan Army and the Black Flags raised the siege and drew off to the west, and the relieving force entered the beleaguered post on 3 March. Brière de l'Isle praised the courage of the hard-pressed garrison in a widely quoted order of the day. ‘Today, you enjoy the admiration of the men who have relieved you at such heavy cost. <b>Tomorrow,</b> all <b>France</b> will applaud you!’ ...|$|R

He mended but slowly, and Turenne, {{a month after the}} surrender of the town, came in one day to see him, and said, [...] "The surgeon tells me that it will be some months before you are fit for service again, and that you will need a period of perfect rest to recover your health. There is a convoy of invalids returning to <b>France</b> <b>tomorrow,</b> and I think it were best that you should accompany them. There is no rest to be obtained here, and I know that you will be fretting at being unable to ride, and at your forced inactivity. I shall give orders that you are conveyed in a horse litter to Sedan, where my brother, the Duc de Bouillon, will gladly entertain you for my sake, and you must remain there until entirely restored to strength.|$|R
