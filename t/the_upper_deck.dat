5|$|Beginning in 1915, {{the main}} deck 6-inch guns of the Monmouth-class ships {{were moved to}} <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> and given gun shields; their casemates were plated over to improve the ships' seakeeping. The 12-pounder guns {{displaced}} by the transfer were repositioned elsewhere. At {{some point in the}} war, three 3-pounder anti-aircraft guns were installed on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
5|$|By Day 20 {{the forward}} {{part of the}} bow was in {{position}} and the hull plating was well underway. By Day 55 all of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> beams were in place and by Day 83 <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> plates were in position. By Day 125 (4 February) the hull was finished.|$|E
5|$|Two 274-millimetre Modèle 1870 {{guns were}} mounted in barbettes on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck,</b> one {{gun at the}} forward corner of the battery, with the {{remaining}} six 274-millimetre Modèle 1870 guns on the battery deck below the barbettes. Eight 138-millimetre Modèle 1870 guns were on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck,</b> fore and aft of the barbettes, and on the battery deck.|$|E
50|$|One major {{innovation}} of the multi-purpose parks was <b>the</b> cantilevered <b>upper</b> <b>deck.</b> In earlier ballparks, {{the columns}} {{used to support}} <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>decks</b> obstructed <b>the</b> view from some seats in <b>the</b> lower <b>deck.</b> <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>decks</b> were extended upwards and the columns removed. However, even though the extension counterbalanced some of <b>the</b> weight, <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>decks</b> could no longer extend {{as close to the}} field and had to be moved back. Also, the roofs could no longer be as large, and often only covered the top 15 or so rows. This exposed fans to the elements.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> two <b>Upper</b> <b>Decks</b> were {{connected}} to enclose the south end zone during two expansions in 1972 and 1976. <b>The</b> 1972 Southwest <b>Upper</b> <b>Deck</b> addition extended <b>the</b> West <b>Upper</b> <b>Deck</b> to <b>the</b> south by 6,221 seats, and <b>the</b> 1976 Southeast <b>Upper</b> <b>Deck</b> addition extended <b>the</b> East <b>Upper</b> <b>Deck</b> to <b>the</b> south by 9,600, giving contiguous upper seating around three sides, and increasing total capacity to 80,250.|$|R

5|$|Rossia {{returned}} to Kronstadt, arriving on 8 April 1906, {{where she was}} given a lengthy refit that was finished in 1909. Her engines and boilers were reconditioned, her mainmast was removed and she received additional six-inch guns. Six more guns in lightly armored casemates were added on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck,</b> positioned on each side in the intervals between the main-deck six-inch guns. In addition the bow gun was moved to <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> {{to allow it to}} fire to each side. This increased the ship's broadside by four guns.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the war, the main deck six-inch guns of the Devonshire-class ships were moved to <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> and given gun shields. Their casemates were plated over to improve {{seakeeping}} and the four 3-pounder guns displaced by the transfer were landed.|$|E

5|$|General Admirals {{armament}} {{was made}} and installed in Russia. Her battery deck carried thirty-six 60-pounder muzzle-loading guns and four long 36-pounder chase guns. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> had twenty-four 60-pounder guns and two long 36-pounder chase guns. Two 3-pood shell guns were mounted fore and aft on revolving platforms. In 1862 her armament was revised and two 60-pounder and the two long 36-pounder guns on her upper deck were removed. Four years later, it was rearranged with two 60-pounders moved from her upper deck to the lower deck and two long 36-pounders moved from the lower deck to <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} of the Hector-class ships {{was intended}} to be 32 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns, 15 on each side on the main deck and one each fore and aft as chase guns on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck.</b> This was modified during Hectors construction to four rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns mounted on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> and twenty-four 68-pounders on the broadside. Valiant, due to the delays in her construction and a shortage of guns, never received any of these guns. The breech-loading guns were a new design from Armstrong and much was hoped for them. To partially alleviate their overweight condition the ships were not fully armed and only received four 110-pounders on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> and twenty 68-pounders on the main deck behind armour. Firing tests carried out in September 1861 against an armoured target, however, proved that the 110-pounder was inferior to the 68-pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863–64 caused the navy to withdraw the gun from service shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|A major {{accident}} {{occurred at the}} bridge in August 1931. The paddle steamer E.R.O. struck the lift span of the bridge. The span had not been raised to a high enough level, causing it to clip {{the top of the}} steamer's funnel and rip apart <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck.</b> High pressure steam was released during the accident causing some onlookers to believe the boat was on fire. It was at first thought the captain would be found amongst the wreckage of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck,</b> but he had been navigating the boat from the lower deck at that time. The captain displayed considerable skill; he immediately realised that further raising of the span despite being given the all clear meant it was not quite high enough. And through his actions as the boat progressed downstream caught in the current, he prevented the boat becoming stuck at the bridge.|$|E
50|$|With the {{addition}} of <b>the</b> west <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> in 1980 and <b>the</b> east <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> in 1987, <b>the</b> stadium became {{the largest in the}} state of Alabama until the 2006 and 2010 expansion of Bryant-Denny Stadium (capacity 101,821) at Alabama. The 2004 stadium expansion extended <b>the</b> east <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> by an additional section on each end, adding more luxury suites and additional general seating to reach the current capacity of 87,451.|$|R

5|$|Both {{ships were}} rearmed {{in the late}} 1860s with 14 seven-inch and 2 eight-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns. The new guns were heavier so fewer could be carried. On both ships the eight-inch guns were mounted {{amidships}} on the main deck on the broadside {{and a pair of}} seven-inch guns were mounted on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> as fore and aft chase guns. Eight of the remaining seven-inch guns were also placed on the main deck on the broadside where they were protected by the ship's armour, but one pair was on the main deck further aft where they were not protected by armour. The two ships differed where the last pair of seven-inch guns was positioned: Defence mounted them on the main deck, forward of the armour, while Resistance mounted hers on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
5|$|By February 1916, all of {{the lower}} casemates for her six-inch guns had been plated over and six {{of them had been}} remounted on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> so they could be used in heavy weather. Several twelve-pounders had to be removed {{to make room for the}} six-inch guns.|$|E
5|$|During her Royal Navy {{service as}} HMS President, she was {{initially}} rated at 50 guns, {{although she was}} at this stage armed with 60 guns—thirty 24-pounders (10.9kg) on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck,</b> twenty-eight 42-pounder (19kg) carronades on the spar deck, plus two more 24-pounder guns on the forecastle. In February 1817, she was again re-rated, this time to 60 guns.|$|E
50|$|The Ann Arbor Railroad, Grand Trunk, and Chesapeake and Ohio ran train ferries across Lake Michigan. Several {{of these}} also carried {{passengers}} in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>decks.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Truelove {{was a full}} rigged ship, {{with three}} masts and square rig. She was {{constructed}} with a [...] "tumble home" [...] design, with her hull sides (topsides) sloping inwards to <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>decks</b> from <b>the</b> water line. Her topsides were constructed with planks overlapping {{in such a way}} as to allow water to drain freely from <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>decks.</b> <b>The</b> ship's usual maximum speed was 8 kn. While operating as a merchant ship, she was fitted with twelve guns for defence against French attack.|$|R
5|$|Royal Oak was {{initially}} armed with 24 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder {{guns on the}} main deck and 11 rifled breech-loading (RBL) Armstrong seven-inch, 110-pounder guns. Eight of these were also on the main deck {{and the other three}} served as chase guns on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck,</b> two at the bow and one aft.|$|E
5|$|The Audacious-class ironclads {{were laid}} out as central battery ironclads with the {{armament}} concentrated amidships. They were the first British ironclads to have a two-deck battery with <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> guns sponsoned out over {{the sides of the}} hull. The ships were fitted with a short, plough-shaped ram and their crew numbered 450 officers and men.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} of the Hector-class ships {{was intended}} to be 32 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns, 15 on each side on the main deck and one each fore and aft as chase guns on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck.</b> This was modified during construction to four rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns and twenty-four 68-pounders.

50|$|Standard class {{cars had}} regular 2+2 seating. The two bilevel cars had Green (first class) {{accommodation}} on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>decks</b> with 2+1 seating, and standard-class accommodation {{on the lower}} decks, also with 2+1 seating.|$|R
5|$|The {{armament}} of the Warrior-class ships {{was intended}} to be 40 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns, 19 on each side on the main deck and one each fore and aft as chase guns on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck.</b> This was modified during construction to ten rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns, twenty-six 68-pounders, and four rifled breech-loading 40-pounder guns.|$|E
5|$|Third-class {{passenger}} accommodations {{were located}} on the main deck: three compartments for men located forward, and a single compartment for families at the rear. The family compartment had state rooms containing either two, four, or six bunks. All compartments had well-lighted dining areas and wide hallways that led to lavatories and sanitary facilities on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
