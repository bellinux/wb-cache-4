5|$|On {{very rare}} occasions, a {{combination}} of the weight distribution of the train, the force of the launch, and the wind can stall a train {{on the top of the}} tower. When this happens, a mechanic takes <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top and pushes the train down the hill.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{commuter}} rail platform was also temporarily {{out of service}} for maintenance during the same period; a shuttle bus ran between Harvard, Porter and Waltham. The Red Line elevator was returned to service on June 22, 2012, and the {{commuter rail}} elevator returned to service on July 30, 2012.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a 2006 {{settlement}} of a lawsuit filed by the Boston Center for Independent Living and a group of individuals, the MBTA installed additional elevators at Porter and four other busy MBTA subway stations. <b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Red Line was out of service for 15 months beginning in March 2011 for car replacement and the installation of a second, redundant, elevator. An accessible shuttle bus ran between Porter and Davis.|$|E
50|$|Behind {{the wing}} {{trailing}} edge {{and the end}} of the lower girder the rear fuselage was a tapering, vertically orientated, two bay Warren truss, ending at a vertical cross member which supported the rudder. The triangular tailplane and fin were mounted on the horizontal upper fuselage beam and the straight edged rudder extended down through a cut-out between <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower beam.|$|R

25|$|There are two entrances/exits {{from this}} station via the same fare control. The main entrance/exit at the {{southwest}} corner of 191st Street and St. Nicholas Avenue is at the summit of a hill and accessible only by a set of four <b>elevators.</b> <b>The</b> <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mezzanine still utilize <b>elevator</b> operators, and <b>the</b> station is one of the only stations in <b>the</b> system <b>to</b> do so. <b>The</b> other entrance/exit, at 190th Street and Broadway west of the station, is at a hillside and accessed via a three-block long passageway, which passes under Wadsworth Terrace and Avenue.|$|R
5|$|Unarmed at first, Hawkins {{entered the}} south {{entrance}} of the Von Maur department store at about 1:36p.m. CST (19:36 UTC). After walking a short distance into the store, he scanned the area, turned around and left. Returning six minutes later through the same entrance, he proceeded directly to the elevator at his immediate right, {{this time with a}} Century WASR-10 (a commercial copy of the AKM (7.62×39mm) semi-automatic rifle) stolen from his stepfather's house, along with two 30-round magazines taped together, concealed in a sweatshirt. He took <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top floor.|$|E
25|$|In 1943, the Lisbon Electric Tramway Ltd. {{solicited}} {{the city}} council to authorize the transfer of <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Companhia da Carris. The process was approved, with the condition that its operation should {{be integrated into the}} transport network, with the Companhia da Carris as the principal.|$|E
25|$|Each Nike battery {{consisted}} {{of two or three}} areas; IFC, LA and general. The LA consisted to a maximum of four launching sections, each section {{consisted of}} an underground storage area, an elevator to move missiles to and from the surface launchers, and four aboveground firing locations. One of these locations was directly above the elevator, the others were reached by manually pushing the missiles off <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> launcher along rails. The LA also had a control van to control and monitor the LA activities and maintenance facilities.|$|E
25|$|In <b>the</b> mid-2000s, an <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{street and}} <b>elevators</b> between <b>the</b> {{mezzanine}} and each platform were installed, making the station ADA-accessible.|$|R
50|$|Exiting {{the level}} (which {{can be done}} at any time, not just after the ninth hieroglyph is taken) takes <b>the</b> {{astronaut}} <b>to</b> an <b>elevator.</b> This is operated by a crank, and <b>the</b> player needs <b>to</b> rotate <b>the</b> joystick through all directions in order <b>to</b> move <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next level. If the player misses a direction during the rotation, then <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> plummets down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next level with significant loss of energy. The player may also proceed directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> third level without completing, or even visiting, the second level.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the static}} margin, humans {{may not be}} able to use control inputs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> control <b>the</b> pitch of the vehicle. Typically, {{computer}} based autopilots are required <b>to</b> control <b>the</b> vehicle when it has negative static stability - usually described as negative static margin.|$|R
25|$|He took <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{executive}} {{reception area}} {{on the third floor}} and, as soon as the doors opened, fired at receptionists Sharon Needy, whom he killed, and Angela Bowman, whom he paralyzed with a shot in the back. Searching for Standard Gravure's President, Michael Shea, and other supervisors and managers of the plant, Wesbecker calmly walked through the hallways, deliberately shooting at people. He killed James Husband and injured Forrest Conrad, Paula Warman and John Stein, a bindery supervisor whom he shot in the head and abdomen. Wesbecker then headed {{down the stairs to the}} pressroom, where he killed Paul Sallee and wounded Stanley Hatfield and David Sadenfaden, two electricians from Marine Electric who were working on a broken machine.|$|E
25|$|Kileak: The DNA Imperative is a first-person shooter, {{in which}} the player {{controls}} an International Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) polar operative Matt Coda in an armored SJ 107 assault suit. The player can advance and retreat, move {{from side to side}} and rotate the camera in any direction. The game is set in a South Pole observation base, which is composed of floors connected by elevators. On each floor, the player must find an elevator in order to proceed to the level below. The requirements are varied between floors, with many levels requiring the use of key cards to open locked doors, while some doors are opened by puzzle solving. On reaching <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next floor, the player can save their progress to a memory card that fits into the accompanying PlayStation.|$|E
25|$|Back at the garden, Lucy is {{planting}} seeds {{around the}} well, when Jacinda arrives {{to take her}} to Bainbridge Island across the lake, so they can be together and escape from Victoria. When they arrive at the town line, Jacinda's car breaks down and <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> docks has been closed, which Lucy believes means they're trapped in Hyperion Heights, much like the residents of Storybrooke were. At the police station, Victoria interrupts Henry and Rogers to ask the officer to help find Lucy and Jacinda, believing that Henry knows something. Victoria's daughter Ivy and Officer Rogers find the pair, who have decided to stay and fight Victoria's claim. As Ivy gives Rogers Lucy's Once Upon a Time book, and insists that it be thrown away, Rogers catches sight of a specific page featuring a picture of Emma Swan.|$|E
50|$|From {{the roof}} of Pierson Aviation, Parker drops in and enters the {{building}} through a hole cut in the glass window. She overrides <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> and sends Hardison and Eliot (who are on top of <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> shaft) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> server room.|$|R
25|$|In 2000, DART's Cityplace Station, {{after years}} of planning, opened beneath North Central Expressway with entrances {{on both sides of}} the highway, the east side being in the bottom of the tower, the west in an {{aluminum}} and glass hut above <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> shaft <b>to</b> <b>the</b> station's upper level under the expressway.|$|R
50|$|Future {{plans call}} for <b>the</b> {{addition}} of <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> platform and street, which would make the station fully compliant with accessibility guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.|$|R
25|$|It is {{uncertain}} which Allied unit {{was first to}} reach the Kehlsteinhaus; several claim the honor, compounded by confusion with the town of Berchtesgaden, which was taken on May 4 by forward elements of the 7th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division. Reputedly members of the 7th {{went as far as}} <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kehlsteinhaus, with at least one individual claiming he and a partner continued on to the top. However, the 101st Airborne maintains it was first both to Berchtesgaden and the Kehlsteinhaus. Also, elements of the French 2nd Armored Division, Laurent Touyeras, Georges Buis and Paul Répiton-Préneuf, were present on the night of May 4 to 5, and took several photographs before leaving on May 10 at the request of US command, and this is supported by testimonies of the Spanish soldiers who went along with them.|$|E
25|$|From 1930 to 1975, the Great Falls High School {{building}} housed Paris Gibson Junior High School. The north entrance {{was closed}} in the 1940s after the front steps were discovered to be sinking. The driveway {{in front of this}} entrance was removed in the 1970s and replaced with sod. The south entrance was used as the main entrance after 1940. In the late 1960s, while repairs to the structure's roof were being made, a student broke into the building and climbed atop the elevator. He rode <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roof. But he touched a power line as he climbed off the elevator, giving him a severe electrical shock and causing his shirt to catch fire. He survived with minimal injuries. Another accident occurred shortly before the building was {{closed in the}} 1970s. A student in the gymnasium (which was housed in the brick annex), attempted to do chin-ups on a water pipe. The pipe snapped, causing the gym to be flooded.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, {{the hills}} were the eleventh-most visited tourist {{attraction}} in Norway. The hill has a souvenir shop and visitors {{are permitted to}} take <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the hill. Alternatively, tourists can walk the 954 steps to the top. In 2006, the BBC One television show Top Gears episode [...] "Winter Olympics Special", was filmed at various Olympic venues around Lillehammer. It included a successful attempt at a ski jump using an unoccupied rocket-powered British Leyland Mk V Mini. KT Tunstall shot {{the majority of the}} video for her 2008 single [...] "If Only" [...] at Lysgårdsbakken.|$|E
50|$|A camera {{recognises}} {{the concentration}} of chaff and broken grain in the sample as it is transferred through <b>the</b> grain <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grain tank; this information is shown on the IntelliView III monitor {{in the form of}} a graph, allowing <b>the</b> operator <b>to</b> fine tune adjustments, further boosting grain purity.Grain Cam was awarded by the Gold Medal for innovation at Agritechnica in 2007.|$|R
2500|$|After {{a series}} of these drops have been made, <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{basement}} of the decrepit Hollywood Tower Hotel, past a curious array of abandoned items. A short clip plays, showing elements from the Season 5 opening sequence, along with <b>the</b> 1939 <b>elevator</b> passengers and Rod Serling falling into the [...] "vortex" [...] seen in the Season 3 opening sequence. Serling's voice says: ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was {{in three}} sections. Behind the engine compartment {{there was a}} simple duraluminum section containing the open, tandem cockpits, the forward one being below mid-chord. The rear fuselage was a fabric covered tube steel structure, with the wood and fabric in-flight adjustable strut braced tailplane mounted on top. The fin, of similar construction, [...] was broad and round edged, carrying the rudder which extended between <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fuselage bottom. Production machines had a new, triangular fin. The undercarriage was fixed and wide track (2.60m or 8ft6in), with near vertical main legs mounted on the forward lift struts. The tops of the legs were further braced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upper fuselage. [...] Split axles were fixed at the bottoms of the forward lift struts; single wheels were fitted with balloon tyres and had differential brakes for ground steering. [...] The first prototype had a steerable tailskid, replaced by a tailwheel in later aircraft.|$|R
500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{focused on}} Frank's alleged sexual behavior. They alleged that Frank, with Conley's assistance, regularly met {{with women in}} his office for sexual relations. On {{the day of the}} murder, Conley said he saw Phagan go upstairs, from where he heard a scream coming shortly after. He then said he dozed off; when he woke up, Frank called him upstairs and showed him Phagan's body, admitting that he had hurt her. Conley repeated statements from his affidavits that he and Frank took Phagan's body to the basement via the elevator, before returning in <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> office [...] where Frank dictated the murder notes.|$|E
2500|$|Mary Lucille Wolf {{purchased}} {{a ticket for}} <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> observation deck on May 25, 1974 where she proceeded to scale the glass fence surrounding the deck onto the edge and jumped off in what the Seattle Police Department called [...] "an obvious suicide". Police found a correspondence in Wolf's purse that was from a friend extending their condolences regarding the recent death of Wolf's husband.|$|E
60|$|The {{charge was}} three dollars, which Duncan with some {{difficulty}} managed to pay; and then we took <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> third floor.|$|E
25|$|From the assembler, the {{assembled}} line moves via <b>the</b> first <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> justification vise. The vise has two jaws (1 and 2 in the illustration) which are set <b>to</b> <b>the</b> desired line width. The spacebands are now expanded <b>to</b> justify <b>the</b> line. When {{the line is}} justified, the matrices fit tightly between the vise jaws, forming a tight seal which will prevent the molten type metal from escaping when the line is cast.|$|R
25|$|The station {{maintains}} three <b>elevators</b> from <b>the</b> mezzanine in one {{tower at}} its eastern end, {{and has done}} so since its opening. There is access from Bennett Avenue via a tunnel. <b>The</b> <b>elevators</b> were formerly only open during the daytime, and required the payment of a fare <b>to</b> use since <b>the</b> fare control for both street entrances <b>to</b> <b>the</b> station was originally located just inside the street doors. Since 1957, <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> have been available for use by pedestrians going between Bennett Avenue and Fort Washington Avenue without paying a fare; a similar situation exists at 181st Street, the next station downtown, {{as well as at}} 191st Street, on the IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line. <b>The</b> <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mezzanine still utilize <b>elevator</b> operators, one of the few stations in <b>the</b> system <b>to</b> do so. <b>The</b> station is not wheelchair accessible (non-ADA-compliant) because access from the fare control area <b>to</b> <b>the</b> platforms is only possible via stairways. The nearest accessible stations are 175th Street, two stops south, and 207th Street, two stops north.|$|R
50|$|A bond {{measure to}} raise $12,000 for {{construction}} {{was put to}} voters in July 1912. This levy failed, but a second referendum passed in December of the same year. <b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> opened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public in 1915, delayed by politics. <b>The</b> original <b>elevator</b> was water-powered and took three minutes for <b>the</b> ride. <b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> was so popular {{that most of the}} cliffside stairs were removed. <b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> was converted <b>to</b> electric drive in 1924, which reduced <b>the</b> time <b>to</b> 30 seconds.|$|R

50|$|As of August 2016, the Moroun {{family has}} spent 10 years and $12 million on electricity, windows and <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> shaft, <b>to</b> revitalize <b>the</b> building. Matthew Moroun {{said he might}} put part of his family's {{operations}} in the 18-story Corktown building.|$|R
2500|$|With time an issue, the {{construction}} team worked around the clock. The domed top, housing {{the top five}} levels (including the restaurants and observation deck), was perfectly balanced so that the restaurant could rotate {{with the help of}} one tiny electric motor, originally , later replaced with a [...] motor. With paint colors named Orbital Olive for the body, Astronaut White for the legs, Re-entry Red for the saucer, and Galaxy Gold for the roof, the Space Needle was finished in less than one year. It was completed in April 1962 at a cost of $4.5 million. <b>The</b> last <b>elevator</b> car was installed the day before the Fair opened on April 21. During the course of the Fair nearly 20,000 people a day rode <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Observation Deck. The 20,000 mark was never reached, missed by fewer than 50 people one day. At the time of construction, it was the tallest building in the West, taking the title from the Smith Tower across town that had held that title since 1914.|$|R
50|$|He {{releases}} all the bulls, which immediately {{start running}} {{through the streets of}} Springfield, causing a great deal of destruction and injuring everyone.
