5|$|After the Tour of Life, Bush {{wanted to}} make two more albums before <b>touring</b> again. At that point, she got {{involved}} with production techniques and sound experimentation that took {{up a lot of}} time and prevented her from <b>touring.</b> She came close to <b>touring</b> again following the release of The Dreaming and The Red Shoes, but live shows never materialised.|$|E
5|$|After {{the breakup}} of The Get Up Kids, James Dewees toured with New Found Glory as their <b>touring</b> keyboardist, having been {{featured}} on their 2003 album Catalyst. While he was <b>touring,</b> his ongoing struggles with {{alcohol and drug abuse}} worsened. After moving to New York City, he began to attend rehab, a process which would inspire the fifth Reggie and the Full Effect album, Last Stop: Crappy Town. After another brief tour opening for Hellogoodbye in 2006, he joined My Chemical Romance as their full-time <b>touring</b> keyboardist.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking a}} two-month break {{following}} the band's Black Clouds and Underdogs tour in promotion of their 2005 album From Under the Cork Tree, Fall Out Boy {{returned to the}} studio to begin work on their follow-up effort. The band began writing songs for the new album while <b>touring,</b> and intended to quickly make a new album {{in order to keep}} momentum in the wake of their breakthrough success. Vocalist Patrick Stump stated that he wished to begin working on the record earlier, but the group's management urged the members to take time off to recuperate from their constant <b>touring</b> schedule.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking the}} end of 2003 off from <b>touring</b> to begin working on an album, the band {{scheduled}} time in February 2004 to begin recording.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham Repertory Theatre is Britain's longest-established {{producing}} theatre, {{presenting a}} wide variety of work in its three auditoria on Centenary Square and <b>touring</b> nationally and internationally. Other producing theatres in the city include the Blue Orange Theatre in the Jewellery Quarter; the Old Rep, home stage of the Birmingham Stage Company; and @ A. E. Harris, the base of the experimental Stan's Cafe theatre company, located within a working metal fabricators' factory. <b>Touring</b> theatre companies include the politically radical Banner Theatre, the Maverick Theatre Company and Kindle Theatre. The Alexandra Theatre and the Birmingham Hippodrome host large-scale <b>touring</b> productions, while professional drama is performed {{on a wide range of}} stages across the city, including the Crescent Theatre, the Custard Factory, the Old Joint Stock Theatre, the Drum in Aston and the mac in Cannon Hill Park.|$|E

5|$|Created in 2006, the Billboard <b>Touring</b> Awards is {{an annual}} meeting {{sponsored}} by Billboard Magazine to award best live performances. Swift has received 3 awards from 10 nominations.|$|E
5|$|Critical and {{commercial}} response to Nine Inch Nails live performances {{has generally been}} positive. Critics have pointed to the concerts' aggressive on-stage dynamic and visual designs as high points. Reznor decided in 2008 to cease <b>touring</b> with the band after a 2009 farewell tour. The band resumed <b>touring</b> in 2013, with the group planning a set of concerts in the U.S. beginning September 28.|$|E
5|$|Determined {{to offset}} the impact that the tour {{would have on the}} environment, Music for Relief and {{environmental}} non-profit Rewerb promoted greener <b>touring</b> practices such as recycling throughout the venue, free water stations for refillable bottles, reusable products and carpooling incentives. <b>Touring</b> vehicles were powered by low-emissions renewable biodiesel, a fuel made partly from vegetable oil. Non-profit organizations Love Hope Strength and HeadCount joined the tour for select dates.|$|E
5|$|Dewhurst {{continued}} to play for Trinidad between 1923 and 1926, although, owing to his business commitments, {{he was unable to}} play in every game. In 1926 he played against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which was <b>touring</b> the West Indies, for both Trinidad and a West Indies team. He passed fifty three times against the <b>touring</b> team, and such was his improvement as a batsman that critics suggested he could hold a place in the West Indies team for his batting alone. However, Dewhurst did not play another first-class match until 1930.|$|E
5|$|During 2014, Elliot Williams {{left the}} band {{for a period}} of <b>touring</b> to work on his own music project YdotOdotU, {{supporting}} The 1975. The band continued to tour with musician Nicholas Willes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} when the Gilbert and Sullivan operas were being written, Richard D'Oyly Carte also {{produced}} operas and plays by other writing teams, {{as well as other}} works to fill the Savoy Theatre in between new operas. Many of these were companion pieces to the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, as the Victorian audiences preferred long evenings in the theatre. Some, however, were new full-length pieces either for the Savoy or for Carte's <b>touring</b> companies, which toured the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and these new works, extensively. Carte and Lenoir also continued to run his management agency. As an example of their level of activity, an 1881 souvenir programme commemorating the 250th performance of Patience in London and its 100th performance in New York states that, in addition to these two productions of Patience, Carte was simultaneously producing many other projects. These included two companies <b>touring</b> with Patience, two <b>touring</b> with other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, one <b>touring</b> with the operetta Olivette (co-produced with Charles Wyndham), one with Claude Duval in America, a production of Youth running at a New York theatre, a lecture tour by Archibald Forbes (a war correspondent) and productions of Patience, Pirates, Claude Duval and Billee Taylor in association with J. C. Williamson in Australia, among other things.|$|E

5|$|From the {{renovation}} in 1980 until 1985 the non-profit 5th Avenue Theatre successfully operated as {{a venue for}} <b>touring</b> Broadway shows. As the United States went through an economic downturn from 1985 to 1989 there was a shortage of <b>touring</b> shows for venues like the 5th. Consequently, many of the country's Broadway houses went unused for extended periods of time. However, the 5th remained open during these years with a reduced staff and was used for community events and local promoters.|$|E
5|$|Guillemin was {{selected}} to play the <b>touring</b> Australians on 2 January 1909, but the match was cancelled due to bad weather.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, Angel premiered {{the stage}} show Mindfreak LIVE! The <b>touring</b> show {{features}} illusions from Angel himself, which received positive reviews. The demonstrations {{used in the}} show were developed in Angel's illusion laboratory in Las Vegas, located in a 60,000 square foot warehouse. His international <b>touring</b> with the show {{marked the first time}} that Angel had travelled with his show in about six years. The premiere show of the performance occurred at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut during November 2014.|$|E

5|$|Interestingly, {{the three}} Queensland players {{selected}} in the <b>touring</b> party - Don Tallon, Bill Brown (cricketer), and Colin McCool were all from Toombul District Cricket Club.|$|E
5|$|Kenney Jones {{replaced}} Moon and {{the group}} resumed activity, releasing a film adaptation of Quadrophenia and the retrospective documentary The Kids Are Alright. After Townshend became weary of <b>touring,</b> the group split in 1982. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985, a 25thanniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of Quadrophenia in 1996–1997. They resumed regular <b>touring</b> in 1999, with drummer Zak Starkey. After Entwistle's death in 2002, {{plans for a new}} album were delayed. Townshend and Daltrey continued as the Who, releasing Endless Wire in 2006, and continued to play live regularly.|$|E
5|$|Note: The pre-City <b>touring</b> line-up {{consisted}} of Townsend, Simon, White, Scribner, Sudar and Meyers.|$|E

Australia won the series two Tests to nil, but Darling's own form was poor. In {{successive}} innings, Darling made 0, 14, 6, 4 and 1. After the tour, he returned to Stonehenge and took a two-year break from first-class cricket. In his absence, Monty Noble captained the Australian team against the <b>touring</b> English in 190304.|$|E
