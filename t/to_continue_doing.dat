500|$|The Globe and Mail, in {{suggesting}} why Nintendo {{posted a}} record loss of $926million {{for the initial}} six months of its 2011–2012 fiscal year, blamed the Wii's design for being [...] "short-sighted". The Wii initially enjoyed phenomenal success because it was inexpensive (due to its being less sophisticated than its competitors) and introduced a [...] "gaming gimmick". However, this approach meant that the Wii's hardware soon became outdated and could not keep up long-term (in contrast to more-advanced rivals such as Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, which are expected <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>doing</b> well in 2012–2013) [...] "as both user desires and surrounding technologies evolved" [...] later in the generation. Furthermore, price cuts {{and the introduction of}} motion-sensor controllers for the Xbox 360 and PS3 nullified advantages once held by the Wii. The Globe suggested that there were other reasons for Nintendo's poor financial performance, including a strong yen and a tepid reception to the Nintendo 3DS handheld as mobile gaming becomes popular on smartphones and tablets (such as the iPad).|$|E
500|$|Major League Baseball has honored Robinson {{many times}} since his death. In 1987, both the National and American League Rookie of the Year Awards were renamed the [...] "Jackie Robinson Award" [...] {{in honor of}} the first {{recipient}} (Robinson's Major League Rookie of the Year Award in 1947 encompassed both leagues). On April 15, 1997, Robinson's jersey number, 42, was retired throughout Major League Baseball, the first time any jersey number had been retired throughout one of the four major American sports leagues. Under the terms of the retirement, a grandfather clause allowed the handful of players who wore number 42 <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>doing</b> so in tribute to Robinson, until such time as they subsequently changed teams or jersey numbers. This affected players such as the Mets' Butch Huskey and Boston's Mo Vaughn. The Yankees' Mariano Rivera, who retired {{at the end of the}} 2013 season, was the last player in Major League Baseball to wear jersey number 42 on a regular basis. Since 1997, only Wayne Gretzky's number 99, retired by the NHL in 2000, has been retired league-wide. There have also been calls for MLB to retire number 21 league-wide in honor of Roberto Clemente, a sentiment opposed by the Robinson family. The Hispanics Across America advocacy group wants Clemente's number set aside the way the late Robinson's No. 42 was in 1997, but Sharon Robinson maintained the position that such an honor should remain in place for Jackie Robinson only.|$|E
