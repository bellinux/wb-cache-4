40|$|Abstract. Tube bending {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{relevant}} manufacturing processes for the production of structural elements, but it suffers from the problem of springback that requires the tuning of the process parameters at every launch of new production batches. Off-line optimization approaches can be found in literature, but they often require complex characterization of the material properties or the application of approaches based on numerical simulation analyses. So, the development of new and more flexible in-line approaches to measure and correct the springback is crucial especially for highly automated machines as for example the <b>tube</b> <b>benders.</b> The paper presents a new measurement approach, based on the application of motion-capture techniques, to provide real-time measurements of the bent tube orientation, in order to decrease the time for the set-up of the main process parameters. A new methodology as well as a new experimental apparatus for the in-line monitoring of the tube springback is presented, as well as the evaluation of its accuracy. An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is linked to the tube during bending and the measurements from three gyroscopes and three accelerometers are used to perform the computation of the tube orientation in the 3 D space. The proposed approach appeared promising for the evaluation of the springback through the measurement of the final angular configuration reached after bending...|$|R
40|$|The {{relations}} {{to calculate the}} maximum value of strains in processes of bending <b>tubes</b> on <b>benders,</b> in stretched layers of tubes, are presented in this work {{on the basis of}} the EU-Directive concerning production of pressure equipment. It has been shown that for large deformations that occur during bending of the pipes on knees, logarithmic strain measures (real) and relative strain measures give different values of strain but equal wall thicknesses in the bending zone. Logarithmic measures are frequently used in engineering practice and are valid for large and small deformations. Reverse expressions were also derived to calculate the required initial wall thickness of the tube to be bent, in order to obtain the desired wall thickness of the knee after bending...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} goal of {{this project}} was to complete the design and building of a disc brake energy conversion project started by a former senior project team, and then spend {{a majority of the}} year performing testing in order to see if the device could be used to accurately calculate the Joule 2 ̆ 7 s constant. However, due to unforeseen complications and obstacles, the design and manufacturing portion of the project ended up taking much longer than anticipated. A majority of this time was spent designing the hydraulic plumbing system that would actuate the brakes. The previous team purchased some hydraulic parts and left them unassembled with no hydraulic schematic, and in order to save money, one of our goals was to use as many of the previous team 2 ̆ 7 s purchased parts as possible. This led to us attempting to complete their hydraulic design using the few parts they had left behind. However, after some time we discovered that the parts they had purchased would not work with the system we were trying to create. After discussion with multiple professors and shop techs, we discovered a hydraulic schematic created by W. C. Branham that would be perfect for our device. After making a few changes to the design, we were able to start manufacturing the hydraulic system using hand-held <b>tube</b> <b>benders</b> and <b>tube</b> cutters. Once the tubing was assembled, we bled the air out of the hydraulic portion of the system and filled it with hydraulic fluid. Then, in order to measure the temperature of the thermistor in the copper brake pads, we programmed an Arduino read the thermistor and collect data. This left us with only three weeks to test; however, through our testing and analysis, we were able to calculate a Joule 2 ̆ 7 s constant within 35...|$|R
50|$|A {{section of}} the glass is heated until it is malleable; then it is bent into shape and aligned to a neon sign pattern paper {{containing}} the graphics or lettering that the final product will ultimately conform to. This is where the real art of neon comes in, that takes some artisans from a year up to several years of practice to master. A <b>tube</b> <b>bender</b> corks off the hollow tube before heating and holds a latex rubber blow hose at the other end, through which he gently presses {{a small amount of}} air to keep the tube diameter constant as it is bending. The trick of bending is to bend one small section or bend at a time, heating one part of the tubing so that it is soft, without heating some other part of the tube as well, which would make the bend uncontrollable. A bend, once the glass is heated, must be brought to the pattern and fitted rapidly before the glass hardens again because it is difficult to reheat once completely cooled without risking breakage. It is frequently necessary to skip one or more bends and come back to it later, by measuring carefully {{along the length of the}} tube. One tube letter may contain 7-10 small bends, and mistakes are not easily corrected without going back and starting all over again. If more tubing is required, another piece is welded onto it, or the parts can be all welded onto each other at the final step. The finished tube must be absolutely vacuum tight to operate, and it must be vacuum clean inside. Once the tube is filled with mercury, if any mistake is made after that, the entire tube has to, or should be, started over anew, because breathing heated mercury impregnated glass and phosphor causes long term heavy metal poisoning in neon workers. Sticks of tubing are joined until the tube reaches an impractical size, and several tubes are joined in series with the high voltage neon transformer. Extreme ends of the electrical circuit must be isolated from each other to prevent tube puncture and buzzing from corona effect.|$|E
40|$|AbstractGenerally speaking, {{hydraulic}} control {{systems can be}} divided into two different driving concepts. The first one is the well-known valve-controlled system and the second one is the pump-controlled system. The former possesses the feature of fast dynamic response. However, the poor energy-saving performance is its major fault. On the contrary, the pump-controlled hydraulic system has the significant advantage of energy-saving which meets the current demand in modern machine design. In this paper, the simulation analysis using Matlab/Simulink and DSHplus for a newly developed energy-saving hydraulic <b>tube</b> <b>bender</b> is conducted. Instead of the conventional fixed displacement hydraulic pump, the new hydraulic <b>tube</b> <b>bender</b> utilizes an internal gear pump with AC servomotor as its driving power source. In the new energy-saving hydraulic circuit, the use of conventional pressure relief valve is no longer necessary since the demanded flow-rate and pressure output can be precisely obtained by continuously changing the speed of the AC servomotor. In addition, from the simulation results, it is shown that the energy-saving performance of load-sensing control scheme is somewhat better than that of constant pressure control scheme. Furthermore, the simulation results also show that the newly developed hydraulic <b>tube</b> <b>bender</b> can save up to 40 % of energy consumption in a working cycle as compared to the conventional hydraulic <b>tube</b> <b>bender...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{relatively}} simple, {{manually operated}} tool enables precise bending (typically, within 1 / 2 of the specified bend angle) of a metal tube {{located in a}} confined space, {{with a minimum of}} flattening of the tube and without significant gouging of the tube surface. The tool is designed for use in {{a situation in which the}} tube cannot be removed from the confined space for placement in a conventional benchmounted <b>tube</b> <b>bender.</b> The tool is also designed for use in a situation in which previously available hand-held tube benders do not afford the required precision, do not support the tube wall sufficiently to prevent flattening or gouging, and/or do not fit within the confined space. The tool is designed and fabricated for the specific outer diameter and bend radius of the tube to be bent. The tool (see figure) includes a clamping/radius block and a top clamping block that contain mating straight channels of semicircular cross section that fit snugly around the tube. The mating portions of the clamping/radius block and the top clamping block are clamped around a length of the tube that is adjacent to the bend and that is intended to remain straight. The clamping/radius block is so named because beyond the straight clamping section, its semicircular channel extends to a non-clamping section that is curved at the specified bend radius. A pivot hole is located in the clamping/radius block at the center of the bend circle. The tool includes a bending block that, like the other blocks, contains a straight semicircular channel that fits around the outside of the tube. The bending block contains a pivot hole to be aligned with the pivot hole in the clamping/radius block. Once the tube has been clamped between the clamping/ radius and top clamping blocks, the bending block is placed around the tube, the pivot holes are aligned, and a pivot pin is inserted through the pivot holes...|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} {{fuel costs}} and the current drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption, a need to reduce vehicle weight is apparent. Weight reduction {{can be achieved by}} replacing conventionally stamped structural members with hydroformed parts. The weight reduction can be further enhanced by reducing the thickness of the hydroformed members through the use of advanced high strength steel (AHSS). A primary limitation in hydroforming AHSS, is the limited ductility or formability of these materials. This limitation becomes acute in multi-stage forming operations in which strain path changes become large making it difficult to predict formability. Thus, the focus of the current work is to study the effects of pre-bending on the subsequent hydroformability of Dual-Phase DP 600 steel tubes. As part of this effort, the effect of key bending and hydroforming process parameters, bending boost and hydroforming end-feed, have been studied in a parametric fashion. Multi-step pre-bending and hydroforming experiments were performed on 76. 2 mm (3. 0 ") OD tubes with a wall-thickness of 1. 85 mm (DP 600). Experiments were also performed on 1. 74 mm Interstitial Free (IF) steel tube, which provided a low strength, high formability baseline material for comparison purposes. A fully instrumented servo-hydraulic mandrel-rotary draw <b>tube</b> <b>bender</b> was used in the pre-bending experiments in which various levels of boost were applied. The results showed that increased boost reduced the major (tensile) strain and thinning at the outside of the bend. At the inside of the bend, the compressive minor strain became larger and thickening increased. Hydroforming of the straight and pre-bent tubes was conducted using various levels of load-control end-feed (EF). For both straight and pre-bend tube hydroforming, an increase in hydroforming EF resulted in increased burst pressure and corner-fill expansion (CFE). The effect of bending boost on CFE was also measured. For a given hydroforming EF case, a tube bent with greater boost achieved a higher burst pressure and consequently a greater CFE which increased the hydroformability of the material. Pre-bending was shown to consume a considerable amount of the formability of the tube in the hydroforming experiments. For the same EF case, the pre-bent tubes could only achieve a fraction of the straight tube CFE at burst. The pre-bending and hydroforming experiments were complimented by finite element simulation in the hope of providing additional insight into these processes. The finite element (FE) models were able to accurately predict the strain and thickness changes imposed during pre-bending. The models were able to accurately predict the CFE, EF displacement, and strain and thickness distributions after hydroforming. The extended stress-based forming limit curve (XSFLC) failure criterion was applied to predict failure (onset of necking) during hydroforming, which was measured as the burst pressure in the experiments. For straight tube hydroforming, the XSFLC predicted the correct failure pressure versus hydroforming EF load trend, but over predicted the failure pressures. In pre-bend hydroforming, the models were able to capture the effect of bending boost and hydroforming EF on the hydroformability of the tubes. The XSFLC was able to capture the drop in formability for bending versus straight tube hydroforming, but was unable to capture the failure pressure versus hydroforming EF load trend or magnitude. Further work is required to make the XSFLC applicable to straight and pre-bend hydroforming...|$|E
