25|$|Prince Shuysky now enters. Boris insults him, {{accusing him}} of conspiring with Pushkin, an {{ancestor}} of the poet. However, the prince brings grave tidings. A Pretender has appeared in Lithuania. Boris angrily demands <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> identity. Shuysky fears the Pretender might attract a following bearing the name of Tsarevich Dmitriy. Shaken by this revelation, Boris dismisses Fyodor. He orders Shuysky to seal the border with Lithuania, and, clearly {{on the edge of}} madness, asks Shuysky whether he has ever heard of dead children rising from their graves to question Tsars. Boris seeks assurance that the dead child the prince had seen in Uglich was really Dmitriy. He threatens Shuysky, if he dissembles, with a gruesome execution. The Prince describes the ghastly scene of Dmitriy's murder in a brief and beautiful aria ("In Uglich, in the cathedral"). But he gives hints that a miracle (incorruptibility) has occurred. Boris begins choking with guilt and remorse, and gives a sign for Shuysky to depart.|$|E
25|$|He {{attended}} the Army War College, and was then stationed in Bangkok. Having concluded {{that he would}} never be promoted to chief of station anywhere, and knowing he was tagged as a Thai/Lao specialist within the CIA, he settled into bureaucracy in his wife's hometown.

When Leka, the exiled monarch of Albania arrived to buy weaponry, Lair prompted the Thai quashing of the arms deal. Most of Lair's duties, though, required him {{to keep track of the}} drug trade in the area. For the most part, the Thai senior officers involved in the opium trade had been trained by Lair. They knew him well enough <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> skepticism about banning drugs, and that he would not retaliate on them. They also knew the king favored him, and that Lair's in-laws were politically influential. Lair would simply ask these officers for needed information, bypassing all the rigamarole of tasking undercover agents to spy upon the drug trade.|$|E

Subsequently, he has been identified by Dagbladet, Nettavisen, TV 2, Dagsavisen, Bergensavisen and Aftenposten.

Bernt Olufsen stated that Verdens Gang chose to identify him because of the scale and seriousness of the crimes, which according to Olufsen meant the public had a right <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> identity.|$|E
