50|$|Tuzly Lagoons (Тузловські лимани, Limanele Tuzlei) are a {{group of}} marine lagoons (limans) in {{southern}} Bessarabia (Budjak), Ukraine. <b>The</b> <b>lagoons</b> are part of <b>the</b> Tuzly <b>Lagoons</b> National Nature Park, proclaimed on January 1, 2010.

50|$|The {{total area}} of <b>the</b> <b>lagoons</b> is 206 km², depth 1.6-2.5 m, {{averaging}} 1.0-1.3 m. <b>The</b> <b>lagoons</b> {{are separated from}} the Black Sea by a 29-km long sandbar, which is 60-400 m wide and 1-3 m high.|$|R
5|$|At Aliso Beach, {{the mouth}} of Aliso Creek, lies a {{freshwater}} pond that changes frequently in elevation and extent. Tidal activity at the creek's mouth results in sediment building gradually up into a sandbar, impounding it in a small lake about 0.2 miles (0.3km) long at its fullest extent. Afterwards, the water level rises upstream of the sandbar until one of two factors causes it to breach: either waves at high tide wash away {{the top of the}} sandbar, or <b>the</b> <b>lagoon</b> rises enough to overtop the sandbar by itself. Once the water level rises above the sandbar, rapid erosion quickly cuts through the sand and drains the approximately 3–5-foot (0.9–1.5 m)-deep lake in a matter of minutes. Peak flows through the sandbar can reach , even if the incoming flow of the creek is nowhere near that size. Because of the raised flow of the creek and the construction of a parking lot in <b>the</b> <b>lagoon</b> area since the 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>lagoon</b> has never been able to fill to its much larger, historic extent without breaching. Species such as the tidewater goby have suffered because of loss of their habitat this way.|$|E
5|$|Make Way for Ducklings is a children's {{picture book}} written and {{illustrated}} by Robert McCloskey.

40|$|A {{series of}} facultative lagoons {{operated}} by Thames Water treating industrial wastewater in Thailand {{were found to}} be performing poorly, particularly with respect to the removal of biological oxygen demand (BOD). A review of the design parameters for the site found that all <b>the</b> <b>lagoons</b> are of a sufficient area for the flow and BOD load. However, observations of <b>the</b> <b>lagoons</b> suggested that there may be significant hydraulic short-circuiting. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling was therefore carried out on one of <b>the</b> <b>lagoons</b> to establish <b>the</b> hydraulic regime. Two-consecutive simulations were carried out, both with and without baffles; the first to establish steady flow conditions, and the second using a chemical species transport model to obtain the residence time distribution (RTD). The results of the modelling indicate that <b>the</b> <b>lagoons</b> do currently suffer from significant short-circuiting, and large dead-zones are present. The installation of baffles in the CFD model improved the plug-flow characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>lagoons,</b> substantially reducing <b>the</b> short-circuiting {{and the size of the}} dead-zones. It has therefore been concluded that the installation of baffles in <b>the</b> <b>lagoons</b> will lead to an improvement in their performance, by increasing the retention time of the system...|$|R
500|$|Large, {{constructed}} saltwater evaporation <b>lagoons</b> surround <b>the</b> only {{road into}} the suburb. Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) began construction of <b>the</b> Solar Evaporation <b>Lagoons</b> in 1935 using up to 600workers {{to dig out}} <b>the</b> <b>lagoons</b> by hand and then expanded them mechanically after World War II. <b>The</b> <b>lagoons</b> stretch in a broken chain from Dry Creek to Port Gawler alongside the Barker Inlet, and are approximately [...] north–south by [...] east–west. <b>The</b> <b>lagoons</b> are filled in spring and salt normally harvested in autumn when it is piped as saturated brine solution to Osborne on the Le Fevre peninsula, and used by Penrice Soda Products in the only soda ash production facility in Australia. <b>The</b> <b>lagoons</b> proliferate with bird life and have been recognised as a bird sanctuary due to their status as an important breeding and feeding area for species {{from as far away}} as Alaska. As of 2006 <b>the</b> <b>Lagoons</b> are operated by Cheetham Salt Limited with 600,000tonnes of salt used by Penrice in creating soda ash via the solvay process.|$|R
50|$|The {{hydrological}} {{balance is}} mostly controlled by meteorological conditions since, due {{the absence of}} significant tides the main factors controlling the water circulation in <b>the</b> <b>lagoons</b> are <b>the</b> wind intensity and direction. On the other hand, because of the limited depth of <b>the</b> <b>lagoons</b> <b>the</b> meteorological changes rapidly affect the abiotic parameters of the water masses.|$|R
5|$|Unmanned {{boats were}} the first vessels to enter <b>the</b> <b>lagoon.</b> Onboard {{instruments}} allowed remote-controlled radiation measurements to be made. When support ships entered <b>the</b> <b>lagoon</b> for evaluation, decontamination, and salvage activities, they steered clear of lagoon water hot spots detected by the drone boats. The standard for radiation exposure to personnel {{was the same as}} that used by the Manhattan Project: 0.1 roentgens per day. Because of this constraint, only the five most distant target ships could be boarded on the first day. The closer-in ships were hosed down by Navy fireboats using saltwater and flame retardants. The first hosing reduced radioactivity by half, but subsequent hosings were ineffective. For most of the ships, reboarding had to wait until the short-lived radioisotopes decayed; ten days elapsed before the last of the targets could be boarded.|$|E
5|$|A diatom floristic {{study of}} <b>the</b> <b>lagoon</b> {{revealed}} that it contains 41 species {{and is a}} rich storehouse of psychrophilic photosynthetic bacteria. The heterotrophic bacterial microbiota and the ecology of photosynthetic bacteria of the Lake Burton were studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters and that the environmental conditions, presence of light in summer, darkness during winter, and oxic and anoxic water status of the lake waters dictated the growth of bacterial phototrophs.|$|E
5|$|During {{its opening}} weekend at <b>the</b> <b>Lagoon</b> Cinema in Minneapolis, Into Temptation sold more tickets {{in three days}} than any other film during its debut weekend, and sold twice the tickets of such major studio films as Taking Woodstock and Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds. This {{resulted}} in an extended run and strong word-of-mouth that led to exhibitions in other cities. The film earned a total of $97,457 in gross revenue in the United States. The Into Temptation DVD was released on October 27, 2009, with no bonus features.|$|E

50|$|Further {{south in}} Cook County, {{much of the}} river basin was {{acquired}} by the Forest Preserve District of Cook County in the early 20th century and then, in the 1930s, landscaped by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) into <b>the</b> Skokie <b>Lagoons</b> Forest Preserve. For a time, <b>the</b> Skokie <b>Lagoons</b> project utilized ten separate CCC companies, making <b>the</b> <b>lagoons</b> <b>the</b> largest CCC project in the United States. The wetlands were dredged and replaced with seven artificial lagoons as much as 16 feet (5 m) deep, in line with pastoral landscape appreciation patterns of <b>the</b> time. <b>The</b> <b>lagoons</b> cover 190 acres (0.8 km²) in area. The Forest Preserve District took some limited actions in the 1990s to alter some of <b>the</b> <b>lagoons</b> and try to restore a vestige of the original Skokie River wetland terrain.|$|R
5|$|The Baker {{explosion}} ejected {{into the}} environment about twice as many free neutrons as there were fission events. A plutonium fission event produces, on average, 2.9 neutrons, {{most of which are}} consumed in the production of more fission, until fission falls off and the remaining uncaptured neutrons escape. In an air burst, most of these environmental neutrons are absorbed by superheated air which rises into the stratosphere, along with the fission products and unfissioned plutonium. In the underwater Baker detonation, the neutrons were captured by seawater in <b>the</b> <b>lagoon.</b>|$|E
5|$|The tourism {{industry}} {{is also a}} mainstay for communities on <b>the</b> <b>lagoon.</b> Beach-goers must pass the Laguna Madre to reach the prime beaching destination at both North and South Padre Islands.

Visitors also flock to Bird Island off the western coast of Padre Island, for windsurfing, kayaking, and other water sports.|$|E
5|$|A {{percentage}} {{of each group}} working in less contaminated areas was badged. Eventually, 18,875 film-badge dosimeters were issued to about 15% of the total work force. On {{the basis of this}} sampling, a theoretical total exposure was calculated for each person who did not have a personal badge. As expected, exposures for target ship crewmen who reboarded their ships after Baker were higher than those for support ship crews. The hulls of support ships that entered <b>the</b> <b>lagoon</b> after Baker became so radioactive that sleeping quarters were moved toward the center of each ship. Of the total mass of radioactive particles scattered by each explosion, 85% was unfissioned plutonium which produces alpha radiation not detected by film badges or Geiger counters. There was no method of detecting plutonium in a timely fashion, and participants were not monitored for ingestion of it.|$|E

5|$|A {{week later}} with the skies clearing, birds began to appear, {{signalling}} a proximity to land. On 28 May, the Great Barrier Reef was sighted; Bligh found a navigable gap and sailed the launch into a calm lagoon. Late that afternoon, he ran the boat ashore on a small island which he named Restoration Island, where the men found oysters and berries in plentiful supply {{and were able to}} eat ravenously. Over the next four days, the party island-hopped northward within <b>the</b> <b>lagoon,</b> aware that their movements were being closely monitored by natives on the mainland. Strains were showing within the party; following a heated disagreement with Purcell, Bligh grabbed a cutlass and challenged the carpenter to fight. Fryer told Cole to arrest their captain, but backed down after Bligh threatened to kill him if he interfered.|$|E
5|$|All {{that is left}} of Missouri Row is a four-sided {{concrete}} fireplace {{surrounded by}} pieces of foundation, a few sets of stairs, metal plumbing, and a retaining wall. East of that, surrounding {{what is now the}} Monte Ne boat launch, are remnants of limestone structures. Some of these are foundations from the broad wooden staircase built in front of Hotel Monte Ne; some are structural components for the twin stone bridges that crossed <b>the</b> <b>lagoon</b> and some are simply low retaining walls. The amphitheater and the retaining wall built for the Pyramid are underwater. Occasionally, when water levels drop in summer, they can be seen.|$|E
5|$|Group D, finally, was {{tasked with}} {{advancing}} south from its landing point to close off an escape route that ran between {{the sea and}} an inland lagoon towards the city of Hué. Landing at 04:30, the group made quick progress through the beach and dunes, secured the small city of Thé Chi Dong and hit the north coast of <b>the</b> <b>lagoon</b> by 05:30, thereby sealing off that escape route with no enemy contact. The final act of sealing the noose was to move some of the French Navy vessels north to the Vietnamese villages of Ba-Lang and An-Hoi where any attempt by Regiment 95 to flee by sea would have taken place.|$|E
40|$|Sediment properties, microphytobenthos biomass (chlorophyll a and phaeopigments), and the {{structure}} of the benthic communities of <b>the</b> three main <b>lagoons</b> (Mirim, Imaruí and Santo Antonio) of the Laguna Estuarine System, South Brazil, were analyzed during summer and winter. Microphytobenthos biomass did not differ significantly among <b>the</b> <b>lagoons,</b> but showed higher values in the summer. The macrofauna was characterized by low species richness and the dominance of the gastropod Heleobia australis, the tanaidean Kalliapseudes schubartti and the bivalve Erodona mactroides. The meiofauna was composed of 20 higher taxa and the nematodes dominated in all <b>the</b> <b>lagoons</b> and periods. Desmodora (Desmodora) sp. 1, Terschllingia sp. and Microlaimus sp. were numerically the most important among the 74 nematode species registered. This study showed that, in the Laguna Estuarine System, differences in <b>the</b> benthos among <b>lagoons</b> and periods were dependent on the fauna component analyzed. Whilst macrofauna and nematodes were significantly more diverse in the inner stations, in <b>the</b> Mirim <b>Lagoon,</b> <b>the</b> number of meiofauna taxa did not differ significantly among <b>the</b> <b>lagoons</b> and <b>the</b> diversity and evenness were highest in Santo Antonio. These results were a response of the fauna to the salinity oscillations coupled with the heterogeneity of the sediment in <b>the</b> <b>lagoons.</b> <b>The</b> temporal variability of the fauna, macrofauna being more abundant in the summer and meiofauna in the winter, could be related to the different life strategies of these groups...|$|R
