5|$|At {{the end of}} the English Civil War Lady Drake {{was joined}} at her Devon home, Ash House in the parish of Musbury, by her fourth {{daughter}} Elizabeth Drake and her husband Winston Churchill (1620–1688), a Royalist cavalry captain. Unlike his mother-in-law who had supported the Parliamentary cause, Winston had the misfortune of fighting on <b>the</b> <b>losing</b> <b>side</b> of the war – for which he, like so many other Cavaliers, was forced to compound; in his case £446 18s. Although Winston had paid off the fine by 1651, it had impoverished him. From this episode may derive the Churchill family motto: Fiel Pero Desdichado ("Faithful but Unfortunate").|$|E
5|$|Between 1912 and 1918, Bulgaria became {{involved}} in three consecutive conflicts—two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on <b>the</b> <b>losing</b> <b>side</b> {{as a result of}} its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories, at Doiran and Dobrich, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses, and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929 due to the effects of these wars, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{entered the}} 2000 college {{football}} season with hopes of following up its {{victory in the}} 2000 Sugar Bowl with another national championship. The Seminoles' regular-season performance differed slightly from 1999, as they lost a regular-season game to Miami, yet still appeared in a third consecutive national championship game: the 2001 Orange Bowl. Unlike in 2000, the Seminoles emerged on <b>the</b> <b>losing</b> <b>side</b> of a 132 score. Virginia Tech, like Florida State, had hoped to attend the national championship game again, but an injury to star quarterback Michael Vick caused the Hokies to lose a regular-season game at third-ranked Miami, eliminating them from national championship contention.|$|E

5|$|Geoffrey and Maud's oldest granddaughter, Joan, married Roger Mortimer in 1301, giving Mortimer {{control of}} Ludlow Castle. Around 1320, Roger built the Great Chamber block {{alongside}} the existing Great Hall and Solar complex, copying what {{was becoming a}} popular tripartite design for domestic castle buildings in the 14th century; an additional building was also constructed by Roger on {{the location of the}} later Tudor Lodgings, and the Guardrobe Tower was added to the curtain wall. Between 1321 and 1322 Mortimer found himself on <b>the</b> <b>losing</b> <b>side</b> of the Despenser War and, after being imprisoned by Edward II, he escaped from the Tower of London in 1323 into exile.|$|E

5|$|In Globe, Arizona, Burnham unwittingly joined <b>the</b> <b>losing</b> <b>side</b> of the Pleasant Valley War before {{mass killing}} started, and only {{narrowly}} escaped death. He had no {{stake in the}} feud, but he was drawn into the conflict by his association with the Gordon family. Once the killing started, {{he felt he had}} to join a faction as a hired gun, although it put him {{on the wrong side of}} the law. In between raids and forays, he practiced incessantly with his pistol; he learned to shoot using either hand and from the back of a galloping horse. Even after his faction admitted defeat (the feud would begin again years later), Burnham still had many enemies.|$|E

As expected Figueres won by a landslide victory.|$|R

Davis {{in high school}} was 23–0 with a 1.85 ERA and was the Arizona High School Pitcher of the Year, and in college he had a 2.25 ERA as a pitcher. Against the Angels he threw his fastball as high as 88 miles per hour, threw a slider in the high 70s, and threw a cutter. It {{was the first time}} the A’s had a position player pitch since Frank Menechino in 2000.|$|E
5|$|R.C. MacLeod {{wrote of}} another {{tradition}} which {{stated that the}} flag was waved at a battle in Waternish, in about 1580; and of another which told of how it was waved {{during a time when}} a cattle plague was raging, and that it stopped the murrain. R.C. MacLeod stated his belief that the flag would only have been waved twice, and so rejected the tradition of it being unfurled at the Battle of Bloody Bay—because the MacLeods were on <b>the</b> <b>losing</b> <b>side!</b> R.C. MacLeod also wondered if it had been waved in 1600, when the clan was in a desperate state in the midst of warring with the Macdonalds of Sleat.|$|E
5|$|Stan Collymore, Fowler's strike partner from 1995–97, {{said in his}} {{autobiography}} that Fowler was the best player he has ever played alongside. Fowler and Collymore {{were among the most}} prolific goal-scoring strike partnerships in England during the 1995–96 season. In the same season he scored twice in a 4–3 victory over Newcastle United, a match voted the best of the decade in a Premier League poll. The match helped prevent Newcastle from winning the league, but it was not enough for Liverpool to clinch the title; they finished third while Manchester United were crowned champions. Fowler also played in his first FA Cup final that season, but was on <b>the</b> <b>losing</b> <b>side</b> as Manchester United won 1–0.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the second}} half of the 20th century, English and Scottish {{football}} fans began to regularly sing a song based on this tune using the words We'll support you evermore which in turn led to many different versions being adapted. Currently, in 2016, the variation [...] "You're Not Singing Anymore" [...] when taunting the fans of opposing teams who were on <b>the</b> <b>losing</b> <b>sides</b> remains extremely popular.

5|$|After a tag team match, {{which they}} lost, on the August 19 episode of SmackDown, Fox was {{attacked}} by Natalya, which provoked a feud between the two.

As part of the storyline, Fox also prevented Natalya and Phoenix from attacking other Divas, including Kelly Kelly and AJ.
