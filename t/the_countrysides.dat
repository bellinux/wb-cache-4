25|$|In April 1885, a {{horde of}} Protestant missionaries began to flood into Joseon. The Isolationists were horrified and {{realized}} they had finally been defeated by the Queen Consort. The doors to Korea were not only open to ideas, technology, and culture but also to other religions. Having lost immense power with Heungseon Daewongun (still captive in China), the Isolationists could do nothing but simply watch. Horace Grant Underwood and his wife, William B. Scranton, his wife, and his mother, Mary Scranton, made Korea their new home in May 1885. They established churches within Seoul and began to establish centers in <b>the</b> <b>countrysides.</b> Catholic missionaries arrived soon afterwards, reviving Catholicism which had witnessed massive persecution in 1866 under Heungseon Daewongun's rule.|$|E
25|$|In early October 1483 Sultan Bayezid II sent a large Ottoman {{force of}} around 7000 Akıncı, led by Harsi Pasha and Serli Hasan, that crossed the Una and Sava rivers and broke into Croatia. The most {{affected}} areas were <b>the</b> <b>countrysides</b> of Jastrebarsko and Petrovina. Their army was split into 3 parts, each going its own course, with one continuing towards Carniola and Carinthia on 16 October. Matthias Gereb, {{who became the}} Ban of Croatia that year, was informed about the raid, but he was lacking the forces to confront the Ottomans. Therefore, he started assembling an army with the Croatian nobles; Count Bernardin Frankopan, Ivan Frankopan Cetinski, Mihovil Frankopan Slunjski, Petar Zrinski and ban deputy Gašpar Perušić, who were later joined by Despot of Serbia Vuk Grgurević and Blaise Magyar. A part of the Croatian cavalry was sent to track the Ottomans on distance and if an opportunity comes up to intercept them.|$|E

500|$|The Rus' {{attacked}} in the Gorgan region around Abaskun, {{as well as}} Tabaristan, pillaging <b>the</b> <b>countrysides</b> as they went. [...] An attempt to repel them as they lay in anchor near islands in the southwestern part of the Caspian Sea proved unsuccessful; and they were then able to roam and raid at will. Across the sea they raided at Baku, penetrating inland a distance of three days' journey, and plundering the regions of Arran, Tabaristan, Beylagan, and Shirvan. Everywhere they looted {{as much as they}} could, taking women and children as slaves. The news of their outrages preceded them as they headed homeward and, in the Volga Delta, the Rus' were attacked by Khazars, as well as by some Christians, apparently with the acquiescence of the Khazar ruler. According to al-Masudi, those who escaped were finished off by the Burtas and Volga Bulgars.|$|E

You do not see the word [...] "Asia" [...] written across a map of that neighbourhood; nor do you see the word [...] "Thief" [...] written across <b>the</b> <b>countrysides</b> of England; though it is really written in equally large letters. I know men governing despotically great stretches of that country, whose every step in life has been such that a slip would have sent them to Dartmoor; but they trod along the high hard wall between right and wrong, the wall as sharp as a swordedge, as softly and craftily and lightly as a cat. The vastness of their silent violence itself obscured what they were at; if they seem to stand for the rights of property it is really because they have so often invaded them. And if they do not break the laws, it is only because they make them.|$|E

40|$|Original title: Leven zonder drukte. <b>The</b> Dutch <b>countryside</b> is {{no longer}} {{predominantly}} farmland; a shift is taking place from an agricultural towards a more consumptive use of the land.
