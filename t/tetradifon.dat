40|$|Stir bar sorptive {{extraction}} (SBSE) {{in combination}} with GC-ECD/FPD analysis is here applied to {{the determination of the}} residues of 11 pesticides (hexachlorobenzene, lindane, chlorothalonil, parathion methyl, parathion ethyl, fenitrothion, malathion, dieldrin, α- and β-endosulfan, and <b>tetradifon)</b> in herbal teas prepared with Passiflora alata Dryander spiked leaves. The method was optimized using spiked herbal teas in a range from 0. 05 to 1 pg/μL for organochlorine pesticides and from 0. 15 to 3 pg/μL for organophosphorus pesticides. The method is reproducible and repeatable with recoveries calculated from herbal teas prepared with spiked plant material versus spiked herbal teas, varying from about 30 % for <b>tetradifon</b> to about 90 % for parathion methyl and malathion. The limits of quantitation (LOQs) ranged from 0. 017 pg/μL for lindane to 0. 117 pg/μL for malathion. Articl...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tetradifon,</b> a {{potentially}} carcinogenic and mutagenic pesticide, {{can contribute to}} environmental and human contamination when applied to green bell pepper crops. In this context, in this work, a reliable and sensitive method for determination of <b>tetradifon</b> in Brazilian green bell pepper samples involving a differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique on a glassy carbon electrode is proposed. The electrochemical behavior of <b>tetradifon</b> as followed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) suggests that its reduction occurs via an irreversible five-electron transfer vs. Ag vertical bar AgCl, KCl 3 M reference electrode. Very well-resolved diffusion controlled voltammetric peaks have been obtained in a supporting electrolyte solution composed of a mixture of 40 % dimethylformamide (DMF), 30 % methanol, and 30 % NaOH 0. 3 mol L- 1 at - 1. 43, - 1. 57, - 1. 73, - 1. 88, and - 2. 05 V. The proposed DPV method has a good linear response in the 3. 00 - 10. 0 mu mol L- 1 range, with a limit of detection (L. O. D) of 0. 756 mu mol L- 1 and 0. 831 mu mol L- 1 in the absence and {{in the presence of}} the matrix, respectively. Moreover, improved L. O. D results (0. 607 mu mol L- 1) have been achieved in the absence of DMF from the supporting electrolyte solution. Recovery has been evaluated in five commercial green bell pepper samples, and recovery percentages ranging from 91. 0 to 109 have been obtained for <b>tetradifon</b> determinations. The proposed voltammetric method has also been tested for reproducibility, repeatability, and potential interferents, and the results obtained for these three analytical parameters are satisfactory for electroanalytical purposes.

40|$|The {{predatory mite}} Euseius alatus DeLeon has been {{reported}} in several economic crops in Brazil, with certified importance in fruit trees and coffee. In order to establish an integrated pest management program it is important to determine the efficient pesticides in pests control, but presenting low impact to predators. This work had the objective of evaluating the toxicity of acaricides (abamectin, azocyclotin, diafenthiuron, dicofol, sulphur, fenpropathrin, fenpyroximate, propargite, <b>tetradifon)</b> to eggs and adult females of E. alatus. Leaf discs of "feijão de porco" (Canavalia ensiformes L.) containing 10 eggs of E. alatus were immersed into the acaricides dilutions, during five seconds, and dried for 30 minutes under room temperature. Treated eggs were observed up to 72 h to determine egg survival. The residual effect of the same acaricides to adult females of E. alatus was studied using arena constituted by treated leaf disc. Ten adult females were confined per arena, 30 minutes, 24 h and 72 h after immersing the discs into the acaricides dilutions. Mortality was measured 24, 48 and 72 h after confining the females on the treated leaf discs. All tested acaricides showed low impact on egg survival, except for fenpropathrin that caused reduction of egg survival at rate of 66 %. The acaricides azocyclotin, diafenthiuron, <b>tetradifon</b> and abamectin caused 100 % of mortality to adult females. Otherwise, diafenthiuron (500 g de a. i. /Kg), fenpyroximate (50 g de a. i. /L), propargite (720 g de a. i. /L) and <b>tetradifon</b> (80 g de a. i. /L) caused lower impact to adult females of E. alatus and, therefore, being of potential recommendation into an integrated pest management...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{determination}} of some pesticide residues in must and wine samples was developed using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography – electron capture detection (GC/ECD). The procedure only needs dilution as sample pre-treatment and is therefore simple, fast and solvent-free. Eight fungicides (vinclozolin, procymidone, iprodione, penconazole, fenarimol, folpet, nuarimol and hexaconazole), one insecticide (chlorpyriphos) and two acaricides (bromopropylate and <b>tetradifon)</b> can be quantified. Good linearity was observed for all the compounds in the range 5 – 100 µg/L. The reproducibility of the measurements was found acceptable (with RSD’s below 20 %). Detection limits of 11 µg/L, on average, are sufficiently below the proposed maximum residue limits (MRL’s) for these compounds in wine. The analytical method was applied to {{the determination of}} these compounds in Portuguese must and wine samples from the Demarcated Region of Alentejo, where any residues could be detected...|$|E
40|$|Natural peat {{was tested}} for {{solid-phase}} extraction of acephate, chlorpropham, pirimicarb, bifenthrin, <b>tetradifon</b> and phosalone from the medicinal plant Cordia salicifolia, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with {{selected ion monitoring}} (GC/MS, SIM). Considering {{that there are no}} Brazilian regulations concerning maximum permissible pesticide residue concentrations in medicinal herbs, recovery experiments were carried out (three replicates) at two arbitrary fortification levels (0. 5 and 1. 0 mg kg- 1), resulting in recoveries ranging from 64 % to 118 % and relative standard deviations between 5. 6 % and 26. 4 % for peat sorbent. Detection and quantification limits for herb ranged from 0. 10 to 0. 15 mg kg- 1 and from 0. 15 to 0. 25 mg kg- 1, respectively, for the different pesticides studied. The developed method was linear over the range assayed, 0. 1 - 5. 0 &# 956;g g- 1, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 9975 to 0. 9986 for all pesticides. Comparison between natural peat and conventional sorbent (neutral alumina) showed similar performance of peat for the six pesticides tested...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop and}} test a general {{modeling}} framework {{to describe the}} sublethal effects of pollutants by adding toxicity modules to an established dynamic energy budget (DEB) model. The DEB model describes the rates of energy acquisition and expenditure by individual organisms; the toxicity modules describe how toxicants affect these rates by changing the value {{of one or more}} DEB parameters, notably the parameters quantifying the rates of feeding and maintenance. We investigate four toxicity modules that assume: (1) effects on feeding only; (2) effects on maintenance only; (3) effects on feeding and maintenance with similar values for the toxicity parameters; and (4) effects on feeding and maintenance with different values for the toxicity parameters. We test the toxicity modules by fitting each to published data on feeding, respiration, growth and reproduction. Among the pollutants tested are metals (mercury and copper) and various organic compounds (chlorophenols, toluene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, <b>tetradifon</b> and pyridine); organisms include mussels, oysters, earthworms, water fleas and zebrafish. In most cases, the data sets could be adequately described with any of the toxicity modules, and no single module gave superior fits to all data sets. We therefore propose that for many applications, it is reasonable to use the most general and parameter sparse module, i. e. module 3 that assumes similar effects on feeding and maintenance, as a default. For one example (water fleas), we use parameter estimates to calculate the impact of food availability and toxicant levels on the long term population growth rate...|$|E
40|$|A simple microwave-assisted {{extraction}} and partitioning method (MAEP) using water-acetonitrile and n-hexane for desorption and simultaneous partitioning, respectively, {{together with}} gas chromatography (GC) was studied to determine representative pesticides (trifluralin, metolachlor, chlorpyriphos and triadimefon) {{with a broad}} range of physico-chemical properties in agricultural soils. Three points were considered crucial in this study: instrumental and sample-associated factors affecting extraction of the target compounds were studied through experimental design; the spiking procedure at trace levels was carried out to reproduce the solute-soil sorption taking place in the environment as closely as possible; and results were analyzed taking into account the adsorption behaviour of the compounds on different kinds of soils. The complete analytical procedure proposed consisted of the MAEP of pesticides from 1. 0 g of soil with 1 mL of 1 : 1 water/acetonitrile mixture, and 5 mL of hexane for trapping. The microwave heating program applied was 2 min at 250 W and 10 min at 900 W, and 130 degrees C maximum temperature. After extraction, the hexane layer was evaporated to dryness; the residue was re-dissolved and directly analyzed by gas chromatography electron capture detection (GC-ECD). Clean chromatograms were obtained without any additional cleanup step. Besides the four pesticides used to optimise MAEP, the method was applied to determine an additional group of pesticides (triallate, acetochlor, alachlor, endosulphan I and II, endrin, methoxychlor and <b>tetradifon)</b> in different soils. Most of the compounds studied were recovered in good yields with relative standard deviations (R. S. D. s) below 9 % and detection limits ranged from 0. 004 to 0. 036 mu g g(- 1). The described method is efficient and fast to determine hydrophobic pesticides at ng g(- 1) level in soil with different clay-to-organic matter ratios...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{commercial}} acaricides {{were evaluated}} in date palm plantations in Al-Gassim, Saudi Arabia, against the date mite Oligonychus afrasiaticus (McGregor). Neoron (bromopropylate 25 % EC), Kelthane (dicofol 18. 5 % EC), Tedion (<b>tetradifon</b> 75. 2 g L - 1), Top Cop (73 % S + 6. 4 % Cu, w/v), Microthiol Special (Sulfur 80 % WP, Ekatin (thiometon 25 % EC), were applied in sites 1 and 2. Peropal (azocyclotin 25 % WP) and Transact (abamectin 1. 8 % EC), {{in addition to}} Kelthane, Tedion and Neoron were used in site 3. Based on the percentage of web formation on date bunches all treatments, except Ekatin, reduced mite infestations significantly below that of the untreated check by the 7 th, 27 th and 21 st days after treatment (DAT) in sites 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Kelthane and Neoron significantly reduced mite infestation in the 3 sites after the second week from application and continued until the termination of the experiment. The effect of Microthiol Special was excellent until 35 DAT in site 1, when it gradually declined {{up to the end}} of the trial. Top Cop`s action was clear from week 3, however, it declined from the 5 th week in site 1. Ekatin knocked down initial infestations in both sites but rapid build up of infestation was observed in 13 and 28 DAT in sites 2 and 1, respectively. Best control obtained in site 3 was in the Neoron, Kelthane and Transact treatments, followed by Peropal and Tedion whose effect did not sustain to the end. The overall performance of the acaricides, determined according to their ability to reduce the mite infestation, compared to the control throughout the experiment, was 96. 8, 96. 3, 95. 2, 83. 8, 81. 7, 80. 6, 79. 0 and 30. 2 %, for Transact, Kelthane, Neoron, Peropal, Tedion, Microthiol, Top Cop and Ekatin, respectively. No significant differences were found in date weights between treatments...|$|E
