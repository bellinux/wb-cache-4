40|$|An incentive-compatibility {{framework}} for regulating a monopolist with unknown costs {{is applied to}} <b>the</b> <b>sponsor’s</b> problem of monitoring a bureau. Following Mueller (1989), the bureau does not make take-it-or-leave-it budget proposals to <b>the</b> <b>sponsor.</b> Rather, <b>the</b> bureau must announce a marginal cost per unit of output to <b>the</b> <b>sponsor.</b> Given that report, <b>the</b> <b>sponsor</b> chooses a price that it will pay to the bureau for each unit of output, and <b>the</b> <b>sponsor</b> chooses <b>the</b> level of output as well.

40|$|A company (sponsor) {{establishes}} a leveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) {{in which the}} ESOP borrows funds from a bank or other lender. <b>The</b> <b>sponsor</b> may guarantee {{some or all of}} the debt or otherwise formally commit to the creditor to make future contributions to the ESOP sufficient to meet the debt service requirements. Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>sponsor</b> may provide no guarantee of debt repayment or formal commitment to make future contributions.

When rewriting one of the programs, Gork: Son of Fire, Roger attempts to write the script with self-referential events, proving to everyone that the mysterious killer is actually sound engineer Max Applewhite. Max explains that his killings were a revenge scheme that dealt with stock holders and patents, specifically detailing his invention of television, which other scientists have copied. Roger and Penny are taken by Max atop the radio tower at gunpoint. Max is eventually killed when a biplane shows up and guns him down. Impressed by the nightly performance, <b>the</b> <b>sponsors</b> decide to fund WBN. Roger and Penny reconcile their complex relationship and decide not to divorce.|$|E
5|$|As the 1990s began, Pei transitioned into a role of {{decreased}} {{involvement with}} his firm.

Before he made this change, however, he set {{to work on his}} last major project as active partner: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. Considering his work on such bastions of high culture as the Louvre and US National Gallery, some critics were surprised by his association with what many considered a tribute to low culture. <b>The</b> <b>sponsors</b> of the hall, however, sought Pei for specifically this reason; they wanted the building to have an aura of respectability from the beginning.

5|$|Beginning work in 2011, the TIRC has {{referred}} 17 cases to {{the circuit court}} for judicial review for potential relief. Three convicts have been freed based on review of their cases. Individuals may initiate claims to the commission. As of April 2016, another 130 cases have been heard of torture that was not committed by Burge or his subordinates.

5|$|Andrée {{resisted}} Ekholm's criticisms to {{the point}} of deception. On the boat back from Svalbard, Ekholm learned from the chief engineer of the hydrogen plant the explanation of some anomalies he had noticed in his measurements: Andrée had from time to time secretly ordered extra topping-up of the hydrogen in the balloon. Andrée's motives for such self-destructive behavior are not known. Several modern writers, following Sundman's Andrée portrait in the semi-documentary novel, The Flight of the Eagle (1967), have speculated that Andrée had by this time become the prisoner of his own successful funding campaign. <b>The</b> <b>sponsors</b> and the media followed every delay and reported on every setback, and were clamoring for results. Andrée, Strindberg, and Ekholm had been seen off by cheering crowds in Stockholm and Gothenburg (see image from Aftonbladet, right), and now all the expectations were coming to nothing with the long wait for southerly winds at Danes Island. Especially pointed was the contrast between Nansen's simultaneous return, covered in polar glory from his daring yet well-planned expedition on the ship Fram, and Andrée's failure even to launch his own much-hyped conveyance. Sundman theorizes that Andrée could not face letting the press report {{that he did not know}} the prevailing wind direction, and had also miscalculated in ordering the balloon, and needed a new one to rectify his error.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 {{the state}} {{passed a law}} authorizing the Illinois Torture Inquiry Relief Commission, to {{investigate}} cases related to convictions of people claiming to have been tortured by Burge and his officers and given coerced confessions, {{to see if there}} was evidence for judicial review and relief. It started to receive cases in 2011. Seventeen cases have been referred to the circuit court and three men freed by April 2016. Another 130 similar cases of torture by Chicago police have been claimed, beyond the scope of Burge and his cohort. <b>The</b> <b>sponsors</b> are trying to have the bill amended to accommodate these victims. In 2015 the City of Chicago announced that it has established a $5.5 million fund for reparations to victims of torture by Burge, and to aid their families. By that time, the city had paid more than $57 million to victims of Burge and his cohort, and another $50 million for defense of the officers.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{whether the}} timing of {{sponsorship}} disclosure affects viewers’ processing of sponsored content, and whether a disclosure influences the persuasive effect of <b>the</b> <b>sponsored</b> content. A model is proposed in which sponsorship disclosure enhances <b>the</b> recognition of <b>sponsored</b> television content as advertising, which leads to critical processing of <b>the</b> <b>sponsored</b> content. Ultimately, this negatively affects the attitude toward the brand in <b>the</b> <b>sponsored</b> content. This model was supported, but only when the disclosure was displayed prior to or concurrent with <b>the</b> <b>sponsored</b> content. These effects were not found for a sponsorship disclosure shown {{at the end of}} the program after <b>the</b> <b>sponsored</b> content. Theoretically, <b>the</b> findings emphasize the importance of disclosure timing. A disclosure displayed prior to or concurrent with <b>the</b> <b>sponsored</b> content, primes <b>the</b> <b>sponsored</b> content and provides sufficient processing time, so viewers recognize the content as advertising and can process it critically. In addition, the findings show that persuasion knowledge and critical processing are important underlying mechanisms for the effect of sponsorship disclosure on brand attitude. Regarding the practical implications for legislators and advertisers, this research demonstrates that sponsorship disclosure can make viewers aware of <b>the</b> <b>sponsored</b> content in television programs. Furthermore, this changes <b>the</b> processing of <b>sponsored</b> content and can also ultimately lead to resistance against persuasion...|$|R

5|$|Mary {{was born}} on 18 February 1516 at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich, London. She was {{the only child of}} King Henry VIII by his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, to survive infancy. Her mother had many miscarriages; before Mary's birth, four {{previous}} pregnancies had resulted in a stillborn daughter and three short-lived or stillborn sons, including Henry, Duke of Cornwall. She was baptised into the Catholic faith at the Church of the Observant Friars in Greenwich three days after her birth. Her godparents included her great-aunt the Countess of Devon, Lord Chancellor Thomas Wolsey, and the Duchess of Norfolk. Henry VIII's cousin once removed, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, stood sponsor for Mary's confirmation, which was held immediately after the baptism. The following year, Mary became a godmother herself when she was named as one of <b>the</b> <b>sponsors</b> of her cousin Frances Brandon. In 1520, the Countess of Salisbury was appointed Mary's governess. Sir John Hussey, later Lord Hussey, was her chamberlain from 1530, and his wife, Lady Anne, daughter of George Grey, 2nd Earl of Kent, was one of Mary's attendants.|$|E
5|$|The Norman conquest {{introduced}} northern French artistic styles, {{particular in}} illuminated manuscripts and murals, {{and reduced the}} demand for carvings. In other artistic areas, including embroidery, the Anglo-Saxon influence remained evident into the 12th century, and the famous Bayeux Tapestry {{is an example of}} older styles being reemployed under the new regime. Stained glass became a distinctive form of English art during this later medieval period, although the coloured glass for these works was almost entirely imported from Europe. Little early stained glass in England has survived, but it typically had both an ornamental and educational function, while later works also commemorated <b>the</b> <b>sponsors</b> of the windows into the designs. English tapestry making and embroidery in the early 14th century were of an especially high quality; works produced by nuns and London professionals were exported across Europe, becoming known as the opus anglicanum. English illuminated books, such as the Queen Mary Psalter, were also famous in this period, featuring rich decoration, a combination of grotesque and natural figures and rich colours. The quality of illuminated art in England declined significantly in the face of competition from Flanders in the 14th century, and later English illuminated medieval pieces generally imitated Flemish styles.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{assesses the}} {{generalizability}} of Speed and Thompson’s (2000) model of the determinants of sponsorship response to an important and growing market for sponsorship (China). It extends the model by considering differences in effects for foreign and domestically owned <b>sponsors</b> and <b>the</b> role of patriotism. The findings confirm that personal liking for <b>the</b> <b>sponsored</b> event, status of the event, attitude to <b>the</b> <b>sponsor,</b> perceived sincerity of <b>the</b> <b>sponsor</b> and perceived fit between <b>the</b> <b>sponsor</b> and <b>the</b> event are significant factors underpinning positive responses. In contrast to Speed and Thompson (2000), ubiquity of <b>the</b> <b>sponsor</b> is not significant for China. Whether <b>the</b> <b>sponsor</b> is of domestic or foreign origin is identified as an important moderator of sponsorship effects {{but there is no}} consistent evidence that foreign sponsors suffer from relatively poorer outcomes in emerging markets compared to domestically owned rivals...|$|R
