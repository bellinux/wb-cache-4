40|$|Background and Aim: A common {{complaint}} {{of children with}} learning disability (LD) is difficulty in understanding speech {{in the presence of}} background noise. Evidence from animal and human studies has indicated that the medial olivocochlear bundle (MOCB) play a role in hearing in the presence of noise. The MOCB function can be evaluated by <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> click evoked otoacoustic emission (CEOAEs) in response to contralateral white noise. The present study was conducted to compare <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> effect <b>of</b> CEOAEs between LD and normal students. Materials and Method: This research is an analytic-interventional study. The study group consisted of 20 learning disabled and 20 normal male students. <b>The</b> <b>suppression</b> effect <b>of</b> CEOAEs was evaluated by a comparison between CEOAEs levels in two conditions- with and without presentation of contralateral white noise. Results: In the absence of noise {{there was no significant difference}} between CEOAEs amplitudes of two groups while there was significant difference between CEOAEs of two groups in the presence <b>of</b> noise. <b>The</b> <b>suppression</b> effect <b>of</b> CEOAEs in normal students had significant difference with LD students. Conclusion: <b>The</b> reduced <b>suppression</b> effect in LD students indicates the reduced activity of the MOCB function and efferent pathway in LD students which affect their ability to hear in the presence of background noise. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> effect <b>of</b> CEOAEs can be used in the test battery approach of LD children...|$|R
5|$|About {{two hours}} later, it became {{apparent}} that the badly coordinated uprising had failed, as the remaining 550 native soldiers refused to participate in the mutiny, instead helping to quell the rebellion. Some went into the town to protect French civilians and office buildings from attack. Three Vietnamese sergeants were subsequently awarded the Médaille militaire for their role in <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> the mutiny, while six other tirailleurs received the Croix de Guerre. The attack initially generated confusion among the French administration. It was widely reported by the French media in Vietnam and Europe that the Indochinese Communist Party had organised the uprising.|$|E

In July of that year, while assigned to the East Asia Division, Bussard and Falke assisted in <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> Mata'afa Iosefo's revolt in Samoa, along with a British corvette.

Cormoran participated in the seizure of the Kiautschou Bay concession in China in 1897, and Falke was involved in the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–03.

5|$|Around 1920, Petrov was {{transferred}} to Central Asia and fought in <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> the Basmachi movement, a Muslim uprising against Russian and Soviet rule.

In 1932, he graduated from the armored commanders refresher courses. Petrov served as the commander of a training battalion in the 1st Mechanized Brigade, before fighting in the Spanish Civil War, serving as a battalion commander in Dmitry Pavlov's tank brigade from October 1936 to June 1937. He was awarded the Order of the Red Star on 2 January 1937. On 21 June he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin for his leadership. Returning to the Soviet Union, he held appointments as a battalion commander and then as a tank brigade commander. In 1937, he became commander of a tank division. In June of that year, he became commander of the 5th Mechanized Corps.|$|E

This was quickly achieved and his brother, Theophilos Kourkouas, replaced Boilas as governor of Chaldia. As commander of this northernmost sector of the eastern frontier, Theophilos proved a competent soldier and gave valuable assistance to his brother's campaigns.|$|E
