5|$|Against long-circulating speculations {{that his}} family has French roots, genealogists proved the German origin of Rockefeller and traced <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early 17th century. Thereupon Johann Peter Rockenfeller (baptized 27 September 1682 in the Protestant church of Rengsdorf) immigrated in 1723 from Altwied (today a {{district}} of Neuwied, Rhineland-Palatinate) with three children to North America and settled down in Germantown, Pennsylvania.|$|E

Although Money Inc. received several rematches, they were unable to win the belts back from the Steiners.|$|E
5|$|Some larvae, {{especially}} those of the Lycaenidae, form mutual associations with ants. They communicate with the ants using vibrations that are transmitted through the substrate as well as using chemical signals. The ants provide some degree of protection to these larvae and they in turn gather honeydew secretions. Large blue (Phengaris arion) caterpillars trick Myrmica ants into taking <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ant colony where they feed on the ant eggs and larvae in a parasitic relationship.|$|E

5|$|With Carltron's defeat, {{the monsters}} plaguing Evermore disappear, {{but the world}} itself grows unstable. The boy returns {{to each of the}} worlds to collect Ruffleberg's companions, taking <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> real world. In doing so, Evermore's {{destruction}} is averted and it continues to exist without them. After the credits roll, a final scene shows Professor Ruffleberg returning Carltron to his old task of cleaning the lab. Carltron grins and rubs his hands together, implying that he is not as docile as the professor believes.|$|E
5|$|After an oil {{drilling}} operation in 1903 in Dexter, Kansas, produced a gas geyser {{that would not}} burn, Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth collected samples of the escaping gas and took <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> University of Kansas at Lawrence where, {{with the help of}} chemists Hamilton Cady and David McFarland, he discovered that the gas consisted of, by volume, 72% nitrogen, 15% methane (a combustible percentage only with sufficient oxygen), 1% hydrogen, and 12% an unidentifiable gas. With further analysis, Cady and McFarland discovered that 1.84% of the gas sample was helium. This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas.|$|E

5|$|After {{their initial}} {{founding}} with one milk supplier, Beecher's production system {{has had to}} expand several times to include more suppliers. As of 2006, Beecher's {{was in the process}} of purchasing their own farms in Eastern Washington for additional milk production, which will also give them full control over their entire product's creation. The principal milk supplier is Green Acres Farm in Duvall, Washington, using only hormone-free and antibiotic-free milk. When consistent milk production first became a problem, Beecher's purchased a herd of 200 cows. The entire dairy herd at Green Acres Farm is owned by Beecher's, who leases <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> farm. For the New York production, all Holstein and Jersey milk come directly from Dutch Hollow Farms in upstate New York.|$|E

5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the fourth day, England set about extending their lead. Early in the innings, the capacity crowd encroached substantially onto the ground and the umpires spent eight minutes trying to force <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge of the official playing area, but they again spilled over. Initially, Hutton and Washbrook played cautiously to see off the new ball before trying to lift the run rate. Lindwall's first two overs were maidens, but Hutton and Washbrook scored 21 runs from his next five overs, while taking only five from Miller's six overs. The English batsmen attacked the bowling and reinforced their aggressive strokeplay with quick running. England reached lunch at 72/0 with Hutton on 40 and Washbrook on 28. Washbrook was particularly confident and Bradman decided to not risk Johnson in the morning session.|$|E

5|$|General McDowell then ordered Shelby and Clarke to take Musgrove's Mill, a British encampment on the Enoree River. They rode {{all night}} with two hundred men, {{reaching}} their location about dawn on August 18, 1780. The colonists had estimated the enemy force was of comparable size, but an advance scout brought word there were approximately 500 British soldiers in the camp who were preparing for battle. Shelby's men and horses were too tired for a retreat and they had lost the element of surprise. He ordered his men to construct a breastwork from nearby logs and brush. In half an hour the makeshift fortifications were complete, and twenty-five colonial riders charged the British camp to provoke the attack. The British pursued <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main colonial force. Despite being outnumbered, the colonists killed several British officers and put their army to flight.|$|E
5|$|Kidnapping is also {{a common}} theme in such folklore. Encantados {{are said to be}} fond of abducting humans with whom they fall in love, {{children}} born of their illicit love affairs, or just about anyone near the river who can keep them company, and taking <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Encante. The fear of this is so great among {{people who live in the}} Amazon river area that both children and adults are terrified of going near the water between dusk and dawn, or entering water-bodies alone. Some who supposedly have encountered encantados while out in their canoes have been said to have gone insane, although in fact, the creatures seem to have done little more than follow their boats and nudge them from time to time.|$|E
5|$|Maryland next {{traveled}} to South Carolina {{to face a}} team coming off of a four-game winning streak. Ralph Felton scored first to cap a long drive with a short rush. In the next series, the Gamecocks punted it away and the ball was returned by Hanulak 35 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, South Carolina recovered a Maryland fumble on the Terrapins' 14-yard line. In three plays, Maryland had pushed <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 32-yard line before South Carolina finally scored. With South Carolina held to 37 rushing yards the final result was 24–6.|$|E

5|$|On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium {{under the}} {{operational}} plan Fall Gelb (Case Yellow). The Allied armies attempted {{to halt the}} German Army in Belgium, believing {{it to be the}} main German thrust. After the French had fully committed the best of the Allied armies to Belgium between 10 and 12 May, the Germans enacted the second phase of their operation, a break-through, or sickle cut, through the Ardennes, and advanced toward the English Channel. The German Army (Heer) reached the Channel after five days, encircling the Allied armies. The Germans gradually reduced the pocket of Allied forces, forcing <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea. The Belgian Army surrendered on 28 May 1940, ending the battle.|$|E
5|$|On 25 June 1950 the Korean War {{began when}} the North Korean People's Army invaded the Republic of Korea (ROK) with 90,000 well-trained and {{equipped}} troops who easily overran the smaller and more poorly equipped Republic of Korea Army. In response, the United States (U.S.) and United Nations (UN) began an intervention campaign to prevent South Korea from collapsing. The U.S. troops engaged the North Koreans first at the Battle of Osan where they were badly defeated on 5 July by the better-trained North Koreans. From there, the U.S. and UN suffered {{a steady stream of}} defeats that pushed <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pusan Perimeter by August. At the same time, North Korean agents began to infiltrate behind UN lines and attack military targets and cities.|$|E

5|$|South of Waegwan, {{two more}} North Korean {{divisions}} stood ready {{to cross the}} Naktong River in a coordinated attack with the divisions to the north. The experienced NK 3rd Division was concentrated {{in the vicinity of}} Songju, while the untested NK 10th Division was concentrated in the Koryong area. These two divisions crossed in the US 1st Cavalry Division's line. The NK 3rd Division's 7th Regiment started crossing the Naktong on August 9. Despite being spotted and taking fire, the bulk of it reached the east bank safely and moved inland into the hills. The 5th Cavalry Regiment and its supporting artillery, now fully alerted, spotted the other two regiments and forced <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west bank. Only a small number of North Koreans reached the east side where either they were captured, or hid until recrossing the river the following night.|$|E
5|$|There are {{differences}} between the German and French releases of the film. The character Allan Grey is named David Gray for the German release, which Dreyer attributed to a mistake. The German censors ordered cuts to the film that still exist today in some prints. The scenes {{which had to be}} toned down include the doctor's death under the milled flour and the vampire's death from the stake. There are other scenes that were shot and included in the script that do not exist in any current prints of Vampyr. These scenes reveal the vampire in the factory recoiling against a shadow of a Christian cross as well as a ferryman guiding Gray and Gisèle by getting young children to build a fire and sing a hymn to guide <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shore.|$|E
