40|$|Els evangelis donen compte d’una fe molt peculiar: la dels malalts guarits per Jesús. Més d’una vegada els teòlegs han parlat de la “fe dels miracles”. ¿És interessada la fe dels guarits per Jesús com si només pensessin en ser curats? El terme de la fe dels qui Jesús guareix ¿és tan sols aquesta guarició corporal, en benefici propi? O també hi trobem en la fe dels sanats una immersió en el misteri de Jesús que els fa descobrir quina és la persona del Salvador i què poden esperar d’Ell? Aquest treball analitza la fe —senzilla però profundament cristològica: centrada en la persona de Jesús— dels cecs de Jericó, del Centurió que suplica la salut del seu servent, de la dona amb flux de sang i, sobretot, de la dona cananea i del cec de naixença, aquest darrer en l’Evangeli de Joan. L’actitud del cec de naixença és paradigmàtica ja que, en un procés admirable, descobreix el caràcter profètic i messiànic de Jesús, la seva pertinència a Déu, la voluntat del qual realitza, la seva Senyoria i, finalment, la fe en el títol predilecte de Jesús: el de Fill de l’home. El miracle, per tant, no porta a l’egoisme del guarit sinó a l’amor i l’entrega a Crist que ve de Déu i a Déu pertany. Un cop establert el caràcter simple però profundament cristològic de la fe dels guarits, el treball acaba amb una comparació entre la fe segons sant Pau i la fe segons els evangelis. The Gospels {{attest to}} a very {{particular}} kind of faith, that of the sick whom Jesus cured. On more than one occasion, theologians have spoken of the ‘faith of miracles’. Is <b>the</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>Jesus</b> shown by the sick a faith based purely on their hope of healing? Is {{the end result of}} the faith of those healed by Jesus nothing more than physical healing, simply a benefit in its own right? Or does the faith of the healed also involve an immersion in the mystery of Jesus who leads them to the discovery of the person of the Saviour and what they can expect from him? This study analyses the faith – something simple but profoundly christological, because centred on the person of Jesus – of the blind men of Jericho, the centurion with a sick servant, the woman with haemorrhages and, especially, the Canaanite woman and, in the Gospel of John, the man blind from birth. The attitude of the man blind from birth is paradigmatic since he discovers in a wonderful way the prophetic and messianic character of Jesus, his belonging to God whose will he fulfils, his Lordship and, finally, faith in the favourite title adopted by Jesus, the Son of Man. So the miracle performed does not lead to selfishness {{on the part of the}} healed man but to love, and it takes him to Christ who comes from God and belongs to God. Once the simple but profoundly christological nature of the faith of the healed people has been established, the study is brought to a close with a comparison between faith according to St Paul and faith in the Gospels...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we will explore the {{question}} of Jesus' revelation as a central motif of the Johannine Christology {{from the perspectives of}} literary criticism, Jewish apocalypticism and Graeco-Roman dramatic literature. In particular, we will attempt to solve the riddle of the visions developed in John 12. 20 - 36, by answering the fragmentary theory of the text, the claim for the divergent christologies, {{the question of}} realised eschatology with or without future eschatology, and the claim that the Johannine community its symbolic world creates is 'sectarian'. A special attention will be paid to the Son of man as presented in the pericope under discussion {{as well as in the}} Fourth Gospel as a whole. The thesis will be summarised as follows: 1. Over against the fragment theory, the concentric arrangement of Jesus' saying formed predominantly in parallelism shows a deliberate literary design of the author. Set at the end of the earthly ministry of Jesus, John 12. 20 - 36 is a culminating point of the revelatory process of Jesus. 2. The overall conceptual framework to understand John 12. 20 - 36, and thus the Fourth Gospel as a whole, is the apocalyptic idea of the divine mysteries concerning the. end time. The revelation is centred on Jesus the Son of man, identified as the human-like figure of Dan 7, which culminates in his cross as his glorification/lifting-up. The vision of the revealed mysteries in Jesus on the cross embraces the eschatological Messiah, the restoration of Israel and of the Temple, salvation, the vindication of the righteous and the condemnation of the evil, and the Gentiles' pilgrimage, which is comparable to contemporary Jewish apocalyptic writings. 3. The cross of Jesus as the focus of the apocalyptic vision of the end time lies behind the apparently divergent christologies (the Son of man, the Davidic Messiah, divine Wisdom), which are integrated in the text in such a manner that it is impossible for each to be understood in isolation. The combination of these is already found in the Jewish apocalyptic-eschatological hope. The fact that the lifting-up and glorification of the Son of man is given precedence to the Davidic Kingly Messiah deprives a political and military aspect of the popular Jewish expectation. 4. At the same time, the revelatory pattern of the Johannine Jesus is not only explicable in Jewish apocalyptic terms, but it has to be understand in view of the anagnorisis, a popular Graeco-Roman dramatic convention. Within the main plot of the Fourth Gospel Jesus is depicted as the divine homecoming hero-king, as in Homer's Odyssey, whose messianic identity is closed to many and disclosed to those who receive him with faith (and hospitality). This pattern is relevant for most of the Johannine Son of man sayings as well. In this plot development John 12. 20 - 36 is situated in a climactic place where the Jewish crowd fails to recognise Jesus who points to the decisive moment of his revelation on the cross. 5. The Johannine Eschatology is Jesus centred, and its realised aspect is strongly emphasised, because the eschatological terminology is overwhelmingly applied to him. Thus Jesus on the cross is the embodiment of the eschaton. At the same time, the post-Easter period, the time of the church, is open toward its future culmination because of the mission perspective. 6. The revelation of Jesus as the core of the divine mysteries concerning the end-time centres on the cross, which is presented as both the judgement and the salvation of the world. The Johannine understanding of the cross is expressed within the framework of the vindication/exaltation of the suffering righteous. It is implied that Jesus' death and resurrection inaugurates the new, eschatological covenant for the new people of God embracing both Jews and Gentiles. 7. John 12. 20 - 36 envisages an apocalyptic vision of the end-time judgement and salvation, in which the new covenant people is created as a new people of God. The basis of the new 'children of the Light' is no longer the Law as in the old covenant but <b>the</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>Jesus</b> the Light (and to love each other as a new law). This faith is not individualistic but geared towards community building, which includes the believers from the Gentiles. The community itself is the result of the cross of Jesus. The purpose of Jesus' death for 'bearing much fruit' and gathering of 'all' (nations) to his own house is to be accomplished in the community through its mission to the world, despite the probable persecutions...|$|E
