5|$|The aging Greer Stadium was {{not meant}} to last longer than 30years, and was the subject of many renovations in the early 2000s to meet minimum Triple-A standards. In 2003, the Sounds {{proposed}} a new stadium to be built with a mix of public and private funds at the corner of 1st Avenue South and Gateway Boulevard (now Korean Veterans Boulevard) in Downtown Nashville on the former site of the city's thermal transfer energy plant, targeting an opening date in April 2006.

It was to be called First Tennessee Field. Opening day at the proposed new venue was repeatedly pushed back, eventually to as late as April 2009.
