40|$|An {{experimental}} study was undertaken concerning {{the propagation of}} a slant crack under compression. By using the equations of the deformed shape of a crack and by introducing a correction model {{in order to prevent}} the crack lips from incompatible displacements, an estimate of the stress distribution along the crack borders was achieved. It was found that an opening-mode K(l) stress intensity factor (SIF) must be introduced at the crack tips in the overall compressive stress field, in order to give the required space for the lip-slip phenomenon, due <b>to</b> <b>shearing,</b> <b>to</b> take place. This local dilatation {{in the vicinity of the}} crack tip, together with the lip-slip phenomenon, due <b>to</b> <b>shearing,</b> <b>to</b> take place. This local dilatation in the vicinity of the crack tip, together with the lip-slip phenomenon, due to which the initial crack tip is displaced into a new position along the deformed crack borders, causes the out-of-plane propagation of the crack, either towards the largest compressive stress in the case of biaxial stress field, or towards the applied compression in a uniaxial compressive field. A series of experiments on PMMA (perspex) rectangular specimens with pre-existed cracks and slits has been executed and the type of the stress field in the front of the propagated branches is examined by using the method of caustics. It was found that the crack propagation under compression is an interactive process of two conjugate branches, which is strongly influenced by the boundary conditions of the pre-existed discontinuity...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{chemistry}} {{is believed to}} be the key parameter affecting the aggregation and breakage of colloidal suspensions when subjected <b>to</b> <b>shear.</b> <b>To</b> date, only a few works dealt with the understanding of the role of the physical and chemical properties of the particles’ surface upon aggregation under shear. Previous studies suggested that surface modifications strongly affect polymer particles’ adhesion, but it was very challenging to demonstrate this effect and monitor these alterations upon prolonged exposure <b>to</b> <b>shear</b> forces. More importantly, the mechanisms leading to these changes remain elusive. In this work, shear-induced aggregation experiments of polymer colloidal particles have been devised with the specific objective of highlighting material transfer and clarifying the role of the softness of the particle’s surface. To achieve this goal, polymer particles with a core–shell structure comprising fluorescent groups have been prepared so that the surface’s softness could be tuned by the addition of monomer acting as a plasticizer and the percentage of fluorescent particles could be recorded over time via confocal microscopy to detect eventual material transfer among different particles. For the first time, material exchange occurring on the soft surface of core–shell polymer microparticles upon aggregation under shear was observed and proved. More aptly, starting from a 50 % labeled/nonlabeled mixture, an increase in the percentage of particles showing a fluorescent signature was recorded over time, reaching a fraction of 70 % after 5 h...|$|R

These increases in gene expression are dependent on shear-induced actin stress fiber formation. Here, we demonstrate that MC 3 T 3 -E 1 osteoblast-like cells respond <b>to</b> <b>shear</b> with a rapid increase in intracellular Ca(2 +) concentration ([Ca(2 +) ](i)) that we postulate is important to subsequent cellular responses <b>to</b> <b>shear.</b> <b>To</b> test this hypothesis, MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells were grown on glass slides coated with fibronectin and subjected to laminar fluid flow (12 dyn/cm(2)). Before application of shear, cells were treated with two Ca(2 +) channel inhibitors or various blockers of intracellular Ca(2 +) release for 0. 5 - 1 h. Although gadolinium, a mechanosensitive channel blocker, significantly reduced the [Ca(2 +) ](i) response, neither gadolinium nor nifedipine, an L-type channel Ca(2 +) channel blocker, were able to block shear-induced stress fiber formation and increase in c-fos and COX- 2 in MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells. However, 1, 2 -bis(2 -aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-AM, an intracellular Ca(2 +) chelator, or thapsigargin, which empties intracellular Ca(2 +) stores, completely inhibited stress fiber formation and c-fos/COX- 2 production in sheared osteoblasts. Neomycin or U- 73122 inhibition of phospholipase C, which mediates D-myo-inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP(3)) -induced intracellular Ca(2 +) release, also completely suppressed actin reorganization and c-fos/COX- 2 production. Pretreatment of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells with U- 73343, the inactive isoform of U- 73122, did not inhibit these shear-induced responses.
