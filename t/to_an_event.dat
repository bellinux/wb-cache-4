5|$|Despite his socialist and pro-Soviet beliefs, Crawford {{believed}} in collaborating with all foreign archaeologists, regardless of political or ideological differences. In early 1938, he lectured on aerial archaeology at the German Air Ministry; the Ministry published his lecture as Luftbild und Vorgeschichte, and Crawford was frustrated that the British {{government did not}} publish his work with the same enthusiasm. From there, he visited Vienna to meet with his friend, the archaeologist Oswald Menghin; Menghin took Crawford <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>event</b> celebrating the Anschluss, at which he met the prominent Nazi Josef Bürckel.

5|$|The Puget Sound Convergence Zone is an {{important}} feature of Seattle's weather. In the convergence zone, air arriving from the north meets air flowing in from the south. Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle's west, then reunited to the east. When the air currents meet, they are forced upward, resulting in convection. Thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur {{north and south of}} town, but Seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers. The Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm in December 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up <b>to</b> , <b>an</b> <b>event</b> that was not caused by the Puget Sound Convergence Zone and was widespread across the Pacific Northwest.|$|E

25|$|In practice, this {{relationship}} of streamed events is processed through a causal vector engine, which performs a lookup based on recently viewed events and assigns a causal vector <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>event</b> if {{a relationship is}} discovered. If A causes B, the causal vector engine checks if B’s causal vector rule index contains a reference to A. The engine may handle events for different transactions simultaneously, perhaps in a different order than they occurred.|$|E

25|$|If {{event or}} event chain occurs {{during the course}} of a project, it may require some {{mitigation}} effort. In some cases, mitigation plans can be generated. Mitigation plans are an activity or group of activities (small schedule) that augment the project schedule if a certain event occurs. The solution is to assign the mitigation plan <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>event</b> or event chain. These small schedules will be triggered when an event chain occurs. The same mitigation plan can be used for different events.|$|E
