50|$|The biggest re-design in Corgi's {{packaging}} came in 1966 {{with the}} introduction of the 'window box', so called because the model was clearly visible through a plastic window incorporated into the box, initially only on a few Majors and Gift Sets while the main range still retained the cardboard box. The blue and yellow colour scheme was left unchanged. Because of its positive experience with the smaller Husky models sold in blisterpacks - the fully visible Husky models comparing favourably to boxed Matchbox toys at the point of sale, Mettoy also tried the blisterpack for some of its larger Corgi cars between 1966 and 1968. This exercise was limited to a few models; the Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost and 'World of Wooster' Bentley from the Corgi Classics range, Jaguar E-Type 2+2, Lincoln Continental limousine and the 'New' James Bond Aston Martin DB5. However, during 1968 the expensive blisterpacks were abandoned and the window box introduced throughout the whole range. In 1970 boxes for Whizzwheels cars changed to red and yellow. Some of the 'Red Spot' Whizzwheels, which had been rushed into production, were sold in blue and yellow boxes originally printed for cars to be released with the 'Golden Jacks' feature, but with large stickers promoting the new Whizzwheels feature strategically placed over the <b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Wheels</b> printing.|$|R

5000|$|Ford Motor Company {{relied on}} a network of sales agencies-dealers which agreed to sell Model T cars, stock parts, and provide mechanics' services. Ford {{initially}} manufactured fully assembled cars in Detroit and then [...] "knocked them down" [...] (<b>took</b> <b>off</b> the <b>wheels</b> and otherwise prepared them for shipment) and shipped them to dealers. The agents in distant cities reassembled the knocked-down cars before sale. To better serve the network of sales dealerships. Ford took direct control of agencies in New York and Philadelphia in 1905 and the following year established company-owned branches in Boston, Buffalo, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City, initially in leased buildings. Ford branches also sold Ford cars in addition to assembling vehicles for delivery to dealerships. Ford sold over 200,000 autos in 1914, with 80 percent of sales originating from the company's twenty-nine branches. As Ford sales continued to increase, the company built additional branch assembly plants in company-owned buildings, {{most of which were}} designed by Architect Albert Kahn.|$|R
5000|$|Training wheels {{that prevent}} the bike from leaning also prevent countersteering, so that, {{as with a}} tricycle, {{children}} learn to turn the handlebars the wrong way, which must be unlearned later.

[...] Alternatives to using training wheels include removing the pedals from a child's bike, or balance bicycles.|$|R
50|$|Bearingless speed sensors may {{be found}} in almost every {{wheelset}} of a rail vehicle. They are principally used for wheel slide protection and usually supplied by the manufacturer of the wheel slide protection system. These sensors require a sufficiently small air gap and need to be particularly reliable.One special feature of rotary speed sensors that are used for wheel slide protection is their integrated monitoring functions. Two-wire sensors with a current output of 7 mA/14 mA are used to detect broken cables. Other designs provide for an output voltage of around 7 V as soon as the signal frequency drops below 1 Hz. Another method used is to detect a 50 MHz output signal from the sensor when the power supply is periodically modulated at 50 MHz. It is also common for two-channel sensors to have electrically isolated channels. Occasionally it is necessary to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> the <b>wheel</b> slide protection signal at the traction motor, and the output frequency is then often too high for the wheel slide protection electronics. For this application a speed sensor with an integrated frequency divider or encoder can be utilized.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} is a ply shell, ovoid {{in cross}} section and built around a series of frames and stringers. The tandem seats are enclosed ahead of the wing leading edge under a starboard hinged, continuous canopy. The Bonaventura has no <b>wheeled</b> undercarriage, but <b>took</b> <b>off</b> from a <b>wheeled,</b> drop-off dolly and landed on a simple, rubber sprung skid extending from nose to mid chord, aided by a sprung tail skid. The fuselage becomes slim towards the tail, where the double straight tapered horizontal tail is mounted on top of it, far enough forward that its trailing edge is at the rudder hinge. The elevators are fabric covered and the starboard one carries a trim tab. Fin and rudder are also straight tapered and the tall, fabric covered, unbalanced rudder reaches down to the keel.|$|R
6000|$|Tarring Wheels.--Tar is {{absolutely}} essential in a hot country, to mix with the grease that {{is used for the}} wagon-wheels. Grease, alone, melts and runs away like water: the object of the tar is to give consistency to the grease; a very small proportion of tar suffices, but without any at all, a wagon is soon brought to a standstill. It is, therefore, most essential to explorers to have a sufficient quantity in reserve. Tar is also of very great use in hot dry countries for daubing over the wheels, and the woodwork generally, of wagons. During extreme heat, when the wood is ready to crack, all the paint should be scraped off it, and the tar applied plentifully. It will soak in deeply, and preserve the wood in excellent condition, both during the drought and the ensuing wet season. (See [...] "Tar, to make.") It is not necessary to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> the <b>wheels</b> in order to grease the axles. It is sufficient to bore an auger-hole right through the substance of the nave, between the feet of two of the spokes, and to keep a plug in the hole. Then, when you want to tar a wheel, turn it till the hole is uppermost, take the plug out, and pour in the tar.|$|R
5000|$|In June 1911, in {{co-operation}} with Edouard Perrot (Edouard Perrot & Cie), Taddéoli {{started to}} design the seaplane [...] "La Mouette", making preparatory experiments using a Dufaux 4 biplane equipped with floats. On 24/25 June 1911, during a flight meeting in Annecy, he crashed his Dufaux 5 on Lake Geneva. On 26 March 1912 a first takeoff attempt was not successful, and [...] "La Mouette" [...] was destroyed. While taking off to fly from Bern to Biel/Bienne on 3 June 1913, Taddéoli lost a wheel, but the good fortune was again with him. Oskar Bider witnessed the incident and <b>took</b> <b>off</b> with the <b>wheel</b> to catch Taddéoli up, to warn him of the danger: Taddéoli landed without problems in Bienne. During the following years, Taddéoli took part in 45 flight meetings within 53 months, and achieved more rewards and records. An application to join the military aviation troops was rejected because he was married.|$|R
60|$|To their {{disappointment}} {{there was}} within this mountain no regular flight of steps {{by means of}} which they could mount to the earth's surface. A sort of inclined tunnel led upward for a way, and they found the floor of it both rough and steep. Then a sudden turn brought them to a narrow gallery where the buggy could not pass. This delayed and bothered them for a while, {{because they did not}} wish to leave the buggy behind them. It carried their baggage and was useful to ride in wherever there were good roads, and since it had accompanied them so far in their travels they felt it their duty to preserve it. So Zeb and the Wizard set to work and <b>took</b> <b>off</b> the <b>wheels</b> and the top, and then they put the buggy edgewise, so it would take up the smallest space. In this position they managed, with the aid of the patient cab-horse, to drag the vehicle through the narrow part of the passage. It was not a great distance, fortunately, and when the path grew broader they put the buggy together again and proceeded more comfortably. But the road {{was nothing more than a}} series of rifts or cracks in the mountain, and it went zig-zag in every direction, slanting first up and then down until they were puzzled as to whether they were any nearer to the top of the earth than when they had started, hours before.|$|R
60|$|A proper {{diligence}} {{is formed}} of a chariot-body, and two coach-bodies placed one before the other, {{the first in}} front. These are all on a large scale, and the wheels and train are in proportion. On the roof (the three bodies are closely united) is a cabriolet, or covered seat, and baggage is frequently piled there, many feet in height. A large leathern apron covers the latter. An ordinary load of hay, though wider, is scarcely of more bulk than one of these vehicles, which sometimes carries twenty-five or thirty passengers, {{and two or three}} tons of luggage. The usual team is composed of five horses, two of which go on the pole, and three on the lead, the latter turning their heads outwards, as W---- remarked, so as to resemble a spread eagle. Notwithstanding the weight, these carriages usually go down a hill faster than when travelling on the plain. A bar of wood is brought, by means of a winch that is controlled by a person called the conducteur, one who has charge of both ship and cargo, to bear on the hind wheels, with a greater or less force, according to circumstances, so that all the pressure is <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> the <b>wheel</b> horses. A similar invention has latterly been applied to railroad cars. I have since gone over this very road with ten horses, two on the wheel, and eight in two lines on the lead. On that occasion, we came down this very hill, at the rate of nine miles the hour.|$|R
5000|$|Howie has {{a fascination}} with tools and {{building}} things. Mr. Kemp regularly brings scrap wood home for Howie to build projects with. One time, Howie <b>took</b> a <b>wheel</b> <b>off</b> Ramona's tricycle {{to turn it into}} a bicycle, which pleased Ramona. In Ramona and Her Mother, Howie and Ramona made a boat out of scrap wood and tried to make it float in a tub of water. Ramona tried to make it blue by using some bluing liquid. While reaching for it, she spilled it all over both of them, much to Howie and his grandmother's dismay. He also made tin can stilts for both of them when Ramona told him that Mrs. Swink did that as a child.

5000|$|Manufacturers {{of balance}} {{bicycles}} say {{that children can}} learn to bicycle faster because they learn to balance and countersteer first and then to pedal later, and that training wheels slow learning because kids become too dependent on them, acquiring bad habits.

Training wheels that prevent the bike from leaning also prevent countersteering, so that, as with a tricycle, kids learn to turn the handlebars the wrong way, which must be unlearned later.

Balance bikes with no brakes at all except the rider's feet might stop poorly as well, though very young children might not use brakes effectively anyway. Brown recommended simply removing the pedals from a normal kid's bicycle, avoiding the extra expense of a balance bike, and parents have had success with this approach.|$|R
