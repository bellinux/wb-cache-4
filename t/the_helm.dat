5|$|In {{the same}} period, {{different}} helms {{began to be}} used for different ranks: sovereigns' and knights' helms faced forwards (affronté), whereas those of peers and gentlemen faced to the right (dexter). In the medieval period crests would always have faced the same way as <b>the</b> <b>helm,</b> but {{as a result of these}} rules, the directions of the crest and <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> might be at variance: a knight whose crest was a lion statant, would have the lion depicted as looking over the side of <b>the</b> <b>helm,</b> rather than towards the viewer. Torses also suffered artistically, being treated not as silken circlets, but as horizontal bars.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>helm</b> {{on which}} the crest was borne was {{originally}} a simple steel design, sometimes with gold embellishments.

The decorative mantling (a stylised cloth cloak that hangs from <b>the</b> <b>helm)</b> was originally of red cloth lined with ermine, but was altered to cloth of gold lined ermine by Elizabeth.|$|E

5|$|If Wilde's {{period at}} <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> of the {{magazine}} was a mixed success from an organizational point of view, one can also argue that it {{played a pivotal role}} in his development as a writer and facilitated his ascent to fame.

5|$|A short interregnum followed, {{during which}} {{ownership}} {{was transferred to}} J.W. Skaggs. Skaggs continued to push Alexander's Democratic Party/states' rights agenda during his short five weeks at <b>the</b> <b>helm.</b> The poor economics of the weekly paper were unchanged, however, and Skaggs immediately moved to unload his newly acquired white elephant. He cut his losses and avoided the stigma of financial failure for himself and the conservative political movement by giving away the paper outright to two men who worked for him as printers, William Thompson and William Victor. According to Thompson's later recollection, Skaggs sweetened the transfer of ownership by tossing in two bundles of paper and two cords of firewood for the new owners.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Hipper hove to {{in order}} to rescue her man {{overboard}} and Glowworms survivors. The German sailor was not found, but 40 British sailors were recovered, although at least six later died of their wounds. Lieutenant Ramsay, the senior surviving officer, told his rescuers that neither <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> nor the emergency rudder were manned when the ships collided so the destroyer's turn towards Hipper was probably accidental. German accounts only mention four torpedoes fired by Glowworm, but British accounts say all ten were fired. This was confirmed by photographic evidence taken after the collision showing all of her torpedo tubes empty.|$|E
