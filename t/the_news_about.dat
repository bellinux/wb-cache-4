5|$|In 1933, H.D. {{traveled}} to Vienna to undergo analysis with Sigmund Freud. She {{had an interest}} in Freud's theories as far back as 1909, when she read some of his works in the original German. H.D. was referred by Bryher's psychoanalyst due to her apparent paranoia about the rise of Adolf Hitler which indicated another world war, an idea that H.D. found intolerable. The Great War (World War I) had left her feeling shattered. She had lost her brother in action, while her husband suffered effects of combat experiences, and she believed that the onslaught of the war indirectly caused the death of her child with Aldington: she believed it was her shock at hearing <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>about</b> the RMS Lusitania that directly caused her child to be stillborn. Writing on the Wall, her memoir about this psychoanalysis, was written concurrently with Trilogy and published in 1944; in 1956 it was republished with Advent, a journal of the analysis, under the title Tribute to Freud.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>news</b> <b>about</b> {{the siege}} of Tiberias caused a new {{conflict}} among the crusaders, because Raymond and Ridefort proposed adverse strategies. Emphasizing that the town could resist even a prolonged siege, Raymond wanted to avoid a pinched battle. He also proposed that Guy should send envoys to Antioch and ask Bohemond III to send reinforcements. Hearing Raymond’s proposal, Ridefort and Châtillon accused him of cowardice, adding that passivity would cost the king his kingdom. Since the king was obviously willing to accept Raymond's proposal, Ridefort reminded him Raymond's previous alliance with Saladin. Finally, the king decided to attack and ordered his army to march towards Tiberias.|$|E

25|$|Soon after Seleucus' return, the {{supporters}} of Antigonus tried to get Babylon back. Nicanor was the new satrap of Media and the strategos of the eastern provinces. His army had about 17,000 soldiers. Evagoras, the satrap of Aria, was allied with him. It was obvious that Seleucus' small force could not defeat the two in battle. Seleucus hid his armies in the marshes that surrounded the area where Nicanor was planning to cross the Tigris and made a surprise attack during the night. Evagoras fell {{in the beginning of}} the battle and Nicanor was cut off from his forces. <b>The</b> <b>news</b> <b>about</b> the death of Evagoras spread among the soldiers, who started to surrender en masse.

However, when they reached Mecca, they found that <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>about</b> the Quraysh's acceptance of Islam was false. Some of the Muslims who had come from Abyssinia returned, but Uthman and Ruqayya stayed.

This doomed the remaining Nationalist forces in the city, and Zheng Tongguo was forced to surrender two days later. Chiang ordered an army of 500,000 men to travel north and take Jinzhou, but Lin directed nearly all of his forces to stop them, and they began to encircle it on October 21. After a week of fighting, the Nationalist army was destroyed on October 28. Remaining KMT garrisons in the Northeast attempted {{to break out of the}} region and flee south, but most were unsuccessful. After Changchun, the only major KMT garrison in the Northeast was Shenyang, where 140,000 KMT soldiers were eventually forced to surrender. By the end of 1948 all of Northeast China was under Communist control.|$|E

He also expelled the Muslim garrison which had been stationing in Tiberias since he made an alliance with Saladin. According to Ali ibn al-Athir, Raymond agreed {{to come to terms with}} the king only after his vassals threatened him with disobedience, and the prelates also announced that they were ready to excommunicate him and to declare his marriage void. Raymond and the king met near Jerusalem, at Fort St Job, which was held by the Hospitallers. After they both dismounted, Raymond did homage to the king on his knees. Guy soon lifted him up and expressed regret for his irregular coronation, according to Ernoul.|$|E
25|$|Whale hunting {{equipment}} is legally restricted to hooks (blásturkrókur), ropes, mønustingari (a specially-designed Faroese knife {{to cut the}} whale's spine, so it dies within seconds) and assessing-poles for measurement. When the men hear <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>about</b> the grindaboð (that a whale pod has been discovered near land), fishermen already at sea in their boats sail towards the whales and wait for other boats to arrive. In older times the boats which were used to the whale hunt were the traditional wooden rowing boats. In modern times they use boats with engines; these boats can be wooden boats or other types of boats like fiberglass boats. In the village of Vágur however they have preserved ten old whaling boats, which are wooden rowing boats, the oldest one dates back to 1873. These boats are still in use but mostly for pleasure trips. Most of the boats used in whale hunts are small modern fishing boats. In Vágur equipment like ropes and hooks (for the whales blowhole) are kept in boat houses and only taken out from their place when there is grindaboð in the island of Suðuroy.|$|E
