For I have been {{attacked}} by a painful inability to urinate, and also dysentery, so violent that nothing can be added to the violence of my sufferings. But the cheerfulness of my mind, which comes from the recollection of all my philosophical contemplation, counterbalances all these afflictions. And I beg you {{to take care of the}} children of Metrodorus, in a manner worthy of the devotion shown by the young man to me, and to philosophy.|$|E
500|$|Digital rights advocates, {{including}} the Free Software Foundation, Electronic Frontier Foundation, and computer engineer and activist Brewster Kahle, {{have criticized the}} iPad for its digital rights restrictions. In April 2010, Paul Sweeting, an analyst with GigaOM, was quoted by National Public Radio as saying, [...] "With the iPad, you have the anti-Internet in your hands. ... It offers [...] the opportunity to essentially re-create the old business model, wherein they are pushing content <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> their terms rather than you going out and finding content, or a search engine discovering content for you." [...] But Sweeting also thought that the limitations imposed by Apple impart {{the feeling of a}} safe neighborhood, saying, [...] "Apple is offering you a gated community where there's a guard at the gate, and there's probably maid service, too." [...] Laura Sydell, the article's author, concludes, [...] "As more consumers have fears about security on the Internet, viruses and malware, they may be happy to opt for Apple's gated community." [...] The Russian government has switched from iPads to Android devices over security concerns.|$|E

Verily, I discoursed <b>to</b> <b>thee</b> <b>on</b> Religion in its true form and on all the eternal regions. It is exceedingly disagreeable to me to learn that thou didst not, from folly, receive what I imparted. The recollection of all that I told <b>thee</b> <b>on</b> that occasion will not come to me now. Without doubt, O son of Pandu, thou art destitute of faith and thy understanding is not good. It is impossible for me, O Dhananjaya (Arjuna), to repeat, in detail, all that I said on that occasion. That religion about which I discoursed <b>to</b> <b>thee</b> then is more than sufficient for understanding Brahma. I cannot discourse on it again in detail. I discoursed <b>to</b> <b>thee</b> <b>on</b> Supreme Brahma, having concentrated myself in Yoga.|$|R
500|$|The opening {{movement}} is a chorale fantasia, [...] "" [...] (Out of deep anguish I call <b>to</b> <b>You),</b> <b>on</b> the hymn tune in Phrygian mode. It combines {{the structure of}} a motet with chromatic and dissonant harmonies. As in his motets and the chorale cantata Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein, BWV 2, Bach uses the old style of scoring, with all instruments doubling the vocal parts. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that Bach's use of older musical style may reflect Bach pointing back at the source, Luther's paraphrase of a text from the Old Testament. The lower voices begin each line with imitation on the melody to come, which is then presented in long notes by the soprano as a cantus firmus. The musicologist Julian Mincham interprets the imitative counterpoint as a [...] "portrayal of the individual cries of distress which coalesce to form a combined human clamour". John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, compares the style to both Heinrich Schütz and Anton Bruckner, observing that although using the means of older masters, Bach [...] "push the frontiers of this motet movement almost out of stylistic reach through abrupt chromatic twists to this tune in Phrygian mode." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brooks {{began her}} {{entertainment}} {{career as a}} dancer, joining the Denishawn modern dance company in Los Angeles (whose members included founders Ruth St. Denis, and Ted Shawn, {{as well as a}} young Martha Graham) in 1922. In her second season with the company, Brooks had advanced to a starring role in one work opposite Shawn. A long-simmering personal conflict between Brooks and St. Denis boiled over one day, however, and St. Denis abruptly fired Brooks from the troupe in 1924, telling her {{in front of the other}} members that [...] "I am dismissing you from the company because you want life handed <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> a silver salver". The words left a strong impression on Brooks; when she drew up an outline for a planned autobiographical novel in 1949, [...] "The Silver Salver" [...] was the title she gave to the tenth and final chapter.|$|E
2500|$|This {{implies that}} a [...] "traditional combination" [...] of bread, beer, cheese, and pickle was popular before {{rationing}} in the United Kingdom (during and after World War II). In 1956, author Adrian Bell reported: [...] "There's a pub {{quite close to}} where I live where ... all you need say is, 'Ploughboy's Lunch, Harry, please'. And {{in a matter of}} minutes a tray is handed across the counter <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> which is a good square hunk of bread, a lump of butter and a wedge of cheese, and pickled onions, along with your pint of beer". Only one year later, in June 1957, another edition of the Monthly Bulletin of the Brewers' Society, referred to a ploughman's lunch using exactly that name, and said that it consisted of [...] "cottage bread, cheese, lettuce, hard-boiled eggs, cold sausages and, of course, beer". The Glasgow newspaper The Bulletin from 15 April 1958 and The Times from 29 April 1958 refer to a ploughman's lunch consisting of bread, cheese and pickle.|$|E

2500|$|In the United Kingdom and {{the other}} Commonwealth realms, the British (and Commonwealth) monarch sends {{greetings}} (formerly as a telegram) on the 100th birthday and on every birthday beginning with the 105th. The tradition of Royal congratulations dates from 1908, when the Secretary for King Edward VII sent a congratulatory letter to Reverend Thomas Lord of Horncastle in a newspaper clipping, declaring, [...] "I am commanded by the King to congratulate you on the attainment of your hundredth year, after a most useful life." [...] The practice was formalised from 1917, under the reign of King George V, who also sent congratulations on the attainment of a 60th Wedding anniversary. Queen Elizabeth II sends a greeting card style with the notation: [...] "I am so pleased {{to know that you}} are celebrating your one-hundredth birthday, I send my congratulations and best wishes <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> such a special occasion", thereafter each few years the card is updated with a current picture of the Queen to ensure people do not receive the same card more than once. The Queen further sends her congratulations on one's 105th birthday and every year thereafter as well as on special wedding anniversaries; people must apply for greetings three weeks before the event, on the official British Monarch's website.|$|E
2500|$|The {{developers}} considered having GLaDOS and Chell act as [...] "buddy cops {{against a}} new threat", but felt that since Chell never talked, {{it would not}} work. He compared her transformation into a potato and having her power stripped away to the game Jenga: [...] "You’re taking stuff off the bottom and seeing what happens." [...] While {{she was in the}} potato form, the designers noticed a [...] "very stark difference between this imperious, all-powerful GLaDOS talking to you, and this powerless GLaDOS talking <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> your gun". They found that play testers were not interested in her when she was powerless and insulting players and would question why they were [...] "carting this person along". They decided to give her a personality shift and become Chell's [...] "sidekick" [...] on the basis that [...] "she can’t just be needling you for a half hour". In order to keep players from feeling that they should want to abandon GLaDOS in her powerless form to prevent her from becoming powerful again, the designers made sure to give players reason to bring her with them. In considering the interaction between Chell and GLaDOS, Erik Johnson compared GLaDOS to [...] "a jealous ex-girlfriend", noting [...] " [...] the only person she can have interaction with, but the problem is her only way of interacting with anyone is to test them". While they introduced new characters into the game, the focus of the story in Portal 2 remained the connection and interaction between Chell and GLaDOS, and focuses more on the fallout from Chell's destruction of GLaDOS from the first game.|$|E
