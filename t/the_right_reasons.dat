2500|$|According to Kierkegaard, {{the human}} self desires {{that which is}} beyond reason. Desire itself {{appears to be a}} desire for the infinite, as Plato once wrote. Even the desire to propagate, {{according}} to Plato, is a kind of desire for immortality—that is, we wish to live on in time through our children and their children. Erotic love itself appears as an example of this desire for something beyond the purely finite. It is a taste of what could be, if only it could continue beyond the boundaries of time and space. As the analogy implies, humans seek something beyond the here and now. The question remains, however, why is it that human pathos or passion is the most precious thing? In some ways, it might have to do with our status as existential beings. It is not thought that gets us through life—it is action; and what motivates and sustains action is passion, the desire to overcome hardships, pain, and suffering. It is also passion that enables us to die for ideals {{in the name of a}} higher reality. While a scientist might see this as plain emotion or simple animal desire, Kierkegaard sees it as that which binds to the source of life itself. The desire to live, and to live in the right way, for <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>reasons,</b> and with the right desires, is a holy and sacred force. For Kierkegaard all Christian action should have its ground in love, which is a passion.|$|E
50|$|Aristotle {{asserted}} that man had three natures: body (physical/metabolism), animal (emotional/appetite) and rational (mental/conceptual). Physical nature can be assuaged through exercise and care, emotional nature through indulgence of instinct and urges, and mental through human reason and developed potential. Rational development {{was considered the}} most important, as essential to philosophical self-awareness and as uniquely human. Moderation was encouraged, with the extremes seen as degraded and immoral. For example, courage is the moderate virtue between the extremes of cowardice and recklessness. Man should not simply live, but live well with conduct governed by moderate virtue. This is regarded as difficult, as virtue denotes doing <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thing, to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> person, at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time, to <b>the</b> proper extent, in the correct fashion, for <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>reason.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1965, South Vietnam {{went from}} being a rice {{exporter}} to an importer. Rice imports continued until the dissolution of the state in 1975. This was caused by declines in crop harvests from 1965 to 1968. The production levels began to rise from 1968 onwards due to the expansion of ricelands and increased productivity. This was caused by the increasing use of chemical fertilizers, mechanization and new high-yield crop varieties. <b>The</b> <b>right</b> <b>reason</b> for rice import until 1975 was that the rice demand in VC-controlled zones increased, a demand accompanied by more and more intrusion of North Vietnamese troops to the South Vietnam.|$|R
