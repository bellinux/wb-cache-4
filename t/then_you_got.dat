Yes, my lads, although I would not wish to see the return of those stirring days, I'm free to assert that the world lost something good, and that it was not all clear gain when the old four-in-hand Royal Mail coaches drove out of the present into the past, and left the Iron Horse in possession of the field.|$|E

Jon Lawler then gives an epilogue: [...] "One thing I do know, flip Vanity's head, and the tail leads to envy. And she gets into your blood stream, she'll turn your grey matter green.

30|$|Data Sovereignty: PAR# 15 stated, “The hacker that we’ve {{put into}} place {{introduced}} some unreliability in our systems. I’m a little concerned about data sovereignty.” This category broadly refers to where the data is stored, and in what geographical location is the data hosted. One of the participants perceived the importance of proximity. PAR# 3 stated, “We need someone local. We wanted someone close that {{we could go out}} to and physically touch…if something went wrong…that was part of the factor going into the cloud.” The relevance of the location determines the authority of a respective data centre to govern the customer data. For instance, the data of an Australian-based customer may be hosted at a US-based cloud service provider. The data, comprising of client records and other detailed information, may be looked at by US-based government officials under the USA Patriot Act. While there is confidentiality of these records, the officials can do this procedure which is within their jurisdiction. By contrast, if the data is hosted within the geographical location of the customer, the data of the cloud subscriber is protected. In terms of the perceived importance of data sovereignty, the respective authority of a cloud provider over their data is essential. PAR# 19 stated that, “Other things that are important to us and guiding our ability include data sovereignty, and the ability {{to get out of a}} cloud provider as well as get in. Obviously in the online music business, we have a fairly large music repository. If you are above the common application of several gigabytes or even hundred gigabytes…several hundred terabytes and upwards, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to have a clear picture of how you get in or out that sort of data footprint.” Another participant claimed that, “Some customers whose data is hosted in the US…the Patriot Act doesn’t bother them. It is important where it is hosted…how they manage their data centre…You have to do your own due diligence. Make sure to cover your bases.” PAR# 2. This participant underscored that reasonable processes should be employed in order for the customer to still have the authority over their data, and not be at the mercy of the cloud provider.|$|E
