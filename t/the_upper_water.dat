25|$|The {{torpedo scad}} is a pelagic {{schooling}} species which {{is found in}} both far offshore oceanic environments {{as well as more}} protected inshore environments. The fish commonly are found in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> column near the surface waters. It is not found in estuaries and appears to be intolerant of dirty or turbid waters. The range of the species extends to more southern waters in summer as the warm waters push further down the coasts.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 1960s, water inflow to the Dead Sea {{from the}} Jordan River was reduced {{as a result}} of {{large-scale}} irrigation and generally low rainfall. By 1975, <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> layer was saltier than the lower layer. Nevertheless, the upper layer remained suspended above the lower layer because its waters were warmer and thus less dense. When the upper layer cooled so its density was greater than the lower layer, the waters mixed (1978–79). For the first time in centuries, the lake was a homogeneous body of water. Since then, stratification has begun to redevelop.|$|E
25|$|Plastic debris {{tends to}} {{accumulate}} at {{the centre of}} ocean gyres. In particular, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch has {{a very high level}} of plastic particulate suspended in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> column. In samples taken in 1999, the mass of plastic exceeded that of zooplankton (the dominant animal life in the area) by a factor of six. Midway Atoll, in common with all the Hawaiian Islands, receives substantial amounts of debris from the garbage patch. Ninety percent plastic, this debris accumulates on the beaches of Midway where it becomes a hazard to the bird population of the island. Midway Atoll is home to two-thirds (1.5 million) of the global population of Laysan albatross. Nearly all of these albatross have plastic in their digestive system and one-third of their chicks die.|$|E

Some geographers and ecologists prefer to regard the western area of the Gobi region (as defined above): the basin of the Tarim in Xinjiang and the desert basin of Lop Nor and Hami (Kumul), as forming a separate and independent desert, called the Taklamakan Desert.|$|R

25|$|The Woolnough {{design was}} used by Sentinel for their larger railway locomotives. It resembled most other three-drum designs, having almost-straight tubes. Its {{distinguishing}} feature was a firebrick wall {{two-thirds of the way}} down the furnace. The furnace grate was on the longer side of this, with the combustion gases passing out through the tube bank, along inside a steel outer casing, then back within the shorter tube bank. Coiled tube superheaters were placed in the gas flow outside the tubes. The combustion gases thus passed through the tube bank twice, once outwards and then again inwards. A single central chimney exhausted from the centre of the far end, not as usual from outside the tubes. The relative temperature difference between gas passage through the two sections of the bank led to a circulation current that was upwards through the first, hotter, part of the bank and downwards through the further, less hot, bank. Circulation was also controlled by an internal weir plate within <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> drum, so as to keep a depth of water above the ends of the hotter tubes, thus avoiding overheating of dry tubes.|$|E
500|$|Based on catch records, the cookiecutter shark {{appears to}} conduct a diel {{vertical}} migration of up to [...] each way. It spends the day {{at a depth of}} , and at night it rises into <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> column, usually remaining below , but on rare occasions venturing to the surface. This species may be more tolerant of low dissolved oxygen levels than sharks in the related genera Euprotomicrus and Squaliolus. It is frequently found near islands, perhaps for reproductive purposes or because they hold congregations of large prey animals. In the northeastern Atlantic, most adults are found between 11°N and 16°N, with the smallest and largest individuals being found in lower and higher latitudes, respectively. There is no evidence of gender segregation.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is unclear}} {{what to make}} of these apomorphies {{supposedly}} uniting Anseriformes and bony-toothed birds, for on the other hand, the sternum, distal humerus, leg and foot bones of pelagornithids seem to show apomorphies typical of [...] "higher waterbirds". While details of the braincase bones are held to be very informative phylogenetically, the skull features in which the two groups are similar are generally related {{to the point where the}} bill attaches to the skull, and thus might have been subject to the selective forces brought about by skimming food from <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> layer. The apparent non-neoavian traits distinguishing pelagornithids could just as well be retained or atavistic plesiomorphies; as the [...] "higher waterbirds" [...] are very ancient Neoaves and none of the suspected basal members of their radiation (see also [...] "Graculavidae") were included in the analysis, it is not known for sure when the derived conditions typical of modern Neoaves were acquired. Footbone traits are notoriously prone to selection forces in birds, with convergent evolution known to inhibit or even invalidate cladistic analyses; however, the apparent autapomorphies of the lower arm and hand bones are hard to explain by anything else than an actual relationship. The location of the salt glands inside the eye sockets of Osteodontornis, Pelagornis (and probably others) shows that whatever their relationships were, the pelagornithids adapted to an oceanic habitat independently from penguins and tubenoses, which instead have supraorbital salt glands. Their missing or vestigial hallux – like in ducks but unlike in pelicans which have all four toes fully developed and webbed – was held against a close relationship with pelicans. But as is known today, pelicans are closer to storks (which have a hallux but no webbing) than to pseudotooth birds and evolved their fully webbed toes independently. With both a webbed and a hypotrophied hallux being apomorphic and paraphyletic, its absence in pseudotooth birds does not provide much information on their relationship.|$|E

50|$|The Great Pacific garbage patch {{has one of}} {{the highest}} levels known of plastic {{particulate}} suspended in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> column. As a result, it is one of several oceanic regions where researchers have studied the effects and impact of plastic photodegradation in the neustonic layer of water. Unlike organic debris, which biodegrades, the photodegraded plastic disintegrates into ever smaller pieces while remaining a polymer. This process continues down to the molecular level.As the plastic flotsam photodegrades into smaller and smaller pieces, it concentrates in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> column. As it disintegrates, the plastic ultimately becomes small enough to be ingested by aquatic organisms that reside near the ocean's surface. In this way, plastic may become concentrated in neuston, thereby entering the food chain.|$|E

50|$|Abralia andamanica is {{a species}} of enoploteuthid {{cephalopod}} native to the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. It is known from Australia, Indonesia, Japan and Hawaii. It is associated with shelf waters, and will rise to <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> column at night to feed. Females spawn eggs 0.9-1.5 mm in diameter in gelatinous strings.|$|E
50|$|Most {{species are}} coastal fish, {{and very few}} venture into waters further {{offshore}} than the continental shelf, and these species are generally moved by ocean currents. They inhabit a range of environments including sand flats, bays, lagoons, reefs, sea mounts and estuaries.

50|$|Little {{is known}} of their habits, but they are {{believed}} to feed on crustaceans. The larvae metamorphose into the adult form at about 7 mm standard length. Larvae and immatures inhabit <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>water</b> layers, down to some dozen metres; larvae before notochord flexion/metamorphosis in particular can sometimes be found right at the surface.
