50|$|QIK was {{designed}} & {{developed by a}} startup within Qantas Airways called Qadrant, as a productivity tool {{for use in the}} airline's reservation call centres. The Q.I.K. acronym was derived from its use of a separate keypad attached to the keyboard. The keys on the keypad acted as function keys.

It is {{an alternative}} text input method to <b>the</b> traditional <b>physical</b> <b>keyboards</b> and default keyboards provided by the device manufacturer.|$|R
25|$|The BlackBerry Priv {{received}} mixed reviews. Critics {{praised the}} Priv's user experience for incorporating BlackBerry's traditional, productivity-oriented features {{on top of}} the standard Android experience, including a notifications feed and custom e-mail client. Some critics felt that <b>the</b> device's <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard</b> did not perform as well as those on previous BlackBerry devices, and that the Priv's performance was not up to par with other devices using the same system-on-chip. The Priv was also criticized for being more expensive than similarly-equipped devices in its class.|$|R
50|$|Hypermodernism {{displays}} a deep bias against objects physical and non-physical. It {{can be described}} as anti-object; however it is NOT anti-materialistic. Objects are viewed as an extraneous mediator between attribute and function. Over time, hypermodernism employs attributes to perform the functions of objects, and only those extant objects that can adequately convey the properties of its attributes are allowed to survive. Those objects that are irreducible to complete attributes will disappear {{as in the case of}} <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard.</b> Over time, the attribute-function relationship becomes synonymous.|$|E

40|$|Computer {{keyboards}} {{are used}} to input hundreds of di#erent languages using many di#erent alphabets. Despite this diversity, <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> layout of <b>keyboards</b> is fairly uniform, with keyboards generally containing approximately 80 keys spread across six rows (excluding cursor keys and numberpad).

50|$|The Linux console is {{a system}} console {{internal}} to the Linux kernel (a system console is the device which receives all kernel messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user mode). The Linux console provides {{a way for the}} kernel and other processes to send text output to the user, and to receive text input from the user. The user typically enters text with a computer keyboard and reads the output text on a computer monitor. The Linux kernel supports virtual consoles - consoles that are logically separate, but which access <b>the</b> same <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard</b> and display. <b>The</b> Linux console (and Linux virtual consoles) are implemented by the VT subsystem of the Linux kernel, and do not rely on any user space software. This is in contrast to a terminal emulator, which is a user space process that emulates a terminal, and is typically used in a graphical display environment.|$|R
50|$|On-screen {{keyboards}} {{can be used}} to {{type and}} enter data without using <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard.</b> An on-screen keyboard may contain all the standard keys including all letters, numbers, symbols, and system keys like Home, End, Insert, Page Up and Page Down, Ctrl, Alt, Caps, and Shift, and can even extend the set of characters available by simulating alternative layouts. These keys can be selected using the mouse or another pointing device, or a single key or small group of keys {{can be used to}} cycle through the keys on the screen. The on-screen keyboard is {{the most common type of}} virtual keyboard. The accuracy of this keyboard depends only on hitting the right key. The main purpose of an on-screen keyboard is to provide an alternative mechanism for disabled users who cannot use a physical keyboard, or to provide text input on devices lacking a physical keyboard, such as smartphones and tablets.|$|E

25|$|Due to the bialphabetic {{nature of}} <b>the</b> language, actual <b>physical</b> <b>keyboards</b> with <b>the</b> Serbian Cyrillic layout {{printed on the}} keys are {{uncommon}} today. Typical keyboards sold in Serbian-speaking markets are marked with Serbian Latin characters and used with both the Latin (QWERTZ) and Cyrillic layout configured in the software. What makes the two layouts this readily interchangeable is that the non-alphabetic keys are identical between them, and alphabetic keys always correspond directly to their counterparts (except the Latin letters Q, W, X, and Y that have no Cyrillic equivalents, and the Cyrillic letters Љ, Њ and Џ whose Latin counterparts are digraphs LJ, NJ and DŽ). This also makes the Serbian Cyrillic layout a rare example of a non-Latin layout based on QWERTZ.|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} layout uses <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> US <b>keyboard</b> to type diacritics in some {{operating systems}} (including Windows). This is the US-International layout, which uses the right [...] key as an [...] key to support many additional characters directly {{as an additional}} shift key. (Since many smaller keyboards don't have a right [...] key, Windows also allows + {{to be used as}} a substitute for [...]) This layout also uses keys , , , [...] and [...] as dead keys to generate characters with diacritics by pressing the appropriate key, then the letter on the keyboard. The international keyboard is a software setting installed from the Windows control panel or similar; the additional functions (shown in blue) may or may not be engraved on the keyboard, but are always functional. It can be used to type most major languages from Western Europe: Afrikaans, Danish, Dutch, English, Faroese, Finnish, French, German, Icelandic, Irish, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Scottish Gaelic, Spanish, and Swedish. Some less common western European languages, such as Maltese and Welsh, are not fully supported by the US-International keyboard layout.|$|R
50|$|Portable {{computers}} {{can be classified}} according to <b>the</b> presence and <b>physical</b> appearance of <b>keyboards.</b> Slates and booklets {{do not have a}} <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard,</b> and usually accept text and other input by use of a virtual keyboard shown on a touchscreen-enabled display. Hybrids, convertibles, and 2-in-1s all have <b>physical</b> <b>keyboards</b> (although these are usually concealable or detachable), yet they typically also make use of virtual keyboards. Some 2-in-1s have processors and operating systems like a full laptop, whilst having the flexibility of being used as a tablet. Most tablets can use separate keyboards connected using Bluetooth.|$|R
40|$|Part 5 : Secure SystemsInternational audienceCommercial anti-malware systems {{currently}} rely on signatures or patterns {{learned from}} samples of known malware, and {{are unable to}} detect zero-day malware, rendering computers unprotected. In this paper we present a novel kernel-level technique of detecting keyloggers. Our approach operates {{through the use of}} a decoy keyboard. It uses a low-level driver to emulate and expose keystrokes modeled after actual users. We developed a statistical model of the typing profiles of real users, which regulates the times of delivery of emulated keystrokes. A kernel filter driver enables the decoy keyboard to shadow <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard,</b> such as one single keyboard appears on the device tree at all times. That keyboard is <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard</b> when the actual user types on it, and the decoy keyboard during time windows of user inactivity. Malware are detected in a second order fashion when data leaked by the decoy keyboard are used to access resources on the compromised machine. We tested our approach against live malware samples that we obtained from public repositories, and report the findings in the paper. The decoy keyboard is able to detect 0 -day malware, and can co-exist with a real keyboard on a computer in production without causing any disruptions to the user’s work...|$|E

40|$|Touchscreen {{devices have}} paved {{their way into}} the mobile scene, {{presenting}} a wide set of possibilities but a comparable number of new challenges, particularly for people who are blind. While these devices have a small number of tactile cues, such as buttons, they provide the opportunity to create novel interaction techniques. In this paper, we present mBrailler. mBrailler is a mobile braille keyboard that combines <b>the</b> benefits of <b>physical</b> <b>keyboards</b> (speed and accuracy) and gestural interfaces (flexibility and personalization). We built an 8 -button Braille keyboard that can be attached to the back of mainstream smartphones allowing fast and familiar chorded input. On the other hand,the touchscreen enables thumb entered gestures for more complex text editing operations, such as caret movement, text selection, copy, and paste. This project combines the tactile benefits of Braille typewriters with the customization of smartphone applications. We aim to provide a more efficient and effective typing experience for blind users, thus increasing their productivity with current mobile devices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The article {{presents}} {{the concept and}} pilot implementation of wireless (Blutetooth-based) integration of the Braille notetaker environment and the environment of touchscreen-based devices (such as smartphones) operating under the Android system. Advanced functions of Android-based devices are hardly accessible to the blind using a touchscreen; one aim of such integration is to enable accessing them with a notetaker. Another is to allow the blind who work with notetakers {{on a daily basis}} and use common touchscreen-based smartphones and tablets to write using <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> Braille <b>keyboard</b> of a notetaker as well as its editing functions; this would solve many problems encountered and prevent numerous errors made by the blind when using the virtual QWERTY keyboard of a touchscreen-based device. Pilot implementation of the concept included developing a communication protocol for a notetaker operated under Windows CE and an Android-based smartphone; services to be provided to notetakers by smartphones have been developed as well. The implemented services dealt with managing contacts and composing messages – operations that normally require considerable interaction with a QWERTY keyboard. Favourable results of initial research on pilot implementation conducted among the blind indicate a need for further development of this concept. I...|$|R
