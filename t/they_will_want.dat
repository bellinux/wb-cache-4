500|$|In {{a review}} for The Historian, Lawrence Frederick Kohl {{wrote of the}} book that [...] "Eric Foner's prodigious {{research}} and his deep knowledge of the era allow him to provide perhaps the best account of this subject available today. Even seasoned scholars will find facts in this volume that are new to them and fresh insights that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>want</b> to consider." [...] Patrick Prendergast stated in The Irish Times that [...] "For the interested but non-specialist reader Foner's book is a triumph, and he explains the progression in Lincoln's views of slavery in an accessible and exciting way." ...|$|E
2500|$|When a photon {{is excited}} in the {{substrate}} of a SC, an electron and hole are separated. [...] Once the electrons and holes are separated, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>want</b> to recombine {{since they are}} of opposite charge. [...] If the electrons can be collected prior to this happening {{they can be used}} as a current for an external circuit. [...] Designing the thickness of a solar cell is always a trade-off between minimizing this recombination (thinner layers) and absorbing more photons (thicker layer).|$|E
2500|$|His {{first article}} criticising {{practical}} Zionism, called [...] "Lo ze haderekh" [...] (This {{is not the}} way) published in 1888 appeared in HaMelitz. In it, he wrote that the Land of Israel will not be capable of absorbing all of the Jewish Diaspora, not even a majority of them. [...] Ahad Ha'am also argued that establishing a [...] "national home" [...] in Zion will not solve the [...] "Jewish problem"; furthermore, the physical conditions in Eretz Yisrael will discourage Aliyah, and thus Hibbat Zion must educate and strengthen Zionist values among the Jewish people enough that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>want</b> to settle the land despite the greatest difficulties. [...] The ideas in this article became the platform for Bnei Moshe Sor (sons of Moses), a group he founded that year. B'nei Moshe Sor, active until 1897, worked to improve Hebrew education, build up a wider audience for Hebrew literature, and assist the Jewish settlements. [...] Perhaps more significant was Derekh Kehayim (1889), Ha'am's attempt to launch a unique movement from a fundamentalist perspective incorporating {{all the elements of}} a national revival, but driven by force of intellect.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't think <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>want</b> water, Master. They {{had as much}} as {{they could}} drink, before starting, and they are {{accustomed}} to drink when their work is over." ...|$|E
