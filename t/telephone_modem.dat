Users in 14 countries participated in the 24-hour boycott. The united European campaign aimed for:*"Costs of all telephone calls to more closely mirror the independently audited cost to telecommunications operators of providing these calls, as already mandated by EU law."*"Introduction of flat-rate charges for—in the first instance—local calls, so that anyone can talk to friends and relatives, and Internet users can dial up to Internet Service Providers using a <b>telephone</b> <b>modem,</b> without worrying about the clock ticking and charges ratcheting up."*"For any remaining metered calls, abolition of the minimum call charge so that calls are paid for solely by the time spent connected."*"For Internet users, quicker introduction of modern access methods such as xDSL, cable modems and satellite access, which do not use the <b>telephone</b> <b>modem</b> and are a great improvement on it for users." ...|$|E

50|$|Always-on connections: Throughout the 1990s, the {{predominant}} mode of consumer Internet access was <b>telephone</b> <b>modem</b> dial-up. The {{rapid increase in}} the number of the dial-up networks increased address consumption rates, although it was common that the modem pools, and as a result, the pool of assigned IP addresses, were shared amongst a large customer base. By 2007, however, broadband Internet access had begun to exceed 50% penetration in many markets. Broadband connections are always active, as the gateway devices (routers, broadband modems) are rarely turned off, so that the address uptake by Internet service providers continued at an accelerating pace.|$|E

50|$|Note {{that the}} goodput (the amount of {{application}} layer useful information) is normally {{lower than the}} maximum throughput used in the above calculations, because of packet retransmissions, higher protocol layer overhead, flow control, congestion avoidance, etc. On the other hand, a data compression scheme, such as the V.44 or V.42bis compression used in <b>telephone</b> <b>modems,</b> may however give higher goodput if the transferred data is not already efficiently compressed.|$|R

50|$|Ways {{to achieve}} higher speeds than 1,200 bits/s, include using <b>telephone</b> <b>modem</b> chips via the {{microphone}} and audio out connectors. This has been proven to work at speeds up to 4,800 bit/s using fax V.27 modems in half-duplex mode. These modems use phase shift keying which works fine {{when there is no}} amplitude shift keying, but at faster speeds such as 9,600 bit/s, signal levels become critical and they are extremely sensitive to group delay in the radio. These systems were pioneered by Simon Taylor (G1NTX) and Jerry Sandys (G8DXZ) in the 1980s. Other systems which involved small modification of the radio were developed by James Miller (G3RUH) and operated at 9,600 bit/s.|$|E
5000|$|Throughput was {{originally}} advertised as equivalent to, and in practice was often somewhat better than, {{that of a}} then-standard 28.8 kbit/s <b>telephone</b> <b>modem.</b> In addition, Ricochet could be treated as an [...] "always-on" [...] connection (in the sense that, once connected to the network, it could stay connected even {{when not in use}} without tying up scarce resources, unlike a dialup connection), much the way broadband is today. It was also marketed for a flat monthly fee (the original Ricochet service was $29.95 a month, less than the cost of dialup plus a second phone line). As a result, a significant number of users in the Ricochet service area adopted it as their primary home Internet connection.|$|E
5000|$|Early on, {{and over}} the course of a long weekend, Stoll rounded up fifty terminals, as well as teleprinters, mostly by [...] "borrowing" [...] them from the desks of {{co-workers}} away for the weekend. These he physically attached to the fifty incoming phone lines. When the hacker dialed in that weekend, Stoll located the phone line, which was coming from the Tymnet routing service. With the help of Tymnet, he eventually tracked the intrusion to a call center at MITRE, a defense contractor in McLean, Virginia. Over the next ten months, Stoll spent enormous amounts of time and effort tracing the hacker's origin. He saw that the hacker was using a 1200 baud connection and realized that the intrusion was coming through a <b>telephone</b> <b>modem</b> connection. Stoll's colleagues, Paul Murray and Lloyd Bellknap, assisted with the phone lines.|$|E

50|$|Manufacturers 'build in' {{embedded}} software in the electronics of e.g. cars, <b>telephones,</b> <b>modems,</b> robots, appliances, toys, security systems, pacemakers, televisions and set-top boxes, and digital watches, for example. This software {{can be very}} simple, such as lighting controls running on an 8-bit microcontroller with a few kilobytes of memory with the suitable level of processing complexity determined with a Probably Approximately Correct Computation framework (a methodology based on randomized algorithms), or can become very sophisticated in applications such as airplanes, missiles, and process control systems.|$|R
5000|$|Connecting {{the various}} sites was an {{enormous}} network of <b>telephones,</b> <b>modems</b> and teleprinters. Later additions to the system allowed SAGE's tracking data to be sent directly to CIM-10 Bomarc missiles {{and some of the}} US Air Force's interceptor aircraft in-flight, directly updating their autopilots to maintain an intercept course without operator intervention. Each DC also forwarded data to a Combat Center (CC) for [...] "supervision of the several sectors within the division" [...] ("each combat center had the capability to coordinate defense for the whole nation").|$|R
50|$|Coaxial cables {{are capable}} of {{bi-directional}} carriage of signals {{as well as the}} transmission of large amounts of data. Cable television signals use only a portion of the bandwidth available over coaxial lines. This leaves plenty of space available for other digital services such as cable internet, cable telephony and wireless services, using both unlicensed and licensed spectrum. Broadband internet access is achieved over coaxial cable by using cable modems to convert the network data into a type of digital signal that can be transferred over coaxial cable. One problem with some cable systems is the older amplifiers placed along the cable routes are unidirectional thus in order to allow for uploading of data the customer would need to use an analog <b>telephone</b> <b>modem</b> to provide for the upstream connection. This limited the upstream speed to 31.2k and prevented the always-on convenience broadband internet typically provides. Many large cable systems have upgraded or are upgrading their equipment to allow for bi-directional signals, thus allowing for greater upload speed and always-on convenience, though these upgrades are expensive.|$|E
5000|$|The Keyboard Component {{added an}} 8-bit 6502 {{processor}} making the Intellivision a dual processor computer. It had 16K 10-bit shared RAM that could load and execute both Intellivision CP1610 and 6502 program code from tape; {{a large amount}} as typical cartridges of the day were 4K. The cassettes have two tracks of digital data and two tracks of analog audio completely controlled by the computer. Two tracks are read only for the software, and two tracks for user data. The tape-drive was block addressed with high speed indexing. A high resolution 40x24 monochrome text display could overlay regular Intellivision graphics. There was an input for a microphone and two expansion ports for peripherals and RAM expansion. [...] The Microsoft BASIC programming cartridge used one of these ports. Expanded memory cartridges could support 1000 8KB pages. A third pass-through cartridge port was for regular Intellivision cartridges. It uses the Intellivision's power supply. A 40-column thermal printer was available, and a <b>telephone</b> <b>modem</b> was planned along with voice synthesis and voice recognition.|$|E
5000|$|By late January 1985, {{the pursuit}} {{for the truth}} behind the rumors began with Lewis M. Simons, a Tokyo-based {{correspondent}} for the San Jose Mercury News, who sent a memo to his desk editor, Jonathan Krim. There have been incessant speculations of Philippine [...] "capital flight" [...] that not only involved Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos themselves, but also government officials {{and friends of the}} first family. Simons provided Krim with a list of names, telling him to look into Philippine investments in the San Francisco Bay area. Krim handed over several clips (including Lachicas article) and miscellaneous letters from the Filipino exile community to the investigative reporter Pete Carey attached with a note, [...] "Look into this." [...] Carey began his paper trail after setting up his personal computer and a <b>telephone</b> <b>modem</b> as well as using real-estate data bases to acquire both California and out-of-state records. Another method he used in tracking the story were his interviews with the members of the Filipino exiled opposition who were divided between those who were resolute in helping him and those who deemed themselves apolitical, fearing reprisals if they spoke. In an interview, Carey says, [...] "I kept telling them, Im not interested in quoting people, Im not going to use yours or any names. Im interested in documentary evidence, That convinced people...." [...] Due to budgetary concerns, He continued his trail by exploring records in New York and Chicago through telephone. At a later date, Katherine Ellison from the San Francisco Bureau, who Carey dubs as another [...] "great investigative reporter," [...] joined the group as they conducted interviews and convinced reluctant locals to provide essential information.|$|E
5000|$|Strega (Italian for [...] "witch" [...] or [...] "sorceress") is a hardboiled {{detective novel}} written by American author and {{attorney}} Andrew Vachss, {{first published in}} 1987. The story features the pursuit and destruction by the protagonist Burke, an ex-con private investigator, of a pedophile ring involved in trading child pornography via <b>telephone</b> <b>modems.</b> The novel was written and published long before social concern {{over the use of}} the Internet for spreading or trading child pornography became widespread. It is the second novel in the Burke Series.|$|R
50|$|In 1979, Tom Truscott and Steve Bellovin, {{graduate}} students for Duke University, would create an early predecessor to dial-up Internet access - called the USENET. The USENET was a UNIX based system that used a dial-up connection to transfer data through <b>telephone</b> <b>modems.</b> Dial-up Internet {{has been around}} since the 1980s via public providers such as NSFNET-linked universities and was first offered commercially in July 1992 by Sprint. Despite losing ground to broadband since the late-1990s, dial-up may still be used where other forms are not available or the cost is too high, such as in some rural or remote areas.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{published}} in 1992, and released as a freeware, electronic book in 1994, the book offers {{a unique and}} colorful portrait {{of the nature of}} [...] "cyberspace" [...] in the early 1990s, and the nature of [...] "computer crime" [...] at that time. The events that Sterling discusses occur on the cusp of the mass popularity of the Internet, which arguably achieved critical mass in late 1994. It also encapsulates a moment in the information age revolution when [...] "cyberspace" [...] morphed from the realm of <b>telephone</b> <b>modems</b> and BBS' into the Internet and the World Wide Web.|$|R
