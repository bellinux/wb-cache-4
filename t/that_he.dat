5|$|A {{sequel to}} the game, Ace Attorney Investigations 2, was {{released}} in Japan on February 3, 2011. There are currently no plans for Capcom to release it internationally, but a fan translation has been made and released on the internet. In July 2013, Eshiro said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and Yamazaki {{would like to make}} a third Investigations game, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> intended to secure the needed Capcom personnel and plan everything out in the future, but <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not make any promises.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the book}} by Nationalmuseum, the {{controversy}} concerned Carl Larsson's personal prestige and the ideals <b>that</b> <b>he</b> stood for, but his contemporaries would turn more and more indifferent to these ideals. The events embittered his last years and he declared in his autobiography that the controversy broke him down and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> admitted it with anger. It is clear <b>that</b> <b>he</b> began to identify himself with the work {{and it is possible}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> also identified himself with the sacrificed king, as he primarily saw conspiracies and bad intentions behind the opposition. This identification was made apparent in his self-portrait, in 1916, where he presented himself as king Domalde, and which he donated to Sundborn parish where he lived.|$|E
5|$|After the event, Dumoulin said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{prepared}} at altitude for {{the race}} and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> produced a hard physical effort on the uphill section and went less intensely on the flatter parts.|$|E

6000|$|... "But don't you know, doesn't {{everyone}} here know, <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> a forger and <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> been a convict? He {{ought to be}} hounded out of civilised society." ...|$|R
5|$|Apollo tells Veronica <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{actually}} does want the paternity test. Dick’s father, {{who was involved}} in a corporate crime, appears and berates him for going on the surfing trip in the summer. Apollo takes the paternity test, but the father doesn’t appear. However, Apollo informs Veronica <b>that</b> <b>he</b> actually was a child soldier, enlisting his former roommate to tell her <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wasn’t so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could ensure his father was genuinely loving. The only reason the father did not show up to the paternity test was <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was detained for having the wrong license plates. Apollo and the father meet at the Sheriff’s office, where they have an emotional reunion. Dick angrily confronts his father, but the next time he is seen, he calls off his trip with Logan. Logan tells Parker this news, and she is disappointed.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{opened his}} {{campaign}} with {{a speech at}} Bowling Green on August26, 1899. He answered many allegations {{that had been made}} about him, including claims <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had secretly been seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination all along, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had ambitions of succeeding Senator William Joseph Deboe, and that following the nominating convention, he had agreed to speak on behalf of the Goebel ticket. Brown conceded <b>that</b> <b>he</b> desired Senator Deboe's senate seat and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had agreed to accept the gubernatorial nomination if it had been offered to him, but he denied <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had ever agreed to speak on Goebel's behalf. Outgoing Senator Blackburn also charged that Brown was bolting the party again, just as he had in supporting Stephen Douglas over John C. Breckinridge for president in 1860. Brown replied by quoting an article by William Jennings Bryan's Omaha World-Herald that asserted the right of an individual to vote against the nominee of his party if the individual deemed the nominee unfit.|$|E
5|$|Cotto did {{not attend}} the post-fight press conference, but Freddie Roach in his place stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{believed}} his fighter won, by outscoring Álvarez and blocking many of his shots. Cotto later told reporters in Puerto Rico <b>that</b> <b>he</b> felt he won.|$|E

5|$|During {{the court}} case, Huseby stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted help from society and {{attention}} drawn to his cause. However, he stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> regretted doing this by hijacking. He stated {{that all he}} wanted was {{to send a message to}} the minister of justice and prime minister <b>that</b> <b>he</b> needed help, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not intend that the other passengers be aware of his threats. Huseby stated that the hijacking was spontaneous and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> planned to make an armed robbery or take hostages at the Radisson SAS hotel in Oslo. His defence lawyer argued that Huseby did not commit a hijacking in the letter of the law, but had instead taken hostages, which would result in a lesser sentence. The court psychologists stated that Huseby had a difficult childhood, and had been defined as an alcoholic at the age of 17. They considered him to have very underdeveloped ability to make rational decisions and weak mental health. They also stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> committed crimes to identify himself due to his low self-esteem. On 29 May 1986, Huseby was found guilty of hijacking in Eidsivating Court of Appeal. He was sentenced to three years prison and five years of preventive supervision.|$|E
5|$|During these episodes, Stephen feels {{lonely and}} writes to Isabelle, {{feeling that there}} is no one else to whom he can express his feelings. He writes about his fears <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will die, and confesses <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has only ever loved her.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Dexagoridas, {{one of the}} two {{garrison}} commanders, {{sent word}} to the Roman legate <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was willing to surrender the city. This plan fell through when Gorgopas, the other commander, learned of it and slew Dexagoridas with his own hands. Gorgopas continued to resist fiercely until Flamininus arrived with 4,000 additional troops <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had recently recruited. The Romans renewed their assault and Gorgopas was forced to surrender, though he did secure the condition <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and his garrison could leave unharmed and return to Sparta.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, as to <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> detestably sound. What I mean is <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> a {{man with}} a great {{position}} who's playing all sorts of tricks with it. He doesn't take himself seriously." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps he's wise. Still, {{the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> {{putting up a}} big new orchard-house has some significance. I {{understand}} from Stephen <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> been speculating largely in rubber shares. It's a risky game." ...|$|R

5|$|Feit {{initially}} denied hearing Garza's confession in the rectory, but {{he later}} {{admitted to having}} done so. He accounted for his absence from the sanctuary by explaining <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had broken his glasses that night; he said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> often played with his glasses nervously as he listened to confession. Feit said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had driven back to the pastoral house to get another pair of glasses, and when he arrived he had no key, {{so he had to}} climb into the house on the second floor. He said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> sustained the scratches on his hands as was climbing the outside of the brick structure.|$|E
5|$|Four days later, on 25 January, it was {{announced}} that the Grizzlies was sold to Chicago-based Michael Heisley for US$160million. At a press conference, he stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had the support of Stern, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was committed to keeping the franchise in Vancouver, to making it a winning team, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was an owner that was committed to the market.|$|E
5|$|Freyr arrives {{home and}} neither sleeps nor drinks, {{remaining}} in silence. No one dares speak to him. The god Njörðr sends Freyr's servant Skírnir {{to speak to}} Freyr. Freyr tells Skírnir <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saw a beautiful woman, so beautiful <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was filled with grief and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would soon die {{if he could not}} have her. Freyr tells Skírnir <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must go gain her hand on his behalf—whether the woman's father agrees or not—and he will be rewarded. Skírnir replies <b>that</b> <b>he</b> accepts the mission but only in exchange for Freyr's sword, which can fight on its own. Freyr gives him the sword and Skírnir sets off. Skírnir asks for the woman's hand for Freyr and receives her promise. Nine nights later she is to meet with Freyr at a location called Barey. Skírnir delivers the news to Freyr and Freyr responds with the final stanza from the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál, lamenting <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must wait.|$|E
50|$|Disillusioned by {{the recent}} events, Shaw tells the Secretary-General <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> leaving the United Nations' employ, this time for good, but she refuses {{to allow him to}} do so, saying <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> far too {{valuable}} an asset.|$|R

5|$|He {{also told}} reporters <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was certain that}} Conley was the actual murderer. Slaton privately told friends <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have issued a full pardon, if not for his belief that Frank would {{soon be able to}} prove his own innocence.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{had long}} sought to regain {{contact with his}} old friend Zhang Chongren, {{with whom he had}} lost contact. He {{regularly}} asked any Chinese people <b>that</b> <b>he</b> met if they knew of Zhang, and in 1979 had some success when a staff member in a Brussels Chinese restaurant revealed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was Zhang's godson. Hergé was thus able to re-establish contact with his old friend. The journalist Gérard Valet organised for Zhang to visit Brussels so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and Hergé could be re-united. The event took place in March 1981, and was heavily publicised; Hergé however found the situation difficult, disliking the press attention and finding <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and Zhang had grown distant during the intervening years.|$|E
5|$|Ibn al-Ash'ath {{remained}} {{safe under}} the protection of the Zunbīl, but al-Hajjaj, fearing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might raise another revolt, sent letters to the Zunbīl, mixing threats and promises, to secure his surrender. Finally, in 704 the Zunbīl gave in, in exchange for lifting the annual tribute for 7 or 10 years. Accounts of Ibn al-Ash'ath's end differ: one version holds <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was executed by the Zunbīl himself, or <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died of illness, and that his head was cut off and sent to al-Hajjaj. The more widespread account, however, holds <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was confined to a remote castle at Rukhkhaj in anticipation of his extradition to al-Hajjaj, and chained to his warden, but <b>that</b> <b>he</b> threw himself {{from the top of the}} castle (along with his warden) to his death.|$|E

50|$|Daniel {{goes into}} his office {{followed}} by Erin, who starts making out with him. Amanda promptly interrupts and reminds him <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> supposed to be engaged. Daniel agrees, telling Erin <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> {{in love with someone}} else. When Erin thinks it's Amanda, she suggests a threesome (and possibly a ménage à trois), but Daniel explains <b>that's</b> not what <b>he</b> meant. Erin then leaves.|$|R

5|$|In 1972, Applewhite met Bonnie Nettles, a nurse with an {{interest}} in theosophy and Biblical prophecy. The two quickly became close friends; he later recalled <b>that</b> <b>he</b> felt like he had known her {{for a long time and}} concluded that they had met in a past life. She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by extraterrestrials, persuading him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had a divine assignment. By that time, he had begun to investigate alternatives to traditional Christian doctrine, including astrology. He also had had several visions, including one in which he was told <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was chosen for a role like that of Jesus. In her 2005 profile of Applewhite, Susan Raine speculates <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had a schizophrenic episode around this time.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, on {{an episode}} of Parkinson, McGregor stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had given up alcohol after a period where he was arguably a {{functioning}} alcoholic, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had not had a}} drink in seven years.|$|E
