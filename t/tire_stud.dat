40|$|Tire studs {{are being}} used during winter {{in a number of}} {{countries}} worldwide in order to ensure a more secure and reliable mobility in those countries. For example, more than 60 % of the passenger cars in Sweden use studded tires during wintertime. A <b>tire</b> <b>stud</b> consists of a body made out of aluminum and a pin, which consists of cemented tungsten carbide with cobalt (WC- Co). This is an extremely hard and tough material that improves the driving conditions on slippery winter roads. In this way, human health impacts associated with traffic accidents and fatal crashes are reduced. On the other hand, the use of <b>tire</b> <b>stud</b> pins causes human health impacts since inhalable particles worn from the road can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Other factors, including emissions of toxic substances and occupational health hazards during the production of tire studs, also contribute to negative health impacts. Emissions from ore tailings during mining are known to release considerable amounts of toxic metals and the high energy use during WC-Co production indicate the possibility of notable emissions related to energy production. Furthermore, tungsten is a conflict mineral and thereby contributes, among other factors, to civil warfare in e. g. the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Cobalt is not defined as a conflict mineral but is also mined in that region. The aim {{of this study is to}} answer the question of whether the use of <b>tire</b> <b>stud</b> pins results in net health improvements or not. This was assessed by conducting a cradle to grave life cycle assessment (LCA) focusing on human health impacts related to the use of <b>tire</b> <b>stud</b> pins. All processes from the extraction of tungsten and cobalt, to waste management of tire studs, were considered. The impact category human health was operationalized by the disability adjusted life years (DALY) indicator, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted for relevant parameters, including the varying tungsten content of <b>tire</b> <b>stud</b> pins. An explorative scenario accounting for human health impacts related to tungsten being a conflict mineral was also employed. This was done in order to investigate if the results would be affected applying a wider system boundary. This study can support societal decisions related to tire studs, including both requirements and prohibitions, by evaluating from a life cycle perspective to what extent tire studs succeed with their intended purpose.

40|$|<b>Tire</b> <b>studs,</b> with pins {{typically}} {{made out}} of cemented carbide with cobalt (WC-Co), are used in several countries to improve the gripping power during winter. Throughout their use, the <b>tire</b> <b>studs</b> are worn. This leads to emissions of particles, of which some are nano-sized. Until now, WC-Co nanoparticles have seldom been included in environmental risk assessments of nanomaterials. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the magnitude of emissions of WC-Co (nano) particles from <b>tire</b> <b>studs</b> on a national level, compare WC-Co emissions to those of other nanomaterials, and conduct a screening risk assessment of the WC-Co emissions. The country in focus was Sweden, where 66 % of the passenger cars use <b>studded</b> <b>tires</b> during winter. Substance flow analysis (SFA) was used to quantify the mass flows related to <b>tire</b> <b>studs</b> from the raw material extraction phase to the waste management phase. Furthermore, particle flow analysis (PFA) was used to quantify particle number flows in the use phase, where emissions of W-containing nanoparticles have been observed. As part of these quantifications, use phase emissions of WC-Co nanoparticles were calculated using a leaching-type model based on the number of km driven by the Swedish car fleet and experimental measurements of W-emission rates. Two scenarios – a low-emission and a high-emission scenario – were employed. Preliminary results show annual WC-Co emissions of 10 - 10 ^ 3 kg/year and 10 ^ 15 - 10 ^ 20 particles/year. These estimated emissions were then compared to estimated emissions of some other nanomaterials in Sweden, including silver, titanium dioxide, cerium oxide, fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. This comparison indicated that the emissions of WC-Co nanoparticles from <b>tire</b> <b>studs</b> are in the same range as estimated emissions of some of these other nanomaterials. Our estimation of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) of WC-Co nanoparticles in road runoff was in the same order of magnitude as measured environmental concentrations (MEC) of W-containing particles. The limited existing ecotoxicity data indicate that much higher concentrations are required in order to reach toxic levels, but further studies are needed to confirm this. Overall, the notable emissions of WC-Co nanoparticles during the use of <b>tire</b> <b>studs</b> support the further study and inclusion of this material in risk-related studies of nanoparticles...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 This report {{frames the}} debate over <b>studded</b> <b>tires</b> in terms of {{economic}} principles of marginal cost pricing and efficient resource allocation. In the absence of a user tax, the pavement damage caused by <b>studded</b> <b>tires</b> results in inefficient pricing because social costs associated with the damage are excluded from the price paid by consumers. This leads to over use of <b>studded</b> <b>tires.</b> No attempt was made to quantify the safety effects of <b>studded</b> <b>tire</b> use. A review of research literature was provided to qualitatively support the premise that there is no social benefit from <b>studded</b> <b>tires</b> in Oregon. Quantitative cost analysis was limited to pavement rutting on the state highway system that is sufficient to reduce the useful life of the pavement. The cost estimation was conducted in two stages: first, the wear rates for asphalt and Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement surfaces were estimated, expressed as inches of rut depth per 100, 000 <b>studded</b> <b>tire</b> passes. Linear regression analysis was conducted using rut depth, traffic, and <b>studded</b> <b>tire</b> data from a sample of Oregon highways. A range of wear rates was estimated, reflecting the numerous factors that influence rutting susceptibility of pavements. The mid-points of wear rates for asphalt and PCC were 0. 0386 " and 0. 0093 ", respectively. Second, the wear rate estimates were used to approximate rutting for the state highway system and to predict resurfacing expenses attributable to <b>studded</b> <b>tire</b> traffic. The results indicate that the cost of <b>studded</b> <b>tire</b> damage on Oregon state highways in 1995 was approximately 10 million. This averages to 8 per tire per year. The implications of the cost are then discussed in terms of the allocation effects of underpricing due to an untaxed externality. The external costs pavement damage caused by <b>studded</b> <b>tires</b> result in inefficient pricing because external costs associated with the damage are excluded from the price paid by consumers.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of surveys to determine <b>studded</b> <b>tire</b> usage in Iowa. Also reported are the results of measurements of transverse pavement profiles at selected locations where the pavement is subjected to a high volume of traffic. The surveys were made in January of each of the years 1969 through 1978 and in each of 27 areas into which the state was divided. Estimates of <b>studded</b> <b>tire</b> usage were also made at various locations on Interstate highways in Iowa. The lowest percentage of <b>studded</b> <b>tires</b> was observed in the initial count during the winter of 1968 - 69. Two years later the percentage had increased to the maximum (22. 6 %) and then began a gradual decline. The latest count in January of 1978 indicated 8. 5 % of the cars had <b>studded</b> <b>tires.</b> The decline in the use of <b>studded</b> <b>tires</b> is attributed to the efforts of the Iowa DOT and others to obtain a ban on <b>studded</b> <b>tires</b> and a continual increase in the use of radial tires with claims of improved traction. The wear measurements were recorded by camera. It was found that <b>studded</b> <b>tires</b> have worn ruts in Iowa pavements as deep as 5 / 16 inch.

50|$|The bikes bear {{a passing}} {{resemblance}} {{to those used}} for speedway, but have a longer wheelbase and a more rigid frame. The sport is divided into classes for full-rubber and <b>studded</b> <b>tires.</b> The <b>studded</b> <b>tire</b> category involves competitors riding on bikes with spikes up to 30 mm in length screwed into each tread-less tyre, each bike has 90 spikes on the front tyre and 200-500 on the rear. The use of these spikes in this discipline necessitate the addition of special protective guards (similar to mudguards) over the wheels which extend almost to the ice surface. The spiked tyres produce {{a tremendous amount of}} traction and this means two-speed gearboxes are also required. As with speedway, the bikes do not have brakes.

40|$|This study set out {{to examine}} the effects of <b>studded</b> <b>tires</b> on fatal crashes on roads covered with ice or snow in Sweden and also to {{investigate}} the extra benefits of electronic stability control (ESC) during the winter months. Two different studies are presented in this paper. Both studies used an induced exposure approach. In the main study, 369 in-depth studies of fatal crashes with passenger cars were analyzed to determine whether loss-of-control (LOC) had been a major component or not. Only crashes involving cars without ESC and equipped with approved studded or non-studded winter tires were analyzed. The additional study used police-reported crashes that occurred during the winter seasons 2003 – 2010, involving passenger cars with and without ESC. While police records in Sweden do not include any tire information, it was assumed that most cars involved in crashes during the winter period would be equipped with <b>studded</b> <b>tires.</b> Findings in the main study showed that in 64 % of the fatal crashes on roads covered with ice or snow LOC had been a major component. Furthermore, in 82 % of LOC crashes, the passenger car over-steered prior to collision. <b>Studded</b> <b>tires</b> were found to have a statistically significant effect of 42 % in terms of fatal crash reduction on roads covered with ice or snow, compared to non-studded winter tires. The effect on dry or wet roads in the winter was negative, although statistically non-significant. In the additional study, it was found that ESC further reduced crashes with injuries by 29 %. The benefits on severe and fatal crashes were slightly greater (32 %), although the lower 95 % confidence limit was lower. Although <b>studded</b> <b>tires</b> were shown to reduce the risk of fatal crash involvement, compared to nonstudded winter tires, the proportion of LOC and over-steering among cars with <b>studded</b> <b>tires</b> was large (59 % and 49 %, respectively). It was therefore concluded that <b>studded</b> <b>tires</b> do not prevent all LOC crashes, while ESC has benefits in those crashes since this technology mostly addresses over-steering. This is also supported by the fact that the share of LOC fatal crashes is considerably lower for ESC-equipped cars. This study recommends that non-ESC cars should be fitted with <b>studded</b> <b>tires</b> if they are to be driven on roads covered by ice or snow. If the proportion of <b>studded</b> <b>tires</b> is to be decreased on Swedish roads to reduce the about of hazardous particulates especially in built up areas, from a road safety point of view it is recommended that this should be done in phase with the implementation of ESC on all passenger cars...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{pavement}} wear in the Nordic countries is essentially {{influenced by the}} use of <b>studded</b> <b>tires</b> during long winter seasons. The abrasive effect of the <b>studded</b> <b>tires</b> is the cause of significant damage on the pavement and a contributor to rutting. In addition, the mechanical aggregate removal due to the <b>studded</b> <b>tires</b> is the reason for significant changes in the road surface texture. At traditional dense asphalt pavements, the mechanical wear is initiated by the abrasion of the mortar, which leads to a protrusion of coarse aggregates. Regarding the noise characteristics of asphalt pavements, those texture alterations will have a negative impact. Several methods to reduce the noise emission have been investigated. However, in the Nordic countries, the reduction of maximum aggregate size in the mix design of asphalt pavements is considered {{the most efficient way to}} develop satisfactory pavement noise characteristics. The challenge is to find the right balance between the wear of the mortar and the wear of the coarse aggregates to produce a limited worn surface with positive acoustical characteristics. Within this study, common Norwegian asphalt mixture types, including different rock materials and binder types were investigated to study the effect on {{pavement wear}}, the resulting changes in surface texture and the road's noise properties. Laboratory tests were carried out to simulate the wear by <b>studded</b> <b>tires.</b> The texture characteristics were measured on the test specimens, both initially, during and after testing. In addition, pavement wear, surface texture and tire/road noise was measured on several full-scale test sections. A reduction of the maximum aggregate size causes an increase in mechanical wear by <b>studded</b> <b>tires.</b> However, by reducing the maximum aggregate size, both the initial surface texture and the surface texture of the worn pavement have a positive effect on the acoustical characteristics of the asphalt pavement. The characteristics of the rock material used for the aggregates in the asphalt mixture is crucial for the pavement service life and the development of the surface texture. By using a rock material in the fine fraction that is more resistant against the wear by <b>studded</b> <b>tires</b> than the rock material used for the aggregates in the course fraction, the wear of the pavement surface will be balanced and result in a surface texture that is favorable for little noise generation. To reduce the wear and keep positive acoustical characteristics, a gap graded asphalt mixture type is preferable...|$|R
