5|$|The {{two sides}} commemorated their dead in very {{different}} ways. Various mostly unofficial memorials were set up on <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>side</b> by people seeking to commemorate victims of the border. West Germans such as Michael Gartenschläger and Kurt Lichtenstein were commemorated with signs and memorials, {{some of which were}} supported by the government. The death of East German Heinz-Josef Große in 1982 was commemorated annually by demonstrations on <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>side</b> of the border. After the policy of détente was initiated in the 1970s, this became politically inconvenient and state support for border memorials largely ceased.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} West German state organisations were {{responsible}} for policing <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>side</b> of the border.

5|$|A {{well-developed}} tropical wave exited Africa on August 27. The next day, {{it developed}} into a tropical depression, and shortly thereafter it intensified into Tropical Storm Beryl. On August 29, it passed just south of Cape Verde as it continued intensifying on its west-northwest track. An eye feature appeared in the convection on August 31, suggesting winds of near hurricane status; since the feature was located on <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>side</b> of the deep convection and the storm was slightly asymmetric, the intensity was held just below hurricane status. Shortly after, strong wind shear caused the storm to deteriorate, leaving the low-level circulation exposed on <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>side.</b> Beryl weakened to a tropical depression the next day {{due to the lack}} of convection, and it continued westward without redevelopment. On September 5, a reconnaissance flight into the depression found winds of 65mph (100km/h); this was deemed unrepresentative of the actual intensity as it was recorded in a squall line. The depression became disorganized once more and by September 6, it was no longer identifiable on satellites.|$|E

In 1974 the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food bought the woodland associated with the Leigh Court estate.

5|$|In 1971, M-21 was rerouted in the Flint area.

The former routing of M-21 on <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>side</b> of the county into {{downtown}} was redesignated M-56. When the M-21 designation was replaced with the I-69 designation in 1984, the M-56 designation was retired and M-21 was restored in its place.|$|E
