5|$|Diseases {{which can}} be {{transmitted}} from one organism to another are known as infectious diseases, and the causative biological agent involved {{is known as a}} pathogen. The process by which <b>the</b> <b>pathogen</b> is introduced into the body is known as inoculation, and the organism it affects is known as a biological host. When <b>the</b> <b>pathogen</b> establishes itself in a step known as colonization, it can result in an infection, consequently harming the host directly or through the harmful substances called toxins it can produce. This results in the various symptoms and signs characteristic of an infectious disease like pneumonia or diphtheria.|$|E

5|$|To combat {{pathogens}} that replicate outside cells, antibodies bind to pathogens to link them together, {{causing them}} to agglutinate. Since an antibody has at least two paratopes, it can bind more than one antigen by binding identical epitopes carried on the surfaces of these antigens. By coating <b>the</b> <b>pathogen,</b> antibodies stimulate effector functions against <b>the</b> <b>pathogen</b> in cells that recognize their Fc region.|$|E

40|$|Smoking is an {{independent}} risk factor for the initiation, extent and severity of periodontal disease. This study examined {{the ability of the}} host immune system to discriminate commensal oral bacteria from pathogens at mucosal surfaces, i. e. oral cavity. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody reactive with three pathogenic and five commensal oral bacteria in 301 current smokers (age range 21 â€“ 66 years) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Clinical features of periodontal health were used as measures of periodontitis. Antibody to <b>the</b> <b>pathogens</b> and salivary cotinine levels were related positively to disease severity; however, the antibody levels were best described by the clinical disease unrelated to the amount of smoking. The data showed a greater immune response to pathogens than commensals that was related specifically to disease extent, and most noted in black males. Significant correlations in individual patient responses to <b>the</b> <b>pathogens</b> and commensals were lost with an increasing extent of periodontitis and serum antibody to <b>the</b> <b>pathogens.</b> Antibody to Porphyromonas gingivalis was particularly distinct with respect to the discriminatory nature of the immune responses in recognizing <b>the</b> <b>pathogens.</b> Antibody responses to selected pathogenic and commensal oral microorganisms differed among racial groups and genders. The antibody response to <b>the</b> <b>pathogens</b> was related to disease severity. The level of antibody to <b>the</b> <b>pathogens,</b> and in particular P. gingivalis, was correlated with disease severity in black and male subsets of patients. The amount of smoking did not appear to impact directly serum antibody levels to these oral bacteria...|$|R

5|$|The {{immune system}} protects organisms from {{infection}} with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses {{from entering the}} organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of <b>the</b> <b>pathogen.</b> This improved response is then retained after <b>the</b> <b>pathogen</b> has been eliminated, {{in the form of}} an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.|$|E

5|$|In late 1998, 120â€“130 tammar {{wallabies}} {{died suddenly}} in research facilities and zoos in New South Wales and Queensland, perishing less than twelve hours after exhibiting the first symptoms, with most exhibiting no symptoms at all. Post mortem examination revealed haemorrhage of muscle, and abdominal and thoracic organs. The syndrome {{is known as}} tammar sudden death syndrome and <b>the</b> <b>pathogen</b> is an orbivirus of the family Reoviridae. It does not occur south of Sydney. Captive populations of tammar wallabies in New South Wales have subsequently suffered infections in summer months. No treatment has been attempted due to the rapid progression of the disease.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of normal immune response, parts of {{pathogens}} (e.g. bacteria) are recognized by the immune system as foreign (non-self), and eliminated or effectively neutralized to reduce their potential damage. Such a recognizable substance is called an antigen. The immune system may respond in multiple ways to an antigen; a key feature of this response is the production of antibodies by B cells (or B lymphocytes) involving {{an arm of the}} immune system known as humoral immunity. The antibodies are soluble and do not require direct cell-to-cell contact between <b>the</b> <b>pathogen</b> and the B-cell to function.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of phosphite inhibits growth of P.cinnamomi in B.sessilis, {{but does not}} kill <b>the</b> <b>pathogen.</b> In one study, a foliar spray containing phosphite inhibited the growth of P.cinnamomi by over 90% in plants infected with B.sessilis two weeks after spraying, and by 66% in plants infected one year after spraying; yet most plants infected shortly before or after spraying were dead 100 days later, while nearly all plants infected seven months later spraying survived a further 100 days. Phosphite is not known to affect plant growth, but {{has been shown to}} reduce pollen fertility: one study recorded fertility reductions of up to 50%, and, in a separate experiment, fertility reductions that persisted for more than a year.|$|E

40|$|A disease complex {{involving}} Meloidogyne incognita and Fusarium solani was studied on tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum, Mill.) under glasshouse conditions. Pot {{experiments were}} conducted to determine the pathogenesis of both <b>the</b> <b>pathogens</b> individually, simultaneously and sequentially. Isolates of M. incognita and F. solani singly caused {{a significant reduction in}} plant height, fresh weight, dry weight, number of fruits and fruit weight over the un-inoculated one but the reduction was more by M. incognita as compared to F. solani. A significant reduction in different plant growth parameters was observed on simultaneous and sequential inoculation of M. incognita and F. solani. However, the reduction was more prominent on simultaneous inoculation of both <b>the</b> <b>pathogens.</b> Among <b>the</b> sequential inoculations more damages were assessed during inoculation of M. incognita followed by F. solani (N+f 10). Nematode multiplication, number of galls and number of females were adversely affected on simultaneous and sequential inoculation of both <b>the</b> <b>pathogens</b> in all <b>the</b> treatments. In the present study it was concluded that both <b>the</b> <b>pathogens</b> viz M. incognita and F. solani are virulent against the tomato c. v pusa ruby and therefore measures {{to prevent the spread of}} disease become important...|$|R
5|$|The {{success of}} any {{pathogen}} {{depends on its}} ability to elude host immune responses. Therefore, pathogens evolved several methods that allow them to successfully infect a host, while evading detection or destruction by the immune system. Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier, for example, by using a type II secretion system. Alternatively, using a type III secretion system, they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell, providing a direct route for proteins to move from <b>the</b> <b>pathogen</b> to the host. These proteins are often used to shut down host defenses.|$|E
5|$|Though it {{was known}} {{in the nineteenth century}} that {{bacteria}} are the cause of many diseases, no effective antibacterial treatments were available. In 1910, Paul Ehrlich developed the first antibiotic, by changing dyes that selectively stained Treponema pallidumâ€”the spirochaete that causes syphilisâ€”into compounds that selectively killed <b>the</b> <b>pathogen.</b> Ehrlich had been awarded a 1908 Nobel Prize for his work on immunology, and pioneered the use of stains to detect and identify bacteria, with his work being the basis of the Gram stain and the Ziehlâ€“Neelsen stain.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial infections may {{be treated}} with antibiotics, which are {{classified}} as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits {{a process that is}} different in <b>the</b> <b>pathogen</b> from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilised to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.|$|E
