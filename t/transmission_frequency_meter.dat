40|$|Results are {{presented}} of further {{analyses of the}} significant effects of reciprocal crosses reported by Katz and Cardellino (1978) in regard to viability indices of wild-type second chromosome heterozygotes.

30|$|The {{frequency}} domain electromagnetic method {{has already been}} widely used for tomographic imaging or electromagnetic well logging. However, different from open hole logging, the metal casing existing in production well logging has a strong shielding effect on the electromagnetic waves, thus bringing some difficulties to {{the application of the}} {{frequency domain}} electromagnetic method in production well logging. According to the relation of the field source geometry to the ring around the mandrel, the general expressions of frequency domain electromagnetic responses in axially symmetrical layered conductive medium are deduced. The propagation effects caused by the low-frequency electromagnetic waves in cased hole are also analyzed. The distribution curves of eddy current density and magnetic flux density along the radial direction in the mandrel indicate that the eddy loss within the mandrel is proportional to the <b>transmission</b> signal <b>frequency</b> and the mandrel conductivity. The secondary field responses of different casing materials show that the <b>transmission</b> <b>frequency</b> has an important effect on the ability of electromagnetic waves penetrating the metal casing. The <b>transmission</b> <b>frequency</b> should be ultra-low in order to enable the electromagnetic signal to penetrate the casing easily. The numerical results of frequency responses for different casing physical parameters show that the casing thickness has {{a significant impact on the}} choice of the <b>transmission</b> <b>frequency.</b> It is also found that the effect of the casing radius on the <b>transmission</b> <b>frequency</b> can be neglected.|$|R

(2) <b>Transmission</b> <b>frequency</b> and progeny production of the T- 007 heterozygous females were normal, or at least almost normal.

30|$|Many {{research}} {{works in}} recent years have sought to overcome transmission latency. These works proposed broadcast <b>transmission</b> <b>frequency</b> adjustment methods to overcome this issue [13, 18, 19]. Moreover, many other research works have proposed broadcast transmission power adjustment methods to overcome the problem [12, 20, 21]. However, not only <b>transmission</b> <b>frequency</b> adjustment methods but also transmission power adjustment methods are needed to obtain more information, to decide the optimal rate or frequency control, such as feedback information from neighbouring cars, or to monitor the broadcast condition immediately. This paper proposes a system that reduces the repeated and derivable information between the broadcast messages, thus solving the time-critical issue.

40|$|Detecting the {{frequency}} of the mains supply is a crucial component of maintaining the grid frequency at its nominal level. Most frequency counters enable the user to monitor frequencies but monitoring frequency variations at a high resolution is often expensive. Electronic systems that measure frequency also have to generate a local time base to calculate {{the frequency}} upon. All time bases suffer from the effect of frequency jitter, which makes the timing source deviate from the nominal second by a quantified amount. Modern systems have improved drastically and have relatively insignificant jitter for most timing applications, but high-precision applications require a quantification of this source of timing error. The purpose of this thesis is to document the background, implementation, testing, results and identified future improvements for a <b>frequency</b> <b>meter</b> that can record minor fluctuations of the grid frequency. By achieving this objective, the grid supply and demand data can be logged and used for several applications, such as network forecasting or maintaining nominal grid frequency. An extensive research period was required to determine key design facets pertaining to the <b>frequency</b> <b>meter.</b> Key identified tasks included choosing a timing source, finding a suitable software development platform and associated hardware, developing a graphical software implementation that displays real-time frequency fluctuations, contingency alarming for nominal frequency deviation events, communications design between the <b>frequency</b> <b>meter</b> and the PC, quantifying clock precision and evaluating the performance of the final <b>frequency</b> <b>meter.</b> A GPS time source was chosen to provide an accurate source of 1 second pulses. An Arduino Due microcontroller used a KX- 7 quartz crystal oscillator to maintain its time base and the accuracy of the KX- 7 ’s time base was analysed against the Trimble Copernicus II and GlobalSat EM 406 -A GPS receivers’ time base. When analysed relative to the GPS receivers’ accurate time base, the KX- 7 maintained a low time base variation, well within it’s data sheet specifications. The Arduino Due microcontroller was programmed and provided relevant frequency data to a LabVIEW PC terminal, which allowed frequency visualisation, data storage, grid frequency contingency detection, recovery time logging, GPS initialisation data and cross-platform communication protocols. Frequency data was logged on the <b>frequency</b> <b>meter</b> and was able to provide a microHertz resolution. The primary limitation of the design was low-level noise on the mains supply line as this affected the designed electronics when logging frequency measurements below the milliHertz range. Multiple recommendations for future work have been identified and included in this report...|$|R
