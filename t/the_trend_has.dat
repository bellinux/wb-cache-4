5|$|Electricity {{is a very}} {{convenient}} way {{to transfer}} energy, {{and it has been}} adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories. Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> <b>has</b> started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector.|$|E

5|$|Other human {{impacts on}} the {{atmosphere}} include the air pollution in cities, the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain, and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer. Anthropogenic particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance and reflectance (albedo) of the Earth's surface. Known as global dimming, the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> <b>has</b> subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Sunniland <b>Trend</b> (Trend) {{in south}} Florida is an arcuate trend about 235 {{kilometers}} long by 30 kilometers wide that has supported oil production from the Sunniland Formation for over 60 years. The individual oil fields within <b>the</b> <b>Trend</b> <b>have</b> average porosities that range 15 – 18 %, {{and have the}} potential to serve as carbon dioxide (CO 2) sequestration reservoirs due to their high porosity and proven ability to trap hydrocarbons for millennia. In addition, the non-oil-bearing porous intervals of the Sunniland Formation along <b>the</b> <b>Trend</b> <b>have</b> relatively high porosities as well, with an average porosity range of 10 – 20 %. All of the porous intervals in the Sunniland Formation within the extent of <b>the</b> <b>Trend,</b> including <b>the</b> oil-bearing intervals, {{have the potential to}} store ∼ 1. 2 billion tons of CO 2, which could potentially support CO 2 sequestration for multiple large-scale power plants in the southeastern United States for their entire 40 -year lifespan.

25|$|An {{important}} contribution to the decline of Swedish speakers in Finland {{during the second half}} of the 20th century was that many Swedish speakers emigrated to Sweden. An estimated 30% – 50% of all Finnish citizens who moved to Sweden were Swedish-speaking Finns. Reliable statistics are not available, as the Swedish authorities, as opposed to their Finnish counterpart, do not register languages. Another reason is that the natural increase of the Finnish-speakers has been somewhat faster than that of the Swedish-speakers until recent times, when <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> <b>has</b> reversed.|$|E
