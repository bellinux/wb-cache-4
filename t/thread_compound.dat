50|$|Pipes are {{commonly}} joined by welding, using threaded pipe and fittings; sealing {{the connection with}} a pipe <b>thread</b> <b>compound,</b> Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Thread seal tape, oakum, or PTFE string, or by using a mechanical coupling. Process piping is usually joined by welding using a TIG or MIG process. The most common process pipe joint is the butt weld. The ends of pipe to be welded must have a certain weld preparation called an End Weld Prep (EWP) which is typically at an angle of 37.5 degrees to accommodate the filler weld metal. The most common pipe thread in North America is the National Pipe Thread (NPT) or the Dryseal (NPTF) version. Other pipe threads include the British standard pipe thread (BSPT), the garden hose thread (GHT), and the fire hose coupling (NST).|$|E
40|$|The modern {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} of America has seen most of the high quality, easily obtainable resources, already produced, thus causing wells to be drilled deeper in search for unconventional resources. This means Oil Country Tubular Goods (OCTG) must improve in order to withstand harsher conditions; especially the ability of connections to effectively create leak tight seals. This study investigates the use of thread connections in tight gas fields; therefore, an insight into their potential to contribute to fulfilling the energy demands is necessary. Also, a survey of completed projects done in tight gas fields can provide vital information that will establish the minimum requirements thread connection must meet to perform its functions. To make suitable adjustments to ensure safe and efficient operations we must thoroughly understand the many aspects of thread connections. To have this understanding, a review of previous works was carried out that highlights the capabilities and imitations of thread connections. In addition to reviewing previous work done on thread connections; this study measured the viscosity of thread compounds under variable conditions. It was found that viscosity of <b>thread</b> <b>compound</b> falls in the range of 285, 667 cP and 47, 758 cP when measured between 32. 9 degrees F and 121. 5 degrees F. This can be very important because <b>thread</b> <b>compound</b> is essential to the function of thread connections. The knowledge of its viscosity can help choose the most suitable compound. By knowing the value of the viscosity of a <b>thread</b> <b>compound</b> it {{can also be used to}} form an analytical assessment of the grooved plate method by providing a means to calculate a pressure gradient which impacts the leakage...|$|E
40|$|A tire is an {{essential}} part on a vehicle. Different tires have different properties, {{and one of them is}} the longitudinal stiffness of the tire. Tire stiffness can be explained by modelling the tire as small <b>thread</b> <b>compounds.</b> These small <b>thread</b> <b>compounds</b> will have contact with the surface and will contain one adhesion and one sliding region.

40|$|When {{establishing}} oil wells, pipe sections {{are connected}} {{by means of}} threaded couplings. In an effort to minimize the possibility of failure by jumpout, standard buttress connections were introduced. Part of their strength is directly acquired {{as a result of}} radial interference during make-up. This paper discusses the results of a numerical study evaluating the effect of make-up on the performance of a standard 4. 5 inch API buttress connection when axial tensile force is applied. In order to characterize the structural performance, the load distribution along the coupling length is evaluated, combined with a parameter defining thread separation. The latter is indicative for jumpout and the tendency of creating a leak path throughout the thread helix. From the results it is clear that relative axial displacement within the coupling occurs, even when made up, because of an initial clearance among the load and stab flanks. This clearance may cause a connection to leak through the thread helix when available <b>thread</b> <b>compound</b> cannot heal this leak path. Despite undesirable effects on the sealability and rigidness of this joint, such a clearance is required to decrease frictional forces during make-up while maintaining the desired radial interference...|$|E

This research {{is focused on}} the wear resistance and lubricity performance of boron powders. Experimental approach was used in this research. Several experiments were conducted including API RP 7 A 1 <b>thread</b> <b>compound</b> test, pin-on-disk tribometer experiment, stribeck curve analysis and surface analysis. It is possible to obtain fundamental principles of boron powder as additives in lubricants from these experiments. The results indicate that amorphous boron powder is beneficial for lubricants additive, while crystalline boron powder showed that it is not proper as an additive, since {{there were a lot of}} traces of abrasive wear. According to the results amorphous boron powder provided anti-wear and better lubricity properties in the lubricants. The observation and understanding obtained here will be beneficial for the lubrication industry. This research will provide basic principle of boron powder and possibilities of boron powder as additive in lubricants. This thesis is composed of six chapters. The first chapter is about general ideas of lubrication from problems to emulsion techniques, followed by chapter II, motivation and objectives.

40|$|Stress Engineering Services (SES) was {{contracted}} by Mr. John Watts to {{test his}} threaded connection developed for oilfield oil and gas service. This particular test required {{the application of a}} variety of loads including axial tension and compression, internal pressure (gas), external pressure (water), bending and both low and elevated temperature. These loads were used to determine the sealing and structural limits of the connection. The connection design tested had tapered threads with 10 threads per inch. A square thread form and a round thread form were tested. The square thread form had a 2 {sup o} load flank and 15 {sup o} stab flank. The round thread had a 0 {sup o} load flank and 20 {sup o} stab flank. Most of the testing was performed on the round thread form. Both a coupled connection design and an integral connection design were tested. The coupling was a pin by pin (male) thread, with the pipe having a box (female) thread. Both designs have outside and inside diameters that are flush with the pipe body. Both designs also contain a small external shoulder. The test procedure selected for this evaluation was the newly written ISO 13679 procedure for full scale testing of casing and tubing connections. The ISO procedure requires a variety of tests that includes makeup/breakout testing, internal gas sealability/external water sealability testing with axial tension, axial compression, bending, internal gas thermal cycle tests and limit load (failure) tests. This test was performed with four coupled samples and included most of these loads. Two integral samples were also included for limit load testing ISO makeup/breakout tests are divided into three types [...] initial makeup, IML 1, repeated makeup within the same sample, MBL, and repeated makeup using several samples called round robin, RR. IMU and MBL were performed in this project. The ISO sealing and structural procedure is divided into four primary tests and identified as Series A, B, C and Limit Load (failure). Series A and B test to 95 % actual yield of the pipe and Series C uses 90 % of actual yield. Samples 1 and 3 were tested to Series A and the loads are shown in Figure 1. For these samples, the axial compression was limited to 75 % pipe body yield, which was set by Mr. Watts {{at the beginning of the}} test. Samples 2 and 4 were tested to Series B with loads shown in Figure 2. This series included 20 degrees per 100 feet bending but no external pressure. Due to premature leaks, no samples were subjected to Series C which included mechanical and thermal cycles. Samples 5 and 6 were tested to failure. The project started with the selection and purchase of a popular size of oilfield pipe, which was 7 -inch OD, 32 pound per foot, P- 110 casing. While the connections were being threaded, material tensile tests were performed to get the actual strength of the 7 -inch pipe. The first samples contained a square thread form. Excessive galling was experienced during the first series of makeup/breakout tests and Mr. Watts decided to change the thread form and remachine the samples. The second samples had a round thread form and performed very well in the makeup/breakout tests. Basically no galling occurred of any consequence. Samples 1 and 3 were to be tested with external water (ISO Series A) while samples 2 and 4 were to be tested with bending (ISO Series B, no external pressure). Testing of all four samples started with tension and internal gas pressure. During this initial pressure testing, samples 1, 3 and 4 developed leaks and the test was stopped before any external pressure or bending was applied. Sample 2 successfully tested to ISO Load Point 5 which included bending before developing a leak. Figure 3 shows the loads at which the samples leaked and the relative pipe body performance capability. Sample 1 and end A of sample 2 held a high pressure while samples 3, 4 and end B of sample 2 leaked at relatively low pressures. All of these leaks were with nitrogen gas pressure. After reviewing the results, it was believed that several conditions may have contributed to the premature leaks: The BOL 2000 thread lubricant contains solid particles that are larger than the solid particles in API 5 A 2 compound. Possibly the large particles prevented tight thread contact necessary for gas leak tightness. The BOL 2000 lubricant may have caused or at least contributed to the yielding of the pin end during makeup. Pin inward deformation was found in some pins subsequent to testing and breakout. Excessive yielding of the pin or box will contribute to poor thread contact and leakage. The connections were made up to full or near full shoulder contact. This causes the end of the pin to be stressed near the yield strength. This along with the interference caused by the <b>thread</b> <b>compound</b> may cause excessive pin hoop stresses and yielding which in turn gives relatively loose thread contact. This behavior is present when repeated makeup and breakout occurs...|$|E

50|$|Pipe dope is any thread lubricant, <b>thread</b> sealing <b>compound,</b> and {{anaerobic}} chemical sealants {{that are}} used to make a pipe thread joint leak proof and pressure tight. Although common pipe threads are tapered and therefore will achieve an interference fit during proper assembly, machining and finishing variances usually result in a fit that does not result in 100 percent contact between the mating components. The application of pipe dope prior to assembly will fill the minute voids between the threads, thus making the joint pressure tight. Pipe dope also acts as a lubricant and helps prevent seizing of the mating parts, which can later cause difficulty during disassembly.|$|R

40|$|Threading {{intercalation}} is {{an unusual}} DNA binding mode with significantly slower association and dissociation rates compared with classical intercalation. The latter {{has been shown to}} correlate well with cytotoxicity, and therefore, <b>threading</b> intercalating <b>compounds</b> are of great interest in the search for new DNA binding drugs. Thus, {{there is a need for}} better understanding of the mechanisms behind this type of binding. In this work, we have investigated the threading intercalation ability, of the four stereoisomers of the AT-specific binuclear ruthenium complex [mu-dppzip(phen) (4) Ru(2) ](4 +) using different spectroscopic techniques. This complex contains an unsymmetrical bridging ligand consisting of a dipyridophenazine and an imidazophenanthroline ring system, in which the photophysical properties of the Ru-dipyridophenazine complex moiety make it possible to distinguish the intercalating part from the nonintercalating part We have found that Delta geometry around the ruthenium on the intercalating dipyridophenazine moiety and Lambda geometry on the nonintercalating imidazophenanthroline moiety is the optimal configuration for threading intercalation Of this complex and that the chirality on the ruthenium of the nonintercalating half dominates the stereospecificity in the threaded state. This is the cause of the reversed enantioselectivity compared with the parent threading intercalating complex [mu-bidppz(phen) (4) Ru(2) ](4 +), in which the enantioselectivity is controlled by the chirality on the intercalating half. The differences in the interactions with DNA between the two, complexes are most likely due to the fact that [mu-dppzip(phen) (4) Ru(2) ](4 +) has a slightly shorter bridging ligand than the parent complex...|$|R

40|$|Rotaxane stellen eine interessante Verbindungsklasse in der Supramolekularen Chemie dar. Diese supramolekularen Strukturen können durch Auffädeln einer Ringkomponente auf eine hantelförmige Achse aufgebaut werden. Das Besondere an Rotaxanen ist die mechanische, nicht kovalente Bindung des Ringes an die Hantelkomponente, weswegen sie als molekulare Shuttle-Systeme sowie für den gerichteten Stofftransport von großem Interesse sind. Im Rahmen des Sonderforschungs-bereiches SFB 677 „Funktion durch Schalten“ sollte eine lichtgetriebene Protonenpumpe auf Rotaxanbasis synthetisiert werden. Die Achse des Rotaxans sollte über zwei Bindestelle (Amid- und Carbonylfunktion) sowie über eine permante {{positive}} Ladung die Bewegung des Makrozyklus steuern. Außerdem sollte der Makrozyklus protonierbar sein, um Protonen von der einen zur anderen Seite des Rotaxans zu transportieren. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit konnten zwei verschiedene Achsen 33 und 34 mit einer permanenten positiven Ladung sowie den gewünschten Bindestellen Amid- und Carbonylfunktion synthetisiert werden. Außerdem konnten unterschiedlich große Makrozyklen 8 a-c erhalten werden. Die Hantelkomponenten 33 und 34 sowie die Makrozyklen 8 a-c wurden anschließend für die Synthese des Rotaxans nach dem slipping-Verfahren eingesetzt. Allerdings führten die slipping-Versuche nicht zum gewünschten [2]-Rotaxan. Aus diesem Grund wurde alternativ die trapping-Methode eingesetzt. Über eine Kupfer-katalysierte „click-Reaktion“ konnten die Rotaxane 50 und 62 erhalten werden. Allerdings ließ sich nur das Rotaxan 62 mit einer verlängerten Alkinkomponente isolieren. NMR-spektroskopische Untersuchungen konnten zeigen, dass die Ringkomponente durch den Zusatz von Säure zur zweiten Bindestelle geschaltet werden kann. In der lichtgetriebenen Protonenpumpe sollen die Protonen durch Tautomerisierung einer photoschaltbaren Säure erzeugt werden. Damit die Protonen auf den Makrozyklus übertragen werden können, muss die photoschaltbare Einheit an geeigneter Stelle in das Rotaxan integriert werden. Hierfür wurden vier verschiedene Photosäuren auf o-Nitrotoluolbasis synthetisiert und mit Pyridin-Stopper-Einheiten verknüpft. Rotaxanes {{represent an}} interesting class of compounds in supramolecular chemistry. These supramolecular structures {{could be obtained}} via <b>threading</b> a ring <b>compound</b> on a dumbbell-shaped axis. Due {{to the fact that}} the ring and the axis are not connected covalently, but mechanically interlocked, rotaxanes increasingly come into the focus of interest for the development of molecular shuttle systems as well as for electron and energy transfer or the transport of protons. Within the scope of the Collaborative Research Center (SFB 677) ”Function by Switching”, a rotaxane had to be synthesized acting as a light driven proton pump. Two different binding sites (an amide and a carbonyl function) as well as a permanent positive charge within the axis should control the movement of the macrocycle. In order to transport the proton from one recognition site of the rotaxane to the other, the ring has to contain a tertiary protonable amine. Two different axes 33 and 34 were synthesized with a permanent positive charge and the desired binding sites, amide and carbonyl function. In addition, three macrocycles 8 a-c of different size were synthesized. Rotaxane formation experiments were carried out via a slipping process using the dumbbell-shaped units 33 and 34 as well as the ring compounds 8 a-c. But no rotaxane could be obtained by this procedure. Alternatively the trapping method was used for rotaxane formation. Via copper catalysed click reaction, two rotaxanes 50 and 62 were synthesized. But only the compound 62 with a longer axis could be isolated. Rotaxane 62 was investigated via NMR spectroscopy. NMR spectra showed that the addition of acid to the rotaxane solution forces the macrocycle to move to the other binding site. In the light driven proton pump, protons are planned to be generated by the tautomerization of a photoswitchable acid. To transfer the proton from the acid to the ring compound, the photoswitchable unit has to be integrated into the rotaxane close to the pyridine ring of the axis. Therefore four different photo acids based on o-nitrotoluene were synthesized and connected to pyridine stopper units...|$|R
