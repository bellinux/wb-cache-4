5|$|The {{location}} {{selected for}} the barrow had witnessed inhabitation during the preceding Mesolithic period, as evidenced by a nearby hearth and scatters of knapped flint tools. Built out of earth and local sarsen megaliths, the long barrow consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen <b>tumulus.</b> Within {{the eastern end of}} the <b>tumulus</b> was a stone chamber, into which human remains were deposited, alongside sherds of pottery vessels.|$|E
5|$|A large <b>tumulus</b> of {{uncertain}} {{origin and}} purpose stands approximately {{in the middle}} of the excavated area, between the old and new parts of the city. Various theories have been advanced to explain it, such as that it was a burial site, a religious structure of some kind, a funerary monument or a monument to a Roman victory. However, these remain unproven hypotheses.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{tradition is}} that of the ship burial, where the deceased was laid in a boat, or a stone ship, and given grave offerings in accordance with his earthly status and profession, sometimes including sacrificed slaves. Afterwards, piles of stone and soil were usually laid on top of the remains {{in order to create a}} <b>tumulus.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Denmark {{has about}} 20,000 {{preserved}} <b>tumuli,</b> with the oldest being around 5,000 years old. A {{great number of}} <b>tumuli</b> in Denmark has been destroyed {{in the course of}} history, ploughed down for agricultural fields or used for road or dyke constructions. <b>Tumuli</b> has been protected by law since 1937 and is officially supervised by the Danish Agency for Culture.

5|$|Built out {{of earth}} and around fifty local sarsen megaliths, the long barrow {{consisted}} of a sub-rectangular earthen <b>tumulus</b> enclosed by kerb-stones. Within {{the eastern end of}} the <b>tumulus</b> was a stone chamber, into which human remains were deposited on at least two separate occasions during the Early Neolithic. Osteoarchaeological analysis of these remains has shown them to be those of at least seventeen individuals, a mixture of men, women, children and adults. At least one of the bodies had been dismembered before burial, potentially reflecting a funerary tradition of excarnation and secondary burial. As with other barrows, Coldrum has been interpreted as a tomb to house the remains of the dead, perhaps as part of a belief system involving ancestor veneration, although archaeologists have suggested that it may also have had further religious, ritual, and cultural connotations and uses.|$|E
5|$|Addington Long Barrow is a {{chambered}} long barrow {{located near}} {{to the village of}} Addington in the southeastern English county of Kent. Constructed during Britain's Early Neolithic period, today it survives only in a ruined state. Built out of earth and around fifty local sarsen megaliths, the long barrow consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen <b>tumulus</b> enclosed by kerb-stones. Collapsed stones on the northeastern end of the chamber probably represented a stone chamber in which human remains might have been deposited; none, however, have been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ilicifolia is a {{component}} of the critically endangered Assemblage of <b>Tumulus</b> Springs (organic mound springs) of the Swan Coastal Plain community north of Perth, which is characterised by a permanently moist peaty soil. The dominant trees include M. preissiana, swamp banksia (B. littoralis) and flooded gum (Eucalyptus rudis), with understorey ferns such as bracken (Pteridium esculentum) and Cyclosorus interruptus, and shrubs swamp peppermint (Taxandria linearifolia) and Astartea fascicularis.|$|E

5|$|Evidence of {{activity}} in the Quantocks from prehistoric times includes finds of Mesolithic flints at North Petherton and Broomfield and many Bronze Age round barrows (marked on maps as <b>tumulus,</b> plural tumuli), such as Thorncombe Barrow above Bicknoller. Several ancient stones can be seen, such as the Triscombe Stone and the Long Stone above Holford. Many of the tracks along ridges of the Quantocks probably originated as ancient ridgeways. A Bronze Age hill fort, Norton Camp, was built to the south at Norton Fitzwarren, close to the centre of bronze making in Taunton.|$|E
5|$|In the 3rd century, {{imperial}} mausolea {{began to}} be built as domed rotundas rather than <b>tumulus</b> structures or other types, following similar monuments by private citizens. Pagan and Christian domed mausolea from this time can be differentiated in that the structures of the buildings also reflect their religious functions. The pagan buildings are typically two story, dimly lit, free-standing structures with a lower crypt area for the remains and an upper area for devotional sacrifice. Christian domed mausolea contain a single well-lit space and are usually attached to a church.|$|E
5|$|Ine {{fought a}} battle at Woden's Barrow in 715, either against the Mercians under Ceolred or {{together}} with them against an unnamed opponent; {{the result is}} not recorded. Woden's Barrow is a <b>tumulus,</b> now called Adam's Grave, at Alton Prior, Wiltshire. Ine may not have recovered any of the lands north of the Thames {{that had belonged to}} the West Saxons under previous kings, but it is known that he controlled the southern bank: a charter dated 687 shows him giving land to the church at Streatley on the Thames and at nearby Basildon.|$|E
50|$|Prehistoric and Protohistoric {{remnants}} {{have been}} found, {{many in the}} valleys above Cauterets: Eleven stone circles, four cromlech <b>tumuli,</b> six individual <b>tumuli</b> and five dolmens.

5|$|There are 35 royal tombs and 155 <b>tumuli</b> {{in central}} Gyeongju, and 421 <b>tumuli</b> in the {{outskirts}} of the city. Silla burial mounds built after the period of the Three Kingdoms are found in central Gyeongju, including <b>tumuli</b> in the districts of Noseo-dong, Nodong-dong, Hwangnam-dong, Hwango-dong and Inwang-dong. Western Gyeongju has the tomb of King Muyeol in Seoak-dong, nearby <b>tumuli</b> in Chunghyo-dong and the tomb of Kim Yu-sin. The tombs of Queen Seondeok, King Sinmun, King Hyogong and King Sinmu are at the base of Namsan mountain while the tombs of King Heongang, King Jeonggang, King Gyeongmyeong and King Gyeongae are on the slopes of the mountain. In addition to the tombs, <b>tumuli</b> have been found surrounding Namsan mountain and {{in the western part of}} Geumgang mountain. Artifacts excavated from the tombs of Geumgwanchong (gold crown tomb), Seobongchong (western phoenix tomb), Cheonmachong (heavenly horse tomb) and northern and southern parts of Tomb No. 98 are good examples of Silla culture.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} known settlement trace in Weinsberg is a {{group of}} <b>tumuli.</b> They're situated in the forest near the boundary to Heilbronn and haven't been investigated so far. It is assumed that the <b>tumuli</b> are to be assigned to the Hallstatt culture.|$|R
5|$|The {{study of}} place names in Chadderton {{suggests}} that the ancient Britons once inhabited the area. Remains of Roman roads have been discovered running through the town, and the local road name Streetbridge {{suggests that the}} Romans once marched along it on a path which {{may have led to}} Blackstone Edge. Relics found at a <b>tumulus</b> in Chadderton Fold date from the Early Middle Ages, probably from the early period of Anglo-Saxon England, when Angles settled in the area and Chadderton emerged as a manor of the hundred of Salford.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} {{carried out}} before the flooding of Chew Valley Lake found evidence of people belonging to the consecutive periods known as Upper Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic (Old, Middle and New Stone Age), Bronze Age and Iron Age, comprising implements such as stone knives, flint blades {{and the head of}} a mace, along with buildings and graves. Other evidence of occupation from prehistoric times is provided by the henge monument at Stanton Drew, long barrow at Chewton Mendip, and Fairy Toot <b>tumulus</b> at Nempnett Thrubwell. Maes Knoll fort, on Dundry Down in the northern reaches of the valley, is a Scheduled Ancient Monument that dates from the Iron Age; it later served as a terminus for the early medieval Wansdyke earthworks.|$|E
5|$|Pyrrhus {{lost much}} of his support among the Macedonians in 273 BC when his unruly Gallic mercenaries plundered the royal {{cemetery}} of Aigai. Pyrrhus pursued Antigonus II in Greece, yet while he was occupied with {{the war in the}} Peloponnese, Antigonus II was able to recapture Macedonia. While battling for control over Argos in 272 BC, Pyrrhus was killed while fighting in the city's streets, allowing Antigonus II to reclaim Greece as well. He then restored the Argead dynastic graves at Aigai by constructing a massive <b>tumulus.</b> Antigonus II also secured the Illyrian front and annexed Paeonia.|$|E

5|$|The land {{on which}} the circle is located slopes down from east to west. The topsoil {{in and around the}} site is peaty and has heather growing across it. From the circle, a range of {{different}} Bronze Age round barrows, or tumuli, are visible at different points in the surrounding landscape. 261.5 meters (286 yards) to the north-east of the circle, atop the summit of Withypool Hill, is a lone <b>tumulus,</b> although this can no longer be seen from Withypool Stone Circle itself. The three Brightworthy Barrows {{can be seen from the}} circle in a north-west direction. Other Bronze Age barrows visible from the circle are the Green Barrow, the Old Barrow, the Twitchen Barrows, the three Wam Barrows of Winsford Hill, and the barrow atop Sherdon.|$|E
5|$|Others {{have argued}} that the {{cemetery}} represents a fusion of Christian and pagan Saxon customs. It was not {{until the end of the}} 7th century that the practice of burying people in consecrated ground around a church became the norm. There are examples of known Christians being buried in an ostensibly pagan fashion, as was the case for the late 7th century Kentish princess Eormengyth, sister of the abbess of Minster-in-Thanet. She was buried in a traditional <b>tumulus</b> a mile east of her sister's minster. John Blair argues that the Church in early Saxon England may have tolerated Christians being given pagan burial rites due to the 'Christianising' effect this would have had on a pagan site. This would have been consistent with the advice given by Pope Gregory the Great in 601 that Saxon shrines should be converted to Christian use, rather than being destroyed, and that pagan festivals and rites should be converted into Christian ones. On this interpretation, the cemetery may symbolise the continuity between the pagan past and the increasingly Christianised present.|$|E
5|$|The usual form of burial {{during this}} period was inhumation. The {{earliest}} Mycenaean burials were mostly in individual graves {{in the form of}} a pit or a stone-lined cist and offerings were limited to pottery and occasional items of jewellery. Groups of pit or cist graves containing elite members of the community were sometimes covered by a <b>tumulus</b> (mound) in the manner established since the Middle Helladic. It has been argued that this form dates back to the Kurgan culture; however, Mycenaean burials are in actuality an indigenous development of mainland Greece with the Shaft Graves housing native rulers. Pit and cist graves remained in use for single burials throughout the Mycenaean period alongside more elaborate family graves. The shaft graves at Mycenae within Grave Circles A and B belonging to the same period represent an alternative manner of grouping elite burials. Next to the deceased were found full sets of weapons, ornate staffs as well as gold and silver cups and other valuable objects which point to their social rank.|$|E
50|$|The {{surroundings}} of Heers {{were already}} inhabited by humans in prehistoric times. In the woods near the road Locht, {{in the direction}} of the village Steensel, are some preserved <b>tumuli</b> located.The teacher and amateur archaeologist Petrus Panken was the first to report the existence of these <b>tumuli,</b> in 1845.He searched thirteen mounds and discovered urns filled with charcoal and cremated remains.The head teacher in Veldhoven, Cornelis Rijken, also found a great number of urns in this region in 1910.The first systematic research was conducted by Albert van Giffen in 1948. The ten <b>tumuli</b> that he reconstructed are known as the Group Heibloem.The <b>tumuli</b> are originating from a period of time between the Middle Bronze Age until the Iron Age (1500 - 50 BC).|$|R
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 6th century, the scale of most keyhole-shaped kofun west from the Kantō region became smaller, the smaller [...] ("satellite") <b>tumuli</b> began to disappear, and fukiishi began to be used infrequently. Three-tiered kofun saw a strong decrease in favour of two-tiered ones. Outside of the Kantō region, haniwa stopped being used. From the end of the 6th century to {{the beginning}} of the 7th, the <b>tumuli</b> of the monarchs changed from square hōfun <b>tumuli</b> to octagonal [...] <b>tumuli.</b> Amongst these, [...] dome-shaped grave mounds made with fukiishi, such as [...] in Fuchū in Tokyo, are noteworthy. Nevertheless, during this era kofun were quickly ceding the role of central ritual building to Buddhist temples, and the adoption of rammed earth construction techniques stands out.|$|R
