40|$|A {{computer}} model to simulate coronary fluid dynamics {{has been developed}} which can give {{some insight into the}} role of hemodynamics in health and disease. Although this study focuses mainly on coronary blood flow, the complete model consists of all major branches of the systemic circulation as well as the left epicardial coronary circulation;The flow equations are obtained by integrating the one-dimensional continuity and momentum equations over the cross-section of the artery to give a relationship between the primary variables of interest, the pressure and flowrate. An arctangent model was used as a constitutive equation to describe the pressure-area relationship for the arterial wall. The distal point of each terminal branch is modeled using a lumped parameter impedance to account for all the cumulative effects of the distal vasculature. The systemic circulation <b>terminal</b> <b>impedances</b> each contain a simple constant property modified windkessel. The coronary <b>terminal</b> <b>impedances</b> are modeled using similar lumped parameter models. The first model employed was based on the waterfall concept of collapsible tube dynamics. The second model was slightly more sophisticated and was based on the intramyocardial pump concept. Unlike the systemic <b>terminal</b> <b>impedances,</b> the coronary <b>terminal</b> resistance and compliance values are allowed to vary throughout the cardiac cycle according to the extravascular compressive pressure created by the contracting myocardium. The above system of nonlinear partial differential equations was discretized using a finite difference formulation and solved numerically;Both coronary models developed could predict realistic flow patterns in the epicardial arteries. The {{computer model}} is also capable of investigating the effects of coronary stenoses with vascular bypasses on epicardial blood flow. The limitations of the model are mainly related to the assumptions needed to obtain the simplified form of the governing equations and the extensive amount of parameter data that are required. Overall, this type of model offers a useful tool for studying the fluid dynamics of the human circulation...|$|R

40|$|AUTHORS ’ SYNOPSIS The fluid {{impedance}} of the abdominal aorta {{was measured in}} anaesthetized dogs {{before and during the}} occlusion of the central branch of the aortic/external iliac junction. Aortic impedance increased during the occlusion due to a change in the <b>terminal</b> <b>impedance</b> of the peripheral beds and an increase in reflection from the aortic junction. The higher harmonics of impedance were relatively unaffected by changes in the <b>terminal</b> <b>impedance</b> and hence the increase found for these harmonics may be attributed to reflection from the junction alone. The reflection coefficient calculated from the impedance values of the higher harmonics (> 3 rd) agreed well with the theoretical value from the Womersley model of a junction set in an infinite line.

However, the network performance {{is affected by}} stochastic channel changing {{which is due to}} load impedances, number of branches and branched line lengths. It has been proposed that multi-carrier modulations techniques such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), Multi-Carrier Spread Spectrum (MC-SS), wavelet OFDM can be used in such environment. This paper investigates the performance of different indoor topologies of power-line networks that uses MC-SS modulation scheme. It is observed that when a branch is added in the link between sending and receiving end of an indoor channel an average of 2. 5 dB power loss is found. In additional, when the branch is added at a node an average of 1 dB power loss is found. Additionally when the <b>terminal</b> <b>impedances</b> of the branch change from line characteristic impedance to impedance either higher or lower values the channel performances were tremendously improved. For example changing terminal load from characteristic impedance (85 Ω) to 5 Ω the signal to noise ratio (SNR) required to attain the same performances were decreased from 37 dB to 24 dB respectively. Also, changing the terminal load from channel characteristic impedance (85 Ω) to very higher impedance (1600 Ω) the SNR required to maintain the same performances were decreased from 37 dB to 23 dB. The result concludes that MC-SS performs better compared with OFDM techniques in all aspects and especially when the channel is terminated in either higher or lower impedances.
