5|$|Because {{pure silver}} is very soft, most silver used for these {{purposes}} is alloyed with copper, with finenesses of 925/1000, 835/1000, and 800/1000 being common. One drawback is the easy <b>tarnishing</b> of {{silver in the}} presence of hydrogen sulfide and its derivatives. Including precious metals such as palladium, platinum, and gold gives resistance to <b>tarnishing</b> but is quite costly; base metals like zinc, cadmium, silicon, and germanium do not totally prevent corrosion and tend to affect the lustre and colour of the alloy. Electrolytically refined pure silver plating is effective at increasing resistance to <b>tarnishing.</b> The usual solutions for restoring the lustre of tarnished silver are dipping baths that reduce the silver sulfide surface to metallic silver, and cleaning off the layer of tarnish with a paste; the latter approach also has the welcome side effect of polishing the silver concurrently.|$|E
5|$|Chromium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Cr and atomic number 24. It {{is the first}} element in group 6. It is a steely-grey, lustrous, hard and brittle metal which takes a high polish, resists <b>tarnishing,</b> and has a high melting point. The name of the element {{is derived from the}} Greek word χρῶμα, chrōma, meaning color, because many chromium compounds are intensely colored.|$|E
5|$|The {{three main}} forms of {{deterioration}} in historical silver artifacts are <b>tarnishing,</b> formation of silver chloride due to long-term immersion in salt water, {{as well as}} reaction with nitrate ions or oxygen. Fresh silver chloride is pale yellow, becoming purplish on exposure to light; it projects slightly {{from the surface of}} the artifact or coin. The precipitation of copper in ancient silver can be used to date artifacts, as copper is nearly always a constituent of silver alloys.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tarnish</b> is a {{thin layer}} of {{corrosion}} that forms over copper, brass, silver, aluminum, magnesium and other similar metals as their outermost layer undergoes a chemical reaction. <b>Tarnish</b> does not always result from the sole effects of oxygen in the air. For example, silver needs hydrogen sulfide to <b>tarnish,</b> although it may <b>tarnish</b> with oxygen over time. It often appears as a dull, gray or black film or coating over metal. <b>Tarnish</b> is a surface phenomenon that is self-limiting, unlike rust. Only the top few layers of the metal react, and the layer of <b>tarnish</b> seals and protects the underlying layers from reacting.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{consists of}} two experimental studies investigating the influence of moral character on endorser perception, {{and the influence of}} perceiver characteristics on <b>tarnished</b> endorser perception and brand evaluations. Perceiver characteristics are discussed from the perspectives of dispositional tendency, innate moral intuitions and self-location. The first study compared the influences of moral character and warmth on endorser perception. The second study examined the impact of perceiver characteristics on <b>tarnished</b> endorsers and brand evaluations. The findings reveal that moral character is more influential than warmth on endorser evaluations. <b>Tarnished</b> endorsers with immoral character exert more negative influence than <b>tarnished</b> endorsers with coldness character on brand evaluations. Innate moral intuitions and self-location moderate brand evaluations. High-morality consumers and heart-locators are more vulnerable than low-morality and brain-locators to the brands endorsed by <b>tarnished</b> endorsers, respectively...|$|R
5|$|As {{expected}} from periodic trends, lanthanum {{has the largest}} atomic radius of the lanthanides and the stable group 3 elements. Hence, {{it is the most}} reactive among them, <b>tarnishing</b> slowly in air and burning readily to form lanthanum(III) oxide, La2O3, which is almost as basic as calcium oxide. A centimeter-sized sample of lanthanum will corrode completely in a year as its oxide spalls off like iron rust, instead of forming a protective oxide coating like aluminium and lanthanum's lighter congeners scandium and yttrium. Lanthanum reacts with the halogens at room temperature to form the trihalides, and upon warming will form binary compounds with the nonmetals nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, selenium, silicon and arsenic. Lanthanum reacts slowly with water to form lanthanum(III) hydroxide, La(OH)3. In dilute sulfuric acid, lanthanum readily forms the aquated tripositive ion : this is colorless in aqueous solution since La3+ has no f electrons. Lanthanum is the strongest and hardest base among the lanthanides and group 3 elements, which is again {{expected from}} its being the largest of them.|$|E
5|$|When {{it came to}} biography, Johnson {{disagreed}} with Plutarch's use of biography to praise and to teach morality. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the biographical subjects accurately and including any negative aspects of their lives. Because his insistence on accuracy in biography was little short of revolutionary, Johnson had to struggle against a society that was unwilling to accept biographical details that {{could be viewed as}} <b>tarnishing</b> a reputation; this became the subject of Rambler 60. Furthermore, Johnson believed that biography should not be limited to the most famous and that the lives of lesser individuals, too, were significant; thus in his Lives of the Poets he chose both great and lesser poets. In all his biographies he insisted on including what others would have considered trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects. Johnson considered the genre of autobiography and diaries, including his own, as one having the most significance; in Idler 84 he explains how a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort his own life.|$|E
5|$|The year 1912 saw {{a marked}} {{increase}} in militant action in Wales. Anger at {{the defeat of}} the Conciliation Bills saw the WPSU disrupt a speech by Lloyd George at the Pavilion in Caernarfon. The protesters, male and female, were treated harshly with clothes torn and hair ripped out and were beaten by sticks and umbrellas. Later that year Lloyd George was again heckled by suffragettes whilst delivering a speech at the National Eisteddfod. Just two weeks later {{one of the most notorious}} events in the history of suffrage in Wales took place, when Lloyd George returned to his home town of Llanystumdwy to open the village hall. No sooner had he started speaking than he was interrupted by the cries of 'Votes for Women!' The hecklers were violently assaulted by the crowd. One was stripped to the waist before being rescued and another was almost thrown off a bridge to be dashed on the rocks of the River Dwyfor below. As trouble was anticipated the national press was present and the Daily Mirror and Illustrated London News devoted a full page of photographs to the incident. The local press not only attacked the suffragettes, but poured scorn on the crowd for <b>tarnishing</b> the image of a peaceful, Nonconformist, chapel-going Wales. The event is seen as the most dramatic event in the history of Women's suffrage in Wales.|$|E
500|$|Palladium {{does not}} react with oxygen at {{standard}} temperatures (and thus does not <b>tarnish</b> in air). Palladium heated to 800°C {{will produce a}} layer of palladium(II) oxide (PdO). It <b>tarnishes</b> lightly in a moist atmosphere containing sulfur.|$|R
50|$|Using a {{thin coat}} of polish can prevent <b>tarnish</b> from forming over these metals. <b>Tarnish</b> {{can be removed}} by using steel wool, sandpaper, emery paper, baking soda or a file to rub or polish the metal's dull surface. Fine objects (such as silverware) may have the <b>tarnish</b> {{electrochemically}} reversed (non-destructively) by resting the objects {{on a piece of}} aluminium foil in a pot of boiling water {{with a small amount of}} salt or baking soda, or it may be removed with a special polishing compound and a soft cloth. Gentler abrasives, like calcium carbonate, are often used by museums to clean <b>tarnished</b> silver as they cannot damage or scratch the silver and will not leave unwanted residues.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Tarnish</b> is a {{chemical}} reaction {{on the surface}} of metal (copper, brass, silver, etc.) and causes a layer of corrosion. In the case of silver <b>tarnish,</b> the silver combines with sulfur and forms silver sulfide ( [...] Ag2S [...] ) which is black. The original silver surface can be restored if the layer of silver sulfide is removed. [...] On some metals, <b>tarnish</b> serves as a protective layer known as a patina and is typically found on copper and bronze roofing, architectural elements, statues and bells.|$|R

25|$|Fine silver, {{for example}} 99.9% pure silver, is {{relatively}} soft, so silver is usually alloyed with copper {{to increase its}} hardness and strength.
