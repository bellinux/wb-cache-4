5|$|Although much of {{this work}} has focused on {{independent}} sets in sparse graphs, a case {{that does not make}} sense for the complementary clique problem, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> work on approximation algorithms that do not use such sparsity assumptions.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> an {{increased}} emphasis on crew comfort in this class of ships with more spacious accommodation being provided. Also, INS Shivalik is the first ship in the Indian Navy with chapati- and dosa-makers on board.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> {{speculation}} of {{the identity}} of the Rival Poet. George Chapman and Christopher Marlowe, are typically considered to be the two most likely rivals, due to their publicity, profession, relations, and standing with Shakespeare during the presumed time of writing.|$|E

5|$|As of 2008, Arsenal's {{season ticket}} waiting list stood at 40,000 people. The {{potential}} for expanding the stadium {{is a common}} topic within fan debate. Potential expansion methods include, make seats smaller, filling in the dips {{in the corners of}} the stadium though this would block airflow, and replacing the roof with a third level and building a new roof. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> discussion on the implementation of safe standing.|$|E
5|$|However, under Barroso, the Commission {{began to}} lose ground to the larger member states as {{countries}} such as France, the UK and Germany sought to sideline its role. This has increased {{with the creation of}} the President of the European Council under the Treaty of Lisbon. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> a greater degree of politicisation within the Commission.|$|E
5|$|Recently, he {{has become}} a less obscure figure with the {{publication}} of several book-length biographies on him, as well as anthologies of his writings. In 2007 a literary critic for New Yorker magazine observed that five such biographies and two such anthologies had been published since 2000. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> a web page created that is dedicated to Wallace scholarship.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally {{courses in}} Piano Tuning and Piano Technology were also {{available}} at the college. However, these were significantly reduced in the late 2000s because of {{a decline in the}} number of students studying the subjects. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> a reduction in the number of A-levels available for study owing to changes in the types of courses that education funding bodies supporting students at RNC are willing to pay for.|$|E
5|$|With growing {{prosperity}} {{since the}} last decade of the 20th century, Ireland became a destination for immigrants. Since the European Union expanded to include Poland in 2004, Polish people have made up the largest number of immigrants (over 150,000) from Central Europe. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> significant immigration from Lithuania, the Czech Republic and Latvia.|$|E
5|$|Chard was a {{key point}} on the Taunton Stop Line, a World War II {{defensive}} line consisting of pillboxes and anti-tank obstacles, which runs from Axminster north to the Somerset coast near Highbridge. In 1938 a bomb proof bunker was built behind the branch of the Westminster Bank. During the war {{it was used to}} hold duplicate copies of the bank records in case its headquarters in London was destroyed. It was also used to store the emergency bank note supply of the Bank of England. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> speculation that the Crown Jewels were also stored there, however this has never been confirmed.|$|E

5|$|Deptford's {{population}} has been mainly associated with the docks since {{the establishment of the}} Royal Docks by Henry VIII, though <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> some market gardening and potteries. When the docks were thriving as the main administrative centre of the British Navy, so the area prospered, and fine houses were built for the administrative staff and the skilled shipbuilders, and a few grand houses like Sayes Court and Stone House on Lewisham Way were erected.|$|E
5|$|In this period, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> {{widespread}} cosmetic {{changes to}} stations, including {{the restoration of}} historical murals, the incorporation of new artwork and improving the lighting. The renovations on Line B have been met with criticism for destroying parts of the line's historical patrimony, which {{dates back to the}} 1930s. The appearance of the network's signage has also been changed and the new signs have been gradually replacing the old ones since November 2014.|$|E
5|$|Quyllur Rit'i also attracts {{visitors}} {{from outside the}} Paucartambo and Quispicanchis moieties. Since the 1970s, {{an increasing number of}} middle-class mainstream Peruvians undertake the pilgrimage, some of them at a different date than more traditional pilgrims. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> a rapid {{growth in the number of}} North American and European tourists drawn to the indigenous festival, prompting fears that it is becoming too commercialized.

5|$|The main {{airport for}} Roskilde is Copenhagen Airport {{which can be}} reached in about 40 minutes by train. Since April 1973, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> the small local Roskilde Airport, serving light {{aircraft}} for training, taxi, and flight instruction. There are plans to expand it for use by larger aircraft, possibly including discount international flights. The plans were approved, but lack of commitment from any carriers has postponed progress. The airport currently handles up to 100,000 operations (flights) per year, {{most of which are}} light aircraft operations associated with school flights.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> {{a general}} {{feeling of a}} shift in the {{creative}} attribution of Peking-opera works. The performer has traditionally played a large role in the scripting and staging of Peking-opera works. However, perhaps following the lead of the West, Peking opera in recent decades has shifted to a more director and playwright centered model. Performers have striven to introduce innovation in their work while heeding the call for reform from this new upper level of Peking-opera producers.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> {{extensive}} research on heuristic algorithms for solving maximum clique problems without worst-case runtime guarantees, based on methods including branch and bound, local search, greedy algorithms, and constraint programming. Non-standard computing methodologies {{that have been}} suggested for finding cliques include DNA computing and adiabatic quantum computation. The maximum clique problem {{was the subject of}} an implementation challenge sponsored by DIMACS in 1992â€“1993, and a collection of graphs used as benchmarks for the challenge is publicly available.|$|E

5|$|There was a {{hiatus of}} six years before Sebastian Faulks was {{commissioned}} to write a further Bond novel, which was released on 28 May 2008, the 100th anniversary of Ian Fleming's birth. This was followed in 2011 by a novel by American author Jeffery Deaver, a 2013 book by William Boyd and a further instalment in September 2015 by Anthony Horowitz. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> a spin-off series of books, Young Bond, based around Bond's adventures whilst a schoolboy at Eton College.|$|E
5|$|William Stokoe {{proposed}} that these components are {{analogous to the}} phonemes of spoken languages. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> a proposal that these are analogous to classes like place and manner of articulation. As in spoken languages, these phonological units can be split into distinctive features. For instance, the handshapes /2/ and /3/ are distinguished by {{the presence or absence}} of the feature , as illustrated to the right. ASL has processes of allophony and phonotactic restrictions. There is ongoing research into whether ASL has an analog of syllables in spoken language.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, brutalist {{tower blocks}} were adopted as a {{solution}} and this period saw the building of new towns, including Glenrothes and Cumbernauld, but the social and building problems of these constructions soon became apparent. The creation of new towns and council house estates necessitated the rapid supply of new churches. From the 1980s Scottish architecture began to recover its reputation, with new buildings like that created to house the Burrell Collection in Glasgow and more recently the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> urban regeneration, involving the replacement and renovation of existing buildings and landscapes. The 1980s saw the growth of speculative house building by developers {{and the introduction of}} English brick and half-timbered vernacular styles to Scotland. As the production of state sponsored housing subsided in the 1970s there was a return to conservatism in church design, but there were some original and post-modern designs from the 1980s.|$|E
