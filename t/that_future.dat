40|$|Expectations {{of housing}} prices play an {{important}} role in real estate research. Despite their importance, obtaining a reasonable proxy for such expectations is a challenge. The existing literature on mortgage research either does not include housing expectation proxies in empirical models, or uses “backward-looking” proxies such as past housing appreciation or time series forecasts based on past housing appreciation. This paper proposes to use the transaction prices of Case-Shiller housing futures as an alternative “forwardlooking” proxy. As an example, we compare the performances of four different expectation proxies in explaining mortgage default behavior. The loan level analysis shows <b>that</b> the <b>futures</b> based expectation proxy outperforms other proxies by having the highest regression model fit and being the only proxy that shows a significant negative effect on mortgage default behavior, as theory suggests. Out of sample predictions also show <b>that</b> <b>futures</b> have better prediction accuracy than other proxies. In addition, the paper shows <b>that</b> <b>futures</b> contain additional information that is not present in the backwardlooking proxies...|$|R
30|$|So in {{this paper}} I {{make the case for}} {{exploring}} a broader and more intimate realm of futures work, one which accounts for the fact that consciousness is a whole of body matter and <b>that</b> <b>futures</b> work actually regularly engages with zones of meaning making that include the physicality of enculturation and sense-making. The core argument is <b>that</b> the <b>future</b> as a zone of possibility lies on our skin like gold dust, penetrates our senses and shapes the way we express/vocalise our past-present-future consciousness.|$|R

5|$|Proponents of the Act, {{including}} Trumbull and Wilson, {{argued that}} Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment authorized {{the federal government}} to legislate civil rights for the States.

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{on the effect of}} fundamental factors upon FCOJ futures prices focused on the effect of decreases in temperature below freezing. However, a large proportion of FCOJ futures price variability remains unexplained. We recognize <b>that</b> the FCOJ <b>futures</b> contract provides an implicit quality option to the seller, by allowing delivery of the cheaper of FCOJ from Florida and FCOJ from Brazil. We value this option and show that it is a substantial percentage (14. 7 %) of FCOJ futures prices, on average. Our regression of FCOJ futures returns upon changes {{in the value of the}} option indicates <b>that</b> <b>futures</b> returns are significantly related to the option value in winter and in spring. Our results also show that the quality option provides substantial incremental (7 - 10 %) explanatory power over that provided by decreases in temperature below freezing. Our research supports the view <b>that</b> <b>futures</b> prices are largely responsive to fundamental factors...|$|R

40|$|Gold, silver, {{and copper}} futures market {{efficiency}} is examined {{by looking at}} whether futures contract prices contain useful information about future spot prices. The Fama and French (1987) regression approach is applied to test whether the futures price has forecast power on the spot price or if it contains information about the premium to be realized at maturity. The result suggests <b>that</b> the <b>futures</b> price of gold has some forecast power while the futures price of copper contains information about the time-varying premium. Unit root and co-integration analysis indicates <b>that</b> <b>futures</b> prices and spot prices of gold, silver, and copper are co-integrated at 95 % confidence level. This means <b>that</b> the <b>futures</b> contract prices are unbiased predictors of future spot prices. Thus, {{the efficiency of the}} gold, silver, and copper futures markets is supported. The univariate GARCH test finds evidence of conditional time-varying volatility for both futures and spot series. Also, positive asymmetry where positive price shocks are associated with greater volatility increases than negative price shocks is revealed. As the gold, silver and copper futures contract series and spot series are almost perfectly correlated, naïve or 1 - 1 hedging reduces almost all of the variance and realizes high hedging effectiveness. The strong correlation of futures and spot returns supports the hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>futures</b> markets are efficient. Keywords: futures; market efficiency; GARCH; hedge effectivenes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{interactional}} relationship between price volatility and futures trading activity for three heavily traded metal {{products on the}} Shanghai Metal Exchange and the Shanghai Futures Exchange.

Futures trading activity leads spot market volatility in copper and aluminium markets which suggests <b>that</b> <b>futures</b> markets have a destabilizing effect. In order to disentangle the effect of different traders’ types on asset price movements, we decompose futures trading into speculators’ and hedgers’ trading and investigate their contributions to volatility. As a robustness check, we investigate the impact of endogenous structural breaks on the interactional relationship between price volatility and futures trading...|$|R
