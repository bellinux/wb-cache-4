40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of the rerouting times in UNINETT, the Norwegian research network. Rerouting happens in case of a topology change of the network, and the routers have to calculate new paths to all destinations. The downtimes due to rerouting is a major contributor to the overall service unavailability. Because of this it is of interest to study the different components of these downtimes, and propose changes to speed up the rerouting process. The main goal for the thesis is to improve the service availablility in UNINETT. In UNINETT there are measurements of periods of packet loss available. These measurements, as well as the statistics from the network nodes, are analysed and the results are presented in this thesis. UNINETT is a network with IS-IS as the routing protocol, and fault handling by path restoration. Fault handling by path restoration means there is no spare capacity to switch to in case of a link or node failure. All routers in the network have to be updated about the topology change, and find new paths around the failure. The delay to update the network nodes to a common stable view, is called the convergence time. During this period it is observed packet loss, and it is of interest to make this period as short as possible. The reason for the packet loss during the convergence time is the inconsistency in the router's routing and forwarding tables. The construction of transient loops between nodes can happen in this phase. This will impose extra load to the network, delay, and in worst case loss of packets. These loops are called micro loops and increase the downtime during the convergence period. The parametrization in IS-IS is studied, and changes to the parameter values are proposed. Too much tuning of the parameters may introduce instability in the network, which increase the load to the nodes and links. This can lead to even longer convergence time, and periods with packet loss. The recommended values are tested in a small test lab replicating parts of the topology of Northern Norway in UNINETT. The results from the test are compared with a case study of a failure on the Trondheim-Troms?? link in UNINETT. The observations from the case study show a typical delay of up to 10 s for the convergence time. The results from the test lab show {{that it is possible to}} achieve sub-second convergence time, without any compromise on the stability of the network. Due to the small scale of the test lab, the traffic intensity was too low to observe any overload to the nodes or links. This may be a problem in a full scale network like UNINETT, and further testing is recommended before the proposed changes to the parameters are implemented in any production network. The fault handling in UNINETT is also studied, which includes the contribution from the different components to the convergence time. The observations and results from the mentioned case study and test lab are used in this study too. It is observed that the <b>timer</b> <b>delay</b> before the "Shortest Path Tree" computation is run in the routers, is the major contributor to the convergence time. This is improved by tuning the SPT timers, as observed in the results from the test lab. The failure detection and flooding components are also large contributors to the convergence time. The test lab shows that the failure detection is improved by tuning the hello parameters in IS-IS, but a less processor intensive method called BFD is recommended for further study. The parameters triggering the data-link layer timers may also be a possibility to speed up the failure detection, but this is not further investigated in the thesis. The flooding component is reduced by enabling the fast flooding command. The phenomena of micro loops is studied, and the method called oFIB is recommended for implementation in UNINETT. Micro loops are a small contributor to the convergence time in UNINETT today, but the customers' requirements for service availability are increasing, and the necessity of a solution is in near future. In addition to the oFIB method, a fast repair technique like IPFRR may eliminate almost all downtimes during rerouting in UNINETT, but this is subjects for further studies. </p...|$|E

The early units were timers in a sheet metal box with an analog potentiometer and lock nut to establish a setpoint with no readout or feedback to the driver.

Such drag racing <b>delay</b> <b>timers</b> are very crude by today's standards. Nolen (IKE) Hamma is credited with introducing such early devices to drag racing.

40|$|Femtocell {{technology}} has been proposed to offload user data traffic from the macrocell to the femtocell and extend the limited coverage of the macrocell in Mobile Communications Networks (MCNs). In existing commercial femtocell/macrocell networks, a widely accepted solution to configure the Location Areas (LAs) is to partition the femtocells overlapped with a macrocell into small groups and to assign each group with a unique LA ID {{different from that of}} the macrocell. Such configuration can reduce the paging cost in the mobility management, but increases registration signaling overhead due to discontinuous coverage of femtocells. To reduce signaling overhead in the femtocell/macrocell network, we propose a Delay Registration (DR) algorithm that postpones the registration until the <b>delay</b> <b>timer</b> expires when the MS moves into the overlapped femtocell. Analytical models and simulation experiments are proposed to investigate the performance of the DR algorithm. Our analytical models are general enough to accommodate various MS mobility behaviors. Our study can provide guidelines for the operators to set up a <b>delay</b> <b>timer</b> to reduce signaling overhead while sustaining the traffic offloading capability of the femtocell...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Message {{dissemination}} protocols are a {{key component}} of the communication infrastructure of the Intelligent Transportation System. They have been targeted by several research and standardization efforts. An especially interesting class of dissemination protocols are so called <b>timer</b> (or <b>delay)</b> based ones. The recently standardized GeoBroadcast service of the GeoNetworking protocol of falls into this category. This work lays out an analytical model of message coverage distance and delivery delay with timer-based dissemination protocols in a highway environment. The model {{is based on the assumption}} of (possibly non homogeneous) Poisson vehicle spatial distribution. The model results are compared with computer simulations and measured data driven experiments, including scenarios with traffic discontinuities (signalized intersections). The limits of applicability of the proposed model are assessed, showing that it provides accurate predictions with a wide range of system parameters for highway scenarios. It is also shown that one of the most popular timer-based dissemination protocols achieves the same connectivity and coverage performance of the ideal message flooding...|$|R
40|$|Real-time systems, {{characterized}} {{by a set of}} timings con-stants (internal <b>delays,</b> <b>timers,</b> clock speeds), need to be perfectly reliable. Formal methods can prove their correct-ness but, if one of the timing constants changes, verifica-tion needs to be restarted from scratch. Also, variations of some delays (even infinitesimal) may lead to the specifica-tion violation. It is thus interesting to reason parametrically, and synthesize constraints on the timing constants seen as parameters to formally guarantee the specification. We pro-pose here an attempt to distribute a synthesis algorithm, the behavioral cartography, and we evaluate two work distribu-tion algorithms. The parallelization gives promising results and opens perspectives toward verification of larger models...|$|R

First, we gave an outline of the configuration and operation principle of the sorting machine. Second, the input and output (I/O) signals that should be controlled were classified. Last but not least, the control strategy was presented both from the hardware side and the software side. In terms of the hardware design, touch screen was adopted as the human interface device (HID) for the sake of convenience, and isolated power module as well as optical isolated module were applied to improve the anti- electro magnetic interference (EMI) performance; In terms of software design, mechanisms such as multi-task by-turn and <b>timer</b> interrupt <b>delay</b> were adopted to improve the operation efficiency...|$|R
