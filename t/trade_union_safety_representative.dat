40|$|Market {{research}} {{was carried out}} to determine industry's perception of occupational exposure limits (OELs) {{and the extent to}} which they influence the selection of measures to control exposure. Telephone interviews were carried out with 1000 randomly selected users of chemicals, 400 from establishments with some use of chemicals and 600 from establishments with chemicals in daily use. 150 interviews were also carried out with <b>Trade</b> <b>Union</b> Health and <b>Safety</b> <b>Representatives.</b> The interviews covered basic information on chemicals used, sources of information, risk reduction measures used and understanding of COSHH and OELs. Most respondents came from firms with 10 employees or less (75 %, all user group; 57 %, heavy user group), closely reflecting the profile of British industry. In contrast, most (77 %) <b>Trade</b> <b>Union</b> Health and <b>Safety</b> <b>Representatives</b> came from firms with at least 100 employees. Respondents in the all user group were drawn from across the whole range of industrial activity, whereas the heavy users were concentrated in manufacturing.

40|$|Health and {{well-being}} (H&WB) initiatives have increasingly appeared in workplaces, {{but are the}} subject of surprisingly little critical analysis. The terms H&WB have also become positively embedded in Human Resource Management (HRM) and academic vocabularies, often displacing disability, which, it is argued, is (wrongly) regarded as a negative descriptor. This article challenges the sometimes taken-for-granted assumption that employer-led H&WB initiatives are inherently positive. It considers how they are being used to undermine statutory <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> health and <b>safety</b> <b>representatives,</b> reinforce concepts of normalcy and ableism in respect of worker lifestyle and impairments, and individualize/medicalize experiences of workplace stress. Utilizing a critical disability studies lens debate challenges a dominant element of many H&WB programmes – employee resilience – and concludes that a social model of disability and workplace well-being is needed to focus debate on the social, economic and political causes of ill-health and dis-ability in workplaces under neo-liberal austerity...|$|R

As early as after a few years work with machines that vibrate can cause young sensitive persons to develop vibration injuries. An evaluation has been done on a web page with focus on information about work related vibration injuries. As a part of the evaluation a user observation and interview study was performed with workers who worked in different occupations. The workers all used machine that vibrate as part of the work. A total of eleven workers participated in the study. Eleven workers were employed in the public sector and two workers were employed in the Industry. The participants were seven women, six of which worked as household technicians and one as attendant. Four men were also participants in the study, of which one was a forklift driver, two electricians and one technician. The participant’s activities on the web page and the interview afterwards were video recorded.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{effectiveness}} of worker representation and consultation on occupational health and safety in the UK in a context in which, following the 1977 <b>Safety</b> <b>Representatives</b> and <b>Safety</b> Committees (SRSC) Regulations 1977, recognised <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> have the right to appoint health and <b>safety</b> <b>representatives</b> who have rights to representation and consultation and to access the training and facilities needed to support these activities. Design/methodology/approach – The chemical industry is the chosen site for this enquiry, because, it offers some of the most propitious conditions in which to examine the operation of what has been the preferred model in UK health and safety regulation, namely those in which there are recognised <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> and where there are likely to be systems and structures of industrial relations in place combined with arrangements for OHS management. Five establishments are examined. Findings – The research suggests joint arrangements make for better safety outcomes and that there is a relation between management consultation on general issues and those of health and safety. Overall, though, management capacity and commitment pose considerable constraints to employee representation on health and safety. The SRSC regulations apply in all five cases but worker representation operated below the level to be expected from the regulations. Practical implications – A stronger legislative steer on worker consultation and representation in respect of workplace health and safety is required. Originality/value – Demonstrates that, even in an apparently propitious environment, legal requirements are not being implemented, and that management commitment and support are vital...|$|R
