50|$|The factory {{was closed}} in 1991. Amerika {{was part of}} Arnsdorf until 1993 and, {{together}} with the latter, became part of Penig in 1994. In 1995, the town of Penig bought the buildings from the <b>Treuhandanstalt,</b> and new trades and a museum (including workshops of locksmiths and file cutters, powered by a refurbished water turbine) have been established since.|$|E
50|$|After {{political}} changes of 1989 {{it became clear}} that the cost of sulphur extraction was clearly to high in comparison with international levels. The pit now belonged to the <b>Treuhandanstalt.</b> On 1 May 1990, the operating agreement of the Harzbergbau GmbH Elbingerode was founded. The firm was however was directed by the <b>Treuhandanstalt.</b> Missing payments led to difficulties in the payment of wages, so that a loan had to be taken out. Initially, it was planned to cease production in 1991. The actual closure took place, however, as early as 31 July 1990. Symbolically, the last mine cart was hauled on 4 December 1990, the anniversary of Saint Barbara, the miners' patron saint. The exit of the specially decorated cart was paid little attention by the 116 employees at that time. The mine had produced a total of about 13 million tonnes of ore.|$|E

The hotel was eventually sold, along with a number of other former Deutsche Interhotels properties, and renamed The Westin Grand Berlin on July 1, 1997.|$|E
50|$|On August 15, 1990 - {{after the}} {{collapse}} of the GDR, and the reunification of Germany, the firm — under <b>Treuhandanstalt,</b> a government agency established to administer the selling of assets, including entire companies, that had been owned by the DDR — registered as Maxim-Gorki-Druck GmbH.

50|$|After the {{political}} {{changes in the}} GDR in 1989, Buna Werke were initially administrated by <b>Treuhandanstalt</b> (later Bundesanstalt für vereinigungsbedingte Sonderaufgaben (BVS), a privatisation agency. In 1992, the works employed only 7200 people. In 1995 Dow Chemical took over {{large parts of the}} facilities, but only few employees. The outdated production facilities were demolished and the land rehabilitated for use. Rehabilitation expenses of BVS were estimated to be 809 million Deutsche Mark in 1999 alone.|$|E
50|$|The DDR's PeacefulRevolution {{took place}} in September and October 1989. This was {{followed}} by contact between IWL and Mercedes-Benz in February 1990 that launched a joint project designated IFA 1318. A prototype IFA 1318 truck, with a Mercedes-Benz LN2 cab on an L 60 chassis, was completed on 3 May 1990. The IFA-Kombinat Nutzkraftwagen ("IFA Goods Vehicle Combine") was broken up and in June 1990 a separate IFA-Automobilwerk Ludwigsfelde GmbH was founded under the <b>Treuhandanstalt.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Treuhandanstalt</b> (the {{government}} {{responsible for}} privatising concerns {{owned by the}} East German government) sold Kranbau Eberswalde GmbH in 1994 to Vulkan Kocks GmbH. The company then {{became a member of}} Bremen-based Vulkan AG and was renamed Vulkan Kranbau Eberswalde GmbH. In 1996 the workforce numbered just 239 people. In 1996 Vulkan AG went into receivership and Vulkan Kocks GmbH was taken over by Kirow Leipzig AG in 1997. The company was then called Kirow Leipzig KE Kranbau Eberswalde GmbH.|$|E
50|$|The Saxe-Coburg and Gotha family kept {{possession}} {{until the}} end of World War II, when, after some time {{in the hands of the}} state, the house and estate were used for a short time by Soviet Red Army forces as a military hospital and then for various functions by the government of the East Germany, who opened it as a showpiece hotel in 1961. After 1991 the castle with its facilities and park passed from the <b>Treuhandanstalt</b> into private ownership, only to be closed in 2001. Its future seems still to be uncertain.|$|E
50|$|From 1993 to 1997 Murphy {{headed the}} firm's Frankfurt office. He later {{stated that the}} {{business}} conduction there {{had been in a}} poor state but that he had made remedy to that. Based upon that he was handed oversight responsibility for activities in Germany, Switzerland and Austria, {{as well as in the}} emerging nations of post-USSR Central Europe. In this role he engaged in a number of transactions with the German government's <b>Treuhandanstalt</b> agency, whose purpose was conducting the privatization of formerly state-owned enterprises within the boundaries of no-longer-extant East Germany. Murphy was also active in the Atlantik-Brücke organization, including co-founding its International Advisor Council.|$|E
50|$|After German reunification in 1990 Pentacon, as {{with most}} East German companies, came to be possessed by the <b>Treuhandanstalt</b> (the federal board {{concerned}} with the privatisation of East German companies) and was selected for closure instead of sale. It was deemed that company was grossly inefficient, employing six thousand staff when it could have sufficed with one thousand, and selling its cameras at a loss. Liquidation began on October 2, 1990 (one day before official reunification), and production ceased on June 30, 1991. By then it had shed nearly three thousand employees to retain a total of 3331 - the next day all but 232 were laid off.|$|E
50|$|Wolf Klinz was a Partner with McKinsey & Company in the United Kingdom, Germany and France. Subsequently {{he served}} as a Member of the Executive Board of a Swiss Corporation. After German reunification he joined for the Executive Board of <b>Treuhandanstalt,</b> the German Government's agency for {{privatisation}} of the former East German industry. He finished his business career as CEO of a large German corporation in 2003 when he decided to go into European politics. From 2000 to 2004, he held the (honorary) position of President of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) Frankfurt am Main. From 2003 to 2004 he was the Vice-President of Eurochambres in Brussels.|$|E
5000|$|In 1983 Agthe left CCC (which {{had been}} renamed to Continental Group) {{and moved to}} the U.S. {{subsidiary}} of Brown, Boveri & Cie. to become its Chief Executive Officer, a post he retained after Brown Boveri’s merger with ASEA, from which Asea Brown Boveri emerged. [...] After ABB merged with Combustion Engineering Agthe considered retirement, but, subsequent to German reunification, he was asked to represent ABB in its transactions with the <b>Treuhandanstalt,</b> the trust which had been set up by the German government to facilitate the reprivatization of the numerous enterprises formerly owned by East Germany. Agthe moved to Berlin and spent the next two years acquiring several former state owned companies.|$|E
50|$|Even before {{economic}} unification, the West German {{government had}} decided {{that one of its}} first tasks was to privatize the East German economy. For this reason, it had taken over in June the <b>Treuhandanstalt</b> (Trust Agency, commonly known as Treuhand), which had been established by the GDR to take over East German firms and to turn them over to new management through privatization. The agency assumed the assets and liabilities of about 8,000 East German enterprises in order to sell them to German and other bidders. By the time the Treuhand was disbanded at the end of 1994, it had privatized some 14,000 enterprises. The policies of the Treuhand were not universally welcomed, and the CEO Detlev Karsten Rohwedder was assassinated in Düsseldorf in 1991.|$|E
50|$|At German reunification in 1990 EKO {{became a}} {{corporation}} (EKO Stahl GmbH) - subsequent loss {{of business in}} East Germant and eastern Europe caused serious economic problems for the company, as did the high employment rates, and relatively low value product range. During {{the transition to a}} free market model employment was reduced from over 12,000 to under 3,000. In 1994/5 Cockerill-Sambre acquired a 60% stake in the company, with the state (via the <b>treuhandanstalt)</b> retaining 40%. As part of the acquisition improvements to the plant were scheduled for completion 1998 including a new blast furnace, a hot rolling mill, and an upgrade to the cold rolling mill. 900 million Deutschmarks in state aid for the reconstruction was approved by the European Union. By 1997 the modernisation work and construction of blast furnace and hot rolling plant had been completed. In 1998 Cockerill-Sambre acquired the remaining 40% of the company for 40 million Deutschmarks. Cockerill-Sambre became part of Usinor in 1998.|$|E
50|$|Riva Acciaio {{was founded}} in 1954 in Milan by Adriano and Emilio Riva as an iron scrap trading business. In 1957 the first Riva Acciaio {{mini-mill}} was built in Caronno Pertusella near Varese. A few years later, this plant became the first steelworks in Italy to use continuous casting, in partnership with steel plant engineer Danieli. In the 1960s and 1970s Riva expanded {{by means of the}} acquisition of several small steel producers in Northern Italy and Spain (Siderurgica Sevillana). Starting from the 80s, Riva took part in the privatization process of the ailing European steel industry by making further acquisitions in the main European countries such as Italy (the previously state-owned steelworks Acciaierie di Cornigliano in Genoa), Belgium (Charleroi-Marcinelle plant) and France (Alpa plant in Gargenville). In 1992 it acquired directly from the German <b>Treuhandanstalt</b> two important plants (Brandenburger Elektrostahlwerke and Henningsdorfer Elektrostahlwerke) in the former German Democratic Republic. In 1995 Riva Acciaio purchased ILVA from the Italian government, becoming one of the main European steel producers.|$|E
50|$|Gehrmann studied {{economics}} {{and social sciences}} from 1960 till 1966 at the Universities of Saarbruecken, Vienna and Muenster. After completing his PhD in 1969 at the University of Munster, Gehrmann began {{his work as a}} scientific fellow at the Universities of Muenster and Augsburg and was there until 1973. He then {{began his career as a}} visiting researcher at United Nations in Geneva (Economic Commission for Europe) for the subject “ Measurement of regional disparities in urban and regional policy, documented by economic, social and environmental indicators” from 1974 till 1976. From 1976 till 1980, Gehrmann was a full-time desk-officer manager, both in Federal Statistical Office and in State Government of Hesse. In 1980, he was offered and accepted a chair at the Federal University of Applied Administrative Sciences (Bruehl/ Bonn). During this time, he undertook several time-limited delegations to Federal Ministries in Bonn for highly specialised issues in economic, social and environmental fields. After Germany’s reunification, Gehrmann accepted a chair at the Bauhaus University in Weimar from 1990 till 1996. At the same time, he was a consultant to Germany’s “Privatisation Agency” (<b>Treuhandanstalt).</b> From 1996 to 1998, he worked on a 2-years-stay in a task-force in the Federal Ministries of “Interior” and “Labour” for a special function in long-term economic affairs.|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of privatization in the Eastern Germany {{can be better}} {{understood in terms of}} the 'economic polities' applied to the 'political markets'. The <b>Treuhandanstalt</b> {{played a key role in}} transforming the entire economy of the former GDR into the market economy in the wake of unification of East Germany with West Germany. The present study discusses the agency's structure, functions and responsibilities, on the one hand and financing, functioning and evaluation, on the other. Although the <b>Treuhandanstalt</b> provides a unique example of privatization by the state and the market, it cannot be duplicated or copied in toto. ...|$|E
40|$|Since 1994 the <b>Treuhandanstalt</b> has {{publicly}} put out for tender employment projects {{in accordance with}} § 249 h of the Employment Promotion Act and has allocated them on a competitive basis. As the allocation of these projects to private companies has always been called for but only rarely put into practice, the <b>Treuhandanstalt</b> therefore acts as a forerunner. The effects of this allocation process are {{the main focus of}} this article. With reference to the current discussion of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} active labour market policy, the requirements which have to be fulfilled for publicly supported employment and which provide the basis for the evaluation of the Treuhandanstalt's process of invitation to tender are named. The effects on the following requirements are discussed individually: efficiency and refunding, interlinking of labour market policy and regional structural policy and creation of transitions into the primary labour market, both on an individual and a project level. This analysis includes previously unpublished details from the <b>Treuhandanstalt</b> on their tendering process as well as results of interviews with experts. The results can be summarised as follows: - The inclusion of competition has a clearly positive effect on efficiency and the refunding rate of the projects. Decisive for this are economies and the reduction of displacement and substitution effects. - The process reinforces the interlinking of labour market policy and regional structural policy in the first place through procedural integration of central parties. - On the individual level, transitions into regular employment could be promoted amongst other things through the effects of acquaintance and reputation. From the data available, however, this effect does not seem to differ greatly from projects which were not put out to tender. - On the project level, possibilities of transition into the primary labour market, for example through setting up small businesses, are judged with scepticism. Although the tendering process does in principle create favourable conditions, the possibilities of setting up small businesses appear to be limited, as the market potential in restoration, demolition and dismantling work is largely exhausted. The concluding chapter is devoted to the question of the applicability of the Treuhand model for a larger sphere of labour promotion projects. § 249 designates an employment subsidy for work in the fields of environment, social services and youth assistance.
