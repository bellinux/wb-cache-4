Filmmaker Rajkumar Gupta commented, [...] "It would be challenging to take forward a story that has not worked earlier." [...] Producer Ramesh Taurani responded negatively to the idea, saying, [...] "It is important for the film to be appreciated so that a sequel can be made." [...] Trade analyst Atul Mohan called the sequel [...] "a bad idea." [...] Conversely, others were supportive of the sequel. Producer Goldie Behl brushed aside arguments about the success of the first film, saying, [...] "If the people <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> earn some more, then it doesn't matter how big or small the hit was." [...] Director Kunal Kohli also reacted positively, saying, [...] "Certain ideas naturally lend themselves to sequels.

2500|$|The {{wording of}} the {{proposed}} advert caused considerable debate among atheists and Christians alike and Sherine discussed it in a post-launch article, [...] "Probably the best atheist bus campaign ever", on the Guardian's [...] "Comment Is Free" [...] section. Dawkins stated that he preferred the wording [...] "There is almost certainly no God". Ariane Sherine claims {{it is necessary to}} be factually accurate, and that as it is impossible to disprove the existence of God it is only possible to say one 'probably' does not exist. Critic D. J. Taylor felt that this qualification let the campaign down, but admired it for introducing some tentativeness into an often polarised debate, while atheists including A. C. Grayling <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be certain there is no God and therefore the word 'probably' should not be used. It was also suggested that inserting the word would avoid a breach of the Advertising Standards Authority's rules.|$|E

Allentown resident Ty Hildenbrandt, one of the show's hosts, pays homage to Yocco's during weekly preview shows by selecting (at least) one team each week as the [...] "Yocco's Home Dog of the Week".

This designation does not indicate any sponsorship of The Solid Verbal by Yocco's.

50|$|Two of {{the weaker}} dragons don't have keepers. Thymara, Tats, {{and a young}} girl named Sylve, try tending to the wounds on the weak silver dragon's tail. Sedric comes {{to help with the}} hopes of getting some {{valuable}} dragon items, keeping some pieces of festering flesh. He thinks back on how Hest slowly took over his life. He befriends Thymara so that she will translate for him when Alise speaks to the dragons, as he cannot understand them when they speak. Later on he sneaks out at night to take some scales from a copper dragon, near death, and gets some blood from it as well, which he tastes. When the keepers realize that the dragon will not last much longer, there is an argument as to what should be done with it, where Greft <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> use the dragon. Mercor arrives to tell them that dragons belong only to dragons and he will watch over the copper with Sylve until it dies. It is uncertain at this point if <b>they</b> realize <b>that</b> Sedric had stolen body parts from it. Sedric goes on to tell Alise <b>that</b> <b>they</b> must leave because he fears that the obvious attraction between her and Captain Leftrin will make her unfaithful.|$|R

Liu and some officers show up, forcing everyone to disperse except for Kurt, who is with his brother. At the coroners, Kurt confronts Marcia, blaming her for what had happened to Eric.
