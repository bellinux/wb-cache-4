40|$|Background: Following an {{epidemiological}} as-sessment {{to map out}} the endemicity of trachoma in Ghana, Trachoma control interventions {{were put}} in place in two districts in Upper West and three in Northern Regions in the year 2001. <b>The</b> <b>control</b> <b>activities</b> were based on the WHO recommended strategy of SAFE. After two years of intervention, a study was undertaken to determine the impact of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>activities.</b> Methods: A simple random selection of com-pounds was done. Trained and standardized oph-thalmic nurses examined children aged 1 to 10 years for dirty faces and signs of active trachoma. Community members were interviewed to ascer-tain availability of potable water and latrines. Results: A total of 9, 288 children aged 1 - 10 years were examined in 2003. Overall TF/TI prevalence for Upper West was 5. 6 % and for Northern Region was 3. 5 %. In 2000, 6, 241 children aged 1 - 10 years were examined. The overall prevalence of TF/TI for baseline was 15. 0 % for Upper West and 9. 1 % for Northern Region. The prevalence of TF/TI showed significant reduction (p-value < 0. 001) in all five districts and overall in the two regions. Conclusion: Trachoma control activities over a two-year period in two regions in Ghana had led to significant reduction in the prevalence of active disease.
