40|$|We have {{identified}} three fundamental monitoring dimensions {{for the maintenance}} and evolution of Maritime Safety and Security Systems, which are representing a class of systems that are required to be continuously online. The monitoring dimensions consist of: 'services', 'users' and 'time'. As <b>traces</b> crosscut these dimensions, {{we are interested in}} learning how to extract <b>traces</b> of dynamic and distributed systems. Through a literature study we identified three fundamental online <b>tracing</b> techniques, from which all <b>tracing</b> approaches can be derived: Tagged <b>Tracing,</b> Recognized <b>Tracing</b> and Timestamped <b>Tracing.</b> We devised an evaluation setup on which we evaluated <b>tracing</b> techniques for dynamic and distributed systems. With 28 percent overhead Timestamped <b>Tracing</b> has the lowest overhead, but it only functions on systems using synchronous communication. Tagged <b>Tracing</b> on the other hand, operated correctly on systems employing both asynchronous and synchronous communication with an overhead of 43 percent. We did not evaluate the accuracy of Recognized <b>Tracing</b> as the accuracy is dependent on the implementation of the dynamic system. Recognized <b>Tracing</b> presented an overhead of 36 percent.
