5|$|In 1829, Crittenden {{was elected}} to the Kentucky House via a special election. He served as Speaker of the House for his entire term. In 1830, he was the Whig nominee to replace John Rowan in the Senate. Secretly, the party wished to {{nominate}} Henry Clay, giving him a springboard from which to launch another presidential campaign, but it was unknown whether {{he would be able to}} secure enough votes for confirmation; it was decided that Crittenden would be the nominee, and if the voting favored the Whigs by a large enough margin, Crittenden would withdraw and allow them to confirm Clay instead. The Democrats countered successively with Richard Mentor Johnson, John Rowan, Charles A. Wickliffe, and John Breathitt. None of them polled more than sixty-four of the sixty-nine votes needed for confirmation. Crittenden garnered sixty-eight votes on fourteen different ballots, but he refused to vote for himself because he wanted Clay <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee.</b> Some of Crittenden's supporters, however, refused to vote for Clay, and the seat was left vacant.|$|E
500|$|McKinley {{expected}} {{the election to}} be fought {{on the issue of}} tariffs; he was a well-known protectionist. The Democrats met in convention in July in Chicago; former Missouri congressman Richard P. Bland was deemed likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee.</b> [...] As McKinley awaited his opponent, he privately commented on the nationwide debate over silver, stating to his Canton crony, Judge Day, that [...] "This money matter is unduly prominent. [...] In thirty days you won't hear anything about it." [...] The future Secretary of State and Supreme Court justice responded: [...] "In my opinion in thirty days you won't hear of anything else." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison and his adherents were unimpressed by McKinley's conduct, {{recalling that}} he had cut off talk of a {{candidacy}} in 1888, but had not done so in 1892. Nevertheless, Hanna {{wrote in a letter}} that [...] "I do not consider that Governor McKinley was placed in any false position by what was done ... Governor McKinley's position today as a result of all that transpired at Minneapolis is in the best possible shape for his future. [...] His bearing and conduct and personal magnetism won the hearts and respect of everybody." [...] McKinley campaigned loyally for President Harrison, who was defeated by former president Cleveland in the November election, and according to the governor's secretary, Charles Bawsel, [...] " [...] is bound <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee</b> for the presidency, and the very fact of the defeat this year will elect him the next time." ...|$|E
50|$|Brad Schneider, <b>the</b> incumbent, <b>was</b> {{selected}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Democratic <b>nominee,</b> and Robert Dold {{was once}} again selected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Republican <b>Nominee.</b> Dold won <b>the</b> election with just over 50% of the vote.|$|R

500|$|Both Hanna and Foraker {{had been}} spoken of as {{possible}} Republican presidential candidates in 1904; with President Roosevelt now likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee,</b> both men's presidential ambitions were pushed back four years. [...] Hanna {{in particular was}} reluctant to publicly put aside his presidential candidacy, believing that keeping it alive would help assure his re-election by the legislature in 1904. [...] In 1903, Foraker saw an opportunity to embarrass Hanna and boost his own chances for 1908 by getting the Republican state convention to pass a resolution endorsing Roosevelt for re-election. [...] If Hanna supported the resolution, {{he made it clear}} he would not be a candidate; if he opposed it, he risked Roosevelt's wrath. [...] Hanna sent Roosevelt a telegram that he would oppose the resolution; Roosevelt replied that he expected his administration's supporters to vote for such a resolution, and Hanna gave in.|$|E
500|$|When McKinley {{heard that}} Bryan was likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee,</b> {{he called the}} report [...] "rot" [...] and hung up the phone. The Republican nominee was slow to realize the surge of support for Bryan after the nomination, stating his view that the silver {{sentiment}} would be gone in a month. When McKinley and his advisers, such as industrialist and future senator Mark Hanna, realized that the views were more than transitory, they began intensive fundraising from corporations and the wealthy. The money went for speakers, pamphlets, and other means of conveying their [...] "sound money" [...] campaign to the voter. With far less money than McKinley, Bryan embarked on a nationwide campaign tour by train on a then-unprecedented scale. [...] McKinley on the other hand, opted for a front porch campaign. Both men spoke {{to hundreds of thousands}} of people from their chosen venues.|$|E
2500|$|Pitted against Francis Shunk Brown, the {{candidate}} of Vare's Philadelphia machine, and Thomas Phillips, a former two-term congressman from western Pennsylvania, who was enthusiastically supported by the state's [...] "wet" [...] forces, Pinchot overcame a deficit of nearly 200,000 votes in traditionally Republican Philadelphia to pull into a 12,000-vote lead on election night. The 281,000 votes cast for former congressman Phillips, most of which came at Brown's expense, appeared to have given Pinchot a narrow victory in the primary. Brown's attorneys immediately challenged the results, contending that some 60,000 ballots in Luzerne County should be tossed out {{because they had been}} perforated beforehand by county election officials in an attempt to prevent fraud. The legal battle ensued throughout the summer and nobody knew for sure who the Republican candidate for governor would be, especially since both men periodically claimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee.</b> Ending four months of litigation and political turmoil on August 20, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, while castigating the Luzerne Common Pleas Court for marking (perforating) the ballots in the first place, upheld an earlier lower court ruling and declared that all 60,000 perforated ballots were valid, thereby certifying Pinchot as the winner of the May 20 Republican primary.|$|E

50|$|On Bush's {{shortlist}} was Secretary Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, Former Senator John Danforth of Missouri, eventual 2008 {{presidential nominee}} and Senator John McCain of Arizona, Governor George Pataki of New York, and Dick Cheney. After {{more than three}} months of extensive research, Cheney recommended John Danforth <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee,</b> as the other choices' strengths were offset by liberal stances. Bush heavily considered Danforth, but ultimately asked Cheney himself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee.</b> By picking Cheney, Bush had a running mate who had years of experience as well as an extensive foreign policy expertise.|$|E
50|$|Hillary Clinton (D-NY) was {{the first}} and only First Lady to run and win for a United States Senate seat. She is also the only female senator <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee</b> of a major party for President of the United States.|$|E
25|$|On November 7, 2007, Robertson {{announced}} that he was endorsing Rudy Giuliani <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Republican <b>nominee</b> in <b>the</b> 2008 Presidential election.

5000|$|The LPN may {{nominate}} {{a candidate}} for any office that falls completely within one affiliate, unless the appropriate affiliate convention has either selected a candidate or voted NOTA for that office for that election.

50|$|In {{the context}} of {{elections}} for public office in a representational partisan democracy, a candidate who has been selected by a political party is normally said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee</b> of that party. The party's selection (that is, the nomination) is typically accomplished either based on one or more primary elections {{according to the rules}} of the party and any applicable election laws.|$|E
25|$|After 1968, {{the only}} way to win the party's presidential {{nomination}} became through the primary process; Humphrey turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last <b>nominee</b> of either major party to win his party's nomination without having directly competed in the primaries.|$|R
50|$|Babka {{initially}} {{tried to}} get involved in some 1996 campaigns, and he did ultimately volunteer in one.

5000|$|Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell was {{considered}} a moderate, {{often referred to as}} a [...] "swing vote" [...] in close decisions. After he announced his retirement on June 26, 1987, Senate Democrats had asked liberal leaders to form a [...] "solid phalanx" [...] to oppose an [...] "ideological extremist" [...] replacement to Powell; Democrats warned Reagan there would be a fight over the nomination if Bork were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee.</b>|$|E
50|$|Lorton {{ran in the}} Republican primary of 1924 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee</b> for U. S. Senator from Oklahoma, but William B. Pine {{defeated}} him soundly. In 1928, Lorton publicly {{supported the}} Democratic nominee for President, Alfred E. Smith. He transferred his political loyalty to the Democratic Party in 1932, but {{this turned out to}} be only temporary. He returned to the Republican Party in 1940, and remained a member for the rest of his life.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1924 Texas Democratic Primary, Charles V. Terrell was {{nominated}} for a non-consecutive term as Texas State Treasurer. After the Primary, M.W.M. Splawn, the nominee for the Texas Railroad Commission was appointed President of the University of Texas and the Texas Democratic Central Committee appointed Terrell as the nominee for the Railroad Commission and turned to Hatcher <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee</b> for State Treasurer.

50|$|Governor Hugh Smith Thompson {{had made}} no enemies during his first term as {{governor}} and no opposition to his nomination developed at the state Democratic convention of 1884. Thompson was then renominated by acclamation <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Democratic <b>nominee</b> for governor in the general election, effectively meaning that he would serve two more years {{since there was no}} opposition in the general election.|$|R
50|$|An unwed woman {{belonging}} to the Christian faith (who {{did not want to}} be identified) gave birth to a son in the year 2010.

Two days later, as the twenty-second ballot was being taken, it appeared that Hendricks {{was in the process of}} winning the nomination until the leader of the Ohio delegation suddenly switched his delegation's votes to Seymour. Though Seymour reiterated his unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>nominee,</b> the delegations revised their votes and gave the nomination to him unanimously.|$|E
50|$|Hughes was one {{of three}} final {{candidates}} considered by Vice President and Presidential <b>nominee</b> Hubert Humphrey <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Party's <b>nominee</b> for Vice President of the United States in 1968.|$|R
