50|$|A <b>train</b> <b>describer</b> is {{originally}} {{an additional}} apparatus at British railways that {{ensures that the}} identity of each train is displayed on the signalbox panel together with the indication of that train's presence, usually offering routing information. This routing information would then be passed through to the platform display for passenger information. Technically the train reporting number was pushed from one signal box to the next. A series of interconnected signal boxes form a <b>train</b> <b>describer</b> system (TDS) transferring <b>train</b> <b>describer</b> data to be shown on the respective signalbox panel in a <b>train</b> <b>describer</b> display. The electric relay interlocking boxes were later replaced by electronic control boards where the train indication is just a text element on the video display.|$|E

50|$|They were {{delivered}} in an unlined medium shade of Brunswick green with white cab roofs and yellow speed whiskers. The whiskers were replaced {{during the early}} 1960s by split yellow warning panels, one {{either side of the}} central character <b>train</b> <b>describer</b> which remained green.|$|E
50|$|The signaller's main duty is {{to ensure}} trains get from A to B safely and on time. The classic Train Register Book remains in use at most older installations, with <b>train</b> <b>describers</b> and Automatic <b>Train</b> Recording taking its place in more modern power {{signalling}} schemes. All trains are listed in a computer system in the UK in time order. This system is known as TRUST. Any train {{can be found on}} here together with its schedule and route. If a train is late {{it is up to the}} signaller to ascertain in what order the trains should run, known as regulating trains.|$|R
25|$|An {{extension}} at {{the southern}} end of the line to Camberwell and Denmark Hill was proposed and approved in 1931 as part of the London Electric Metropolitan District and Central London Railway Companies (Works) Act, 1931. In April 1937, the estimated cost of the proposed extension was £5,000,000 (approximately £ today) and the London Passenger Transport Board announced that, due to rising materials prices, the extension had been postponed until the Board's finances improved. Apart from the extension of the sidings south of Elephant & Castle, no work on the extension took place before the Second World War, but the powers were renewed by the government in 1947 under the Special Enactments (Extension of Time) Act, 1940. A projected extension as far as Camberwell was shown on a 1949 edition of the Underground map but no further work was done. The <b>train</b> <b>describers</b> at Warwick Avenue station showed Camberwell as a destination until the 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|Rail systems {{typically}} have an interface with a passenger information system (PIS) server, at each station linked to <b>train</b> <b>describers</b> which state {{the location of}} rolling stock on the network from sensors on trackside signaling equipment. The PIS invokes a stored message to be played from a local or remote digital voice announcement system, or a series of message fragments to be assembled in the correct order, for example: [...] " [...] / the / 23.30 / First_Great_Western / Night_Riviera_sleeper_service / from / London_Paddington / to / Penzance / .... / will depart from platform / one / this train is formed of / 12_carriages /." [...] Messages are routed via an IP network and are played on local amplification equipment. Taken together, the PA, routing, DVA, passenger displays and PIS interface {{are referred to as}} the customer information system (CIS), a term which itself is often used interchangeably with the term passenger information system.|$|R
50|$|A {{platform}} display, destination display or <b>train</b> <b>describer</b> (British English) is supplementing {{the destination}} sign on arriving trains giving passengers an advance information. Historically they did only show the next destination {{and sometimes the}} type of train. In later usage they were replaced by passenger information display systems (PIDS) allowing for real-time passenger information.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s, STC also {{supplied}} signalbox <b>train</b> <b>describer</b> equipment to British Railways; for the 1949 installation of power signalling in the North and South boxes at Doncaster, STC also provided route setting panels {{for control of}} points and signals, using a novel [...] "sequential switch interlocking" [...] format based around telephone exchange switching technology.|$|E
50|$|Coal Yard {{signal box}} is located 986 {{yards to the}} north of North Junction on the West Coast Main Line, with two lines to Coal Yard, Down Fast and Down Slow and two lines from Coal Yard, Up Fast and Up Slow. Operation on this line is Track Circuit Block. This {{required}} a <b>train</b> <b>describer</b> in North Junction and Coal Yard into which the headcode of the train to be sent is entered. This is then received on the next box's describer. Coal Yard box remains open to this day.|$|E
40|$|Estimating {{stop time}} is a {{critical}} task for timetable planning, especially since actual dwell time shows a significant variability that could hinder service reliability. Therefore its importance has increased as railways seek to maximize infrastructure utilization while improving the quality standards, including reliability. A significant amount of scientific work focussing on the estimation of dwell time within different transit systems {{can be found in}} literature. However, it is mostly focused on aspects such as, for example, the time required for each passenger to board depending on the number of steps, while in very few reports the applicability of the models and their practical relevance are described. This study presents an approach for estimating the stop time distribution of train services and using them in simulation or timetable planning tools. Based on conventional parameters {{on the one hand and}} on track occupancy data collected by <b>train</b> <b>describers</b> on the other, the models include an algorithm to derive the stop time from the track occupancy data and a multi-parametric dwell time estimation. When past track occupancy data is available, the parameters are estimated: the calibrated model can be used as input to plan or simulate future scenarios considering, for example, new rolling stock or different service patterns. The results of model calibration and its use in a test network around Venice are described in the last part of the paper...|$|R
40|$|Pictures {{painted in}} Words: ADLAB Audio Description guidelines’, a manual for audio describers, trainee audio describers and anyone {{involved}} in the audio description industry, marks the culmination and final ‘deliverable’ of the ADLAB project, financed by the European Union {{as part of the}} EACEA Lifelong Learning programme, and coordinated by the University of Trieste. The purpose of audio description (AD) is to provide a method whereby the blind and partially sighted community can gain access to audiovisual products of various types, though principally television and other screened material. It consists in creating a verbal description of the salient items that appear on screen, thereby providing access to the visual information accompanying the oral component of audio-visual material. ‘Pictures painted in Words’ provides an innovative approach to the preparation and <b>training</b> of audio <b>describers</b> in that the guidelines are not prescriptive or regulatory but ‘strategic’ in that alternative solutions are proposed depending on the context and particular characteristics of the situation presented in the audio-visual text. It is hoped that the results of these three years of dedicated research that has culminated in the publishing of this volume will be of assistance to all those {{involved in the}} exciting of AD for many years to come...|$|R
5000|$|The RIS {{system was}} started in 2003 and by 2007 it was planned to have 30,000 trains {{equipped}} with the necessary <b>train</b> <b>describer</b> (electronic train number). In an accompanying program the older flap-display information displays were replaced by electronic dot-matrix signage. While large stations have platform displays with multiple rows the Deutsche Bahn network operator developed the DSA standard system for smaller stations with single row. In 2011 a federal funding was granted to equip 4500 additional stations with DSA signage (...) [...] That makes {{for the majority of}} the 6500 DSAs by 2015.|$|E
5000|$|... 1168 {{yards away}} on the Manchester Lines (Up and Down Manchester) was Sydney Bridge signal box. As on the WCML, Track Circuit Block was {{operated}} on these lines. The <b>train</b> <b>describer</b> for these lines {{can be seen to}} the right. On 5 June 1959, Sydney Bridge was closed and replaced by Sandbach Power Signal Box (PSB) (4 miles 869 yards away). Crewe North Junction was unaffected by this change with the only difference being where the train describers were connected to. Sandbach box closed in March 2006, when the Manchester line was resignalled and control handed over to the new Manchester South SCC.|$|E
50|$|Kolkata metro trains {{operate on}} typical Indian Railways {{automatic}} signalling technology. A Route Relay Interlocking System {{has been provided}} at Mahanayak Uttam Kumar and Noapara carshed and are in operation to facilitate the prompt withdrawal and injection of rakes as well as performing shunting operations inside the car shed, required for maintenance purposes. Train Protection & Warning System(TPWS) is provided on the entire stretch of the Metro Railway. This system is designed to prevent collision caused by human (operator) error. <b>Train</b> <b>Describer</b> System and Auto Train Charting have also been provided to help the operartion control centre to monitor and plan train movement on a real time basis.|$|E
50|$|Other NX style {{systems were}} {{implemented}} by other railroad signal providers. For example, Union Route (UR) was {{the brand name}} of their Entrance-Exit system supplied by Union Switch & Signal Co. (US&S), and introduced in 1951. NX type systems and their costly pre-solid state control logic only tended to be installed in the busier or more complicated terminal areas where it could increase capacity and reduce staffing requirements. In a move that was popular in Europe, the signalling for an entire area was condensed into a single large power signal box with a control panel in the operator's area and {{the equivalent of a}} telephone exchange in the floors below that combined the vital relay based interlocking logic and non-vital control logic in one place. Such advanced schemes would also include <b>train</b> <b>describer</b> and train tracking technologies. Away from complex terminals unit lever control systems remained popular until the 1980s when solid state interlocking and control systems began to replace the older relay plants of all types.|$|E
50|$|Prototypical {{working with}} full track circuiting and {{accurate}} signalling remains {{the key to}} the railway's operation. The two termini are controlled by semaphores while the whole of the main line is equipped with colour-lights, ten of these being automatic. The boxes at Hardwick Central and Everglades Junction are fitted with Westinghouse 'L' type frames with, respectively, twenty-three and thirty-one miniature levers. The former was once part of the 227-lever installation at Crewe South junction while the latter is the complete frame from South Croydon junction. The country terminus, Cockcrow Hill, has a 16-lever full-size 'knee' frame manufactured by the Railway Signal Company, probably around 1930. It came from the Waterloo terminus of the Waterloo & City line. Exactly as in full-size practice trains are offered and accepted between signal boxes by the use of Block instruments. Because of the complication of the area it controls, and there may be as many as six trains on the track diagram at once, Everglades Junction box is also equipped with a <b>train</b> <b>describer</b> to assist the signalmen, usually two on duty together, in keeping track of movements. The signalling system is all-electric, including the interlocking, semaphores being worked by solenoids sealed for outdoor use. All signals return to 'danger' when the train has passed into the next track-circuit section. Points have a mechanism powered by the very reliable Ford Escort windscreen wiper motor that moves the blades and then locks and detects them. No detection, no signal! The few sprung points are also detected to ensure closure after a train has passed through in the trailing direction.|$|E
40|$|Data {{records from}} <b>train</b> <b>describer</b> systems are a {{valuable}} {{source of information}} for analyzing railway operations performance and assessing railway timetable quality. This paper presents a tool based on process mining event data records from the Dutch <b>train</b> <b>describer</b> system TROTS. The underlying algorithms automatically identify route conflicts with conflicting trains, determine accurate arrival and departure times/delays at stations, and reconstruct the train paths on track section and blocking time level. Graphical user interface and visualizations of the time-distance diagrams and blocking time diagrams support and simplify the analysis of running times, dwell times, incidents, track obstructions, disruptions, and structural errors in the timetable design. The case study of a one day of traffic on a busy railway corridor in the Netherlands is presented, {{as well as the}} examples to describe the graphical user interface.

40|$|Prediction of train {{positions}} {{in time and}} space is required for traffic control and passenger information. However, in practice only the last measured train delays are known and dispatchers must predict the arrival times of trains without adequate computer support. This paper presents a real-time tool for continuous online prediction of train traffic using a timed event graph that captures all scheduled events and precedence relations between them, such as train runs and stops, connections, and minimum headways. Robust estimates for the minimum process times are derived online by computing small percentiles (conditional on current delay where relevant) for conflict-free running times that are obtained by pre-processing historical <b>train</b> <b>describer</b> data. The graph is updated regularly when new information becomes available on train positions or traffic control decisions. The realization times of all events in the graph are predicted considering the usage of running time supplements and buffer times, as well as time loss due to route conflicts based on a conflict detection scheme within the prediction algorithm. The model is demonstrated on the busy corridor The Hague – Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Transport & PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Process {{operators}} {{at large}} railway stations have the difficult task {{to secure a}} fluent train traffic flow while minimizing deviations from established timetables. Variation in actual train departure times is inevitable due to many circumstances such as arrival delays and fluctuations in alighting and boarding time, even if some buffer time is contained in the dwell time. Moreover, a departure may be delayed by waiting for a feeder train to secure a connection and by conflicting train movements prohibiting an outbound train path. The predictability of train processes is even more degraded when in similar situations different control actions are pursued depending on for instance individual dispatchers. In the Netherlands, passenger train services operate basically according to a cyclic timetable, repeating the same arrival and departure times each hour, {{with the exception of}} additional passenger trains in rush hours and freight trains that are scheduled in between the regular train services. It is hence anticipated that the traffic processes are mainly variations on a repetitious pattern. Analysis of historical realization data then yields operational insight {{that can be used to}} improve or support process management. To gain accurate operations data a software tool, TNV-Prepare, has been developed that filters relevant train detection data from <b>train</b> <b>describer</b> records. This paper starts with a brief account of the collection and preparation of train detection data. Then for the particular case of station Eindhoven a detailed punctuality analysis is reported including the performance of dwell and transfer times (tightness or possible recovery time) and train waiting times to secure connections. Departure delays are predicted from arrival delays using regression analysis, whereas the remaining noise is attributed to human factors. Transport and PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Reliability of railway {{operations}} {{becomes more}} and more demanding with increasing train traffic, which asks for stable and robust timetables capable of neutralizing deviations from scheduled time-distance paths and stabilizing delay propagation. Timetable performance evaluation is thus a crucial aspect in the railway timetable design process to guarantee and maintain reliability of operations. Feedback from realized railway operations is essential to evaluate the performance of the timetable in practice and to find and improve structural shortcomings in the timetable design. This thesis presents the developed software TNV-Prepare which recovers the infrastructure utilization of train traffic from train detection data of the safety and signalling systems based on daily records of the <b>train</b> <b>describer</b> systems, the so-called TNV-logfiles. A case-study at the Dutch railway station Eindhoven demonstrates the potential of a statistical analysis of this train traffic data to identify structural sources of delays. Railway operations are characterized by many network interdependencies resulting from the timetable and shared usage of railway infrastructure. Therefore, a railway timetable must be carefully tested on stability and robustness before implementation using a mathematical model of the scheduled railway operations. This thesis proposes an analytical model for evaluating timetable stability and robustness based on max-plus algebra. The max-plus linear system approach gives a formal stability test based on a max-plus eigenvalue problem, identifies critical events and processes, quantifies robustness in terms of recovery times, and computes the propagation of delays over time and space. The method has been implemented in the software PETER (Performance Evaluation of Timed Events in Railways) which enables users to analyse large-scale network timetables in real-time. A case-study of the Dutch national railway timetable illustrates the developed methodology. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
