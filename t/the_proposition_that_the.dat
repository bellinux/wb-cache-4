5|$|Reflecting {{both the}} realist and liberal {{paradigms}} {{of international relations}} and the conception of national interests, {{a number of other}} important themes in Australian strategic culture are also obvious. Such themes include: an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics, the centrality of notions of Westphalian sovereignty, a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a guarantor of security, and <b>the</b> <b>proposition</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> status quo in international affairs should only be changed peacefully. Likewise, multilateralism, collective security and defence self-reliance have also been important themes. Change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic behaviours have persisted throughout its history, being the product of Australian society's democratic political tradition and Judaeo-Christian Anglo-European heritage, as well its associated values, beliefs and economic, political and religious ideology. These behaviours are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely European island {{on the edge of the}} Asia-Pacific, and the geopolitical circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power. To be sure, during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result, it has frequently become involved in foreign wars. Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers—known colloquially as Diggers—have often been noted, somewhat paradoxically, for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>proposition</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lyrics {{originate}} in 1287 {{is based on}} a manuscript held in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris. A poem starting with the words Subscribere proposui ("I have suggested signing (it)") has two verses that closely resemble the later Gaudeamus igitur verses, although neither the first verse nor the actual words Gaudeamus igitur appear. The music accompanying this poem bears no relation to the melody which is now associated with it. A German translation of these verses was made in about 1717 and published in 1730 without music. A Latin version in a handwritten student songbook, dating from some time between 1723 and 1750, is preserved in the Berlin State Library (formerly located at Marburg); however, this differs considerably from the modern text. The current Latin lyrics with a German translation were published by Halle in 1781 in Studentenlieder ("Students' Songs") written by Christian Wilhelm Kindleben (1748-1785), who admitted to making important changes to the text.|$|E

All the analysis is so elegant that Sir William Rowan Hamilton said the work could be described only as a scientific poem. Lagrange remarked that mechanics was really a branch of pure mathematics analogous to a geometry of four dimensions, namely, {{the time and the}} three coordinates of the point in space; and it is said that he prided himself that from the beginning {{to the end of the}} work there was not a single diagram. At first no printer could be found who would publish the book; but Legendre at last persuaded a Paris firm to undertake it, and it was issued under the supervision of Laplace, Cousin, Legendre (editor) and Condorcet in 1788.|$|E

25|$|Jacques Lacan: Lacan {{went beyond}} <b>the</b> <b>proposition</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{unconscious}} is {{a structure that}} lies beneath the conscious world; the unconscious itself is structured, like a language. This would suggest parallels with Jung. Further Lacan's Symbolic and Imaginary orders may be aligned with Jung's archetypal theory and personal unconscious respectively. The Symbolic order patterns {{the contents of the}} Imaginary {{in the same way that}} archetypal structures predispose humans towards certain sorts of experience. If we take the example of parents, archetypal structures and the Symbolic order predispose our recognition of, and relation to them. Lacan's concept of the Real approaches Jung's elaboration of the psychoid unconscious, which may be seen as true but cannot be directly known. Lacan posited that the unconscious is organised in an intricate network governed by association, above all 'metaphoric associations'. The existence of the network is shown by analysis of the unconscious products: dreams, symptoms, and so on.|$|E

In the early nineteenth century Scottish scientists James Clerk Maxwell and David Brewster played a major part {{in the development of the}} techniques of photography. Pioneering photographers included chemist Robert Adamson (1821–48) and artist David Octavius Hill (1821–48), who as Hill & Adamson formed the first photographic studio in Scotland at Rock House in Edinburgh in 1843. Their output of around 3,000 calotype images in four years are considered some of the first and finest artistic uses of photography.|$|E

40|$|Here {{we present}} a modal logic that emerged when {{considering}} the interactions of awareness and knowledge.

As such, we can model an agent who ignores {{the existence of a}} <b>proposition</b> in <b>the</b> context of some possible worlds. The resulting logic is able to capture reasoning free of logical omni-science, where an agent may, consciously or un-consciously omit facts and deductive rules from their arguments. ...|$|R

500|$|Tax {{protesters in}} the United States advance {{a number of}} {{constitutional}} arguments asserting that the imposition, assessment and collection of the federal income tax violates the United States Constitution. [...] These kinds of arguments, though related to, are distinguished from statutory and administrative arguments, which presuppose {{the constitutionality of the}} income tax, as well as from general conspiracy arguments, which are based upon <b>the</b> <b>proposition</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> three branches of the federal government are involved together in a deliberate, on-going campaign of deception for the purpose of defrauding individuals or entities of their wealth or profits. [...] Although constitutional challenges to U.S. tax laws are frequently directed towards the validity and effect of the Sixteenth Amendment, assertions that the income tax violates various other provisions of the Constitution have been made as well.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} Court's ruling, analysts {{predicted}} {{that the effects of}} the case would be [...] "far-reaching."

Arizona one week earlier, where the Court enlarged protections against the police for criminal suspects. However, in his assessment of Schmerber, Charles L. Berry praised the decision as a [...] "successful effort to find a practical {{solution to the problem of}} the drinking motorist." [...] Additionally, many law journals also offered commentary of the case's significance. For example, a November 1966 article in the Harvard Law Review opined that Justice Brennan's majority opinion was [...] "a good exposition of his view of the interrelationship between the fourth and fifth amendments," [...] and a February 1967 article in the Texas Law Review argued that Schmerber [...] "exemplifies <b>the</b> <b>proposition</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fifth amendment is not absolute." ...|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, {{the late}} empire {{maintained}} a central {{feature of the}} forward defence of the Principate: a system of treaties of mutual assistance with tribes living on the imperial frontiers. The Romans would promise to defend the ally from attack by its neighbours. In return, the ally would promise to refrain from raiding imperial territory, and prevent neighbouring tribes from doing the same. Although the allies would officially be denoted tributarii (i.e. subject to paying tribute to Rome, in cash or in kind), in practice the loyalty of the ally was often secured by gifts or regular subsidies from Rome. This practice was applied on all the frontiers. The Romans continued to assist the client tribes to defend themselves in the 4th century. For example, Constantine I's army constructed two massive lines of defensive earthworks, 100–250km beyond the Danube, totalling c. [...] in length, the Devil's Dykes in Hungary/Romania and the Brazda lui Novac de Nord in Romania. Garrisoned by a mix of Roman and native troops, their purpose was to protect Dacian and Sarmatian tributary tribes of the Tisza and Wallachian plains against Gothic incursions. This created a Transdanubian buffer zone, extending from Aquincum (Budapest) {{all the way to}} the Danube delta, obviously contradicting <b>the</b> <b>proposition</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> empire's Danubian border provinces were themselves envisaged as buffer zones. (This was especially unlikely in the case of these regions, as the Illyrian emperors and officer class that dominated the late army would hardly relish seeing their native provinces reduced to combat zones).|$|E

500|$|The {{domestic}} {{supply of}} nickel {{was at that}} time produced by a mine at Gap, Pennsylvania, owned by industrialist Joseph Wharton. [...] On March19, Pollock wrote to Chase that they had no more nickel, nor was any available from overseas; [...] "we are thus shut up to the home supply; from the works of Mr. Wharton". [...] Opposed to the removal of nickel from the cent, Wharton published a pamphlet in April 1864 proposing coinage of one-, two-, three-, five-, and ten-cent pieces of an alloy of one part nickel to three of copper, doubling the percentage of nickel used in the cent. Despite Wharton's efforts, on April20, a select committee of the House of Representatives endorsed the bill. [...] It was opposed by Pennsylvania's Thaddeus Stevens, who represented the mining area from which Wharton extracted his nickel. Wharton had spent $200,000 to develop his mine and ore refinement machinery, Stevens related, and it was unfair to deprive him of the major use of his metal. [...] "Shall we destroy all this property because by coining with another metal more money may be saved to the government?" [...] Besides, he argued, the copper-nickel alloy for the cent had been approved by Congress, and the new metal, which he termed [...] "brass", would show rust. He was rebutted by Iowa Congressman John A. Kasson, chairman of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, who stated that the bronze alloy did not resemble brass, and he could not support <b>the</b> <b>proposition</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government is bound to purchase from a supplier because he has spent money in anticipation of sales.|$|E
