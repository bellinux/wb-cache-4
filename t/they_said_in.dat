2500|$|Finding someone's {{remains in}} Jesus' tomb {{conforms}} to the Muslim belief that a substitute for him was crucified, while he was raised bodily to heaven.

The general Muslim interpretation of the verse is that God, to revenge from Judas' betrayal to Jesus (the fatherless prophet), made his face {{similar to that of}} Jesus, while Jesus ascended into heaven and is to return near the end of time and kill the anti-Christ. Accordingly, the discovered remains in his tomb would then actually belong to Judas, a Roman guard, or a volunteering disciple.|$|E

2500|$|The {{school of}} Rabbi Yannai {{interpreted}} the place name Di-zahab (...) in [...] {{to refer to}} one of the Israelites' sins that Moses recounted in the opening of his address. The school of Rabbi Yannai deduced from the word Di-zahab that Moses spoke insolently towards heaven.
