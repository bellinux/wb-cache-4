In 2006, foreign investment in Israel totaled $13billion, according to the Manufacturers Association of Israel. The Financial Times said that 'bombs drop, yet Israel's economy grows'. Moreover, while Israel's <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> external <b>debt</b> is US$95billion, or approximately 41.6% of GDP, since 2001 it has become a net lender nation in terms of net external debt (the total value of assets vs. liabilities in debt instruments owed abroad), which [...] stood at a significant surplus of US$60billion. The country also maintains a current account surplus in an amount equivalent to about 3% of its gross domestic product in 2010.|$|R

Around {{the start of the}} 21st century, Morocco's overall deficit stood at 5.3 percent of GDP, and <b>gross</b> <b>total</b> government <b>debt</b> amounted to three-fourths of GDP. In 2007, reflecting a strong improvement in revenue performance and moderate growth in expenditure, the budget was close to balance. Under the combined effect of a prudent fiscal policy and sizeable privatization receipts, the total debt stock had shrunk by 20 percentage points, and now stands at a little over half of GDP. As a result, perceptions of Morocco's creditworthiness have improved.|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to revisit}} {{the issue of the}} {{sustainability}} of public indebtedness in Brazil, investigating the evolution of <b>gross</b> <b>debt</b> of public sector, the relationship between its liabilities and assets of the public sector, the future implications of <b>gross</b> <b>debt</b> to net debt and to make forecast of the <b>gross</b> <b>debt</b> of the general government for the next two years. We show that the examination of the concept of net <b>debt</b> (<b>gross</b> <b>debt</b> less public sector assets) can cover up important questions about the public indebtedness. We ask if one can have some idea about the future behavior of net debt based on the present performance of <b>gross</b> <b>debt.</b> In this context, we conducted a Granger causality test between the net (DLGG) and <b>gross</b> <b>debt</b> (DBGG) of the general government. Empirical results show that DBGG Granger cause DLGG. We apply the Dynamic Factorial Model (MFD) to make forecast on the <b>gross</b> <b>debt</b> of public sector and its major components. The results display a strong rise in foreign debt and repurchase agreements. In August 2016 they reach, respectively, 10 % and 17 % of GDP. The results also show the forecast of the net debt (DLSP). It is shown that DLSP reaches 44 % of GDP in August 2016. The GDP also shows sharp drop in economic activity. From September 2015 to August 2016 this variable decreases around 3. 5 %. Finally, we check the effect the indebtedness on economic growth.

30|$|In this paper, {{relations}} between public debt, economic growth, and {{long-term interest rates}} in Switzerland from 1894 to 2014 are examined. For this purpose, an original long-term dataset on the general <b>gross</b> public <b>debt</b> in Switzerland, namely the aggregation of the Confederation <b>gross</b> <b>debt,</b> the cantons’ <b>gross</b> <b>debts,</b> and the municipal <b>gross</b> <b>debts,</b> was reconstructed. Three different statistical approaches are performed to study {{relations between}} this aggregated debt, economic growth, and interest rates. The first consists {{of the study of}} correlations between GDP-weighted variables, the second is the study of the correlation between residuals of ARIMA time series models, and the last one studies vector autoregression (VAR) models, allowing us to test Granger causalities between variables. Every approach is performed on the whole time period but also on boom phases and recession phases independently. All the results suggest that the public debt during this period in Switzerland did not {{have a negative impact on}} economic growth and did not raise long-term interest rates.|$|R

50|$|Republican Congressional leaders {{launched}} an aggressive opposition against the bill, {{claiming that the}} tax increase would only make matters worse. Republicans were united in this opposition, and every Republican {{in both houses of}} Congress voted against the proposal. In fact, it took Vice President Gore's tie-breaking vote in the Senate to pass the bill. After extensive lobbying by the Clinton administration, the House narrowly voted in favor of the bill by a vote of 218 to 216. The budget package expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) as relief to low-income families. It reduced the amount they paid in federal income and Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA), providing $21 billion in relief for 15 million low-income families. Improved economic conditions and policies served to encourage investors in the bond market, leading to a decline in long-term interest rates. Clinton's final four budgets were balanced budgets with surpluses, beginning with the 1997 budget. The surplus money was used to pay down the public debt by $452 billion, though the <b>gross</b> federal <b>debt</b> continued to increase. However, the claimed surplus was only recorded against public debt which was calculated with the exclusion of intragovernmental holdings. This meant that the administration was able to record loans deducted from {{the social security trust fund}} as revenue on budget reports, which accounted for the bulk of the surplus money. Calculating both the intragovernmental holdings from the public debt, the lowest deficit was $17.9 billion; in effect, the alleged surplus was, supposedly, a mere accounting fiction.The <b>total</b> national <b>debt</b> (<b>gross</b> federal <b>debt)</b> rose every year of the Clinton administration from $4.3 trillion to $5.6 trillion and from $5.4 trillion to $5.6 trillion over the years where the surplus was claimed.|$|R

40|$|On July 21, 2011, {{the heads}} of {{government}} of the euro area announced a new plan to address the Greek debt crisis. This policy brief presents a simulation exercise that examines whether the new arrangements are likely to provide a sustainable solution. The analysis focuses on four key measures: <b>gross</b> <b>debt</b> relative to GDP; net debt relative to GDP; net interest payments relative to GDP; and amortization of medium- and long-term debt coming due during the year in question, relative to GDP. The new Greek package shows prospective future progress on all four measures, and Greek debt looks much more sustainable after the package than before. Debt also appears considerably more manageable if the criterion is net debt or interest burden rather than <b>gross</b> <b>debt</b> ratio, although even for <b>gross</b> <b>debt</b> the ratio is down substantially by 2020.

40|$|Each country note has the {{following}} structure: Section 1 gives {{a brief overview}} of the main economic developments in recent years in the relevant country including real GDP, fiscal balance and <b>gross</b> <b>debt</b> figures. This presentation is mainly based on the “OECD Economic Outlook No. 88 ”, OECD Economic Outlook: Statistics and Projections (database) (OECD, 2010 a), and uses OECD definitions of general government balance and <b>gross</b> <b>debt</b> which may differ from national definitions (see Box 2. 1). Section 2 presents the government’s fiscal consolidation strategies as manifested in fiscal balance and <b>gross</b> <b>debt</b> targets over the medium term, the size of the consolidation, and the composition of expenditures and revenues. Section 2 is based on information from the national authorities (or publicly available information) which may use other definitions of fiscal balance and <b>gross</b> <b>debt</b> than the OECD in Section 1. For example, most EU countries have reported such figures on a Maastricht basis. Major consolidation measures are given in Section 3, quantified to the largest extent possible in local currencies and current prices annually. Expenditure measures are split between operational and programme measures and other initiatives. Revenue measures are listed without categories. Updates and additional consolidation measures may have been adopted in member countries after the data collection ended in November/December 2010, but are outside the scope of this analysis. Table 1 summarises the government’s specific consolidation measures and their impact. The impact is given in per cent of nominal GDP, calculated by the OECD Secretariat by using nominal forecasts of GDP from the “OECD Economic Outlook No. 88 ”, OECD Economic Outlook: Statistics and Projections (database) (OECD, 2010 a). Eventual pension reforms are also included in this section. Section 4 provides recent or planned institutional reforms.

S. government relative to gross domestic product increased substantially since the financial crisis and the Great Recession that began in 2007, but the debt ratio has been increasing since 2001. <b>Gross</b> <b>debt</b> relative to GDP increased from 55 percent in 2001 to 67 percent in 2007 to 107 percent in 2012 Comparable figures for debt held by the public (net <b>debt</b> or <b>gross</b> <b>debt</b> minus debt held by various government agencies) were 80 percent in 2011 and 84 percent in May 2012 (IMF 2012). As a result, the debt ratio is now the highest in U. S. history, except for World War II, when it reached 125 percent of GDP (Bohn 2010). U.
