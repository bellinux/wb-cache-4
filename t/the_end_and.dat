5|$|In 2012, Thompson wrote The Further Tale of Peter Rabbit as an {{addition}} to the Peter Rabbit series by Beatrix Potter to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the publication of The Tale of Peter Rabbit. She was approached by the publishers to write it, the first authorised Peter story since 1930 {{and the only one}} not written by Potter. The book falls {{in the middle of the}} earlier series, rather than at <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>and</b> takes Peter Rabbit outside of Mr. McGregor's garden and into Scotland. It was a New York Times Best Seller. In 2013, Thompson wrote a second book in the series titled The Christmas Tale of Peter Rabbit.|$|E
5|$|In {{denial about}} the dire situation, Hitler placed his hopes on the units {{commanded}} by Waffen-SS General Felix Steiner, the Armeeabteilung Steiner ("Army Detachment Steiner"). On 21 April, Hitler ordered Steiner {{to attack the}} northern flank of the encircling Soviet salient and ordered the German Ninth Army, south-east of Berlin, to attack northward in a pincer attack. By that evening, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of Berlin. At his afternoon situation conference on 22 April, Hitler was told Steiner's forces had not moved. Hitler fell into a tearful rage when he realised that the attack {{was not going to}} be carried out. He openly declared for the first time the war was lost—and blamed his generals. He announced he would stay in Berlin until <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> then shoot himself.|$|E

Luger came into the match near <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> performed a running forearm smash on Eli. Jacob tried to throw Luger with a powerbomb, but Luger tagged in Smith, who performed a sunset flip to pin Jacob and win the match.|$|E

He harbors homosexual feelings towards Okabe, who calls him by a nickname , and thinks of Luka as his pupil. He is 16 years old. While he does become a female for part of the story and in most of the time lines throughout the story, canonically he is male by <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>and</b> in only one of multiple time lines Luka was female.|$|E

5|$|Paramount Pictures {{commissioned}} the film after the positive critical and commercial reaction to The Wrath of Khan. Nimoy directed the film, {{becoming the first}} Star Trek cast member to do so. Producer Harve Bennett wrote the script starting from <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> working back, and intended {{the destruction of the}} Enterprise to be a shocking development. Bennett and Nimoy collaborated with effects house Industrial Light & Magic to develop storyboards and new ship designs; ILM also handled the film's many special effects sequences. Aside from a single day of location shooting, all of the film's scenes were shot on Paramount and ILM soundstages. Composer James Horner returned to expand his themes from the previous film.|$|E
5|$|Producer Lauren Shuler Donner {{had hoped}} to start filming in March 2002, but {{production}} did not begin until June 17, 2002 in Vancouver and ended by November. Over sixty-four sets were used in thirty-eight different locations. The film crew encountered problems when there was insufficient snow in Kananaskis, Alberta for them to use for some scenes. A large amount of fake snow was then applied. The idea to have Jean Grey sacrifice herself at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> to be resurrected in a third installment was highly secretive.

The club still managed to win the Supercoppa Italiana that year, with a record 5–1 victory against Juventus, {{but it would be}} their last major trophy for 22 years. However, in the European Cup, they were eliminated in the second round.|$|E
