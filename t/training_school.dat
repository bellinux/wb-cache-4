5|$|No.1 Elementary Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> {{was formed}} as No.2 Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> in Melbourne on 6November 1939. Its inaugural {{commanding}} officer was Squadron Leader F.J.B. Wight. On 13December, the school moved to Parafield, South Australia, after building work was completed there. Parafield {{was home to}} the South Australian Aero Club, {{and it was the}} airfield's position as the hub of civilian flight instruction in the state that led to it becoming the base for the first flying school the RAAF raised during World WarII. The same principle was followed in establishing No.3 Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> (later renamed No.2 Elementary Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School)</b> at Archerfield, Queensland, No.3 Elementary Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> at Essendon, Victoria, and No.4 Elementary Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> at Mascot, New South Wales.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} GCCS operations, the General Post Office (GPO) {{established}} a <b>training</b> <b>school,</b> and a women's {{teacher training college}} was opened in 1948. The Ministry of Aviation also opened the Navaid <b>training</b> <b>school</b> on part of the site. The GPO had blocks built in the south-east area of the site, and other blocks were adapted from their original conditions for new uses. The CTS division of GCHQ remained on the site within Blocks C and D until 1987. Aerial masts which had been erected by the division became unusable after the nearby train line was electrified, and were removed the year CTS left.|$|E
5|$|In December 1939, {{soon after}} the {{outbreak}} of World WarII, King joined the RAAF as a squadron leader. Initially considered for general flying duties, he was assigned training commands commencing in the new year. On 2January 1940, he became the inaugural commanding officer of No.3 Elementary Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> (No.3 EFTS) in Essendon, Victoria. Part of Australia's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme, No.3 EFTS initially comprised a significant civilian presence, many of the aircraft and staff under King's control being from private airline companies and the Royal Victorian Aero Club; by July, all private machines had been pressed into RAAF service and the civilian element largely disappeared. King assumed command of No.5 Elementary Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> at Narromine, New South Wales, on 21December. Promoted to wing commander, he took over No.1 Service Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, from Group Captain John McCauley on 7July 1941. In October, King was promoted to acting group captain and posted to command the newly established Station Headquarters Point Cook.|$|E

He was awarded his wings and commissioned {{as a pilot}} officer on 28June 1940. Following advanced training on Avro Ansons with No.1 Service Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> at RAAF Point Cook in September, he was selected to become a flight instructor. He completed the requisite course at Central Flying School in Camden, New South Wales, and was promoted to flying officer on 28December. He subsequently began training students under the Empire Air Training Scheme at No.2 Service Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> near Wagga Wagga, {{under the command of}} Group Captain Frederick Scherger.|$|E

5|$|Shannon {{was born}} on 27 May 1922 at Unley Park, South Australia. His father, Howard Huntley Shannon, served as a South Australian state parliamentarian from 1933 to 1968. Shannon was working for an {{insurance}} company {{when he joined the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Reserve in Adelaide on 5July 1940, aged eighteen. On 4January 1941 he transferred to the RAAF as an air cadet under the Empire Air Training Scheme. He received his instruction in Western Australia at No.5 Initial <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> in Pearce, No.9 Elementary Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> in Cunderdin, and No. 4 Service Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> in Geraldton.

5|$|The {{school was}} re-established in 1946 as No.1 FTS at RAAF Station Uranquinty, New South Wales, and {{transferred}} to Point Cook the following year. Under a restructure of flying training {{to cope with the}} demands of the Korean War and Malayan Emergency, No.1 FTS was re-formed in 1952 as No.1 Applied Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> (No.1 AFTS); it moved to RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, in 1958. For much of this period the school was also responsible for training the RAAF's air traffic controllers. Its pilot trainees included Army, Navy, and foreign students as well as Air Force personnel. The RAAF's reorganisation of aircrew training in the early 1950s had led to the formation at Uranquinty of No.1 Basic Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> (No.1 BFTS), which transferred to Point Cook in 1958. In 1969, No.1 AFTS was re-formed as No.2 Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> and No.1 BFTS was re-formed as No.1 FTS. Rationalisation of RAAF flying training resulted in the disbandment of No.1 FTS in 1993.|$|E
5|$|With the {{ambition}} {{of becoming a}} pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force, Crombie undertook instruction in civil flying. Completing his course, he enlisted in the Air Force on 24 May 1940. He was initially posted to RAAF Station Richmond, before transferring to No.2 Initial <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> at RAAF Bradfield Park in June, where he was advanced to leading aircraftman. The following month, Crombie was attached to No.5 Empire Flight <b>Training</b> <b>School.</b> On finishing his stint with the unit, he was posted to No.2 Embarkion Depot on 18 September. In a ceremony two days later, Crombie married Betty Deane-Butcher; the couple would later have a son.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} his tenure with No.1 Squadron in December 1935, Bladin was appointed Officer Commanding Cadet Squadron at No.1 Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School.</b> He modelled the squadron's training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, RAAF College, {{which would be}} established in 1947. On 12March 1937, {{he was promoted to}} wing commander.|$|E
5|$|After his {{military}} service, he founded a firm with Eldar Sharon (until 1964) and Alfred Neumann (until 1966). The physical {{and economic conditions}} in Israel at the time, allowed them to complete {{a fair number of}} works in a relatively brief period of time, which brought international attention. Their joint works include the Mediterranean Sea Club in Achzib (1960–1961), Dubiner House (1963), the Chaim Laskov Officer <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> (1963–1967) Bahad 1, the main officer <b>training</b> <b>school</b> of the Israel Defense Forces, just later the synagogue (1969–1971) at the same academy, and the Bat Yam city hall (1963–1969). Their designs shared aspects in common with the metabolist movement, borrowing metaphoric shapes from nature for use in planning morphological structures. The modularity of these works, such as the Dubiner House, provided an architectural precedent for the Habitat 67 project by Moshe Safdie.|$|E
5|$|Bladin became Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24November 1948; this {{position}} {{gave him a}} seat on the Air Board, which consisted of the RAAF's most senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff. He succeeded Joe Hewitt, and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated. RAAF Staff College was opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, providing an advanced defence course aimed at squadron leaders and wing commanders; various international facilities were also utilised to further officers' education. In October, Bladin became involved in the push for a Junior Equipment and Administrative Training Scheme to offer apprenticeships to clerical and supply staff, which was established two years later. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the King's Birthday Honours announced in June 1950. In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, he sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their degree qualifications with formal teaching credentials. Over the following year, in response to increased demands for aircrew to meet Australia's commitments to the Malayan Emergency and the Korean War, pilot training was broken out from a single all-encompassing course at No.1 Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> (No.1 FTS) in Point Cook, Victoria, into separate courses at the newly formed No.1 Initial Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> at Archerfield, Queensland, No.1 Basic Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> at Uranquinty, New South Wales, and No.1 Applied Flying <b>Training</b> <b>School</b> (re-formed from No.1 FTS) at Point Cook.|$|E
