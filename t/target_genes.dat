5|$|RNA {{sequences}} (siRNA and miRNA) {{that are}} complementary {{to parts of}} a promoter can increase gene transcription, a phenomenon dubbed RNA activation. Part of the mechanism for how these RNA upregulate genes is known: dicer and argonaute are involved, possibly via histone demethylation. miRNAs have been proposed to upregulate their <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> upon cell cycle arrest, via unknown mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises a gene is difficult. Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do not necessarily have {{to be close to}} the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can be much larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> on another chromosome.|$|E
5|$|RNAi in vivo {{delivery}} to tissues still eludes science—especially to tissues {{deep within the}} body. RNAi delivery is only easily accessible to surface tissues such as the eye and respiratory tract. In these instances, siRNA {{has been used in}} direct contact with the tissue for transport. The resulting RNAi successfully focused on <b>target</b> <b>genes.</b> When delivering siRNA to deep tissues, the siRNA must be protected from nucleases, but targeting specific areas becomes the main difficulty. This difficulty has been combatted with high dosage levels of siRNA to ensure the tissues have been reached, however in these cases hepatotoxicity was reported.|$|E
30|$|RNAhybrid {{software}} {{was performed to}} predict <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> of miRNA in the sequencing. GO enrichment analysis in our study was successful at predicted <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> candidates of all differentially expressed miRNAs compared to the reference gene background, {{as well as the}} genes that corresponded to certain biological function. Goseq and topGO will be used to describe the enrichment level for each GO term. This method maps all <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> candidates to GO terms in the database ([URL] calculating the gene numbers for each term, then use hypergeometric test to find significantly enriched GO terms in <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> candidates comparing to the reference gene background. We used the Bonferroni Correction for the p value to obtain a corrected p-value. GO terms with corrected p value ≤ 0.05 are defined as significantly enriched in <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> candidates.|$|R
30|$|KEGG is {{the major}} public pathway-related database. KEGG pathway {{analysis}} identified significantly enriched metabolic pathways or signal transduction pathways in <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> candidates of all differentially expressed miRNAs comparing with the whole reference gene background (Kanehisa et al. 2008). The calculating formula {{was the same as}} that in the GO analysis. Where N was the number of all genes with a KEGG annotation, n was the number of <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> candidates in N, M was the number of all genes annotated to a certain pathway, and m was the number of <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> candidates in M. Genes with a Q value ≤ 0.05 were considered as significantly enriched in <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> candidates. The KEGG analysis could reveal the main pathways which the <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> candidates are involved in.|$|R
30|$|Expression of a <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> in {{prokaryotic cell}} or/and {{eukaryotic}} cell {{has become a}} common research goal or a basic experimental procedure for profound researches of genes of interest since Herbert Boyer and Stanley N. Cohen initiated the genetic engineering era. PCR has been indispensible for gene cloning because it can provide <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> fragments in vitro in large amount and short time without the limitation of restriction sites. As a result, the mainstream strategy {{for the construction of}} recombinant expression vector includes two cloning steps: PCR cloning (cloning of PCR amplified <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> into cloning vector) and restriction enzyme mediated subcloning of <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> from cloning vector into expression vector. Direct cloning of PCR amplified <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> into expression vector via double-restriction of PCR products is optional, but the uncertainty of the accuracy of artificially synthesized restriction site in PCR primers makes trouble-shooting difficult if the cloning experiment fails.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} control which genes are being transcribed, the cell {{separates}} some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical {{access to the}} DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, {{in the case of}} NF-κB-controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory responses, transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-α, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-κB. A nuclear localisation signal on the NF-κB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the <b>target</b> <b>genes.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the archaea evolved from gram-positive bacteria in response to antibiotic selection pressure. This {{is suggested by the}} observation that archaea are resistant {{to a wide variety of}} antibiotics that are primarily produced by gram-positive bacteria, and that these antibiotics primarily act on the genes that distinguish archaea from bacteria. The proposal is that the selective pressure towards resistance generated by the gram-positive antibiotics was eventually sufficient to cause extensive changes in many of the antibiotics' <b>target</b> <b>genes,</b> and that these strains represented the common ancestors of present-day Archaea. The evolution of Archaea in response to antibiotic selection, or any other competitive selective pressure, could also explain their adaptation to extreme environments (such as high temperature or acidity) as the result of a search for unoccupied niches to escape from antibiotic-producing organisms; Cavalier-Smith has made a similar suggestion. This proposal is also supported by other work investigating protein structural relationships and studies that suggest that gram-positive bacteria may constitute the earliest branching lineages within the prokaryotes.|$|E
5|$|Organisms vary {{in their}} ability to take up foreign dsRNA and use it in the RNAi pathway. The effects of RNA {{interference}} can be both systemic and heritable in plants and C. elegans, although not in Drosophila or mammals. In plants, RNAi is thought to propagate by the transfer of siRNAs between cells through plasmodesmata (channels in the cell walls that enable communication and transport). Heritability comes from methylation of promoters targeted by RNAi; the new methylation pattern is copied in each new generation of the cell. A broad general distinction between plants and animals lies in the targeting of endogenously produced miRNAs; in plants, miRNAs are usually perfectly or nearly perfectly complementary to their <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> and induce direct mRNA cleavage by RISC, while animals' miRNAs tend to be more divergent in sequence and induce translational repression. This translational effect may be produced by inhibiting the interactions of translation initiation factors with the messenger RNA's polyadenine tail.|$|E
40|$|The skin is an {{attractive}} tissue for regulated <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> expression {{by virtue of its}} accessibility to topical regulating stimuli. We have used synthetic ligand-driven intracellular oligomerization to accomplish specific <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> regulation in human skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts. GAL 4 DNA binding domains and VP 16 transactivation domains, each linked to the FK 506 binding protein, were expressed in normal human skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts. These hybrid proteins underwent heterodimerization via the novel intracellular dimerizing agent FK 1012 to generate a heterodimeric activator of <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> expression in vitro. Dimeric FK 1012, but not monomeric FK 506 M induced <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> expression in a dose-dependent fashion. FK 1012 exerted no detectable nonspecific effects on expression of cutaneous genes and did not alter cellular proliferation kinetics. Controlled oligomerization of hybrid transcription activators offers a potential approach to <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> regulation in cells of normal human skin...|$|R
40|$|Enhancers {{are short}} {{regulatory}} regions (50 - 1500 bp) of DNA {{that control the}} tissue-specific activation of gene expression by long distance interaction with <b>targeting</b> <b>gene</b> regions. Recently, genome-wide identification of enhancers in diverse tissues and cell lines was achieved using high-throughput sequencing. Enhancers {{have been associated with}} malfunctions in cancer development resulting from point mutations in regulatory regions. However, the potential impact of copy number variations (CNVs) on enhancer regions is unknown. To learn more about the relationship between enhancers and cancer, we integrated the CNVs data on enhancers and explored their <b>targeting</b> <b>gene</b> expression pattern in high-grade ovarian cancer. Using human enhancer-gene interaction data with 13, 691 interaction pairs between 7, 905 enhancers and 5, 297 <b>targeting</b> <b>genes,</b> we found that the 2, 910 copy number gain events of enhancer are significantly correlated with the up-regulation of <b>targeting</b> <b>genes.</b> We further identified that a number of highly mutated superenhancers, with concordant gene expression change on their <b>targeting</b> <b>genes.</b> We also identified 18 <b>targeting</b> <b>genes</b> by super-enhancers with prognostic significance for ovarian cancer, such as the tumour suppressor CDKN 1 B. We are the first to report that abundant copy number variations on enhancers could change the expression of their <b>targeting</b> <b>genes</b> which would be valuable for the design of enhancer-based cancer treatment strategy. © Li et al...|$|R
40|$|We {{constructed}} a novel cancer-specific regulatable adenoviral expression system comprising two vectors: one expressing rtTA, a reverse tetracycline transactivator {{regulated by the}} human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene promoter, the other expressing the <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> regulated by the tetracycline response element (TRE). rtTA transactivates <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> expression {{in the presence of}} doxycycline. Using these vectors, we {{constructed a}}n adenoviral expression system, the Tel-On system, which enables highly efficient <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> transduction. This system enabled efficient and regulatable cancer-specific gene expression, and can be used in <b>targeted</b> cancer <b>gene</b> therapy. Key words: hTERT; Tet-On system; adenovirus; cance...|$|R

25|$|Several {{transcriptomics}} technologies {{can be used}} {{to generate}} the necessary data to analyse. DNA microarrays measure the relative activity of previously identified <b>target</b> <b>genes.</b> Sequence based techniques, like RNA-Seq, provide information on the sequences of genes in addition to their expression level.|$|E

5000|$|... sRNAs {{can either}} bind to protein targets, and modify the {{function}} of the bound protein, or bind to mRNA <b>targets</b> and regulate <b>gene</b> expression. Antisense sRNAs can be categorised as cis-encoded sRNAs, where there is an overlap between the antisense sRNA <b>gene</b> and the <b>target</b> <b>gene,</b> and trans-encoded sRNAs, where the antisense sRNA gene is separate from the <b>target</b> <b>gene.</b>|$|R

25|$|During {{development}} of the aortic arch and the aortic arch arteries, the Notch receptors, ligands, and <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> display a unique expression pattern. When the Notch pathway was blocked, the induction of vascular smooth muscle cell marker expression failed to occur, suggesting that Notch {{is involved in the}} differentiation of cardiac neural crest cells into vascular cells during outflow tract development.|$|E
25|$|Notch {{signaling}} can {{regulate the}} atrioventricular boundary formation between the AV canal and the chamber myocardium. Studies {{have revealed that}} both loss- and gain-of-function of the Notch pathway results in defects in AV canal development. In addition, the Notch <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> HEY1 and HEY2 are involved in restricting the expression of two critical developmental regulator proteins, BMP2 and Tbx2, to the AV canal.|$|E
25|$|Not all proneural {{genes are}} equally {{sensitive}} to lateral inhibition. For example, in Xenopus, Chitnis and Kintner demonstrated that ‘’XASH-3’’ and NeuroD (achaete-scute complex) respond differently to lateral inhibition, which reflect different ability to activate <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> and differential susceptibility of these <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> to repression by notch. Posterior studies revealed {{that even when}} Notch/Delta signaling pathway is blocked, Wnt2b is capable of inhibiting neuronal differentiation, through the downregulation of mRNA expression of multiple proneural genes and also of Notch1. With this mechanism Wnt2b maintains progenitor cells undifferentiated by attenuating the expression of proneural and neurogenic genes, preventing cells from getting into the differentiation cascade regulated by proneural genes and Notch. Although notch signaling {{is involved in the}} control of proneural gene expression, positive-feedback loops are required to increase or maintain the levels of proneural genes. The transcription factors responsible for this maintenance can act through the inhibition of the notch signaling pathway in particular cells or at a post-transcriptional level, affecting proneural genes transcription and function.|$|E
30|$|The {{selection}} process of traditional breeding almost depends on field selection by experience of breeders. However, this selection has many inevitable defects including time-consuming, low predictability and reproducibility. Although marker-assisted selection (MAS) using markers {{on the basis}} of DNA sequence has greatly facilitate the accurate and diminish the time-cost of selection, unavoidable recombination limited precision of selection between <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> and markers, which mostly is linkage with <b>target</b> <b>gene.</b> But the {{selection process}} of Update breeding used in this study has no concern of omit <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> by using marker within gene.|$|R
30|$|Due to {{the tissue}} {{specificity}} of the reference genes[24 – 27], {{the results for}} each examined <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> are not identical relative to the individual reference genes (especially in the heart). However, for both housekeeping genes, the relative levels of <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> expression presented almost {{the same pattern of}} changes.|$|R
30|$|Meanwhile, we {{designed}} four SNP markers anchored {{upstream and downstream}} of <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> at the process of selection using the Update method; those four markers are used to eliminate the drag of non-target segments surrounding the <b>target</b> <b>gene.</b> This process cannot achieve by using MAS, no mention to field selection process.|$|R
25|$|Glucocorticoids bind to the cytosolic {{glucocorticoid}} receptor (GR), a type {{of nuclear}} receptor that is activated by ligand binding. After a hormone binds to the corresponding receptor, the newly formed complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> resulting in the regulation of gene expression. This process is {{commonly referred to as}} transcriptional activation, or transactivation.|$|E
25|$|EMT's {{important}} {{feature is the}} loss of membrane E-cadherin in adherens junctions, where β-catenin may play a significant role. Translocation of β-catenin from adherens junctions to the nucleus may lead to a loss of E-cadherin and subsequently to EMT. Nuclear β-catenin apparently can directly, transcriptionally activate EMT-associated <b>target</b> <b>genes,</b> such as the E-cadherin gene repressor SLUG (also known as SNAI2). Mechanical properties of the tumor microenvironment, such as hypoxia, can contribute to CSC survival and metastatic potential through stabilization of hypoxia inducible factors through interactions with ROS (reactive oxygen species).|$|E
25|$|The sensing of {{temperature}} in cells {{is known as}} thermoception and is primarily mediated by transient receptor potential channels. Additionally, animal cells contain a conserved mechanism to prevent high temperatures from causing cellular damage, the heat-shock response. Such response is triggered when high temperatures cause the dissociation of inactive HSF1 from complexes with heat shock proteins Hsp40/Hsp70 and Hsp90. With help from the ncRNA hsr1, HSF1 then trimerizes, becoming active and upregulating the expression of its <b>target</b> <b>genes.</b> Many other thermosensory mechanisms exist in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.|$|E
50|$|These methods involve {{altering}} gene length via insertion and deletion mutations. An {{example is}} the Tandem Repeat Inserstion (TRINS) method. This technique results in the generation of tandem repeats of random fragments of the <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> via rolling circle amplification and concurrent incorporation of these repeats into the <b>target</b> <b>gene.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>targeting</b> is the in situ {{manipulation}} of the sequence of an endogenous gene {{by the introduction of}} homologous exogenous DNA. Presently, the rate of <b>gene</b> <b>targeting</b> is too low for it to be broadly used in mammalian somatic cell genetics or to cure genetic diseases. Recently, it has been demonstrated that infection with recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors can mediate <b>gene</b> <b>targeting</b> in somatic cells, but the mechanism is unclear. This paper explores the balance between random integration and <b>gene</b> <b>targeting</b> with rAAV. Both random integration and spontaneous <b>gene</b> <b>targeting</b> are dependent on the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of rAAV. It has previously been shown that the introduction of a DNA double-stranded break (DSB) in a <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> can stimulate <b>gene</b> <b>targeting</b> by several-thousand-fold in somatic cells. Creation of a DSB stimulates the frequency of rAAV-mediated <b>gene</b> <b>targeting</b> by over 100 -fold, suggesting that the mechanism of rAAV-mediated <b>gene</b> <b>targeting</b> involves, at least in part, the repair of DSBs by homologous recombination. Absolute <b>gene</b> <b>targeting</b> frequencies reach 0. 8 % with a dual vector system in which one rAAV vector provides a <b>gene</b> <b>targeting</b> substrate and a second vector expresses the nuclease that creates a DSB in the <b>target</b> <b>gene.</b> The frequencies of <b>gene</b> <b>targeting</b> that we achieved with relatively low MOIs suggest that combining rAAV vectors with DSBs is a promising strategy to broaden the application of <b>gene</b> <b>targeting...</b>|$|R
25|$|Two {{functions}} {{have been}} identified in AR that have critical roles in the regulation of <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> transactivation, the N-terminal activation function 1 (AF1) and the C-terminal activation function 2 (AF2). AF1 is ligand-independent and plays the primary role in <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> transactivation. The AF2 is a ligand-dependent and only shows limited function.|$|R
25|$|Plakoglobin (also called gamma-catenin) has {{a strikingly}} similar {{architecture}} {{to that of}} beta-catenin. Not only their ARM domains resemble each other in both architecture and ligand binding capacity, but the N-terminal β-TrCP-binding motif is also conserved in plakoglobin, implying common ancestry and shared regulation with β-catenin. However, plakoglobin is a very weak transactivator when bound to DNA – this is probably caused by the divergence of their C-terminal sequences (plakoglobin appears to lack the transactivator motifs, and thus inhibits the Wnt pathway <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> instead of activating them).|$|E
25|$|Genetic engineering, {{recombinant}} DNA technology, genetic modification/manipulation (GM) {{and gene}} splicing are terms {{that apply to}} the direct manipulation of an organism's genes. Unlike traditional breeding, an indirect method of genetic manipulation, genetic engineering utilizes modern tools such as molecular cloning and transformation to directly alter the structure and characteristics of <b>target</b> <b>genes.</b> Genetic engineering techniques have found success in numerous applications. Some examples include the improvement of crop technology (not a medical application, but see biological systems engineering), the manufacture of synthetic human insulin {{through the use of}} modified bacteria, the manufacture of erythropoietin in hamster ovary cells, and the production of new types of experimental mice such as the oncomouse (cancer mouse) for research.|$|E
25|$|Jagged1 (JAG1) {{is one of}} five cell surface {{proteins}} (ligands) that {{interact with}} 4 receptors in the mammalian Notch signaling pathway. The Notch Signaling Pathway is a highly conserved pathway that functions to establish and regulate cell fate decisions in many organ systems. Once the JAG1-NOTCH (receptor-ligand) interactions take place, a cascade of proteolytic cleavages is triggered resulting in activation of the transcription for downstream <b>target</b> <b>genes.</b> Located on human chromosome 20, the JAG1 gene is expressed in multiple organ systems in the body and causes the autosomal dominant disorder Alagille syndrome (ALGS) resulting from loss of function mutations within the gene. JAG1 has also been designated as CD339 (cluster of differentiation 339).|$|E
30|$|The dicistronic vector pO-RFP can be {{assembled}} by cloning <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> into the MCS located in ORF 1. In order {{to test whether}} the expression of <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> in ORF 1 can be indicated by the fluorescence reporter mCherry, the model protein eGFP coding sequence as the <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> was subsequently inserted into the MCS, substituting for the original short ORF 1. Because there is no overlap of the excitation and emission spectra of mCherry and eGFP, it is convenient to detect the expression of mCherrry and eGFP simultaneously by a fluorescence method (Shaner et al. 2004; Tsien 1998).|$|R

50|$|The use of {{synthetic}} oligonucleotides in gene therapy is to deactivate the genes {{involved in the}} disease process. There are several methods by which this is achieved. One strategy uses antisense specific to the <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> to disrupt the transcription of the faulty gene. Another uses small molecules of RNA called siRNA to signal the cell to cleave specific unique sequences in the mRNA transcript of the faulty gene, disrupting translation of the faulty mRNA, and therefore expression of the gene. A further strategy uses double stranded oligodeoxynucleotides as a decoy for the transcription factors that are required to activate the transcription of the <b>target</b> <b>gene.</b> The transcription factors bind to the decoys instead of the promoter of the faulty gene, which reduces the transcription of the <b>target</b> <b>gene,</b> lowering expression. Additionally, single stranded DNA oligonucleotides {{have been used to}} direct a single base change within a mutant gene. The oligonucleotide is designed to anneal with complementarity to the <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> {{with the exception of a}} central base, the target base, which serves as the template base for repair. This technique is referred to as oligonucleotide mediated <b>gene</b> repair, <b>targeted</b> <b>gene</b> repair, or <b>targeted</b> nucleotide alteration.|$|R
