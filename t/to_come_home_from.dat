[...] Kemper replied, [...] "No, good night!", before waiting for her to fall asleep and {{returning}} to bludgeon her with a claw hammer and slit her throat with a knife. He then decapitated her and engaged in irrumatio with her severed head before using it as a dart board; stating that he [...] "put [...] on a shelf and screamed at it for an hour... threw darts at it," [...] and ultimately, [...] "smashed her face in." [...] He also cut out her tongue and larynx {{and put them in the}} garbage disposal. However, the garbage disposal could not break down the tough vocal cords and ejected the tissue back into the sink. [...] "That seemed appropriate," [...] Kemper later said, [...] "as much as she'd bitched and screamed and yelled at me over so many years." [...] He then had sex with his mother's corpse, hid it in a closet and went out to drink. Upon his return, he invited his mother's best friend, 59-year-old Sara Taylor [...] "Sally" [...] Hallett, over to the house for dinner and a movie. When Hallett arrived, he strangled her to death, decapitated her and spent the night with her exanimate body. Kemper then stuffed her corpse in a closet, obscured any outward signs of a disturbance and left a note to the police reading: ...|$|E

50|$|The Ulysses {{syndrome}} (Immigrant Syndrome of Chronic and Multiple Stress) is an atypical set of depressive, anxious, dissociative and somatoform symptoms {{diagnosed in}} migrants facing {{a multitude of}} chronic, extreme stressors deriving from the difficulties of the migration process. The syndrome is named {{in relation to the}} ancient Greek hero, Odysseus (Ulysses is the Latin equivalent) who suffered involuntary migration and travelled for 10 years through the Mediterranean <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the decade-long Trojan War. The hardships of his journey are compared to the ones of contemporary migrants, who have to struggle with intensely stressful, novel situations in isolation and with little help. Scarcity of their resources makes it impossible to cope with and successfully adapt to unfamiliar environment of the receiving country, which in turn leads to experiencing a range of detrimental symptoms.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{stations}} {{that do not}} carry a newscast in the 6:00 p.m. timeslot in the Central Time Zone (commonly independent stations and most affiliates of non-historical networks like Fox - which has some {{stations that}} air a 6:00 p.m. newscast, though this is not entirely commonplace - The CW and MyNetworkTV) air situation comedies or other types of syndicated programming, such as reality series or game shows, during that hour. Many stations in the Central Time Zone tend to air one or both parts of the syndicated block at 5:00 p.m. or even earlier. Another more recent dilemma of the 7:00 p.m. primetime start is {{that a combination of}} longer commutes and work hours than in the past have caused many people <b>to</b> not <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> work until after 7:00 p.m., cutting into the potential ratings of shows that start at this time.

60|$|The {{matter in}} {{discussion}} was {{the chance of}} an order being sent out to Sir Marmaduke <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> his islands at the public expense, to give evidence, respecting colonial government in general, to a committee of the House of Commons which was about {{to sit on the}} subject. The committee had been voted, and two governors were to be brought home for the purpose of giving evidence. What arrangement could be so pleasant to a governor living in the Mandarin Islands, who had had a holiday lately, and who could but ill afford to take any holidays at his own expense? Colonel Osborne was on this committee, and, moreover, was on good terms at the Colonial Office. There were men in office who would be glad to do Colonel Osborne a service, and then if this were a job, it would be so very little of a job! Perhaps Sir Marmaduke might not be the very best man for the purpose. Perhaps the government of the Mandarins did not afford the best specimen of that colonial lore which it was the business of the committee to master. But then two governors were to come, and it might be as well to have one of the best sort, and one of the second best. No one supposed that excellent old Sir Marmaduke was a paragon of a governor, but then he had an infinity of experience! For over twenty years he had been from island to island, and had at least steered clear of great scrapes.|$|E

Dear mother, you write me, or Jeff must in the next letter, how you are getting along, whether it is any better or worse--I want to know. Mother, about George's fund in the bank; I hope by all means you can scratch along so as to leave $250 there--I am so anxious that our family should have a little ranch, even if it is the meanest kind, off somewhere that you can call your own, and that would do for Ed etc.--it might be a real dependence, and comfort--and may-be for George as much as any one. I mean to come home one of these days, and get the acre or half acre somewhere out in some by-place on Long Island, and build it--you see if I don't. About Hannah, dear mother, I hardly know what advice to give you--from what I know at present I can't tell what course to pursue.

Suppose in conversation, either under the {{influence}} of envy or ill will, or merely from love of talking, you make remarks and statements about another person which may be true or may not,--you do not stop to inquire,--your unguarded words set reports in motion, and unhappiness, and hard feeling, and loss of character are the result. You spoke idly, it is true, but nevertheless you are held responsible by God for all the consequences of your words. So professors of religion often make unguarded remarks about each other, which lead observers to doubt the truth of all religion; and they are responsible for every such doubt they excite. Parents and guardians often allow themselves to speak of the faults and weaknesses of their ministers in the presence of children and younger people--they do it thoughtlessly--but in so doing they destroy an influence which might otherwise have saved the souls of their children; they are responsible for it. People of cultivated minds and fastidious taste often allow themselves <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> church, and criticize a sermon, and unfold all its weak points in the presence of others on whom it may have made a very serious impression. While the critic is holding up the bad arrangement, and setting in a ludicrous point of view the lame figures, perhaps the servant behind his chair, who was almost persuaded to be a Christian by that very discourse, gives up his purposes, in losing his respect for the sermon; this was thoughtless--but the evil is done, and the man who did it is responsible for it." ...|$|E
30|$|The {{finding that}} 27 % had never managed an ectopic {{pregnancy}} laparoscopically has significant implications for evidence-based practice. The {{literature suggests that}} laparoscopy is better and more cost-effective than laparotomy in the surgical management of ectopic pregnancy [5], and the RCOG recommends its use in its guideline on ectopic pregnancy [9]. In a recent Welsh survey, 30 % of the respondents stated that ectopic pregnancy was managed laparoscopically only during routine hours in some trusts [10]. Such out-of-hours management of ectopic pregnancy further limits training and suggests that some consultants are either not trained or are reluctant <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in <b>from</b> <b>home</b> when on-call to do the procedure laparoscopically.|$|R

The results demonstrate that (a) 88 {{percent of the students}} walked directly to a residential dwelling: (b) 98 percent chose a least-distance path from their school to their residence or other destination: (c) the majority of students (62 percent), by choosing to minimize distance, found their route choices reduced to a single route option: 2 ̆ 7 and (d) when faced with the choice between two or more distance-minimizing routes, the children in this study selected structurally more complex routes than did adults. All the children in this study were among the first students to leave school after class and walked home unaccompanied. The children appear to follow the admonition <b>to</b> <b>come</b> straight <b>home</b> <b>from</b> school, but in so doing they are generally limited to a single shortest-distance option.
