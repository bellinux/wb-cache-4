5|$|Self-harm is not {{typically}} suicidal behaviour, although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that a self-inflicted injury {{may result in}} life-threatening damage. Although the person may not recognise the connection, self-harm often becomes a response to profound and overwhelming emotional pain that cannot be resolved in a more functional way.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} of being entertained {{has come to be}} strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.|$|E
5|$|Practicing correct sexual {{practices}} was one method of perfecting the body's internal spirits. The Celestial Masters believed that semen is {{the embodiment of}} qi. If someone ejaculated too often, their life would be shortened. In fact, the Xiang'er indicates that people should not even have sex {{for the purposes of}} reproduction. The Celestial Masters frowned upon the practice of heqi (also known as 'The Union of the Breaths') of not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain', and advocated non-ejaculation simply as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced. Despite their opposition to 'heqi' and reproductive sex, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that the Celestial Masters supported sex for purposes other than reproduction, and a Celestial Master text from around the 5th century describes an elaborate sexual ritual.See Kalinowski(1985) for a full description of the ritual.|$|E
25|$|The nation's largest {{hospitality}} workers' union, Unite, {{which represents}} 25% of hotel, restaurant and casino workers in New Zealand, demanded that workers share in windfall profits and said <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of a strike during the tournament.|$|R
50|$|A further {{fundamental}} issue {{was how to}} distribute the excess customs duties from the central government to the states. For <b>the</b> larger colonies <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> (which never became an actuality) {{that they could be}} required to subsidise the struggling economies of Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia.|$|R
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of a {{revitalisation}} of the Inner Circle in 1940, {{when the}} Ashworth Improvement Plan recommended a subway tunnel with five stations <b>be</b> built under <b>the</b> Melbourne CBD, from Flinders Street to the Inner Circle, with a proposed future subway {{from the first}} station to North Melbourne.|$|R
5|$|The games {{introduce}} Raikou, Entei, and Suicune, {{some new}} types of legendary Pokémon that wander around Johto, changing locations frequently. They can be tracked by the Pokédex once encountered, and will always attempt to flee, but will retain HP loss. In addition <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of encountering a shiny Pokémon, which have a different coloration than normal Pokémon of their species, and appear very rarely. Two new Pokémon types were added, the Steel-type and the Dark-type. Steel-type Pokémon are immune to Poison-type moves, and they have very high defense and resistance to other types, while Dark-type Pokémon are immune to Psychic-type moves and are strong against Psychic-type Pokémon, as well as having few weaknesses. In Gold and Silver, new moves were added, but Pokémon knowing these moves {{are not allowed to}} be traded to the first generation games. To solve this, a move deleter was introduced, capable of erasing moves known by the Pokémon. Another major change was the splitting of the Special stat into Special Attack and Special Defense, which increased aspects of strategy.|$|E
5|$|Fatty acids, or {{fatty acid}} {{residues}} {{when they are}} part of a lipid, are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain-elongation of an acetyl-CoA primer with malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA groups in a process called fatty acid synthesis. They are made of a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with a carboxylic acid group; this arrangement confers the molecule with a polar, hydrophilic end, and a nonpolar, hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water. The fatty acid structure is one of the most fundamental categories of biological lipids, and is commonly used as a building-block of more structurally complex lipids. The carbon chain, typically between four and 24 carbons long, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen, and sulfur. If a fatty acid contains a double bond, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of either a cis or trans geometric isomerism, which significantly affects the molecule's configuration. Cis-double bonds cause the fatty acid chain to bend, an effect that is compounded with more double bonds in the chain. Three double bonds in 18-carbon linolenic acid, the most abundant fatty-acyl chains of plant thylakoid membranes, render these membranes highly fluid despite environmental low-temperatures, and also makes linolenic acid give dominating sharp peaks in high resolution 13-C NMR spectra of chloroplasts. This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes. Most naturally occurring fatty acids are of the cis configuration, although the trans form does exist in some natural and partially hydrogenated fats and oils.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of innate {{differences}} between species, {{the variations in}} effects can largely be explained by how often and how heavily hosts are exposed.|$|E
25|$|The Visp-Zermatt-Bahn (VZ) {{transferred}} {{the management of}} the line to the Suisse Occidentale-Simplon, as under that arrangement <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of using its staff elsewhere during the annual winter service interruption. This management agreement <b>was</b> approved by <b>the</b> SOS's successor company, the Jura-Simplon-Bahn (JS) and retained finally also by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) until 1920.|$|R
50|$|However, due to {{the onslaught}} of Windisch-Grätz, {{he was forced to}} retire in December 1848 from Pest, and re-establish {{facilities}} in the east. Lahner planned an organized and professional evacuation and decommissioning of the plants so that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> to continue on the fight. On February 6, 1849 he <b>was</b> promoted to <b>the</b> rank of general.|$|R
50|$|If agreed, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> {{of playing}} at a handicap, e.g. Black two games out of three, if one player went far enough ahead. This could be {{reinforced}} to one player always taking Black, a handicap equivalent to two professional ranks, in extreme cases. For details see professional go handicaps. An uchikomi jūbango {{was one in}} which 'beating down' applied.|$|R
25|$|Go is “almost” in PSPACE, {{since in}} normal play, moves are not reversible, {{and it is}} only through capture that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of the repeating {{patterns}} necessary for a harder complexity.|$|E
25|$|Details for the Dakhamunzu/Zannanza affair {{are entirely}} from Hittite sources written {{many years after}} the events. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that Mursili is {{revising}} history to some extent, placing full responsibility for the fiasco on the Egyptians, leaving the details unreliable.|$|E
25|$|If {{that size}} is {{restricted}} to d, the problem of finding a minimum d-hitting set permits a d-approximation algorithm. Assuming the unique games conjecture, {{this is the best}} constant-factor algorithm that is possible and otherwise <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of improving the approximation to d1.|$|E
30|$|In the two {{articles}} by Atchison et al. <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> to identify patients {{as well as}} sample size was very restricted (six patients). <b>There</b> <b>was</b> no repetition of the questionnaire to test the variability between answers [4, 10]. When {{it comes to the}} validity and reliability of cephalometric analysis, several errors should be considered: landmark identification, tracing and measuring, and magnification of certain anatomical structures.|$|R
50|$|A coadjutor bishop is {{a bishop}} who is given almost equal {{authority}} {{to that of}} the diocesan bishop; he has special faculties and the right to succeed the incumbent diocesan bishop. The appointment of coadjutors is seen as a means of providing for continuity of church leadership. Until recent times, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of a coadjutor bishop not having the right of succession.|$|R
50|$|After Shell's {{purchase}} of Pennzoil, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that <b>the</b> remaining Pennzoil stations—mostly in western PA—would {{be converted to}} Shell {{as part of the}} company's aggressive movement to expand nationally. This hasn't happened, but the three company-owned Pennzoil gas stations in the New Castle, Pennsylvania area began co-branding themselves with 7-Eleven in 2003, with more emphasis placed on the 7-Eleven brand name than Pennzoil itself.|$|R
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of a {{rapid change}} in glaciers, ice sheets, and hence sea level. Predictions {{of such a}} change are highly {{uncertain}} due to insufficient scientific understanding. Modeling of the processes associated with a rapid ice-sheet and glacier change could potentially increase future projections of sea-level rise.|$|E
25|$|Steven Sugar died {{of cancer}} in January 2011, and it remains unclear what will happen with the legal battle. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of someone picking up the case on Mr. Sugar's behalf. The Supreme Court says it has listed the case {{provisionally}} for another hearing in Autumn 2011.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the atmospheric effects there are effects on the near-Earth space environment. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that orbit could become inaccessible for generations due to exponentially increasing space debris caused by spalling of satellites and vehicles (Kessler syndrome). Many launched vehicles today are therefore designed to be re-entered after use.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> No 7 <b>is</b> {{a variant}} of the No 6. Unlike the No 6, it has an inner and outer casing. The inner casing {{contained}} the explosive while the outer contained scrap that was intended to be used as shrapnel. Generally, <b>the</b> No 6 <b>was</b> used in preference to the No 7 as it <b>was</b> lighter and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of shrapnel from the No 7 hitting friendly soldiers.|$|R
40|$|Observations made {{in fourth}} grade {{classrooms}} in a neighborhood urban school after {{the implementation of the}} Ohio Proficiency test (OPT) demonstrated the loss of one schools exemplary inclusion models. In addition, identified special education students may have <b>been</b> harmed and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that <b>the</b> misplacement of some students occurred. Literature warns of <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that high stakes tests, like the OPT may increase the number of identified special education students...|$|R
50|$|Also called rappelling, {{abseiling}} uses a fixed rope to descend. This {{technique is}} not only used to go down after a climb, {{it can also be}} used when trying new climbing routes and when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a seemingly difficult access to the start of a climb. Careful execution is important when abseiling. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> of jammed ropes, ropes becoming severed after getting in contact with sharp edges, and other cases of equipment failure.|$|R
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of a subcategorization {{depending}} of {{the main}} style upon which the chalet is based. In fact, Alberto Córsico Piccolini used to characterize some of his works as normando simplificado ("simplified Norman") when the basic design of the houses displays some features of the Norman architecture at domestic scale.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> {{that the}} {{practices}} of psychiatric care might {{make a contribution to}} illness. Psychiatry and its underpinning science remain heirs to a chequered past and are certainly no less guilty than the other sciences in promoting dogma as fact, only to later see it supplanted by a contrary view.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the debt}} is still legally valid, and the {{creditor}} can attempt {{to collect the}} full amount for the time periods permitted under state law, which is usually three to seven years. This includes contacts from internal collections staff, or more likely, an outside collection agency. If the amount is large (generally over $1,500–2,000), <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of a lawsuit or arbitration.|$|E
50|$|Due to its rapidly aging {{population}} and its geographic isolation from Niihama {{and the main}} island of Shikoku, Nii Ōshima faces serious problems of depopulation. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> a ferry that runs between Nii Ōshima and Niihama approximately once every hour, taking fifteen minutes to complete a one-way journey. At one point <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that a bridge might be built to connect Ōshima and Shikoku, but these plans are now considered unlikely.|$|R
50|$|Although most of <b>the</b> {{arterial}} <b>was</b> {{proposed as}} an at-grade highway, the interchange with Route 169 would not <b>be</b> so <b>the</b> highway can <b>be</b> safe through <b>the</b> Greenville Railroad Yard on a viaduct. The right-of-way {{for the new}} Liberty Harbor arterial would be 110 ft wide and terminate at Interchange 14B, although <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of turning it into the new Hudson River Route, a project being studied by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.|$|R
25|$|Later studies {{suggested}} {{that it was possible}} for multiple primitive forms of the dog to have existed, including in Europe. European dog populations had undergone extensive turnover during the last 15,000 years that has erased the genomic signature of early European dogs, the genetic heritage of the modern breeds has become blurred due to admixture, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of past domestication events that had gone extinct or had been largely replaced by more modern dog populations.|$|R
25|$|O'Hare {{has four}} {{numbered}} passenger terminals with nine lettered concourses {{and a total}} of 182 gates. Two or more additional terminal buildings are envisioned; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of a large terminal complex for {{the west side of the}} field, with access from I-90 and/or the Elgin-O'Hare Expressway, if the runway reconfiguration is completed and passenger numbers require additional terminals.|$|E
25|$|In stage 1c and 2 cancers, {{radiation}} therapy is used after surgery if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of residual {{disease in the}} pelvis but the abdomen is cancer-free. Radiotherapy {{can also be used}} in palliative care of advanced cancers. A typical course of radiotherapy for ovarian cancer is 5 days a week for 3–4 weeks. Common side effects of radiotherapy include diarrhea, constipation, and frequent urination.|$|E
25|$|The Cheshire Red Reports concern {{a vampire}} thief called Raylene Pendle. Although she prefers to work alone, she acquires {{a group of}} misfits who join her in her adventures. These are two young children, a blind vampire and an ex-Navy Seal/Drag Queen. Bloodshot also {{features}} the world of urban exploration. The Cheshire Red reports were originally only commissioned as a two book series. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of a third book in this series provisionally entitled Sawbones if sufficient interest is expressed.|$|E

25|$|In this environment, Ross led a {{delegation}} to Washington in March 1834 {{to try to}} negotiate alternatives to removal. Ross made several proposals; however, the Cherokee Nation may not have approved any of Ross's plans, nor <b>was</b> <b>there</b> reasonable expectation that Jackson would settle for any agreement short of removal. These offers, coupled with the lengthy cross-continental trip, indicated that Ross's strategy was to prolong negotiations on removal indefinitely. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that <b>the</b> next President might be more favorably inclined.|$|R
