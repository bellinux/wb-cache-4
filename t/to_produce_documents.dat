These can include the subpoena duces tecum <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>documents,</b> {{or in some cases}} to undergo a physical or mental examination. In the Ninth Circuit, interpreting Rule 27 literally, it has been held that a party can simply produce the documents only, and in certain cases, avoid an oral deposition when presented with subpoena duces tecum.|$|E

On March 13, 2003, Pearlman was declared in contempt of court for ignoring a court order <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>documents</b> relating to royalty payments. He had also dated Lindsay Lohan along with his girlfriend Hilary Duff at the same time (leading to a feud between the two), but he broke up with Lohan in April 2003, and resumed dating Duff.

2500|$|In {{the video}} {{recorded}} {{shortly after the}} shooting, Reynolds said that the car was pulled over for a broken taillight. Yanez' attorney Kelly stated following the shooting that his client stopped Castile {{in part because he}} resembled a suspect in an armed robbery that had taken place nearby four days earlier, and in part because of a broken taillight. A Castile family attorney, Albert Goins, questioned this account, said that if Yanez actually thought Castile was a robbery suspect, the police would have made a [...] "felony traffic stop" [...] (involving [...] "bringing the suspect out at gunpoint while officers are in a position of cover and having them lie on the ground until they can identify who that individual is") rather than an ordinary traffic stop (in which officers stop the car and ask the driver <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>documents).</b> Goins said, [...] "Either [...] was a robbery suspect and [...] didn't follow the procedures for a felony stop, or [...] was not a robbery suspect and [...] shot a man because he stood at his window getting his information." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a {{particularly}} controversial development, the Russian news agency Interfax reported that Gamsakhurdia had {{agreed with the}} Soviet military that the Georgian National Guard would be disarmed and on August 23 he issued decrees abolishing the post of commander of the Georgian National Guard and redesignating its members as interior troops subordinate to the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs. In reality, the National Guard was already {{a part of the}} Ministry of the Interior, and Gamsakhurdia's opponents, who claimed he was seeking to abolish it, were asked <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>documents</b> they claimed they possessed which verified their claims, but did not do so. Gamsakhurdia always maintained {{he had no intention of}} disbanding the National Guard. In defiance of the alleged order of Gamskhurdia, the sacked National Guard commander Tengiz Kitovani led most of his troops out of Tbilisi on August 24. By this time, however, the coup had clearly failed and Gamsakhurdia publicly congratulated Russia's President Boris Yeltsin on his victory over the putschists (Russian Journal [...] "Russki Curier", Paris, September 1991). Georgia had survived the coup without any violence, but Gamsakhurdia's opponents accused him of not being resolute in opposing it.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{a notice}} {{to a party}} {{deponent}} (a person called to testify in a deposition) may {{be accompanied by a}} request for production of documents and other tangible things during the taking of a deposition. The notice to produce (literally: [...] "bring these documents with you to the deposition") is served prior to the deposition. This follows the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The method of using a subpoena duces tecum is generally valid only to compel a witness <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>documents</b> and other things {{at the time of the}} deposition. If a deponent is a non-party to the action (not involved directly in the litigation, but wanted for testimony), production of documents can be compelled only through a proper subpoena duces tecum. Depending on the nature of the documents, and their volume, some may be obtained directly, and before deposition under FRCP 34. In cases where a large number of documents are potentially relevant to the hearing, the court may order them to be produced prior to the deposition. This forms a part of legal discovery and allows parties involved time to review them prior to the deposition or other hearing.|$|E
2500|$|In August {{the matter}} become public when Liddell Hart {{launched}} a press campaign {{to have the}} four officers released. He was supported by figures such as Michael Foot, Victor Gollancz and Lord De L'Isle, VC. On 27 August the government responded by formally announcing that the four would be tried by a British military court in Hamburg. Items in Rundstedt's indictment included: [...] "the maltreatment and killing of civilians and prisoners of war... killing hostages, illegal employment of prisoners of war, deportation of forced labour to Germany... mass execution of Jews... and other war crimes, yet to be specified." [...] On 24 September the four were moved to a military hospital in Hamburg, where {{they were allowed to}} be visited by their families. It was here that Brauchitsch died suddenly of heart failure on 18 October. This led to a renewed outcry in Britain for the trial to be abandoned. Nevertheless, Bevin was determined to press ahead, and on 1 January 1949 Rundstedt, Manstein and Strauss were formally charged. Hugo Laternser was engaged as Rundstedt's counsel, and Liddell Hart and others in Britain collected material for the defence. The Bishop of Chichester, George Bell, announced that he would bring in a motion in the House of Lords critical of the government. This was a serious threat since the Lords had the power to compel the government <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>documents.</b>|$|E
