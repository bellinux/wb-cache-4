500|$|The team hosted {{an event}} to honor wounded {{veterans}} of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom at Heinz Field. Players signed autographs and held on-field drills with the veterans, while soldiers and Marines spoke of their experiences. Chris Hoke, {{who attended the}} event said, [...] "These {{are the people who}} fight for us to have our freedom and be who we are as Americans. <b>To</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> and spend a couple hours with them and hear their stories is unbelievable. There's nothing better than this." ...|$|E
2500|$|We're {{being taken}} {{for the biggest}} ride I can {{remember}} – the umpiring, the crowd and Charlie. I promise I won't say anything to anybody, but it is downright cheating...this isn't England vs the West Indies...Some of the remarks from the crowd are too awful, shouting [...] "kill" [...] at us. I must be bloody mad <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Popcorn Pictures {{gave the}} film {{two and a}} half stars out of four, writing: [...] "Screamers isn't terrible. The scenes inside the {{refinery}} are creepy enough with them stalking and being stalked by the Screamers. But the intro and finale are terrible ways to start and end a film respectively. There was a good film waiting <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> it's a shame only half of it did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're getting frightfully modern," [...] she remarked, {{turning and}} waiting for him. [...] "Mrs. Handsell and I ought <b>to</b> have <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> and you and uncle ought to have stayed and yawned at one another over the dinner-table." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon not," [...] replied Slone. [...] "I'm afraid I've {{done wrong}} <b>to</b> let you <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here....</b> But I never thought. I'm {{not used to}} girls. I'll--I'll deserve what I get for lettin' you came." ...|$|R
5000|$|Carl Edwards {{scored the}} pole {{for the race}} {{with a time of}} 28.119 and a speed of 135.453 mph. He said {{afterwards}} that his team [...] "just give me fast race cars. We worked in qualifying trim most of our first practice this weekend and now we have to translate that speed to a good race set-up for Sunday. We’d like <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of <b>here</b> with the trophy and make our way to the next round of the Chase.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{ought to}} be lonely enough to suit anybody," [...] {{observed}} Henshaw. He turned to Roger. [...] "How would you like <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> some dark night all alone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a girl. I {{never saw}} her, {{as she was}} born after I left home. My wife wasn't very well when she wrote last. She wants <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> but I can't see that yet a while." ...|$|E
6000|$|Very {{early in}} the morning Captain Burke was aroused by the {{entrance}} of the sailing-master, Mr. Portman, into his state-room. [...] "'Morning, sir," [...] said Mr. Portman. [...] "I want you <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> and look at something!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope so. It was an ineffable comfort <b>to</b> me <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> <b>out</b> of Littleworthy croquet, and I think cheering me did him good. Rachel, you may do and {{say what}} you please," [...] he added, earnestly, [...] "since you have taken to him." ...|$|R
5000|$|The 2010s {{were marked}} by three {{consecutive}} Academy Award nominations for Quebecois films in the Foreign Language category, namely for Incendies (2010), Monsieur Lazhar (2011) and War Witch (2012). War Witch director Kim Nguyen proclaimed [...] "People {{around the world are}} looking at Quebec cinema now and waiting for the next director <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of <b>here.</b> This has a tremendous impact on a country’s recognition outside of its borders." [...] University of Berlin film scholar Claudia Kotte wrote Incendies, Monsieur Lazhar, Inch'Allah (2012) and War Witch, represent a break from focus on local history to more global concerns.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Then {{there must}} be some evil spirit there,' said Skafti, 'when men are less willing to herd your sheep, than those of others. Now since you have asked my advice, I will get a {{shepherd}} for you. Glam is his name, he belongs <b>to</b> Sweden, and <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> last summer. He is big and strong, but not very well liked by most people.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But even then," [...] the {{vice-consul}} concluded, [...] "I don't see why {{she wanted}} this man <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here.</b> The only {{explanation is that}} she was a little off her base towards the last. That's the charitable supposition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I oughtn't to {{tell you}} such {{nonsense}} as that; {{and then he said}} that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> and see you, and--and--and--; it is simply this, that he meant to ask you to be his sweetheart, if I would let him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do you do, La Fleur," [...] said Miss Panney. [...] "I {{am glad to}} see you. I {{suppose you}} still keep up your old {{interest}} in Mrs. Drane and her daughter. Do you often find time <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> to see them?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The Nationals' {{marketing}} slogan for {{the season}} was [...] "Let Yourself Go." [...] Nationals Vice President of Sales and Marketing David Cope explained that the slogan told [...] "people <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the game, <b>to</b> let themselves <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium. But then once you're here, have fun, let loose. We don't want it to feel like stuffy old D.C. -- and it doesn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What'd {{you want}} <b>to</b> let her <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> for?" [...] demanded Lawson, hotly. [...] "It {{was a dead}} mistake. I've lost my head over her. I'll have her or die. Don't you think if she was my wife I'd soon pull myself together? Since she came we've none of us been right. And the gang has put up a holler. No, Longstreth, we've got to settle things to-night." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} Canada's {{entry in the}} Best Foreign Language Film {{category}} at the 85th Academy Awards. It was a rare Canadian submission for featuring {{a substantial amount of}} Lingala as well as French. It was among nine shortlisted in December 2012, and became one of the five nominees. Mwanza received a visa to allow her to attend the Academy Awards. It was the third consecutive Quebec film nominated, following Incendies and Monsieur Lazhar, with Nguyen proclaiming [...] "People around the world are looking at Quebec cinema now and waiting for the next director <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of <b>here.</b> This has a tremendous impact on a country’s recognition outside of its borders." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A good bit, lad. You see, many used <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> just {{to shoot}} {{for the sake}} of killing. I've known a party of six men to kill twenty or thirty buffalo and then leave the {{carcasses}} to the wolves. That was a shame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} long to me too! Oh, so long! so long! I have asked you <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> because I {{wanted to see}} you so much that I could not wait any longer. I have been heart-hungry for a sight of you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go {{and tell}} Annie <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> to me, {{and then go}} for Doctor Haddon at once," [...] {{she said to the}} odd-job man so soon as he brought the water; and added, seeing he hesitated, [...] "I will {{tell you all about it}} when you come back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mouse dear," [...] she said, hesitatingly, [...] "the {{reason why}} I wanted <b>to</b> have you <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> why I couldn't sleep, I {{wanted to tell}} you how ashamed I am for having been peevish, being petulant, last night. I'm so sorry, because you were very patient with me, you were very good to me. I don't want you to think of me just as a crochety woman who didn't {{appreciate}} you. You are very kind, and when I hear that you're married to some nice girl I'll be as happy as can be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why don't {{you leave}} her alone? A little wizened monkey like that!" [...] It was thus that Madame Socani {{expressed}} her opinion of her rival. [...] "A creature without {{an ounce of}} flesh on her bones. Her voice won't last long. It never does with those little mean made apes. There was Grisi and Tietjens,--they had something of a body for a voice <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of. And <b>here</b> is this girl that you think so much of, taking money hand over hand {{from the very first}} lord she comes across." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Euphemia, [...] "Mr. Ball says it's all right, if we {{keep the}} fence up. He don't want his cows {{to get into the}} creek, and I'm sure we don't want 'em walking over us. He couldn't understand, though, why we wanted to live <b>out</b> <b>here.</b> I {{explained}} the whole thing to him very carefully, but it didn't seem to make much impression on him. I believe he thinks Pomona has something the matter with her, and that we have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> stay <b>out</b> <b>here</b> in the fresh air so as not to take it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, do! he frets {{her like}} a mosquito. She forbade him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> while she stayed, and packed him off with Demi. I like old Tom, {{but he is a}} regular noodle about Nan,' added Rob, as he went away to help his father with the {{accumulated}} letters.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait a minute, aunt Dorcas; I want to {{tell you}} something," [...] and Joe laid his hand on the little woman's arm to prevent her from rising. [...] "You never knew why Plums an' I left New York <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> where there isn't a chance to earn a living." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{not easy}} to say, Billie," [...] {{answered}} the girl, with another pleasant little laugh, [...] "but it is so funny that a sailor should take such a fancy <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> so far away from his native element, and find so much interest in snow-shoe walking and Indian customs." ...|$|E
60|$|And after breakfast--away {{from the}} haunts of men! Away from the bickerings, the {{subjection}} of mean spirits; material loss and gain and material passion! By eight o'clock (the Widow Peasley's household being an early and orderly one) he was swinging across the long hills, cleaving for himself a furrowed {{path in the}} untrodden snow, breathing deep as he gazed across the blue spaces from the crests. Bellerophon or Perseus, aided by immortals, felt no greater sense of achievements <b>to</b> <b>come</b> than he. <b>Out</b> <b>here,</b> on the wind-swept hills that rolled onward and upward to the mountains, the world was his.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell her, too," [...] {{she went}} on earnestly, [...] "that I feel {{she is one of}} us; still a Huguenot, a Frenchwoman, and one of our race, or she would never have allowed her only son <b>to</b> <b>come</b> over, <b>to</b> risk his life in our cause. I {{consider}} her a heroine, Marie. It is all very well for me, whose religion is endangered, whose friends are in peril, whose people are persecuted, to throw myself into the strife and to send Francois into the battle; but with her, working there with an invalid husband, and her heart, as it must be, wrapped up in her boy, it is splendid <b>to</b> let him <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> <b>to</b> fight side by side with us for the faith. Whose idea was it first?" ...|$|R
50|$|S: They'll <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> {{looking like}} they're on stilts.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I don’t {{think you}} will,’ replied Chevenix. ‘When I agreed <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> and do sentry-go, {{it was on}} one condition, Master Ronald: don’t you forget that! Military discipline, my boy! Our beat is this path close about the house. Down, Towzer! good boy, good boy—gently, then!’ he went on, caressing his confounded monster.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess that's about so. If a man's got anything, on his mind, a big {{railroad}} depot's {{the place}} for him. But you're run down. You ought <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> and take a hand, and be a man amongst men." [...] Kinney talked partly for quantity, and partly for pure, indefinite good feeling.|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him {{steadily}} for a moment, and then answered, speaking very quietly. [...] "I found that Mr. Lancaster had arrived in town, and had gone to your house, {{and that he was}} in such a hurry that he walked. So I immediately hired a buggy <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here.</b> I am very glad I met you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hillo, sir! <b>Come</b> <b>out!</b> <b>Here</b> {{are your}} betters here before you," [...] {{as he sees}} Stangrave, and a fat old lady in the {{opposite}} corner.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose you}} <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> yourself. Miss Tita {{must have had}} to lend you a hand," [...] I {{interposed}} with a pacifying intention.|$|R
60|$|CAPT. G. I <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> and {{the whole}} thing went phut. She wrote to say {{that there had been a}} mistake, and then she married.|$|R
