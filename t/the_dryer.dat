5|$|The {{dominant}} {{factor in}} nesting mortality is starvation. Sibling rivalry can be intense, and in South Africa {{third and fourth}} chicks inevitably starve. In <b>the</b> <b>dryer</b> habitats with fewer amphibians the diet may lack sufficient vertebrate content and may cause bone abnormalities in growing chicks due to calcium deficiency. In Barbados, nests were sometimes raided by vervet monkeys, and a study in Florida reported the fish crow and black rat as other possible nest raiders. The same study attributed some nestling mortality to brown pelicans nesting in the vicinity, which accidentally, but frequently, dislodged nests or caused nestlings to fall. In Australia, Torresian crows, wedge-tailed eagles and white-bellied sea eagles take eggs or young, and tick infestation and viral infections may also be causes of mortality.|$|E
5|$|The park's woods are {{important}} because they provide shelter for {{a large number of}} animals. They are a natural defence against landslides, avalanches, and flooding. The two main types of woods found in the park are coniferous and deciduous woods. The deciduous European beech forests are common on the Piedmont side of the park, and are not found on <b>the</b> <b>dryer</b> Valle d'Aosta side. These forests are thick with dense foliage that lets in very little light during the summer. The beech leaves {{take a long time to}} decompose, and they form a thick layer on the woodland floor that impedes the development of other plants and trees. Larches are the most common trees in the forests on the valley floors. They are mixed with spruces, Swiss stone pines, and more rarely silver firs.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} establish the effect of the biomass-heated natural convection dryer on insect damage, mould infection, aflatoxin contamination and the germination potential of maize grain during storage. Maize grains were dried using two methods; on bare ground simulating farmer practices and using <b>the</b> biomass <b>dryer.</b> <b>The</b> maize dried on bare ground took five days to dry to safe storage moisture content of 14 % while that of <b>the</b> biomass <b>dryer</b> took only 6 h. Drying maize grain using <b>the</b> biomass <b>dryer</b> delayed insect infestation by three months and significantly (p≤ 0. 05) reduced mould and aflatoxin contamination during storage for 6 months. Maize dried using <b>the</b> biomass <b>dryer</b> was only infested with Angoumois grain moth (Sitotroga cerealella) while that dried on bare ground was infested by both the moth and the maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) implying that <b>the</b> biomass <b>dryer</b> controlled <b>the</b> most important storage insect pest of maize in Uganda. Drying maize using <b>the</b> biomass <b>dryer</b> had no effect on the germination potential of the grain. Thus, drying maize grain with <b>the</b> biomass <b>dryer</b> reduces drying time and greatly improves the quality of the grain during storage. However, the subsequent storage quality of the grain highly depends on the storage form (shelled or unshelled), time and environment...|$|R

40|$|Energy usage is {{indispensible}} inhuman {{development and}} a major determination factor in technological development. However, artificial energy supply is generally low and scarce in rural areas of Nigeria. Hence, this work is aimed at performance evaluation of commonly available solar thermal energy collector materials in Zaria, Nigeria, and to identify the most appropriate solar thermal energy collector material to enhance useful energy availability to rural dwellers. Commonly available local materials, such as wood, cement, mud and metal were each employed to fabricate a solar dryer. Thermal energy generation of <b>the</b> <b>dryers</b> were monitored and sliced tomato was utilized to test-run <b>the</b> <b>dryers,</b> while open sun drying was used as control.

50|$|Thermal drying {{is usually}} used for fine {{particles}} and to remove low water {{content in the}} particles.

50|$|In modern models, {{a survey}} of stores in 2007 showed that most hair dryers have ceramic heating {{elements}} (like ceramic heaters)—because of their “instant heat” capability.

Paper manufacturing is an example in which over 90 % of the water from pulp is sequentially removed through gravity, vacuum dewatering, pressing, and thermal drying.

25|$|Inside <b>the</b> <b>dryer,</b> hot dry air {{is pumped}} {{into the bottom of}} the hopper {{containing}} the resin so that it flows up through the pellets, removing moisture on its way. The hot wet air leaves the top of the hopper and is first run through an after-cooler, because it is easier to remove moisture from cold air than hot air. The resulting cool wet air is then passed through a desiccant bed. Finally, the cool dry air leaving the desiccant bed is re-heated in a process heater and sent back through the same processes in a closed loop. Typically, residual moisture levels in the resin must be less than 50 parts per million (parts of water per million parts of resin, by weight) before processing. Dryer residence time should not be shorter than about four hours. This is because drying the material in less than 4 hours would require a temperature above 160°C, at which level hydrolysis would begin inside the pellets before they could be dried out.|$|E

30|$|High-efficiency (HE) washers use 35 – 50 % {{less water}} and about 50 % less energy per load than {{conventional}} washers.

Consumers need research-based information that would help them make informed decisions concerning the purchase of a clothes washer. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare fabric hand, appearance retention (strain removal, color change, and fabric smoothness), and dimension stability (dimensional change and skewness change) after the specimens were repeatedly washed and dried for up to 20 cycles in three combinations of washer and dryer used: (a) conventional washer and dryer, (b) HE washer and conventional dryer, and (c) HE washer and <b>dryer.</b> <b>The</b> results showed that the specimens washed in the HE washer had better fabric hand and were smoother (fewer wrinkles) than those washed in the conventional washer.

Though no toxins were found in his blood, a lack of evidence of struggle led investigators to suspect Wone had been injected with a paralytic agent.
