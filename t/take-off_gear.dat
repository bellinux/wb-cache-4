25|$|Also {{known as}} the Reaper, it was a F.8 {{modified}} by Gloster as a private venture ground attack fighter. The modification allowed the carriage of external Rocket-Assisted <b>Take-Off</b> <b>Gear</b> (RATOG), added a 57mm cannon in the lower fuselage and tip tanks. First flown 4 September 1950, only one was built.|$|E
25|$|The F 1 had {{a maximum}} speed of 599mph (964km/h) {{at sea level}} {{and a range of}} 800mi (1,287km) on {{internal}} fuel. A more refined fighter variant was the F 2, which introduced power-boosted aileron controls as well as other modifications, including to its structure. The next variant of the Sea Hawk was developed into a fighter-bomber, the FB 3, and differed only slightly from its predecessors; its structure being strengthened to allow it to carry a wider array of equipment and weaponry on its four hard points, these included rockets, bombs, napalm, mines, reconnaissance cameras, external drop tanks and fixtures for rocket-assisted <b>take-off</b> <b>gear</b> (RATOG).|$|E
25|$|The B6N1's Mamori 11 {{engine was}} found prone to severe {{vibrations}} and overheating at certain speeds {{and was at}} first judged too unreliable (an important consideration given that the plane was expected to fly long distances over open water). Following a series of modifications, though, the engine's performance was finally deemed promising enough that carrier acceptance trials were begun {{at the end of}} 1942. Subsequent test flights conducted aboard the carriers Ryuho and Zuikaku indicated the need to strengthen the tail hook mounting on the plane's fuselage. Some attempts were also made to use RATOG (rocket-assisted <b>take-off</b> <b>gear)</b> units on several B6N1s in order to qualify the aircraft for use on smaller carriers but the results were unsatisfactory.|$|E
50|$|Ar 234 V1 to V5: Initial prototypes of the Ar 234A with skid landing <b>gear,</b> <b>take-off</b> {{tricycle}} <b>gear</b> trolley with trio of retractable landing skids, and 2 x Jumo 004 engines.|$|R
5000|$|On 31 July 1978, a Fairchild Hiller FH-227 {{impacted}} {{the runway}} of Chub Cay International Airport seconds after <b>take-off</b> with its <b>gear</b> already retracted. It skidded {{on the runway}} {{and came to a}} halt, but was damaged beyond repair. There were no fatalities.|$|R
50|$|Some {{commercial}} applications use non-synchronized manual transmissions {{that require}} a skilled operator. Depending on the country, many local, regional, and national laws govern operation {{of these types of}} vehicles (see Commercial Driver's License). This class may include commercial, military, agricultural, or engineering vehicles. Some of these may use combinations of types for multi-purpose functions. An example is a power <b>take-off</b> (PTO) <b>gear.</b> The non-synchronous transmission type requires an understanding of gear range, torque, engine power, and multi-functional clutch and shifter functions. Also see Double-clutching, and Clutch-brake sections of the main article. Float shifting is the process of shifting gears without using the clutch.|$|R
2500|$|Taihos {{original}} design specified installation of two catapults on her forward bow for power-assisted take-offs. However, as the Imperial Japanese Navy had not developed a workable catapult for carrier decks {{by the time}} of Taihos construction, these were eventually deleted from the requirements. The IJN instead opted to use rocket-assisted <b>take-off</b> <b>gear</b> (RATOG) when necessary. This consisted of two solid-propellant (cordite) rockets attached to either side of a plane's fuselage. Generating [...] of thrust for three seconds, {{they were able to get}} an aircraft airborne in a much shorter distance than normally required.|$|E
2500|$|The only {{aircraft}} types to {{be flown}} operationally from MACs were the Fairey Swordfish Mks. II and III. [...] The flight deck {{was not much}} wider than the Swordfish wing span, and a Swordfish fully loaded with rockets and depth charges might require rocket-assisted <b>take-off</b> <b>gear</b> (RATOG) to launch in unfavorable wind conditions. The normal complement of aircraft was four on grain ships and three on tankers. [...] The tankers were capable of routinely carrying four aircraft and the Dutch MACs Gadila and Macoma did so {{on a number of}} occasions, while the only report of four aircraft on board a British tanker related to an emergency diversion. [...] A trial landing of a Martlet fighter was made onto Amastra in October 1943 while the use of MACs in the Pacific was being briefly considered.|$|E
2500|$|On 17 October 1949, {{the third}} prototype, VP422, made its maiden flight. Being {{representative}} of the subsequent production aircraft, VP422 incorporated a number of modifications {{as a result of}} the experiences gained from trials with the second prototype, these alterations included the fitting of a longer arrester hook when a number of [...] "bolters" [...] were experienced during the early dummy deck trials. After the longer hook was incorporated, this modification was carried though the remaining production runs. Other changes included the addition of fixtures for rocket-assisted <b>take-off</b> <b>gear</b> (RATOG) and hard points plumbed for external drop tanks. On 22 November 1949, Hawker received an initial production contract for 151 aircraft, the aircraft also received the name Sea Hawk at this point. Throughout 1950, both VP413 and VP422 were used to conduct preliminary service trials.|$|E
50|$|Early powered {{versions}} consisted simply of a motor {{added to}} the foot-launched hang glider version with control {{by a combination of}} weight shift for pitch and tip rudders for roll and yaw, with the tip rudders used together as air brakes. Because many pilots could not run fast enough to achieve <b>take-off</b> wheeled tricycle <b>gear</b> was added. The aircraft exhibited poor pitch stability so a horizontal stabilizer and elevator was added. Finally on later versions the tip rudders were replaced with a tail-mounted rudder.|$|R
2500|$|As completed, Vikramaditya has {{a larger}} full load {{displacement}} {{than when the}} ship was originally launched in 1982 as Baku. 1,750 out of 2,500 compartments of the ship were re-fabricated, and extensive re-cabling was done to support new radars and sensors. The elevators were upgraded, and two restraining stands were fitted, allowing combat aircraft to reach full power before making a ski jump-assisted short <b>take-off.</b> Three arresting <b>gears</b> were fitted on the aft part of the angled deck, and navigation and carrier-landing aids were added to support fixed-wing [...] "short take-off but arrested recovery" [...] (STOBAR) operations.|$|R
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war, German rocket technology was studied extensively by various members of the former Allied nations. Britain had quickly opted to commence a programme to develop liquid-propellant rockets with the aim of boosting aircraft during the take-off phase, known within the RAF as rocket-assisted <b>take-off</b> <b>gear</b> (RATOG), and during the climb-to-altitude phase of flight. In 1946, work began on a pair of new British-built rocket motors, the de Havilland Sprite (5,000lb thrust) and the Armstrong Siddeley Snarler (2,000lb thrust); these rocket motors made use of different propellants, the Sprite used a high-test peroxide (HTP) monopropellant while the Snarler harnessed a methanol/water/liquid oxygen mix. During the early 1950s, both engines proceeded to the flight testing phase; however, some of the demand for their role to provide fighters with increased performance was soon being met by the increasing prevalence of [...] conventional jet engines being equipped with reheat instead.|$|E
5000|$|PB2Y-3s {{converted}} {{with four}} [...] Pratt & Whitney R-1830-92 Twin Wasp engines, increased fuel capacity and provision for RATOG (rocket assisted <b>take-off</b> <b>gear).</b>|$|E

50|$|JATO (acronym for jet-{{assisted}} take-off), {{is a type}} of {{assisted take-off}} for helping overloaded aircraft into the air by providing additional thrust in the form of small rockets. The term JATO is used interchangeably with the (more specific) term RATO, for rocket-assisted take-off (or, in RAF parlance, RATOG for rocket-assisted <b>take-off</b> <b>gear).</b>|$|E
