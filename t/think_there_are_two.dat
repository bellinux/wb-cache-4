60|$|It {{is evident}} the mind knows not things immediately, {{but only by}} the {{intervention}} of the ideas it has of them.

How shall the mind, when it perceives nothing but its own ideas, know that they agree with things themselves?

Then I went indoors to write a few business letters which, since I had become immersed in the affairs of that unlucky gold mine, had grown to be almost a daily task with me. I had got through several with many groanings, for none were agreeable in their tenor, when Hans poked his head through the window in a silent kind of a way as a big snake might do, and said: [...] "Baas, I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> baases out on the road there who are looking for you.

50|$|Though, {{one might}} call them “Essene”, one must take the {{definition}} for this from what the Scrolls themselves say, not necessarily what others think or say the Essenes were. Hippolytus, for instance, possibly preserving an alternate version of Josephus, <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> or even three groups of “Essenes”, “Zealot” or “Sicarii Essenes”, and for Eisenman, this is a better definition of what the Essenes were than the more normative ones people are familiar with. For him the Essenes are what Christians were in Palestine before ‘the Movement’ went overseas and was Paulinized, turning it into the mirror opposite {{of what it was}} in Palestine before the fall of the Temple.|$|R

The second is, that it was formed and grew up among ourselves; that it is in every respect peculiar to this island; and that, if the Roman or any foreign laws attempted to intrude into its composition, it has always had vigor enough to shake them off, and return to the purity of its primitive constitution.|$|R

50|$|The German {{composer}} Richard Wagner was {{a controversial}} figure during his lifetime, and {{has continued to}} be so after his death.

One is conscious [...] [...] [...] But the other is unconscious; on some occasions it controls a person completely without his knowledge, sometimes even against his will'.

All the while Head describes everything in plural, i.e. [...] "Rottingdeans", [...] "main roads near Pirbrights" [...] (in the movie And Now for Something Completely Different the other route is mentioned, starting in Manchesters and going down through Oxfords, Londons and Purleys to Dovers, {{and from there to}} Nairobis and so on).

5000|$|Regarding the album's lyrical and {{thematic}} content, Jason Lytle noted, [...] "I {{think if}} anything, {{some of the}} elements that used to drive {{a lot of my}} favourite Grandaddy songs home, was this whole storytelling aspect. Creating these little worlds and creating sounds and creating lines where you almost have to create your own little image to go with what you're hearing. ... I had this recurring image throughout the album, and I don't know where this came from. It's this recurring image, of some sort of tragedy. It's a woman, stranded, up high, in a blizzard, among the rocks and a guy who is down in the valley who can't do anything about it and its this distress of him knowing he can't do anything about it. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> or three songs, where that imagery pops up." ...|$|E
50|$|The most {{probable}} {{solution of}} the difficulty is that proposed by Friedrich Thiersch, who <b>thinks</b> that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> artists of this name: one an Argive, the instructor of Phidias, born about 540 BC; the other a native of Sicyon, who flourished at the date assigned by Pliny and was confused by the scholiast on Aristophanes with his more illustrious Argive namesake. Thiersch supports this hypothesis by an able criticism of a passage of Pausanias.|$|R

What happiness (I thought) if we were married, and were going away anywhere to live among the trees and in the fields, never growing older, never growing wiser, children ever, rambling hand in hand through sunshine and among flowery meadows, laying down our heads on moss at night, in a sweet sleep of purity and peace, and buried by the birds when we were dead!
