50|$|The solar humidification-dehumidification (HDH) process (also {{called the}} multiple-effect humidification-dehumidification process, solar {{multistage}} condensation evaporation cycle (SMCEC) or multiple-effect humidification (MEH), {{is a technique}} that mimics the natural water cycle on a shorter time frame by evaporating and condensing water to separate it from other substances. The driving force in this process is <b>thermal</b> <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> to produce water vapor which is later condensed in a separate chamber. In sophisticated systems, waste heat is minimized by collecting {{the heat from the}} condensing water vapor and pre-heating the incoming water source. This system is effective for small- to mid- scale desalination systems in remote locations because of the relative inexpensiveness of solar thermal collectors.|$|E
50|$|Greenpower, {{led by the}} General Director Carlos Igrejas, is {{a company}} of {{renewable}} energies, these are Photovoltaic Solar Energy and <b>Thermal</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>Energy.</b> It is located in Viana Park in Luanda with a showroom, store and assembly line of Kits. The two business areas are distribution of equipment and the realization of projects ‘chave-na-mão’ (‘key-in-hand’), being the development, the implementation {{and the maintenance of}} systems. Greenpower is installing photovoltaic systems for illumination of school, hospitals, police stations, administrative organs and public roads, and also systems for the supply of water for irrigation in agriculture and for the placement of panels for water heating. The target groups are rural populations. The company’s facilities were inaugurated in May 2012 {{in the presence of the}} Secretary of State of Energy, Joaquim Ventura. The initial investment was the amount of six million US dollars. According to Carlos Igrejas, the company expected to bill 11,5 million USD and to create 50 direct and indirect jobs, through the several projects to be implemented in the 18 provinces of Angola. The plant would have an initial workforce of 30 people. The enterprise was in the process of having some pilot experiences in the provinces of Namibe and Kwanza-Norte, in a project subsidized by the central government. The group’s administrator Carlos Rola disclosed that depending on customer needs, the mounted solar panels could cost between 1.000 and 40.000 USD. Greenpower at that time already had realized a contract with the provincial government of Luanda to install at least 500 electric power stations in seven neighborhoods.|$|E

30|$|As for the nanofluid optical properties, the {{described}} measurements {{show that}} nanohorn-based suspensions are very promising direct sunlight absorbers for <b>thermal</b> <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> exploitation. We carried out both spectrally resolved and light scattering characterizations.

Moreover, the small scattering was also combined with an overall high absorption level at the sunlight emission wavelengths. Both these effects make SWCNHs-based nanofluids very appealing as direct absorbers in innovative solar collectors. The reported scattering and absorption properties {{can be used in}} simulations and nanofluid optimization.|$|E
