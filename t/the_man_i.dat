500|$|The {{opposition}} Labour party protested at Home's appointment; its leader, Hugh Gaitskell, {{said that}} it was [...] "constitutionally objectionable" [...] for a peer {{to be in charge of}} the Foreign Office.

Hurd comments, [...] "Like all such artificial commotions it died down after a time (and indeed was not renewed with any strength nineteen years later when Margaret Thatcher appointed another peer, Lord Carrington, to the same post)." [...] The Home–Heath partnership worked well. Despite their different backgrounds and ages– Home an Edwardian aristocrat and Heath a lower-middle class meritocrat raised in the inter-war years– the two men respected and liked one another. Home supported Macmillan's ambition to get Britain into the EEC, and was happy to leave the negotiations in Heath's hands.|$|E
500|$|Author Garry Wills {{believed}} that Davis was generally underrated {{as an actress}} because her constrained part in Hellcats was her most widely seen performance. In addition, Davis downplayed her Hollywood goals: promotional material from MGM in 1949 said that her [...] "greatest ambition" [...] {{was to have a}} [...] "successful happy marriage"; decades later, in 1975, she would say, [...] "I was never really a career woman but [...] only because I hadn't found <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>I</b> wanted to marry. I couldn't sit around and do nothing, so I became an actress." [...] Ronald Reagan biographer Lou Cannon nevertheless characterized her as a [...] "reliable" [...] and [...] "solid" [...] performer who held her own in performances with better-known actors. After her final film, Crash Landing (1958), Davis appeared for a brief time as a guest star in television dramas, such as the Zane Grey Theatre episode [...] "The Long Shadow" [...] (1961), where she played opposite Ronald Reagan, as well as Wagon Train and The Tall Man, until she retired as an actress in 1962.|$|E

500|$|Debussy {{was widely}} {{held to be}} an impressionist {{composer}} – a label he intensely disliked. Many music lovers began to apply the same term to Ravel, and {{the works of the}} two composers were frequently taken as part of a single genre. Ravel thought that Debussy was indeed an impressionist but that he himself was not. Orenstein comments that Debussy was more spontaneous and casual in his composing while Ravel was more attentive to form and craftsmanship. Ravel wrote that Debussy's [...] "genius was obviously one of great individuality, creating its own laws, constantly in evolution, expressing itself freely, yet always faithful to French tradition. For Debussy, the musician and <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> <b>I</b> have had profound admiration, but by nature I am different from Debussy... I think I have always personally followed a direction opposed to that of [...] symbolism". During {{the first years of the}} new century Ravel's new works included the piano piece Jeux d'eau (1901), the String Quartet and the orchestral song cycle Shéhérazade (both 1903). Commentators have noted some Debussian touches in some parts of these works. Nichols calls the quartet [...] "at once homage to and exorcism of Debussy's influence".|$|E

Throughout the single, Fantasia [...] "candidly and guiltlessly" [...] discusses her affair by singing: [...] "I’m sleeping with <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>I</b> love because the one I’m with just ain’t good enough.” In the verses, Fantasia sings about her conflict with choosing between the two men, through lyrics such as: “Yes, I've tried to shake it off, and I even tried to pray / But I'm still waking up in a bed that don't belong to me”. She expresses pain with the lyrics [...] "See my baby's like a dream, but the other man, he haunts me". Other lyrics also include: [...] "I'm still waking up in a bed that don't belong to me...I thought about the cost, but it's a price I'm willing to pay." ...|$|E

Garrett went on to say, [...] "I definitely feel it's what Usher's been wanting to say. But at the same time, it's {{what a lot of people}} wanted to say, they just didn't know what to say." [...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News said that [...] "Usher pulls back the curtain, revealing that a rumored rift between him and his mother was very real", and the song could be heard as an [...] "postmortem" [...] on his marriage, through the lines, [...] "For you I gave my heart and turned my back against the world/ 'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl, I done damn near lost my mama, I done been through so much drama/ I done turned into <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>I</b> never thought I'd be/ I'm ready to sign them papers." ...|$|E

500|$|In a Bloomberg West {{interview}} with Emily Chang on August 26, 2015, Andy Cunningham called it [...] "a wonderful film.... It's an incredible character {{study of a}} really complex man. Aaron [...] and Danny Boyle did a fabulous job with it." [...] Her portrayal by Sarah Snook was a [...] "small role but professionally done." [...] The film also portrays Andy as participating in the iMac launch, {{even though she was}} not working with Apple at that time. Journalist Walt Mossberg compared Steve Jobs to the Orson Welles film Citizen Kane, which was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. Mossberg has stated that while both films are aesthetically well-developed, Welles created a fictional set of characters in order to clarify that his film was a work of fiction. In contrast, according to Mossberg (who knew Jobs for 14 years), Sorkin's decision to use real instead of fictional names detracts from the quality of a film which appears to be a biopic and yet is a work of fiction. Mossberg states that [...] "the Steve Jobs portrayed in Sorkin's film isn't <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>I</b> knew. Sorkin chose to cherry-pick and exaggerate some of the worst aspects of Jobs' character, and to focus on a period of his career when he was young and immature [...] It would be as if you made a movie called JFK almost entirely focused on Kennedy's womanizing and political rivalries, and said nothing about civil rights and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Sorkin opts to end his story just as Jobs is poised to both reel off an unprecedented string of world-changing products and to mature into a much broader, kinder manager and person." ...|$|E
