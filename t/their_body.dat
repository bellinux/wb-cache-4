5|$|Among {{the main}} reasons that experts cite for causing {{negative}} effects from yoga are beginners' competitiveness and instructors' lack of qualification. As the demand for yoga classes grows, many people get certified to become yoga instructors, often with relatively little training. Not every newly certified instructor can evaluate the condition of every new trainee in their class and recommend refraining from doing certain poses or using appropriate props to avoid injuries. In turn, a beginning yoga student can overestimate the abilities of <b>their</b> <b>body</b> and strive to do advanced poses before <b>their</b> <b>body</b> is flexible or strong enough to perform them.|$|E
5|$|Balaenids are {{the right}} whales. These animals have very large heads, which can make {{up as much as}} 40% of <b>their</b> <b>body</b> mass, and much of the head is the mouth. This allows them to take in large amounts of water into their mouths, letting them feed more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Flying {{squirrels}} {{and sugar}} gliders are much alike in <b>their</b> <b>body</b> plans with gliding wings stretched between their limbs, but flying squirrels are placental mammals while sugar gliders are marsupials, widely separated within the mammal lineage.|$|E
50|$|Mudmen {{are made}} of earth and mud. <b>Their</b> <b>bodies</b> are very tough, but they melt at high temperatures. They {{are said to have}} jewels hidden within <b>their</b> <b>bodies.</b>|$|R
2500|$|But {{until the}} final {{renovation}} of the world, mankind [...] "stands between the yazads and the dēws; the [...] are immortal in essence and inseparable from <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> (mēnōg), men are immortal in essence but separable from <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> (moving from gētīg to mēnōg condition), but dēws are mortal in essence and inseparable from <b>their</b> <b>bodies,</b> which may be destroyed." ...|$|R
50|$|Body {{movement}} is how one moves <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> or how someone's attitude or manners help to express how one carries themselves. Each gender has specific flow or body movements that are normal for them. Females experience <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> in more guarded way, how to hamper their movement {{and do not}} bring <b>their</b> whole <b>bodies</b> into motion. Females are told how to sit, stand and walk properly. Females are more nonverbal and tend to use more facial expressions and more body movement than males. Males are taught to use and abuse <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> and put <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> into an aggressive motion. Males have more expansive movements and show higher levels of activity than females.|$|R
5|$|Orangutans {{are very}} {{technically}} adept nest builders, making a new nest each evening in only 5 to 6 minutes and choosing branches which they know can support <b>their</b> <b>body</b> weight.|$|E
5|$|Order Paleonemertea. Comprises 100 marine species. <b>Their</b> <b>body</b> wall has outer {{circular}} {{and inner}} length-wise muscles. In addition, Carinoma tremaphoros has circular and inner length-wise {{muscles in the}} epidermis; the extra muscle layers seem to be needed for burrowing by peristalsis.|$|E
5|$|Red fox body {{language}} consists of {{movements of the}} ears, tail and postures, with <b>their</b> <b>body</b> markings emphasising certain gestures. Postures {{can be divided into}} aggressive/dominant and fearful/submissive categories. Some postures may blend the two together.|$|E
50|$|Purple tangs grow to {{a maximum}} length of near 25 cm. <b>Their</b> <b>bodies</b> are purple in color with a yellow tail. The heads of purple tangs are covered with black spots, and black {{horizontal}} lines run {{down the sides of}} the bodies of some specimens. The center of <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> are sometimes a darker color of purple relative to the rest of <b>their</b> <b>bodies.</b> On most specimens, the tips of their pectoral fins are yellow.|$|R
5000|$|Maori navigators used manoi {{to protect}} <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> from cold, harsh winds and salt water during long canoe expeditions at sea. (Even today, many divers rub monoi all over <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> prior to diving {{for the same}} purpose.) ...|$|R
50|$|Every winter a few {{persons are}} killed by {{avalanches}} while crossing Lowari Top. <b>Their</b> <b>bodies</b> are buried under the snow {{and it is only}} when the summer comes and the snow melts that <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> are found and their fate learned.|$|R
5|$|Siberian {{accentors}} {{are typically}} skulking birds, readily disappearing into cover. They have an above average {{ability to maintain}} <b>their</b> <b>body</b> temperature in cold conditions, an adaptation to their sometimes cold environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} (as at 2010) of two breeding {{pairs of}} wild peregrine falcons (nesting {{one in each}} of the telescope's two support towers) prevents the nuisance of pigeon infestation (by droppings fouling, and <b>their</b> <b>body</b> heat affecting sensitive instrument readings) that some other radio telescopes suffer from.|$|E
5|$|They {{can strike}} to a {{distance}} of about one third of <b>their</b> <b>body</b> length, but juveniles will launch their entire bodies forwards in the process. These snakes rarely grip their victims, instead releasing quickly to return to the striking position.|$|E
5000|$|Skimmers {{use drugs}} and meditative {{techniques}} to temporarily eject their souls from <b>their</b> <b>bodies.</b> While they can enter and exit {{the spirit world}} quickly, their close connection to their empty shells means damage they take as a ghost manifests on <b>their</b> <b>bodies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Akera is a {{primitive}} genus. These sea hares {{do not fit}} completely in their external shell; it just covers their visceral hump which is positioned at the posterior end of <b>their</b> <b>bodies.</b> <b>Their</b> streamlined <b>bodies</b> are adapted for burrowing.|$|R
50|$|They are toxic species. When under threat, they {{release a}} liquid toxin {{through the small}} {{openings}} on <b>their</b> <b>bodies.</b> The liquid is strong and may cause irritation if {{in contact with the}} eyes. They warn predators by raising <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> and dipping <b>their</b> heads downwards when threatened.|$|R
5|$|Toucans are near-passerine birds {{from the}} Neotropics. They are brightly marked and have {{enormous}} colorful bills {{which in some}} species amount to half <b>their</b> <b>body</b> length.|$|E
5|$|A {{decompression}} {{schedule is}} a specified ascent rate and series of increasingly shallower decompression stops—often for {{increasing amounts of}} time—that a diver performs to outgas inert gases from <b>their</b> <b>body</b> during ascent to the surface {{to reduce the risk}} of decompression sickness. In a decompression dive, the decompression phase may make up a large part of the time spent underwater (in many cases it is longer than the actual time spent at depth).|$|E
5|$|A flight {{behaviour}} {{in which}} a bird rapidly descends with a zig-zagging, side-slipping motion. During whiffling, some birds invert the aerodynamic mechanics of <b>their</b> <b>body</b> that normally provide lift—flying by turning their bodies upside down but with their necks twisted 180 degrees to keep their heads in a normal flying position—resulting in a rapid plummet, before a quick arrest of the fall by resuming a normal flying orientation.|$|E
50|$|Winter {{flounder}} can be differentiated {{from the}} commonly co-occurring Summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) by their small teeth and eyes nearly always positioned {{on the right}} side of <b>their</b> <b>bodies.</b> Meanwhile, Summer flounder have their eyes on the left side of <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> and possess large, conspicuous teeth.|$|R
50|$|Meins are {{souls who}} defy God and create fake <b>bodies</b> for <b>their</b> souls to reside in. However as <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> are fake {{they have to}} consume other souls {{regularly}} to maintain the condition of <b>their</b> <b>bodies.</b> Thus they wish for a human <b>body</b> for <b>their</b> soul to live in permanently, {{which is why they}} are desperately after Shi-Hoon and Soo-In as <b>their</b> young <b>bodies</b> can fetch a high price.|$|R

5|$|Adult Eurasian rock pipits have a {{complete}} moult in August–September, at which time juveniles replace <b>their</b> <b>body</b> and some wing covert feathers, giving them an appearance very like the adults. From late January to early March there is a partial moult and individually variable moult of some body and wing covert feathers, and sometimes the central tail feathers.|$|E
5|$|Adults have {{forewings}} {{that are}} yellowish brown {{in color and}} have a dark spot located {{in the center of}} <b>their</b> <b>body.</b> The moths have a wingspan ranging from 32 to 45mm, and live over thirty days in optimal conditions. However, the life span ranges from five to fifteen days on average. They are nocturnal and hide in vegetation during the day. Adult moths collect nectar or other plant exudates from a large number of plants, and live for 12 to 16 days. Females can lay up to 2,500 eggs in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|All {{elephants}} {{have several}} distinctive features, {{the most notable}} {{of which is a}} long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control <b>their</b> <b>body</b> temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.|$|E
2500|$|Níðings were {{considered}} to re-enter <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> after death by their seiðr magic and even <b>their</b> dead <b>bodies</b> themselves were regarded as highly poisonous and contagious. To prevent them from coming back as the undead, <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> {{had to be made}} entirely immobile, especially by impaling, burning up, drowning in rivers or bogs (see also Tacitus), or even all of the above. [...] "Not any measure to this end was considered too awkward." ...|$|R
40|$|A lot of {{research}} supports the theoretical notion that bodies are a site of turmoil for many adolescent girls. Numerous articles state that adolescent girls struggle with <b>their</b> weight and <b>body</b> image and that this discontentment can lead to serious problems such as lower self-esteem, depression, and eating disorders. However, {{there has been little}} research that documents how girls themselves talk about, relate to, experience and live in <b>their</b> <b>bodies.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore aspects of how, at the beginning of the 21 st century, a group of adolescent girls in a single sex school experience <b>their</b> <b>bodies.</b> Eleven grade 10 girls, age 15 and 16, volunteered to participate in this study. Data was collected using six in depth group interviews and individual drawings. Although the media does play an important role in the lives of these young women, results indicate that the participants' parents play just as equally critical a role and that they have a tremendous influence on how the girls experience <b>their</b> <b>bodies.</b> Moreover, issues like choosing their clothing, being labelled based on what they wore and the idea of feeling comfortable (both physically and psychologically) in <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> were examined in order to try and obtain a clearer picture of how these young women experienced <b>their</b> <b>bodies.</b> It was discovered that although they often felt ill at ease with <b>their</b> <b>bodies,</b> it was not a permanent or ever lasting feelin...|$|R

5|$|Although Cuban iguanas {{typically}} remain {{still for}} long periods of time and have a slow lumbering gait due to <b>their</b> <b>body</b> mass, they are capable of quick bursts of speed for short distances. Younger animals are more arboreal and will seek refuge in trees, which they can climb with great agility. The animal is a capable swimmer and will take to nearby water if threatened. When cornered they can bite and lash their tails in defense.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support <b>their</b> <b>body</b> weight rather than their muscles.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{cautious}} {{when approaching}} the colony and no bird likes {{to land in}} a location where other puffins are not already present. They make several circuits of the colony before alighting. On the ground they spend much time preening, spreading oil from their preen gland and setting each feather in its correct position with beak or claw. They also spend time standing by their burrow entrances and interacting with passing birds. Dominance is shown by an upright stance, with fluffed chest feathers and cocked tail, an exaggerated slow walk, head jerking and gaping. Submissive birds lower their head and hold <b>their</b> <b>body</b> horizontal and scurry past dominant individuals. Birds normally signal their intention to take off by briefly lowering <b>their</b> <b>body</b> before running down the slope to gain momentum. If a bird is startled and takes off unexpectedly, a panic can spread through the colony with all the birds launching themselves {{into the air and}} wheeling around in a great circle. The colony is at its most active in the evening, with birds standing outside their burrows, resting on the turf or strolling around. Then the slopes empty for the night as the birds fly out to sea to roost, often choosing to do so at fishing grounds ready for early morning provisioning.|$|E
