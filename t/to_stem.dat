5|$|Early in the 1190s, the Georgian {{government}} began {{to interfere in}} the affairs of the Ildenizids and of the Shirvanshahs, aiding rivaling local princes and reducing Shirvan to a tributary state. The Ildenizid atabeg Abu Bakr attempted <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> the Georgian advance, but suffered a defeat at the hands of David Soslan at the Battle of Shamkor and lost his capital to a Georgian protégé in 1195. Although Abu Bakr was able to resume his reign a year later, the Ildenizids were only barely able to contain further Georgian forays.|$|E

5|$|Franklin Pierce (November 23, 1804October 8, 1869) was the 14th President of the United States (1853–57). Pierce was a {{northern}} Democrat {{who saw the}} abolitionist movement as a fundamental threat to {{the unity of the}} nation. His polarizing actions in championing and signing the Kansas–Nebraska Act and enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act alienated anti-slavery groups while failing <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> conflict between North and South setting the stage for Southern secession and the American Civil War. Historians and other scholars generally rank Pierce among the worst of U.S. Presidents.|$|E

40|$|The derivational {{morphology}} of Munsee Delaware, an Eastern Algonquian {{language spoken}} in southwestern Ontario, is analysed and described. Chapter I presents general information about Delaware, including {{a summary of}} grammatical information necessary for the understanding of word structure. The theoretical constructs assumed are summarized. A distinction is made between primary derivation, in which suffixes are attached to roots (and affixes) to form stems; and secondary derivation, in which suffixes are attached <b>to</b> <b>stems</b> <b>to</b> form new <b>stems.</b> Inflectional affixes are attached <b>to</b> <b>stems</b> which are formed in primary or secondary derivation. Chapter II discusses verb-forming suffixes ('finals') added to roots and certain suffixes <b>to</b> form verb <b>stems.</b> Chapter III discusses verb-forming suffixes which attach to existing noun and verb <b>stems</b> <b>to</b> form verb <b>stems</b> (secondary derivation). Chapter IV discusses 'medials', which prototypically occur between roots and 'final' suffixes. Chapter V discusses noun-forming suffixes which are attached to roots and medials. Chapter VI discusses noun-forming suffixes which attach to existing noun and verb <b>stems</b> <b>to</b> form noun <b>stems</b> (secondary derivation). Chapter VII discusses bound variants of noun stems, morphological elements which occur as members of morphologically complex noun stems...|$|R

These controls were gradually lifted in the Western zones, but were tightened between Western and Soviet zones in 1946 <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> a flow of economic and political refugees from the Soviet zone.

5|$|A global {{strategy}} <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> {{the crisis}} was released in 2005 {{in the form of}} the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan. Developed by over eighty leading experts in the field, this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost. The Amphibian Specialist Group of the IUCN is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation. Amphibian Ark is an organization that was formed to implement the ex-situ conservation recommendations of this plan, and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world, encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians. One such project is the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project that built on existing conservation efforts in Panama to create a country-wide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis.|$|E

The subject of volunteers was also much discussed, with little result; although agreements were signed late on in the war, these were made outside the Committee. Efforts <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> the flow of war materials to Spain were largely unsuccessful, with foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War proving instrumental to its outcome. Nazi Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union consistently broke the agreement they had signed, France occasionally so. Britain remained largely faithful to it.|$|E

5|$|After resigning, Aqil left Galilee for Tell el-Hesi in {{the region}} of Gaza. Around this time, Aqil married off a {{daughter}} of his to the leading Bedouin sheikh of the area, Rabbah al-Wahaidi. Bedouin raiding, now with the participation of the smaller tribes of Galilee, resumed not long after Aqil's resignation and concerns by the local merchants and European consuls were voiced to Kapuli Pasha due to the incoming harvest season for cotton and grain from Galilee and Hauran. Hasan Effendi sought <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> the tide of looting by attempting to play one Bedouin tribe off of the other. Kapuli Pasha was doubtful of this policy's effectiveness and strove to use military force instead. He personally led a contingent of troops in Galilee and ensured a peaceful harvest through the end of 1863. However, Kapuli Pasha determined that he could not keep a large, permanent military contingent in Galilee and decided to reinstate Aqil to his former position after lobbying from the British consul of Haifa.|$|E

David calls a meeting with Charles and Jim (John Krasinski), but Charles insists Dwight (Rainn Wilson) also be present because he had been Charles's right-hand man. However, during the meeting Dwight embarrasses Charles with outlandish suggestions, such as unleashing a hive of bees.|$|E
5|$|Born in Exeter around 1125, Baldwin {{was the son}} of Hugh d'Eu, Archdeacon of Totnes, and a {{woman of}} unknown name who later became a nun. Gervase of Canterbury's story that he was from an even humbler {{background}} has been shown by modern scholarship <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> from bias on the medieval chronicler's part. It is possible that he studied at Bologna in the 1150s with the future Pope Urban III. Robert Warelwast, who was Bishop of Exeter from 1138 to 1155, had sent Baldwin to Italy to study law. Baldwin was also said to have taught at Exeter, although this is not substantiated by any contemporary record. In 1150 or 1151 Pope Eugene III appointed him tutor to Eugene's nephew. By 1155 Baldwin seems to have returned to England, where he joined the household of Robert of Chichester, Bishop of Exeter.|$|E
