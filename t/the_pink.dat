5|$|UNPROFOR and the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) {{requested}} the HV to withdraw to positions held before the offensive, but the HV declined the request. However, Croatia agreed that UNPROFOR and ECMM monitors {{would continue to}} be present in <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> zones when Croatia assumed control over them. The move was planned as a way to reassure the Serb population that <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> zones could provide them safety. In the aftermath of the offensive, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) adopted the UNSC Resolution 762, urging cessation of hostilities in or near the UNPAs, and urging the HV to pull back to positions held before 21 June. The 113th Brigade of the HV remained at the plateau regardless. The resolution authorised the UNPROFOR to perform monitoring of <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> zones. It also recommended establishment of a joint commission chaired by an UNPROFOR representative, and including representatives of the Government of Croatia, local authorities and the ECMM to oversee restoration of Croatian control in <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> zones.|$|E

5|$|After his death, MGM {{tried to}} {{continue}} with Romance of <b>the</b> <b>Pink</b> Panther and offered the role of Clouseau to Dudley Moore, who turned it down.

In 1982 Edwards released Trail of <b>the</b> <b>Pink</b> Panther, which was composed entirely of deleted scenes from his past three Panther films. Frederick sued, claiming the use of the clips was a breach of contract; the court awarded her $1million ($ million today), plus 3.15 per cent of the film's profits and 1.36 per cent of its gross revenue.|$|E

5|$|Jasper Sharp {{points out}} that the Japanese and western views of Takechi's legacy are quite different. While western sources assess him as a major figure in the early {{development}} of <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> film, many current Japanese sources on the subject ignore his work. Sharp notes, however, that during his lifetime, he was covered prominently in Japanese sources. He speculates that his legacy has been largely forgotten in his homeland partly because of his status as an outsider in the Japanese film communities—both mainstream and pink. Since his films were self-produced and distributed by major film companies rather than through the eroduction circuit, they are not technically pink films. Also, his right-wing political background conflicts with the generally revolutionary stance more often associated with <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> film. Since his death in 1988, the lack of a studio or other publicist, or coverage by writers on <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> film has kept his work out of the public's eye in Japan. In the west, however, some of Takechi's films, such as Daydream were shown during their first runs, reviewed by major publications such as Variety, and have been preserved and remained available to genre audiences on home video releases.|$|E
5|$|Takechi's Daydream {{had been}} {{considered}} a national embarrassment by the Japanese government because of its highly publicized release while the world {{was focused on the}} country for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Takechi's third film had suffered heavily from the governmental censorship, yet no legal action had been taken. Takechi's fourth film, the Nikkatsu-produced Black Snow (1965), was even more controversial than his previous work. David Desser credits Black Snow with bringing a political theme to <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> film. Politics would be featured in many later films in <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> genre, most notably those of Kōji Wakamatsu.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pink</b> Structure (Estructura Rosada in Spanish) {{was built}} as a low {{platform}} during {{the first part of}} the Middle Preclassic, at a time when the city was producing Olmec-style sculpture and La Venta was flourishing on the Gulf coast of Mexico (c.800–700 BC). During the latter part of the Middle Preclassic (c.700–400 BC), <b>the</b> <b>Pink</b> Structure was buried under the first version of the enormous Structure 7. It was at this time that the use of Olmec ceremonial structures was discontinued and Olmec sculpture was destroyed, signalling an intermediate period prior to the beginning of the city's Early Maya phase. The transition between the two phases was a gradual one, without abrupt changes.|$|E

5|$|Cockatoos are {{recognisable}} by the showy crests and curved bills. Their plumage {{is generally}} less colourful {{than that of}} other parrots, being mainly white, grey or black and often with coloured features in the crest, cheeks or tail. On average they are larger than other parrots; however, the cockatiel, the smallest cockatoo species, is a small bird. The phylogenetic position of the cockatiel remains unresolved, other than that {{it is one of}} the earliest offshoots of the cockatoo lineage. The remaining species are in two main clades. The five large black coloured cockatoos of the genus Calyptorhynchus form one branch. The second and larger branch is formed by the genus Cacatua, comprising 11 species of white-plumaged cockatoos and four monotypic genera that branched off earlier; namely <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> and white Major Mitchell's cockatoo, <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> and grey galah, the mainly grey gang-gang cockatoo and the large black-plumaged palm cockatoo.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Geneva Accord {{requiring}} {{an immediate}} withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the JNA stayed behind {{for up to}} eight months in some areas. When its troops eventually pulled out, JNA left their equipment to the RSK. As a consequence of organisational problems and breaches of ceasefire, the UN peacekeepers, named the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), did not start to deploy until 8 March. The UNPROFOR took two months to fully assemble in the UN Protected Areas (UNPAs). Furthermore, the RSK forces remained in areas outside designated UNPAs which were under RSK control {{at the time of}} the signing of the Implementation Agreement ceasefire of 3 January 1992. Those areas, later better known as <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> zones, were supposed to be restored to Croatian control from the outset of the plan implementation. Failure of this aspect of the implementation of the Vance plan made <b>the</b> <b>pink</b> zones a major source of contention for Croatia and the RSK.|$|E
