The strongest testable implication for instrument validity is given by the condition for nonnegativity of point-identifiable complier's outcome densities. Our specification test infers this testable implication using a variance-weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic. Implementation of the proposed test does not require smoothing parameters, even though the testable implications involve non-parametric densities.

40|$|Animals use {{classical}} conditioning to learn predictive relationships between flavors and postingestive nutrients, which {{allows them to}} regulate their body weights. This is made difficult by modern diets, which have confusing flavor-nutrient relationships due to added fats, sugars, and flavors in processed foods. Cafeteria diets containing a variety of human-typical foods are often used to {{study the effects of}} a modern diet in animal models. Foods used in cafeteria diets typically combine aspects such as high-fat high-sugar, variety, and high palatability. However, no past studies have analyzed the effect of variety on flavor-nutrient learning by using only natural foods. In the current study, 36 rats were assigned to three dietary conditions: a processed foods (PF) cafeteria diet, natural foods (NF) cafeteria diet, or chow-only control (CON) diet. After three months on the diets, rats were tested on their ability to learn about new foods and on their response to sweet taste.

40|$|Objective: The primary motor cortices (M 1) are conneted through transcallosal fibres, which induce {{inhibitory}} input in homologous {{areas of the}} contralateral M 1. This {{is thought to be}} mediated via excitatory transcallosal neuronal pathways acting on inhibitory interneurons. IHI is a neurophysiological principle, which ist relevant concerning uni- and bilateral coordination and execution of movements. Meanwhile there is plenty of evidence for altered IHI under pathological conditions, e. g. Morbus Parkinson or Multiple Sclerosis (MS). There exist many studies concerning interaction with intracortical inhibition which suggest a postsynaptic GABAB mechanism. However the neurotransmitter system controlling IHI was not tested directly in humans so far. These hypotheses were derived from animal studies on neurotransmitter systems: 1. 	Baclofen leads to enhancement of l-IHI via postsynaptic GABAB receptors. 2. 	Midazolam increases s-IHI by stimulating the GABAA-receptors. 3. 	Transcallosal inhibition is regulated by presynaptic GABAB-receptors. We tested these hypotheses in healthy humans. Methods: The experiments using paired-puls paradigms consisted of six measurements, three with and three without medication (s-ICI, l-ICI, IHI) (experiment 1 : Baclofen, n= 17, experiment 2 : n= 10). IHI was <b>tested</b> <b>with</b> <b>conditioning</b> stimulus 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 150, 200 ms before the teststimulus. EMG was recorded from the relaxed first dorsal interosseus muscle of the dominant hand. The peak to peak amplitudes of conditioned muscle response were averaged and normalised as percentage of the unconditioned teststimulus response. Results: Baclofen strengthend l-IHI between 20 - 50 ms significantly. This result was also observed at ISI 100 - 200 ms. S-IHI was not significantly enhanced by Baclofen, but showed a non significant trend towards more inhibtion. This might be the result of presynaptic activation of GABAB receptors on excitatory synapses, or through inhibition via presynaptic neurotransmission on GABAA-ergic interneurons. Conclusion: This is the first human study evaluating the effect of Baclofen and Midazolam on IHI. Our results support the hypothesis that l-IHI in humans is mediated by postsynaptic GABAB receptors. Regarding s-IHI our results are inconclusive and require further investigation in the future. Our results contribute {{to a better understanding of}} neurotransmission in IHI and of transcallosal connectivity...|$|R
50|$|Another study, {{conducted}} by Gisquet-Verrier et al., tested {{the effects of}} the hippocampus, in three experiments, on both the freezing behavior and avoidance. The rats were lesioned with ibotenic acid, and were tested against a control group. They first investigated changes from conditioned fear, and results showed that lesions to the hippocampus did not alter freezing behavior and marginally affected avoidance. Next, they tested single conditioning sessions, and it was found that freezing behavior remained unchanged while avoidance was disrupted. Finally, they <b>tested</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>with</b> a larger stimulus (footshock intensity). It was found that avoidance was unaltered while freezing behavior decreased. Not only did these investigations show that the hippocampus is involved with freezing behavior, but avoidance and freezing behavior do not seem to have similar ways of being quantified when it comes to fear conditioning.|$|R
40|$|Piezocrystals, {{especially}} the relaxor-based ferroelectric crystals, {{have been subject}} to intense investigation and development within the past three decades, motivated by the performance advantages offered by their ultrahigh piezoelectric coefficients and higher electromechanical coupling coefficients than piezoceramics. Structural anisotropy of piezocrystals also provides opportunities for devices to operate in novel vibration modes, such as the d 36 face shear mode, with domain engineering and special crystal cuts. These piezocrystal characteristics contribute to their potential usage {{in a wide range of}} low- and high-power ultrasound applications. In such applications, conventional piezoelectric materials are presently subject to varying mechanical stress/pressure, temperature and electric field conditions. However, as observed previously, piezocrystal properties are significantly affected by a single such condition or a combination of conditions. Laboratory characterisation of the piezocrystal properties under these conditions is therefore essential to fully understand these materials and to allow electroacoustic transducer design in realistic scenarios. This will help to establish the extent to which these high performance piezocrystals can replace conventional piezoceramics in demanding applications. However, such characterisation requires specific experimental arrangements, examples of which are reported here, along with relevant results. The measurements include high frequency-resolution impedance spectroscopy with the piezocrystal material under mechanical stress 0 – 60 MPa, temperature 20 – 200 °C, high electric AC drive and DC bias. A laser Doppler vibrometer and infrared thermal camera are also integrated into the measurement system for vibration mode shape scanning and thermal <b>conditioning</b> <b>with</b> high AC drive. Three generations of piezocrystal have been tested: (I) binary, PMN-PT; (II) ternary, PIN-PMN-PT; and (III) doped ternary, Mn:PIN-PMN-PT.

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} whether {{workers of}} the ant species Lasius niger are able to sense and discriminate the coarseness of the substrate on which they walk. First, we studied {{the way in which}} substrate coarseness affects the ants' locomotory behaviour. Second, we investigated the spontaneous preference of ants for substrates of different coarseness. And third, we <b>tested</b> <b>with</b> a differential <b>conditioning</b> procedure the ants' capacity to learn to associate a given coarseness with a food reward. The locomotory behaviour of ants differed according to substrate coarseness: ants moved significantly faster and had more sinuous trajectories on a fine than on a coarse substrate. No spontaneous preference for a substrate of a given coarseness was observed and, even after 20 successive conditioning trials, there was little evidence of the effect of experience on substrate coarseness discrimination. Overall however, ants trained on fine sand made significantly more correct choice than those trained on coarse sand. We discuss these results and argue that in L. niger substrate coarseness may be more important at the collective level, by interacting with the chemical properties of the pheromone trail used in mass recruitment to food source, than at the individual level...|$|R

40|$|UNLABELLED: Abstract Background: Chemo-somatosensory evoked {{potentials}} (CSSEPs) elicited by chemical stimulation (CO₂ gas) of {{the nasal}} mucosa {{have been shown to}} be sensitive enough to pick up even weak analgesic effects. With the present study we wanted to investigate whether CSSEPs are also a sensitive tool to capture endogenous pain inhibitory mechanisms elicited by conditioned pain modulation (CPM; where a first conditioning stimulus reduces the sensitivity for a second <b>test</b> stimulus) <b>with</b> a <b>conditioning</b> stimulus of rather low noxious load. METHODS: Seventeen healthy participants were tested for CPM effects (conditioning stimulus: tonic heat pain with intensities around the pain threshold induced via a thermode; test stimulus: chemonasal stimulation (73 % and 78 % CO₂)) on CSSEPs and on self-report ratings. RESULTS: We found significant CPM effects in the CSSEPS, with reduced amplitudes and prolonged latencies at several electroencephalogram (EEG) recording positions when using the lower CO₂ concentration (73 % CO₂). In contrast to the visible inhibitory effects on the CSSEPs, subjective ratings of the test stimulus did not reflect CPM action. DISCUSSION: The experimental pain model using CO₂ stimuli to elicit CSSEPs proved to be sensitive enough to capture weak CPM effects elicited by a conditioning stimulus of rather low noxious load. The usage of such mild noxious conditioning stimuli-in contrast to stimuli of higher noxious load (e. g., cold pressor test) -has the advantage that the activation of other types of pain inhibitory mechanisms in parallel (like attentional distraction, stress-induced analgesia) can be avoided...|$|R
