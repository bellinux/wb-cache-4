5|$|Stalin {{reacted to}} the growing {{strength}} of Trotsky's supporters with a major political massacre of people within the Soviet Union, and the assassination of Trotsky's supporters and family abroad. He had agents go through historical documents and photos in order to attempt to erase Trotsky's memory from <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>books.</b> According to the historian Mario Kessler, Stalin's supporters turned to anti-semitism to whip up sentiment against Trotsky (as Trotsky was a Jew). Stalin's daughter later claimed that his fight with Trotsky laid the foundations for his later anti-semitic campaigns.|$|E
5|$|The Canadiens {{played their}} first game on January 5, 1910, coached by Jack Laviolette. Before a sellout crowd of 3,000, they {{defeated}} Cobalt 7–6 in overtime. The victory was erased from <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>books</b> shortly after, as the CHA collapsed after {{only two weeks}} of play, and the NHA chose to restart the season after absorbing the CHA's Ottawa Senators and the Montreal Shamrocks. The Canadiens' {{first game of the}} new season was played January 19, a 9–4 loss to the Renfrew Creamery Kings. They lost three more games before finally recording their first victory of the new season on February 7, when they defeated the Haileybury Hockey Club by a score of 9–7. They won only two of their 12 games that season, and finished last in the eight-team league.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the series, events {{converge}} with accepted history, when King Richard IV and {{his entire}} family are poisoned, allowing Henry Tudor to take the throne as King Henry VII. He then rewrites history, presenting Richard III as a monster, and eliminating Richard IV's reign from <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>books.</b> In reality, Richard, Duke of York, one of the Princes in the Tower, was only twelve years old (and perhaps two years dead) when the Battle of Bosworth Field took place in 1485, and thus too young to have had two adult sons. One notable anachronism is Edmund´s title, Duke of Edinburgh, as Scotland was an independent kingdom ruled by a different royal house from its inception in the ninth century until 1603 (with the exception of some periods during the turmoil of the Scottish Wars of Independence) though given that this is an alternate history, it is possible that Henry Tudor falsified the history of Scotland as well.|$|E

5|$|Five {{years after}} his death, sons Robert and Samuel Wilberforce {{published}} a five-volume biography about their father, and subsequently a collection of his letters in 1840. The biography was controversial in that the authors emphasised Wilberforce's role in the abolition movement and played down the important work of Thomas Clarkson. Incensed, Clarkson came out of retirement {{to write a book}} refuting their version of events, and the sons eventually made a half-hearted private apology to him and removed the offending passages in a revision of their biography. However, for more than a century, Wilberforce's role in the campaign dominated <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>books.</b> Later historians have noted the warm and highly productive relationship between Clarkson and Wilberforce, and have termed it one of history's great partnerships: without both the parliamentary leadership supplied by Wilberforce and the research and public mobilisation organised by Clarkson, abolition could not have been achieved.|$|E

25|$|In the 16th century, {{a number}} of {{businessmen}} from the Coevorden area (and {{the rest of the}} Netherlands) moved to England. Some of them were known as Van Coeverden.

25|$|During the Soviet era, {{the rebels}} were persecuted and the {{uprising}} was censored out of <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>books.</b> Memoirs and studies published mainly by Lithuanian-Americans inflated {{the total number}} of the Lithuanians activists to 90,000 or 113,000 and casualties to 2,000 or 6,000. After Lithuania regained independence in 1990 and new documents became available, historians have revised the estimates to 16,000–20,000 active participants and 600 casualties. Most of the rebels were young men, between 18 and 25 years old. Soviet losses are estimated at 5,000 men.|$|E
25|$|For a {{long while}} Birkenshaw's {{performances}} for Leicestershire were rather disappointing.

Losses continued to mount for the Suns as their losing streak reached an astonishing 21 matches and began to put coach Guy McKenna's future in question.

25|$|Paintball {{is a very}} niche yet {{extremely}} {{competitive sport}} in Thailand. Thai paintball teams {{are considered to be}} one of the strongest, if not the strongest in Asia.

This trend continued into 2015, with Thai teams taking victories in Divisions 1 and 2 during the PALS World Cup 2015. Along with winning the PALS World Cup titles in 2014 and 2015, all respective teams also took the overall series titles for their respective divisions in 2014 and 2015. Thai paintball continues to grow at a slow pace, thus allowing the community to be a very well knit family.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} {{was laid}} for the 1979/80 season, one that goes down in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>books</b> as the club's greatest. Stan Davis {{took over the}} reigns of the first eleven, and immediately led them to a long-awaited premiership. Bowling first, Jungwirth's 4/39 help dismiss Ainslie Park for just 124, which was passed {{for the loss of}} just 3 wickets, with John Chapman making 66. But a middle order collapse saw them lose 7/49, and with the final spread over 3 days, the game was far from won. But Max Summers and Stan Davis shared a last wicket stand of 83 to take the game away from the opposition, and they went on to win by 10 wickets. The club achieved its only senior trifecta, with the 2nd and 3rd elevens also victorious. And capping off a stunning season, were victories to both under 12s sides that included future stars in Michael and Cameron Day, Colin Dorning, Tony Sturesteps, Darren Peters, Brendan Baker and Greg Creber.|$|E
