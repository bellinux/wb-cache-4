5|$|Hinton {{followed}} the advice {{given to her}} and wrote her second novel, That Was Then, This Is Now in 1971. Following that, she wrote her shortest novel, Rumble Fish; {{it was published in}} 1975 after she had published a short story version in a 1968 edition of University of Tulsa's Alumni Magazine. Four years later in 1979, Tex was published and would be Hinton's last book for nine years as she devoted her time to raise her child. Hinton's next novel Taming the Star Runner was her first book that wasn't written in first-person point of view. Seven years after Taming the Star Runner, Hinton released her first children's book, Big David, Little David, which followed with the release of <b>The</b> <b>Puppy</b> Sister in 1995. In 2004, Hawkes Harbor, Hinton's first adult novel, was released. Hinton's most recent book, Some of Tim's Stories, was published in 2007 and is Hinton's third children's book. Overall, Hinton has written nine published books.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday, March 3, Maria Freitta, {{the owner}} of the dog and the playmate of Barker, went with her mother to a vacant, newly built ranch house next door to her home. It was on 433 2nd Ave, owned by her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Pat Vecchia. Maria managed to open a 3 ft × 5 ft bedroom closet's door, and her missing dog bounded out of the closet and leaped happily at her. Also in the closet was Barker, dead, in a seated position, the hood of her blue coat {{partially}} covering her blonde hair. She was found in the same clothes she had on when she disappeared. Bits of fur from her hat were rubbed off. Police Chief Edward Garrity stated he believed that Barker had recently been placed in the closet as <b>the</b> <b>puppy</b> had been fed recently, and there was no animal waste in the closet despite the dog not being housebroken.|$|E
50|$|Naturally, in the wild, {{the mother}} will begin weaning off <b>the</b> <b>puppies</b> because <b>the</b> <b>puppies</b> will start {{developing}} teeth which will irritate the mother when <b>the</b> <b>puppies</b> are suckling.

5|$|Sources {{indicate}} that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked {{confidence in the}} film during its production, {{and he had been}} talking to various companies, ranging from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar. However, as the film progressed, Jobs became ever more excited about it, feeling that he might {{be on the verge of}} transforming the movie industry. As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of Toy Story that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public. A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond. The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of <b>the</b> <b>puppy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} long-coated Russian Toy {{is arguably}} a dog named Chikki born on 12 October 1958 to two smooth-coated dogs that both had slightly longer hair than was typical. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>puppy</b> {{was not to}} be registered as its coat was too long meet the breed standard, and usually such dogs would not participate in breeding programs and would often be put down. Chikki, however, was registered with a pedigree and purchased by Evgeniya Fominichna Zharova. Zharova is thus the long-coated variety's founding breeder as the first breeder to intentionally retain and breed a dog with a longer coat. Chikki developed an ear fringe and was mated with a female named Irma, who also had a longer coat than most smooth-coated dogs, and together they produced a litter of three long-coated puppies. Zharova developed the breed in Moscow, and so it {{came to be known as}} the Moscow Toy Terrier. The breed made its first appearance at a dog show in 1964 and the standard was set in 1966. Ten years after Chikki's birth, between 1968 and 1969, approximately 300 long-coated dogs were registered – a significant number considering that Russian Toy litters tend to be small, typically one to three puppies. Today, the long-coated variety has an established presence in Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, the Ukraine and a number of other countries, but the breeding program is particularly strong in Finland.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to fluids given to achieve adequate rehydration, each time <b>the</b> <b>puppy</b> vomits or has diarrhea {{in a significant}} quantity, {{an equal amount of}} fluid is administered intravenously.

5000|$|In The Simpsons episode [...] "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds", Mr. Burns {{plays the}} role of Cruella De Vil, but unlike her in the movies, where she steals <b>the</b> Dalmatian <b>puppies</b> to make them into fur coats, he steals Santa's Little Helper and <b>the</b> <b>puppies</b> he sired to make them into a tuxedo. And unlike Cruella, who has no {{hesitation}} in killing <b>the</b> <b>puppies,</b> Burns cannot bear to kill <b>the</b> <b>puppies</b> himself, because they are too cute. Declaring that he will never kill any animal that can perform good tricks again, Burns pays the Simpsons for <b>the</b> <b>puppies,</b> and he trains them to be world-class racing dogs. The episode also included a parody of the song, [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] from another Disney film Beauty and the Beast.|$|R
50|$|With dogs <b>the</b> <b>puppies</b> {{are slowly}} weaned off their mother, slowly {{reducing}} the amount of milk and care that the mother is giving to them. It generally is started when <b>the</b> <b>puppies</b> are 3-4 weeks old, and usually continues until they are 7-8 weeks old. It is a gradual process that occurs over several weeks. By weaning <b>the</b> <b>puppies</b> slowly, it allows the mothers milk to dry up at a slow pace, making it less stressful for the mother.|$|R
25|$|The docked {{tail of the}} Vizsla is {{significantly}} longer than that of other dogs with traditionally docked tails such as the Weimaraner, Doberman, Boxer, and Australian Shepherd. Since the tail is docked when <b>the</b> <b>puppy</b> is less than three days old, this longer dock can result in some variation in tail length among Vizsla dogs from different breeding programs.|$|E
25|$|Although {{generally}} {{a healthy and}} robust breed which {{can be expected to}} live approximately 12–14 years, the Kuvasz are prone to developmental bone problems. Accordingly, owners should take care to provide proper nutrition to their Kuvasz puppy and avoid subjecting <b>the</b> <b>puppy</b> to rough play. As with many large breeds, hip dysplasia, a painful and potentially debilitating condition, is not uncommon. Good genetics and proper nutrition as a puppy are key to avoiding these complications.|$|E
25|$|The {{confusion}} arises {{here because}} the bather is not asked if <b>the</b> <b>puppy</b> he is holding is a male, but rather if either is a male. If the puppies are labeled (A and B), each has a 50% chance of being male independently. This independence is restricted when at least A or B is male. Now, if A is not male, B must be male, and vice versa. This restriction is introduced {{by the way the}} question is structured and is easily overlookedmisleading people to the erroneous answer of 50%. See Boy or Girl paradox for solution details.|$|E

50|$|It is {{critical}} that human interaction takes place frequently and calmly from <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>puppies</b> are born, from simple, gentle handling to {{the mere presence of}} humans in the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>puppies,</b> performing everyday tasks and activities. As <b>the</b> <b>puppies</b> grow older, socialization occurs more readily the more frequently they are exposed to other dogs, other people, and other situations. Dogs who are well socialized from birth, with both dogs and other species (especially people), are much less likely to be aggressive or to suffer from fear-biting.|$|R
25|$|The two airmen {{realised}} {{that they}} had to make for the French lines at night or risk capture by the Germans before morning. Bozděch left a pan of water and some more chocolate with the dog, and they locked it inside the farmhouse before heading off across the snow to a nearby wood. Almost immediately upon leaving the property, the night sky was lit up by flares fired by the Germans as they were looking for the aircrew from the nearby crash site. They had nearly reached the trees when they could hear the dog howling from the farmhouse. They agreed that the only course of action was for Bozděch to return and kill the dog. He left Duval in the snow, {{and went back to the}} house. As he approached he searched for a large rock or heavy object with which to kill <b>the</b> <b>puppy</b> in the most humane manner he could. The dog began to throw itself at the locked door as it heard someone approaching. Bozděch opened the door and found he could not kill the animal, instead picking it up and placing it next to his chest inside his flight jacket. The trio made it into the cover of the trees, and were discovered by a party of French troops who had been sent to look for them. They took the dog back to the base with them, where Duval was sent to the hospital. Bozděch met back up with his fellow Czech airmen in exile, who all played with <b>the</b> <b>puppy.</b> It was decided to name him Ant, after their favourite aircraft from back in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
25|$|This form is {{less common}} and affects puppies {{infected}} in the uterus or shortly after birth until about 8 weeks of age. The virus attacks {{the heart muscle}} and <b>the</b> <b>puppy</b> often dies suddenly or after {{a brief period of}} breathing difficulty due to pulmonary edema. On the microscopic level, there are many points of necrosis of the heart muscle that are associated with mononuclear cellular infiltration. The formation of excess fibrous tissue (fibrosis) is often evident in surviving dogs. Myofibers are the site of viral replication within cells. The disease {{may or may not be}} accompanied with the signs and symptoms of the intestinal form. However, this form is now rarely seen due to widespread vaccination of breeding dogs.|$|E
25|$|During {{the winter}} of the Phoney War {{at the start of}} the Second World War, Václav Robert Bozděch and Pierre Duval were sent on a {{reconnaissance}} mission over the German front in their twin-seater Potez 630 aircraft from the French airbase at Saint-Dizier. It was hit by anti-aircraft fire and crashed in no-mans land between the French and German lines. Bozděch helped the injured Duval to an abandoned farm house nearby, wherein the Czech airman discovered a German Shepherd puppy on the floor in the kitchen. While the dog was not initially fond of Duval, it accepted Bozděch. Concerned that <b>the</b> <b>puppy</b> was emaciated, he began to feed it chocolate, but it would not eat it until the rations were partially melted. Bozděch also found an old frying pan, filled it with snow and melted it so that the dog could drink it.|$|E

However, hearing about the break between Dylan and Kelly and realizing that she and her old friends from Minnesota have little in common, she decides to return to Beverly Hills and {{continue}} her studies at University of California. After her return, she met a rich young man named Stuart (whom Dylan knew of as a drug dealer in the past), and soon fell in love with him. The couple get engaged even in the first few weeks of their encounter and choose Las Vegas, forcing Dylan and his friends to come and try to stop them. They succeed by using reverse psychology, pretending that they are in favor of a marriage between the two young people. Brenda's life also took a few shots during the season. When Donna and Brenda find a puppy on the street, they learn that he escaped from an animal testing laboratory and are helpless when <b>the</b> <b>puppy</b> dies. Brenda then falls into a group of animal rights activists and participates with them in the ransacking of a number of laboratories until she is arrested (Donna decides at the last minute not to join the group).

She demands that the henchmen kill and skin <b>the</b> <b>puppies</b> for her that very night before furiously leaving the house.
