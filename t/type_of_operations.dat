Two days later, the British prime minister, Winston Churchill sent a memo to his chief staff officer, General Hastings Ismay, asking him to begin {{planning}} an operation for a raid on the islands {{as soon as possible}} and stating that he felt that it would be the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> that the newly formed Commandos would be suited for. After that, things began moving very quickly. Indeed, the War Office approved the proposal for an operation later that day and shortly after planning began in earnest.|$|E
500|$|In March 1945, {{frustrated}} {{by the lack of}} response from Cobby and his staff and convinced that operations were becoming yet more wasteful, Arthur began discussing his concerns with other senior No.1 TAF pilots. First, he spoke to Wing Commander Kenneth Ranger, a senior staff officer who had served with No.9 Operational Group and had made allegations regarding the leadership of its commander, Air Commodore Joe Hewitt, who was eventually dismissed from his post. Arthur sought out Ranger as someone with [...] "moral guts", who would take [...] "a stand against the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> we were engaged in". Next, he enlisted Caldwell's support, although Caldwell was, at the time, facing charges from Cobby over liquor trafficking which made it a risk that his involvement in a protest over operations would be misconstrued as an attempt to divert attention from the charges. Arthur believed, however, that Caldwell [...] "would go as far as he possibly could to back up his opinions [...] were worth a lot more than the opinions of most other people in the area".|$|E
500|$|Many {{airports}} are facing extreme congestion, runway capacity being the scarcest resource. Congestion pricing schemes {{have been proposed}} to mitigate this problem, including slot auctions, such as with the Panama Canal, but implementation has been piecemeal. The first scheme was started in 1968 when higher landing fees for peak-hour use by aircraft with 25 seats or less at Newark, Kennedy, and LaGuardia airports in New York City. As {{a result of the}} higher charges, general aviation activity during peak periods decreased by 30%. These fees were applied until deregulation of the industry, but higher fees for general aviation were kept to discourage this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> at New York's busiest airports. In 1988 a higher landing fee for smaller aircraft at Boston's Logan Airport was adopted; with this measure much of the general aviation abandoned Logan for secondary airports. In both US cases the pricing scheme was challenged in court. In the case of Boston, the judge ruled in favor of general aviation users due to lack of alternative airports. In the case of New York, the judge dismissed the case because [...] "the fee was a justified means of relieving congestion".|$|E
