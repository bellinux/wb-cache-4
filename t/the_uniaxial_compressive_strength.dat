It has a big reproductive capacity, so several researchers ever used thermal treatment, controlled-environmental treatment, mechanical treatment and biological control treatment to inhibit Mikania micrantha growth. However, rare studies use Mikania micrantha to make building materials. In this paper we will attempt to use untreated and treated (treated by carbonization) Mikania micrantha for making building bricks.

40|$|The role {{of surface}} {{chemical}} effects in hydraulic fracturing of shale is studied using {{the results of}} unconfined compression tests and Brazilian tests on Mancos shale- cored at depths of 20 - 60 ft. The rock mineralogy, total organic carbon and cation exchange capacity were determined in order to characterize the shale.

These mechanical strengths were largely reduced on exposure to the aqueous environments studied, despite the relatively low clay and low swelling clay content of the Mancos shale. Further comparison of <b>the</b> <b>uniaxial</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>strengths</b> and tensile strengths of the shale on exposure to water, to the strengths when exposed to the surfactant solutions showed that their difference was not statistically significant indicating that exposure to water had the greatest effect on strength loss. The surface tension measurement of 2. 85 x 10 ^- 4 M DTAB and 2. 81 x 10 ^- 4 M SDBS solutions before and after equilibration with shale showed about 80 % increase in surface tension in the DTAB solution and 10 % increase in surface tension in the SDBS solution. The probable sorption mechanism is electrostatic attraction with negatively charged sites of the shale as shown by significant loss of the cationic surfactant (DTAB) to the shale surface, and the relatively minor adsorption capacity of the anionic surfactant (SDBS). Although these adsorption tests indicate interaction between the shale and surfactant solutions, within the number of tests carried out and the surfactant concentration used, the interaction does not translate into a significant statistical difference for impacts of surfactants on mechanical strength of this shale compared to the impact of water alone. The relevance of this work is to facilitate the understanding of how the strength of rock can be reduced by the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids, to achieve improved fracture performance and higher recovery of natural gas from shale reservoirs...|$|R

40|$|Three-dimensional {{surface crack}} {{initiation}} and propagation in {{two kinds of}} heterogeneous rocks were numerically investigated via parallel finite element analysis using a supercomputer. Numerically simulated rock specimens containing a pre-existing flaw were subjected to uniaxial compression until failure. The initiation and propagation of wing cracks, anti-wing cracks, and shell-like cracks were reproduced by numerical simulations. The numerically simulated results demonstrate that the further propagation of wing cracks and shell-like cracks stop due to their wrapping (curving) behavior in three-dimensional spaces, even if the applied loads continue to increase. Furthermore, rock heterogeneity could significantly influence crack propagation patterns and <b>the</b> peak <b>uniaxial</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>strengths</b> of rock specimens. Moreover, anti-wing cracks only appeared in relatively heterogeneous rocks, and <b>the</b> peak <b>uniaxial</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>strengths</b> of <b>the</b> specimens were observed {{to depend on the}} inclination of the pre-existing flaw. Finally, the mechanism of surface crack propagation is discussed in the context of numerically simulated anti-plane loading tests, wherein it was identified that Mode III loading (anti-plane loading) does not lead to Mode III fracture in rocks due to their high ratio of <b>uniaxial</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>strength</b> to tensile strength.

The two-parametric Weibull distribution was tested. The basic characteristics of both distributions were evaluated for each set and the accordance of the model distribution with an experimental distribution was tested. The ÷ 2 -test was used for testing.

It is commonly used in practice due to the ease of testing, simplicity of specimen preparation and possible field application. ISRM [5] suggested that <b>the</b> ratio between <b>uniaxial</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>strength</b> (UCS) and point load index (Is(50)) varies between 20 and 25, although researchers have found various ratio which is depend on rock types.|$|R
