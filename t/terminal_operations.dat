25|$|To support {{rescue and}} relief {{operations}} in New Orleans, the Air National Guard used Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans, in Belle Chasse, Louisiana, on the Mississippi River's West Bank. Within {{five hours of}} its orders, the 136th Airlift Wing of the Texas Air National Guard deployed 41 Air National Guardsmen to Belle Chasse. Less than 24 hours later, a C-130H landed at the air station {{with members of the}} Louisiana Air National Guard's 159th Fighter Wing. Soon more aircraft arrived, delivering troops and supplies for New Orleans; offloaded pallets were stacked 10 deep on the aircraft parking ramp. Instead of heading into the flooded city, the 136th team remained at Belle Chasse and, within 36 hours of arriving, it established a fully functioning Air <b>Terminal</b> <b>Operations</b> Center and was keeping pace with the demanding mission schedule. That Aerial Port team, augmented by U.S. Navy cargo handlers and members of the 133d Aerial Port Squadron, 133d Airlift Wing of the Minnesota Air National Guard, handled over 124 missions with 1.5 million pounds of cargo and 974 passengers in one day. As one of its most crucial tasks, the Texas squadron downloaded the German pump system used to drain the city of New Orleans because its own pumps were inundated. It also uploaded two KC-135s with 140 kennels filled with rescued dogs bound for adoption in Arizona.|$|E

2500|$|Ground {{work was}} {{contracted}} to Olav T. Meisingset & Co., with work commencing in early 1969. They used 110,000 man-hours to move [...] of earthwork. This involved filling {{in part of}} Moldefjorden, although the moraine ground eased the work. At the most thirty people {{were working on the}} project. When the groundwork was completed, there was interest from private aircraft to land. They were only held off by placing construction equipment strategically along the runway. After the asphalt was laid in 1970, the first such aircraft landed. They continued to use the aerodrome during the winter, without any official permission, yet without the airport authority taking any action to hinder the use. The first official landing was a test flight flown by the CAA on 17 March 1971. Next work commenced on the <b>terminal,</b> <b>operations</b> building and control tower. The main contractor was Arne Moen.|$|E

In 1993 just such an agreement with P brought a restructuring of the Eagle service and an upgrade of Ocean Star with the addition of larger tonnage. Further tonnage upgrading was made to Contship's Eurasia service and the Gulf Line was reconfigured as Contship Levant Line in association with four partners in 1994. With terminal [...] operations starting in Savona and Gioia Tauro in 1995 and with restructuring of the Eurasia/Medasia services and the establishing of a Med-US Gulf and Mexico service they made further service improvements.|$|E

[...] As a condition for the Exxon and Mobil merger, the European Commission ordered to dissolve the Mobil's partnership with BP, as also to sell its stake in Aral. [...] As a result, BP acquired all fuels assets, two base oil plants, and a substantial part of the joint venture's finished lubricants business, while ExxonMobil acquired other base oil plants and a part of the finished lubricants business.

40|$|Yard {{storage space}} and yard crane {{equipment}} are the core {{resources in the}} container terminal yard area. This paper studies the integrated yard space allocation (outbound container space) and yard crane deployment problem in resource-limited container terminals where yard space and yard cranes are extremely scarce. Two corresponding counterstrategies are introduced, respectively, and the integrated problem is solved as mixed integer programming. The model this paper formulated considers the container volume fluctuation of the service line, and the objective is a trade-off between yard sharing space and <b>terminal</b> <b>operation</b> cost. In numerical experiments, this paper tries to reveal the management meaning in practical <b>operation</b> of container <b>terminal</b> and provides decision support for terminal managers; therefore a series of scenarios are presented to analyze the relations among the yard sharing space, the number of yard cranes, the size of yard subblock, {{and the cost of}} <b>terminal</b> <b>operation...</b>|$|R
