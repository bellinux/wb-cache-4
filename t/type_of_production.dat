25|$|The {{making of}} good for trade {{as well as}} local use was {{established}} in the region relatively early in the pre Hispanic period because the state, especially the Central Valley, was on the trade route that connected central Mexico with Central America. One example of this is the archeological site of El Palmillo, which was a major weaving center, with the weaving of various fibers established by the Classic Period. Then as now, production was centered in households with the households varying in the intensity and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> One other common trade good was worked seashells, which the raw material coming from the Oaxacan coast despite the rough terrain, to be worked and then traded here.|$|E
500|$|During season six production, {{residents}} of Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, complained that noise levels and swearing were unbearable and inappropriate {{for them and}} their children to listen to during the night. The residents called local law enforcement agencies four or five times to deal with the late-night disturbances. Clarissa Keller, a Sherman Oaks resident, complained that she had a six-year-old son and didn't want him to listen to the swearing. She set up a petition calling for a ban on all production companies in the Sherman Oaks hills. Location managers and production crew declined to discuss the neighbors' complaints. The Bad Girls Club permit required the entire production to abide by a [...] "minimum outdoor activity and noise" [...] rule, but local residents claimed that the show did not keep noise levels down. The house for season six was rented for $20,000 a month. The owner said that he would not allow this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> to rent his home in the future.|$|E

2500|$|Dramatic {{changes were}} {{occurring}} in the service industries, as well. [...] Beginning in 1955 McDonald's provided {{one of the first}} innovations in service operations. [...] McDonald's is founded on the idea of the production-line approach to service. [...] This requires a standard and limited menu, an assembly-line <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> process in the back-room, high customer service in the front-room with cleanliness, courtesy and fast service. While modeled after manufacturing in the production of the food in the back-room, the service in the front-room was defined and oriented to the customer. It was the McDonald's operations system of both production and service that made the difference. McDonald's also pioneered the idea of franchising this operation system to rapidly spread the business around the country and later the world.|$|E

In addition, she also recorded with Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo from The Neptunes. With Norwood fearing that the pair's material would not fit {{the concept of the}} album and break her <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> unit, it was left unused however. Rapper Ja Rule, singer Babyface and production duo Soulshock & Karlin were reportedly also involved into the project but none of their songs eventually made the album's final track listing.|$|E

2500|$|During World War II, Round {{became a}} fighter {{pilot in the}} Royal Air Force and was posted to Canada and then the No. 1 British Flying Training School in Terrell, Texas, serving as a flying {{instructor}} for the United States Air Force. He then began his performing career, later recalling, [...] "I was {{doing a lot of}} singing every Sunday in churches all over Texas. I had my own plane so I would fly down 300 miles to San Antonio for an 11 a.m. service, I would sing and then I would fly back home in the evening." [...] He also performed on the radio and was offered the chance to appear as a guest in a college production in Dallas, playing Canio in Pagliacci. [...] "It was my first time in any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> but I loved it." [...] Round was offered a place at a music school in New York, but turned it down to return home to England in 1943.|$|E
2500|$|The use of hops in beer {{was written}} of in 822 by a Carolingian Abbot. Flavoring beer with hops was known {{at least since}} the 9th century, but was only {{gradually}} adopted because of difficulties in establishing the right proportions of ingredients. Before that, gruit, a mix of various herbs, had been used, but did not have the same preserving properties as hops. Beer flavored without it was often spoiled soon after preparation and could not be exported. The only other alternative was to increase the alcohol content, which was rather expensive. Hopped beer was perfected in the medieval towns of Bohemia by the 13th century. [...] German towns pioneered a new scale of operation with standardized barrel sizes that allowed for large-scale export. [...] Previously beer had been brewed at home, but the production was now successfully replaced by medium-sized operations of about eight to ten people. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> spread to Holland in the 14th century and later to Flanders and Brabant, and reached England by the late 15th century.|$|E
60|$|The mental trick {{by which}} {{the first half of}} English history has been wholly dwarfed and dehumanized is a very simple one. It {{consists}} in telling only the story of the professional destroyers and then complaining that the whole story is one of destruction. A king is at the best a sort of crowned executioner; all government is an ugly necessity; and if it was then uglier it was for the most part merely because it was more difficult. What we call the Judges' circuits were first rather the King's raids. For a time the criminal class was so strong that ordinary civil government was conducted by a sort of civil war. When the social enemy was caught at all he was killed or savagely maimed. The King could not take Pentonville Prison about with him on wheels. I am far from denying that there was a real element of cruelty in the Middle Ages; but {{the point here is that}} it was concerned with one side of life, which is cruel at the best; and that this involved more cruelty for the same reason that it involved more courage. When we think of our ancestors as the men who inflicted tortures, we ought sometimes to think of them as the men who defied them. But the modern critic of mediævalism commonly looks only at these crooked shadows and not at the common daylight of the Middle Ages. When he has got over his indignant astonishment at the fact that fighters fought and that hangmen hanged, he assumes that any other ideas there may have been were ineffectual and fruitless. He despises the monk for avoiding the very same activities which he despises the warrior for cultivating. And he insists that the arts of war were sterile, without even admitting the possibility that the arts of peace were productive. But the truth is that it is precisely in the arts of peace, and in the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> that the Middle Ages stand singular and unique. This is not eulogy but history; an informed man must recognize this productive peculiarity even if he happens to hate it. The melodramatic things currently called mediæval are much older and more universal; such as the sport of tournament or the use of torture. The tournament was indeed a Christian and liberal advance on the gladiatorial show, since the lords risked themselves and not merely their slaves. Torture, so far from being peculiarly mediæval, was copied from pagan Rome and its most rationalist political science; and its application to others besides slaves was really part of the slow mediæval extinction of slavery. Torture, indeed, is a logical thing common in states innocent of fanaticism, as in the great agnostic empire of China. What was really arresting and remarkable about the Middle Ages, as the Spartan discipline was peculiar to Sparta, or the Russian communes typical of Russia, was precisely its positive social scheme of production, of the making, building and growing of all the good things of life.|$|E
