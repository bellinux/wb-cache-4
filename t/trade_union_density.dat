Rising returns to skills in the face of large increase in the supply of skilled labor suggest a substantial shift in labor demand in favor of skilled workers.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} {{is to take a}} closer look behind the curtain of low {{aggregate}} <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>densities</b> in retail and to outline the major obstacles and problems <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> organising faces in the retail <b>trades.</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>union</b> organising and recruitment is analysed against the background of a 'two hurdle model of organising' (cf. Haas 2000, Dribbusch 2003) derived from explanations on <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> membership put forward by Green (1990) and Disney (1990). Within this framework the first hurdle to be taken is the establishment of a workplace presence as a precondition for any sustainable membership development. The second hurdle is then to convince the potential members in the workplace to join i. e. the recruitment. To perform the task of organising, the unions have to struggle with structural constraints, but they act as well as "architects of their own destiny" (Frege 1999) having a wide range of alternative policies at their disposal (cf. Heery et al 2000). Therefore, an analysis of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> organising attempts and subsequent successes will have to combine both "structuralist" and "interventionist" perspectives (cf. Mason and Bain 1993; Kelly 1997). As organising and recruitment is a potentially contentious issue between unions and employers, the balance of power between the two parties has to be taken into account as well (cf. Kelly and Waddington 1995, Hyman 1996). The structural power of shop workers is weak as most of them are relatively easy to replace and the dispersion and fragmentation of the workforce make it particularly difficult to develop “associational power” (Wright 2000). The argument put forward is that despite structural obstacles organising and recruitment in retail is possible but that to successfully manage unionisation for more than a minority of workers will require institutional support through statutory protection and encouragement of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> membership. This paper is based on the findings of a major research study on <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> membership and organising in retail (Dribbusch 2003). The study focuses on the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw), the former Gewerkschaft Handel, Banken und Versicherungen (HBV) in Germany which merged with other unions in summer 2001 to build the 'Unified Union in the Service Sector' Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft, ver. di and the Dutch FNV Bondgenoten (respectively its predecessor until 1998 the FNV Dienstenbond). All three are by far the biggest unions in the retail industry in Germany, Great Britain and the Netherlands. <b>Trade</b> <b>union</b> data was used during the research to explore in some depth the development and structure of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> membership in the retail trades. Furthermore it is based on more than 60 interviews with experts from the three unions. Those interviews included the leading national officials responsible for organising, full-time officers from the areas and districts and lay officials from different stores in each country.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between union power, unemployment and wages. We find many theoretically well-established links suggesting that unemployment negatively affects bargaining power. As an empirical strategy we use Austrian data from 1966 until 2015 {{on the development of}} collectively bargained minimum wages. Such data directly reflects the result of a bargaining process between unions and employer organizations, and enables to show the link between bargaining power and unemployment. Moreover, it allows for further discussion on the potential influence of other macroeconomic and institutional variables, such as <b>trade</b> openness and <b>union</b> <b>density...</b>|$|R
30|$|One {{reason that}} we chose to conduct the {{analysis}} with a bargaining model of this kind is that Sweden {{has a long history}} of high <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>density</b> among workers in manufacturing industries; apart from a few years in the 1980 s when Denmark’s <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>density</b> was slightly higher, Sweden’s <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>density</b> has been the highest among the industrialised countries throughout the period studied in this paper. This also means that to the extent that unions’ bargaining power is affected by increased foreign ownership, this effect should be more pronounced in Sweden—where unions’ bargaining power was clearly very high to begin with—than in countries where unions were never particularly strong in the first place.|$|E
30|$|In Table 3, we {{test the}} {{theories}} that link the wage gap with the wage-setting institutions that {{prevail in the}} public vs. the private sector. In the joint regression of the wage gap against employment protection, <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>density,</b> collective bargaining, and centralization of wage updates, none of the covariates is statistically significant, although employment protection, <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>density,</b> and centralization bear the signs predicted by the theory; see column (1).|$|E
30|$|The next column {{shows the}} {{association}} of the <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>density</b> with the pay gap. We find that a one standard deviation increase in <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>density</b> {{is associated with a}} 6.8 percentage point decrease in the wage gap. The correlation displayed in Fig. 3 e makes apparent that this relationship is driven by the Nordic countries. Actually, removing them from the regression yields a nonsignificant relationship between both variables. Moreover, the variable <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>density</b> corresponds to the whole economy. If we consider instead the difference in <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>density</b> between the public and the private sector, we do not find a significant relationship with the public pay gap; see column (4). Nevertheless, this result must be taken with caution as the number of observations of this regression is very low. We also consider the relationship between the wage gap and the coverage of collective bargaining agreements, which may capture better the pay homogenization induced by trade unions. This relationship is negative, as expected by theory, but not statistically significant (the p value is 0.17, not shown).|$|E
5000|$|The Swedish <b>Trade</b> <b>Union</b> Confederation (Landsorganisationen i Sverige, {{literally}} [...] "National Organisation in Sweden"), {{commonly referred}} to as LO, is a national <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> centre, an umbrella organisation for fourteen Swedish <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> that organise mainly [...] "blue-collar" [...] workers. The Confederation, which gathers in total about 1,5 million employees out of Sweden's 10 million people population, was founded in 1898 by blue-collar unions on the initiative of the 1897 Scandinavian Labour Congress and the Swedish Social Democratic Party, which almost exclusively was made up by <b>trade</b> <b>unions.</b> In 2016 <b>union</b> <b>density</b> of Swedish blue-collar workers was 62%, a decline by fifteen percentage points since 2006 (<b>union</b> <b>density</b> in 2006: 77%).

30|$|A further {{feature of}} the extant studies is that they {{predominantly}} refer to Great Britain and the United States.

The objective {{of this study is to}} research two phenomena that have been identified as influences surrounding why young workers do not become unionised. The research questions are 1. Can individualistic attitudes be linked to the decline in <b>union</b> <b>density</b> among young workers, if so how? and 2. Can employer resistance towards trade unionism be linked to the decline in <b>union</b> <b>density</b> among young workers, if so how?. There are substantial amounts of quantitative research devoted to trying to understand the decline, which motivated writing a report with a qualitative approach. Focus was put on the thoughts and views of six young individuals who are all involved with three Swedish <b>trade</b> <b>unions,</b> HRF, Handels and Seko. The results of the study revealed that both individualistic attitudes and employer resistance can be linked to declining <b>union</b> <b>density</b> rates among youths. Individualistic attitudes were analysed alongside Allvin and Sverke’s theories on the ‘era of individualisation’, which includes declining preparedness to participate in collective movements, the belief in the efficacy of the self and autonomous attitudes towards institutions. Individualistic attitudes that were conferred in the interviews revolved around matters such as young workers not being able to identify themselves with <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> and their officials. Employer resistance methods were discussed in line with, among others, Brulin’s theory on the work place as a political arena, where employers and <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> battle for the loyalty of the employees.

The time series analysis indicates that <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>density</b> is a significant determinant of social expenditure, and that this effect is most prominent in coordinated market economies.
