5|$|Fielding's sixteenth play, <b>The</b> <b>Mock</b> Doctor: or The Dumb Lady Cur'd, {{replaced}} The Covent Garden Tragedy as {{the companion}} play to The Old Debauchees. The play is an Anglicised adaptation of Molière's Le Medecin malgre Lui. It first ran on 23 June 1732 {{and was later}} revised in 1732; both versions were very successful. The plot deals with a young girl pretending to be mute {{to avoid having to}} marry a man she does not like while her doctor is really a man pretending to be a doctor to con the other characters.|$|E
5|$|Power had {{suffered}} from clinical depression since childhood and confided her fugitive status to her therapist Linda Carroll. She developed {{the desire to}} stop living her life under her assumed name and, through therapy that included participation in <b>the</b> <b>mock</b> trial of a soldier charged with killing civilians during the Vietnam War, she began to prepare for her surrender to the authorities. This included her decision to marry Duncan in 1992 and reveal her background to her friends.|$|E
5|$|The Old Debauchees, {{originally}} titled The Despairing Debauchee, {{appeared with}} The Covent-Garden Tragedy on 1 June 1732. The play ran for six nights {{and was later}} paired with <b>The</b> <b>Mock</b> Doctor. The play was later revived to attack Catholics during the disputes with the Stuarts between 1745 and 1746. The play alludes to the 1731 trial of Father Girard, a Jesuit tried for using magic during an attempted seduction/rape of a young girl. The nature of the attacks against Catholicism within the play undermines the overall humour of the play.|$|E

5|$|The {{follow-up}} {{album was}} released on 2 April 2012. It describes five different scenarios of Gerald Bostock's life, where he potentially becomes a greedy investment banker, a homeless homosexual man, {{a soldier in the}} Afghan War, a sanctimonious evangelist preacher, and a most ordinary man who runs a corner store and is married and childless. Thick as a Brick 2 lists 17 separate songs merged into 13 distinct tracks (some labelled as medleys), although also all flowing together much like a single song. To follow the style of <b>the</b> <b>mock</b> newspaper on the original Thick as a Brick, a mock online newspaper was set up.|$|E
