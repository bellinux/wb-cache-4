60|$|But Angelica and Medoro {{pursued the}} rest of their journey in peace, and took ship on the coast of Spain for India; and there she crowned her bridegroom King of Cathay. The {{description}} of Orlando's jealousy and growing madness is reckoned one of the finest things in Italian poetry; and very fine it surely is--as strong as the hero's strength, and sensitive as the heart of man. The circumstances are heightened, one after the other, with the utmost art as well as nature. There is a scriptural awfulness in the account of the hero's becoming naked; and the violent result is tremendous. I have not followed Orlando into his feats of ultra-supernatural strength.

60|$|For {{we shall}} say--The pure and perfect graces, the disinterested virtues, the unselfish virtues--obedience, mercy, chivalry, beneficence, magnanimity, heroism,--in one word, self-sacrifice--{{beautiful}} these are: but are <b>they</b> <b>necessary?</b> are they mere ornaments? {{or are they}} sacred duties? The duty which dares and suffers for the thing it ought to do; the love which dares and suffers for the thing it loves; the unselfish spirit which looks for no reward:--why should these dwell in man? To that we shall answer--Because they dwell for ever in God. If we are asked--Why are they beautiful in man? we shall answer--Because they are the very beauty and glory of God; the glory which the Incarnate Word of God manifested to men, when He hung on the cross of Calvary; and was more utterly then, if possible, than ever, The Word of God: because He then declared most utterly to men the character and essence of God. Love which is not content--as what true love is?--to be a passive sentiment, a self-contained possibility, but which must go out of itself, pitying, yearning, agonizing, to seek, to struggle, to suffer, and, if need be, to die for the creature which it loves, even if that creature love it not again.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the role of {{multinational}} companies in zones of conflict. This issue has become increasingly sensitive over the last several years, particularly due to the issue of “conflict diamonds” coming from Angola and Sierra Leone, the proceeds from whose sales served to fund insurgency in these countries. The role and responsibilities of international corporations in this area have been studied. Do they initiate conflict? Do they prolong conflict? Can they play a role in mitigating or ending conflict? Where do gaps exist in the current international regulatory and policy framework? Are the tools that companies currently deploy sufficient? Are <b>they</b> <b>necessary?</b> How can we find ways forward to fill these crucial gaps? This paper seeks to provide a blueprint for tackling such questions. ...|$|E

Numerous strategies, including hypotensive anesthetic tech-niques and blood transfusion, have been developed to deal with the blood loss. Blood for transfusions can be obtained from banked blood or from autologous donation. In this study, the authors looked at 2 groups of patients who had bimaxillary orthognathic surgery. One group included patients who had autodonated blood (group 1) and who were operated on between 1991 and 1993, and the other patients did not autodonate and were operated on between 1998 and 2000 (group 2). It was found that fewer than 50 % of patients in group 1 were transfused, and none of the group 2 patients were. A protocol to lessen blood loss that should obviate the need for blood transfusion is proposed. It is concluded that blood transfusion should no longer be...|$|E

40|$|Official {{forecasts}} of international institutions are never purely model-based. Preliminary results of models are adjusted with expert opinions. What {{is the impact}} of these adjustments for the forecasts? Are <b>they</b> <b>necessary</b> to get ‘optimal ’ forecasts? When model-based forecasts are adjusted by experts, the loss function of these forecasts is not a mean squared error loss function. In fact, the overall loss function is unknown. To examine the quality of these forecasts, one can rely on the tests for forecast optimality under unknown loss function as developed in Patton and Timmermann (2007). We apply one of these tests to ten variables for which we have model-based forecasts and expert-adjusted forecasts, all generated by the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB). For almost all variables the added expertise yields better forecasts in terms of fit. In terms of optimality, the effect of adjustments for the forecasts is limited, because for most variables the assumption that the forecast are not optimal can be rejected for both the model-based and the expert-adjusted forecasts...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A common {{misconception}} among logicians is {{to think}} that intuitionism is necessarily tied-up with single conclusion (sequent or Natural Deduction) calculi. Single conclusion calculi {{can be used to}} model intuitionism and they are convenient, but by no means are <b>they</b> <b>necessary.</b> This has been shown by such influential textbook authors as Kleene, Takeuti and Dummett, to cite only three. If single conclusions are not necessary, how do we guarantee that only intuitionistic derivations are allowed? Traditionally one insists on restrictions on particular rules: implication right, negation right and universal quantification right are required to be single conclusion rules. In this note we show that instead of a cardinality restriction such as one-conclusiononly, we can use a notion of dependency between formulae to enforce the constructive character of derivations. The system we obtain, called FIL for full intuitionistic logic, satisfies basic properties such as soundness, completeness and cut elimination. We present two motivating applications of FIL and discuss some future work. Key-words: Intuitionistic Logic. Multiple-conclusion systems. Dependency relations...|$|E
