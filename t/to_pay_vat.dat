5000|$|The {{mechanism}} for achieving {{this result is}} as follows. The exporting member state zero-rates the VAT. This means that the member state of the exporting merchant does not collect VAT on the sale, but still gives the exporting merchant a credit for the VAT paid on the purchase by the exporter (in practice this often means a cash refund). The importing member state [...] "reverse charges" [...] the VAT. This means that the importer is required <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>VAT</b> to the importing member state at its rate. In many cases a credit is immediately given for this as input VAT. The importer then charges VAT on resale in the normal way.|$|E

Despite both players yet to make professional debut at that time, the aggressive price tag made both club had a profit of €1.2 million despite in form of increase in intangible asset (Tonelli for Vicenza; Bonicelli for Cesena).

40|$|Romania's {{accession}} to the European Union has required {{significant changes in}} many fields of activity, thefield of taxation {{is one of the}} most affected as taxation is fully harmonized with the European laws after January 1, 2007. Therefore, the export and import concepts disappeared in the relationship between the Member States, beingreplaced by new concepts such as intra-Community acquisition (instead of import) and intra-Community supply(instead of export). Given the intra-Community commercial transactions and hence their taxation, in this article I intend toaddress the tax treatment of non-transfers. I started from the fact that that the proper determination of tax treatments specific to intra-Communitycommercial transactions is of particular importance in establishing the reporting and payment obligations concerningthe value added tax for entities from different EU Member States, significantly affecting the registration procedure inaccounting of such transactions. To clarify the tax issues in terms of value added tax, I found it necessary, after identifying the operationsconsidered as non-transfers, to answer several questions based on which the tax treatment of such operations will bedetermined, questions that relate to the taxable person, taxable operation, the place of acquisition, the exemption or notof the operation and the obligation <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>VAT.</b> For this I took into account several specific situations that arise in trade relations between EU Member Stateswhich fall within non-transfers, examples that allowed some conclusions to be drawn on the tax issues arising in intra-Community trade relations...|$|E
40|$|Il vero punto, nel confronto tra realisti e postmodernisti, non è ovviamente l’affermazione o negazione dell’esistenza del mondo esterno, ma il costruzionismo: quanto incidono gli schemi concettuali nella costruzione della realtà naturale e sociale? Infatti nessun realista negherebbe che l’IVA dipenda da schemi concettuali (il che non significa ancora sostenere che siano puramente soggettivi: l’IVA vale – in linea di {{principio}} – per chiunque faccia acquisti in Italia). Quello che il realista si chiede è, appunto, fin dove si spinge l’azione degli schemi concettuali, ed è qui che si manifesta il dissidio tra realisti e postmodernisti. Questi ultimi sono molto più generosi nella lista delle parti di realtà che sono socialmente costruite, al punto da affermare, in taluni casi, che noi non abbiamo mai accesso a un mondo "là fuori”, ma solo con ciò che viene costruito dai nostri schemi concettuali. New Realism FAQ The actual {{issue at}} stake, in the confrontation between realists and postmodernists, {{is not whether}} you should accept or deny {{the existence of the}} external world, but the scope of constructionism: how far conceptual schemes bear on the construction of natural and social reality? Indeed, no realist would deny that the VAT depends on our conceptual schemes, which does not mean that it is purely subjective: you don’t decide whether (or to which country) you have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the <b>VAT,</b> it depends on where the purchase takes places. The realist just asks where the sphere of influence of conceptual schemes stops, and here the disagreement with the postmodernists begins. The latter are much more generous in listing the parts of reality that they consider socially constructed, up to maintaining (the most extreme ones) {{that we do not have}} any access to the world “out there”, but only to what our conceptual schemes construct...|$|R
40|$|The second {{generation}} fiscal federalism (SGFF) approach {{is used as}} a reference to analyze the political and fiscal institutional design of Bolivia’s decentralization model and its evolution. Subnational public finance data up to 2008 is used to verify that decentralization of expenditure was higher than that of revenue, establishing a context of vertical fiscal imbalance that increased due to growing fiscal transfers during the positive external shock (boom) period. Consequently, the subnational fiscal surplus was not a result of internal efficiency but of excess revenues from such transfers. Panel models were estimated to identify and assess the implicit incentives embedded in fiscal institutions of the decentralization model. Findings at the municipal level are: i) misalignment of local spending with local interests due to dominance of transfers over own revenue (dominance of central government development policies); ii) incentive to spend transfers faster than own revenue (flypaper effect); iii) greater marginal contribution of own revenue to positive fiscal balances compared to transfers, thus introducing the seed for a soft budget constraint but hidden by the fiscal surplus; iv) disincentive to generate own revenue (tax and non-tax) due to the size and growth of transfers (disincentive to the culture of contributing to own revenue). Findings at the prefectural level are: i) misalignment with regional interests given the dominance of transfers over own revenue due to absolute lack of tax powers (until 2009); ii) high tendency to a soft budget constraint and, eventually, also fiscal bail-out, hidden by the fiscal surplus; iii) in only two departments collection of national-level taxes were higher, compared to transfers received in the same departments; iv) disincentive <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the <b>VAT</b> (national-level tax) due to higher royalty transfers received, an effect not extended to other national-level taxes; v) high dependence from hydrocarbon-based transfers, and fiscal risk when this natural resource declines (both in volume and prices) due to volatility of international oil prices. Also, {{as a result of the}} decentralization model a positive and significant impact was found on education-coverage indicators, an important development objective of the national government. ...|$|R
