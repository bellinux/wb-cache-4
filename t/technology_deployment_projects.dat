40|$|Change as {{a product}} of <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> <b>projects</b> has been {{investigated}} by management literature for some time, resulting to a rich texture of theoretical paradigms. However, this research stream has focused on change as an outcome, a 'product' of a project, imposed or 'sold' upon usually mainstream operations- services, organizational processes etc. Research on project relations has focused on the behaviour outside the project-that of the stakeholders. Most literature and research recommendations focus on how to manage and handle stakeholders and focus on how to change their behaviour, externally of the project.

40|$|Abstract Background As Family Medicine {{programs}} across Canada are transitioning into a competency-based curriculum, {{medical students}} and clinical teachers are increasingly incorporating tablet computers {{in their work}} and educational activities. The purpose of this pilot {{study was to identify}} how preceptors and residents use tablet computers to implement and adopt a new family medicine curriculum and to evaluate how they access applications (apps) through their tablet in an effort to support and enhance effective teaching and learning. Methods Residents and preceptors (n = 25) from the Family Medicine program working at the Pembroke Regional Hospital in Ontario, Canada, were given iPads and training on how to use the device in clinical teaching and learning activities and how to access the online curriculum. Data regarding the use and perceived contribution of the iPads were collected through surveys and focus groups. This mixed methods research used analysis of survey responses to support the selection of questions for focus groups. Results Reported results were categorized into: curriculum and assessment; ease of use; portability; apps and resources; and perceptions about the use of the iPad in teaching/learning setting. Most participants agreed on the importance of accessing curriculum resources through the iPad but recognized that these required enhancements to facilitate use. The iPad was considered to be more useful for activities involving output of information than for input. Participants’ responses regarding the ease of use of mobile technology were heterogeneous due to the diversity of computer proficiency across users. Residents had a slightly more favorable opinion regarding the iPad’s contribution to teaching/learning compared to preceptors. Conclusions iPad’s interface should be fully enhanced to allow easy access to online curriculum and its built-in resources. The differences in computer proficiency level among users should be reduced by sharing knowledge through workshops led by more skillful iPad users. To facilitate collection of information through the iPad, the design of electronic data-input forms should consider the participants’ reported negative perceptions towards typing data through mobile devices. <b>Technology</b> <b>deployment</b> <b>projects</b> should gather sufficient evidence from pilot studies in order to guide efforts to adapt resources and infrastructure to relevant needs of Family Medicine teachers and learners...|$|E

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} user feedback {{data collected}} {{during a recent}} Accelerated Site <b>Technology</b> <b>Deployment</b> (ASTD) project: the Fluor Fernald ASTD <b>Technology</b> <b>Deployment</b> <b>Project</b> from May, 1999 through September, 2000. The main goal of the ASTD project was to use the ''Fernald approach'' to expedite the deployment of new or innovative technologies with superior safety, cost, and/or productivity benefits to Department of Energy (DOE) facilities. The Fernald approach targets technology end-users and their managers and directly involves them with hands-on demonstrations of new or innovative technologies during technology transfer sessions. The two technologies deployed through this project were the Personal Ice Cooling System (PICS) and the oxy-gasoline torch. Participants of technology transfer sessions were requested to complete feedback surveys. Surveys evaluated {{the effectiveness of the}} Fernald approach to <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> and assessed the responsiveness of employees to new technologies. This report presents the results of those surveys...|$|R

40|$|Valuation {{of large}} {{projects}} on new communications technologies is a challenging task. Major investments {{are required to}} spread out technology and services, the characteristics of which are still largely unknown. A balanced view is needed on capabilities of the technologies, market demand, and relevant value network actors and their economies. In this dissertation, comprehensive techno-economic modelling of these aspects will be introduced for valuation of selected business scenarios. The research framework is mobile data services and business architectures in the advent of new technologies, like UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System), WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) and WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access). The techno-economic method in this context comprises the modelling of a large set of technology, market and other factors {{in relation to the}} business operations of the analysed market actors. The many uncertainties concerning future service innovations and market development set demands on scenario creation and parameter estimation. Traditional techno-economic investment project calculation is not enough. This study gives devices for strategic decision making by analysing three different technology transitions: The modelling of Western-European incumbent operator business starting from the early 2000 's indicated that the UMTS deployment should be started without delay to maximise the long-term profits from the acquired licenses, contrary to looking for short-term investment payoffs that was prevalent after the telecommunications downturn. Results also show that the emerging WLAN technology would not become a substitute for UMTS, but the public WLAN will complement the UMTS based business architecture. Modelling of the upcoming mobile WiMAX in comparison to UMTS path indicated that the mobile WiMAX cannot challenge the UMTS, as the latter one offers a better business case for the key actors. In the last transition, techno-economic delta analysis was used to quantify the benefits from the fixed-mobile convergence. The main enhancements to the techno-economic method are first the extensive classification of advanced mobile services and related modelling of service diffusion, usage patterns, capacity requirements and revenues. The second contribution is to improve the analysis of service usage in relation to technology characteristics by integrating an end-user model that gives the demand and revenue potential of each service type, per user segment and utilised technology. A novelty is also the separation of network provisioning and service provisioning part of the business architecture into separate but interlinked models. The fourth contribution to the method is the application of real options method on large communications <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> <b>projects,</b> solving option modelling problems due to the complex dependencies of the project value on the investment timing. The introduced method starts from ordinary expected cash flow valuation, but adds to that the option value related to specific flexibility in the project...|$|E

40|$|A {{diagnostic}} tool {{on the decision}} of investing in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in small and medium enterprises (SME) suggested in Judith Redoli et al. (2008), showed its usefulness helping to understand how an enterprise uses ICT and ‘‘how’’ and ‘‘when’’ a company should incorporate new technological elements. The model was applied successfully {{in the assessment of}} 500 SME; as a result a <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> <b>project</b> was given to each enterprise in which a priority project was also defined. This short paper presents the second part of that study: a second assessment was made to those SME oriented to detect whether the enterprises on which the analysis was conducted did achieve the <b>deployment</b> of the <b>technologies</b> identified within six months, and the relationship between this fact and the existence of an associated grant. On the other hand, in this research the correlation between the priority project established in the first assessment and the one that was finally completed was demonstrated. </p...|$|R

TAP-IN {{was created to}} help companies access and apply defense technologies and help defense-dependent companies enter new commercial markets. Defense technologies included technologies developed by DoD, DOE, NASA, and their contractors. TAP-IN was structured to provide region-based technology access services that were able to draw on technology resources nationwide. TAP-IN provided expert assistance in all stages of the commercialization process from concept through prototype design to capital sourcing and marketing strategy. TAP-IN helped companies locate new technology, identify business partners, secure financing, develop ideas for new products, identify new markets, license technology, solve technical problems, and develop company-specific applications of federal technology. TAP-IN leveraged NASA's existing commercial technology network to create an integrated national network of organizations that assisted companies in every state.

40|$|This report {{describes}} a DOE Accelerated Site <b>Technology</b> <b>Deployment</b> <b>project</b> being conducted at Brookhaven National Laboratory to deploy innovative, radiological, in situ analytical techniques. The technologies are being deployed {{in support of}} efforts to characterize the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor (BGRR) facility, which is currently undergoing decontamination and decommissioning. This report focuses on the deployment of the Canberra Industries In Situ Object Counting System (ISOCS) and assesses its data comparability to baseline methods of sampling and laboratory analysis. The battery-operated, field deployable gamma spectrometer provides traditional spectra of counts {{as a function of}} gamma energy. The spectra are then converted to radionuclide concentration by applying innovative efficiency calculations using monte carlo statistical methods and pre-defined geometry templates in the analysis software. Measurement of gamma emitting radionuclides has been accomplished during characterization of several BGRR components including the Pile Fan Sump, Above Ground Ducts, contaminated cooling fans, and graphite pile internals. Cs- 137 is the predominant gamma-emitting radionuclide identified, with smaller quantities of Co- 60 and Am- 241 detected. The Project used the Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manual guidance and the Data Quality Objectives process to provide direction for survey planning and data quality assessment. Analytical results have been used to calculate data quality indicators (DQI) for the ISOCS measurements. Among the DQIs assessed in the report are sensitivity, accuracy, precision, bias, and minimum detectable concentration. The assessment of the in situ data quality using the DQIs demonstrates that the ISOCS data quality can be comparable to definitive level laboratory analysis when the field instrument is supported by an appropriate Quality Assurance Project Plan. A discussion of the results obtained by ISOCS analysis of objects that could not be analyzed readily by conventional methods demonstrates a powerful application of the instrument. In conclusion, a comparison of costs associated with the analysis on the ISOCS instrument to the costs of conventional sampling and laboratory analysis is presented...|$|R

This plan will {{be integrated into the}} 324 / 327 Buildings Stabilization/Deactivation Project, Project Management Plan, (HNF-IP- 1289, Rev. 1) and shall comply with the base requirements established in that document. This PIP establishes the baseline and defines the scope, schedule, budget, organizational responsibilities, reporting requirements, deliverables, and end points for the implementation of new technology into B-Cell. This shall include procurement, safety, quality assurance, training, documentation, record management, and facility modifications applicable to this project. Specifically this plan controls and executes the procurement and acceptance, qualification, and turnover of a remote/robotic work platform for 324 Building B-Cell. This includes the development of functional parameters, performance requirements, evaluation criteria, procurement specifications, acceptance and qualification test procedures, training requirements, and turnover responsibilities. The 324 / 237 Buildings Stabilization/Deactivation Project is currently in its second year of a nine-year project to complete deactivation and closure of the facility for long-term surveillance and maintenance. A major obstacles for the project is the inability to effectively perform deactivation tasks within high radioactively contaminated hot cells. The current strategies utilize inefficient and resource intensive technologies that significantly impact the cost and schedule for stabilization and deactivation.

40|$|The {{success of}} this Accelerated Site <b>Technology</b> <b>Deployment</b> (ASTD) <b>project</b> is {{measured}} on several levels. First, the deployment of this innovative approach using in situ characterization, portable field laboratory measurements, and implementation of MARSSIM was successfully established for all three phases of D and D characterization, i. e., pre-job scoping, on-going disposition of waste, and final status surveys {{upon completion of the}} activity. Unlike traditional D and D projects, since the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor Decommissioning Project (BGRR-DP) is operating on an accelerated schedule, much of the work is being carried out simultaneously. Rather than complete a full characterization of the facility before D and D work begins, specific removal actions require characterization as the activity progresses. Thus, the need for rapid and cost-effective techniques for characterization is heightened. Secondly, since the approach used for this ASTD project was not thoroughly proven prior to deployment, a large effort was devoted to demonstrating technical comparability to project managers, regulators and stakeholders. During the initial phases, large numbers of replicate samples were taken and analyzed by conventional baseline techniques to ensure that BGRR-DP quality assurance standards were met. ASTD project staff prepared comparisons of data gathered using ISOCS and BetaScint with traditional laboratory methods and presented this information to BGRR-DP staff and regulators from EPA Region II, NYS Department of Environmental Conservation, and the Suffolk County Board of Health. As the results of comparability evaluations became available, approval for these methods was received and the techniques associated with in situ characterization, portable field laboratory measurements, and implementation of MARSSIM were gradually integrated into BGRR-DP procedures...|$|R
40|$|Several current NASA {{programs}} such as the EOSDIS Core System (ECS) have data processing and data management requirements that call for an integrated planning and scheduling capability. In this paper, we describe the experience of applying advanced scheduling technology operationally, in terms of what was accomplished, lessons learned, and what remains to be done in order to achieve similar successes in ECS and other programs. We discuss the importance and benefits of advanced scheduling tools, and our progress toward realizing them, through examples and illustrations based on ECS requirements. The first part of the paper focuses on the Data Archive and Distribution (DADS) V 0 Scheduler. We then discuss system integration issues ranging from communication with the scheduler to the monitoring of system events and re-scheduling in response to them. The challenge of adapting the scheduler to domain-specific features and scheduling policies is also considered. Extrapolation to the ECS domain raises issues of integrating scheduling with a product-generation planner (such as PlaSTiC), and implementing conditional planning in an operational system.

40|$|The role of {{technology}} cooperation in international climate policy has drawn considerable attention in recent years. In this article, I examine the strategic {{benefits of a}} <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> agreement. I find that although <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> produces mostly private benefits for each country, a formal treaty can strategically increase global pollution abatement efforts. If <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> allows countries to credibly commit to pollution abatement, the international community can form two coalitions. One deploys the technology and then abates pollution, whereas the other only abates pollution. Empirically, a <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> agreement is useful and feasible when {{the total number of}} concerned countries is high and <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> is very costly but effective in reducing the cost of future pollution abatement. In addition to revealing a new strategic rationale for <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> agreements, I offer a nuanced analytical distinction between deployment versus research and development. For practical policy formation, I characterize the conditions and form of successful <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> cooperation...|$|R

The {{study was designed to}} investigate the use of 3 D ocean waves as a metaphor for visualizing real-time web traffic. In this display twenty levels of web traffic were mapped to the frequency and turbulence of ocean waves. This report describes the various stages in the process used to develop the display and the various technical issues and risk confronted during development. It begins by describing the main business requirements, key design criteria and the data characterisation process used in the requirements gathering phase. It then describes the iterative prototyping stage of the project. This stage includes a description of the process followed for the 3 D model design, the scene rendering, the evaluation of display aesthetics, the final data mappings, the system implementation and testing of three prototypes. Finally, the in-situ deployment and evaluation stage of the display is described. Using a pre-existing framework, the key issues associate with ambient display development are categorised and discussed. This discussion reports on key <b>technology,</b> <b>deployment</b> issues, and <b>project</b> management concerns. More general issues related to orchestrating such ubiquitous experiences and deployment of Ambient Displays in public spaces are also recorded.

40|$|Industrial DSM {{programs}} cannot succeed unless customers {{learn about}} and implement new technologies {{in a timely}} manner. Why? Because this expeditious transfer of new technologies represents the key challenge for the 1990 s. This paper explores the viability of using technology application centers (TACs) to help utilities facilitate the diffusion of new technologies to customers. Technology represents a key component in integrating industrial customers' needs with utility objectives. A&C Enercom's approach to <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> seeks to blend an industrial customer's priorities with the utility's marketing and customer service objectives. A&C Enercom sees <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> as the sum of an equation: <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> equals <b>technology</b> transfer plus technology application. A&C Enercom has learned from experience that <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> will not occur unless utilities achieve both technology transfer (e. g, the dissemination of information) and technology application (e. g., the direct application of electrotechnologies to a customer's processes and systems). TACs represent a key tool that will help utilities meet the <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> challenge. A TAC's focus is to serve customers. It should house all <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> components and represent the platform from which all services are offered to the industrial customer.

40|$|Mobile {{technology}} is a {{next step in the}} expansion of opportunities made available by information technology (IT). It remains questionable as to whether mobile technology differs from fixed networks and stationary IT, while the role of mobile <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> in service innovation practices still needs to be established. In this thesis service innovation practices and mobile <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> are studied in a creative industry setting – in-depth interviews with 31 SME managers are analysed using a grounded theory approach. A capability approach, wherein capabilities imply a use-in-practice analysis of a firm’s assets and competences deployment, assists in conceptualising the process of mobile <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> and understanding qualitative results. As a result, this study concludes that accessing or acquiring mobile technology resources and developing mobile technology capabilities underpin mobile <b>technology</b> <b>deployment.</b> Primarily, this thesis’s main theoretical contribution is in introducing and defining a new concept named ‘mobile technology capabilities’, namely a firm’s unique practices employed in orchestrating mobile technology resources to create a competitive advantage. Mobile technology capabilities consist of five distinct practices that firms perform to combine and integrate mobile technology resources into organisational processes, namely learning, leading, transforming, leveraging mobile technology resources and solving problems. Moreover, this study concludes that interaction between mobile technology resources and mobile technology capabilities stimulates and facilitates both process and product service innovation practices, where organisational commitment towards mobile <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> determine the innovation practices with which a firm is going to engage. Hence, three clusters of creative service SMEs were identified in this study, which reflect on diverse practices of mobile <b>technology</b> <b>deployment.</b> The understanding of mobile <b>technology</b> <b>deployment</b> process that derives from this thesis is particularly significant in showing SMEs’ managers the real value in embracing mobile technology...|$|R

40|$|The Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor (BGRR) Historical Site Assessment (BNL 1999) {{identified}} contamination {{inside the}} Below Grade Ducts (BGD) {{resulting from the}} deposition of fission and activation products from the pile on the inner carbon steel liner during reactor operations. Due to partial flooding of the BGD since shutdown, some of this contamination may have leaked out of the ducts into the surrounding soils. The baseline remediation plan for cleanup of contaminated soils beneath the BGD involves complete removal of the ducts, followed by surveying the underlying and surrounding soils, then removing soil that has been contaminated above cleanup goals. Alternatively, if soil contamination around and beneath the BGD is either non-existent/minimal (below cleanup goals) or is very localized and can be ''surgically removed'' at a reasonable cost, the BGD can be decontaminated and left in place. The focus of this Department of Energy Accelerated Site <b>Technology</b> <b>Deployment</b> (DOE ASTD) <b>project</b> {{was to determine the}} extent (location, type, and level) of soil contamination surrounding the BGD and to present this data to the stakeholders as part of the Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis (EE/CA) process.
