5|$|Local {{shipping}} {{accidents are}} among {{the responsibilities of the}} Phoenix. In September 1965, the Norwegian freighter MS Berganger collided with the tanker Independent, resulting in fires aboard the ships. Phoenix responded along with U.S. Coast Guard fireboats to quickly put out the freighter's blaze, but the tanker took longer to extinguish. A year later, a gasoline barge collided with rocks near the shore. While Phoenix and the Coast Guard were investigating, the barge exploded killing two Coast Guardsmen and one nearby workman. Phoenix rescued a third Coast Guardsman with severe injuries, and fought <b>to</b> <b>snuff</b> the blaze. Flaming, floating gasoline proved difficult to subdue. In December 2011, a tourist DUKW boat suffered an engine fire while in McCovey Cove, and Phoenix doused the flames while the Coast Guard rescued the passengers and crew.|$|E
5|$|Over Romney Marsh Nos. 41, 92 and 222 Squadrons engaged JG 26, {{losing one}} of their number to the Bf 109s. The second wave of RAF fighters arrived on the scene, {{comprising}} 607 and 213 Squadrons with 23 Hurricanes. They initiated a head-on attack against the Do 17s of KG 3. A Hurricane and a Dornier collided, both going down. The Bf 109s {{did their best to}} break up attacks and the bombers held a tight formation, putting up withering cross-fire. The Bf 109s were not permitted to leave the bombers and chase enemy fighters. Time and again, they were forced to break off and return to the bomber stream, allowing the RAF fighters to return and repeat the process. Soon after, No. 605 and No. 501 Squadron arrived with 14 Hurricanes. One fighter was hit by return fire, but the pilot aimed his aircraft at a Dornier and bailed out. The fighter collided and destroyed the bomber. The German bomber crews {{had no way of knowing}} that the crashes were not premeditated. It seemed as if the British were desperate. Nevertheless, they thought the 'tactic' was devastatingly effective. Chastened by losses, the Dorniers closed ranks <b>to</b> <b>snuff</b> out the gaps and continued to their target.|$|E

500|$|As {{their former}} cinematographer, Climati drew {{influence}} from the Mondo films of Gualtiero Jacopetti and Franco Prosperi. The cinéma vérité styled camera work used in Ultime grida dalla savana was previously used in Africa addio {{in a scene}} in which the film crew is nearly killed during an uprising in newly independent Ethiopia. The inclusion of lingering Technicolor shots and violence towards animals is also a feature of Jacopetti's Mondo cane series. Some scenes were also directly lifted from Africa addio and reused in Ultime grida dalla savana. David Kerekes and David Slater, authors of Killing for Culture: An Illustrated History of Death Film from Mondo <b>to</b> <b>Snuff,</b> also note that, [...] "Savage Man Savage Beast is a slight return to the more encyclopaedic world view of mondo cinema which was prevalent in the 60s," [...] demonstrating Climati's early roots in Mondo cinema.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{successful}} new French work that first season was Felicien David's La perle du Brésil, first performed on 22 November.

2500|$|The January 1947 {{elections}} {{held under}} the supervision of the PPR fell well short of being [...] "free and unfettered." [...] The PPR, under the leadership of general secretary Władysław Gomułka, embarked on a ruthless campaign <b>to</b> <b>snuff</b> out the PSL and all other potential opposition. electoral laws introduced before the elections allowed the government [...] which since its establishment in 1944 by the Polish Committee of National Liberation had been dominated by the Communists [...] to remove over half a million people from the electoral rolls, under false accusations of collaboration with the Nazis or 'anti-government bandits' (i.e., Armia Krajowa and other Polish resistance movements loyal to the Polish government in exile). Over 80,000 members of the Polish People's Party were arrested under various false charges in the month preceding the election, and around 100 of them were murdered by the Polish Secret Police (Urząd Bezpieczeństwa, UB). 98 opposition parliamentary candidates were also crossed from the registration lists under these accusations. In some regions the government disqualified the entire People's Party list under various technical and legal pretenses, most commonly in regions known to be People's Party strongholds.|$|E

[...] "We'll be carrying out surprise actions throughout the city of Buenos Aires, but all of these will be peaceful." [...] Among other activities, protesters organized an alternative march that went from the Obelisk to the city hall, featuring their own [...] "Human Rights Torch." [...] A giant banner reading [...] "Free Tibet" [...] was also displayed on the torch route. According to a representative from the NGO 'Human Rights Torch Relay', their objective was to [...] "show the contradiction between the Olympic Games and the presence of widespread human rights violations in China" [...] The outreach director of HRTR, Susan Prager, is also the communication director of [...] "Friends of Falun Gong", a quasi-government non-profit funded by fmr. Congressman Tom Lanto's wife and Ambassador Mark Palmer of NED. A major setback to the event was caused by footballer Diego Maradona, scheduled to open the relay through Buenos Aires, pulling out in an attempt to avoid the Olympic controversy. Trying to avoid the scenes that marred the relay in the UK, France and the US, the city government designed a complex security operative to protect the torch relay, involving 1200 police officers and 3000 other people, including public employees and volunteers. Overall, the protests were peaceful in nature, although there were a few incidents such as the throwing of several water balloons in an attempt to extinguish the Olympic flame, and minor scuffles between Olympic protesters and supporters from Chinese immigrant communities.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{rehabilitation}} cell, Zelena reads [...] "Hansel and Gretel" [...] to her unborn child, {{before going into}} pain, screaming and banging on the door. Regina and Robin show up and they look at her pregnant body, which has accelerated by seven months (from two months), a result of Emma's dark magic. Zelena is {{rushed to the hospital}} and says that Emma did this with her onion rings. Dr. Whale is there and Zelena says tells him to get her [...] "angry baby" [...] out, and Whale reminds her about the last baby he delivered, which she tried to steal. He then mocks her, telling her that she must have realized that having a baby was so much more fun than stealing one. Regina asks why his hair is blonde and spiked, with Dr. Whale replying that since Emma changed her hairstyle, he though he could do the same as well. As Dr. Whale continues to joke about Zelena, Regina mutters that they [...] "really need a new doctor in this town." [...] Belle and Mary Margaret rush in and tell them that Emma is coming for the baby, and that the only thing she needs other than Excalibur <b>to</b> <b>snuff</b> out the light are the cries of a newborn child.

Robin and Regina prepare to fight her, but Emma reveals that she wants Zelena instead, and disappears with her.|$|E
2500|$|It is the Soviet Union {{that runs}} against {{the tide of}} history by denying human freedom and human dignity to its citizens. It also is in deep {{economic}} difficulty. The rate {{of growth in the}} national product has been steadily declining since the fifties and is less than half of what it was then. The dimensions of this failure are astounding: A country which employs one-fifth of its population in agriculture is unable to feed its own people. Were it not for the private sector, the tiny private sector tolerated in Soviet agriculture, the country might be on the brink of famine.... Overcentralized, with little or no incentives, year after year the Soviet system pours its best resource into the making of instruments of destruction. The constant shrinkage of economic growth combined with the growth of military production is putting a heavy strain on the Soviet people. What we see here is a political structure that no longer corresponds to its economic base, a society where productive forces are hampered by political ones. ...In the Communist world as well, man's instinctive desire for freedom and self-determination surfaces again and again. To be sure, there are grim reminders of how brutally the police state attempts <b>to</b> <b>snuff</b> out this quest for self-rule – 1953 in East Germany, 1956 in Hungary, 1968 in Czechoslovakia, 1981 in Poland. But the struggle continues in Poland. And {{we know that there are}} even those who strive and suffer for freedom within the confines of the Soviet Union itself. ...What I am describing now is a plan and a hope for the long term – the march of freedom and democracy which will leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash heap of history as it has left other tyrannies which stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-expression of the people. And that's why we must continue our efforts to strengthen NATO even as we move forward with our Zero-Option initiative in the negotiations on intermediate-range forces and our proposal for a one-third reduction in strategic ballistic missile warheads." ...|$|E
