5|$|A central {{character}} of the epic, King Pandu, who is cursed to die upon having sex with his wife, convinces his wife Kunti to have niyoga with the gods and mother children for him, citing <b>the</b> <b>example</b> of Kalmashapada. The scholar Meyer suggests that the tale of Pandu may be inspired by the much older narrative of Kalmashapada.|$|E
5|$|According to Pauling's first rule, {{successive}} pK {{values of}} a given acid increase (pKa2 > pKa1). For oxyacids {{with more than one}} ionizable hydrogen on the same atom, the pKa values often increase by about 5 units for each proton removed, as in <b>the</b> <b>example</b> of phosphoric acid above.|$|E

5|$|During the campaign, Corzine {{refused to}} release his {{income tax return}} records. He claimed an {{interest}} in doing so, but he cited a confidentiality agreement with Goldman Sachs.

5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>example</b> of de Gaulle, {{who refused}} {{proposals}} for an integrated Europe, Houphouët-Boigny opposed Nkrumah's proposed United States of Africa, which {{called into question}} Côte d'Ivoire's recently acquired national sovereignty.

5|$|For {{addition}} of sulfur ylides to enones, higher 1,4-selectivity is typically obtained with sulfoxonium reagents than with sulfonium reagents. Many electron-withdrawing {{groups have been}} shown compatible with the reaction including ketones, esters, and amides (<b>the</b> <b>example</b> below involves a Weinreb amide). With further conjugated systems 1,6-addition tends to predominate over 1,4-addition.|$|E

30|$|We {{would like}} to stress that (M_X, d_L) becomes non-separable even when X are the above {{elementary}} cases. We note that the non-separability of <b>the</b> first <b>example</b> follows from <b>the</b> non-separability of <b>the</b> second <b>example.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>example,</b> however, is easier to show the non-separability than <b>the</b> second <b>example.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>example</b> {{at right}} shows a {{potential}} implementation of an aspect which logs the entry and exit of all methods.

5|$|There is a socio-political {{cycle of}} order and {{disorder}} where, regardless of who is in power, the same injustices take place: when the blacks take control, they betray their own traditions and follow <b>the</b> <b>example</b> of European states.

5|$|Antibiotic drug {{design is}} {{facilitated}} when an enzyme {{that is essential}} to the pathogen's survival is absent or very different in humans. In <b>the</b> <b>example</b> above, humans do not make peptidoglycan, therefore inhibitors of this process are selectively toxic to bacteria. Selective toxicity is also produced in antibiotics by exploiting differences {{in the structure of the}} ribosomes in bacteria, or how they make fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|Coherent {{units are}} derived units that contain no {{numerical}} factor other than 1—quantities such as standard gravity and density of water are absent from their definitions. In <b>the</b> <b>example</b> above, one newton is the force required to accelerate {{a mass of}} one kilogram by one metre per second squared. Since the SI units of mass and acceleration are kg and m·s−2 respectively and , the units of force (and hence of newtons) is formed by multiplication to give kg·m·s−2. Since the newton {{is part of a}} coherent set of units, the constant of proportionality is 1.|$|E

30|$|Although <b>the</b> system {{presents}} <b>examples</b> to {{learners and}} prompts them {{to compare the}} base with their posed problems, it does not give any {{instructions on how to}} learn from <b>the</b> <b>examples.</b> <b>The</b> <b>examples</b> are merely shown to the learners.

For learners to adequately study <b>the</b> solutions from <b>examples</b> and transfer that knowledge to their problem posing, further support must be introduced.
