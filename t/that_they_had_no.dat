5|$|At the 2001 census, 16.3% of the {{population}} of Middlewich either did not answer the question about religion, or stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> religion. The breakdown for Congleton showed that 99.3% of those that replied, and did not state <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> religion, were Christian; the figures for Middlewich will be broadly similar.|$|E

5|$|On March 20, 2009, Dave Holloway transported {{a search}} dog to Aruba to search a small {{reservoir}} {{in the northern}} part of the island. The reservoir was previously identified by a supposed witness as a possible location of Natalee's remains. Aruban authorities indicated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> new information in the case, but that Holloway had been given permission to conduct the search.|$|E
5|$|A capable preacher, though {{doubtful}} of {{his ability}} when preaching to a non-academic congregation, Chadwick was well regarded as a lecturer and companion at High Table. However, a natural shyness could give him a rather remote air. On an American lecture tour, he noticed three young women who came to every lecture, but took no notes. At the end of lectures he asked the women how they had enjoyed them, to be told <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> real {{interest in the subject}} itself, but they loved to hear him speak. The character of the college provost in the A Staircase in Surrey novels of Christ Church colleague J. I. M. Stewart was based on that of Chadwick.|$|E

5|$|American {{journalist}} H. R. Knickerbocker, who had met both Hitler and Hess, {{speculated that}} Hitler had sent Hess {{to deliver a}} message informing Winston Churchill of the forthcoming invasion of the Soviet Union, and offering a negotiated peace or even an anti-Bolshevik partnership. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin believed that Hess's flight had been engineered by the British. Stalin persisted in this belief as late as 1944, when he mentioned the matter to Churchill, who insisted <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> advance knowledge of the flight.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the 2001 Census, 42% of the {{population}} identified themselves as being affiliated with the Church of Scotland, with 13% Roman Catholic and 28% with other Christian churches. Many of this last group belong to the Free Church of Scotland, known for its strict observance of the Sabbath. 11% stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> religion. This made the Western Isles the Scottish council area with the smallest percentage of atheists in the population. There are also small Episcopalian congregations in Lewis and Harris and the Outer Hebrides are part of the Diocese of Argyll and The Isles in both the Episcopalian and Catholic traditions.|$|E
5|$|Between 9:00am and 11:00am, about 100,000people {{gathered}} on the Adam Mickiewicz Square {{in front of the}} Imperial Castle in Poznań, surrounded by buildings occupied by the city and Party authorities and police headquarters. The demonstrators demanded lower food prices, wage increases and the revocation of some recent changes in the law that had eroded workers' conditions. They further requested a visit from Polish Prime Minister Józef Cyrankiewicz, as the local government declared <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> authority to solve the problems. Some police officers also joined the crowd.|$|E

5|$|In 1996 NSB Gardermoen {{stated that}} they {{expected}} to charge commuter and intercity trains 100 million Norwegian krone per year {{to use the new}} line. County politicians in Akershus stated that it was not reasonable for commuters to {{have to pay for the}} new railway. Early estimates showed that this would almost double to price from Oslo to Eidsvoll, and that passengers would have different prices, depending on which route they followed. Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk, which was responsible for buses in Akershus, stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> way to influence NSB's prices, but that they would consider starting a coach service along the route, which would not charge the surcharge.|$|E
5|$|In August 2009, {{following}} {{a visit to}} Cambois from Minister of State for Energy at the Department of Energy and Climate Change Joan Ruddock, {{it was revealed that}} the government were determined to go ahead with four new coal-fired power stations. She stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> scepticism about CCS technology, with a competition having been started between the big energy companies to create a viable form of the technology, set to end in 2014. However this meant the station may not have been completed until 2020.|$|E
5|$|In early 1996, the Hunter Mariners {{club was}} officially launched, without a home ground, {{but on that}} same day the Super League was banned from running its rebel competition. Originally the Mariners were allowed to use the Newcastle Knights home ground Marathon Stadium by the Showground Trust, but the Supreme Court found <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> rights to play there. The club {{eventually}} played at Topper Stadium, sharing {{the ground with the}} National Soccer League's Newcastle Breakers, and used over $1 million to upgrade facilities at the stadium. After an appeal in mid-1996, the Super League was officially allowed to run the competition, which began in 1997.|$|E

5|$|In early November 2008, the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, at an {{informal}} lunch with foreign diplomats, criticized Iceland's traditional friends (particularly Britain, Sweden and Denmark) {{as well as}} the International Monetary Fund. According to a memo from the Norwegian embassy, he suggested that the Russians might want to use the Keflavík Air Base, the Russian ambassador replied <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> need for it. The President is quoted to have said that Iceland would soon recover, even if they had to fight alone. The President does not necessarily agree with the government on these issues.|$|E
5|$|In the 2001 census 83.06% of {{respondents}} in Wyre gave their religion as Christianity. This {{is higher than}} the average for the North West (78.01%) and England (71.74).

5|$|Initial {{reports said}} that she had been killed by an {{explosion}} set off by one of her captors. A joint official investigation by the United Kingdom and the United States later concluded that her fatal injuries were inflicted by a grenade thrown by one of her rescuers. A February 2011 coroner's narrative verdict reported that Norgrove died during the failed rescue attempt. In October 2012, one of her colleagues {{said in an interview that}} the captors had told Norgrove <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> intention of killing her.|$|E

5|$|Reactions from bobsledders {{about the}} track during the two-man event varied from {{exciting}} to anxious to dangerous. The Associated Press spoke to 13 of the 21 drivers who competed at the two-woman event on 23–24 February 2010 {{and the only}} one who did not feel safe on the track was Erin Pac of the United States. The three German drivers who competed in the two-woman event stated through a team spokeswoman <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> safety concerns about the track.|$|E
5|$|Umar, {{apparently}} {{wanting to}} defeat the Byzantines first, employed the best Muslim troops against them. The continuing stream of Muslim reinforcements worried the Byzantines, who fearing that the Muslims with such reinforcements would grow powerful, decided <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> choice but to attack. The reinforcements that {{were sent to the}} Muslims at Yarmouk arrived in small bands, giving the impression of a continuous stream of reinforcements, in order to demoralize the Byzantines and compel them to attack. The same tactic would be repeated again during the Battle of Qadisiyah.|$|E
