Aside from Chandler's anecdote, which he frequently repeated after the 1972 interview, {{there is no evidence that}} his meeting with Rickey ever took place. Nevertheless, future baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn and Washington Post sportswriter Bob Addie maintained that Robinson would not have played had it not been for Chandler's intervention.|$|E
5|$|The early Ming {{court could}} not, and did not, aspire {{to the control}} imposed upon the Jurchens in Manchuria by the Mongols, yet it created a norm of {{organization}} that would ultimately serve as the principal vehicle for the relations with peoples along the northeast frontiers. By {{the end of the}} Hongwu reign, <b>the</b> <b>essentials</b> of a policy toward the Jurchens had taken shape. Most of the inhabitants of Manchuria, except for the wild Jurchens, were at peace with China. The Ming had created many guards (衛, wei) in Manchuria, but the creation of a guard did not necessarily imply political control. In 1409, the Ming dynasty under Yongle Emperor established the Nurgan Regional Military Commission {{on the banks of the}} Amur River, and Yishiha, a eunuch of Haixi Jurchen derivation, was ordered to lead an expedition to the mouth of the Amur to pacify the Wild Jurchens. After the death of Yongle Emperor, the Nurgan Regional Military Commission was abolished in 1435, and the Ming court ceased to have substantial activities there, although the guards continued to exist in Manchuria. By the late Ming period, Ming political presence in Manchuria had waned considerably.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the chemical composition of <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> oil of Artemisia vestita and to determine the antibacterial activity of <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> oil and its two major components, grandisol and 1, 8 -cineole, against certain respiratory infection-causing bacterial strains, in vitro and in vivo. The chemical composition of <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> oil was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A micro-well dilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values of <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> oil and its major constituents. A model of Streptococcus pyogenes infection in mice was used to determine its in vivo activities. Lung and blood samples were obtained to assess bacterial cell counts. Toxicity evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> oil and its components was completed by performing biochemical analysis of the serum, particularly monitoring aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, urea and creatinine. <b>The</b> <b>essential</b> oil exhibited potent anti-bacterial activity, whereas the two major constituents were less potent. <b>The</b> <b>essential</b> oil exhibited MIC values between 20 and 80 µg/ml, while the values of the two constituents were between 130 and 200 µg/ml. Scanning electron microscopy results demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> oil inhibited biofilm formation and altered its architecture. Survival curves indi-cated that <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> oil led to a reduction in the viability of different bacteria. <b>The</b> <b>essential</b> oil also induced significant leakage of potassium ions from S. pyogenes. <b>The</b> <b>essential</b> oil (100 µg/mouse) and grandisol (135 µg/mouse) significantly reduced the number of viable bacterial cells in the lungs (P< 0. 01). However, intake of 100 µg/mouse of essential oil or grandisol 135 µg/mouse once or twice each day for 9 days did not produce any toxic effects in the mice. In conclusion, the in vitro and in vivo results suggested that <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> oil of A. vestita and one of its major constituents, grandisol, can significantly inhibit the growth of different bacterial strains...|$|R
