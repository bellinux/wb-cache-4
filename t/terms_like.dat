5|$|By the 1960s, {{the term}} {{rhythm and blues}} had no longer been in wide use; instead, <b>terms</b> <b>like</b> soul music were used to {{describe}} popular music by black artists. In the 1980s, however, rhythm and blues came back into use, most often {{in the form of}} R, a usage that has continued to the present. Contemporary R arose when sultry funk singers like Prince became very popular, alongside dance-oriented pop stars like Michael Jackson and Madonna.|$|E

This statement resembles {{the income statement}} of a business, but may use <b>terms</b> <b>like</b> excess or deficit rather than profit or loss. It shows the net results, by each fund, of the organization's activities during the fiscal year reported. The excess or deficit is shown as a change in fund balances, simpler to an increase or decrease in owner's equity.|$|E

5|$|Description of {{an early}} form of yoga called nirodhayoga (yoga of cessation) is {{contained}} in the Mokshadharma section of the 12th chapter (Shanti Parva) of the Mahabharata. The verses of the section are dated to c. 300–200 BCE. Nirodhayoga emphasizes progressive withdrawal from the contents of empirical consciousness such as thoughts, sensations etc. until purusha (Self) is realized. <b>Terms</b> <b>like</b> vichara (subtle reflection), viveka (discrimination) and others which are similar to Patanjali's terminology are mentioned, but not described. There is no uniform goal of yoga mentioned in the Mahabharata. Separation of self from matter, perceiving Brahman everywhere, entering into Brahman etc. are all described as goals of yoga. Samkhya and yoga are conflated together and some verses describe them as being identical. Mokshadharma also describes an early practice of elemental meditation.|$|E
5|$|After {{the medieval}} period, the word elf tended to become less common {{throughout}} the Germanic languages, losing out to alternative native <b>terms</b> <b>like</b> zwerc ("dwarf") in German and huldra ("hidden being") in Scandinavian languages, and to loan-words like fairy (borrowed from French {{into all the}} Germanic languages). Still, beliefs in elves persisted in the early modern period, particularly in Scotland and Scandinavia, where elves were thought of as magically powerful people living, usually invisibly, alongside everyday human communities. They continued {{to be associated with}} causing illness and with sexual threats. For example, a number of early modern ballads in the British Isles and Scandinavia, originating in the medieval period, describe elves attempting to seduce or abduct human characters. With urbanisation and industrialisation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, beliefs in elves declined rapidly (though Iceland has some claim to continued popular belief in elves). However, from the early modern period onwards, elves started to be prominent in the literature and art of educated elites. These literary elves were imagined as small, impish beings, with Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream being a key development of this idea. In the eighteenth century, German Romanticist writers were influenced by this notion of the elf, and reimported the English word elf into the German language.|$|E

25|$|To label this process, {{apart from}} the word interbreeding/hybridization, also <b>terms</b> <b>like</b> {{dilution}} of the dingoes or weakening of the genetic line are in usage. Even in the scientific area the process was called a sort of genetic pollution (itself a controversial term).|$|E
25|$|Although modern archaeologists {{realize that}} this {{tripartite}} division of prehistoric society is far too simple to reflect the complexity of change and continuity, <b>terms</b> <b>like</b> ‘Bronze Age’ are still used as a very general way of focusing attention on particular times and places and thus facilitating archaeological discussion.|$|E
25|$|When {{paleontology}} uncovered {{three million}} years' worth of human generations, making it untenable that humanity, agriculture, and civilization all began {{at roughly the}} same time, our worldview was still not affected.

25|$|A century later, the {{differences}} between Gallaeci and Suebi people had faded, leading to the systematic use of <b>terms</b> <b>like</b> Galliciense Regnum (Galician Kingdom), Regem Galliciae (King of Galicia), Rege Suevorum (King of Suebi), and Galleciae totius provinciae rex (king of all Galician provinces), while bishops, such as Martin of Braga, were recognized as episcopi Gallaecia (Bishop of Galicia).|$|E
25|$|The Christian {{censorship}} of the Jewish Talmud {{in the aftermath}} of the Disputation of Barcelona and during the Spanish Inquisition and Roman Inquisition, let the term spread within the Jewish classical texts, since Roman Catholic Church censors replaced <b>terms</b> <b>like</b> Minim ("sectarians", coined on the Christians) with the term Epikorsim or Epicursim, meaning heretics.|$|E
25|$|While Laplace's {{version of}} {{determinism}} {{is based on}} general terms, Boscovich's uses physical <b>terms,</b> <b>like</b> position, velocity, direction and centre of mass. Boscovich also (correctly) suggests that the continuity of force is a necessary assumption for determinism, and he presented it in strict mathematical form. In short, Boskovich's determinism is more physical, while Laplace's determinism is more metaphysical, placing it in harmony with Leibniz's metaphysics.|$|E

Yggdrasil ("Yggr's horse") was the yew or ash tree from which Odin sacrificed himself, and which {{connected}} the nine worlds. Jakob Grimm connects the name Irmin with Old Norse <b>terms</b> <b>like</b> iörmungrund ("great ground", i.e. the Earth) or iörmungandr ("great snake", i.e. the Midgard serpent).|$|E
25|$|Indigenous {{cultures}} {{of the people who}} inhabited the continent prior to European Colonization. Ancient and very advanced civilizations developed their own political, social and religious systems. The Mayas, the Aztecs and the Incas are examples of these.

50|$|Unlike {{terms are}} {{two or more}} terms that are not <b>like</b> <b>terms,</b> i.e. {{they do not have}} the same {{variables}} or powers. The order of the variables does not matter unless there is a power. For example, 8xyz2 and &minus;5xyz2 are <b>like</b> <b>terms</b> because they have the same variables and power while 3abc and 3ghi are unlike terms because they have different variables. Since the coefficient doesn't affect likeness, all constant <b>terms</b> are <b>like</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|R

Many organizations have made efforts to use gender-neutral terms when referring to perpetration and victimization. For example, using broader <b>terms</b> <b>like</b> family violence rather than violence against women.|$|E
