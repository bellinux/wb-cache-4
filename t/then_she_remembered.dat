60|$|Martha {{was puzzled}} {{and shook her}} head, thoughtfully. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> something.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> him, {{and took}} him with her into the castle.|$|E
6000|$|And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> a crowd {{near her}} father's house, {{out of which}} her father came smiling pleasantly on her, but not interfering with her triumphal {{progress}} until the leader finally deposited her in her mother's lap in their own sitting-room. And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> being [...] "cross," [...] and declining to answer any questions, and shortly afterwards found herself comfortably in bed. Then she heard her mother say to her father:-- ...|$|E
60|$|APRIL 6. Certainly <b>she</b> <b>remembers</b> the past. Lynch {{says all}} women do. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembers</b> {{the time of}} her childhood--and mine, if I was ever a child. The past is {{consumed}} in the present and the present is living only because it brings forth the future. Statues of women, if Lynch be right, should always be fully draped, one hand of the woman feeling regretfully her own hinder parts.|$|R
60|$|So Margaret spoke, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> sighed, <b>remembering</b> {{the reason}} why she should not attend soap-bubble parties.|$|R
60|$|She {{had already}} begun to button her gloves, and to {{readjust}} her feather boa with which she had been knocking the Easter cards off the counter. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> suddenly <b>remembered</b> something.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think she}} {{recovered}} consciousness for two days, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> nothing. What {{do you think}} {{are the chances of}} her remembering now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The Princess was so rejoiced {{to be free}} {{that she}} danced and sang, but <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> her sisters, and said: 'If my sisters were but free too!' ...|$|E
60|$|Something flicked at {{the back}} of Sally's mind. She seemed to have been through all this before. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembered.</b> This was simply Mr. Reginald Cracknell over again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'By no means,' she said, with a courteous air; and <b>then,</b> <b>remembering</b> <b>she</b> was a hostess, 'Is there {{anything}} that you require?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Betty {{had seen}} the Colonel angry more than once, but never with her. It was quite certain she had angered him and she forgot her own resentment. Her heart had warmed with her brother's praise of Clarke. <b>Then</b> as <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> the past <b>she</b> felt a scorn for her {{weakness}} and such a revulsion of feeling that she cried out passionately: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall we go {{and look}} at the aviary?" [...] said Mr. Magnet, {{reverting}} to a favourite idea of his, and <b>then</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>she</b> did not like to see caged birds.|$|R
60|$|She gasped, {{and began}} to sink back again with joy and weakness, whereon he cast his arms about her and drew her to his breast. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> everything.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not {{the least}} bit afraid," [...] she answered. [...] "Oh Tommy, if you knew how manly----" [...] And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> that she had said that already.|$|E
60|$|Elsie {{noted that}} he had shown no surprise, which was curious, {{and that he was}} very cool. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> that he had not been looking well for some days.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the story}} [...] "The Good Old Daze" [...] by Tony Strobl, Grandpa Duck (an older Humperdink) appears in {{flashback}} {{taking care of}} little Donald along with Grandma. He's portrayed as a dedicated but rigorous grandfather. Grandpa's real name wasn't revealed in this story, but in an untitled one from 1951, where an old lover of Grandma called Humperdink has a cameo appearance. Don Rosa considered that this character became Donald's grandfather. In this same story, Grandma remembers an occasion where she and Humperdink heard {{one of her favorite}} songs. She says to herself, [...] "I remember the band played that for Humperdink and me at the Fish Peddler's Picnic in 1905!". Besides, Grandma finds the ruined coat Humperdink had used to let her not step on a mud puddle and some romantic letters addressed to her written by Humperdink. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembers</b> some sweet names Humperdink used to refer to her in those letters.|$|R
60|$|Ruth felt baffled and {{inclined}} to be angry. She had had impecunious admirers who did not consider her father’s money a disadvantage. Jimmy’s was, of course, a more becoming attitude, but she thought he adhered to it too firmly. <b>Then,</b> as <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> his worn look and his threadbare clothes when she met him in Vancouver, she was moved to pity. The trouble was {{that it could not}} be shown. She could not offer him sympathy which he did not seem to want.|$|R
50|$|She {{has been}} searching for over 24 hours and still had not found X. As it is getting darker, she sees {{all of these people}} in costumes. <b>She</b> <b>then</b> <b>remembers</b> that it is Halloween talks about how much Tammy loves Halloween.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish," [...] Katharine started, {{with great}} impetuosity, and checked herself. Her mother always stirred her to feel and think quickly, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> {{that her father}} was there, {{listening}} with attention.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> Monte Carlo, and for {{a moment}} it was to her as {{shocking}} a warning {{as if she had been}} bidden to keep her husband out of the temptation of thieving.|$|E
6000|$|... "You do that." [...] <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> {{that the}} man was a lord. [...] "I ought to have said 'my lord,'" [...] she said; [...] "but I forgot. I hope you'll excuse me--my lord." ...|$|E
5000|$|With Miss Rice also dead, Esther has {{no place}} to turn to and again takes on any menial work she can get hold of. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembers</b> Mrs Barfield, {{contacts}} her and, when asked to come to Woodview as her servant, gladly accepts while Jack, now old enough to earn his own living, stays behind in London. When she arrives there, Esther finds the once proud estate {{in a state of}} absolute disrepair, with Mrs Barfield the only inhabitant. Mistress and maid develop an increasingly intimate relationship with each other and, {{for the first time in}} their lives, can practise their religion unhindered. Looking back on her [...] "life of trouble and strife," [...] Esther, now about 40, says she has been able to fulfil her task—to see her boy [...] "settled in life," [...] and thus does not see any reason whatsoever to want to get married again. In the final scene of the novel, Jack, who has become a soldier, visits the two women at Woodview.|$|R
60|$|All at {{once she}} {{reached the end of}} the street. On each side the wall of lighted tents and houses ceased. Had she missed her way--gone down a side street to the edge of the desert? No. The rows of lights behind assured her this was the main street. Yet she was far from the {{railroad}} station. The crowds of men hurried by, as always. Before her reached a leveled space, dimly lighted, full of moving objects, and noise of hammers and wagons, and harsh voices. <b>Then</b> suddenly <b>she</b> <b>remembered.</b>|$|R
60|$|After cautioning the Monkey and Bear and Owl {{to behave}} {{themselves}} during the night, {{she picked up}} the cage containing the Canary and, going to the door of her bedroom, commanded it to open. Just <b>then,</b> however, <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>she</b> had left her fiddle lying upon a table, so she went back for it and put it away in the cupboard, and while her back was turned the Green Monkey slipped through the open door into her bedroom and hid underneath the bed. The Giantess, being sleepy, did not notice this, and entering her room she made the door close behind her and then hung the bird-cage on a peg by the window. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> began to undress, first taking off the lace apron and laying it over the bedpost, where it was within easy reach of her hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor papa!" [...] <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> herself, {{and spoke}} with a little start. [...] "Of course I am not {{thinking}} of myself. Arranging a marriage {{is very different from}} preventing any one from marrying." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never can}} get up there without wings," [...] said May, {{as she looked at}} the high rocks with a tangle of vines all over them. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> what the brook told her, and called out,-- ...|$|E
60|$|She {{looked around}} {{in vain for}} the horse spoken of by Pawnee Brown. Not an animal was in sight. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> what the scout had said about riding down the ravine, and she set off on foot.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> {{happened}} to <b>remember</b> {{that in a}} corner of her suit-case were one or two crackers that were left over from her luncheon on the train, and she went to the buggy and brought them. Eureka stuck up her nose at such food, but the tiny piglets squealed delightedly {{at the sight of the}} crackers and ate them up in a jiffy.|$|R
6000|$|After the lapse of a {{few minutes}} the old {{housekeeper}} plods upstairs and delivers John's message. Anne, finding it altogether incomprehensible, subjects the poor dame to severe examination, but fails to elicit anything further. What is the meaning of it? What [...] "business" [...] can have compelled John, who for ten weeks has never let the word escape his lips, to leave her like this--without a word! without a kiss! <b>Then</b> suddenly <b>she</b> <b>remembers</b> the incident {{of a few}} moments ago, when she had called to him, thinking she saw him, and he did not answer; and the whole truth strikes her full in the heart.|$|R
60|$|John {{had reached}} the bay at half-past eight, and had been on guard there ever since. It was now past ten, but still {{there were no signs}} of Betty. His {{depression}} increased. He told himself that <b>she</b> had forgotten. <b>Then,</b> that <b>she</b> had <b>remembered,</b> but had changed her mind. <b>Then,</b> that <b>she</b> had never meant to come at all. He could not decide which of the three theories was the most distressing.|$|R
60|$|His eyes closed, and {{he slept}} more soundly, though his muttering continued. She {{had heard of}} {{congestion}} of the brain, and was frightened. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> his telling her of the ice Billy Murphy had held against his head.|$|E
60|$|Down the hill, on the {{far side}} of the track, she {{perceived}} the two men approaching with a horse; <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> the fact that she had been thrown, and that it was her horse. She rose to her feet.|$|E
6000|$|She {{could only}} {{make up her}} tale to twelve. She became perplexed. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembered.</b> [...] "Of course!" [...] she cried: [...] "there was Nicodemus. He was still-born. I always forget Nicodemus, poor little chap! But he came--was it sixth or seventh?--seventh after Anna." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{wondered}} if the unrest and strife that had lately come to the little village of Cottonwoods was to involve her. And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> sighed, <b>remembering</b> {{that her father had}} founded this remotest border settlement of southern Utah and that he had left it to her. She owned all the ground and many of the cottages. Withersteen House was hers, and the great ranch, with its thousands of cattle, and the swiftest horses of the sage. To her belonged Amber Spring, the water which gave verdure and beauty to the village and made living possible on that wild purple upland waste. She could not escape being involved by whatever befell Cottonwoods.|$|R
6000|$|... "That will do, that's {{speaking}} out," [...] she said. [...] "But--oh my! {{you put it}} a deal too mildly, sir, {{when you}} say the men don't seem to be on friendly terms together here. They hate each other. That's the word, Mr. Lefrank--hate; bitter, bitter, bitter hate!" [...] She clinched her little fists; she shook them vehemently, by way of adding emphasis to her last words; and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> suddenly <b>remembered</b> Ambrose. [...] "Except Ambrose," [...] she added, opening her hand again, and laying it very earnestly on my arm. [...] "Don't go and misjudge Ambrose, sir. There is no harm in poor Ambrose." ...|$|R
40|$|MSA {{speaks about}} her flight {{during the last}} months of the Second world war. She fled to a house in Oberer Berg, not far from Früchtenau, where she lived with her two daughters for a while. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> had to flee again and {{witnessed}} more cruelty and war crimes. MSA tells how she had to work with cattle for the Soviets in Unruhstadt (Kargowa, Poland) until the soldiers started raping the women again. She fled again and lived with two other women and children in a house in Früchtenau for a while. They were found by Soviet soldiers again and had to flee. MSA tells how she later worked for Poles and got sick. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>remembers</b> how they were earlier forced on a long march to work by Soviet soldiers. One soldier helped her and her sister-in-law to escape. They returned to their village and found some of their lost clothes. Then they had to work for the Poles. She had a very good relation with one of them. MSA tells how <b>she</b> got sick <b>then,</b> typhus. The Poles helped her to get to the hospital. Her family took care of her children. She speaks about the sad experiences in the hospital where she lost a lot of weight. Her sister-in-law had been raped by soldiers and died of syphilis in that time. MSA tells how she got better and travelled to Cottbus by train. She speaks about two rings that she gave her children on the way before they parted. Her family had to flee to Sielow earlier when she was still sick. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> went by foot from Cottbus to Sielow and reunited with her family...|$|R
