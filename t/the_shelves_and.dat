5|$|A toyline for {{the film}} was {{confirmed}} by Hasbro in February 2012. Despite the movie's release being moved from June 2012 to March 2013, the initial assortments of figures, vehicles, and role-play items were shipped to retailers, and appeared on store shelves in May 2012. A Variety article was published stating that the already released figures had been pulled from <b>the</b> <b>shelves</b> <b>and</b> recalled by Hasbro, although the company's official statement indicated that existing product would be sold through. New product shipments were halted by Hasbro, but existing Retaliation figures were available in Target, Wal-Mart, and Toys R Us as late as December 2012. The toyline was re-released in the United States in February 2013. A four-part limited series comic book titled G.I. Joe: Retaliation Movie Prequel was published by IDW Publishing from February 2012 to April 2012. Written by John Barber, it acted as a prequel to the 2013 movie.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, a {{photograph}} surfaced on Twitter {{showing that the}} Holborn Sainsbury's franchise responded to anti-Semitic threats by removing kosher products from its shelves. Complaints began appearing on social media that removing food {{that is consistent with}} Jewish dietary restrictions and is produced all over the world was an act of discrimination against Jews. In response to the negative publicity, the kosher products were restored to <b>the</b> <b>shelves</b> <b>and</b> the staffer who removed them was reprimanded. However, in a call by i24news correspondent Jonathan Sacerdoti to the Sainsbury's Careline, the Sainsbury's representative defended the store's actions, calling them prudent in the face of threatened obstruction to the store.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{creative}} boom while writing lyrics for the album, all {{three members of}} Blink-182 faced setbacks while recording Dude Ranch. DeLonge was having vocal problems and spent much time recording and re-recording vocal tracks, and Hoppus realized he too was having difficulty singing after losing his voice during a one-off Christmas concert. Forced to cancel the final week of recording in December 1996, Hoppus realized {{the magnitude of the}} situation and quit smoking in order {{to take care of his}} voice, which was stressed due to lack of vocal warm-ups, full days of vocal tracks, and the strain of singing for [...] "Dammit", which was accidentally written just outside Hoppus' vocal range. Meanwhile, Raynor had broken both heels and was in a wheelchair. Raynor was well enough to record the drum tracks for the album while on crutches. Aside from the recording, the band spent time playing Crash Bandicoot and [...] "reading the articles from <b>the</b> <b>shelves</b> <b>and</b> shelves of Playboys that the studio had thoughtfully provided." [...] The group ate lunch nearly each day at Sombrero, a local Mexican restaurant namedropped in [...] "Josie", and Chinese for dinner from Encinitas' Pick Up Stix.|$|E

2500|$|Nonetheless, {{for many}} years, comic book {{characters}} noticeably lacked {{racial and ethnic}} diversity. Comics writer and artist Kev F.

[...] Recognizing the influence of comics on popular culture, some members of ethnic and racial communities have focused their attention on stereotypes within comics, and have begun lobbying to change them. This is accomplished in many ways, frequently by either writing new character of color or [...] "trans-racializing" [...] existing characters from Whites to racial or ethnic minorities (e.g. the changing of Karate Kid's race from White to Asian).|$|E

40|$|The amphipods {{collected}} from the deep scattering layer (DSL) of Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal belonged to 13 families viz. Cystisomatidae, Oxyccphalidae, Pronoidae, Anapronoidae, Vibiliidae, Lycaeidae, Lycaeopsidae, Phronimidae, Platyscelidae, Phrosinidae, Scinidae, Lanceolidae and Hyperiidae. The amphipod abundance showed wide fluctuations. Oxyccphalidae, Phronimidae and platyscelidae were widely distributed in both <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> <b>and</b> oceanic regions of the west coast. In the east coast Phronimidae and Phrosinidae were widely distributed in <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> <b>and</b> these two families together with Vibiliidae and Platyscelidae were widely distributed in the oceanic regions. In this investigation only Phronimidae {{was found to have}} wide distribution in <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> <b>and</b> oceanic regions of both the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. Vibiliidae and Phrosinidae showed aggregation in the oceanic region and these two together with Lycaeidae showed such a trend in <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> of <b>the</b> west coast. Similarly in the east coast while Lycaeidae and Pronoidae showed aggregation in <b>the</b> <b>shelf,</b> only <b>the</b> former showed that trend in the oceanic region. While Cystisomatidae had a moderate distribution in <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> of both <b>the</b> coasts and in the oceanic region of the west coast, it had a poor distribution in the oceanic region of the east coast.

2500|$|A {{shadow of}} Dark Willow appears to fight Glory {{in the fifth}} season episode [...] "Tough Love", {{but she does not}} come into full force until the sixth season in [...] "Villains", [...] "Two to Go", and [...] "Grave". The {{transition}} from Willow into Dark Willow, precipitated by Tara's immediate death when she is shot through the heart, was ambiguously received by audiences, many of whom never foresaw Willow's psychic break. It was simultaneously lauded for being an overwhelming depiction of a powerful woman, and derided as representative of a worn cliché that lesbians are amoral and murderous. Dark Willow proved to be exceptionally more powerful than Buffy. She changes visually when she walks into the Magic Box, a store owned by Anya and Giles, telekinetically retrieves dozens of dark magic books from <b>the</b> <b>shelves,</b> <b>and</b> leeches the words from the pages with her fingertips.

2500|$|All {{types of}} {{literature}} were spread quickly in all directions. Newspapers began and even multiplied. Furthermore, the newspapers were immediately compromised, {{as the political}} factions created their own newspapers, planted stories and bribed journalists. Leading clerics had their sermon collections printed, which were top selling books. Since dissenting, Establishment and Independent divines were in print, the constant movement of these works helped defuse any region's religious homogeneity and fostered emergent latitudinarianism. Periodicals were exceedingly popular, {{and the art of}} essay writing was at nearly its apex. Furthermore, the happenings of the Royal Society were published regularly, and they were digested and explained or celebrated in more popular presses. The latest books of scholarship had [...] "keys", [...] "indexes" [...] and [...] "digests" [...] made of them that could popularise, summarise and explain them to a wide audience. The cross-index, now commonplace, was a novelty in the 18th century, and several persons created indexes for older books of learning to allow anyone to find what an author had to say about a given topic at a moment's notice. Books of etiquette, of correspondence and of moral instruction and hygiene multiplied. Economics began as a serious discipline but did so in the form of numerous [...] "projects" [...] for solving England, Ireland and Scotland's ills. Sermon collections, dissertations on religious controversy, and prophecies, both new and old and explained, cropped up in endless variety. In short, readers in the 18th century were overwhelmed by competing voices. Truth and falsehood sat side by side on <b>the</b> <b>shelves,</b> <b>and</b> anyone could be a published author, just as anyone could quickly pretend to be a scholar by using indexes and digests (Clair 45, 158–187).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{need for}} an {{accurate}} description of characteristic x-ray lines {{has led to the}} development of complex peak models that combine a Gauss, a <b>shelf</b> <b>and</b> a tail function. Via relationships that describe <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> <b>and</b> tail parameters as a function of the energy, it is possible to reduce the number of fit parameters significantly. In this work, we carried out an experiment to study <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> <b>and</b> tail parameters obtained with an HPGe detector. We observed a strong discontinuity in <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> <b>and</b> tail parameters around the K-edge energy of Ge. This indicates that these parameters are strongly dependent on the mass-attenuation coefficient of the detector material. Therefore, we propose relationships that describe those parameters as a function of the energy and the mass-attenuation coefficient. The implementation of these relationships in a fitting procedure results in a more robust fitting procedure with a much smaller number of fitting parameters. Excellent fits for HPGe spectra can be obtained. Because the detector dependence seems to be fairly general, we could successfully apply the model to Si(Li) spectra also...|$|R
