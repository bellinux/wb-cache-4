40|$|BACKGROUND: {{aortic valve}} {{replacement}} (AVR) {{the most common}} heart valve operation, accounts {{for a majority of}} all valve surgery performed in the elderly. The Perceval S (P) is a new aortic valve which is implanted without suturing, which causes a significant reduction in cross-clamping times (CCTs), and makes valve implantation easier and faster thanks to its collapsed profile. These features potentially allow the pool of operable patients to be expanded, even with minimally invasive surgery in isolated AVRs. AIM: to predict costs and outcomes of AVR procedures associated with this new valve in 4 European countries (Italy, France, Germany, and UK), as compared to traditional (<b>T)</b> <b>valve</b> implants, from the cost perspective of the hospital. METHOD: a probabilistic, patient-level simulation model was fully coded in WinBugs, permitting a seamless integration of parameter estimation and outcomes prediction, which was entirely based on the associated CCTs and on the surgical technique (mini-invasive [MiS] vs. full sternotomy [FS]), through published correlations. Unit cost were retrieved from official and literature sources for all countries. Besides the incorporated probabilistic sensitivity analysis, a series of deterministic sensitivity analyses was performed. RESULTS: the model predicts the use of the Perceval S valve to be associated with less complications and with savings (valve cost excluded), mainly related to a reduction in surgery costs and ICU/hospital bed days. These savings range from € 3, 600 (Italy) to £ 3, 900 (UK) for PFS in isolated AVRs and from about € 6, 000 (Italy) to £ 6, 700 (UK) for PMiS in isolated AVRs, and for PFS in concomitants. Extensive sensitivity analyses confirm the robustness of such findings. CONCLUSIONS: {{the results of the present}} analysis indicate that the hospital acquisition cost difference between the new sutureless Perceval S valve and traditional valves is offset by important savings in other cost items. </p...|$|E

Two parameters of bioprosthetic transvalvular flow were assessed: maximum velocity of diastolic left ventrcular inflow (V(mas)), and pressure half-time (P 1 / 2 <b>T).</b> Hancock <b>valves</b> showed higher V(max) and P 1 / 2 T values than Carpentier-Edwards and Liotta valves.

This study aims to determine, in vitro, the occurrence of Lenz forces on 9 heart valve prostheses at 1. 5 T and assess the risk of impedance of valve function. A specially designed hydro-pneumatic system was used to record pressure changes across the valve indicative of any MR induced alteration in leaflet performance. Nine cardiac valve prostheses were exposed to the B 0 field at 1. 5 <b>T.</b> Each <b>valve</b> was advanced through the B 0 field and continuous signals from high frequency pressure transducers were recorded and pressure drops across the valve were assessed using time correction superimposition.

Profiles were asymmetrical and there was no consistency in complex shape and valve type/sub-group. Irregularities in pressure profiles of 4 prostheses were detected indicating resistance of the occluder to the B 0 field. This study provides empirical evidence of the Lenz Effect on cardiac valve prostheses exposed to the MR B 0 field causing functional valve impedance and increasing the risk of valvular regurgitation and reduced cardiac output.

The interaction of rotating metallic heart valves with magnetic fields is studied by performing a time-domain analysis of the corresponding electromagnetic problem. We applied the finite element method (FEM) to solve the T − Ω formulation of Maxwell equations in two cases: first, for metallic disks located in the high intensity homogenous field of the magnet iso-center, and second, disks located in the non-uniform fringe field of the bore entrance. We showed that for valves with full solid disks (such as Starr-Edwards 6500) located in the magnet iso-center, the magnitude of adverse forces can be comparable to the forces applied by the beating heart. However, for rings which consist of multiply connected conductive regions, skin effect and proximity effect counteract, {{which leads to a}} diminished magnetic force.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. Cell-specific {{antibodies}} {{were used}} to identify immunocompetent cells in a comparison of valves from patients who had symptomatic tricuspid aortic stenosis with subjects who had no evidence of valvular heart disease. Background. Nonrheumatic valvular aortic stenosis {{is the most common}} valvular heart disease among adults. The biologic processes involved in the development of this disease are poorly understood. Methods. Tricuspid stenotic aortic valves were obtained from 19 patients undergoing surgery for nonrheumatic valvular aortic stenosis, and 10 control valves were collected at autopsy. The valves were fixed in formaldehyde, cryosectioned and stained with antibodies against fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, T lymphocytes and interlcukin- 2 receptors. A subset of valves were also analyzed with antibodies against T-helper cells and cytotoxic T cells. Results. Stenotic valves were characterized by a basal accumulation of calcium deposits and a cell-rich subendothelial thickening. The immunohistologic analysis indicated that the cells in the subendothelial connective tissue were fibroblasts. T lymphocytes appeared to be the most common cell type {{in the vicinity of the}} calcium deposits and were also found close to the endothelial lining of the valves. T-helper cells were more frequent than cytotoxic T cells. Expression of interleukin- 2 receptors occurred at the same location as <b>T</b> lymphocytes.

But one difficult problem for that is the differential volumetric flow through a single rod cylinder which is widely used in mobile hydraulic system. Several solutions have been presented {{to deal with it}} so far, but there still has not been a cost-effective solution to it. In recent years, an asymmetric pump-controlled asymmetric cylinder strategy has been presented to deal with this problem.

The flow rate ratio of the three ports of asymmetric axial piston pump was designed as 1 ::(1), in which was the area ratio of a single rod cylinder. An important task in the development of asymmetric axial piston pump was the design of the valve plate. There were three intake/discharge slots (slots A, B, and <b>T)</b> in the <b>valve</b> plate.

Pathological findings were suggested such as the calcification of all the valve leaflets increased with time, and the degree of the calcification of the three groups was as follows; H group>T 6 group>M group. The levels of Ca and Pi in the valve leaflets also increased progressively with time, and a positive exponential correlation was showed between the two groups (y= 0. 66135 + 0. 43903 x, r= 0. 9672). Ca levels in the valve leaflets of the porcine group were much greater than that of B group. However the Gla accumulated to the same levels in both groups and {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups. Mg levels also increased with time and a positive exponential correlation was showed between the Ca, Mg and Pi levels (Ca vs Mg, y= 0. 34 + 0. 007 x, r= 0. 913; Mg vs Pi, y= 0. 27 + 0. 02 x, r= 0. 954). Ca levels in the warfarin administered group were at the same levels as the control group in both P and B groups...|$|R
40|$|KERENA is an {{innovative}} {{boiling water reactor}} concept with passive safety systems (Generation III+) of AREVA. The reactor is an evolutionary design of operating BWRs (Generation II). In order to verify the functionality and performance of the KERENA safety concept required for the transient and accident management, the test facility "Integral Teststand Karlstein" (INKA) was built at Karlstein (Germany). It is a mock-up of the KERENA boiling water reactor containment, with integrated pressure suppression system. The complete chain of passive safety components is available. The passive components and the levels are represented in full scale. The volume scaling of the containment compartments is approximately 1 : 24. The reactor pressure vessel (RPV) is simulated via the steam accumulator of the Karlstein Large <b>Valve</b> <b>Test</b> Facility. This vessel provides an energy storage capacity of approximately 1 / 6 of the KERENA RPV and is supplied by a Benson boiler with a thermal power of 22 MW. With respect to the available power supply, the containment- and system-sizing of the facility {{is by far the}} largest one of its kind worldwide. From 2009 to 2012, several single component tests were conducted (Emergency Condenser, Containment Cooling Condenser, Core Flooding System etc.). On March 21 st, 2013, the worldwide first large-scale only passively managed integral accident test of a boiling water reactor was simulated at INKA. The integral test measured the combined response of the KERENA passive safety systems to the postulated initiating event was the "Main Steam Line Break" (MSLB) inside the Containment with decay heat simulation. The results of the performed integral test (MSLB) showed that the passive safety systems alone are capable to bring the plant to stable conditions meeting all required safety targets with sufficient margins. Therefore the test verified the function of those components and the interplay between them as response to an anticipated accident scenario. The test provided evidence that the INKA is worldwide the first large scale test facility to perform integral verification tests of passive safety concepts under plant-like scaling and thermodynamic conditions. Hence, the test facility also shows that it is capable to perform containment response tests for existing Generation II BWRs (with active safety systems) and advanced (passive) reactor designs besides KERENA. These test results can be used to strengthen existing containment codes with regard to heat transfer, natural circulation, gas- and temperature stratification and others.
