5|$|Early line-ups of the Strand—sometimes {{known as}} the Swankers—also {{included}} Jim Mackin on organ and Stephen Hayes (and later, briefly, Del Noones) on bass. The band members regularly hung out at two clothing shops on the Kings Road in Chelsea, London: John Krivine and Steph Raynor's Acme Attractions (where Don Letts worked as manager) and Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's <b>Too</b> <b>Fast</b> <b>to</b> Live, Too Young to Die.|$|E
5|$|Most enzyme {{kinetics}} studies concentrate on this initial, approximately linear part of enzyme reactions. However, {{it is also}} possible to measure the complete reaction curve and fit this data to a non-linear rate equation. This way of measuring enzyme reactions is called progress-curve analysis. This approach is useful as an alternative to rapid kinetics when the initial rate is <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> measure accurately.|$|E
5|$|There were consequences, as well, {{for other}} {{technological}} {{aspects of the}} cinema. Proper recording and playback of sound required exact standardization of camera and projector speed. Before sound, 16 frames per second (fps) was the supposed norm, but practice varied widely. Cameras were often undercranked or overcranked to improve exposures or for dramatic effect. Projectors were commonly run <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> shorten running time and squeeze in extra shows. Variable frame rate, however, made sound unlistenable, and a new, strict standard of 24 fps was soon established. Sound also forced the abandonment of the noisy arc lights used for filming in studio interiors. The switch to quiet incandescent illumination in turn required a switch to more expensive film stock. The sensitivity of the new panchromatic film delivered superior image tonal quality and gave directors the freedom to shoot scenes at lower light levels than was previously practical.|$|E

5|$|Galileo is lesser known for, {{yet still}} {{credited}} with, {{being one of}} the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously. Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result. We now know that the speed of light is far <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> be measured by such methods (with human shutter-openers on Earth).|$|E
25|$|The {{oscilloscope}} can {{be adjusted}} so that repetitive signals can be observed as a continuous shape on the screen. A storage oscilloscope allows single events to be captured by the instrument and displayed for a relatively long time, allowing observation of events <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> be directly perceptible.|$|E

25|$|In 1905, {{the yard}} gained a {{contract}} to build the Brown-Curtis steam turbine engine, which {{was considered to be}} <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> be economical at the time. That same year, the Navy awarded {{a contract to}} build the Chester-class cruisers at the yard, two of which were supposed to be equipped with the Brown-Curtis turbine, but which later received new turbines.|$|E
25|$|Low cost {{ballasts}} mostly contain only {{a simple}} oscillator and series resonant LC circuit. When turned on, the oscillator starts, and resonant current excites the LC circuit. This resonant current directly drives a switching transistor through a ring core transformer. This principle {{is called the}} current resonant inverter circuit. After a short time the voltage across the lamp reaches about 1nbsp&kV and the lamp ignites. The process is <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> preheat the cathodes, so the lamp instant-starts in cold cathode mode. The cathode filaments are still used for protection of the ballast from overheating if the lamp does not ignite. A few manufacturers use positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistors to disable instant starting and give some time to preheat the filaments.|$|E
25|$|Because it is a small, stable protein whose {{structure}} {{had been}} determined at high resolution by 1975, {{it was the}} first macromolecule of scientific interest to be simulated using molecular dynamics computation, in 1977 by J. Andrew McCammon and Bruce Gelin, in the Karplus group at Harvard. That study confirmed the then-surprising fact found in the NMR work that even well-packed aromatic sidechains in the interior of a stable protein can flip over rather rapidly (microsecond to millisecond time scale). Rate constants were determined by NMR for the hydrogen exchange of individual peptide NH groups along the chain, ranging from <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> measure on the most exposed surface to many months for the most buried hydrogen-bonded groups {{in the center of the}} β sheet, and those values also correlate fairly well with degree of motion seen in the dynamics simulations.|$|E

25|$|The double flash {{illusion}} {{was reported}} {{as the first}} illusion to show that visual stimuli can be qualitatively altered by audio stimuli. In the standard paradigm participants are presented combinations of one to four flashes accompanied by zero to 4 beeps. They {{were then asked to}} say how many flashes they perceived. Participants perceived illusory flashes when there were more beeps than flashes. fMRI studies have shown that there is crossmodal activation in early, low level visual areas, which was qualitatively similar to the perception of a real flash. This suggests that the illusion reflects subjective perception of the extra flash. Further, studies suggest that timing of multisensory activation in unisensory cortexes is <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> be mediated by a higher order integration suggesting feed forward or lateral connections. One study has revealed the same effect but from vision to audition, as well as fission rather than fusion effects, although the level of the auditory stimulus was reduced to make it less salient for those illusions affecting audition.|$|E
25|$|Green Muscle was {{developed}} under the LUBILOSA Programme, which was initiated in 1989 {{in response to}} environmental concerns over the heavy use of chemical insecticides to control locusts and grasshoppers during the 1987-89 plague. The project focused {{on the use of}} beneficial disease-causing microorganisms (pathogens) as biological control agents for grasshoppers and locusts. These insects were considered to be too mobile and to reproduce <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> be readily controlled by classical biological control. Pathogens have the advantage that many can be produced in artificial culture in large quantities and be used with ordinary spraying equipment. Entomopathogenic fungi were traditionally seen as needing humid conditions to work well. However, the LUBILOSA Programme found a way to avoid this by spraying fungal spores in an oil formulation. Even under desert conditions, Green Muscle can be used to kill locusts and other Acridid pests, such as the Senegalese grasshopper. During recent trials in Algeria and Mauritania (2005 and 2006), various natural enemies, but especially birds, were abundant enough to eliminate treated hopper bands in about a week, because the diseased hoppers became sluggish and easy to catch.|$|E

500|$|In early 1974, Jones {{convinced}} McLaren to {{help out}} the Strand. Effectively becoming the group's manager, McLaren paid for their first formal rehearsal space. Glen Matlock, an art student who occasionally worked at <b>Too</b> <b>Fast</b> <b>to</b> Live, Too Young to Die, was recruited as the band's regular bassist. In November, McLaren temporarily relocated to New York City. Before his departure, McLaren and Westwood had conceived a new identity for their shop: renamed SEX, it changed its focus from retro couture to S-inspired [...] "anti-fashion", with a billing as [...] "Specialists in rubberwear, glamourwear & stagewear".|$|E
500|$|In May 2004, {{further details}} were leaked {{including}} the height, speed and trains.

What am I?", [...] "What is taller than 10 giraffes and faster than a charging rhino?", and [...] "What is <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> see, but has a bird's eye view?". Track and support pieces were later seen in a large field, which further confirmed the new attraction would be a roller coaster.|$|E

500|$|In {{spite of}} often being accorded legendary status, {{albatrosses}} have not escaped either indirect or direct pressure from humans. Early encounters with albatrosses by Polynesians and Aleut Indians resulted in hunting {{and in some}} cases extirpation from some islands (such as Easter Island). As Europeans began sailing the world, they too began to hunt albatross, [...] "fishing" [...] for them from boats to serve at the table or blasting them for sport. This sport reached its peak on emigration lines bound for Australia, and only died down when ships became <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> fish from, and regulations forbade the discharge of weapons for safety reasons. In the 19th century, albatross colonies, particularly those in the North Pacific, were harvested for the feather trade, leading to the near-extinction of the short-tailed albatross.|$|E
500|$|Axis {{aircraft}} resumed shadowing at 05:00 and at 06:10, Indomitable sent Martlets {{to shoot}} down two Ju 88 reconnaissance aircraft, which proved too high and <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> intercept. Four Sea Hurricanes and Fulmars took off from the two carriers for air cover and every aircraft was readied to fly. German reconnaissance aircraft kept watch on the convoy, flying too high and fast for the FAA fighters. At 09:15, when the convoy was about [...] south-south-west of [...] Junkers Ju 88s dive-bombers of Lehrgeschwader 1 (LG 1) were intercepted [...] out. Four Ju 88s were shot down and another two were claimed by navy anti-aircraft gunners (German records showed five shot down and two lost over Sardinia from mechanical failure) {{for the loss of}} one FAA fighter. The German crews made extravagant claims but did little damage and three Italian reconnaissance aircraft were also shot down. Beaufighters returning from a raid on Sardinia, saw the 7th Cruiser Division (Da Zara) at sea and raised the alarm. The cruisers had sailed from Cagliari into the Tyrrhenian Sea at 08:10 on 11 August, escorted by the Maestrale-class destroyers Maestrale, Oriani and Gioberti, to rendezvous with Attendolo from Naples.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 31 January 1918, the Light Cruiser Force sortied from Rosyth to {{participate}} in a training exercise with elements of the Grand Fleet. The 12th and 13th Submarine Flotillas were sandwiched by squadrons of battlecruisers and battleships as the ships departed in poor visibility. Around 19:14 the steering gear of one of the 13th SF's submarines failed and she fell out of the formation. One of the trailing submarines did not see her in time and accidentally rammed her, badly damaging both boats. Commander William Leir commanded the 13th SF and decided to turn his flotilla around to their aid after he was notified of the accident around 17:40. In doing so, his ships crossed the path of the oncoming 12th SF and Fearless accidentally rammed and sank the submarine [...] Captain Charles Little attempted to avoid her, but the cruiser was moving <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> do so. She launched her boats in a failed attempt to rescue any survivors, but the few found were recovered by one of the other submarines. The bulkheads in Fearless bow had to be shored up to prevent further flooding, but she was not in any danger of sinking and returned to Rosyth at a very slow speed. She was repaired and survived the war, but was sold for scrap in November 1921.|$|E
30|$|Implicit suggestions: These {{are similar}} to the {{negative}} opinions. User likes and dislikes are taken into account to make recommendations.
