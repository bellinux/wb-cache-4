[Purpose] This study {{examined}} the effects of various dual <b>task</b> gait <b>training</b> methods (motor dual <b>task</b> gait <b>training,</b> cognitive dual <b>task</b> gait <b>training,</b> and motor and cognitive dual <b>task</b> gait <b>training)</b> on the balance and gait abilities of chronic stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-three outpatients performed dual <b>task</b> gait <b>training</b> for 30 minutes per day, three times a week, for eight weeks from June to August, 2012. Balance ability was measured pre-and posttest using the stability test index, the weight distribution index, the functional reach test, the timed up and go test, and the four square step test. Gait ability was measured by the 10 m walk test and a 6 min walk test before and after the training. The paired t-test was used to compare measurements before and after training within each group, and ANOVA was used to compare measurements before and after training among the groups. [Results] Comparisons within each group indicated significant differences in all variables between before and after the training in all three groups. Comparison between the groups showed that the greatest improvements were seen in all tests, except for the timed up and go test, following motor and cognitive dual <b>task</b> gait <b>training.</b> [Conclusion] In a real walking environment, the motor and cognitive dual <b>task</b> gait <b>training</b> was more effective at improving the balance and gait abilities of chronic stroke patients than either the motor dual <b>task</b> gait <b>training</b> or the cognitive dual <b>task</b> gait <b>training</b> alone...|$|R

50|$|Kerr et al {{demonstrated}} recall on {{a spatial}} memory task was affected negatively (increased errors) during concurrent standing balance task due to sharing of common neural resources for postural stability and cognitive processing. Furthermore, {{it was also}} found that attentional cost increased as the challenge to maintain balance on equilibrium tasks increased. This was demonstrated by increased reaction time to auditory stimulus when subject performed standing and walking rather than sitting.

50|$|Due to {{the spatial}} {{nature of the}} Barnes Maze, damage to the {{hippocampus}} leads to deficits in performance of the task.

During the <b>task</b> <b>training</b> where encoding would occur, females used more frequently a spatial strategy, while males preferably applied either serial, random or opposite strategies. In addition, it was noted that the spatial retention ability of female rats was largely dependent on the phase of their estrus cycle. The differences between males and females are found during the encoding period but not during the storage, indicating that acquisition and consolidation are differently influenced by sex in the Degu species.|$|E
50|$|Long-term {{goals are}} {{used to create a}} mental image of your end result of the goal. They may {{ultimately}} be harder to narrow down to specifics of path and deadlines. Categories like career goals, educational pursuits, or long-term financial planning often fall victim to external factors that can alter outcomes. Keeping the big picture in mind can help maintain value and motivation in pursuit of the long-term goals. While the long-term goals often hold the value for the pursuant, breaking them down into smaller more obtainable goals with a specific time frame can make them more effective (MindTools.com, 1996). The process of breaking down of long-term goals into realistic, short-term accomplishments can help build self-esteem, offer instant feedback, and provide check points to the individual to keep them on <b>task</b> (<b>Training</b> Journal, 2011, p. 55-58).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{effectiveness}} of the SaeboFlex orthosis, comparing unilateral versus bilateral <b>task</b> <b>training</b> with the device in patients with subacute and chronic stroke. This study addresses the question as to whether unilateral or bilateral <b>task</b> <b>training</b> is more beneficial for upper extremity motor and functional recovery after stroke while using the SaeboFlex, a relatively low-cost, client-driven orthotic device. The sample population consists of individuals who are greater than 6 months post-stroke and meet the specific qualifications for use of the device. Each participant is randomly assigned to the unilateral <b>task</b> <b>training</b> group (3 - 6 participants) or bilateral <b>task</b> <b>training</b> group (3 - 6 participants). The protocol for our study consists of six assessments for pre- and post-testing along with a five-day training session in the use of the device, if needed. This is followed by a four-week home program and outpatient training, where the program is completed six days a week, twice a day for 60 minutes and is upgraded as appropriate. We hypothesize that the bilateral <b>task</b> <b>training</b> group will result in a greater increase in motor function, performance satisfaction, and quality of movement as compared to the unilateral <b>task</b> <b>training</b> group, based on pre-test and post-test data. The study is currently in progress; thus far there are some promising observable and measurable results including decreased muscle tone, increased range of motion, and increased quality of movement in both the unilateral and bilateral <b>task</b> <b>training</b> groups.
