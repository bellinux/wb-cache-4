5|$|After the Bersiap in 1947 Dutch {{authorities}} {{attempted to}} retrieve the bodies of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> several survivors of the period provided legal testimony to the Attorney General office. Due to continued revolutionary warfare few bodies were found and few cases came to court. Around 3,500 graves of Bersiap victims {{can be found in}} the Kembang Kuning war cemetery in Surabaya and elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|The State of Florida {{declared}} Rosewood a Florida Heritage Landmark in 2004 {{and subsequently}} erected a historical marker on State Road 24 that names <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> describes the community's destruction. Scattered structures remain within the community, including a church, a business, {{and a few}} homes, notably John Wright's. Robie Mortin, the last survivor, died on June 12, 2010 at age 94 after a brief illness.|$|E

50|$|Panamanian {{authorities}} {{conducted a}} study which indicates that almost 90 percent of express kidnappings are unreported due to the threat that thieves impose on <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>and</b> relatives of <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> <b>The</b> procedure of express kidnapping consist of abducting <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>and</b> taking possession of valuables such as cellphones, watches, credit cards, cash and jewelry. Besides taking all of <b>the</b> <b>victim's</b> valuables, <b>the</b> kidnappers make <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> withdraw money from different ATM locations.|$|R
5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the 9/11 attack resulted in immediate responses to the event, including domestic reactions, hate crimes, Muslim American responses to the event, international responses to the attack, and military responses to the events. An extensive compensation program was quickly established by Congress in the aftermath to compensate <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> families of victims of the 9/11 attack as well.|$|E
5|$|The court heard how {{the bodies}} of Anneli Alderton and Annette Nicholls were {{deliberately}} posed in the cruciform position, with DNA evidence linking Steve Wright to three of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> fibre evidence also connecting him to the victims.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{complaints}} by family members of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> others that the military was failing to hold its personnel accountable, the U.S. Senate and U.S. House conducted their own investigations into the shootdown and the U.S. military's response to it. Also, Ronald R. Fogleman, the USAF's new Chief of Staff, conducted his own review of the actions taken by the USAF against the officers involved in the incident.|$|E

5|$|At {{first the}} {{painting}} met with mixed reactions from art critics and historians. Artists had previously tended to depict {{war in the}} high style of history painting, and Goya's unheroic description was unusual for the time. According to some early critical opinion the painting was flawed technically: the perspective is flat, or <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> executioners are standing too close together to be realistic. Although these observations may be strictly correct, the writer Richard Schickel argues that Goya was not striving for academic propriety but rather to strengthen the overall impact of the piece.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, {{guests at}} the new hotel watched the wreck and rescue efforts of the United States Life-Saving Service for the Norwegian bark Dictator. The ship's figurehead, which washed {{up on the beach}} several days later, was erected as a {{monument}} to <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> rescuers. It stood along the oceanfront for more than 50 years. In the 21st century, it inspired the pair of matching Norwegian Lady Monuments, sculpted by Ørnulf Bast and installed in Virginia Beach and Moss, Norway.|$|E
5|$|The Bonfire Memorial Commission {{collected}} {{the hundreds of}} thousands of items that were left by grieving visitors at the site of the collapse. At the Systems Building, Texas A leaders erected pictures of the deceased students. There, over a dozen seniors left behind their Aggie rings, permanently donating them to the students who did not live long enough to earn their own. Various organizations also established funds in memory of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> to help with expenses incurred because of the accident. In total, the funds received exceeded US$250,000.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{attempted}} murder is an inchoate crime. A conviction for {{attempted murder}} requires {{a demonstration of}} an intent to murder, meaning that the perpetrator either tried to murder and failed (e.g. attempted to shoot <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>and</b> missed or shot <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> survived) or took a substantial step towards committing a murder (e.g. purchasing a gun or other deadly weapon and writing about his intent to kill).|$|R

5|$|The {{accident}} {{became a}} subject of intense news coverage. The origin of the poorly stored radioactive source was traced to KSE, which was charged with possessing radioactive substances without permission and was fined 15,000 baht (approx $450). Environmental Litigation and Advocacy for the Wants (EnLAW), a non-governmental advocacy group, later filed a class action lawsuit against KSE on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>victims,</b> <b>and</b> also against the OAEP in the Administrative Court. The Administrative Court later ruled in 2003 in favour of the plaintiffs, ordering the OAEP to pay 5,222,301 baht (approx $155,000) as restitution. KSE was ordered by the Civil Court to pay a total of 640,246 baht (approx $19,000).|$|E
5|$|The attack {{occurred}} at 21:15 on a Wednesday evening, {{as a football}} game featuring Spain and Iceland was being shown. The four participants exited their car carrying shotguns and machine guns and opened fire on the bar. The bullets shattered the skull of three of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> hit the fourth in the heart. Three of the targets were killed instantly, with the fourth dying shortly afterwards in hospital. A fifth person was injured after being hit in the foot, but survived the attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the murders and of the victims drew {{attention}} to the poor living conditions in the East End and galvanised public opinion against the overcrowded, unsanitary slums. In the two decades after the murders, the worst of the slums were cleared and demolished, but the streets and some buildings survive and the legend of the Ripper is still promoted by guided tours of the murder sites. The Ten Bells public house in Commercial Street was frequented by at least one of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> was the focus of such tours for many years. In 2015, the Jack the Ripper Museum opened in east London.|$|E

A national moment of silence was held at 11:00a.m. EST on January 10, 2011 on the South Lawn of the White House as well as the steps of the United States Capitol.

The Syndicate meets over the capture of the Rebel. The Well-Manicured Man informs them of the existence of the Russian vaccine, believing that this makes resistance to the Colonists possible. If the vaccine is ineffective he proposes avoiding handing over the Rebel and instead forming an alliance with the Rebels, but the other Syndicate members believe this would be a suicidal course of action.|$|E
5|$|At 9:03a.m., {{the first}} of over 1,8009-1-1 calls related to the bombing was {{received}} by Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA). By that time, EMSA ambulances, police, and firefighters had heard the blast and were already headed to the scene. Nearby civilians, who had also witnessed or heard the blast, arrived to assist <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> emergency workers. Within 23minutes of the bombing, the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) was set up, consisting of representatives from the state departments of public safety, human services, military, health, and education. Assisting the SEOC were agencies including the National Weather Service, the Air Force, the Civil Air Patrol, and the American Red Cross.

5|$|Crawford and Knight {{were taken}} to Wingenund's camp on June 7, where they found nine other prisoners. On June 11, Captain Pipe painted {{the faces of the}} prisoners black, the {{traditional}} sign they were to be executed. The prisoners were marched to the Delaware town on Tymochtee Creek, near the present-day village of Crawford, Ohio. Four prisoners were killed with tomahawks and scalped along the way. When the war party stopped, the seven remaining prisoners were made to sit, with Crawford and Knight a short distance away from the others. Delaware women and boys killed the other five with tomahawks, beheading one of them. The boys scalped <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> slapped the bloody scalps in the faces of Crawford and Knight.|$|E
5|$|For the {{following}} 19 months, the club played games away from Valley Parade. Cherry {{and the players}} became a close-knit team, attending funerals of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> other engagements {{in the months that}} followed, and the club's 13th place finish in Division Two in 1985–86 was hailed a major achievement. During Bradford's time away from Valley Parade, McCall also turned his back on Leeds United, the team he had supported as a child, after their fans set fire to a chip van at Odsal Stadium. McCall became club captain in November 1986, aged just 21, after Peter Jackson moved to Newcastle United. Under Cherry's replacement, Terry Dolan, the club held off any relegation threats to finish tenth in 1986–87. Like Jackson, McCall and Hendrie were both keen to move to a Division One club, but they agreed in 1987 to stay for one final season.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{emergency}} personnel {{responded to the}} crash site and helped save victims. Many of those who survived were severely injured and required months or years to physically recover. NTSB investigators looked at various factors {{that contributed to the}} crash. The failures of the flight crew were cited as the probable cause of the crash, but the weather, air traffic controller performances, and FAA traffic management were also cited as contributing to the events that led to the accident. This conclusion was controversial, with disagreement between investigators, passengers, and Avianca as to who was ultimately responsible. Eventually, the U.S. government joined with Avianca and settled to pay for the damages to <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> their families. The crash was also portrayed in a variety of media.|$|E
50|$|TCP/IP HijackingTCP/IP Hijacking {{is another}} way that uses spoofed packets {{to take over a}} {{connection}} between <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>and</b> a host machine. This technique is mainly used to collect passwords when a host machine uses a password to be connected to. When this type of attack takes place <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> attacker must be on the same network. Another form of TCP/IP hijacking is RST hijacking, which involves injecting a fake reset packet.|$|R
