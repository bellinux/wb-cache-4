Using transportation fuels more efficiently is also an integral part of a sustainable transport strategy.|$|E

5|$|Brodie {{believed}} that previous historians had unduly vilified Stevens, and she enjoyed <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> rebuilding a reputation rather than, as in her Joseph Smith biography, tearing one down.

5|$|By late October, the German {{forces were}} worn out, {{with only a}} third of their motor {{vehicles}} still functioning, infantry divisions at third- to half-strength, and serious logistics issues preventing the delivery of warm clothing and other winter equipment to the front.
