5|$|When {{the legendary}} donor Karna {{died in the}} epic Mahabharata war, his soul transcended to heaven, where he was offered gold and jewels as food. However, Karna needed real food to eat and asked Indra, the lord of heaven, the reason for serving gold as food. Indra told Karna that he had donated gold all his life, but had never donated food to his {{ancestors}} in Shraddha. Karna said that since {{he was unaware of}} his ancestors, he never donated anything in <b>their</b> <b>memory.</b> To make amends, Karna was permitted to return to earth for a 15â€“day period, so that he could perform Shraddha and donate food and water in <b>their</b> <b>memory.</b> This period is now known as Pitru Paksha. In some legends, Yama replaces Indra.|$|E
5|$|Following his death, Johnston was commemorated {{in several}} ways, {{including}} a memorial fund established {{in his name}} at the University of Washington to fund graduate-level research.

Johnston's life and death are featured in several documentaries, films, docudramas and books. Along with others who died during the eruption, Johnston's name is inscribed on memorials dedicated to <b>their</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E
5|$|In September 1922, {{the ground}} held a Grand Fete, {{to raise money}} to repair the tower of Blacklands Church. In 1948, the ground was flooded, and the Public Health Committee report into the storm floods had to be {{withdrawn}} after a magistrate appeared to provide misinformation in his statutory declaration. In his declaration, he had claimed to have been at the Central Recreation Ground for two 15 minute time periods during the flooding period and claimed to have seen the flooding, but at those times, the ground had not yet been flooded. The ground had previously flooded in 1866, when one resident noted that it had been underwater many times within <b>their</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E
40|$|Although {{our ability}} to store {{semantic}} declarative information can nowadays be readily surpassed by that of simple personal computers, {{our ability to}} learn and express procedural memories still outperforms that of supercomputers controlling the most advanced robots. To a large extent, our procedural memories are formed in the cerebellum, which embodies {{more than two-thirds of}} all neurons in our brain. In this review, we will focus on the emerging view that different modules of the cerebellum use different encoding schemes to form and express <b>their</b> respective <b>memories.</b> More specifically, zebrin-positive zones in the cerebellum, such as those controlling adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, appear to predominantly form <b>their</b> <b>memories</b> by potentiation mechanisms and express <b>their</b> <b>memories</b> via rate coding, whereas zebrin-negative zones, such as those controlling eyeblink conditioning, appear to predominantly form <b>their</b> <b>memories</b> by suppression mechanisms and express <b>their</b> <b>memories</b> in part by temporal coding using rebound bursting. Together, the different types of modules offer a rich repertoire to acquire and control sensorimotor processes with specific challenges in the spatiotemporal domain...|$|R

50|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{flashbulb}} memories are not very stable over time. A study conducted on the recollection of flashbulb memories for the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster sampled two independent groups of subjects on a date close to the disaster, and another eight months later. Very few subjects had flashbulb memories for the disaster after eight months. Considering only the participants who could recall the source of the news, ongoing activity, and place, researchers reported that less than 35% had detailed memories. Another study examining participants' memories for the Challenger Space Shuttle explosion found that although participants were highly confident about <b>their</b> <b>memories</b> for the event, <b>their</b> <b>memories</b> were not very accurate three years after the event had occurred. A third study conducted on the O.J. Simpson murder case found that although participants' confidence in <b>their</b> <b>memories</b> remained strong, the accuracy of <b>their</b> <b>memories</b> declined 15 months after the event, and continued to decline 32 months after the event.|$|R

5|$|Grossman and Schafer brainstormed {{regularly}} to devise the time travel puzzles, and collaborated {{with members of}} the development team as well as other LucasArts employees. They would identify puzzle problems and work towards a solution similar to how the game plays. Most issues were addressed prior to programming, but some details were left unfinished to work on later. The staff conceived puzzles involving the U.S.'s early history based on <b>their</b> <b>memory</b> of their compulsory education, and using the more legendary aspects of history, such as George Washington cutting down a cherry tree to appeal to international audiences. To complete the elements, Grossman researched the period to maintain historical accuracy, visiting libraries and contacting reference librarians. The studio, however, took creative license towards facts to fit them into the game's design.|$|E

5|$|Bumblebee {{species are}} declining in Europe, North America, and Asia {{due to a}} number of factors, {{including}} land-use change that reduces their food plants. In North America, pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for the subgenus Bombus. A major impact on bumblebees was caused by the mechanisation of agriculture, accelerated by the urgent need to increase food production during the Second World War. Small farms depended on horses to pull implements and carts. The horses were fed on clover and hay, both of which were permanently grown on a typical farm. Little artificial fertiliser was used. Farms thus provided flowering clover and flower-rich meadows, favouring bumblebees. Mechanisation removed the need for horses and most of the clover; artificial fertilisers encouraged the growth of taller grasses, outcompeting the meadow flowers. Most of the flowers, and the bumblebees that fed on them, disappeared from Britain by the early 1980s. The last native British short-haired bumblebee was captured near Dungeness in 1988. This significant increase in pesticide and fertilizer use associated with the industrialization of agriculture has had adverse effects on the Bombus genus. The bees are directly exposed to the chemicals in two ways: by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with pesticide, or through physical contact with treated plants and flowers. The species Bombus hortorum in particular {{has been found to be}} impacted by the pesticides; their brood development has been reduced and <b>their</b> <b>memory</b> has been negatively affected. Additionally, pesticide use negatively impacts colony development and size.|$|E
