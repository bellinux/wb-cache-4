40|$|The noise, {{radiated}} {{from the}} tailpipe of automotive exhaust ducts, {{is affected by}} the jet flow leaving the exhaust and by its surrounding geometry. The current work extends existing studies of sound radiation from a jet pipe with radiation over a rigid ground surface and relies on a numerical study. A simplified approach is used where the mean flow properties behind the tailpipe are calculated by solving the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS). The extended Fourier pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method is then utilized to compute the sound propagation in the tailpipe geometry by solving the linearized Euler equations (LEE). As the vorticity modes in the shear layer behind the tailpipe may turn unstable using the LEE, additional calculations with the LEE with applied high wave number dissipation and the LEE with mean flow gradient terms suppressed (LEE-GTS) are carried out. Results are validated by analytical expressions in free field and the necessity of solving the LEE rather than the LEE-GTS in the current application is shown. Finally, a calculation of <b>tailpipe</b> <b>noise</b> radiation over a ground surface is performed. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} {{silencers}} for internal combustion (I. C.) engines {{is a key}} issue to attenuate or emphasize certain spectral components of <b>tailpipe</b> <b>noise.</b> The optimization of complex shape silencing systems is generally a time-consuming operation, which {{must be carried out}} by means of concurrent experimental measurements and numerical simulations. This paper describes the development and application of different non-linear models: a coupled 1 D-multiD model and a coupled 1 D-quasi- 3 D model, to predict the silencer behavior in the time and frequency domains. Second order time and space discretization were adopted in the 3 D and quasi- 3 D approaches, whereas specific coupling strategies were developed to realize the interface between them and the 1 D model. In particular, since the 3 D relies on a collocated grid discretization, a Riemann solver based method was developed to realize the coupling with the 1 D code while a cell overlapping procedure was exploited to interface the 1 D code with the quasi- 3 D method in order to fit with the pseudo staggered grid arrangement. Both a white noise and a single impulse boundary conditions have been imposed upstream of the pipe system to excite the wave motion. The integrated 1 D-multiD and the quasi- 3 D approaches were applied to predict the transmission loss of reactive and dissipative mufflers in which the pressure waves can be significantly non-planar, to point out the influence of higher order modes on the acoustic performance. Reverse chambers with extended inlet and outlet and perforates have been investigated, showing the potential of both the hybrid 1 D- 3 D code and the quasi- 3 D code with respect to a simple, fully 1 D model. A comparison between predicted results of transmission loss and experimental measurements has pointed out the importance of correctly capturing multi-dimensional wave effects at mid and high frequencies as well as the effects of high amplitude perturbations and mean flow...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated design/simulation/test approach {{for evaluating the}} sound quality of exhaust noise {{as early as possible}} in the exhaust system design and development process. A time domain engine/exhaust simulation program is used to calculate the engine order content of the <b>tailpipe</b> radiated <b>noise</b> from an odd fire V- 10 exhaust system. Both steady state and transient conditions are simulated and sound files generated for exhaust sound quality evaluation. To increase the realism of played back sounds, the predicted engine orders are mixed with synthesized or recorded background noise for both steady state and transient conditions. These alternative approaches will be described and evaluated for technical feasibility and sound quality...|$|R
5000|$|Buses {{equipped}} with the GM-Allison EP50 and the Allison H 50 EP parallel hybrid systems have a special [...] "hush mode" [...] that allows the buses to operate solely on electric power, reducing <b>tailpipe</b> emissions and <b>noise</b> while operating in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel. Before entering the tunnel, the operator pushes a button that puts the coach into hush mode. While buses are inside stations, the coaches operate solely on electric propulsion (although, while the doors are closed, the engine still rotates in order to operate auxiliary loads). In between the tunnel's stations, the bus uses electric traction to get to 15 mi/h km/h, after which {{a combination of the}} electric and diesel motors are used. The operation of the diesel engine allows the batteries to recharge. Hush mode is normally deactivated by the operator as they exit the tunnel, but the mode will be automatically deactivated after the coach has traveled a certain distance.|$|R
