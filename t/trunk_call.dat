50|$|As per Rule 428 of the India telegraphic rules, {{no person}} without the {{sanction}} of the telegraph authority, use any telephone or cause or suffer {{it to be}} used, purposes other than the establishment of local or <b>trunk</b> <b>calls.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lacking {{resources}} of cultural significance such as greenstone and plentiful timber, they found outlets for their ritual {{needs in the}} carving of dendroglyphs (incisions into tree <b>trunks,</b> <b>called</b> rakau momori). Some of these carvings are protected by the J M Barker (Hapupu) National Historic Reserve.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that law}} {{explicitly}} prohibits <b>trunk</b> <b>calls</b> to a PSTN phone {{within the same}} local area in a geographic phone zone (e.g. from Kyivi to Kiev), so one cannot dial 0~2 or 0~xx for this, unless the phone exchange is misconfigured or a special circumstance occurs.|$|R
6000|$|The {{telephone}} {{bell rings}} with the petulant persistence that marks a <b>trunk</b> <b>call,</b> and I go in from some ineffectual gymnastics {{on the lawn}} {{to deal with the}} irruption. There is the usual trouble in connecting up, minute voices in Folkestone and Dover and London call to one another and are submerged by buzzings and throbbings. Then in elfin tones the real message comes through: [...] "Bl√©riot has crossed the Channel.... An article ... about what it means." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let the Mingo {{women go}} weep over their slain!" [...] {{returned}} the Indian, with characteristic pride and unmoved firmness; [...] "the Great Snake of the Mohicans has coiled himself in their wigwams, and has poisoned their triumph with the wailings of children whose fathers have not returned! Eleven warriors lie hid from {{the graves of}} their tribes since the snows have melted, and none will tell where to find them when the tongue of Chingachgook shall be silent! Let them draw the sharpest knife, and whirl the swiftest tomahawk, for their bitterest enemy is in their hands. Uncas, topmost branch of a noble <b>trunk,</b> <b>call</b> on the cowards to hasten or their hearts will soften, and they will change to women!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Enquiring {{for her at}} tea time Soames {{learned that}} Fleur had {{been out in the}} car since two. Three hours! Where had she gone? Up to London without a word to him? He had never become quite {{reconciled}} with cars. He had embraced them in principle--like the born empiricist, or Forsyte, that he was--adopting each symptom of progress as it came along with: [...] "Well, we couldn't do without them now." [...] But in fact he found them tearing, great, smelly things. Obliged by Annette to have one--a Rollhard with pearl-grey cushions, electric light, little mirrors, trays for the ashes of cigarettes, flower vases--all smelling of petrol and stephanotis--he regarded it much as he used to regard his brother-in-law, Montague Dartie. The thing typified all that was fast, insecure, and subcutaneously oily in modern life. As modern life became faster, looser, younger, Soames was becoming older, slower, tighter, more and more in thought and language like his father James before him. He was almost aware of it himself. Pace and progress pleased him less and less; there was an ostentation, too, about a car which he considered provocative in the prevailing mood of Labour. On one occasion that fellow Sims had driven over the only vested interest of a working man. Soames had not forgotten the behaviour of its master, when not many people would have stopped to put up with it. He had been sorry for the dog, and quite prepared to take its part against the car, if that ruffian hadn't been so outrageous. With four hours fast becoming five, and still no Fleur, all the old car-wise feelings he had experienced in person and by proxy balled within him, and sinking sensations troubled the pit of his stomach. At seven he telephoned to Winifred by <b>trunk</b> <b>call.</b> No! Fleur had not been to Green Street. Then where was she? Visions of his beloved daughter rolled up in her pretty frills, all blood and dust-stained, in some hideous catastrophe, began to haunt him. He went to her room and spied among her things. She had taken nothing--no dressing-case, no Jewellery. And this, a relief in one sense, increased his fears of an accident. Terrible to be helpless when his loved one was missing, especially when he couldn't bear fuss or publicity of any kind! What should he do if she were not back by nightfall? ...|$|E
50|$|Google Voice and <b>Call</b> <b>Trunk</b> {{are good}} {{examples}} of the cloud bridge model. Google Voice requires that subscriber phone(s) be registered with the service, whereas <b>Call</b> <b>Trunk</b> allows any phone to be used at any time. Google Voice allows inbound call recording only; <b>Call</b> <b>Trunk</b> only allows outbound call recording.|$|R
50|$|Remote call {{forwarding}} {{is also a}} means for a suburban business to obtain a city-centre local number (with its full large-city coverage area) for inbound calls; while cheaper than a foreign exchange line, this can reduce long-distance telephony costs in markets where local calls are flat-rated but <b>trunk</b> <b>calls</b> are expensive.|$|R
50|$|Subscriber trunk {{dialling}} (STD, {{also known}} as subscriber toll dialling) is a telephone system allowing subscribers to dial <b>trunk</b> <b>calls</b> without operator assistance. The term was introduced when it first became possible for long-distance calls to be dialled directly, and is now rarely used where calls to any destination can be dialled.|$|R

50|$|In the UK and the Commonwealth countries, a <b>trunk</b> <b>call</b> was {{the term}} for long {{distance}} calling, involving more than one telephone exchange, in contrast to making a local call.|$|E
50|$|In 1887, the railway, now {{preserved}} as the Derwent Valley Railway, was built. In 1888, Australia's first telephone <b>trunk</b> <b>call</b> {{was connected}} from Hobart to the Bush Inn Hotel in New Norfolk.|$|E
50|$|In the 1940s, the Bell System {{developed}} the North American Numbering Plan, {{a system of}} initially 86 allocated area codes which were used at first only by switchboard operators to route <b>trunk</b> <b>calls</b> between plan areas. Direct long-distance dialing by customers, using the three-digit area code and a seven-digit telephone number, commenced in the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|Group {{switching}} centres {{were required}} {{because it was}} not cost effective to have direct circuits between every exchange in the country. The GSC serving the calling party would act as a concentrator for <b>trunk</b> <b>calls</b> and an operator or, if an STD dialled routing was available, it would establish the call to the appropriate GSC serving the called party's exchange.|$|R
5000|$|Feature Group C: Rare, {{originally}} used by AT&T for operator-assisted coin phones {{since they}} allow the operator {{to keep control}} of the caller's telephone line until the transaction is completed. As coin-handling for <b>trunk</b> <b>calls</b> is now automated within the phone (like a COCOT, {{the current generation of}} coin phones operates self-contained without the central exchange providing coin-call support functions), group 'C' is largely obsolete.|$|R
50|$|In telecommunications, {{a long-distance}} call or <b>trunk</b> <b>call</b> is a {{telephone}} call made to a location outside a defined local calling area. Long-distance calls are typically charged a higher billing rate than local calls. The term is not necessarily synonymous with placing calls to another telephone area code.|$|E
50|$|Area code 1-200: There is no non-geographic {{area code}} 200, {{although}} exchange 1-NPA-200-XXXX now exists in many local area codes (if {{it has not}} been explicitly reserved). The 1-200 area has occasionally been used as an unused space in which to place test numbers, but is rare as in most communities a 1- indicates a long-distance <b>trunk</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{regulatory}} structure in British Telecom exchanges {{differs from the}} North American system as there are no free local calls. A long-distance call is therefore known not as a [...] "toll call" [...] but as a <b>trunk</b> <b>call.</b> It traditionally carried a higher rate ("national rate" [...] instead of [...] "local rate") and requires a trunk prefix and area code be dialled before the number. A <b>trunk</b> <b>call</b> is prefixed with '0' for national calls and '00' for international calls, the European standard. It is now normal for local calls to cost the same as long distance UK calls, and is now common, for a small extra monthly charge, to allow free calls to landlines within the UK. This free call allowance does not normally cover calls to the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands, which whilst confusingly having UK national dialling codes, are separate telephone administrations.|$|E

50|$|When the UK's {{original}} STD codes were allocated in {{the late}} 1950s, London was given the code 01. Relatively few subscribers could dial <b>trunk</b> <b>calls,</b> so the 01 code was not generally included {{as part of the}} published telephone number. In the early 1960s London telephones still had exchange names, the first three letters having to be dialled before the four-digit local number, e.g. ABBey 1234 (London Transport).|$|R

50|$|Following the {{liberalization}} of the telecommunications industry, new carriers are assigned new carrier-specific codes for international and regional <b>trunk</b> <b>call</b> services. The codes 020 and 011 are assigned to the incumbent carrier SingTel. The other two major carriers, M1 and StarHub, do not offer any special dialling arrangements for calling to Malaysia and Indonesia, instead requiring full international dialling, the same as calling other countries.|$|E
5000|$|A long {{distance}} <b>trunk</b> <b>call</b> {{within the same}} area code used to be dialable as 1 + seven digits, without the area code. This was broken NANP-wide by 1995. In areas using [...] "toll alerting", where long-distance calls are identified by a trunk prefix (a leading 1-) to be distinguishable from flat-rate local calls, all toll calls must be dialled with the area code.|$|E
5000|$|The 506-733 prefix {{could be}} dumped as far out-of-region as {{possible}} within the 506 area code boundary, if {{calls to the}} other side of the same code are long-distance and a <b>trunk</b> <b>call</b> within the area code requires the entire number (including the leading 1-506) be dialled. By dumping the 506-733 prefix in Edmundston, the geographically-furthest point still in New Brunswick, the administrator adopts this approach.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{of these}} {{messages}} often include the phrase [...] "Your call cannot be completed as dialed." [...] Sometimes a message {{would say to}} first dial a 1 or a 0 (the toll prefix for a <b>trunk</b> <b>call)</b> plus the area code of the called number. A message may also be played when 0 or 1 followed by an area code is prepended unnecessarily on landline phone calls to local destinations.|$|E
50|$|American {{message unit}} {{counters}} generally had four digits, which sufficed {{because they were}} only used on local calls and most residential lines did not pay for local calls. Despite the arrival of subscriber trunk dialling (automatic long-distance dialing) in Europe, central offices there continued making and using message registers in the 1970s, designing ones that could register more than one click per second on a <b>trunk</b> <b>call</b> and display five or six digits.|$|E

50|$|When {{telephone}} {{systems were}} first introduced, subscribers called a telephone exchange and asked a human operator {{to connect the}} call to another subscriber on the same exchange; calls to other exchanges were originally not possible. Later it became possible to dial numbers on the same exchange; calls to other exchanges (<b>trunk</b> <b>calls)</b> were possible, but had to be connected by an operator. When subscribers in one area became able to dial non-local subscribers, the term used for the innovation was subscriber trunk dialling.|$|R
