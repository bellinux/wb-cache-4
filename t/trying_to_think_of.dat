Nick is getting fed up with living in his ghastly flat and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a way to move back into the family home. The gap between Michael's IQ {{and the rest of the}} family's seems to be increasing, but so is his libido. And Abi is still Abi, only more so! As for perennially put-upon Ben, what with a new arrival causing chaos in the surgery, being forced to take tango lessons and being officially {{declared}} dead, life is just one long major-league cirsis.|$|E

500|$|This is {{the only}} episode {{that does not have}} [...] "the" [...] in the title. A {{decision}} was made to name all the episodes in this way so that the writers would not waste time <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> funny titles and instead make the content of the episode funny. However, this decision was made after the script for [...] "Male Unbonding" [...] was completed. Jerry Seinfeld tried to have the title of the episode changed to [...] "The Male Unbonding" [...] some time later, but was unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|Artist Richard Chopping {{once again}} {{provided}} the cover art for the book. On 18 March 1959 Fleming {{had written to}} Chopping about the cover he had undertaken for Goldfinger, saying that: [...] "The new jacket is quite as big a success as the first one and I do think [...] Cape have made a splendid job of it". Moving on to For Your Eyes Only, Fleming said [...] "I am busily scratching my head <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a subject for you again.

500|$|In {{the scene}} where the boys are talking to Chef, he leaves without {{answering}} the boys' sexual question, angrily saying, [...] "Dammit, children, why do I {{always have to be}} the one to explain all this stuff to you. Ask your parents for once!". This is in reference to Chef's tendency to give advice to the boys. While the children are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> what is the most important thing for a man, Cartman says [...] "Ham?", to which Stan angrily replies, [...] "No, not ham, you fat fuck!". This exchange was used verbatim between the same characters in The Spirit of Christmas, the 1995 short film that was the precursor to South Park.|$|E
500|$|From June to August 2003, {{the group}} {{was part of the}} Warped Tour. Reyes {{contacted}} his friend, Breaking Pangaea frontman Fred Mascherino, who auditioned for Nolan's place; on August 5, it was announced that Mascherino {{was a member of the}} band. Bassist Matt Rubano, who grew up with O'Connell, then joined the group. Rubano was asked to audition by O'Connell but was initially hesitant, since he was not a fan of emo music or aware of the band; however, he bought the album and learned Cooper's parts. On September 16, [...] "You're So Last Summer" [...] was released as a radio single. From September to November Taking Back Sunday co-headlined a tour with Saves the Day, supported by Moneen. In November, a music video for [...] "You're So Last Summer" [...] was filmed at Fulton State Park in New York. The video, directed by Winters, debuted on MTV on November 24. In the video, the band plays while Public Enemy vocalist Flavor Flav (in full regalia) jumps. According to Lazzara, {{the group was}} making fun of itself: [...] "We had two guys leave our band and there were two main singers, so we were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a way to bring the new band members into the video, but not have Fred singing the old guy’s part. And the funniest way to do that was to use Flavor Flav." ...|$|E
500|$|Several co-stars found Steiger difficult; Warren Oates, {{according}} to director Norman Jewison, viewed Steiger as [...] "somebody {{who had a}} tendency to go over the top" [...] during the making of In The Heat of the Night. Writer Richard Dyer highlights the contrast in the film between the acting styles of Steiger and Poitier, with [...] "Poitier's stillness and implied intensity" [...] and [...] "Steiger's busy, exteriorised method acting". Humphrey Bogart, Steiger's co-star of The Harder They Fall, referred to Steiger's method acting as the [...] "scratch-your-ass-and-mumble school of acting". Director Robert Aldrich notes that Steiger had a habit of changing his lines, which often confused his co-stars. Aldrich stated: [...] "Usually I lie awake at nights <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> ways to improve an actor's performance. With Steiger, the problem is to try and contain him". Steiger was particularly aggressive towards director Kenneth Annakin during the making of Across the Bridge, insisting on rewriting most of the script and changing many of the lines to better fit Steiger's idea of the character. Annakin stated that he had [...] "never known an actor to put so much thought and preparation into a performance" [...] as Steiger. Hutchinson revealed that Steiger often suffered from panic during filming and that fear of failure haunted him throughout his life, but fear also provided him with a source of strength in his acting.|$|E

500|$|When {{starting}} {{out as a}} comedy writer, Appel recalled: [...] "One reason I caught up to my contemporaries is that when I started to send out my scripts, the idea that I'd been on the Lampoon, even 8 or 10 years before, was a credential I could use." [...] Appel got his first television job when David Mirkin hired him for the writing staff of The Simpsons in 1994, initially on a ten-week contract, {{and served as a}} writer and producer there for four years. There, he wrote seven episodes, often employing the use of [...] "joke sequences, a narrative approach to humor that eschews the quick laugh in favor of something that develops over time." [...] Appel found work on The Simpsons to be a learning curve because it was a [...] "very tough show to write for." [...] His first episode was season seven's [...] "Mother Simpson". Appel was desperately <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a story idea to show and decided that he had to really reach out and opted to do something about Homer's mother, who previously had only been mentioned once. He named her Mona Simpson, after his wife. Many of the writers could not believe that an episode about Homer's mother had not previously been produced. The writers used the episode to solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from. Also for season seven he penned [...] "Bart on the Road", in which he utilized the plot devices of [...] "go to work with your parents day" [...] and Bart getting a driving license, and contributed to the episode [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield"; the two segments he wrote for the episode (one about Marge, the other about Lionel Hutz) were both cut. Appel wrote two episodes from season eight, [...] "Bart After Dark" [...] and [...] "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson", as well as season nine's [...] "The Two Mrs Nahasapeemapetilons" [...] and season 10's [...] "When You Dish Upon A Star".|$|E

2500|$|Rowling has {{continued}} to make references, less humorous and more, to {{the severity of the}} shipper conflicts. In one instance she has joked about <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> ways of proving to Emerson, when inviting him for the aforementioned interview, that it was really her and not [...] "some angry Harry/Hermione shipper trying to lure him down a dark alleyway"; In another, she has described her impression of the Harry Potter fandom's shipping debates as [...] "cyber gang warfare".|$|E

2500|$|The {{naming of}} Kurt Hectic was {{inspired}} by two disparate sources. In {{the early stages of}} development, some of the team saw the 1993 Mike Leigh film, Naked, in which David Thewlis' character says to a junkie, [...] "What is it like in your head? Hectic?" [...] Bruty and Williams loved the line, and decided Hectic should be the character's surname. When <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> his first name, they wanted to name him after someone who lived a notoriously hectic life, and settled on Kurt Cobain.|$|E
2500|$|After {{graduating from}} college, Wright sought a new weekend sport to replace baseball. Several {{of his friends}} were wrestling {{professional}}ly, and Wright {{decided to become a}} professional wrestler as well. With no formal training, he wrestled (and lost) his first match on December 4, 1993, under a mask as [...] "El Chico". While wrestling on the independent circuit, Wright was approached by Pat and Rocky Anderson, who complimented him on his skills and appearance and offered him membership in the apocryphal Anderson family. Anderson spent two weeks <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> an appropriate forename, eventually settling on his initials, C.W., at the suggestion of an interviewer; he thus became C.W. Anderson. Anderson later met Ole Anderson but claimed that he was disillusioned by the experience. Anderson formed a tag team with Pat Anderson, winning the NWA World Tag Team Championship with him in 1996.|$|E
2500|$|A week later, to {{alleviate}} this problem, Wolpaw returned with sample dialogue {{made with a}} text-to-speech program, which {{was intended to be}} used as a series of messages relayed to the player in the relaxation vault, the first area of the game. The team liked the voice, describing it as [...] "funny" [...] and [...] "sinister", so Wolpaw decided to add this voice to other test chambers, all the while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> story elements. The developers noticed that play testers were more motivated by the voice because they became attached to it. As a result, the team decided to make GLaDOS the narrative voice of Portal. While designing GLaDOS, one of the rules that the writers had was that they would not make her seem like a computer, for example having her say, [...] "Oh my nuts and bolts." [...] While GLaDOS is physically a computer and speaks with a computerized voice, they intended her to speak to the player-character like a regular person.|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Children {{released}} their 22nd single [...] on January 1, 2002, {{which was}} used as a show song in the Japanese drama [...] Four months later their tenth original album It's a Wonderful World was released on May 10, the groups' tenth anniversary. The release of the album on their 10th anniversary was not something that had originally intended. As the group was wrapping up recording, Sakurai asked if the album could be released in the spring time. While the group and their management was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> how to promote an album in the spring time, they came up with releasing the album on their 10th anniversary. A new tour, titled Mr. Children Tour 2002 Dear Wonderful World was set to begin later that year. The previous single [...] "I'll Be" [...] from the Discovery album was selected to be used as an official theme for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, held in Japan and South Korea. On May 24, 2002 Mr. Children attended the first ever MTV Video Music Awards Japan and topped the awards show by winning 'Video of the year' for the song [...] "Kimi ga suki". Two months after the release of the new album, Mr.Children's 23rd single [...] "Any", was released on July 11, 2002 and used to promote [...] Group 10th Anniversary. The group was not able to properly promote the single. As preparations for the new tour were beginning and promotion for the new single were being done, lead singer Sakurai was hospitalized on July 21, 2002, after a blockage in his cerebellum was detected. The Mr. Children Tour 2002 Dear Wonderful World was canceled and all group activities were put on a temporary hiatus. While recovering, Sakurai wrote a song called [...] "Hero", that was inspired by his hospitalization. The song was released as the group's 24th single on December 11, 2002 and was used in [...] Group 10th Anniversary commercial. The first press version of the single included a DVD where, in addition to a Mr. Children 2002 documentary -Hero- that was aired, the singer talked about his hospitalization and inspiration for the song. On November 15, 2002 Mr.Children's website announced the band's return to the stage for a [...] "stew of home pride" [...] with a one night only live, [...] December 21, 2002 the group returned to the stage for a single concert, later released on DVD, titled Wonederful World on Dec. 21.|$|E
