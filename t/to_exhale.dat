5|$|As in {{all other}} tetrapods, mammals have a larynx that can quickly open and close to produce sounds, and a supralaryngeal vocal tract which filters this sound. The lungs and {{surrounding}} musculature provide the air stream and pressure required to phonate. The larynx controls the pitch and volume of sound, but the strength the lungs exert <b>to</b> <b>exhale</b> also contributes to volume. More primitive mammals, such as the echidna, can only hiss, as sound is achieved solely through exhaling through a partially closed larynx. Other mammals phonate using vocal folds, {{as opposed to the}} vocal cords seen in birds and reptiles. The movement or tenseness of the vocal folds can result in many sounds such as purring and screaming. Mammals can change the position of the larynx, allowing them to breathe through the nose while swallowing through the mouth, and to form both oral and nasal sounds; nasal sounds, such as a dog whine, are generally soft sounds, and oral sounds, such as a dog bark, are generally loud.|$|E

40|$|Background: Exhaled {{nitric oxide}} (NO) is {{a marker of}} eosinophilic steroid-sensitive {{inflammation}} in the airways of patients with respiratory disease. Moreover, information about the localization of inflammation in the respiratory tree is obtained by estimates of bronchial and alveolar contributions <b>to</b> <b>exhaled</b> NO. Aims: The main aim of this thesis was to identify the determinants of exhaled NO, as well as determinants of bronchial and alveolar contributions <b>to</b> <b>exhaled</b> NO in health and disease. Smoking history, degree of IgE sensitization and effects of modulating the pharyngo-oral tract production of NO were specifically studied in this context. Other specific aims were to determine the association of exhaled NO {{with the presence of}} asthma and pulmonary hypertension (PH). Methods: Both population-based studies and experimental studies have been performed within the frame of the thesis. The population-based studies are based on data from the European Community Respiratory Health Survey II. NO measurements at several exhalation flow rates were performed in order to estimate alveolar and bronchial contributions <b>to</b> <b>exhaled</b> NO. Results: Both current and previous smoking were associated with decreased exhaled NO and bronchial NO flux levels. Alveolar NO concentrations were decreased in current smokers. The degree of IgE sensitization was positively related to the levels of exhaled NO and its bronchial contribution. <b>Exhaled</b> NO appeared <b>to</b> be a more specific marker of allergic inflammation than of rhinitis or asthma. Both allergic and non-allergic asthma were associated with increased exhaled NO levels, but only in never-smoking persons. The estimated alveolar NO increased after ingestion of nitrate in individuals with high nitrate turnover in the pharyngo-oral tract. Pulmonary arterial hypertension, but not other forms of PH, was associated with decreased bronchial NO flux, whereas PH of all etiologies was related to increased alveolar NO concentrations. Conclusion: Smoking history and IgE sensitization, that are known determinants of exhaled NO, affected the bronchial and alveolar contributions <b>to</b> <b>exhaled</b> NO differently. The limitations of the simple NO pulmonary exchange models were highlighted by the paradoxical effects on estimated alveolar NO when modulating the NO production proximally, in the pharyngo-oral tract. Predominance of non-eosinophilic inflammation in ever-smoking patients with asthma could explain the poor association between the presence of asthma and exhaled NO in these patients. Different pathophysiological changes in terms of bronchial NO production and exchange were related to the etiology of pulmonary hypertension...|$|R
40|$|Background: Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} about risk of exposure <b>to</b> <b>exhaled</b> aerosols <b>to</b> ICU personnel. AIM: To quantify amount of aerosol {{collected at the}} exhaust outlet of mechanical ventilators operated with and without filters in the expiratory limb. Methods: Two categories of ventilators were tested: (1) Ventilators without Proprietary Filters: Servo-i (Maquet) and Galileo (Hamilton) and (2) Ventilator with proprietary filters: PB 840 (Covidien). Each ventilator was attached to a simple test lung and operated with VT 500 ml, RR 20 bpm, PIF 50 L/min, PEEP 5 cmH 2 O. Four separate doses of albuterol (2. 5 mg/ 3 mL) were administered via jet nebuliser (eValueMed, Tri-anim) placed at the “Y”. In Experiment A, a filter (Respirgard 303) was placed at the exhaust port. In Experiment B, two filters were attached to the ventilators without proprietary filters: (1) {{at the end of}} expiratory limb and (2) at the exhaust outlet. Drug was eluted from filters and measured using spectrophotometry. Results: Drug deposited at the exhaust port without expiratory filtering was 3 ̆e 160 fold higher than with expiratory filtering. The collecting filter used in this study was less efficient than the proprietary filter designed for use with the ventilator. Regardless of type of filter used, placement of filter in the expiratory limb reduced secondhand aerosol exposure significantly.

40|$|RATIONALE: Metabolomic {{analysis}} provides biochemical {{profiles of}} low-molecular-weight endogenous metabolites in biological fluids. OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the feasibility of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) -based metabolomic analysis applied <b>to</b> <b>exhaled</b> breath condensate ("breathomics"). Information coming from NMR spectra was analyzed with a view to establish the NMR variables that best discriminate between children with asthma and healthy children. METHODS: Twenty-five children with asthma (17 with persistent asthma treated with inhaled corticosteroids, 8 with intermittent asthma inhaled corticosteroid naive; age, 7 - 15 yr) and 11 healthy age-matched control subjects were enrolled. Every child performed exhaled nitric oxide measurement, spirometry, and condensate collection. Condensate samples were analyzed by means of NMR spectroscopy. Linear and partial least squares discriminant analyses were applied to data obtained from the NMR spectra. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The combination of exhaled nitric oxide and FEV(1) discriminates children with asthma and healthy children with a success rate of approximately 81 %, whereas selected signals from NMR spectra offer a slightly better discrimination (approximately 86 %). The selected NMR variables derive from the region of 3. 2 to 3. 4 ppm, indicative of oxidized compounds, and from the region of 1. 7 to 2. 2 ppm, indicative of acetylated compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolomics can be applied <b>to</b> <b>exhaled</b> breath condensate, leading to the characterization of airway biochemical fingerprints. The presence of acetylated compounds suggests new metabolic pathways that may have a role in asthma pathophysiology...|$|R

40|$|Background: Breathing, {{a part of}} respiration, is one of {{the vital}} functions. Breathing {{disorders}} are common in the elderly. An effective breathing sensor for real-time detection of apnea is important in clinical critical care. We aimed to construct a real-time warning platform with a combination of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and related nano-electromechanical system (NEMS) for elderly care. Methods: Through a specific acid-treated procedure, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were immobilized on a thin silicon dioxide (SiO 2) film, coated on a heated silicon wafer. Techniques of photolithography and sputtering with chromium and gold were then implemented on the MWCNT film to develop micro-interdigitated electrodes as a base for the breathing sensor. The sensor was equipped with a programmed microchip processor to become a warning detector for abnormal human breathing, namely less than six breaths per minute. Elderly volunteers were enrolled for examining the effective sensitivity of this novel electromechanical device. Results: There were 15 elderly volunteers (9 males and 6 females) tested in this experiment. The dynamic analyses of the MWCNT sensor <b>to</b> <b>exhaled</b> breath showed that it had characteristics of rapid response, high aspect ratio, small tip ratio, and high electrical conductivity. Responses of the MWCNT sensor <b>to</b> <b>exhaled</b> breath was recorded according to different performance parameters, i. e., strength, frequency, flow rate, and breath components. In this study, variable pattern-simulated tests showed that a MWCNT sensor combined with a processor could accurately evoke warning signals (100 % of sensitivity rate), indicating its effectiveness and usefulness for detecting abnormal breathing rates, especially apnea. Conclusion: Our results showed that a new device composed of an NEMS by combining an MWCNT sensor and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits could be integrated to effectively detect apnea in the elderly. This novel device may improve the pattern of safe respiratory care for the elderly in the future...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hydrogen {{peroxide}} (H 2 O 2) in {{exhaled air}} condensate is elevated in inflammatory disorders {{of the lower}} respiratory tract. It is unknown whether viral colds contribute <b>to</b> <b>exhaled</b> H 2 O 2. AIM: <b>To</b> assess <b>exhaled</b> H 2 O 2 during and after a common cold. METHODS: We examined H 2 O 2 in the breath condensate of 20 normal subjects with acute symptoms of a common cold and after recovery 2 weeks later and, similarly, in 10 subjects without infection. H 2 O 2 was measured with a fluorimetric assay. RESULTS: At the time of infection exhaled H 2 O 2 (median, ranges) was 0. 20 microM (0. 03 - 1. 2 microM), and this decreased to 0. 09 microM (< 0. 01 - 0. 40 microM) after recovery (p = 0. 006).
