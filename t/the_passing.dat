5000|$|Native {{inhabitants}} of the Alps were naturally {{the first to use}} <b>the</b> <b>passes.</b> <b>The</b> <b>passes</b> first became known to the outside world when the Romans crossed them to raid or conquer the region beyond. Romans, once having found an [...] "easy" [...] way across the chain, did not trouble to seek for harder and more devious routes. Hence, passes that can be shown as certainly known to them are relatively few in number: they are, in topographical order from west to east, the Col de l'Argentiere, the Col de Montgenèvre, the col du Mont Cenis, the two St Bernard passes (Little St Bernard Pass and Great St. Bernard <b>Pass),</b> <b>the</b> Splügen <b>Pass,</b> <b>the</b> Septimer <b>Pass,</b> <b>the</b> Reschen <b>Pass,</b> <b>the</b> Brenner <b>Pass,</b> <b>the</b> Plöcken <b>Pass,</b> <b>the</b> Pontebba <b>Pass</b> (or Saifnitz <b>Pass),</b> <b>the</b> Radstädter Tauern <b>Pass</b> and <b>the</b> Solkscharte <b>Pass</b> or Sölk Pass.|$|R

5|$|George's {{distrust}} of the Tories aided <b>the</b> <b>passing</b> of power to the Whigs.

After the election, the Whig-dominated Parliament passed the Septennial Act 1715, which extended the maximum duration of Parliament to seven years (although it could be dissolved earlier by the Sovereign). Thus Whigs already in power could remain in such a position for a greater period of time.|$|E
