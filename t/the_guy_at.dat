So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E

However, in 2002 editor Simon Wright {{resigned}} as {{he believed that}} the managing director of The Automobile Association intervened to prevent Pétrus from receiving a fifth rosette at the recommendation of the AA's inspectors. Ramsay reacted by threatening to take legal action {{in order to ensure that}} none of his restaurants were featured in the 2003 edition of the AA's restaurant guide. This was followed by the resignation of inspector Sarah Peart over the same issue. The AA eventually relented and awarded Pétrus five rosettes. Wareing said of the issue at the time, [...] "I'm delighted to get the fifth rosette, it's a great achievement. Every AA inspector believed we deserved five rosettes, it was only <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>at</b> the top, Roger Wood, who didn't. As far as I know, he still has not eaten at Pétrus and I would not welcome him here now." ...|$|E
