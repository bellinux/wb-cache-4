5|$|After being re-established in December 1940, I./JG 1's primary {{responsibility}} was the air defence of Germany and its Northern occupied territories. In this role, the unit almost exclusively {{worked in the}} Netherlands prior to its transfer to central West Germany. Its main opponents through 1940–41 were therefore lone RAF reconnaissance aircraft, the anti-shipping aircraft of RAF Coastal Command and the medium bombers of RAF Bomber Command's 2 Group, although <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>would</b> see little action compared to other theaters during 1941. During this time, this sector was considered relatively safe compared to other theaters.|$|E
5|$|Coach Alexander found campus {{spirit to}} be {{particularly}} low following the Great Depression. His successful football program (and the other athletic teams) had very few student fans attending the games. He helped to establish a spirit organization known as the Yellow Jacket Club in 1930 to bolster student spirit. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>would</b> later become the Ramblin' Reck Club. The 1939 team was SEC co-champion.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, {{after months}} of public tensions, Bonamassa {{announced}} that he was no longer a member of Black Country Communion, with the question over whether <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>would</b> continue with another guitarist unclear. Days later, Hughes confirmed that the band was officially over, hinting that he would continue working with Bonham and Sherinian under a new collective name. Sherinian later joined Bonamassa's touring band, while Hughes and Bonham formed California Breed with guitarist Andrew Watt. Hughes and Bonamassa later reconciled and the band reunited in 2016, with fourth album BCCIV released in September 2017.|$|E

50|$|The league {{stage of}} the tournament {{consisted}} of four groups of four teams each.

5|$|Rumors {{spread that}} the strike was weakening. Volunteers and others not {{connected}} with the miners association took over the mine pumps, which had been abandoned by the miners, {{in order to prevent}} flooding of the tunnels. There were minor acts of violence. The Citizens' Corps prepared for a possible armed confrontation, drilled by those of its members who were Civil War veterans. The group used the mine company store owned by W. W. Scranton as their headquarters, after vacating two other locations because owners feared the presence of <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>would</b> attract violence.|$|E
5|$|The {{company also}} joined {{the joint venture}} Commuter Service along with other Norwegian {{regional}} airlines, Coast Aero Center, Mørefly and Trønderfly. The intention {{was to create a}} cooperative company which could compete in a more diversified market. The group's lawyer stated that the organizational structure among regional airlines was 15 years out of date and that <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>would</b> take market shares in a growing market, especially by starting new niche direct services.|$|E
5|$|The {{day before}} the second Battle of Kellogg's Grove, June 24, Black Hawk was leading his band in an attack on Apple River Fort. During the Battle of Apple River Fort the Sauk besieged the small stockade {{for much of the}} day. Other warriors were {{dispatched}} to gather food, horses and other supplies, all of which were badly needed by the band. The following day <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>would</b> reach Kellogg's Grove where they would engage Dement's militia forces.|$|E

Thus a 30-year mortgage is transformed into bonds of various lengths suitable for various investors with various goals.|$|R
50|$|In {{teams with}} groups {{with more than}} 16 teams, matches against the teams placed 17th and 18th in each of <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>would</b> not be {{included}} in the ranking of the second-placed teams. The best runner-up will qualify for the Copa de Campeones.|$|R
5|$|To address crime, {{the party}} seeks to deport foreign offenders, extend {{neighborhood}} watch schemes {{and hold a}} referendum on restoring capital punishment in the UK. It has further pledged to invest £2.5 billion into the police service, promising to recruit 10,000 more officers. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>would</b> reform education policy by aiming to cut school class sizes and scrapping tuition fees for UK students attending British universities; conversely, all foreign students {{would be required to}} pay in full.|$|E
5|$|After {{their water}} ran out, the Beck/Fiszer group {{developed}} a routine whereby {{some of the}} group worked to dig a well, while others watched out for approaching Germans, and yet others ventured outside the bunker to scavenge for useful items. The group eventually dug their way to two water canals and built a well. On November 17, during an excursion outside the bunker, the group made contact with a small partisan unit, also in hiding, led by a Russian soldier POW who had been liberated during the uprising. Subsequently, several of <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>would</b> join the partisans for small scale attacks on German troops. The group survived until the entry of the Red Army in mid-January.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the only}} {{galleries}} who {{were prepared to}} show the so-called New York School (Robert Motherwell's term) were Parsons Gallery, the Samuel Kootz Gallery and the Charles Egan Gallery. To these fledgling galleries it was a financial disaster. The highest price paid for a Pollock, before 1947, was $740 and Rothko had peaked with {{the sale of a}} $120 painting in 1946. At the Kootz Gallery, from 1946 to 1948, Hans Hoffman, William Baziotes and Robert Motherwell were offered at between $100 and $950, likely fetching much lower actual sales prices. Kootz closed in 1948 {{as a result of the}} financial strain. The critical and financial success of <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>would</b> only come after a series of popularising articles in Life magazine, most notably a feature on Jackson Pollock in 1949 and the Irascibles article and photograph of 1951.|$|E
30|$|Evident from Table  1 is {{the finding}} that the two {{agricultural}} types (rain-fed vs. irrigation) do differ from one another with respect to actual or planned practices. While only 52  % of <b>the</b> rain-fed <b>group</b> <b>would</b> harvest flood water for irrigation, 88  % of <b>the</b> irrigation <b>group</b> <b>would</b> do so. Conversely, 28  % of <b>the</b> rain-fed <b>group</b> <b>would</b> utilize groundwater. Eighty-one percent of <b>the</b> rain-fed <b>group</b> <b>would</b> capitalize on increased rainfall via irrigation while 53  % of <b>the</b> irrigation <b>group</b> said that they would irrigate more than at present. While 79  % of <b>the</b> irrigation <b>group</b> <b>would</b> maintain or increase their use of fertilizer, only 62  % of <b>the</b> rain-fed <b>group</b> indicated their intention to do so; at 28  %, a large percentage of <b>the</b> rain-fed <b>group</b> acknowledged an intention to vary crop types without the use of fertilizer. <b>The</b> two <b>groups</b> differed markedly with respect to their use of fertilizer. Nearly 20  % of <b>the</b> rain-fed <b>group</b> either never used fertilizer or did so less than once per year. Conversely, 95  % of <b>the</b> irrigation <b>group</b> reported applying fertilizer at least once per year. A two-sample t test (t =  5.99 with 168 df) to assess the difference between the rain-fed (mean =  1.79) and irrigation group (mean =  2.30) means was significantly different from zero at p <  0.001.|$|R
50|$|In 1909 the Social Democratic Union 'Proletarian' of Dimitar Blagoev (a {{group that}} had been {{expelled}} from the Narrow Socialists) merged into the Broad Socialist party. <b>The</b> <b>grouping</b> <b>would</b> function as a leftwing tendency inside the Broad Socialist party for the years to come.|$|R

5|$|During {{this time}} of great {{creativity}} for the British musical scene {{in the summer of}} 1967, Chris Curtis, former drummer of the beat band The Searchers, contacted London businessman Tony Edwards to find financing for a new group he was putting together, to be called Roundabout. The name meant that <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>would</b> contain a revolving cast of non-permanent members getting on and off the stage like a musical roundabout, with only Curtis as mainstay and singer. Impressed with the plan, Edwards agreed to finance and manage the venture with two business partners, Ron Hire and John Coletta, and the three of them founded Hire-Edwards-Coletta (HEC) Enterprises.|$|E
5|$|On April 19, the VPAF Command {{was ordered}} to prepare for an {{operation}} in South Vietnam, so a group of pilots from the 4th Squadron of the VPAF 923rd Fighter Regiment was selected to undertake conversion training in Da Nang and form a new squadron for the operation. The selected group was led by Upper Captain Nguyen Van Luc along with Tu De, Tran Cao Thang, Han Van Quang and Hoang Mai Vuong. Together with former Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilots Trung and On, <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>would</b> form the Quyet Thang ("Determined to Win") Squadron. On April 22 the VPAF pilots arrived at Da Nang Air Base and they began training on two A-37 aircraft that were restored to flying condition with support from Trung, On, Xanh and a few captured South Vietnamese technicians. In just five days, the VPAF pilots were able to independently fly the A-37 without support from the former Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilots.|$|E
5|$|Reactivated on 5 May 1947 at Fort Lewis, Washington, {{the unit}} officially became the 36th Engineer Group on 10 April 1953. During the Korean War, the 36th Engineer Combat Group {{consisted}} of four engineer battalions and four additional engineer companies, earning two Meritorious Unit Citations and the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. It {{served in the}} Korean theater from 1950 until 1954, earning nine campaign streamers while supporting other army units in numerous engineering and construction projects, including rebuilding the Han river bridge just outside Seoul. During its assignment, the group was assigned to IX Corps of the Eighth United States Army. Projects that the group and its subordinate battalions completed included POW facilities, allied bases, and minefield clearing. Along {{with the rest of}} IX Corps, the group was forced back behind the Pusan Perimeter and remained stranded there until the Incheon Landings were conducted by X Corps. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>would</b> follow IX Corps {{for the remainder of the}} Korean war.|$|E

5|$|Seymour and {{his small}} group of new {{followers}} soon relocated {{to the home of}} Richard and Ruth Asberry at 216 North Bonnie Brae Street. White families from local holiness churches began to attend as well. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>would</b> get together regularly and pray to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. On April 9, 1906, after five weeks of Seymour's preaching and prayer, and three days into an intended 10-day fast, Edward S. Lee spoke in tongues for the first time. At the next meeting, Seymour shared Lee's testimony and preached a sermon on Acts 2:4 and soon six others began to speak in tongues as well, including Jennie Moore, who would later become Seymour's wife. A few days later, on April 12, Seymour spoke in tongues for the first time after praying all night long.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{shipping}} {{interests of}} Cunard, Blue Star Line and Ellerman Lines were subsequently formed {{into a separate}} operating company (Associated Container Transportation (Australia)) and following work by Smallpeice, the Australian government allowed the state owned Australian National Line to form a partnership with Associated Container Transportation (Australia). <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>would</b> go on to form the Pacific America Container Express which operated services between Australia and {{the east coast of}} North America via the Panama Canal. Smallpeice would serve as chairman of the Associated Container Transportation (Australia)/Australian National Line partnership from its creation in 1969 and as chairman of Associated Container Transportation (Australia) from 1971, retiring from both positions in February 1979.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1849 and 1850, they contended with Narciso López, the Venezuelan radical who led {{repeated}} filibustering expeditions in {{an attempt}} to conquer the island of Cuba. The annexation of Cuba was the object of fascination among many in the South, who saw in Cuba a potential new slave state, and López had several prominent Southern supporters. López made generous offers to American military leaders to support him, but Taylor and Clayton saw the enterprise as illegal. They issued a blockade, and later, authorized a mass arrest of López and his fellows, although <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>would</b> eventually be acquitted. They also confronted Spain, which had arrested several Americans on the charge of piracy, but the Spaniards eventually surrendered them to maintain good relations with the U.S.|$|E

5|$|Daara J, {{formed in}} 1997, was {{originally}} a trio {{that consisted of}} Faada Freddy, N'Dongo D and Lord Alajiiman. Lord Alajiiman performed and toured throughout {{the world with the}} group until 2008 when the group split. Since then, Alajiman evolves in a solo career while contributing {{to the development of the}} music sector in Senegal. Daara J was formed when all of its members were in high school, where they were studying accounting. The rappers were influenced by American hip hop artists such as Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five and Afrika Bambaataa but also listened to their parents' music, which included artists such as Sly and the Family Stone and Aretha Franklin, and musical styles which included Cuban music. Faada Freddy cites the group's major inspiration as Das EFX. Originally, the members took instrumentals of hip hop tracks from the United States and France to rap over. Later they purchased a drum machine, but even with this equipment, a member of <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>would</b> have to imitate the other instruments in the song with his voice. Positive Black Soul, another Senegalese rap group, encouraged Daara J to record and perform.|$|E
5|$|Destiny's Child {{went to a}} hiatus, {{following}} the release of their third studio album Survivor (2001), allowing {{each member of the}} group to release solo material. As each member had success with their individual projects, questions arose by the public whether they would record again as a group. However, group members Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams reunited again to work on their fourth studio album Destiny Fulfilled. The album was released in late 2004 and the group further embarked on a worldwide tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It the following year as part of its promotion. During a concert the group had at the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona, Spain on June 11, 2005, Rowland announced to the audience that the tour would be Destiny's Child last together, revealing their formal disbandment. It was announced that after their final North American leg, <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>would</b> part ways, with each member continuing their music career as a solo act. During an interview, they explained that their disbandment was planned during the making of Destiny Fulfilled as they discussed their individual aspirations and realized that remaining as a group would prevent them in pursuing those interests. However, it was acknowledged that the album would not be their last album together.|$|E
5|$|He also {{missed the}} {{opportunity}} to lead the original Sinister Six because he felt that joining <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>would</b> mean admitting he needed the help of others to rid himself of Spider-Man. Although he later formed the 'Sinister Twelve' when Spider-Man sent him to prison, he expressed anger at Mac Gargan for acquiring the Venom symbiote rather than using the new Scorpion suit provided for him simply because Gargan was not doing what he wanted, despite Venom being {{more powerful than the}} Scorpion. When he participated in the mystical ritual known as the Gathering of Five, he appeared convinced that he would automatically receive the gift of power from the ritual– which would bestow upon the participants power, immortality, knowledge, madness and death, respectively– only to receive the gift of madness instead, subsequently requiring an elaborate cocktail of drugs to restore himself to a semblance of sanity. During his time in charge of H.A.M.M.E.R. he was provoked into attacking Asgard by his Goblin side because his ego couldn't allow himself to consider the possibility that the Asgardians wouldn't threaten his power. Later events revealed that Loki at least slightly influenced Osborn's decision to further Loki's own goals. During his attempted takeover of Earth's superhuman security defenses, he was shown reflecting that humans are all barbarians who require the strong like him to control them, dismissing the Avengers as no better than him despite the obvious distinction between Osborn's demands for power and the straightforward respect that the general public have for the Avengers.|$|E
