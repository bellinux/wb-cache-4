Male and female <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> the deaf were found to be significantly different in levels of job satisfaction. 3.

This included the printing works of Hua Sui (1439–1513), who pioneered the first Chinese bronze-type movable printing in the year 1490. In 1718, during the mid Qing Dynasty (1644–1912), the scholar of Tai'an known as Xu Zhiding developed movable type with enamelware instead of earthenware.
