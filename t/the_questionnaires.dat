Of <b>the</b> <b>questionnaires</b> sent out only 10% replied {{and some of the}} questioned directed a certain response. However, the inquiry was not supposed to be impartial, the commission wanted to change the existing system, and keeping the current system was not considered an option. <b>The</b> <b>questionnaires</b> used asked leading questions that were poorly framed leading to responses that were ambiguous or irrelevant.|$|E

30|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{consisting of}} items on motivation, anxiety, intended effort, and English language proficiency items plus items addressing biographical information, {{such as age}} and gender, was created. <b>The</b> <b>questionnaire</b> was two pages. <b>The</b> <b>questionnaire</b> was administered to students over a one-month period in 2016. <b>The</b> <b>questionnaire</b> {{was given to the}} teachers who had offered to help with data collection.

The students were made to understand that by completing <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> they were giving consent to the use of their data. Due to classroom time constraints some of the teachers gave students who were willing to participate <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> to take home and complete for the next class session.

For product LCAs at either the generic (i.e., representative industry averages) or brand-specific level, that data is typically collected through survey questionnaires.

25|$|Excessive {{drinkers}} self-reported more {{deficiencies in}} both short-term and long-term prospective memory on {{questions in the}} PRMQ. Chronic heavy alcohol users showed impaired performance on tasks including learning word lists, short- and long-term logical memory, general working memory, and abstract reasoning. Research has also accessed the effects of binge drinking on everyday prospective memory in adolescents. Binge drinkers and non-binge drinkers participated in two prospective memory sub-scales of the PRMQ. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>questionnaires,</b> the Prospective Remembering Video Procedure (PRVP) {{was used to test}} for an objective measure of prospective memory. It was shown that increasing the amount of alcohol consumed per week was correlated with poorer prospective memory performance on the PRVP, illustrating a damaging effect of excessive drinking upon everyday prospective memory for adolescents.|$|E
25|$|The {{commission}} members {{surveyed the}} history of execution and sent out a fact-finding questionnaire to government officials, lawyers, and medical experts all around the state asking for their opinion. <b>The</b> <b>questionnaires</b> were a bit skewed because they pushed forward electrocution and {{did not include the}} choice of abolishing the death penalty, but, despite that, a slight majority of respondents recommended hanging over electrocution, and a few recommended the abolition of capital punishment. The commission also contacted electrical experts, including Thomson-Houston Electric Company's Elihu Thomson (who recommended high voltage AC connected to the head and the spine) and the inventor Thomas Edison (who also recommended AC, as well as using a Westinghouse generator). They also attended electrocutions of dogs by George Fell who had worked with Southwick in the early 1880s experiments. Fell was conducting further experiments, electrocuting anesthetized dissected dogs trying to discern exactly how electricity killed a subject.|$|E
25|$|The {{deadline}} to submit {{applications for the}} 2016 Summer Olympic Games was September 13, 2007. The seven cities that submitted bids before that date also met the January 14, 2008 deadline for submission of the first phase questionnaire. Through analysis of <b>the</b> <b>questionnaires,</b> the IOC gave a weighted-average score to each city based on the scores obtained {{in each of the}} questionnaire's eleven themes: political and social support, general infrastructure, sports venues, Olympic Village, environment, accommodation, transport, security, past experience, finance, and legacy. If a bid's score was higher than six (IOC's predefined benchmark score), the city was considered highly capable of hosting the Games; otherwise, its chances were very slim. On June 4, 2008, the IOC announced the cities accepted as candidates: Four of the five highest-rated applicants progressed to the next phase as official candidate cities. As stipulated, the IOC granted them the right to use the Olympic rings on their candidature emblem, together with a label identifying each as a Candidate City. The International Olympic Committee went against precedent when it selected Rio de Janeiro over Doha—a city which scored higher yet was eliminated from the field. Doha's weaknesses of a small population, lack of facilities, and Games dates outside of the IOC's desired window may have been too large an obstacle for the IOC to accept. Typically, the IOC selects all the top scoring bids which reach the established minimum benchmark.|$|E

2500|$|A 1992 survey {{studying}} father-daughter incest in Finland {{reported that}} of the 9,000 15-year-old high school girls who filled out <b>the</b> <b>questionnaires,</b> of the girls living with their biological fathers, 0.2% reported father-daughter incest experiences; of the girls living with a stepfather, 3.7% reported sexual experiences with him. The reported counts included only father-daughter incest and did not include prevalence of other forms of child sexual abuse. [...] The survey summary stated, [...] "the feelings of the girls about their incestual experiences are overwhelmingly negative." [...] Others argue that prevalence rates are much higher, and that many cases of child abuse are never reported. One study found that professionals failed to report approximately 40% of the child sexual abuse cases they encountered. A study by Lawson & Chaffin indicated that many children who were sexually abused were [...] "identified solely by a physical complaint that was later diagnosed as a venereal disease...Only 43% {{of the children who}} were diagnosed with venereal disease made a verbal disclosure of sexual abuse during the initial interview."

2500|$|Life {{satisfaction}} and Affect balance are generally measured separately and independently. [...] Life satisfaction is generally measured using a self-report method. A common measurement for life satisfaction is questionnaires. Affective balance is also generally measured using a self-report method. An {{example of a}} measurement of affective balance is the PANAS (Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule). [...] The issue with the current measurements of life {{satisfaction and}} affective balance {{is that they are}} self-reports. The problem with self-reports is that the participants may be lying or at least not telling the whole truth on <b>the</b> <b>questionnaires.</b> Participants may be lying or holding back from revealing certain things because they are either embarrassed or they may be filling in what they believe the researcher wants to see in the results. To gain more accurate results, other methods of measurement have been used to determine one’s SWB. Another way to corroborate or confirm that the self-report results are accurate is through informant reports. [...] Informant reports are given to the participant’s closest friends and family and they are asked to fill out either a survey or a form asking about the participants mood, emotions, and overall lifestyle. The participant may write in the self-report that they are very happy, however that participant’s friends and family record that he/she is always depressed. This would obviously be a contradiction in results which would ultimately lead to inaccurate results. Another method of gaining {{a better understanding of the}} true results is through ESM, or the Experience Sampling Method. [...] In this measure, participants are given a beeper/pager that will randomly ring throughout the day. Whenever the beeper/pager sounds, the participant will stop what he/she is doing and record the activity they are currently engaged in and their current mood and feelings. Tracking this over a period of a week or a month will give researchers a better understanding of the true emotions, moods, and feelings the participant is experiencing, and how these factors interact with other thoughts and behaviors. A third measurement to ensure validity is the Day Reconstruction Method. [...] In this measure, participants fill out a diary of the previous days’ activities. The participant is then asked to describe each activity and provide a report of how they were feeling, what mood they were experiencing, and any emotions that surfaced. Thus to ensure valid results, a researcher may tend to use self-reports along with another form of measurement mentioned above. Someone with a high level of life satisfaction and a positive affective balance is said to have a high level of SWB.|$|E
