The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate whether palpation of the knee could classify patients into those with and those without cold knees; whether this classification could be objectively validated using thermal imaging; whether the cold and not cold knee groups varied in response to a cold stress test and in patient-reported measures. Fifty eight patients were recruited; palpation classified them into cold and not cold groups. Twenty-one (36 %) patients were classified as having a cold knee by palpation: fourteen (36 %) females and seven males (37 %). Preliminary analysis suggested gender might be an effect modifier and the number of men was small, therefore the analysis focussed on females. Women with cold knees had a significantly smaller patellar skin fold, lower levels of activity and worse scores on the MFIQ, there also <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be an association with a traumatic onset.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this prospective multicenter study were {{to evaluate the use}} of vertical distraction osteogenesis in the correction of vertically deficient alveolar ridges and to evaluate whether the vertical bone gained by distraction osteogenesis was maintained over time when dental implants were placed in the distracted areas. Materials and Methods: Thirty-seven patients presenting vertically deficient edentulous ridges were treated in 4 different centers by means of distraction osteogenesis with an intraoral alveolar distractor. Two to 3 months after consolidation of the distracted segments, 138 dental implants were placed in the distracted areas. Four to 6 months later, abutments were connected and prosthetic loading of the implants began. Results: The mean follow-up after initial prosthetic loading was 34 months (range 15 to 55 months). The mean bone gain obtained by distraction was 9. 9 mm (range 4 to 15 mm). The cumulative success rate of the implants 4 years after the onset of prosthetic loading was 94. 2 %, while the implants’ cumulative survival rate was 100 %. No statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the different centers as far as survival and success rates of implants were concerned. Discussion and Conclusion: The results of <b>this</b> study <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> that distraction osteogenesis is a reliable technique for the correction of vertically deficient edentulous ridges.

40|$|Introduction and {{hypothesis}} The {{purpose of}} this study was to evaluate the effects of a pelvic floor muscle (PFM) rehabilitation program on the striated urethral sphincter in women over 60 years with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). We hypothesized that the PFM rehabilitation program would also exercise the striated urethral sphincter and that this would be demonstrated by hypertrophy of the sphincter on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods Women with at least weekly episodes of SUI were recruited. Participants were evaluated before and after a 12 -week group PFM rehabilitation intervention with T 2 -weighted fast-spin-echo MRI sequences recorded in the axial plane at rest to assess urethral sphincter size. Data on SUI symptoms and their bother were also collected. No control group was included. Results Seventeen women participated in the study. The striated urethral sphincter increased significantly in thickness (21 %, p[*]<[*] 0. 001), cross-sectional area (20 %, p[*]=[*] 0. 003), and volume (12 %, p[*]=[*] 0. 003) following the intervention. The reported number of incontinence episodes and their bother also decreased significantly. Conclusions <b>This</b> study <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> that PFM training for SUI also trains the striated urethral sphincter and that improvement in incontinence signs and symptoms is associated with sphincter hypertrophy in older women with SUI. These findings support previous ultrasound (US) data showing an increase in urethral cross-sectional area following PFM training and extend the previous findings by more specifically assessing the area of hypertrophy and by demonstrating that older women present the same changes as younger women when assessed using MRI data...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} aspect of the patellar taping technique, a common treatment for patellofemoral pain is the assessment of patellar position. The inter-tester reliability of the assessment method has been regarded as poor, as has the validity (Powers et al. 1999). The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine inter-tester reliability of a group of trained manual physiotherapists. This was achieved using a clinical measurement to assess the medial/lateral orientation of the patella and compare these findings against a known criterion valid measurement of patella position. Twenty experienced manual physiotherapists evaluated medial/lateral orientation of the patella. The findings of the clinical assessment were then compared to the position of the patella as determined through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI and the clinical assessment were carried out on the right knee of a single subject, who was supine with the knee in 20 degree flexion with the quadriceps relaxed. Both measures found the patella to be laterally displaced. Using the clinical method the mean difference between medial and lateral measurements was 6. 4 mm (+/- 3. 9 mm). The MRI measure of lateral patella displacement found the patella to be displaced 5 mm laterally. The inter-tester reliability of the clinical test showed good agreement, r = 0. 91 for the medial measure and r = 0. 94 for the lateral measure. The agreement between the clinical and MRI measures was (r = 0. 9) which was also a significant agreement. <b>This</b> study <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> that experienced manual physiotherapists can reliably measure relative patella medial/lateral position...|$|R
40|$|Thigmotropism (contour sensing) {{has been}} {{assigned}} {{an important role in}} both plant and human fungal pathogens. However, outside these systems, our knowledge of the function of thigmotropism in fungal growth control is relatively poor. Furthermore, the effects of environmental stress on thigmotropic responses have received scant attention. To try to elucidate some of the mechanisms behind hyphal contour sensing in response to nutrient-poor environments, we have used micro-engineered substrates and several imaging techniques to investigate the thigmotropic reactions of the ubiquitous fungus Aspergillus niger. <b>This</b> organism not <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> thigmotropic growth under normal conditions. Our results show that A. niger undergoes significant morphological changes during growth on solid substrates and demonstrate that the intensity of contour sensing varies depending on the area of the hyphal tip which initiates contact with the substrate. We propose that growth under nutrient-limited conditions triggers several factors that combine to increase thigmotropic sensitivity while conversely creating a 60 ° arc at the hyphal tip which is blind to topographical variations. This has important consequences for our general understanding of the hyphal mode of growth in fungi as well as more specific aspects of hyphal tip development under stress...|$|R
40|$|Particle-γ {{coincidence}} {{data can}} be used as a strong tool for studying low energy nuclear structure. The STARS-LIBERACE array at the 88 -Inch Cyclotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory was used to study gadolinium isotopes straddling the N = 90 shape change region. A 25 Me V proton beam was impinged upon 154 Gd and 158 Gd targets. The gadolinium isotopes 152, 153, 154, 156, 157, 158 Gd were studied following the (p,p'), (p,d) and (p,t) neutron transfer reactions. The primary focus of this work is to study the structure of and identify single- neutron quasi-particle states in the odd N Gd nuclei following the (p, d) reactions. Nu- merous new levels are observed in both 153 Gd and 157 Gd and multiple new, rays have been observed and associated with these and other previously known levels. A large excitation energy gap between approximately 500 keV and 1500 keV is observed in the level schemes of both nuclei where very few states are populated. <b>This</b> gap <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> the persisting influence of the N = 64 spherical sub-shell closure to inter- mediate deformations. It is striking that such an effect is apparent when probed from so far above (i. e. ~ 30 neutrons away). The secondary focus of this work is upon the angular momentum transferred to the statistical continuum region of these nuclei via different light ion transfer reactions, i. e. between approximately 2 Me V and the neutron separation energy. The angular momen- tum transferred via (p,d) and (p,t) reactions populating 157 Gd and 156 Gd respectively was measured using two independent techniques. The first technique involves studying the,-ray decay path within the residual nucleus, the second technique involves measur- ing the angular distribution of the light ions following the reaction. The two techniques are in good agreement and <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> verify each other. The measured angular momen- tum transferred via the (p,t) reaction is measured to be a distribution centered around ΔL = 4 - 5 h. The angular momentum transferred via the (p,d) reaction is slightly lower and is closer to ΔL = 4 h. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Texas {{like many}} states {{is facing a}} teacher shortage. The author {{suggests}} that the teacher shortage {{should be considered in}} light of the diverse school population. Across states {{there is a need for}} well-prepared teachers to work with linguistically and culturally diverse school populations. Thus, areas such as bilingual education continue to be critical shortage areas. While different attempts are currently underway to increase the number of preservice bilingual educators, another way districts have addressed this issue is to employ foreign-trained teachers as paraprofessionals or as teachers. Recently, Texas passed a regulation that would allow legally residing foreign-trained teachers to become certified Texas teachers upon passing the appropriate teacher competency exams and demonstrating English proficiency. The passing of <b>this</b> "fast-track" regulation <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> that the state board is thinking out of the box by tapping into a community's resources and acknowledging that immigrants can offer the community services beyond menial tasks. However, the researcher cautions that such actions may not increase the number of teachers and may not assure teacher quality. To support this notion, the researcher offers an analysis of a university's experience with the integration of legally residing foreign-trained Mexican teachers in their bilingual education teacher preparation program. The researcher posits that increasing the number of qualified teachers does require for entities to think out of the box, such as tapping into a community's natural resources; nevertheless, any plan of action should be critically examined and deliberated...|$|R
40|$|Snapper (Sparidae: Chrysophrys auratus) are a {{demersal}} teleost, and {{are one of}} {{the most}} abundant and ecologically important species inhabiting coastal New Zealand waters. They are highly valued both commercially and recreationally, and are under continuing pressure from intensive fishing efforts. This has led to declines in genetic diversity amongst populations, changes in the ecosystem structure of reef communities, and a significant reduction in stock biomass. Lipids and fatty acids are fundamentally important for growth, as sources of metabolic energy, in the structure and integrity of cell membranes and as endogenous energy reserves for the purpose of reproduction. Within a population, the quantity and concentration of an individual’s lipids and fatty acids can vary significantly. During reproduction, older and larger individuals can produce larvae that are larger, grow faster and survive periods of starvation for longer, compared to larvae of smaller, younger individuals, due in part to a greater provisioning of energy rich and biologically important lipids. The composition of lipids may also vary; an important aspect as lipids such as triglycerides and certain fatty acids, play more integral roles than others in developmental processes. It has been alleged that maternal age can have profound impacts on embryonic, larval and juvenile survival, growth rates, and functionality. We investigated triglyceride and fatty acid profiles of female New Zealand snapper/tamure (Chrysophrys auratus) across age, size, and condition, throughout its spawning season between November 2015 and February 2016. A total of 113 Chrysophrys auratus were sourced from the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park, North Island east coast, New Zealand. Individuals were measured, aged and histologically staged, before High Pressure Liquid Chromatography was used to determine triglyceride concentrations in female liver and gonad tissue, and Gas Chromatography to determine fatty acid concentrations in female gonad tissue. Results determined that maternal influences such as size, age, and condition, are not influencing lipid composition or concentrations. Therefore, the quality of oocytes is likely to be comparable across the population, placing importance on larger individuals whose fecundity is exponentially greater than that of their smaller counterparts. In addition <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> snapper <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> a tendency towards a capital breeding strategy, using (to some degree) stored lipid reserves to fund reproductive needs across multiple spawning events. This removes any reliance on specific food sources being available at specific times, and affords adaptability in the timing of spawning, enabling reproduction to take place when it is environmentally optimum, and has likely been a contributing factor in the success and abundance of this species...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: One of {{the most}} common risks taken by {{adolescents}} is binge drinking. There is an authenticated test in the detection of binge drinking: AUDIT-C (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test- Consumption). The object {{of this study is to}} evaluate the relevance of the test in the early detection of binge drinking in adolescent consultation in general practice. Method: This is a descriptive quantitative cross study. 103 general practitioners, who are all placement tutors in Haute Normandy, were part of the study. They were asked to test ail the adolescents aged 14 to 18 that they saw in general consultation, over a period of 2 weeks. The study took the form of 2 standard questionnaires. The first questionnaire was used each time an adolescent was seen in consultation and included AUDIT-C. The second questionnaire was ta be filled up at the end of the 2 -week study period. Results: The reply rate was 34 %. 142 adolescents were tested. 10 % of patients were detected to be binge drinkers. Ta the question "had you previously taiked about the subject of alcohol with your patient'?" 87 % of the doctors said "no". To the question "if the test is positive, is it the source of discovering alcohol abuse previously unknown to you?" 86 % of the doctors said "yes". To the question "Did you get the feeling that this test was intrusive during consultation?" 91 % of the doctors said "no". 97 % of the doctors thought the test was quick. The test <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be helpful in the early detection of binge drinking in adolescents ta 89 % of the doctors.

40|$|Flow (peak performance) and {{mindfulness}} (nonjudgemental present-moment awareness) <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be conceptually {{closely related}} to one another (e. g., Gardner & Moore, 2004). Theoretically, self-talk can be reasoned to {{play a key role}} in influencing the afore mentioned constructs. The interconnectivity of these three key variables of interest is illustrated and explained in a proposed overarching theoretical framework. Therefore, the main purpose of the current correlational study was to explore the relationships between flow, mindfulness, and self-talk, at the dispositional level. 212 international participants with experience in competitive sports completed an on-line questionnaire comprising the Dispositional Flow Scale 2 (DFS- 2; Jackson & Eklund, 2004), the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ; Baer et al., 2006), and the Automatic Self-Talk Questionnaire for Sports (ASTQS; Zourbanos et al., 2009). Results confirmed the moderate, positive connection between flow and mindfulness (r =. 44). Moreover, linear regression analysis indicated that mindfulness <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> significantly predict flow (F = 50. 395 [1, 211], p <. 001). Furthermore, negative- and positive self-talk correlated moderately with both flow (r = -. 52 and r =. 59, respectively) and mindfulness (r = -. 45 and r =. 23, respectively). Additionally, self-talk (negative and positive combined) significantly predicted flow and mindfulness, accounting for 51 % and 22 % of the variance, respectively. Investigating potential gender differences in terms of dispositional flow, mindfulness, and self-talk, was a secondary aim of the present study. Significant gender differences were found for every variable of interest; in <b>this</b> sample, men <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> higher levels of flow, mindfulness, and positive self-talk, and lower levels of negative self-talk, in comparison to women. In sum, the examined triangle of concepts <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be considerably interconnected, illustrated by moderate to strong correlations and significant predictions. The findings of the present study suggest that these novel avenues of research merit further, closer attention in future studies; especially, making use of experimental designs (intervention-based), more homogenous groups, and deeper analysis of sub-scales. Lastly, future research could benefit greatly from looking into the potential mediating influence mindfulness has on self-talk, and consequently how these two concepts affect athletic peak performance, flow...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} some of {{the factors}} that affect the expression of libido in beef cattle, focusing on the male and the free-ranging situation. The ways in which bull libido is assessed and the relationship between libido test results and fertility are discussed. Genetics play a role in determining libido, but there are many environmental factors affecting its expression, and a number of these factors influence sexual activity in both tests of libido and paddock mating. Herd fertility is multi-factorial and, consequently, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the relationship between libido and fertility. Multiple males increase the expression of libido, but it is uncertain whether this translates into improvements in herd fertility. However, there are consequences for individual bull fertility, as there is ample evidence of inherent differences between bulls. Male:female ratios <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> have minor effects on libido and fertility. Anecdotal evidence indicates that multiple matings with the same or different bulls may reduce the duration of oestrus. Social relationships between bulls can affect the expression of libido, with subordinate bulls being inhibited by the presence of dominant bulls. There is evidence that dominant bulls may achieve more matings at pasture, but this is not necessarily shown in their fertility. Older bulls show greater expression of libido in tests and appear more efficient in serving, although these changes may reflect greater sexual experience. Provided bulls are sexually mature and physically able to mate, age per se <b>appears</b> not <b>to</b> affect fertility, but age interacts with dominance, which can influence fertility. There is evidence of breed differences in expression of libido, but <b>this</b> <b>appears</b> not <b>to</b> be <b>demonstrated</b> in fertility. There is anecdotal evidence that bulls and females prefer to mate with similar genotypes/phenotypes with implications for fertility. Limited research on thermal and nutritional effects indicate some adverse consequences for libido of climatic extremes for unadapted bulls and of over-feeding, but not under-feeding. Limited research has investigated the effects on libido and fertility of multiple stressors associated with relocation; relocation to dramatically different environments has long-lasting detrimental consequences for fertility. Too few studies have been conducted to draw conclusions about the effects of topography and herd dispersion on libido and fertility. Temperament is likely to affect the expression of libido when animals are put into new situations, but this has not been critically researched. In the light of this review, the implications for managing cattle to optimise fertility are discussed and suggestions made as to areas where further research is needed...|$|R
