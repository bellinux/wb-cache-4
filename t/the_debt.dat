50|$|Her {{acquisition}} of lands {{was an unusual}} degree of economic activity for any medieval noblewoman, let alone a queen - {{and the level of}} her activity was exceptional by any standard: between 1274 and 1290 she acquired estates worth above £2500 yearly. In fact, it was Edward himself who initiated this process and his ministers helped her. He wanted the queen to hold lands sufficient for her financial needs without drawing on funds needed for government. One of his methods to help Eleanor acquire land was to give her <b>the</b> <b>debts</b> Christian landlords owed Jewish moneylenders. In exchange for cancelling <b>the</b> <b>debts,</b> she received <b>the</b> lands pledged for <b>the</b> <b>debts.</b> <b>The</b> debtors were often glad to rid themselves of <b>the</b> <b>debts,</b> and profited from the favour Eleanor showed them afterwards; she granted many of them, for life, lands worth as much as the estates they had surrendered to her, and some of them became her household knights.|$|R

Prime Minister Trygve Bratteli commented that private debt financing would have to compete with <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> taken up by the government on other railway projects, since politicians had to see the national economy as a whole, and that private financing would not allow more lines to be built.

In addition to the unpaid taxes, Nelson's situation was worsened by the weak investments he had made during the early 1980s. In 1978, after he fired Reshen, Nelson was introduced by Dallas lawyer Terry Bray to the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. To repay <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> Reshen had created with the IRS, Nelson was recommended to invest in tax shelters that ultimately flopped.
