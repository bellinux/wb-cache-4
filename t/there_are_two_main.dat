5|$|In mathematics, {{constructions of}} {{mathematical}} objects are needed, {{which is also}} the case for stochastic processes, to prove that they exist mathematically. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>main</b> approaches for constructing a stochastic process. One approach involves considering a measurable space of functions, defining a suitable measurable mapping from a probability space to this measurable space of functions, and then deriving the corresponding finite-dimensional distributions.|$|E
5|$|Myrrh is a bitter-tasting, aromatic, {{yellow to}} reddish brown gum.

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>main</b> themes {{running through}} the {{different}} discourses. One is the traditional theme of the early hesychasts and mystical theologians of the Christian East, especially the practices of faith (praxis) and asceticism (askesis) that they frequently taught as the way to reach direct experience of God (theoria). Specific practices discussed by Symeon include: repentance, detachment, renunciation, mercy, sorrow for sins, faith, and contemplation.|$|E

5|$|Two {{types of}} neuron play {{dominant}} {{roles in the}} cerebellar circuit: Purkinje cells and granule cells. Three types of axons also play dominant roles: mossy fibers and climbing fibers (which enter the cerebellum from outside), and parallel fibers (which are the axons of granule cells). <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>main</b> pathways through the cerebellar circuit, originating from mossy fibers and climbing fibers, both eventually terminating in the deep cerebellar nuclei.|$|E
5|$|As is {{discussed}} below, {{the reason for}} the delay was probably simply that neither the Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially. This then raises the question of why the battle occurred when it did. Herodotus explicitly tells us that the Greeks attacked the Persians (and the other sources confirm this), {{but it is not clear}} why they did this before the arrival of the Spartans. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>main</b> theories to explain this.|$|E

5|$|Locomotion {{abilities}} are best studied for Tyrannosaurus and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>main</b> issues concerning this: {{how well it}} could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been.Tyrannosaurus may {{have been slow to}} turn, possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45°– an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tail-less, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus’ mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber.|$|E
5|$|The Checkers, is a {{restaurant}} with rooms in Montgomery, Powys, Wales. Historically, the building {{was used as a}} coaching inn dating from the 17th century.
