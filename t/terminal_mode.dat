40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} speed {{regulation}} problem of permanent magnet synchronous motor servo {{system based on}} <b>terminal</b> sliding <b>mode</b> control method. By introducing a non-singular <b>terminal</b> sliding <b>mode</b> manifold, a novel <b>terminal</b> sliding <b>mode</b> controller is designed for the speed loop.
