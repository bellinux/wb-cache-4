5|$|Rights of {{the poor}} was another area that was {{expanded}} by the ACLU. In 1966 and again in 1968, activists within the ACLU encouraged the organization to adopt a policy overhauling the welfare system, and guaranteeing low-income families a baseline income; but the ACLU board did not approve the proposals. The ACLU {{played a key role}} in the 1968 King v. Smith decision, where the Supreme Court ruled <b>that</b> <b>welfare</b> benefits for children could not be denied by a state simply because the mother cohabited with a boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion {{that women are more}} likely to ask for maternity leave than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe <b>that</b> <b>welfare</b> states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers. There is also the notion that the net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on female employment.|$|E

25|$|Beveridge's {{arguments}} were widely accepted.

500|$|Nurmi {{felt that}} he got too much credit as an athlete and too little as a businessman, but his {{interest}} in running never died. He even returned to the track himself a few times. In 1946, he faced his old rival Edvin Wide in Stockholm in {{a benefit for the}} victims of the Greek Civil War. Nurmi ran for the last time on 18 February 1966 at the Madison Square Garden, invited by the New York Athletic Club. In 1962, Nurmi predicted <b>that</b> <b>welfare</b> countries would start to struggle in the distance events: [...] "The higher the standard of living in a country, the weaker the results often are in the events which call for work and trouble. I would like to warn this new generation: 'Do not let this comfortable life make you lazy. Do not let the new means of transport kill your instinct for physical exercise. Too many young people get used to driving in a car even for small distances.'" [...] In 1966, he took the microphone in front of 300 sports club guests and criticised the state of distance running in Finland, reproaching the sports executives as publicity seekers and tourists, and demanding athletes sacrifice everything to accomplish something. Nurmi lived to see the renaissance of Finnish running in the 1970s, led by athletes such as the 1972 Olympic gold medalists Lasse Virén and Pekka Vasala. He had complimented the running style of Virén, and advised Vasala to concentrate on Kipchoge Keino.|$|E

2500|$|Mac Donald {{identifies}} {{herself as}} a secular conservative. She has argued that conservative thinking is superior to liberalism {{by virtue of the}} ideas alone, and that religion should not affect the argument and is unnecessary for conservatism. She has criticized the notion of treating boys as a new victim group, and criticized universities for seeking to hire so-called diversity consultants to help boys succeed. She has criticized welfare and blamed philanthropic institutions such as the Ford Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation for suggesting <b>that</b> <b>welfare</b> is a right; in particular, she has criticized welfare as having a negative impact in the sense that [...] "generations have grown up fatherless and dependent". She has written <b>that</b> <b>welfare</b> programs serve as a [...] "dysfunction enabler" [...] and that food stamps cause an [...] "unhealthy dependence". She has criticized American immigration policy as [...] "importing another underclass", referring to Hispanics, which has the [...] "potential to expand indefinitely". She has argued that the reduction in crime seen in American cities since 1991 is a result of efficient policing, high incarceration rates, more police officers working, data-driven approaches such as CompStat in which police efforts target high-crime areas, and holding precinct commanders accountable for results. On the subject of terrorism prevention, Mac Donald has defended the Patriot Act and argued a case for secrecy and speed in handling problems as well as the sharing of information between departments within the intelligence community, and advocated that the benefits of government power be balanced against the risks of abuse. She has advocated for religious profiling by the police on the grounds that [...] "you cannot be an Islamic terrorist unless you're a member of the Muslim faith". She has said that the Abu Ghraib prison scandal's fallout was overblown and that opponents of then-President Bush used it to construct an exaggerated [...] "master narrative"; she said that Abu Ghraib was [...] "torture lite" [...] compared with more brutal atrocities such as those of Pol Pot. She defended using torture as an interrogation technique as being necessary in selected circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{finding no}} {{evidence}} of legal wrongdoing, McClellan continued to smear Barasch's management of his unions in the media. Yet, McClellan could not produce any reports of union members [...] "losing medical or dental care," [...] which he alleged would happen {{as a result of}} the reorganization of funds. The Herald Tribune reported that [...] "none of the members of either of his two unions seem to have lodged a protest." [...] One witness, W. Rutherford James, testified <b>that</b> <b>welfare</b> payments were consistently being made to his wholesale drug company Towns and James as expected. Ironically, McClellan's finding that the funds of the foundations [...] "could have been disposed of or distributed at the whim of the principals of these corporations" [...] and [...] "had they decided to divide [...] among themselves, they could have done so freely and with apparent legal impunity," [...] in the absence of Barasch or his associates ever doing so, provided support for Barasch's good intentions, consistent with his early union activities.|$|E
2500|$|The Netherlands is a {{founding}} member of the EU, Eurozone, G-10, NATO, OECD and WTO, as well as being a part of the Schengen Area and the trilateral Benelux Union. The country is host to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and five international courts: the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Court and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. The first four are situated in The Hague, as is the EU's criminal intelligence agency Europol and judicial co-operation agency Eurojust and the United Nations Detention Unit. This has led to the city being dubbed [...] "the world's legal capital." [...] The country also ranks second highest in the world's 2016 Press Freedom Index, as published by Reporters Without Borders. The Netherlands has a market-based mixed economy, ranking 17th of 177 countries according to the Index of Economic Freedom. It had the thirteenth-highest per capita income in the world in 2016 according to the International Monetary Fund. In 2017, the United Nations World Happiness Report ranked the Netherlands as the sixth-happiest country in the world, reflecting its high quality of life. The Netherlands also has a generous welfare state that provides universal health care, good public education and infrastructure, and a wide range of social benefits. <b>That</b> <b>welfare</b> system combined with its strongly redistributive taxing system makes the Netherlands one of the most egalitarian countries worldwide. It also ranks joint third highest in the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index, along with Australia.|$|E

From this setting, the following results are obtained: (1) an increase in agricultural productivity may hasten the onset of liberalization, (2) an improvement in labor efficiency {{in the public sector}} necessarily hastens the onset of the trade liberalization; and (3) the total <b>welfare</b> <b>that</b> adds the <b>welfare</b> during autarkic periods to that during specializing in manufacturing sector periods may be higher than that of the economy that exclusively specializes in the agricultural sector. ...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{the development of}} an animal welfare component of a quality assurance (QA) programme for the land transportation of livestock in Australia. Relationships among animal welfare practices on farms, during transport and at destinations require an approach that covers the entire production chain. The need for QA programmes includes increased awareness in the transport industry <b>that</b> animal <b>welfare</b> is an issue that engages the broader community and recognition <b>that</b> contentious <b>welfare</b> standards are discussed in the public domain and that public attitudes influence animal welfare standards. Three booklets have been produced <b>that</b> cover animal <b>welfare</b> issues in transport for the major commercial livestock species. Strategies for implementation of QA in industry have also been developed. The welfare standards have been incorporated into the transport industry's QA programme. QA programmes need to be acceptable to the community, be able to meet all customers' requirements and demonstrate to government authorities that they provide appropriate confidence <b>that</b> animal <b>welfare</b> standards have been met. The full impact of QA programmes will be fully appreciated when their ability to deliver comprehensive benefits and continual improvements in animal welfare has been evaluated...|$|R

60|$|As for Elizabeth, her {{thoughts}} were at Pemberley this evening {{more than the}} last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill {{which could not be}} overlooked. It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished <b>that</b> <b>welfare</b> to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.|$|E
