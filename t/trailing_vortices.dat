5000|$|Whenever {{the speed}} or {{angle of attack}} of an airfoil changes there is a {{corresponding}} amount of vorticity deposited in the wake behind the airfoil, joining the two <b>trailing</b> <b>vortices.</b> This vorticity is a continuum of mini-starting-vortexes. The wake behind an aircraft is a continuous sheet of weak vorticity, between the two <b>trailing</b> <b>vortices,</b> and this accounts for the changes in strength of the <b>trailing</b> <b>vortices</b> as the airspeed of the aircraft and angle of attack on the wing change during flight. (The strength of a vortex cannot change within the fluid except by the dissipative action of viscosity.

A number of previous theoretical studies concentrating on inviscid standing-wave analyses for <b>trailing</b> wing-tip <b>vortices</b> are reviewed and reinterpreted {{in terms of the}} Rossby number criterion. Consistent with previous studies, the physical basis for the onset of breakdown is identified as the ability of the flow to sustain such waves. Previous computational results are reviewed and re-evaluated in terms of the proposed breakdown criterion. As a result, the cause of breakdown occurring near the inflow computational boundary, common to several numerical studies, is identified.

A wing has a finite span, and the circulation at any {{section of the}} wing varies with the spanwise direction. This variation is compensated by the release of streamwise vortices (called <b>trailing</b> <b>vortices),</b> due to conservation of vorticity or Kelvin Theorem of Circulation Conservation. These streamwise vortices merge to two counter-rotating strong spirals, called wing tip vortices, separated by distance close to the wing span and may be visible if the sky is cloudy. Treating the <b>trailing</b> <b>vortices</b> {{as a series of}} semi-infinite straight line vortices leads to the well-known lifting line theory. By this theory, the wing has a lift force smaller than that predicted by a purely two-dimensional theory using the Kutta-Joukowski theorem. Most importantly, there is an induced drag.

40|$|Gliding flight {{performance}} and wake topology {{of a common}} swift (Apus apus L.) were examined in a wind tunnel at speeds between 7 and 11 m s(- 1). The tunnel was tilted to simulate descending flight at different sink speeds. The swift varied its wingspan, wing area and tail span over the speed range. Wingspan decreased linearly with speed, whereas tail span decreased in a nonlinear manner. For each airspeed, the minimum glide angle was found. The corresponding sink speeds showed a curvilinear relationship with airspeed, with a minimum sink speed at 8. 1 m s(- 1) and a speed of best glide at 9. 4 m s(- 1). Lift-to-drag ratio was calculated for each airspeed and tilt angle combinations and the maximum for each speed showed a curvilinear relationship with airspeed, with a maximum of 12. 5 at an airspeed of 9. 5 m s(- 1).

40|$|<b>Trailing</b> <b>vortices</b> {{generated}} by lifting surfaces such as helicopter rotor blades, ship propellers, fixed wings, and canard control surfaces {{are known to}} be the source of noise, vibration, cavitation, degradation of performance, and other hazardous problems. Controlling these vortices is, therefore, of practical interest. The formation and behavior of the <b>trailing</b> <b>vortices</b> are studied in the present research. In addition, wing-tip blowing concepts employing axial blowing and spanwise blowing are studied to determine their effectiveness in controlling these vortices and their effects on the performance of the wing. The 3 D, unsteady, thin-layer compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved using a time-accurate, implicit, finite difference scheme that employs LU-ADI factorization. The wing-tip blowing is simulated using the actuator plane concept, thereby, not requiring resolution of the jet slot geometry. Furthermore, the solution blanking feature of the chimera scheme is used to simplify the parametric study procedure for the wing-tip blowing. Computed results are shown to compare favorably with experimental measurements. It is found that axial wing-tip blowing, although delaying the rolling-up of the <b>trailing</b> <b>vortices</b> and the near-field behavior of the flowfield, does not dissipate the circulation strength of the trailing vortex farther downstream. Spanwise wing-tip blowing has the effect of displacing the <b>trailing</b> <b>vortices</b> outboard and upward.

40|$|This work {{studies the}} design of {{trailing}} edge controls for swashplateless helicopter primary control, and examines the impact of those controls {{on the performance of}} the rotor. The objective is to develop a comprehensive aeroelastic analysis for swashplateless rotors in steady level flight. The two key issues to be solved for this swashplateless control concept are actuation of the trailing edge controls and evaluating the performance of the swashplateless rotor compared to conventionally controlled helicopters. Solving the first requires simultaneous minimization of trailing flap control angles and hinge moments to reduce actuation power. The second issue requires not only the accurate assessment of swashplateless rotor power, but also similar or improved performance compared to conventional rotors. The analysis consists of two major parts, the structural model and the aerodynamic model. The inertial contributions of the trailing edge flap and tab are derived and added to the system equations in the structural model. Two different aerodynamic models are used in the analysis, a quasi-steady thin airfoil theory that includes arbitrary hinge positions for the flap and the tab, and an unsteady lifting line model with airfoil table lookup based on wind tunnel test data and computational fluid dynamics simulation. The predicted swashplateless rotor power is sensitive to the pattern of trailed vorticity from the rotor blade. <b>Trailed</b> <b>vortices</b> are added at the inboard and outboard boundaries of the trailing edge flap, and the flap deflection is used to calculate an effective angle of attack for the calculation of the near and far wake. This wake model predicts the swashplateless rotor requires less main rotor power than the conventional UH- 60 A helicopter from hover to &mu = 0. 25. As the forward flight speed increases, the swashplateless predicted power increases above the conventional rotor, and the rotor lift-to-drag ratio decreases below that of the conventional rotor...|$|R

40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that the power {{consumption}} of an unbaffled stirred vessel decreases significantly when the regular blades are replaced by fractal ones. In this paper, the physical explanation for this reduction is investigated using Direct Numerical Simulations at Re= 1600. The gaps around the fractal blade perimeter create jets that penetrate inside the recirculation zone in the wake and break up the <b>trailing</b> <b>vortices</b> into smaller ones. This affects the time-average recirculation pattern on the suction side. The volume of the separation region is 7 % smaller in the wake of the fractal blades. The lower torque of the fractal impeller is equivalent to a decreased transport of angular momentum; this difference stems from the reduced turbulent transport induced by the smaller <b>trailing</b> <b>vortices.</b> The major difference in the turbulent dissipation is seen in the vicinity of <b>trailing</b> <b>vortices,</b> due to fluctuations of velocity gradients at relatively low frequencies.
