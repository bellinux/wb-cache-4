Consequently, some believe in <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were prehistoric humans in Sri Lanka from 500,000 BP or earlier, and consider it likely that {{they were on the}} island by 300,000 BP.

Stokes's law said simply that the frequency of fluorescent light cannot be greater than {{the frequency of the}} light (usually ultraviolet) inducing it. Einstein eliminated the ultraviolet catastrophe by imagining a gas of photons behaving like a gas of electrons that he had previously considered. He was advised by a colleague to be careful how he wrote up this paper, in order to not challenge Planck, a powerful figure in physics, too directly, and indeed the warning was justified, as Planck never forgave him for writing it.|$|E

25|$|The AMY1 gene {{copy number}} {{has been found}} to be {{correlated}} to different levels of starch in diets of different populations. 8 Populations from different continents were categorized into high starch diets and low starch diets and their AMY1 gene copy number was visualized using high resolution FISH and qPCR. It was found that the high starch diet populations which consists of the Japanese, Hadza, and European American populations had a significantly higher (2 times higher) average AMY1 copy number than the low starch diet populations including Biaka, Mbuti, Datog, Yakut populations. It was hypothesized that the levels of starch in one’s regular diet, the substrate for AMY1, can directly affect the copy number of the AMY1 gene. Since it was concluded that the copy number of AMY1 is directly correlated with salivary amylase, the more starch present in the population’s daily diet, the more evolutionarily favorable it is to have multiple copies of the AMY1 gene. The AMY1 gene was the first gene to provide strong evidence for evolution on a molecular genetics level. Moreover, using comparative genomic hybridization, copy number variations of the entire genomes of the Japanese population was compared to that of the Yakut population. It was found that the copy number variation of the AMY1 gene was significantly different from the copy number variation in other genes or regions of the genome, suggesting that the AMY1 gene was under a strong selective pressure that had little or no influence on the other copy number variations. Finally, the variability of length of 783 microsatellites between the two populations were compared to copy number variability of the AMY1 gene. It was found that the AMY1 gene copy number range was larger than that of over 97% of the microsatellites examined. This implies that natural selection played a considerable role in shaping the average number of AMY1 genes in these two populations. However, as only 6 populations were studied, it is important to consider <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> may be other factors in their diet or culture that influenced the AMY1 copy number other than starch.|$|E

40|$|Behavioral {{experiments}} in humans {{with a rare}} genetic mutation that compromises the function of alpha-transducin (Galpha the alpha-subunit of the G-protein in the primary cone phototransduction cascade) reveal a residual cone response only viable at high light levels and at low temporal frequencies. It has three characteristic properties. First, it limits temporal frequency sensitivity to {{the equivalent of a}} simple first order reaction with a time constant of approximately 140 ms. Second, it delays the visual response by an amount that is also consistent with such a reaction. Third, it causes temporal acuity to be linearly related to the logarithm of the amount of bleached pigment. We suggest that these properties are consistent with the residual function depending on a sluggishly generated cone photobleaching product, which we tentatively identify as a cone metarhodopsin. By activating the transduction cascade, this bleaching product mimics the effects of real light and is therefore one of the molecular origins of "background equivalence," the long-established observation that the aftereffects of photopigment bleaches and the effects of real background lights are equivalent. Alternative explanations for the residual cone response include <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a secondary phototransduction mechanism that bypasses alpha-transduction, or that the truncated alpha-transduction that results from the mutation retains some minimal functionality...|$|R
500|$|In 1975, the Columbia album The Basement Tapes was compiled, {{mainly by}} Robertson and {{engineer}} Rob Fraboni.

The Basement Tapes included sixteen Dylan songs recorded at Big Pink in 1967, as well as eight Band demos from various times and locations between 1967 and 1975.

In his liner notes for The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3, John Bauldie commented on these second and third stages in which groups of Big Pink songs had come to light: [...] "Despite the... emergence [...] in collectors' circles of a further couple of hours of Basement Tapes, it seems as though there's a good deal left unheard.
