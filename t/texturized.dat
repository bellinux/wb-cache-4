25|$|Proteins are {{composed}} of amino acids. Vegans obtain all their protein from plants, omnivores usually a third, and ovo-lacto vegetarians half. Sources of plant protein include legumes such as soy beans (consumed as tofu, tempeh, <b>texturized</b> vegetable protein, soy milk and edamame), peas, peanuts, black beans and chickpeas (the latter often eaten as hummus); grains such as quinoa (pronounced keenwa), brown rice, corn, barley, bulgur and wheat (the latter eaten as bread and seitan); and nuts and seeds. Combinations that contain high amounts of all the essential amino acids include rice and beans, corn and beans, and hummus and whole-wheat pita.|$|E
25|$|Dishes {{based on}} {{soybeans}} are {{a staple of}} vegan diets because soybeans are a complete protein; this means they contain all the essential amino acids for humans and can be relied upon entirely for protein intake. They are consumed most often {{in the form of}} soy milk and tofu (bean curd), which is soy milk mixed with a coagulant. Tofu comes in a variety of textures, depending on water content, from firm, medium firm, and extra firm for stews and stir-fries; to soft or silken for salad dressings, desserts, and shakes. Soy is also eaten in the form of tempeh and <b>texturized</b> vegetable protein (TVP); also known as textured soy protein (TSP), the latter is often used in pasta sauces.|$|E

25|$|Adams, Chichoni and Molina gave {{detailed}} briefings for the animators {{for each}} environment and {{character in the}} game. Modeling and animation for the 30 environments and 10 characters was done on Softimage 3D, version 3.5. Most environments were done separately. However, {{the center of the}} ship in particular also included other environments as it connects the first and second class canals, the top of the well and the central well; Darren Blencowe was responsible for modeling the ship's center. A total of six 3D artists worked on the game. Rendering was done on Mental Ray; in order to complete the rendering in time, the team's systems administrator wrote a Perl-based software to control all rendering jobs for up to 20 processors working 24 hours a day. In order to animate the parrot, Philip Dubree, one of the team's animators, visited pet shops and studied macaws for inspiration. Dubree created a skeleton and modeled the wings and feathers, later adjoining the body. He also scanned photos of macaw features and used Photoshop to incorporate those in the parrot's textures. In order to create Titania's statue at the Top of the Well, animator John Attard build the 3D model as a refractive metallic structure and <b>texturized</b> it with streaks of oxidation on her face; Attard used the Statue of Liberty as a visual reference.|$|E

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} silicon wafer surface <b>texturizing</b> were studied. A low cost {{cleaning}} method that utilizes recycled Freon in an ultrasonic vapor degreaser to remove organic and inorganic contaminants {{from the surface}} of silicon wafers as received from silicon suppliers was investigated. The use of clean dry air and high throughout wafer batch drying techniques was shown to lower the cost of wafer drying. A two stage <b>texturizing</b> process was examined for suitability in large scale production. Also, an in-depth gettering study with the two stage <b>texturizing</b> process was performed for the enhancement of solar cell efficiency, minimization of current versus voltage curve dispersion, and improvement in process reproducibility.

40|$|Building {{recognition}} from images and video streams of mobile devices to <b>texturize</b> and refine an existing 3 D city model {{is an open}} challenge, since such models most often do not completely represent the actual buildings. We present ways to extract buildings from images enabling improvement of the existing model. The approach is based on edge detection on images to detect walls, pure use of sensor data by creating an overlay to the video stream with the 3 D model renderer from current position by a server, {{and the use of}} structure from motion algorithms to create point clouds and recognize a building via the support of the device's sensors. We show that we are thus able to <b>texturize</b> and refine an existing 3 D city model...|$|R

40|$|Streptococcus macedonicus is a Gram {{positive}} {{lactic acid}} bacterium {{that is part of}} the starter flora present in Greek sheep and goat cheeses. The S. macedonicus Sc 136 strain produces a high-molecular-mass, highly <b>texturizing</b> exopolysaccharide composed of d-glucose, d-galactose, and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine in the molar ratio of 3 : 2 : 1. The structure of the exopolysaccharide produced by S. macedonicus Sc 136 was determined by chemical analysis, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The repeating unit was shown to be: The polysaccharide sidechain β-d-Galf-(1 → 6) -β-d-Glcp-(1 → 6) -β-d-GlcpNAc is a key factor in the highly <b>texturizing</b> properties of the S. macedonicus Sc 136 exopolysaccharide.
