25|$|Contemporary Dutch {{politics}} is more polarized <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> recent years, {{especially on the}} issues for which Fortuyn was best known. People debate {{the success of their}} multicultural society, and whether they need to better assimilate newcomers. The government's decision to expel numerous asylum seekers whose applications had failed was controversial. Fortuyn had advocated an amnesty for asylum seekers already residing in the Netherlands.|$|E

Only about a dozen industrial customers between Sunbury and Rouses Point remain. The railroad's current prognosis is arguably better <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> a long time. Along with the New York connection, haulage agreements with other railroads greatly increased traffic. CP steadily uses their high power AC traction locomotives on road trains that operate instead of aging SD40-2 models.|$|E

25|$|The vagina {{has been}} studied in humans more <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> other animals. Its {{location}} and structure varies among species, and may vary in size within the same species. Female mammals usually have {{the opening of the}} urethra of the urinary system separate to the vaginal opening of the genital tract. This is different to male mammals, who usually have a single opening, the external urethral opening for both urination and reproduction. The vaginal opening is much larger than the nearby urethral opening, and both are protected by the labia in humans. In amphibians, birds, reptiles and monotremes, the cloaca is the single external opening for the gastrointestinal tract and the urinary and reproductive tracts.|$|E
25|$|The D {{has been}} a {{difficult}} money-making venture for some time. Originally constructed as a coal hauling route and when that business declined it proved difficult to turn a profit. It operates {{in some of the}} most rural areas of New York State, and very few industrial customers between Binghamton and Rouses Point remain. The railroad's current prognosis is arguably better <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> a long time. Along with the NYC connection, haulage agreements with other railroads are greatly increasing traffic. CP has been steadily using their high power AC traction locomotives on their road trains that run on the line, instead of their aging SD40-2 models. This is an indication of the increasing importance of reliable service. There are also major signal and track projects underway to modernize the former D lines.|$|E

Fringes second season ended {{with an average of}} 6.252million viewers per episode and a 2.3 ratings share for adults 18–49, causing the series to finish in 79th place out of all the season's network television shows. However, Fringe and its lead-in, Bones, did help the network increase 52% among adults aged 18–49 and 65 percent among total viewers from the same night the previous year. Despite its middling ratings, Fringe received a full-season renewal on March6,2010.|$|E

2500|$|..... I {{do think}} the Internet’s under much greater attack <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the past.

But they’ve also seen a tremendous user reaction, like the backlash against SOPA. I think that governments fight users’ freedoms at their own peril.|$|E
2500|$|The {{political}} climate between Ireland and Britain is {{better and more}} peaceful today <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> a very long time, but if a rugby or soccer game is held between the two countries, {{there is a certain}} amount of tension or jingoism.
