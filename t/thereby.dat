5|$|Being a {{transcription}} factor, {{a protein}} that binds to specific DNA sites and <b>thereby</b> regulates {{the activity of}} specific genes, Tbr1 is localized in the nucleus where the cell’s DNA is located. Tbr1 is expressed in glutamergic neurons rather than GABAergic neurons.|$|E
5|$|By chewing the tap {{and lateral}} roots of trees, {{caterpillars}} {{feed on the}} cambium growth, produced by the tree {{at the site of}} the injury. The larvae may girdle a root, <b>thereby</b> causing its death, or the lesions may be only partial, allowing the root to continue functioning, albeit with some deformity.|$|E
5|$|CENIPA {{concluded}} that the ExcelAire pilots {{also contributed to the}} accident with, among others, their failure to recognize that their transponder was inadvertently switched off, <b>thereby</b> disabling the collision avoidance system on both aircraft, as well as their overall insufficient training and preparation.|$|E

5|$|Depictions are {{necessarily}} conjectural, because petrification and other fossilization mechanisms do not preserve colors. Any reconstitution is <b>thereby</b> an artist's view that, {{in order to}} stay within the limits of the best knowledge at the time, must necessarily be inspired by other pictures already scientifically proved.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium iodide and {{dysprosium}} bromide {{are used}} in high-intensity metal-halide lamps. These compounds dissociate near the hot center of the lamp, releasing isolated dysprosium atoms. The latter re-emit light in the green and red part of the spectrum, <b>thereby</b> effectively producing bright light.|$|E
5|$|Eurostar's current {{target is}} to reduce {{emissions}} by 35 percent per passenger journey by 2012, putting itself beyond the efforts of other railway companies in this field and <b>thereby</b> winning the 2007 Network Rail Efficiency Award.|$|E
5|$|Favaloro and {{his brother}} {{endeavored}} to improve the general level of health {{in what was then}} a remote region.

5|$|From Russia with Love was a {{critical}} and commercial success. It took more than $78 million in worldwide box office receipts, far more than its $2 million budget and more than its predecessor Dr. No, <b>thereby</b> becoming a blockbuster in 1960s cinema.|$|E
5|$|Galileo Galilei was {{the first}} {{astronomer}} to view the Pleiades through a telescope. He <b>thereby</b> discovered that the cluster contains many stars too dim {{to be seen with}} the naked eye.

5|$|In 1921, the Metre Convention was {{extended}} to include all physical units, including the ampere and others defined by the Fourth International Conference of Electricians in Chicago in 1893, <b>thereby</b> enabling the CGPM to address inconsistencies {{in the way that}} the metric system had been used.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{researchers}} announced {{findings that}} sublethal exposure to imidacloprid rendered honey bees significantly {{more susceptible to}} infection by the fungus Nosema, <b>thereby</b> suggesting a potential link to CCD, given that Nosema is increasingly considered to contribute to CCD.|$|E
5|$|In February 1930 he {{enrolled}} at Woodward School for Boys in Washington, D.C. {{as a means}} of earning credits for admission to George Washington University, <b>thereby</b> avoiding the university's entrance examination, and successfully graduated in June.

5|$|In {{addition}} to promoting growth of kelp forests, sea otters {{can also have}} a profound effect in rocky areas that tend to be dominated by mussel beds.

5|$|In captivity studies, it {{has been}} {{discovered}} {{that most of the}} hybrids do not follow Haldane's Rule, but sometimes hybrid females die before they reach sexual maturity, <b>thereby</b> supporting the case for the American black duck being a distinct species.|$|E
5|$|In generic sense, {{vaccination}} {{works by}} priming {{the immune system}} with an 'immunogen'. Stimulating immune response, via use of an infectious agent, is known as immunization. The development of immunity to polio efficiently blocks person-to-person transmission of wild poliovirus, <b>thereby</b> protecting both individual vaccine recipients and the wider community.|$|E
5|$|In the finale, a giant papier-mâché puppet of Colbert ("Fearzilla") {{was brought}} on stage to symbolize his superiority.
