5|$|Cycling is an {{increasingly}} popular {{way to get}} around London. The launch of a cycle hire scheme in July 2010 has been successful and generally well received. The London Cycling Campaign lobbies for better provision. But in the central parts (The City & City of Westminster) are common cyclists a rare <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Only messenger with helmets and sport bikes are seen there. There is a general lack of bike roads. Further out from the city centre is however lots of bikes parked around tube stations and other.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Brian Zoromski rated [...] "The Merger" [...] 9 out of 10, an {{indication}} of an [...] "amazing" [...] episode. He called the opening sequence [...] "arguably the funniest" [...] scene, and believed [...] "Andy's proven to be an even better source of hilarity than he ever was in the Stamford office." [...] Zoromski was unhappy however with the [...] "outright product placement [...] " [...] with Staples, writing that [...] "the show's quality felt a little compromised. It's one <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> blatant product placement in a reality show like Survivor or American Idol but when it invades a great scripted comedy… well, it kinda drags the show down to the reality level." [...] Doug Elfman of the Chicago Sun-Times thought the episode was [...] "funnier than it's been in a while," [...] praising Kelly but criticizing the [...] "fat-guy joke." [...] Elfman cited Michael and Andy's new relationship as a positive element. Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A+.|$|E
500|$|It’s a rerelease of {{a nine-year-old}} game that quietly smuggled microtransactions into its online mode, and I can’t believe a concept so ludicrous {{is a real}} thing. That’s {{something}} a parody of the industry would come up with. It’s one <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the sad normalization of fee-to-pay elements within brand new releases, but to witness them shoveled retroactively into an old beloved title from an age before such trash gained traction? Activision has set the bar for “AAA” avarice – a new height for greed and a new low for the games business overall. [...] Most remasters are sold as complete, definitive editions of the original games, packing in all the downloadable content and expansions that may have followed the initial launch. COD4 is {{paving the way for}} publishers to triple down – not just make money by selling an old game with updated visuals, but by tacking on DLC and microtransactions too. Should this pay off, I’ve little doubt that other publishers will attempt it themselves. [...] The rampant, unchecked greed on display is almost impressive in its audacity. To sneak freemium bullshit into a nine-year-old game that leveraged its own fandom to sell a completely different game is a masterstroke of sliminess, a monument to Bobby Kotick’s notorious lack of shame.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{an intense}} rivalry between Victoria and Western Australia. Western Australia's rivalry {{likewise}} {{stemmed from the}} feeling in Western Australia that Victoria never gave their state the credit it deserved, despite {{some of the best}} players of all time coming from the state. Some games widely regarded as some {{of the best in the}} history of Australian football were played between Victoria and Western Australia in the 1980s. Shane Parker a former Western Australia player, said of the rivalry [...] "When I was a kid, the State of Origin games were the greatest ever.

[...] In May 1863 the regiment was united with the Baltimore Light Artillery and Company A of the 1st Maryland Cavalry (CSA), as Colonel Johnson, under orders by the Secretary of War, began to organize the various Maryland units under one command, with a view to forming {{for the first time a}} true Maryland Line in the Confederate Army.|$|E

2500|$|Gladstone {{went beyond}} image by {{appealing}} {{directly to the}} people. In his Midlothian campaign – so called because he stood {{as a candidate for}} that county – Gladstone spoke in fields, halls and railway stations to hundreds, sometimes thousands, of students, farmers, labourers and middle class workers. Although not the first leader to speak directly to voters – both he and Disraeli had spoken directly to party loyalists before on special occasions – {{he was the first to}} canvass an entire constituency, delivering his message to anyone who would listen, encouraging his supporters and trying to convert his opponents. Publicised nationwide, Gladstone's message became that of the party. Noting its significance, Lord Shaftesbury said, [...] "It is a new thing and a very serious <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Prime Minister on the stump." ...|$|E

[...] His run on the kickoff through the whole Illinois team proved that, for an end, he {{is all over the}} field and has a nose for fumbles, is strong and tricky. [...] There {{is no such thing as}} boxing this bird. Kirk, and his tackling of receivers of punts is a beautiful <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> [...] So the ends are the strongest spot on the team. [...] These two birds can play on my team any time, any place, anywhere, and at any price." ...|$|E
