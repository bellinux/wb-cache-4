5|$|The <b>tulip</b> {{breaking}} virus {{played a}} role in the <b>tulip</b> mania of the Dutch Golden Age. The famous Semper Augustus <b>tulip,</b> in particular, owed its striking pattern to infection with the plant disease, a kind of mosaic virus, making it the most expensive of all the <b>tulip</b> bulbs sold.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the <b>tulip</b> to Europe is usually attributed to Ogier de Busbecq, the ambassador of FerdinandI, Holy Roman Emperor to the Sultan of Turkey, who sent the first <b>tulip</b> bulbs and seeds to Vienna in 1554 from the Ottoman Empire. <b>Tulip</b> bulbs were soon distributed from Vienna to Augsburg, Antwerp and Amsterdam. Its popularity and cultivation in the United Provinces (now the Netherlands) is generally thought to have started in earnest around 1593 after the Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius had taken up a post at the University of Leiden and established the hortus academicus. He planted his collection of <b>tulip</b> bulbs and found {{they were able to}} tolerate the harsher conditions of the Low Countries; shortly thereafter the <b>tulip</b> began to grow in popularity.|$|E
5|$|According to Mackay, lesser <b>tulip</b> manias also {{occurred}} {{in other parts}} of Europe, although matters never reached the state they had in the Netherlands. He also claimed that the aftermath of the <b>tulip</b> price deflation led to a widespread economic chill throughout the Netherlands for many years afterwards.|$|E

5|$|By 1636 the <b>tulip</b> bulb {{became the}} fourth leading export {{product of the}} Netherlands, after gin, {{herrings}} and cheese.

5|$|Nearly {{a century}} later, during {{the crash of}} the Mississippi Company and the South Sea Company in about 1720, <b>tulip</b> mania {{appeared}} in satires of these manias. When Johann Beckmann first described <b>tulip</b> mania in the 1780s, he compared it to the failing lotteries of the time. In Goldgar's view, even many modern popular works about financial markets, such as Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street (1973) and John Kenneth Galbraith's A Short History of Financial Euphoria (1990; written soon after the crash of 1987), used the <b>tulip</b> mania as a lesson in morality. <b>Tulip</b> mania again became a popular reference during the dot-com bubble of 1995–2001.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{since then}} the <b>tulip</b> has become indelibly {{associated}} with the Netherlands and all things Dutch. {{it was during this}} period that the tulipiere, a ceramic vase for growing tulips indoors was devised, and the Golden Age of Dutch Painting was replete with images of tulips. Although <b>tulip</b> festivals are held around the world in the spring, the most famous of these is the display at Keukenhof. One of the better-known novels on tulips is The Black <b>Tulip</b> by Alexandre Dumas, père in 1850, dealing with a contest to grow a black <b>tulip</b> in late seventeenth-century Haarlem.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, formal futures markets {{appeared}} in the Dutch Republic during the 17th century. Among the most notable centered on the <b>tulip</b> market, {{at the height of}} Tulipmania. At the peak of <b>tulip</b> mania, in February 1637, some single <b>tulip</b> bulbs sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsworker. Research is difficult because of the limited economic data from the 1630s—much of which come from biased and very speculative sources. Some modern economists have proposed rational explanations, rather than a speculative mania, for the rise and fall in prices. For example, other flowers, such as the hyacinth, also had high initial prices {{at the time of their}} introduction, which immediately fell. The high asset prices may also have been driven by expectations of a parliamentary decree that contracts could be voided for a small cost—thus lowering the risk to buyers.|$|E

Some economists also point to other factors associated with speculative bubbles, such as a growth in the supply of money, demonstrated {{by an increase in}} deposits at the Bank of Amsterdam during that period.|$|E

5|$|The modern {{discussion}} of <b>tulip</b> mania {{began with the}} book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, published in 1841 by the Scottish journalist Charles Mackay; he proposed that crowds of people often behave irrationally, and <b>tulip</b> mania was, along with the South Sea Bubble and the Mississippi Company scheme, one of his primary examples. His account was largely sourced from a 1797 work by Johann Beckmann titled A History of Inventions, Discoveries, and Origins. In fact, Beckmann's account, and thus Mackay's by derivation, was primarily sourced to three anonymous pamphlets published in 1637 with an anti-speculative agenda. Mackay's vivid book was popular among generations of economists and stock market participants. His popular but flawed description of <b>tulip</b> mania as a speculative bubble remains prominent, even though since the 1980s economists have debunked many aspects of his account.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tulip</b> was {{different}} from every other flower known to Europe at that time, with a saturated intense petal color that no other plant had. The appearance of the nonpareil <b>tulip</b> as a status symbol at this time coincides {{with the rise of}} newly independent Holland's trade fortunes. No longer the Spanish Netherlands, its economic resources could now be channeled into commerce and the country embarked on its Golden Age. Amsterdam merchants were {{at the center of the}} lucrative East Indies trade, where one voyage could yield profits of 400%.|$|E
5|$|Washington Park is {{the site}} of many festivals, concerts, and special occasions. The <b>Tulip</b> Festival held every year since 1949 in Washington Park is {{highlighted}} by the blossoming of 200,000 tulips throughout the park. The African-American tradition of Pinksterfest, whose origins are traced back even further to Dutch festivities, was later incorporated into the <b>Tulip</b> Fest and since 1998 the <b>Tulip</b> Fest has also included the Mother of the Year award. The Latin Festival and the Columbus Day Parade and Italian Festival are some of the ethnic festivals held every year in the park. The city, the Albany Police Athletic League, and Hannaford supermarkets sponsor the Capital Holiday Lights every winter, with 125 displays through the park. Proceeds benefit juvenile crime prevention programs.|$|E

5|$|Original Tulipa {{species can}} be {{obtained}} for ornamental purposes, such as Tulipa tarda and Tulipa turkestanica. These {{are referred to as}} species, or botanical, tulips, and tend to be smaller plants but better at naturalising than the cultivated forms. Breeding programs have produced a wide range of <b>tulip</b> types, enabling blooming through a much longer season by creating early, mid- and late spring varieties. Fourteen distinct types are available in addition to botanical tulips, including Lily-flowered, Fringed, Viridiflora and Rembrandt. In addition to blooming season, <b>tulip</b> varieties differ in shape, and height, and exhibit a wide range of colours, both pure and in combination.|$|E

5|$|The {{plant life}} around the Griffin Reservoir on Leggetts Creek {{includes}} various native trees and understory plants. From the reservoir downstream to an intake pond near Interstate 81, the creek's riparian buffer contains old growth forest, including <b>tulip</b> poplar trees. In addition to <b>tulip</b> popular, hemlock and pine also {{occur in the}} Griffin Mills reach of the creek. Near Leggetts Gap, the creek has some riparian buffering. Even in its lower reaches, the it has a stable vegetative cover in some areas. However, other areas are full of invasive plants. Major invasive plant species include Japanese knotweed, Norway Maple, and Ailanthus. Overall, the riparian buffer of the creek mainly consists of grassland and forested land.|$|E
