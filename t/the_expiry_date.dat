25|$|The {{time value}} of an option is {{the total value of}} the option, less the {{intrinsic}} value. It partly arises from the uncertainty of future price movements of the underlying. A component of the time value also arises from the unwinding of the discount rate between now and <b>the</b> <b>expiry</b> <b>date.</b> In the case of a European option, the option cannot be exercised before <b>the</b> <b>expiry</b> <b>date,</b> so it is possible for the time value to be negative; for an American option if the time value is ever negative, you exercise it (ignoring special circumstances such as the security going ex dividend): this yields a boundary condition.|$|E

Judges of four courts raised doubts about the alleged Göbel anticipation, {{but there was never}} a decision in a final hearing due to <b>the</b> <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> of Edison's patent.

40|$|This paper unveils the {{diversity}} in lock-in agreements of firms {{listed on the}} Nouveau Marche stock exchange in France. We give the main economic reasons why shareholders adopt lock-in agreements that are more stringent than legally required. We relate the abnormal returns and the abnormal volume at <b>the</b> <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> of <b>the</b> different types of lock-in contracts {{to the degree of}} underpricing, venture-capitalist reputation and underwriter reputation. Abnormal returns and trading volume increase at the lock-in expiry; this is especially pronounced at <b>the</b> <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> of insider lock-in contracts as insiders are legally required to be locked-in. We do not find significant abnormal returns at <b>the</b> <b>expiries</b> of VC contracts, even though trading volume increases at their lock-in expiry. There is also no evidence of a positive (negative) relation between abnormal returns (abnormal volume) and more stringent lock-in contracts. Lock-in contracts and the degree of underpricing are complementary signalling devices. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{owner of}} an option may on-sell the option to a third party in a {{secondary}} market, in either an over-the-counter transaction or on an options exchange, depending on the option. The market price of an American-style option normally closely follows that of the underlying stock, being {{the difference between the}} market price of the stock and the strike price of the option. The actual market price of the option may vary depending on a number of factors, such as a significant option holder may need to sell the option as <b>the</b> <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> is approaching and does not have the financial resources to exercise the option, or a buyer in the market is trying to amass a large option holding. The ownership of an option does not generally entitle the holder to any rights associated with the underlying asset, such as voting rights or any income from the underlying asset, such as a dividend.|$|E
25|$|Expiry (or Expiration in the U.S.) is {{the time}} and the day that a {{particular}} delivery month of a futures contract stops trading, as well as the final settlement price for that contract. For many equity index and Interest rate future contracts (as well as for most equity options), this happens on the third Friday of certain trading months. On this day the t+1 futures contract becomes the t futures contract. For example, for most CME and CBOT contracts, at the expiration of the December contract, the March futures become the nearest contract. This is an exciting time for arbitrage desks, which try to make quick profits during the short period (perhaps 30 minutes) during which the underlying cash price and the futures price sometimes struggle to converge. At this moment the futures and the underlying assets are extremely liquid and any disparity between an index and an underlying asset is quickly traded by arbitrageurs. At this moment also, the increase in volume is caused by traders rolling over positions to the next contract or, in the case of equity index futures, purchasing underlying components of those indexes to hedge against current index positions. On <b>the</b> <b>expiry</b> <b>date,</b> a European equity arbitrage trading desk in London or Frankfurt will see positions expire in as many as eight major markets almost every half an hour.|$|E
500|$|The term {{representative}} democracy {{does not appear}} in the Constitution of Singapore. However, an analogy may be drawn from the approach taken by the High Court of Australia to the Australian Constitution. In Lange v. Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1997), the Court inferred that the Constitution embodies a system of representative and responsible government from various provisions, including those requiring periodic elections to choose the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Similarly, the Singapore Constitution prescribes that Parliament may be dissolved by the Prime Minister under certain conditions, and will be automatically dissolved by operation of law five years from its first sitting. A general election must be held within three months after each dissolution of Parliament. The Constitution also states that [...] "he President shall be elected by the citizens of Singapore in accordance with any law made by the Legislature", and requires a poll for the election to be held not more than three months before the incumbent's term of office expires, or, if the office is vacated before <b>the</b> <b>expiry</b> <b>date,</b> within six months of the date when it becomes vacant. In addition, in the Proclamation of Singapore contained in the Independence of Singapore Agreement, which was entered into by the Governments of Malaysia and Singapore to effect Singapore's separation from Malaysia, the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew proclaimed on behalf of the people and the Government that as from 9 August 1965 [...] "Singapore shall be forever a sovereign democratic and independent nation...".|$|E

50|$|With {{outbound}} marketing, marketers {{are often}} {{expected to find}} different ways {{to cope with the}} rejections from potential customers. Also, advertisements have <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> and once <b>the</b> <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> have been reached, the campaign will have to be started again. Thus, the return on investment of advertisement campaigns is rather low most of the time. Outbound marketing is often considered to be a poorly targeted technique as it cannot be personalised to specific customers. Moreover, advertisements often interrupt customers and as such, they may be wrongly considered by potential consumers.|$|R
