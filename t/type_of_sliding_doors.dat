50|$|A {{vertical}} <b>door</b> is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> that <b>slides</b> vertically, {{usually on}} a rail or track.|$|R
50|$|A <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> door {{which opens}} {{horizontally}} by sliding, usually parallel to a wall. <b>Sliding</b> <b>doors</b> can be mounted either {{on top of}} a track below or be suspended from a track above and some types 'disappear' in a wall when slid open. There are several <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> such as pocket doors, Arcadia doors, and bypass <b>doors.</b> <b>Sliding</b> <b>doors</b> are commonly used as shower doors, glass doors, screen doors, wardrobe doors or in vans.|$|R
50|$|A <b>sliding</b> glass <b>door</b> or patio <b>door,</b> is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> in {{architecture}} and construction, {{is a large}} glass window opening in a structure that provide door access from a room to the outdoors, fresh air, and copious natural light. A <b>sliding</b> glass <b>door</b> is usually considered a single unit consisting of two panel sections, one being fixed and one a being mobile to slide open. Another design, a wall sized glass pocket door has one or more panels movable and sliding into wall pockets, completely disappearing for a 'wide open' indoor-outdoor room experience.|$|R
50|$|Opens {{normally}} like {{a traditional}} van <b>sliding</b> <b>door,</b> but unlike most <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> where the track ison {{the exterior of}} the vehicle, this type has it inside and {{on the side of the}} door itself. This allows the exterior to remain clean in design and yet the <b>door</b> can <b>slide</b> past the trailing edge of the car. However, this design is very unusual and can only be found on the Mitsubishi RVR (Space Runner, not ASX). Invented by Mitsubishi Motors, it was designed because the RVR is a short car compared to the size of the siding door, making it incapable of having a track on {{the exterior of the}} car. Thus, the inner-track mechanism was used so the <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> can <b>slide</b> open wide enough to let passengers enter and exit the car easily. The new Mitsubishi EK Wagon/Nissan Otti also uses this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>door,</b> but has it only on one side while the driver's side door of the back seats is a normal hinge <b>door.</b> The <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the EK wagon is also electric-powered.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> door {{is mounted}} on or {{suspended}} from a track for the <b>door</b> to <b>slide,</b> usually horizontally. It is a feature predominately relegated to minibuses and buses to provide a large entrance or exit for passengers without obstructing the adjacent pathway between the vehicle and any adjoining object or the side(s) of passenger and commercial vans so as to allow a larger unobstructed access to the interior for loading and unloading.Sliding doors are often used in mini MPVs such as the Toyota Porte and Peugeot 1007 and Renault Kangoo, but are more commonly used in full-sized MPVs like the Toyota Previa, the Citroën C8, the Peugeot 807, the Chrysler Voyager and the Kia Sedona. Their use has increased {{over the years as}} MPVs have increased in popularity, because it gives easy access and makes parking in tight spaces possible. [...] The most common <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>door,</b> that has a three-point suspension and opens outwards, then runs {{along the side of the}} vehicle, was introduced in 1964 by Volkswagen AG as an option on its Type 2 vans.|$|R

50|$|The eight-car trains have {{stainless}} steel bodies, and the exterior livery features orange highlights. Each car has three pairs <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> per side, unlike the four pairs per side on 103 and 201 series trains.|$|R

50|$|Both {{trains are}} six-car {{electric}} multiple units, {{which can be}} expanded to eight cars in the future. End cars and the fourth car are trailers, the second, third and fifth car are powered. The trains have a design speed of 120 km/h, but are operated at a maximum 110 km/h on surface tracks and a maximum 100 km/h in tunnels. Each car has a length of 19.95 m and a width of 3.12 m, with a carbody made of aluminum. The commuter version has four pairs <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> {{on each side of}} each car, the express version has two pairs <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> on each side of each car.|$|R
50|$|Advantages <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> {{are that}} {{there is almost no}} room {{required}} to open the door, they are relatively easy to automate. The mechanism is also secure, since it cannot be lifted out <b>of</b> its hinges. <b>Sliding</b> <b>doors</b> are commonly found as store-, hotel- and office entrances, elevators, patios doors, closet doors and room dividers. Transport industries have also used tipically in vans, trains and metro. Volkswagen used slidding doors in Volkswagen Fridolin produced between 1964 and 1974.|$|R

50|$|Some users criticised {{the use of}} hinged <b>doors,</b> {{feeling that}} <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> would be <b>of</b> more use for quick exits or in {{confined}} places, but others were {{quick to point out}} the drawbacks <b>of</b> this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> door. With a plain panel sided van <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> are OK, but the 400E was designed to have access to the body via a side door in addition to the double rear doors. It was also produced as a chassis/cab for pickup or other style of special bodywork, so precluding the use <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>doors,</b> and anyone who has had experience of them knows they are a mixed blessing when one comes to repair them.|$|R
