5|$|Quantum of Solace was {{the last}} in Ford Motor's three-film deal that began with 2002's Die Another Day. Although Ford sold over 90% of the Aston Martin company in 2007, the Aston Martin DBS V12 {{returned}} for the film's car chase around Lake Garda; Dan Bradley was hired as second unit director because of {{his work on the}} second and third Bourne films, so the film would continue <b>the</b> <b>gritty</b> action style begun in Casino Royale. He had intended to use Ford GTs for the opening chase, but it was replaced by the Alfa Romeo 159. After location filming in Italy, further close-ups of Craig, the cars and the truck were shot at Pinewood against a blue screen. Originally three Alfa Romeos were in the sequence: but Forster felt the scene was running too long and re-edited the scene so it only looked like two Romeos were chasing Bond. Six Aston Martins were destroyed during filming, {{and one of them was}} purchased by a fan.|$|E

25|$|Montparnasse {{became famous}} in the 1920s, {{referred}} to as les Années Folles (the Crazy Years), and the 1930s as the heart of intellectual and artistic life in Paris. From 1910 {{to the start of}} World War II, Paris' artistic circles migrated to Montparnasse as alternative to the Montmartre district which had been the intellectual breeding ground for the previous generation of artists. The Paris of Zola, Manet, France, Degas, Fauré, a group that had assembled more on the basis of status affinity than actual artistic tastes, indulging in the refinements of Dandyism, was {{at the opposite end of}} the economic, social, and political spectrum from <b>the</b> <b>gritty,</b> tough-talking, die-hard, emigrant artists that peopled Montparnasse.|$|E
25|$|Eager to {{work with}} Peckinpah again, Steve McQueen {{presented}} him Walter Hill's screenplay to The Getaway. Based on the Jim Thompson novel, <b>the</b> <b>gritty</b> crime thriller detailed lovers on the run following a dangerous robbery. Both Peckinpah and McQueen needed a hit, and they immediately began working on the film in February 1972. Peckinpah had no pretensions about making The Getaway, as his only goal {{was to create a}} highly polished thriller to boost his market value. McQueen played Doc McCoy, a convicted robber who colludes with corrupt businessman Jack Beynon (Ben Johnson) to be released from prison and later masterminds a bank heist organized by Beynon. A series of double-crosses ensues and Doc and his wife Carol (MacGraw) attempt to flee from their pursuers to Mexico. Replete with explosions, car chases and intense shootouts, the film became Peckinpah's biggest financial success to date earning more than $25 million at the box office. Though strictly a commercial product, Peckinpah's creative touches abound throughout, most notably during the intricately edited opening sequence when McQueen's character is suffering from the pressures of prison life. The film remains popular and was remade in 1994. starring Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.|$|E

25|$|Many railfans have a {{fixation}} with steam locomotives, which sometimes also fascinate the general public, {{as seen by}} the attendance at stations to view steam-hauled railtours. Sometimes the appeal of trains is nostalgic, recalling an earlier era when the railroads {{played a central role}} in commerce and transportation, and the depot was the center of every town. Nostalgia may also result from the long, lonesome wail of the train's horn, which mimics vocalizations that want for a more simple time reminiscent of home, as heard in country or folk music worldwide. Sometimes the appeal is due to a fondness for large machinery that can be inspected and photographed up close. Sometimes there is an appeal of the scenery of the railroad running through open, uninviting terrain, or <b>the</b> <b>gritty</b> ambiance of the urban train yard. In this case, urban exploration poses a similar appeal. Some people were raised near streetcar tracks or railways. Everyday activities were associated with railroad, which seemed to be a part of life. This may lead to an interest in railcars, how they move, numbering, and other rail systems in the world and how they compare with their native ones. If these people move to another locale, their interest in railroads might be nostalgic.|$|E

500|$|Group leader RZA {{produced}} Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) {{by creating}} sonic collages from classic soul samples and clips from martial arts movies such as Shaolin and Wu Tang (1981). He complemented the rappers' performances with [...] "lean, menacing beats that evoked their gritty, urban surroundings {{more effectively than}} their words," [...] according to Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic. The use of soul samples and various esoteric clips, and the technique by which RZA employed them in his beats was unique and largely unprecedented in hip-hop. <b>The</b> <b>gritty</b> sound of Enter the Wu-Tang is due, at least in part, {{to the use of}} cheap equipment to produce the album.|$|E

Stephen Hunter said that Berg {{had not understood that}} the shifting tone and plot twists were meant to be humorous, and that he had played straight {{what was supposed to be}} a dark comedy and subversive satire. David Denby said Berg's style—especially his use of close-ups—was intended to showcase [...] "genuine actors at work", while Manohla Dargis of The New York Times insisted Berg had taken Hancock to heart and brought gravity to the film.|$|E
500|$|For Rise Against, Appeal to Reason {{marked a}} musical shift from <b>the</b> <b>gritty</b> punk rock that had {{previously}} defined their career, to a more accessible and radio-friendly sound, with greater emphasis on production value. The New York Times felt the album was more tune-oriented than the band's previous works, while John Hanson of Sputnikmusic said that the album is [...] "'appealing' to a larger audience than old fans will be comfortable with". According to Bill Stewart of PopMatters, [...] "Appeal to Reason is a Rise Against album. If you possess {{more than a passing}} familiarity with the band, I wouldn't even bother scrolling through the rest of this review, and I'd certainly avoid checking out the rating at the end of it—because that first sentence, for better or worse, says everything that needs to be said about this album." [...] Critics have characterized the album's music as melodic hardcore and punk rock, with influences of pop punk.|$|E
500|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Deus Ex, {{composed}} by Alexander Brandon (primary contributor, including main theme), Dan Gardopée ("Naval Base" [...] and [...] "Vandenberg"), Michiel van den Bos ("UNATCO", [...] "Lebedev's Airfield", [...] "Airfield Action", [...] "DuClare Chateau" [...] plus minor contribution {{to some of}} Brandon's tracks), and Reeves Gabrels ("NYC Bar"), was praised by critics for complementing <b>the</b> <b>gritty</b> atmosphere predominant throughout the game with melodious and ambient music incorporated {{from a number of}} genres, including techno, jazz, and classical. The music sports a basic dynamic element, similar to the iMUSE system used in early 1990s LucasArts games; during play, the music will change to a different iteration of the currently playing song based on the player's actions, such as when the player starts a conversation, engages in combat, or transitions to the next level. All the music in the game is tracked - Gabrels' contribution, [...] "NYC Bar", was converted to a module by Brandon.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to Bale breaking {{his hand and}} Worthington hurting his back, special effects technician Mike Menardis almost lost his leg filming an explosion. The sequence required a manhole cover being blown into the air, which hit Menardis and partially severed his leg. McG noted it was a testament to <b>the</b> <b>gritty</b> style of the film. [...] "I say with respect, I didn't want that Star Wars experience of everything's a blue screen, tennis balls, and go for it. I had Stan Winston build all the machines. We built all the sets, the explosive power, the explosive power so you feel that wind and that percussion and that heat blowing your eyebrows off. And with that, you get a couple bumps and bruises on the way, but you get it in an integrity and a realism that hopefully echoes Apocalypse Now. You couldn't say, 'Let's just shoot Apocalypse Now in Burbank, I think it's going to feel just as good.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the book was positive, particularly regarding the depth the book added to the Halo universe. Reviewer Eric Qualls commented that [...] " [...] interesting to read {{and give you a}} much greater understanding" [...] to the universe. Qualls made a positive comparison to Robert A. Heinlein's Starship Troopers regarding the manner of story telling. GameCritics' Brad Gallaway also praised the back-story the book adds {{and the quality of the}} story. Fellow reviewer Gene Park noted the descriptions in the book went beyond what was presented in the game calling them [...] "vibrant and rousing." [...] He also complimented the characters presented in the novel saying they all [...] "fit nicely into the Halo universe" [...] but some times there were too many characters to remember. Sal Accardo of 3D Action Planet said of the book; [...] " [...] isn’t going to win any Pulitzers anytime soon. It’s well written, and a solid page-turner, but it’s still basically an action movie presented in book form" [...] but praised <b>the</b> <b>gritty</b> presentation of the Spartans. Don D'Ammasa of the Science Fiction Chronicle called the book [...] "competently written", but stated the plot was [...] "simpleminded".|$|E
500|$|Henry Goldblatt, {{writing for}} Entertainment Weekly, gave the episode a grade B. He accused {{the show of}} abandoning the [...] "racial {{diversity}} and <b>the</b> <b>gritty</b> poverty" [...] of the film, but still allowed that Peter Berg had [...] "kept the thrust". The Matt Saracen character was singled out as particularly promising. While positively contrasting the show with other teen-age dramas like One Tree Hill, Goldblatt also had doubts about its staying power. Varietys Brian Lowry called the show [...] "Earnest, beautifully shot and perhaps more organically religious {{than anything else in}} primetime". Still, he felt the show was [...] "like one of those family programs middle America and conservatives pine for that too few of them actually bother to watch". He pointed out that the show had to compete with both House and Dancing With the Stars, among women as well as men, in order to survive. The Washington Post critic Tom Shales called the show [...] "Extraordinary in just about every conceivable way," [...] particularly emphasising the quality of the cast. Shales did have issues with the documentary style of show's camera movements, but still thought it could be the [...] "best new drama series of the season".|$|E

He also questions that the track [...] "Little Superstar" [...] was not chosen for the UK's Eurovision song over [...] "Believe in Me".

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} {{towards the}} episode were mixed. Rob Vaux of Mania.com graded it a C+; Vaux {{said that the}} [...] "we've seen [...] scenario too many times before." [...] Vaux noted the [...] "plenty of House of the Dead-style kung fu", but felt Tapping did not [...] "have that Bruce Lee vibe." [...] Dunne's portrayal received a mixed response, stating [...] "the script doesn't give him much to do besides bark out exposition and snarl with hatred at the faceless enemy," [...] though he and Tapping did [...] "succeed in evoking an entire end-of-the-world scenario {{with just a few}} terse lines of dialogue." [...] In review of the first and second season releases on Blu-ray Disc, Michael Simpson of CinemaSpy named the episode [...] "Sanctuary's take on I Am Legend", but thought the plot was [...] "derivative". However, from a visual effects stand point, Simpson called the episode a [...] "highlight of the second season", adding [...] "the post-apocalyptic world created by the effects team at Anthem is worthy of a motion picture and together with <b>the</b> <b>gritty</b> production design looks disturbingly real". In review of the second season, David Blackwell of Enterline Media named [...] "Pavor Nocturnus" [...] as a standout episode, along with [...] "Veritas" [...] and [...] "Haunted".|$|E

Garry Mulholland of Uncut dubbed it a [...] "masterpiece", while Rolling Stone magazine's Jody Rosen hailed the xx as [...] "masters of restraint". In his review for the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot {{felt that the}} album [...] "functions as a near-perfect mood piece" [...] and, [...] "because {{there are so few}} elements in each song," [...] each sound [...] "makes a bigger impact." [...] In The Daily Telegraph, Neil McCormick praised Smith for [...] "somehow widening and deepening the sound without intruding", while Puja Patel of Spin magazine credited him for [...] "both stretching and magnifying <b>the</b> <b>gritty</b> beauty of his vocalists". Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau complimented their preoccupation with [...] "young love" [...] and stated, [...] "these scrupulously abstract verses capture its obsessive doubts and fragile exaltations with delicacy and tenderness." [...] Michael Alan Goldberg of The Village Voice called the album [...] "gorgeous" [...] and said that the music is like a [...] "haiku instead of sonnet; Hemingway rather than Fitzgerald, with meaning and emotion lurking beneath the surface." [...] Simon Price found the group's take on the duet concept highly engaging and emotional while deeming Coexist a greater work than their debut album.|$|E
