She stated: [...] "I guess it was when I watched Monster... I pretty much knew. I {{had to find a}} way. I had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> something completely transformational." [...] In 2005, Pinto began a modeling career and joined Elite Model Management India, with whom she worked {{for two and a half}} years. She was featured in several television and print advertisements for products such as Wrigley's Chewing Gum, Škoda, Vodafone India, Airtel, Visa, eBay, and De Beers.|$|E
500|$|Burton {{insisted that}} the film be bloody, as he felt stage {{versions}} of the play which {{cut back on the}} bloodshed robbed it of its power. For him, [...] "Everything is so internal with Sweeney that [...] is like his emotional release. It's more about catharsis than it is a literal thing." [...] Producer Richard D. Zanuck said that [...] " [...] had a very clear plan that he wanted to lift that up into a surreal, almost Kill Bill kind of stylization. We had done tests and experiments with the neck slashing, with the blood popping out. I remember saying to Tim, 'My God, do we dare do this?'" [...] On set, the fake blood was colored orange to render correctly on the desaturated color film used, and crew members wore bin liners to avoid getting stained while filming. This macabre tone made some studios nervous, and it was not until Warner Bros., DreamWorks and Paramount had signed up for the project that the film's $50 million budget was covered. Burton said [...] "the studio was cool about it and they accepted it because they knew what the show was. Any movie is a risk, but it is nice to be able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> that doesn't fit into the musical or slasher movie categories." ...|$|E

[...] Matt Burns of The Post wrote, [...] "Take the polarizing summer single 'SexyBack', a repetitive song with little structure that doesn't know when to stop, all centered on a ridiculous declaration. Somehow, it works." [...] The Diamondbacks Michael Greenwald reported that [...] "SexyBack" [...] was [...] "lyrically, musically and vocally the weakest song" [...] on the album. A writer of The State Journal-Register was not impressed with the song and concluded, with SexyBack' is the most annoyingly dumb song to hit Billboards No. 1 since 'Hollaback Girl'". Guy Blackman of The Sunday Age wrote: [...] "The distorted vocals and stilted production of first single 'Sexyback' make Timberlake's claim to be 'bringing sexy back'... seem almost laughable." [...] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "Justin Timberlake, we didn't even know that sexy was missing until 2006. We're just happy Justin brought it back safe and sound." [...] Charlie Brooker, columnist for The Guardian, jokingly criticised Timberlake, saying [...] "How DARE this dot-eyed, crop-haired, fun-sized, guff-tongued, pirouetting waif-boy scamper on to the world's airwaves and loudly proclaim to be the sole global administrator of all things sexy? You'd think it takes massive balls <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> but given the shrill, squeaking vocals cheeping through his ghastly little gobhole, it's safe to assume he's got testes the size of capers. He's practically a human dog whistle, the shrieking, high-pitched, mosquito-lunged ponce." ...|$|E

[...] "That a mother would want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> to her child just because she wanted to go out and party," [...] he said. [...] "We felt that the motive that the state provided was, in our eyes, was just kind of weak." [...] Although the foreman objected to Casey Anthony's behavior in the wake of her daughter's death, he and the jury did not factor that behavior into their verdict because it was not illegal. They initially took a vote on the murder count, which was 10–2 (two voting guilty), but after more than ten hours of deliberation, they decided the only charges they felt were proven were the four counts of lying to law enforcement.|$|E

To be exploring the next chapter for Kat as well as working alongside my best mate, Shane, is a dream come true and a huge compliment." [...] Richie said, [...] "Both Jessie and I are absolutely thrilled to be given this amazing opportunity. To have a whole drama focused around Kat and Alfie is a huge honour for us both and we just can't wait to start filming." [...] Treadwell-Collins later spoke again about the new series: [...] "We want to create something big around [...] EastEnders as a brand can afford to do it and I've always wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I'm from Ireland originally, so it's a place I know well. Shane's Irish, Jessie’s half Irish—so, there’s an Irish connection between all of us. The other important thing about the spin-off show is it's not just about Kat and Alfie—we've created a whole new world and a new lot of characters. The writers have created a really lovely, interesting world, but also with our style of storytelling." [...] EastEnders previously had a storyline set in Ireland in 1997, which was heavily criticised for its unflattering depiction of Irish life, but Richie stated the series would not parody Irish life or [...] "play the dopey card".|$|E
2500|$|On February 16, 2009, Travis {{attacked}} Sandra Herold's 55-year-old friend Charla Nash, inflicting devastating {{injuries to}} her face and limbs.

[...] Travis was familiar with Nash, who had also worked at the Herolds' towing company, although Nash had a different hair style {{at the time of the}} attack. [...] The chimp had been taking medication for Lyme disease. Herold, then 70 years old, attempted to stop Travis by hitting him with a shovel and stabbing him with a butcher knife. [...] "For me <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> – put a knife in him – was like putting one in myself," [...] Herold later said. The chimp turned around, she said, as if to say, [...] "'Mom, what did you do?'" [...] The ape was angered more. Herold then called 9-1-1 and pleaded for help. Travis' screams can be heard in the background of the tape as Sandra pleads for police, who initially believed the call to be a hoax, until she started screaming, [...] "He's eating her!" [...] Emergency medical services waited for police before approaching the house. Travis walked up to the police car when it arrived, tried to open a locked passenger door, and smashed a side-view mirror. Then he went calmly around to the driver's-side door and opened it, at which point Officer Frank Chiafari shot him several times. Travis retreated to the house, where he was found dead next to his cage.|$|E
