5|$|In a status-conscious society {{like that}} of the Romans, {{clothing}} and personal adornment gave immediate visual clues about <b>the</b> <b>etiquette</b> of interacting with the wearer. Wearing the correct clothing was supposed to reflect a society in good order. The toga was the distinctive national garment of the Roman male citizen, but it was heavy and impractical, worn mainly for conducting political business and religious rites, and for going to court. The clothing Romans wore ordinarily was dark or colourful, and the most common male attire seen daily throughout the provinces would have been tunics, cloaks, and in some regions trousers. The study of how Romans dressed in daily life is complicated by a lack of direct evidence, since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value, and surviving textiles from the period are rare.|$|E

Moreover, his son Fergus works on the farm. Fergus' character is stumbling. Although valiant, he frequently transgresses <b>the</b> <b>etiquette</b> that the Francophone aristocratic society took for granted.|$|E

As <b>the</b> <b>etiquette</b> of courtly love became more complicated, the knight might wear the colors of his lady: where blue or black were sometimes the colors of faithfulness, green could be a sign of unfaithfulness. Salvation, previously found in the hands of the priesthood, now came from the hands of one's lady. In some cases, there were also women troubadours who expressed the same sentiment for men.|$|E
25|$|Ibn Jamāʻah, in his abridgement, divided {{these terms}} into four {{different}} categories according to subject (and adding six {{terms in the}} process). The first pertains to the matn (text) of the hadith and its three divisions and 30 types. The three divisions are ṣaḥīḥ, ḥasan, and ḍa`īf. The thirty types include those mentioned in hadith terminology and others. The second deals with the isnād (chain of narration) and comprises 11 types. These types generally fall within the discipline of biographical evaluation. The third category includes six types: the qualifications necessary for conveying hadith, the manners {{in which they are}} transmitted, the transcription of hadith, and <b>the</b> <b>etiquette</b> of the narrator and of the student. The fourth category, which comprises 21 types, relates to the names of the narrators. This includes the definition of a ṣaḥābī (companion), a tābi`ī (follower), the time periods of narrators, names and paidonymics among others.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the colony}} of the Dutch East Indies, fashion played an {{important}} role to define ones' status and social class. The European colonials wore European fashion straight out of the Netherlands, or even Paris, while the natives wore their traditional clothings that are distinct in every regions. As the years progressed and the Dutch influence became stronger, many natives began mixing European styles within their traditional clothing. High-ranking natives within the colony as well as nobility, would wear European style suits with their batik sarongs for special occasions and even for everyday use. More and more native Indonesians began to dress more European. This of course came with the idea that those who wore European clothing were more progressive and open towards a European society and <b>the</b> <b>etiquette</b> that came with it. More and more the European influence was gaining precedence within native Indonesians. This probably {{stems from the fact that}} many natives were treated better if they wore European clothing. Their European counterparts acknowledged them, and that in turn was most likely a catalyst for adoption western clothing into traditional Indonesian clothing.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{after the}} coronation, Louisa Ulrika {{prepared}} a new coup {{in favor of}} absolute monarchy. Queen Louisa Ulrika strongly dominated her husband and the court, and she would likely had been the real ruler during her spouse's reign had Sweden been an absolute monarchy: at this point, however, the king was a mere decoration. This greatly displeased the queen, herself born in an absolute monarchy. She could not understand nor condone the Swedish parliament, the Riksdag. For her, it was not acceptable for a royal person to have to receive peasants in the royal salons, as {{she was forced to}} do with the peasant's representatives from the Riksdag. She was further enraged when the Riksdag forced the king to give up his claims on the throne of Holstein-Gottorp. To display her contempt, she humiliated the representatives of the Riksdag by using <b>the</b> <b>etiquette</b> of the royal court: she stopped their carriages at the Palace gates, forced them to wait for hours while she let those who arrived before them be received, and let them sit on smaller chairs to humiliate them. In the court theatres, the French theatre troupe and the Italian opera company performed plays encouraging hinting that the king to take control of his kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Mace (gada) is {{the weapon}} of God Hanuman in Ramayana. Lord Vishnu also carries a gada named Kaumodaki {{in one of}} his four hands. In the Mahabharata epic, the fighters Bhima, Duryodhana, Jarasandha and Balarama were said to be masters of the gada. In the mace combat, Bhima wins the final battle against Duryodhana by hitting his inner thigh. Such an attack below the waist was said to be against <b>the</b> <b>etiquette</b> of mace duels, {{implying}} a degree of commonality to this type of fighting. It was and still is used as training equipment by wrestlers. The traditional gada (mace) was essentially a wooden or steel sphere mounted on a handle and with a single spike at the top. An alternative mace-head was the lotus-shaped padam. According to the Agni Purana, the gada can be handled in twenty different ways. Due to its weight, the gada is said to be best suited to fighters with a large build or great strength. The Mughal club or mace, known as a gurj or gargaj, had a head consisting of 8-10 petal-shaped blades. Fitted with basket-hilt, a spherical pommel, and a spiked top, this type of club was designed for beating down armour-clad opponents. Alternatively, some gurj had a spiked top and a hand-guard.|$|E

500|$|The {{journey to}} Philadelphia was Mason's first beyond Virginia and Maryland. According to Josephine T.

Broadwater suggested that Mason went to Philadelphia because he knew the federal congress needed additional power, and because he felt that body could act as a check on the powers of state legislatures. As the Virginians waited for the other delegates to arrive, they met each day and formulated what became known as the Virginia Plan. They also did some sightseeing, and were presented to Pennsylvania's president, Benjamin Franklin. Within a week of arrival, Mason was bored with the social events to which the delegates were invited, [...] "I begin to grow tired of <b>the</b> <b>etiquette</b> and nonsense so fashionable in this city".|$|E

Jones spent two years in Britain from 1928, attending the Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover, and graduating top of his class at the RAF's Central Flying School. He later recalled of this posting, [...] "The social life was new to me, as was <b>the</b> <b>etiquette...</b> I learned as fast as I could, but I have no doubt that I unwittingly committed many a social blunder." [...] As the RAAF's senior officer in the UK, Jones had expected to be invited to accompany the airship R101 on its maiden flight to India.
