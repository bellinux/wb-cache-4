50|$|DuoCISH is a {{variation}} of CISH that addresses the need for two different probes on the same slide. It is a well-established technique for HER-2/neu amplification detection {{even though it is}} sometimes reported to be less effective than FISH. In this technique, one probe binds the reference which, in the case of HER-2/neu amplification detection, is CEN17 (the centromere of chromosome 17) while the other probe binds the target sequence which is HER-2/neu. DuoCISH combines both FISH and CISH in that it converts signals from FISH probes to chromogenic substrates. It works on the principle that blue cyanine dye is a substrate for HRP and red dye is a substrate for AP. For example, green fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) signals are converted <b>to</b> blue chromogenic <b>precipitates</b> <b>through</b> an anti-FITC antibody conjugated to HRP, and Texas Red signals are converted <b>to</b> red chromogenic <b>precipitates</b> <b>through</b> an anti-Texas Red antibody conjugated to AP. An advantage of DuoCISH is {{that it is possible to}} distinguish between chromosomal aneuploidy and gene amplification as the reference gene will also be amplified in aneuploidy but not in gene amplification detection.|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of this study it cannot be ruled out that the {{appraisal}} of the noise affects the association between air and road traffic noise exposure and children's health and cognition. However, the conclusion is limited due to the relatively small group of annoyed children, which may have influenced our group comparisons. Furthermore, the observed relation between annoyance and perceived health is possibly biased {{due to the fact that}} both were measured within the same questionnaire. These are the main conclusions of a cross-sectional multi-center study carried out among 2, 844 schoolchildren (age 9 - 11 years) attending 89 primary schools around three European airports. The aim was to investigate how annoyance affects the relation between air and road traffic noise exposure and children's health and cognition. Different, sometimes competing, working mechanisms of how noise affects children's health are suggested. Some effects are supposed <b>to</b> be <b>precipitated</b> <b>through</b> (chronic) stress, while others may arise directly. There is still no theory that can adequately account for the circumstances in which noise will affect cognitive performance. © 2010 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} is the first attempt to systematically quantify the dislocation-precipitate interaction in terms of applied shear stress, precipitate resistance, and the required time to reach the critical state of dislocation-precipitate interaction when a dislocation line is about <b>to</b> pass <b>through</b> <b>precipitates.</b> <b>To</b> model the dislocation-precipitate interaction, we adopt a modified three-dimensional dislocation dynamics. Using the present modeling approach, which employs three-dimensional dislocation dynamics simulations, we obtain thousands of data points, accounting for various precipitate resistances, applied shear stresses, and precipitate spacing. The material of reference is Copper (Cu). From the simulations, which quantify the dislocation-precipitate interaction {{in terms of the}} applied shear stress, precipitate resistance scale, and dislocation-precipitate interaction time, we found a universal equation. The dislocation-precipitate interaction time versus precipitate resistance and stress, referred to as the "dislocation-precipitate interaction map," determines the "pass" or "no-pass" state of the interaction. Using this map, we incorporate the dislocation-precipitate interaction time in a two-dimensional multiscale framework which adopts the dislocation dynamics approach at the micro-scale and the finite element method at the macro-scale. We use this framework to model the mechanical behavior of free-standing copper thin films. The results show a dual effect of the dislocation-precipitate interaction time on the hardening level...|$|R
