5000|$|Alcorn {{had trained}} a {{colleague}} at the South Dakota school, Inis B. Hall, on the <b>Tadoma</b> method. Hall {{took over the}} education of Tad Chapman when Alcorn left for Detroit to research the use of vibration techniques in teaching language and speech to sighted deaf children. When Chapman was accepted in 1931 to attend the Perkins School for the Blind in Massachusetts, Hall accompanied him and introduced Alcorn's <b>Tadoma</b> system to the teachers there. [...] Until the mid-1950s <b>Tadoma</b> was the preferred method of teaching oral speech to children who were deafblind.|$|E
5000|$|When the Simpson {{family left}} Kentucky, Alcorn moved {{with them to}} answer the plea of {{the father of a}} deafblind boy, Winthrop (Tad) Chapman. She began {{teaching}} at the South Dakota School for the Deaf and worked with Tad for four years, perfecting her system of what she called the <b>Tadoma</b> Tactile-Sense Method. She pioneered a system of visual symbols, first using pipe cleaners to easily create the shapes. She named her method <b>Tadoma</b> after these two children: Tad and Oma. (See more on Tad Chapman at his niece's blog.) ...|$|E
50|$|When she retired, Alcorn {{returned}} to Stanford where {{she became a}} member of the Stanford Woman's Club and served as the first woman elder in the Stanford Presbyterian Church. The critical need for trained teachers drew Alcorn to begin work with the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB). Founded in 1921, this foundation was greatly supported and publicized throughout the 1920s by Keller and Sullivan. The <b>Tadoma</b> method required extensive training and highly skilled educators. In order to accommodate a greater diversity of teachers, the schools began supplementing the <b>Tadoma</b> method with the manual alphabet and sign language.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, {{especially}} if the speaker knows sign language, the deaf-blind person may use the <b>Tadoma</b> method with one hand, feeling the speaker's face; {{and at the same}} time, the deaf-blind person may use their other hand to feel the speaker sign the same words. In this way, the two methods reinforce each other, giving the deaf-blind person a better chance of understanding what the speaker is trying to communicate. In addition, the <b>Tadoma</b> method can provide the deaf-blind person with a closer connection with speech than they might otherwise have had. This can, in turn, help them to retain speech skills that they developed before going deaf, and in special cases, to learn how to speak brand new words.|$|E
50|$|Sophia Kindrick Alcorn (August 3, 1883 - November 28, 1967) was an {{educator}} {{best known for}} inventing the <b>Tadoma</b> method of communication {{with people who are}} deaf and blind. She was a strong advocate for the rights of people with disabilities and upon retiring from her long career in teaching, she worked with the American Foundation for the Blind.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Tadoma</b> {{method was}} invented by American teacher Sophie Alcorn and {{developed}} at the Perkins School for the Blind in Massachusetts. It is named after the first two children to whom it was taught: Winthrop [...] "Tad" [...] Chapman and Oma Simpson. It was hoped that the students would learn to speak by trying to reproduce what they felt on the speaker's face and throat while touching their own face.|$|E
5000|$|Alcorn {{moved to}} Morganton, North Carolina to teach {{for one year}} at the North Carolina School for the Deaf (1908-09), then {{returned}} to Kentucky, teaching at the Kentucky School for the Deaf in Danville, Kentucky. [...] The Kentucky School for the Deaf is the oldest state-supported school of its type in the U.S. {{and was the first}} school for the deaf west of the Alleghenies. Alcorn taught there from 1909 to 1920, and it was here that she first developed the <b>Tadoma</b> method.|$|E
50|$|The paralinguistic {{properties}} of speech {{play an important}} role in human communication. There are no utterances or speech signals that lack paralinguistic properties, since speech requires the presence of a voice that can be modulated. This voice must have some properties, and all the {{properties of}} a voice as such are paralinguistic. However, the distinction linguistic vs. paralinguistic applies not only to speech but to writing and sign language as well, and it is not bound to any sensory modality. Even vocal language has some paralinguistic as well as linguistic properties that can be seen (lip reading, McGurk effect), and even felt, e.g. by the <b>Tadoma</b> method.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tadoma</b> is {{a method}} of {{communication}} used by deafblind individuals, in which the deafblind person places their thumb on the speaker's lips and their fingers along the jawline. The middle three fingers often fall along the speaker's cheeks with the little finger picking up the vibrations of the speaker's throat. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} 'tactile lipreading', as the deafblind person feels the movement of the lips, as well as vibrations of the vocal cords, puffing of the cheeks and the warm air produced by nasal sounds such as 'N' and 'M'. There are variations in the hand positioning, and it {{is a method}} sometimes used by people to support their remaining hearing.|$|E
40|$|Quite a {{few years}} ago when I was working as a special {{education}} teacher I taught <b>Tadoma,</b> a form of tactile speech reading. The system is largely neglected today but I have always felt that somewhere along the line I should share my experiences, particularly considering there are now so few people around the world with expert knowledge in this area. In this paper I provide a description of Tadoma: what it is, who developed it, and when, where, and why it was taught. I go on to provide details regarding how I taught it, its strengths and weaknesses, and conclude with a discussion regarding whether there might be a place for <b>Tadoma</b> in 2014...|$|E
40|$|Strong {{support of}} the {{capacity}} of touch as a communicative sense {{is provided by the}} <b>Tadoma</b> method of communication. Through this method, individuals who are deaf-blind have been able to acquire a full range of spoken language abilities. In the <b>Tadoma</b> method, direct contact is made between the hand of the deaf-blind receiver and the face of a talker to monitor the various articulatory actions that occur during speech. Studies conducted with a group of experienced deaf-blind practitioners of <b>Tadoma</b> have documented their abilities for speech reception, speech production, and linguistic competence. The results of this research indicate that individuals who suffered deaf-blindness in early childhood (e. g., around 18 months of age) can understand speech produced at slow-to-normal rates with reasonable accuracy, can produce speech that is reasonably intelligible to many listeners, and have an extensive command of English that compares favorably in many areas to that of hearing individuals. The performance of these deaf-blind individuals implies the adequacy of the tactual sense to support the development of speech and language and thereby provides a strong impetus for continued research on the development of sensory-substitution devices for spoken language processing. Current efforts on the development and evaluation of artificial tactile devices for speech communication will be discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|Motivated by {{the highly}} {{successful}} <b>Tadoma</b> method of speech communication, a multi-finger positional display (the TACTUATOR) {{was developed to}} study perception via the kinesthetic and vibrotactile aspects of the tactual sensory system of the hand. The information transmission capabilities with the TACTUATOR were assessed {{through a series of}} absolute identification experiments. An information transfer (IT) of 5. 6 to 6. 5 bits for stimulus durations of 125 to 500 msec was obtained in absolute-identification experiments with sets of signals derived by varying frequency, amplitude, and site of stimulation of multicomponent waveforms. An estimated IT rate of 12 bits/sec was obtained by sequencing three random stimuli and (a) having the subject identify only the middle stimulus and (b) extrapolating this IT to that for continuous streams. This IT rate is roughly the same as that achieved by <b>Tadoma</b> users in tactual speech communication. 1. INTRODUCTION This work was motivated by our interest in [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{of a paper}} {{presented}} at the 10 th International Congress on AcousticsPast attempts at using the skin for recognition of tactile patterns derived from acoustic speech signals have largely been unsuccessful for perception of running speech. Problems facing researchers in this field include: frequency discrimination, especially for electrical stimulation, temporal and spatial resolution, real time speech processing and tactile pattern configuration strategies. It is considered that recent developments in speech processing which allow real time estimation of formant frequencies and vocal tract area functions will enable a successful speech aid to be developed. Based on results of the <b>Tadoma</b> (or Hofgaard) Method, in which speech is perceived by the deaf-blind using tactile and kinesthetic senses to determine movements of a speaker's articulators, a model is evaluated which enables a tactile display of articulatry information derived from parameters extracted from the speech signal by real time speech processing. Psychophysical measurements of percepts of computer derived patterns were carried out concentrating in particular on patterns more likely to be important for phonemic and speech discrimination. In this way it is hoped to validate the model as a useful speech aid for the profoundly and partially deaf. 1980 Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|A human 2 ̆ 7 s {{ability to}} {{transmit}} speech through touch {{has been demonstrated}} by a natural communication method, the <b>Tadoma</b> method, in which a deaf-and-blind individual places the hands on the speaker 2 ̆ 7 s face, and integrates movements, vibrations and air flows from the articulation process for speech perception. In contrast, the achievable information transmission rates with tactile hearing aids have been limited, {{largely due to the}} homogeneous nature of the stimulation pattern. It is the goal of this research to broaden the range of tactual stimuli to achieve more effective tactual speech communication. A multi-finger tactual display was developed that is capable of stimulating both the kinesthetic and the cutaneous components of the somatosensory system. A novel two-degree-of-freedom (2 -dof) controller consisting of a feedback controller and a prefilter was developed to preserve the relative spectral intensities present in a speech signal in terms of the perceived intensities once the signal has been delivered to a human hand. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the masking effects of presenting multiple tactual signals simultaneously to the hand, frequency and amplitude discrimination thresholds were estimated for six target frequencies at two amplitude levels in the absence and presence of masking stimuli. An important finding is that the low-frequency large-amplitude motions and high-frequency small-amplitude vibrations do not interfere significantly. They are later used for redundant coding of speech information. The speech-to-touch coding scheme extracts acoustic features from the speech and presents them as multidimensional tactual waveforms, stimulating both kinesthetic and cutaneous sensory systems. Evaluation of our speech communication system is conducted by measuring performance in both phoneme discrimination and identification tasks. Normal-hearing participants can effectively distinguish between two consonants that differ in voicing (94...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{way of dealing with}} blindness and deafness has been some forni of sensory substitution- allowing a remaining sense to take over the functions lost {{as the result of the}} sensory impairment. With visual loss, hearing and touch naturally take over as much as they can, vision and touch do the same for hearing, and in the rare cases where both vision and hearing are absent (e. g., Keller 1908), touch provides the primary contact with the external world. However, because unaided sensory substitution is only partially effective, humans have long improvised with artifices to facilitate the substitution of one sense with another. For blind people, braille has served in the place of visible print, and the long cane has supplemented spatial hearing in the sensing of obstacles and local features of the environment. For deaf people, lip reading and sign language have substituted for the loss of speech reception. Finally, for people who are both deaf and blind, fingerspelling by the sender in the palm of the receiver (Jaffe 1994; Reed et al. 1990) and the <b>Tadoma</b> method of speech reception (involving placement of the receiver's hand over the speaker's face) have provided a means by which they can receive messages from others (Reed et al. 1992). Assistive Technology and Sensory Substitution Over the last several decades, a number of new assistive technologies, many based on electronics and computers, have been adopted as more effective ways of promoting sensory substitution. This is especially true for ameliorating blindness. For example, access to print and other forms of text has been improved with these technologies: electronic braille displays, vibtrotactile display of optically sensed print (Bliss et al. 1970), and speech display of text sensed by video camera (Kurzweil 1989). For obstacle avoidance and sensing of the local environment, a number of ultrasonic sensors have been developed that use either auditory or tactil...|$|E
