500|$|During an {{interview}} for his new television series Homeland, 24 executive producer Howard Gordon addressed {{the impact of the}} series, describing it as [...] "stunning - everyone from Rush Limbaugh to Bill Clinton would talk about it, and we knew they were among our fans. I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I think our awareness of that changed the way we approached the series. So I guess you could call it a regret, but it was really an epiphany.|$|E

He won Game One 11–6, but lost the Game Five 1–0, which was a duel with former Blue Jays {{teammate}} Chris Carpenter. This loss eliminated the Phillies from the playoffs, a disappointment as they were touted as heavy favorites for the World Series, and {{it would turn out}} to be Halladay's final postseason appearance. Reflecting on that series at his retirement, Halladay said [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> thing I took away from that is you can have the best team on paper, you can have the guys who want it the most. But when the squirrel runs across home plate while your team is trying to pitch, there is nothing you can do about that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the album's creation, Sugababes {{signed a}} US record deal with Jay-Z's label Roc Nation. The album was {{recorded}} by Sugababes mostly in Los Angeles and New York {{but as a}} producer liked them so much they {{did a couple of}} sessions in London. The group primarily worked with RedOne, Ryan Tedder, Stargate, Fernando Garibay, up-and-coming production team the Smeezingtons (Phillip Lawrence and Bruno Mars). One of the album's tracks, [...] "No More You", was written by Ne-Yo. Keisha Buchanan compared the song to Rihanna's [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow". The group also collaborated with Sean Kingston. Sugababes also joked that [...] "Rihanna's been like our fourth member, listening to all our songs and saying what she liked and what she didn't like." [...] Buchanan told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat, the album has [...] "definitely got the British feel throughout the album - we've not gone away and gone 'All American' on our fans." [...] Buchanan continued, [...] "I think it's given us a fresh energy again. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> thing we wanted to do was come back with something different." [...] She also admitted the girls had become [...] "complacent" [...] around the time of Catfights and Spotlights but they also said that they are very proud of that album.|$|E

6000|$|And {{now comes}} a {{question}} which I find some difficulty in answering. Are the Zu-Vendi a civilized or barbarous people? Sometimes I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>one,</b> sometimes the other. In some branches of art they have attained the very highest proficiency. Take for instance their buildings and their statuary. I {{do not think}} that the latter can be equalled either in beauty or imaginative power anywhere in the world, and as for the former it may have been rivalled in ancient Egypt, but I am sure that it has never been since. But, on the other hand, they are totally ignorant of many other arts. Till Sir Henry, who happened to know something about it, showed them how to do it by mixing silica and lime, they could not make a piece of glass, and their crockery is rather primitive. A water-clock is their nearest approach to a watch; indeed, ours delighted them exceedingly. They know nothing about steam, electricity, or gunpowder, and mercifully for themselves nothing about printing or the penny post. Thus they are spared many evils, for of a truth our age has learnt the wisdom of the old-world saying, 'He who increaseth knowledge, increaseth sorrow.' ...|$|E

Of {{course it}} will be more {{difficult}} getting up there in the dark; but I shall make a detour of three or four miles, and come up on the other side, and we should be {{much more likely to be}} questioned if we were on foot than on horseback. Should we come upon any party of armed Boers, remember we have just arrived from Standerton, and finding when we got to Newcastle that the force had moved on, and were to take up their station at Talana Hill, we rode on to overtake them. When we get fairly there among them, we will dismount; Field and Peters will stand by the four horses, Horrocks and I will go on. If you hear a row, you will mount and wait a minute or two, and then if we do not come, you will ride off with our horses as well as your own. We shall try and make our way to the edge of the hill, and ought to be able to slip away in the darkness if we can get there before we are shot down or overtaken. However, I don't think there is much chance of our being recognized. Indeed, I expect most of them will be lying down for a sleep before the time comes for action. If there is one thing a Boer hates it is being kept awake at night. I will take one of the Kaffir boys with us. They can see in the dark a great deal better than we can; and as the Boers are sure to have some natives with them, he is quite as likely to pick up news as we are--more so, perhaps, for the natives will sit and talk all night while their masters are snoring.

6000|$|... 136. But if, {{on the one}} hand, mere {{abstract}} {{excellence of}} color be thus coldly regarded, it is equally certain that no work ever attains enduring celebrity which is eminently deficient in this great respect. Color cannot be indifferent; it is either beautiful and auxiliary to {{the purposes of the}} picture, or false, froward, and opposite to them. Even in the painting of Nature herself, this law is palpable; chiefly glorious when color is a predominant element in her working, she is in the next degree most impressive when it is withdrawn altogether: and forms and scenes become sublime in the neutral twilight, which were indifferent in the colors of noon. Much more is this the case in the feebleness of imitation; all color is bad which is less than beautiful; all is gross and intrusive which is not attractive; it repels where it cannot inthrall, and destroys what it cannot assist. It is besides the painter's peculiar craft; he who cannot color is no painter. It is not painting to grind earths with oil and lay them smoothly on a surface. He only is a painter who can melodize and harmonize hue--if he fail in this, he is no member of the brotherhood. Let him etch, or draw, or carve: better the unerring graver than the unfaithful pencil--better the true sling and stone than the brightness of the unproved armor. And let not even those who deal in the deeper magic, and feel in themselves the loftier power, presume upon that power--nor believe in the reality of any success unless that which has been deserved by deliberate, resolute, successive operation. We would neither deny nor disguise the influences of sensibility or of imagination, upon this, as upon every other admirable quality of art;--we know that there is that in the very stroke and fall of the pencil in a master's hand, which creates color with an unconscious enchantment--we {{know that there is a}} brilliancy which springs from the joy of the painter's heart--a gloom which sympathizes with its seriousness--a power correlative with its will; but these are all vain unless they be ruled by a seemly caution--a manly moderation--an indivertible foresight. This we <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> great conclusion to be received from the work we have been examining, that all power is vain--all invention vain--all enthusiasm vain--all devotion even, and fidelity vain, unless these are guided by such severe and exact law as we see take place in the development of every great natural glory; and, even in the full glow of their bright and burning operation, sealed by the cold, majestic, deep-graven impress of the signet on the right hand of Time.|$|E
