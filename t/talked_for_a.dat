[...] He was also adamant that Keaton would return and that Warner Bros. would not recast the role. Burton and Keaton have not officially signed on but will return if the script is good enough. Grahame-Smith met with Keaton in February 2012, [...] "We <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> couple of hours and talked about big picture stuff. It's a priority for Warner Bros.

[...] The story will be set in a real time frame from 1988; [...] "This will be a true 26 or 27 years later sequel. What's great is that for Beetlejuice , time means nothing in the afterlife, but the world outside is a different story." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the more}} notable events during the {{recording}} of Wish You Were Here occurred on 5 June 1975, the day Gilmour married his first wife, Ginger, {{on the eve of}} Pink Floyd's second US tour that year. [...] The band {{were in the process of}} completing the final mix of [...] "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" [...] when an overweight man with shaven head and eyebrows, and holding a plastic bag, entered the room.

[...] Wright was also mystified by the identity of the visitor, presumed he was a friend of Waters' and asked him, but soon realised that it was Syd Barrett. [...] Gilmour initially presumed he was an EMI staff member. Mason also failed to recognise him and was [...] "horrified" [...] when Gilmour identified him. [...] In Mason's personal memoir of Pink Floyd, , he recalled Barrett's conversation as [...] "desultory and not entirely sensible". Storm Thorgerson later reflected on Barrett's presence: [...] "Two or three people cried. [...] He sat round and <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bit but he wasn't really there." ...|$|E

I did not confess to him that I knew these feelings from my own personal experience. Yatsko and I <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time. Before leaving he kissed my face and hands; I should not have allowed this, and should have pushed him away, however I was punished afterwards by vague feelings of shame and remorse. He told me that, ever since the first time we met, his soul has been filled with rapturous feelings towards me, which grow all the time. How this reminds me of my own youth." [...] A few days later, KR and Yatsko met again, and a relationship developed between the two.|$|E
2500|$|When Narayanan {{returned}} to India in 1948, Laski {{gave him a}} letter of introduction to Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Years later, he narrated how {{he began his career}} in the public service:When I finished with LSE, Laski, of his own, gave me a letter of introduction for Panditji. On reaching Delhi I sought an appointment with the PM. I suppose, because I was an Indian student returning home from London, I was given a time-slot. It was here in Parliament House that he met me. We <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few minutes about London and things like that and I could soon see {{that it was time for}} me to leave. So I said goodbye and as I left the room I handed over the letter from Laski, and stepped out into the great circular corridor outside. When I was half way round, I heard the sound of someone clapping from the direction I had just come. I turned to see Panditji [...] beckoning me to come back. He had opened the letter as I left his room and read it. [...] "Why didn't you give this to me earlier?" [...] "Well, sir, I am sorry. I thought it would be enough if I just handed it over while leaving."
