The piloting hole, {{in conjunction with the}} two support pads, provides for the <b>tool</b> <b>balance</b> in the hole transverse cross-section. However, in the axial section plane, the tool alignment with the piloting hole depends on the boring bar to which the tool appears as a solid extension. This study shows that the alterations in the output quality and the support pads' wear pattern can be explained by in-process encountered boring bar bending. This is because even minor inclinations near the tool tip appear significant when considered in the small front-end area of the support pads where burnishing occurs. The study is to explain the inherent feature of the conventional self-piloting tool design to deflect the boring bar in 3 D enough to make a difference between the effective area involved in burnishing and the area as designed...|$|E

VanSumeren, University of Connecticut Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this controlled, {{randomized}} laboratory {{study was to determine}} the effect of hyperthermia, dehydration and fatigue as both combined and individual factors on balance performance as tested with three separate balance assessment tools. Methods: 12 healthy male subjects (20 ± 2 yrs old, 181. 83 ± 7. 53 cm, 74. 09 ± 8. 43 kg) completed four trials in a randomized order. The four trials were Normothermic, Hydrated (HyN), Normothermic Dehydrated (DehyN), Hyperthermic, Hydrated (HyHot), and Hyperthermic, Dehydrated (DehyHot). Balance was assessed using three tests; static stance, clinical <b>tool</b> <b>Balance</b> Error Scoring System (BESS), and a dynamic stance. Subjects performed the balance assessments three times during each trial; before exercise (pre-test), immediately after exercise (post-test) and after an hour of recovery (rec). The exercise component required subjects to walk on a 5 % incline treadmill for 90 minutes at a pre-determined speed between 3. 0 mph- 4. 0 mph. During the recovery period, subjects sat in the heat chamber with a water perfused suit on in order to maintain their exercising rectal temperature. Subjects were required to wear a 20. 45 kg pack during the entirety of the trial with the exception of the seated recovery period. Dependent variables were: center of pressure (COP), mean sway velocity, mean COP sway path, and average elliptical sway area for both the static and dynamic tests, as well as BESS individual stance scores and BESS total score. Separate repeated measures analyses of variance were performed to evaluate the dependent variables between time (pre-post-rec) and trials (HyN, DehyN, HyHot, DehyHot). Results: For the BESS test, a main effect for time was observed for three of the four stances; SLFirm (F(2, 22) = 5. 37, p=. 01), TanFirm (F(2, 22) = 4. 64, p=. 02), TanFoam (F(2, 22) = 3. 44, p=. 05). The post-test held the highest number of errors on any stance compared with the pre-test and the recovery test. Both the TanFirm and TanFoam revealed a main effect for condition (F(3, 33) = 3. 05, p=. 04, F(3, 33) = 7. 14, p=. 001, respectively). Overall, the DehyHot condition caused the highest BESS scores. For the Dynamic stance, a main effect for time was noticed for the variables of mean COP sway path and velocity (F(2, 22) = 7. 60, p=. 003, F(2, 22) = 7. 61, p=. 003, respectively) with the post-test resulting in the longest and fastest measures. All three variables demonstrated a main effect for condition; sway area (F(1. 93, 21. 26) = 3. 56, p=. 048), sway path (F(3. 33) = 3. 39, p=. 029), velocity (F(3, 33) = 3. 58, p=. 024). The DehyHot trial caused the biggest changes in postural sway. Static results revealed a main effect for time in sway path and sway velocity (F(2, 22) = 4. 03, p=. 032, F(91. 2, 13. 5) = 5. 56, p=. 045, respectively). Post-test scores caused the biggest change in sway. Conclusions: For all three of the balance assessments, there was a decrease in balance ability at post-test. The highest values on any balance assessment took place in the DehyHot trial, suggesting that when combined, dehydration and hyperthermia affect balance. Overall, balance deficits were driven mostly by fatigue in the dehydrated and hyperthermic condition...|$|E

30|$|When angled {{tools are}} used to cut the sheet (see Fig. 1), the {{progressive}} contact between the sheet and the angled tool reduces the required force {{at the expense of}} an increased tool stroke, and as stated by Guimaraes (1988), an increased deformation of the sheared sheet. Rake angles (the rake angle is defined in Fig. 3) up to 2 ° are common in larger shearing equipment, but angles larger than 5 ° are seldom used due to deformations that result in curl, camber, or bow of narrow strips, as discussed by Guimaraes (1988). Tools with rake angles also introduce a force along the tools (z-direction in Fig. 1). Although this force is small compared to forces in the other directions, it may affect the shearing if the equipment has a low stiffness in that direction. V-shaped <b>tools</b> <b>balance</b> the z-directional force and are therefore favorable, compared with unsymmetrical tools.|$|R

Due to the significant costs associated with incorporating such a tool in the software lifecycle, {{it is important to}} know what defects are detected and how accurate and efficient the analysis is. We focus specifically on popular static analysis tools for C code defects. Existing benchmarks include the actual defects in open source programs, but they lack systematic coverage of possible code defects and the coding complexities in which they arise. We introduce a test suite implementing the discussed requirements for frequent defects selected from public catalogues. Four open source and two commercial tools are compared in terms of their effectiveness and efficiency of their detection capability. A wide range of C constructs is taken into account and appropriate metrics are computed, which show how the <b>tools</b> <b>balance</b> inherent analysis tradeoffs and efficiency.
