30|$|The second {{direction}} for LSGO metaheuristics is a hybridization of multiple methods. Using {{more than one}} metaheuristic algorithm in a collaborative way usually increases {{the performance of the}} algorithm. A clear success trend in this direction was achieved by the hybridization of population-based metaheuristic with local search metaheuristic. The first endorses the exploration, while the latter endorses <b>the</b> <b>exploitations.</b> <b>The</b> rest of this section will further discuss recent algorithms that are related to these two directions.|$|R

Divisions between traditionalist and pro-European factions at the queen's court created opportunities that European intermediaries exploited {{in an attempt}} to hasten the succession of Ranavalona's son, Radama II. The young prince disagreed with many of his mother's policies and was amenable to French proposals for <b>the</b> <b>exploitation</b> of the island's resources, as expressed in the Lambert Charter he concluded with a French representative in 1855. These plans were never successful, however, and Radama II was not to take the throne until 1861, when Ranavalona died aged 83.|$|E

Palm oil is an essential ingredient in local cuisine. As a carefully preserved condiment, it is combined with plain rice on holidays. The oil comes from the fruit clusters which are picked by men and then deseeded, allowed to dry, crushed in a mortar, and boiled by women.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier was {{influenced}} {{by a number of}} authors. Jean Price Mars's Ainsi parla l'oncle (So Spoke the Uncle) presents two arguments that Carpentier applied to his historical approach: firstly, {{from the perspective of a}} Haitian peasant, the Revolution did nothing more than replace leaders, since <b>the</b> <b>exploitation</b> continued; secondly, Price Mars assumes the authenticity of the belief in African gods, in contrast with a shallow Catholicism. William Seabrook's The Magic Island made connections between religion and history and was considered a beautiful book by Carpentier.|$|E

Concessions for downloading are only issued to civilian satellites, yet some data has been indirectly used by armed forces.
