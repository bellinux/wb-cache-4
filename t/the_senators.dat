5|$|Due to the 'challenge' {{format of}} Stanley Cup play before 1915, {{there is often}} {{confusion}} about how many Stanley Cups <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> should be given credit for: nine, ten or eleven. <b>The</b> <b>Senators</b> were Stanley Cup champions {{at the end of}} nine hockey seasons without dispute. In another two seasons, 1905–06 and 1909–10, <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> won Stanley Cup challenges but were not champions {{at the end of the}} season. The Hockey Hall of Fame and the National Hockey League agree that <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> of 1906 were champions but disagree on whether <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> were champions in 1910. In both seasons, <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> were the undisputed defending champions, and during that year's hockey season, <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> won Stanley Cup challenges. However, by the end of both hockey seasons, they were no longer holders of the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|In the 1929–30 season, {{with cash}} still hemorrhaging, the team {{transferred}} two scheduled home games to Atlantic City (one each against the New York Rangers and New York Americans), two to Detroit, {{and one to}} Boston. <b>The</b> <b>Senators</b> rallied, however, {{to make the playoffs}} for a final time, finishing third in the Canadian Division. <b>The</b> <b>Senators</b> faced off against the New York Rangers in a two-game total-goals series. In the last NHL playoff game in Ottawa until 1996, <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> tied the Rangers 1–1 on March 28, 1930, but lost game two in New York 5–1 to lose the series 6 goals to 2. The season also marked the debut of future star Syd Howe with <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> while long-time star Frank Nighbor was sold to Toronto.|$|E

5|$|One {{month before}} <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> were {{to open the}} new Palladium, after three-straight last place finishes, and poor {{attendance}} at the Civic Centre, <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> organization was in turmoil. Star player Alexei Yashin, angered that management favoured Daigle over him despite posting higher numbers, was a contract hold-out. First-round draft choice Bryan Berard, who had left <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> training camp unsigned to a contract, had publicly stated {{that he would never}} report to <b>the</b> <b>Senators.</b> After Head Coach Rick Bowness demoted Daigle had been demoted to the fourth line, General Manager Randy Sexton fired Bowness and Assistant Coach Alain Vigneault on November 20, 1995. He replaced the coaches with Prince Edward Island Senators coach Dave Allison and gave the assistant coaching job to former Hartford Whalers Head Coach Pierre McGuire, who was working at the time as a scout for <b>the</b> <b>Senators.</b> Daigle was returned to full-time duty, but Sexton's changes did not improve the team's play.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Senators</b> would {{defeat the}} {{eventual}} Stanley Cup champion Canadiens 5–3 that night, {{but it would}} turn out to be their only highlight of the season for <b>the</b> <b>Senators.</b> The club would tie with the San Jose Sharks for the worst record in the League that year, winning just ten games with 70 losses and four ties (24 points) in the 1992–93 season. <b>The</b> <b>Senators</b> still hold the NHL record for least road wins for their record that season, with one. Their points total for the season was one point better than the NHL record for least points in a season ever. <b>The</b> <b>Senators</b> had aimed low. Firestone had set beating the old record the Senators' goal for the season, as the team planned to finish low in the standings for its first few years in order to receive high draft picks.|$|E

5|$|After the consulship {{had been}} {{opened to the}} plebeians, the plebeians were able to hold both the {{dictatorship}} and the censorship. Plebiscites of 342 BC placed limits on political offices; an individual could hold only one office at a time, and ten years must elapse {{between the end of}} his official term and his re-election. Further laws attempted to relieve the burden of debt from plebeians by banning interest on loans. In 337 BC, the first plebeian praetor was elected. During these years, the tribunes and <b>the</b> <b>senators</b> grew increasingly close. The senate realised the need to use plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals. To win over the tribunes, <b>the</b> <b>senators</b> gave the tribunes a great deal of power and the tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate. As the tribunes and <b>the</b> <b>senators</b> grew closer, plebeian senators were often able to secure the tribunate for members of their own families. In time, the tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the regular}} season success, the team entered the playoffs under a cloud. In February, Hasek had {{suffered}} an adductor muscle injury while playing for the Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team during the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. He had played only one game for the Czechs and returned to Ottawa to heal, but would never play for <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> again. Rookie goaltender Ray Emery had {{to take over the}} starting goaltender duties, leading the media to predict an early playoff exit due to Hasek's absence. Hopes were raised in the first round, however, when Emery would become the first rookie goaltender since Philadelphia's Brian Boucher in 2000 to win a playoff series when <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning four games to one. However, <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> then lost to the Buffalo Sabres in the second round, a series in which all games were decided by one goal.|$|E

When the Battalion left, the other Toronto team, the Blueshirts was suspended by the league and its players dispersed including Corb Denneny, brother of Cy Denneny, who joined <b>the</b> <b>Senators.</b> Future Hall of Famer Cy had been picked up in a trade with Toronto earlier that season and he would be a member of <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> until 1928. Benedict was the NHA's top goaltender once again, and Nighbor tied for the scoring lead with 41 goals in 19 games. As second-half winners, <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> played off in a series with the Canadiens, the first-half winners. <b>The</b> <b>Senators</b> ended their play in the NHA by losing a two-game total goals playoff series to the Canadiens, who eventually lost to Seattle in the Stanley Cup final.
