Coach Kleats rarely has confidence in him, so Dilton more commonly ends up showing his school spirit by wearing the team mascot costume. However, he has been shown to be able to use his mathematical ability to pitch baseballs like a professional. Even when he is relegated to being Riverdale High's baseball team scorekeeper, he is still a valuable asset even though he once disappointed a girl interested in him who thought he was a regular player. This happened when he noticed that a team winning against Riverdale had committed a batting out of <b>turn</b> <b>error,</b> told Coach Kleats, who then informed the umpire as required in the rules for a judgement and the umpire declared the offending player was out, which allowed Riverdale to win with the opportunity.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{a kind of}} {{position}} control method based on double speed closed loops is proposed to reduce <b>turning</b> <b>error</b> and nonlinear dead zone, which are caused by the flexibility and nonlinear friction in harmonic drive system. The speed loop of motor side is the inner loop and the speed loop of load side is the outer loop. Besides, the robustness performances of double speed loops and single speed loop are analyzed in theory, respectively. And it is stated that the performance of double speed loops {{is better than the}} performance of single speed loop. Furthermore, to further reduce the <b>turning</b> <b>error</b> and enhance the precision of system, the article puts forward applying double proportional–integral controllers with double extended state observers in the two speed loops. Extended state observers can transform the nonlinear models into an approximate linear model and eliminate the nonlinear frictions in the system. Finally, a few comparative experimental results show that the proposed control method has better performance for restraining the nonlinear features and enhancing the precision of the harmonic drive system...|$|R

40|$|Right heart {{catheterisation}} (RHC) plays {{a central}} role in identifying pulmonary hypertension (PH) disorders, and is required to definitively diagnose pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Despite widespread acceptance, {{there is a lack of}} guidance regarding the best practice for performing RHC in clinical practice. In order to ensure the correct evaluation of haemodynamic parameters directly measured or calculated from RHC, attention should be drawn to standardising procedures such as the position of the pressure transducer and catheter balloon inflation volume. Measurement of pulmonary arterial wedge pressure, in particular, is vulnerable to over- or under-wedging, which can give rise to false readings. In <b>turn,</b> <b>errors</b> in RHC measurement and data interpretation can complicate the differentiation of PAH from other PH disorders and lead to misdiagnosis. In addition to diagnosis, the role of RHC in conjunction with noninvasive tests is widening rapidly to encompass monitoring of treatment response and establishing prognosis of patients diagnosed with PAH.

40|$|Axons use {{temporal}} and directional guidance cues at intermediate targets {{to set the}} rate and direction of growth towards their synaptic targets. Our {{recent studies have shown}} that disrupting the temporal guidance process, by unilaterally accelerating the rate at which spinal dI 1 (commissural) axons grow, resulted in <b>turning</b> <b>errors</b> both in the ventral spinal cord and after crossing the floor plate. Here we investigate a mechanistic explanation for these defects: the accelerated dI 1 axons arrive in the ventral spinal cord before necessary fasciculation cues from incoming dI 1 axons from {{the opposite side of the}} spinal cord. The identification of such an interaction would support a model of selective fasciculation whereby the pioneering dI 1 axons serve as guides for the processes of the bilaterally symmetrical population of dI 1 neurons. To test this model, we first developed the ability to "double" in ovo electroporate the embryonic chicken spinal cord to independently manipulate the rate of growth of the two bilateral populations of dI 1 axons. Second, we examined the requirement for a putative bilateral interaction by unilaterally ablating the dI 1 population in cultured explants of chicken embryonic spinal cord. Surprisingly, we find no evidence for a bilateral dI 1 axon interaction, rather dI 1 axons appear to project independently of each other...|$|R

The device consists of a curved, cantilevered steering arm, mounted on an untethered scratch drive actuator. These two components are fabricated monolithically from the same sheet of conductive polysilicon, and receive a common power and control signal through a capacitive coupling with an underlying electrical grid. All locations on the grid receive the same power and control signal, so that the devices can be operated without knowledge of their position on the substrate and without constraining rails or tethers. Control and power delivery waveforms are broadcast to the device through the capacitive power coupling, and are decoded by the electromechanical response of the device body. Individual control of the component actuators provides two distinct motion gaits (forward motion and turning), which together allow full coverage of a planar workspace (the robot is globally controllable).
