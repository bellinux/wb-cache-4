[1] Discrete cosine transform (DCT) is computationally intensive algorithm it has lot of electronics application. DCT transforms the information time or space domain into frequency domain to provide compact representation, fast <b>transmission,</b> <b>memory</b> saving. [1]. DCT is very effective due to symmetry and simplicity. Image consists of pixels depending on image size. Ex. :- for 8 * 8 images, maximum pixel size 0 to 255. This project is dealing with image compression, for that there is need to implement DCT process on a particular image which will reduce the pixel size of that image. For Grayscale image compression using DCT, initially selected 256 * 256 image and access or read this image into MATLAB for DCT computation, Then found that after DCT process over image o...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{there has been}} great {{interest}} {{in the study of}} buffer management policies in the context of packet transmission for network switches. In a typical model, a switch receives packets on one or more input ports, with each packet having a designated output port through which it should be transmitted. An online policy must consider bandwidth limits on the rate of <b>transmission,</b> <b>memory</b> constraints impacting the buffering of packets within a switch, and variations in packet properties used to differentiate quality of service. With so many constraints, a switch {{may not be able to}} deliver all packets, in which case some will be dropped.

40|$|A {{construction}} of big convolutional codes from short codes called block Markov superposition transmission (BMST) is proposed. The BMST {{is very similar}} to superposition blockMarkov encoding (SBME), which has been widely used to prove multiuser coding theorems. The encoding process of BMST can be as fast as that of the involved short code, while the decoding process can be implemented as an iterative sliding-window decoding algorithm with a tunable delay. More importantly, the performance of BMST can be simply lower-bounded in terms of the <b>transmission</b> <b>memory</b> given that the performance of the short code is available. Numerical results show that, 1) the lower bounds can be matched with a moderate decoding delay in the low bit-error-rate (BER) region, implying that the iterative slidingwindow decoding algorithm is near optimal; 2) BMST with repetition codes and single parity-check codes can approach the Shannon limit within 0. 5 dB at BER of 10 ^{- 5 } {{for a wide range of}} code rates; and 3) BMST can also be applied to nonlinear codes...|$|E
40|$|Human {{evolution}} {{is characterized by}} the rapid expansion of brain size and drastic increase in cognitive capabilities. It has long been suggested that these changes were accompanied by modifications of brain metabolism. Indeed, human-specific changes on gene expression or amino acid sequence were reported for a number of metabolic genes, but actual metabolite measurements in humans and apes have remained scarce. Here, we investigate concentrations of more than 100 metabolites in the prefrontal and cerebellar cortex in 49 humans, 11 chimpanzees, and 45 rhesus macaques of different ages using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). We show that the brain metabolome undergoes substantial changes, both ontogenetically and evolutionarily: 88 % of detected metabolites show significant concentration changes with age, whereas 77 % of these metabolic changes differ significantly among species. Although overall metabolic divergence reflects phylogenetic relationships among species, we found a fourfold acceleration of metabolic changes in prefrontal cortex compared with cerebellum in the human lineage. These human-specific metabolic changes are paralleled by changes in expression patterns of the corresponding enzymes, and affect pathways involved in synaptic <b>transmission,</b> <b>memory,</b> and learning...|$|E

40|$|The UDP-N-acetylglucosamine- 2 -epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (Gne) gene encodes a key bifunctional enzyme {{important}} in initiating and regulating sialic acid (Sia) synthesis. Sia is commonly {{expressed as a}} terminal (non-reducing) sugar residue on oligosaccharide side chains on cell surface glycoconjugates where it mediates many carbohydrate receptor interactions, particularly in the neural and immune systems. The myriad of functions include nerve cell <b>transmission,</b> <b>memory</b> formation,cell-cell adhesion and communication, and lymphocyte extravasation. Sia is also {{a major component of}} human milk oligosaccharides where its level has been correlated with enhanced cognitive function and memory. There is no information, however, if early dietary Sia supplementation that increases the intracellular levels of Sia, may regulate Gne gene expression in developing piglets. To study this possible regulation, we cloned and sequenced a 4. 3 kb of pig Gne cDNA (4326 nt), including 2169 -nucleotides in the coding region. The Gne cDNA showed 91. 9 % and 98. 9 % identities to the human counterparts in the nucleotide and protein sequences, respectively. There are only eight amino acid differences between human and pig Gne, making the pig cDNA closer in homology to the human than the orthologs from mouse, rat, hamster, chicken, frog or zebrafish. The piglets Gne gene is highly expressed in the hippocampus, liver, and thymus followed by the pancreas, frontal cortex, lungs, kidneys, heart and spleen. The lowest level of expression was in skeletal muscle. Importantly, we have now shown that dietary Sia supplementation in developing piglets with a Sia-rich glycopeptide and active learning increased the Gne mRNA expression levels 2 to 3 -fold in brain hippocampus and liver. These findings suggest that normal brain development and active learning increases the requirement for sialylated glycoconjugates, including neural cell adhesion molecules (N-CAM), and brain gangliosides. 11 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The work {{presents}} a configurable network interface (NI) macrocell {{to be integrated}} in Spidergon network-on-chip (NoC) infrastructures, and addresses the problem of its functional verification. The NI architecture supports multiple native bus for the IP cells connected to the NoC and the conversion of data size, protocol and frequency between the NoC and each IF. Differently from many state-of-art NI designs the proposed macrocell features also the hardware implementation of advanced networking features such as security, order handling, error management, store and forward <b>transmission,</b> <b>memory</b> remapping, power management. Such a configurable and complex design poses several challenges in terms of functional verification. Direct HDL testbenches fails covering corner cases and typically are based on handwritten testbenches that are error-prone. In formal methods the verification engineer tries to extract deterministic laws/relationships internal to the HDL description, and then to prove theorems to check the netlist functional behavior. However in complex designs the state explosion problem limits model checking, {{and the cost of}} theorem proving becomes prohibitive because of the amount of skilled manual guidance it requires. To overcome such issues a constrained-random coverage-driven approach is presented and customized to be applied to the novel NI as design under test (DUT). Starting from DUT specifications, a software verification platform is created performing these tasks: generating traffic patterns which are constrained-random, i. e. random within variations ranges specified by the user; monitoring the DUT outputs and checking them according to pre-programmed rules; parsing collected outputs into a functional coverage scheme to check if all possible cases have been stressed and covered by the tests. This enables a coverage-driven verification: the user continues developing and running tests until there are no holes left in the coverage plan. As result of this verification strategy full code and functional coverage is achieved. Implementation results of the verified NI core in 45 nm and 65 nm CMOS technologies are also provided and compared to state-of-art NI designs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

30|$|With {{the recent}} big data’s revolutionary growth, various {{processing}} frameworks were developed. Some of these frameworks best fit streaming data, while {{others can be}} applied to batch data. In this paper, we experimented two of these popular frameworks for our k-anonymity method. Both of Pig and Spark were examined in MDSBA anonymization process. Our aim was paving a reliable ground for MDSBA state-of-the-art anonymization with the most reliable performance. The experiments show few hurdles in each framework. However, Spark is faster in processing MDSBA, and more fault tolerant as an in-memory operations framework. In congested networks, Spark reduces data <b>transmission</b> between <b>memory</b> and disks on serializing data with RDD. Spark can be many times faster than Pig MapReduce in anonymization. To avoid SQL Spark performance degradation, the memory should be larger than the processed data. SQL Spark boosts performance on the large size of memory. Other Spark’s tuning methods that may leverage the anonymization performance are; UDF algorithm, filter/group commands, and caching data in memory. On the other side, MapReduce is an old framework that can perform better when memory resources are quite small. This is conditioned by the network traffic and congestion level. MapReduce may operate on small memory resources, but it requires non-busy network, because it relies on a heavy <b>transmission</b> between <b>memory</b> and disks. In the conclusion, It is recommended to implement MDSBA in Spark framework, however, the cluster infrastructure must be prepared well, by providing enough memory and processor resources for each node.|$|R

The value of the concept is that it enables us to see, inter alia, how communities of memory emerge. Our route into this is the sociology of generations and most particularly the evidence of mnemonic transmission provided by second-generation Holocaust narratives. The purpose of the article is to bring together a range of work relevant to the sharing and inheritance of memory across and within time, to explore the application of collective mnemonic frames in processes of personal remembering, and so move us closer to understanding the mechanism by which experience derived from others becomes integrated into our own life-stories...|$|R
