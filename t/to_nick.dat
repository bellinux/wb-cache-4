5|$|Crytek then {{pitched the}} game to {{different}} publishers, and eventually, in 2009, the company pitched the two projects to Microsoft. According <b>to</b> <b>Nick</b> Button-Brown, the general manager at Crytek, the game was not functional at that time, and only served {{to prove to the}} publisher that a first-person melee game was fun for players. The representative from Microsoft, Phil Spencer, admired Crytek's intention to expand, and thought that Microsoft's games line up for the Xbox 360 was lacking a first-person melee-combat game. As a result, they accepted to publish Kingdoms, and rejected Kings. The two companies agreed that the project would be a natural fit for Microsoft's yet-to-be-announced Kinect.|$|E

40|$|Mammalian DNA ligase III {{exists as}} two {{distinct}} isoforms denoted alpha and beta. Both forms possess a motif that is homologous to the putative zinc finger present in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Here, {{the role of}} this motif in the binding and ligation of nicked DNA and RNA substrates in vitro has been examined in both isoforms. Disruption of the putative zinc finger did not affect DNA ligase III activity on nicked DNA duplex, nor did it abolish DNA ligase III-alpha activity during DNA base excision repair in a cell-free assay. In contrast, disruption of this motif reduced 3 -fold the activity of both DNA ligase III isoforms on nicked RNA present in RNA/DNA homopolymers. Furthermore, whereas disruption of the motif did not prevent binding of DNA ligase III <b>to</b> <b>nicked</b> DNA duplex, binding <b>to</b> <b>nicked</b> RNA homopolymers was reduced approximately 10 -fold. These {{results suggest that the}} putative zinc finger does not stimulate DNA ligase III activity on simple nicked DNA substrates, but indicate that this motif can target the binding and activity of DNA ligase III <b>to</b> <b>nicked</b> RNA homopolymer. The implications of these results to the cellular role of the putative zinc finger are discussed...|$|R
