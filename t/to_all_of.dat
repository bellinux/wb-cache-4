5|$|A {{challenge}} <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> {{these alternative}} scenarios came when Turner and colleagues in 2007 described a new dromaeosaurid, Mahakala, which they {{found to be}} the most basal and most primitive member of the Dromaeosauridae, more primitive than Microraptor. Mahakala had short arms and no ability to glide. Turner et al. also inferred that flight evolved only in the Avialae, and these two points suggested that the ancestral dromaeosaurid could not glide or fly. Based on this cladistic analysis, Mahakala suggests that the ancestral condition for dromaeosaurids is non-volant. However, in 2012, an expanded and revised study incorporating the most recent Dromaeosaurid finds recovered the Archaeopteryx-like Xiaotingia as the most primitive member of the clade Dromaeosauridae, which appears to suggest the earliest members of the clade may have been capable of flight.|$|E
5|$|A {{thousand}} years before The Sword of Shannara, an Elf named Galaphile gathers {{all of the}} people who still had some knowledge of the old world to Paranor to try to bring peace and order <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the races. They name themselves the First Druid Council. Brona, a rogue Druid, and his followers leave, taking the Ildatch with them; this magical tome controls their minds. 250 years later, Brona begins the First War of the Races when he convinces all Men to attack the other races. He almost succeeds in seizing rule of the Four Lands, but the tide turns, and the war ends with his defeat and disappearance. The Druids divide the Four Lands among the races and become reclusive, withdrawing to Paranor because of their shame at the betrayal by one of their own members.|$|E

5|$|All of the {{children}} attended the nearby George Street State School {{and one by one}} the brothers joined the Fitzroy Cricket Club as they reached their early teens. The club had a program whereby they gave a medal for every local school to award to the best cricketer in their ranks in that year. The successful student would then be given access <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the club's facilities. All of the Harvey brothers were recipients were of this medal. At Fitzroy, they came under the influence of former Victorian all-rounder Arthur Liddicut and the club's veteran captain Joe Plant. The Harveys had no formal coaching, and their father, although a regular presence at the club, chose to stay in the background as their respective careers developed. Horace did not advise his sons on how to bat, allowing them to formulate their own style and technique. According to the Harvey brothers, it was their mother who was vocal and extroverted, in contrast to their reserved father. The boys who failed to score runs were given kitchen duty and according to them, their parents never showed favouritism.|$|E
5|$|An {{exception}} <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> {{this would}} be the Primal Zerg, who inhabit the original Zerg homeworld of Zerus (as seen in Heart of the Swarm). The Zerg Hive Mind was created to control the Zerg, and eventually put them {{under the control of the}} main antagonist of the series, the fallen Xel'Naga Amon. Some Zerg, however, managed to avoid being subsumed. These are the Primal Zerg, who have much the same genetic abilities but are not bound to the Overmind. These creatures are each independently sapient, and if they follow a leader it is because they choose to. Their lack of a Hive Mind also shields them from specific psionic attacks engineered to counter the Zerg Hive Mind.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 75, Isaac {{moved to}} Beer-lahai-roi after his father died. When the land {{experienced}} famine, he removed to the Philistine land of Gerar where his father once lived. This land was still {{under the control of}} King Abimelech {{as it was in the}} days of Abraham. Like his father, Isaac also deceived Abimelech about his wife and also got into the well business. He had gone back <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the wells that his father dug and saw that they were all stopped up with earth. The Philistines did this after Abraham died. So, Isaac unearthed them and began to dig for more wells all the way to Beersheba, where he made a pact with Abimelech, just like in the day of his father.|$|E

5|$|By December 15, {{newspapers}} had attributed 286 deaths to the blizzard, including 54 in New York, 51 in New Jersey (later {{confirmed as}} 52), 26 in Pennsylvania, and 71 in the New England states. Fatalities {{related to the}} storm and associated cold snap were far-reaching, involving 23 states. A wide variety of factors contributed to the high death toll, including over-exertion, exposure to cold, transportation accidents, structural fires, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The storm caused some isolated power failures along its path. In north-central Virginia, telephone and electricity lines were damaged. The blizzard cut electricity <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Newtown, Connecticut, though it was mostly restored within hours. In Rhode Island, Block Island and some inland towns were without power. Short-lived power outages affected southern New Hampshire.|$|E
5|$|By July, {{attempts}} at conciliation had completely collapsed. Maria Theresa's ally, the Elector of Saxony, now became her enemy and GeorgeII declared the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg to be neutral. The Queen {{was once again}} {{in need of help}} from Hungary. In order to obtain it, she granted favours to the Hungarian noblemen and flattered them without conceding <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> their demands. She had already won their support when she appeared in Pressburg in September 1741, hoping to persuade the Diet to call a mass conscription and recognise Francis Stephen as co-ruler. Upon achieving both goals, she showed her gift for theatrical displays by triumphantly holding her son and heir, Joseph, before the Diet, thereby gaining sympathy of the noblemen.|$|E

5|$|Clement {{argues for}} the {{equality}} of sexes, {{on the grounds that}} salvation is extended <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> mankind equally. Unusually, he suggests that Christ is neither male or female, and that God the Father has both male and female aspects: the eucharist is described as milk from the breast (Christ) of the Father. He is supportive of women playing {{an active role in the}} leadership of the church, and provides a list of women he considers inspirational, which includes both Biblical and Classical Greek figures. It has been suggested that Clement's progressive views on gender as set out in the Paedagogus were influenced by Gnosticism. However, later in the work, he argues against the Gnostics that faith, not esoteric knowledge , is required for salvation. According to Clement, it is through faith in Christ that we are enlightened and come to know God.|$|E

To the left of the relief is depicted the Trinity – Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma, while to the right is a human couple and a mother cow with a calf feeding.|$|E
