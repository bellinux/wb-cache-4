5|$|As modern {{communities}} continued {{growing in}} and around Miami, developers looked to southern Dade County for new projects. The undeveloped keys south of Key Biscayne were viewed as prime development territory. Beginning in the 1890s local interests promoted {{the construction of a}} causeway to the mainland. One proposal included building a highway linking the Biscayne Bay keys to the Overseas Highway at Key Largo and to the developed barrier islands to the north. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>pressure</b> built to accommodate industrial development in South Florida. This led to competing priorities between those who wished to develop for residential and leisure use and those in favor of industrial and infrastructure development. On December 6, 1960, 12 of the 18 area landowners who favored development voted to create the City of Islandia on Elliott Key. The town was incorporated to encourage Dade County to improve access to Elliott Key in particular, which landowners viewed as a potential rival to Miami Beach. The new city lobbied for causeway access and formed a negotiating bloc to attract potential developers.|$|E
25|$|Cultural {{resources}} management has, however, been criticized. CRM {{is conducted}} by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining {{the work to}} be done and an expected budget. It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding. CRM archaeologists face considerable <b>time</b> <b>pressure,</b> often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour. Compounding the <b>time</b> <b>pressure</b> is the vetting process of site reports that are required (in the US) to be submitted by CRM firms to the appropriate State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). From the SHPO's perspective there is to be no difference between a report submitted by a CRM firm operating under a deadline, and a multi-year academic project. The end result is that for a Cultural Resource Management archaeologist to be successful, they must be able to produce academic quality documents at a corporate world pace.|$|E

This study conducted with survey method on auditors working in audit firms at three mayor cities in Indonesia i. e; Jakarta, Surabaya, and Medan, with samples are 348 respondents. This research used structural equation model as data analysis. The results of this study sugget that external locus of control has positive and significant relation with perceived <b>time</b> budget <b>pressure</b> and URT behaviors. Relation of affective professional commitment with perceived <b>time</b> budget <b>pressure</b> and URT behaviors is not significant. Relation of continuance professional commitment to perceived <b>time</b> budget <b>pressure</b> and (URT) behaviors is not significant. Normative profesional commitment is inversely related to perceived <b>time</b> budget <b>pressure</b> and URT behaviors. Perceived <b>time</b> budget <b>pressure</b> has positive and significant relation with URT behaviors.

The face-lifts and rebranding of AMC's once-innovative and successful cars were not enough in a competitive landscape that had changed dramatically. No longer was the threat limited to the Big Three automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler). The Japanese manufacturers (Honda, Toyota, Nissan) used streamlined production methods such as outsourcing and Just In Time (JIT) supply-chain management. They had new, highly efficient assembly plants in the United States. And now they targeted the heart of AMC's passenger product line: small cars.|$|E
25|$|Many puzzles {{in these}} games involve {{gathering}} and using items from their inventory. Players must apply lateral thinking techniques where they apply real-world extrinsic knowledge about objects in unexpected ways. For example, {{by putting a}} deflated inner tube on a cactus to create a slingshot, which requires a player to realize that an inner tube is stretchy. They may need to carry items in their inventory for a long duration before they prove useful, and thus it is normal for adventure games to test a player's memory where a challenge can only be overcome by recalling a piece of information from earlier in the game. There is seldom any <b>time</b> <b>pressure</b> for these puzzles, focusing more on the player's ability to reason than on quick-thinking.|$|E

40|$|This study explores patients' and physicians' {{perceptions}} {{of the use of}} medical terminology in patient-physician communication. Perceptions of time emerge as an overarching theme and the relationships between perceived <b>time</b> <b>pressures</b> and medical terms are analyzed. Data for this qualitative exploratory study were collected in 28 semistructured interviews with native and nonnative English-speaking physicians and patients. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed in NVivo 8, applying principles from grounded theory. Participants commonly perceived <b>time</b> <b>pressures</b> on consultations. Findings indicate that together, perceived <b>time</b> <b>pressures</b> and medical terminology influence patient participation and the development of rapport in medical encounters. Patient information-seeking behavior was reported to be lower in short, terminology-dense consultations and increased in longer, terminology-sparse consultations. Data suggest that monitoring the use of medical terms in combination with taking time to provide appropriate explanations can function as a partnership-building strategy. Physicians who adopt this strategy could foster better patient-physician relationships and facilitate increased patient information-seeking behavior. 8 page(s...|$|R

25|$|Remarkable is, for example, the {{increase}} in non-occupational activities with obligation character, which include mainly house and garden work, maintenance and support of family members or volunteer activities. All this {{can contribute to the}} perception of a chronic lack of time. This <b>time</b> <b>pressure</b> is, amongst others, influenced by their own age, the age and number of children in the household, marital status, the profession and level of employment as well as the income level. The psychological strain, which in turn affects the health, increases due to the strong pressure of time, but also by the complexity of work, growing responsibilities, concern for long-term existential protection and more. The mentioned stresses and strains could lead in the long term to irreversible, physical signs of wear as well as to negative effects on the human cardiovascular and immune systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacities}} and demands {{model has been}} proposed {{to account for the}} heterogeneity of the disorder. In this approach, speech performance varies depending on the capacity that the individual has for producing fluent speech, and the demands placed upon the person by the speaking situation. Capacity for fluent speech may be affected by a predisposition to the disorder, auditory processing or motor speech deficits, and cognitive or affective issues. Demands may be increased by internal factors such as lack of confidence or self esteem or inadequate language skills or external factors such as peer pressure, <b>time</b> <b>pressure,</b> stressful speaking situations, insistence on perfect speech, and the like. In stuttering, the severity of the disorder is seen as likely to increase when demands placed on the person's speech and language system exceed their capacity to deal with these pressures. However, the precise nature of the capacity or incapacity has not been delineated.|$|E
25|$|A {{tourniquet}} can {{be defined}} as a constricting or compressing device used to control arterial and venous blood flow to a portion of an extremity for a period of <b>time.</b> <b>Pressure</b> is applied circumferentially around a portion of a limb at a desired location; this pressure is transferred to the walls of blood vessels, causing them to become temporarily occluded or restricted. In surgical settings, a tourniquet is used to occlude arterial blood flow following exsanguination to produce a relatively bloodless operative field and to minimize blood loss. In emergency settings, a tourniquet is used stop traumatic bleeding such that medical care can be provided in time before the injured person bleeds out. In rehabilitation settings, a tourniquet is used to restrict arterial blood flow at a consistent and safe pressure for short periods of time during low intensity exercise to more rapidly increase muscle size and strength.|$|E

25|$|A {{ventilator}} assists breathing {{using either}} pressure control or volume control {{based on the}} equation of motion for the respiratory system. Providing assistance means doing work on the patient, which is accomplished by controlling either pressure or volume. A simple mathematical model describing this fact {{is known as the}} equation of motion for the passive respiratory system: Pressure = (Elastance × Volume) + (Resistance × Flow)In this equation, pressure, volume, and flow are all continuous functions of <b>time.</b> <b>Pressure</b> is actually a pressure difference across the system (e.g., transrespiratory pressure defined as pressure at the airway opening minus pressure on the body surface). Elastance (defined as the change in pressure divided by the associated change in volume; the reciprocal of compliance) and resistance (defined as a change in pressure divided by the associated change in flow) are parameters assumed to remain constant during a breath.Volume control (VC) means that both volume and flow are preset prior to inspiration. In other words, the right hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while pressure changes with changes in elastance and resistance.Pressure control (PC) means that inspiratory pressure is preset as either a constant value or it is proportional to the patient’s inspiratory effort. In other words, the left-hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while volume and flow change with changes in elastance and resistance.Time control (TC) means that, in some rare situations, none of the main variables (pressure, volume, or flow) are preset. In this case only the inspiratory and expiratory times are preset.|$|E
