5|$|Ripley, Lambert, and Parker {{agree to}} self-destruct the Nostromo and escape in <b>the</b> <b>shuttle.</b> Parker and Lambert {{are killed by}} the alien while {{gathering}} life-support supplies. Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence and heads with the cat to <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> to find the alien in her path. She retreats and attempts unsuccessfully to abort the self-destruct. She returns to <b>the</b> <b>shuttle,</b> where the alien is gone, and she narrowly escapes in <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> as the Nostromo explodes.|$|E
5|$|After the ASTP {{mission was}} completed, Lunney became manager of <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Payload Integration and Development Program. During this period, it was {{anticipated}} that NASA's space shuttle fleet would be flying very frequent missions, and carrying commercial payloads {{as well as}} flying missions for government {{organizations such as the}} Department of Defense and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The payload integration program was responsible for determining how the various demands of these customers could be satisfied, and how mixed payloads could best be physically accommodated within the cargo bay of <b>the</b> <b>shuttle.</b> During these years Lunney also spent time working at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., as Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Flight and later as Acting Associate Administrator for Space Transportation Operations.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} 2015–2019 MTA Capital Program, the 42nd Street Shuttle {{will become}} ADA accessible, and <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> will be reconfigured from three tracks to two tracks, and the trains will become six cars long. The whole project will cost $235.41 million. The {{platforms}} at Times Square will be extended {{to allow for a}} second point of entry at Sixth Avenue, with a connection to the IND Sixth Avenue Line. The Times Square station will be rehabilitated with congestion mitigation measures. A wider stairway would be installed from <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> mezzanine to street level, a new control area would be installed {{at the bottom of the}} stairway, and 21 columns would be removed. The cost of this part of the project is $28.93 million. Also included in the Capital Program is funding for a study that would develop the requirements for a second program to automate <b>the</b> <b>shuttle.</b> The cost of this part of the project is $30 million. The project is delayed, and construction will start in May 2018.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Shuttle's</b> {{delta wing}} design {{was driven by}} these issues. These {{requirements}} were further exacerbated by military requirements (the USAF would use <b>the</b> future <b>shuttle</b> for defense satellite payloads and other missions) that extended <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle's</b> flight landing envelope.|$|R
50|$|After {{reaching}} orbit, Atlantis' crew began {{procedures to}} open <b>the</b> <b>shuttle’s</b> payload bay doors {{and set up}} computers and other equipment. They also powered up <b>the</b> <b>shuttle's</b> robotic arm to check its operation. Photos taken during the robotic arm checkout showed a 4-inch by 6-inch corner area of insulation blanket on <b>the</b> <b>shuttle's</b> port orbital maneuvering system (OMS) pod pulled away from an adjacent row of heat-shield tiles.|$|R
50|$|Two course {{correction}} burns {{were also}} performed on Flight Day 2. The first 10-second burn, dubbed NC-2, was performed using the right-hand OMS engine, changing <b>the</b> <b>shuttle's</b> speed by 8 ft/s. The burn raised both the apogee and perigee of <b>the</b> <b>shuttle's</b> orbit by 1 mi. Atlantis reaction control jets were again fired {{for a second}} time to execute the 8-second NC-3 burn, which changed <b>the</b> <b>shuttle's</b> velocity by about 2 ft/s.|$|R
5|$|As she {{prepares for}} stasis, Ripley finds the alien has stowed-away aboard <b>the</b> <b>shuttle.</b> She {{puts on a}} {{spacesuit}} and opens the shuttle's airlock. The explosive decompression forces the alien into the airlock doorway. She shoots it with a grappling hook to propel it into space, but the gun catches as the airlock closes, tethering the alien to <b>the</b> <b>shuttle.</b> It attempts to crawl {{into one of the}} engines but Ripley fires them to blast the alien into space. After recording the voyage final log entry, she places herself and the cat into stasis for the trip home to Earth.|$|E
5|$|At 08:15:44UTC on 18 November, Atlantis undocked {{from the}} docking module's bottom {{androgynous}} unit, leaving the docking module permanently {{attached to the}} Kristall module, where it provided clearance between <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> and Mirs solar arrays during subsequent dockings.|$|E
5|$|Cameron, Hadfield {{and other}} {{available}} crew members also {{spent the morning}} answering questions posed by Canadian reporters located in Montreal and Toronto. Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency astronaut, was the fourth Canadian astronaut to fly on <b>the</b> <b>shuttle.</b>|$|E

30|$|We {{assign the}} indices 0, 1,…, 7 to <b>the</b> eight <b>shuttles</b> in <b>the</b> {{following}} way: <b>the</b> <b>shuttles</b> that are above the board are labelled 0, 1, 2, 3 in the clockwise order starting with <b>the</b> front-left <b>shuttle</b> and <b>the</b> <b>shuttles</b> below are labelled 4, 5, 6, 7 {{in a similar}} way. Hence <b>Shuttle</b> 0 is <b>the</b> front-left <b>shuttle</b> that is above <b>the</b> board, <b>Shuttle</b> 1 is <b>the</b> back-left <b>shuttle</b> above <b>the</b> board, <b>Shuttle</b> 2 <b>the</b> back-right <b>shuttle</b> above <b>the</b> board, and so on. The dimensions of each shuttle are 195 mm (in the horizontal direction) and 160 mm (in the vertical direction). The dimensions of the board are 1050 mm (in the horizontal direction) and 850 mm (in the vertical direction). We will use these constants in the model but obviously they can be replaced by other constants if the covering problem must be solved for another system. Each shuttle has a preferred corner, corresponding {{to the point where}} its power chain is attached to the board. For instance, the preferred corner of <b>the</b> front-left <b>shuttle</b> that is above (resp. below) the board is the front-left corner of this shuttle.|$|R
5|$|Chris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency {{astronaut}} and STS-74 mission specialist, {{used the}} shuttle's robot arm to hoist the docking module {{out of the}} aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, and moved it to within five inches of the Orbiter Docking System. At that point, <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> fired its downward steering jets and moved <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> toward the docking module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, the docking ring on the Orbiter Docking System retracted, {{and a series of}} hooks and latches were engaged to ensure an airtight seal between the two spacecraft.|$|E

They find that <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> has crashed on a desolate planet, Vagra II, {{and while they}} can find the life signs of Troi and the pilot, {{they are unable to}} beam the two to the ship. An away team beams down and discovers an animated pool of a tar-like substance, a malevolent life form that calls itself Armus. When Lt. Yar attempts to approach <b>the</b> <b>shuttle,</b> Armus hurls her back with a psychokinetic blast, killing her instantly. The away team is brought back to the Enterprise but the damage to Yar is too great for Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) to repair, and they are unable to resuscitate her. A second away team is sent to the planet. Armus taunts the crew members and maintains his grasp of <b>the</b> <b>shuttle.</b> During this time, Troi has communicated with Armus and learned that it is a physical manifestation of evil from the bodies of an ancient race, abandoned on Vagra II.|$|E
