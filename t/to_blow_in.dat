5|$|The {{captain of}} a sailing ship seeks a course along which the winds can be {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>in</b> the direction of travel. During the Age of Sail, the pattern of prevailing winds made various points of the globe easy or difficult to access, and therefore had a direct effect on European empire-building and thus on modern political geography. For example, Manila galleons could not sail into the wind at all.|$|E
25|$|The wealthier suburbs west of {{the city}} are located at {{slightly}} higher altitudes, which allows cool breezes <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>in</b> the summer, bringing drier, comfortable nights during hotter periods, and more regular frost in the winter. Generally speaking, Córdoba's daytime temperatures are very slightly warmer than Buenos Aires' but nighttime lows are usually cooler, especially in the winter. This, combined to a lower humidity {{and the possibility of}} fleeing to higher altitudes minutes away from the city centre, makes the climate a bit more comfortable than in the capital.|$|E
500|$|If the Earth were a {{non-rotating}} planet, {{solar heating}} would cause winds across the mid-latitudes <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>in</b> a poleward direction, {{away from the}} subtropical ridge. [...] However, the Coriolis effect caused by the rotation of Earth causes winds to steer {{to the right of}} what would otherwise be expected across the Northern Hemisphere, and left of what would be expected in the Southern Hemisphere. [...] This is why winds across the Northern Hemisphere tend to blow from the southwest, but they tend to be from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere. [...] When pressures are lower over the poles, the strength of the westerlies increases, which has the effect of warming the mid-latitudes. [...] This occurs when the Arctic oscillation is positive, and during winter low pressure near the poles is stronger than it would be during the summer. [...] When it is negative and pressures are higher over the poles, the flow is more meridional, blowing {{from the direction of the}} pole towards the equator, which brings cold air into the mid-latitudes.|$|E

500|$|Of the ten tornadoes in Florida, {{three were}} spawned in the {{southern}} portions of the state. In The Acreage, an EF-1 tornado caused minor to moderate roof damage to several homes, mainly {{in the form of}} shingles and roof covering torn off. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped near the trunk, along with several branches falling; this resulted in broken windows in several homes. At one home, the garage door was damaged, causing the door <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>in,</b> which in turn led to the roof being damaged above the garage. An 85-year-old woman was injured after being struck by a falling branch of an oak tree, which broke through her bedroom window. A few vehicles were moved from their original locations, while a [...] boat was flipped on its side. Another tornado in Belle Glade damaged an awning and downed trees and several power lines. Further south, a tornado touched down in Broward County and entered Palm Beach County before lifting back up; it resulted in no damage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{speed at}} which a fuse blows {{depends on how much}} current flows through it and the {{material}} of which the fuse is made. The operating time is not a fixed interval, but decreases as the current increases. Fuses have different characteristics of operating time compared to current. [...] A standard fuse may require twice its rated current to open in one second, a fast-blow fuse may require twice its rated current <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>in</b> 0.1 seconds, and a slow-blow fuse may require twice its rated current for tens of seconds to blow.|$|E

US President Ronald Reagan said: 'The American people share {{in the loss of}} a voice of wisdom and {{humanity}} who, with eloquence and gentle wit, brought to the problems of today the experience of a long life of public service.' Outlawed African National Congress president Oliver Tambo sent his condolences: 'As South Africans we shall always remember him for his efforts to encourage the apartheid regime to bow to the winds of change that continue <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>in</b> South Africa.' Commonwealth Secretary-General Sir Shridath Ramphal affirmed: 'His own leadership in providing from Britain a worthy response to African national consciousness shaped the post-war era and made the modern Commonwealth possible.' ...|$|E

2500|$|New winds began <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>in</b> the Soviet Union as Mikhail Gorbachev {{took the}} seat of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and GGG {{experienced}} less resistance from authorities. In 1988 they released their only LP entitled Põlemine (Burning). The vinyl was issued by Melodiya, a Soviet record company – {{the only one in the}} whole USSR. Distribution of the record was very high. At the time, GGG consisted of Gunnar Graps (drums, percussion, vocals, keyboards), Juri Stihhanov (lead guitar), Andres Aak (now known as Angela Aak, rhythm guitar), Jüri Roosa (bass guitar) and Tiit Altosaar (drums on some songs, as Graps tended to perform most drumming (along with singing) himself). They performed in Estonia and the rest of the Soviet Union and were very popular until their fade in the end of decade. Their most popular songs were [...] "Põlemine" [...] (Burning), [...] "Valgus" [...] (Light), the ballad [...] "Mosaiik" [...] (Mosaic), [...] "Raudmees" [...] (Iron Man) – a song which gave Graps his nickname.|$|E
2500|$|Rivière {{assaulted}} Nam Định {{the following}} day. [...] He disembarked his force at 11 a.m., after a devastating five-hour bombardment of the citadel by the gunboats. The attack force numbered just under 600 men, as Rivière supported the marine infantry and Cochinchinese riflemen with the landing companies of the gunboats Pluvier and Fanfare. [...] The troops went ashore {{in a suburb}} beyond the city's outer walls {{and were able to}} advance under cover of the buildings until they reached the main defences. [...] In accordance with Rivière's plan, capitaine du génie Dupommier used dynamite charges <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>in</b> the gate of the eastern demilune, then the eastern gate of the citadel. [...] Dupommier and his party of engineers came under heavy fire from the Vietnamese defenders as they advanced to lay their charges, and had to fall back and wait for covering fire before making a second attempt. [...] Once both gates had been blown in, the French charged into the citadel. [...] Rivière led from the front, urging on his troops as they fought their way into the city and setting an example of personal courage. [...] The Vietnamese resisted fiercely, but were overwhelmed by the superior firepower and morale of the French. [...] By late afternoon the city was in French hands and its governor in flight. [...] Sailors from Fanfare and Pluvier reached the summit of the citadel together. [...] Unable to agree on who was first to the top, they hauled down the Annamese flag and hoisted two French flags in its place.|$|E
