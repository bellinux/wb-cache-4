25|$|The {{text of the}} Discourses was {{originally}} published serially as essays dictated by Baba on spiritual subjects, intended for inclusion in a monthly periodical titled Meher Baba Journal. The Journal was edited in India and published in New York, and lasted from Nov. 1938 <b>to</b> <b>Oct.</b> 1942. At {{the end of each}} year of publication, the essays by Baba from the Journal were compiled into a single volume, published in India. These compilation printings, over the period from 1939 to 1943, resulted in a five-volume set of books titled Discourses of Meher Baba. As these went out of print, slightly corrected editions were released of each volume. These printings are now collectively referred to as the 1st - 5th editions of the Discourses.|$|E
