5|$|Candidates for Freemasonry {{will have}} met most active {{members of the}} Lodge they are joining before they are initiated. The process varies between jurisdictions, but the {{candidate}} will typically have been introduced by a friend at a Lodge social function, or at some form of open evening in the Lodge. In modern times, interested people often track down a local Lodge through the Internet. <b>The</b> <b>onus</b> is on candidates to ask to join; while candidates may be encouraged to ask, they are never invited. Once the initial inquiry is made, an interview usually follows to determine the candidate's suitability. If the candidate decides to proceed from here, the Lodge ballots on the application before he (or she, depending on the Masonic Jurisdiction) can be accepted.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian II Corps—commanded by Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds—initially {{assigned}} two infantry {{divisions and}} one armoured brigade to {{the assault on}} the German positions around Verrières. The Canadian 3rd Infantry Division—having taken heavy casualties during the first six weeks of the Normandy campaign—was given a supporting role. <b>The</b> <b>onus</b> of the task therefore fell on the fresh, though relatively inexperienced, Canadian 2nd Infantry Division, along with the tanks of the Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade. Additional forces were later made available in the shape of three divisions from the British I Corps: the 51st (Highland) Division, the Guards Armoured Division, and the British 7th Armoured Division. Despite having significantly more combat experience than their Canadian counterparts, the British units played a minor part in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Florida's {{consideration}} {{of a bill}} to compensate victims of racial violence was the first by any U.S. state. Opponents argued that the bill set a dangerous precedent and put <b>the</b> <b>onus</b> of paying survivors and descendants on Floridians who {{had nothing to do}} with the incident in Rosewood. James Peters, who represented the State of Florida, argued that the statute of limitations applied because the law enforcement officials named in the lawsuit—Sheriff Walker and Governor Hardee—had died many years before. He also called into question the shortcomings of the report: although the historians were instructed not to write it with compensation in mind, they offered conclusions about the actions of Sheriff Walker and Governor Hardee. The report was based on investigations led by historians as opposed to legal experts; they relied in cases on information that was hearsay from witnesses who had since died. Critics thought that some of the report's writers asked leading questions in their interviews.|$|E
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{interrelation}} of deontic operators in contracts – an aspect often neglected when considering {{only one of the}} involved parties. On top of an automata-based semantics we formalise <b>the</b> <b>onuses</b> that obligations, permissions and prohibitions on one party impose on the other. Such formalisation allows for a clean notion of contract strictness and a derived notion of contract conflict that is enriched with issues arising from party interdependence. ...|$|R

5|$|Odex {{blamed the}} {{approximate}} 70% fall in its Video CD (VCD) and Digital Video Disc (DVD) sales in 2006 and 2007 on illegal downloading. The response of anime fans {{was that the}} fall in sales was because Odex's products were inferior, inaccurately translated, and released later than the online versions. Odex subsequently attributed the inaccurate subtitling on censorship laws against mature themes (such as yaoi) and on fansubbers—anime fans who had translated the Japanese dialogue—whom they had hired. In response, the Board of Film Censors said {{that it did not}} ask for subtitles to be changed, that it merely classified content, and that <b>the</b> <b>onus</b> was on distributors to ensure accurate subtitles. In addition to problems of quality and scheduling, criticisms were directed at Odex's litigious strategy and poor public relations. Odex received support from the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore (AVPAS) in making its demands for compensation.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate among}} monks unfolds in the {{presence}} of their teachers, with a very well set rules of procedure for the defender and the questioners. The tradition of such debates is traced to the ancient ‘Hindu Orthodoxy’ in India and this practice permeated into Buddhist orthodoxy in Tibet in the eighth century. Such debates usually take place within the monastery’s precincts. The defender has <b>the</b> <b>onus</b> to prove his point of view on the subject proposed for debate. The debate opens with an invocation to Manjushri recited in a loud and high pitched tone. The roles of the debater and the questioner are well defined; the questioner has to succinctly present his case (all on Buddhism related topics) and the defender has to answer within a fixed time frame. The finality of the debate is with specific answers like: “I accept (do), the reason is not established (ta madrup) or there is no pervasion (Kyappa majung)”. Many a time, the questions mooted are meant to mislead the defender. If the defender does not reply within a time frame, an expression of derision is witnessed. In the Tibetan debating sessions, there is no role for a witness and there is normally no adjudicator. This leads to “conflicting opinions of participants and listeners.” When there is direct contradiction on the defenders part, the outcome is, however, formally decided.|$|E

50|$|Logically, a {{court may}} refuse bail pending appeal {{if it is}} an appeal against the {{sentence}} only. At best for the convicted person, whichever way the appeal goes, he will still end up serving a lengthy period of imprisonment. If a convicted person loses his appeal to the High Court, he may still be released on bail pending an application for leave to appeal or petition to the SCA. Some cases have held that <b>the</b> <b>onuses</b> imposed under section 60(11) of the CPA also apply to bail pending appeal. The correctness of these cases is doubtful.|$|R

50|$|The Court however {{was divided}} {{on whether a}} {{reversal}} of <b>onus</b> onto <b>the</b> accused in s. 37.3(2) was constitutional. The majority (Lamer with LaForest, Sopinka, Gonthier, McLachlin, Stevenson, and Iacobucci) held that <b>the</b> reverse <b>onus</b> infringed s.11(d) of the Charter. However, only four of the seven held {{that it could not}} be saved under s. 1. Since the remaining 2 judges (L'Heureux-Dube and Cory) found <b>the</b> reversal of <b>onus</b> did not violate s. 11(d), a majority was had by those that argued a reversal of onus was constitutionally justifiable by a 5 to 4 margin.|$|R

50|$|The Court was {{unanimous}} in holding that <b>the</b> shift in <b>onus</b> violated both Oakes's section 11(d) rights and indirectly his section 7 rights, {{and could not}} be justified under section 1 of the charter. This was because there was no rational connection between basic possession and the presumption of trafficking, and therefore <b>the</b> shift in <b>onus</b> is not related to the previous challenge to section 11(d) of the charter.|$|R
50|$|Initially, the {{plaintiff}} need not prove anything; he may prima facie discharge <b>the</b> primary <b>onus</b> by <b>the</b> mere averment in the summons that {{the plaintiff}} is the holder of a liquid document bearing the defendant's signature {{or that of}} an authorised agent of the defendant.|$|R
25|$|The {{aim of the}} {{creditor}} in such an application is, as a rule, to obtain payment of a debt, or at least part payment. <b>The</b> <b>onus</b> of satisfying the court of these three matters rests on the sequestrating creditor: There is no onus on the debtor to disprove any element.|$|E
25|$|The debtor has {{to prove}} that {{sequestration}} will be {{to the advantage of}} creditors, whereas, in an application for compulsory sequestration, the creditor has to show merely that {{there is reason to believe}} that it will be. <b>The</b> <b>onus,</b> then, is more strenuous in the case of voluntary surrender than in the case of compulsory sequestration.|$|E
25|$|Brad Evans and Julian Reid criticize {{resilience}} {{discourse and}} its rising popularity in their book, Resilient Life. The authors assert that policies of resilience can put <b>the</b> <b>onus</b> of disaster response on individuals rather than publicly coordinated efforts. Tied {{to the emergence}} of neoliberalism, climate change theory, third-world development, and other discourses, Evans and Reid argue that promoting resilience draws attention away from governmental responsibility and towards localized, laissez-faire responses.|$|E

25|$|More worrisome {{for human}} rights and women's rights advocates, lawyers and {{politicians}} was the incarceration of thousands of rape victims on charges of zina. <b>The</b> <b>onus</b> of providing proof in a rape case rests with the woman herself. Uncorroborated testimony by women was inadmissible in hudood crimes. If the victim/accuser was unable to prove her allegation, bringing the case to court was considered equivalent to a confession of sexual intercourse outside of lawful marriage. Despite this the ordinance remained in force until the Women's Protection Bill was passed in 2006.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union invaded Eastern Poland on September 17, {{its path}} cleared {{by the lack}} of British and French {{military}} activity against the Nazis in Western Poland. It wanted to build a cordon against German military strength west of the Soviet Union's national border. The Stalin regime went further, however, making its nonaggression pact into a de facto Friendship Pact by signing a joint statement with the Germans characterizing the partition of Poland as a fait accompli, calling for an end to hostilities, and placing <b>the</b> <b>onus</b> for any escalation of the European conflict on the governments of Great Britain and France.|$|E
25|$|The Witnesses' {{judicial}} process {{has also been}} criticized. Hearings take place in secret, with judicial committees filling the roles of judge, jury and prosecutor. According to Franz, witnesses may present evidence but {{are not permitted to}} remain for the discussion. Critics Heather and Gary Botting have claimed that Witnesses accused of an offence warranting expulsion are presumed guilty until found innocent. They say <b>the</b> <b>onus</b> is on the accused to prove their innocence and if they make no attempt to do so—by failing to appear at a hearing set by the judicial committee—they are assumed to be guilty and unrepentant.|$|E
50|$|Oakes made {{a charter}} challenge, {{claiming}} that <b>the</b> reverse <b>onus</b> created by <b>the</b> presumption of possession {{for purposes of}} trafficking violated {{the presumption of innocence}} guarantee under section 11(d) of the Charter.
