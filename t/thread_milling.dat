40|$|Now the {{mechanical}} engineering industry produces {{a great variety of}} part mix having a male and female thread. In this regard a relevant task is to choose the most effective way of threading. Introduction of multi-coordinate CNC machines considerably extended the use of <b>thread</b> <b>mills,</b> instead of taps, roll burnishers, dies and thread turning tools. The article reviews manufacturer’s production programs of <b>thread</b> <b>mills</b> (Carmex, Emuge, Jel, Sandvik, Vargus) to show that, presently, there is a significant diversity of <b>thread</b> <b>mill</b> designs for processing. The analysis allowed to reveal the main nomenclature and standard sizes of <b>thread</b> <b>mills,</b> including combined tools on their base, as well as to reveal classification signs and to develop classification of <b>thread</b> <b>mills.</b> Classification comprises also combined tools based on design of <b>thread</b> <b>mill,</b> which allow us to reduce the nomenclature of the tools used in threading. The paper considers working schemes of the main types of <b>thread</b> <b>mills</b> and areas of their rational application. To analyse design data of <b>thread</b> <b>mills</b> two types of tools have been selected, namely the integral trailer edge <b>thread</b> <b>mills</b> with the spiral chip flutes and drill <b>thread</b> <b>mills</b> made from hard alloy. The analysis of design data was made in the closed "system of the tool", i. e. in advance assuming that there is a connection between diameter of the tapping part of the tool and diameter of the cut thread. The parameter analysis of the chosen designs allowed us to develop the sketches of tools with the specified parameters to be calculated. The paper presents graphic dependences of the total length, length of a working part, diameter of a tail part and number of tool teeth on the diameter of the working part of the tool. Approximation of the specified parameters is carried out and mathematical dependences, which can be further used to calculate and choose the starting values of design data in designing the abovementioned constructions of <b>thread</b> <b>mills.</b> </p...|$|R

2500|$|Another {{variant of}} form-milling {{involves}} holding the cutter's axis orthogonally (no canting to the thread's helix angle) and feeding the cutter in a toolpath that will generate the thread. The part {{is usually a}} stationary workpiece, such as a boss on a valve body (in external <b>thread</b> <b>milling)</b> or a hole in a plate or block (in internal <b>thread</b> <b>milling).</b> This type of <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> uses essentially the same concept as contouring with an endmill or ball-nose mill, but the cutter and toolpath are arranged specifically to define the [...] "contour" [...] of a thread. The toolpath is achieved either using helical interpolation (which is circular interpolation in one plane [...] with simultaneous linear interpolation along a third axis the CNC control model must be one that supports using the third axis) or a simulation of it using extremely small increments of 3-axes linear interpolation (which is not practical to program manually but can be programmed easily with CAD/CAM software). The cutter geometry reflects the thread pitch but not its lead; the lead (thread helix angle) {{is determined by the}} toolpath. Tapered threads can be cut either with a tapered multiple-form cutter that completes the thread in one revolution using helical interpolation, or with a straight or tapered cutter (of single- or multiple-form) whose toolpath is one or more revolutions but cannot use helical interpolation and must use CAD/CAM software to generate a contour-like simulation of helical interpolation.|$|E
2500|$|The tooling {{used for}} <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> can be solid or indexable. For {{internal}} threads, solid cutters are generally limited to holes larger than , and indexable internal thread cutting tools {{are limited to}} holes larger than [...] The advantage {{is that when the}} insert wears out it is easily and more cost effectively replaced. The disadvantage is the cycle time is generally longer than solid tools. Note that solid multiple-form thread cutting tools look similar to taps, but they differ in that the cutting tool does not have a backtaper and there is not a lead-in chamfer. This lack of a lead-in chamfer allows the threads to be formed within one pitch length of the bottom of a blind hole.|$|E
2500|$|Threads may be milled with a {{rotating}} milling cutter if the correct helical toolpath can be arranged. This was formerly arranged mechanically, {{and it was}} suitable for mass-production work although uncommon in job-shop work. With the widespread dissemination of affordable, fast, precise CNC, it became much more common, and today internal and external threads are often milled even on work where they would formerly have been cut with taps, die heads, or single-pointing. Some advantages of <b>thread</b> <b>milling,</b> as compared to single-point cutting or taps and dies, are faster cycle times, less tool breakage, and that a left- or right-hand thread can be created with the same tool. Additionally, for large, awkward workpieces (such as a fire hydrant casting), it is simply easier to let the workpiece sit stationary on a table while all needed machining operations are performed on it with rotating tools, as opposed to rigging it up for rotation around the axis of each set of threads (that is, for the [...] "arms" [...] and [...] "mouth" [...] of the hydrant).|$|E
