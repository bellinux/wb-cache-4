5|$|The High Court of Chivalry or the Earl Marshal's Court is a {{specialised}} {{civil court}} in England, {{presided over by}} the Earl Marshal. The first references made about the court was in 1348. The court has jurisdiction over all matters relating to heraldry as it legalises and enforce decisions of the College of Arms. The court considers all cases relating <b>to</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> status, including disputes over social rank and the law of arms, for example complaints on the infringement {{of the use of}} another individual's coat of arms. The Court of Chivalry meets on the premises of the College of Arms, however the last time it met was in 1954, the first time in 230 years.|$|E
5|$|Iginla {{continued}} {{his pursuit of}} Fleury's franchise record of 830points in 2008–09. He recorded his 800th point with a first period assist against the Chicago Blackhawks on December 19, 2008. He ended 2008 with a career high five points in a New Year's Eve game against the Edmonton Oilers. He had 14 previous four point games. In January, he {{was named to the}} 2009 NHL All-Star Game in Montreal, his fifth such selection. Representing the Western Conference, Iginla scored his first career NHL All-Star Game goal in a 12–11 shootout loss. He passed Fleury as the Flames' all-time scoring leader on March 1, 2009, by recording five points, including his 400th career goal, in an 8–6 loss to the Lightning. He finished the season with 35goals and 89points, but a disappointing playoff performance led <b>to</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> whether he had been playing with an injury. Iginla quickly denied the rumour, admitted that he had not played with the level of consistency he expected and stated that he would spend the summer focused on improving his play in 2009–10.|$|E

5|$|Influenced by Keynes, {{economics}} {{texts in}} the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade. For example, the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, An Outline of Money, devoted the last three of its ten chapters <b>to</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> foreign exchange management {{and in particular the}} 'problem of balance'. However, in more recent years, {{since the end of the}} Bretton Woods system in 1971, with the increasing influence of Monetarist schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns – and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses – have largely disappeared from mainstream economics discourse and Keynes' insights have slipped from view. They are receiving some attention again in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–08.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{also found}} time to {{contribute}} to the administration of the wider university, serving on the Hebdomadal Council, as a Delegate of Oxford University Press, as one of the curators of the Bodleian, and as Pro-Vice-Chancellor 1974–5. It was during this period that he began to participate in the discussions of the Anglican–Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC); {{he was a member of}} the commission 1969–81 and again 1983–90. his early Evangelical sympathies having been tempered over time, helped by his friendship with Edward Yarnold, Master of Campion Hall. He was a master of the Anglican approach of producing statements capable of a range of interpretations to enable common ground to be reached, this worked well for simpler historical differences, but did not always impress the Roman Catholic members of the commission when it came <b>to</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> ecclesiology and church authority. He was also able to use his historical background to put forward summaries of early church positions on a variety of subjects, and he had a true desire to establish consensus on the basis of the principles revealed by this research. Although his scholarly output suffered from the pressures on his time, he was editor of Oxford Early Christian Texts (from 1970), and was able to work on two major monographs, Priscillian of Avila: the occult and the charismatic in the early Church (published 1976) and Boethius: the consolations of music, logic, theology and philosophy (published 1981). The second of these in particular allowing him to draw on the full range of his interests.|$|E

25|$|The Talmud is {{a wide-ranging}} {{document}} that touches {{on a great}} many subjects. Traditionally Talmudic statements are classified into two broad categories, halakhic and aggadic statements.

Aggadic statements are not legally related, but rather are exegetical, homiletical, ethical, or historical in nature.|$|E

25|$|This {{theory has}} been {{developed}} with great attention to local analysis, leading {{to the definition of}} the Tate-Shafarevich group.

25|$|Hodge's {{literary}} {{powers were}} seen {{at their best}} in his contributions to the Princeton Theological Review, {{many of which are}} acknowledged masterpieces of controversial writing.

But the questions in debate among American theologians during the period covered by Hodge's life belonged, for the most part, to the departments of anthropology and soteriology; and it was upon these, accordingly, that his polemic powers were mainly applied.|$|E

25|$|In August 2016, the Daily Mail began a {{partnership}} with The People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party. This includes publishing articles in the MailOnline produced by The People's Daily. The agreement has been suggested to give the paper an edge in publishing news stories sourced out of China, but also led <b>to</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> censorship regarding politically sensitive topics. In November 2016 Lego ended a series of promotions in the paper which had run for years following campaigning from a group called 'Stop Funding Hate', who were unhappy with the Mails coverage of migrant issues and the EU referendum.|$|E

Further Chinese immigration was limited and then banned by a series of restrictive and racially motivated dominion statutes. The Komagata Maru incident in 1914 revealed overt hostility towards would-be immigrants, mainly Sikhs from India, who attempted to land in Vancouver.|$|E
