5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} and other executive function skills {{are crucial to}} success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found that children who received such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who were randomly assigned to <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E
25|$|A {{functional}} analysis {{is the most}} direct form of functional behavior assessment, in which specific antecedents and consequences are systematically manipulated to test their separate effects {{on the behavior of}} interest. Each manipulation of the antecedent and consequence in a particular situation is referred to a condition. In a {{functional analysis}}, conditions are typically alternated between quite rapidly independent of responding to test the different functions of behavior. When data paths are elevated above <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> (described below) {{it can be said that}} there is a functional relation between that condition and the behavior of interest. Complexity, time restraints, and setting restraints, are a few limitations to this particular method. When deciding to use this method, it should be noted that there is a chance of high-risk behavior and the possibility of low-rate behaviors.|$|E
25|$|In this condition, {{the child}} is allowed to engage {{with a variety of}} items during the session. No demands are placed on the child {{throughout}} the duration of the session. The experimenter provides attention to the individual throughout the session on any behavior that is not the target behavior. If the target behavior occurs, the experimenter removes attention until the behavior has subsided. This session is meant to act as a control condition, meaning that the environment is enriched for the purpose of the behavior not occurring. Said another way, by meeting environmental needs for all possible functions, the individual is not likely to engage in the behavior of interest. This condition is used as a comparison to the other conditions. Any condition that is elevated to a large degree form <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>condition,</b> shows a higher degree experimental control indicating the functional relationship between the specific environmental conditions and the behavior of interest.|$|E

He made up product names for a DVD that matched both {{part of the}} participant's name {{and his or her}} birthday. For example, a participant named Mariëlle, born on 14 May would get an ad for a DVD-player named [...] "DVD-Ma 14" [...] in the self-relevant condition and [...] "DVD-Pu 30" [...] in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>condition.</b> He found that high self-esteem participants liked products more if the product names were self-relevant than if they were not. He also found the opposite happened among low self-esteem participants: they liked products better if they were not self-relevant.|$|E
500|$|Jones, Pelham, Carvallo and Mirenberg {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} number preference on interpersonal attraction. In a lab study they showed US participants text profiles of people. The profiles came with a prominently displayed, seemingly arbitrary code that was explained as merely to help the researchers {{keep track of the}} profiles. One half of the participants were shown a code that matched their birthday (e.g. someone born on 8 September saw a partner profile with the code [...] "09-08"); the other half a non-matching code (e.g. [...] "03-23"). All participants were shown exactly the same profile. They had to rate how much they thought they would like the person in the profile. The results showed that participants liked the profiles significantly more when the code matched their own birthday numbers. Relative to participants in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>condition,</b> participants in the birthday-association condition could {{at the end of the}} test more accurately recall the code, but only 5 of 110 participants mentioned the matching code as a potential influence. Jones et al. concluded that people’s preferences for their own birthday numbers are potent enough to influence people’s attraction to other people. Pelham and Carvallo subsequently looked at interpersonal attraction using field data. They used statewide marriage records to conclude that people disproportionately marry people who share their birthday numbers. They also found that brides disproportionately chose their own birthday numbers and birth months as wedding dates.|$|E

2500|$|Irwin's early {{experiments}} tested participants {{ability to}} identify random dot patterns as the same, or as different across saccades. <b>The</b> <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> for this experiment presented dot patterns in the same spatial location without saccades, meaning participants had a single fixation point. [...] A no-overlap control condition presented dot patterns in different spatial locations, while participants maintained fixation on one point. This tested the ability of visual short-term memory in identifying two individual patterns. The experimental condition showed dot patterns in the same spatial location but were viewed at separate fixations, forcing the use of transsaccadic memory. For the experimental condition, participants underwent a calibration phase, where they were shown five points in separate location to fixate on individually, for less than two seconds. The next phase presented a single fixation point for less than two seconds, which {{was followed by a}} random dot pattern presented in a different location, acting as a saccade target. The dot pattern disappeared when the saccade was initiated. Another dot pattern then appeared in the same location. Participants had to identify whether the two patterns were the same or different.|$|E

50|$|The study {{conducted}} by Johnson and Scott (1976) {{represents one of the}} few simulation studies available, likely due to the ethical issues surrounding the exposure of research participants to a putatively threatening scenario. For this reason much of the research conducted on the weapon focus effect has made use of videos or slide shows. In one of the first such experiments, Loftus, Loftus and Messo (1987) had participants watch a video in which a young man approached the counter of a fast food restaurant, presented an object to the cashier, accepted money and left. In <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> the man presented a cheque to the cashier whereas in the weapon condition the man presented a gun. Specialized equipment tracked the participant's gaze as they viewed the video to determine with what frequency (and for how long) they fixated upon the item of interest (the cheque or the gun). Relative to <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>condition,</b> participants in the weapon condition looked at the item the man was holding more frequently and for greater duration. Further, when tested for the details of the event, performance was better for <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> relative to the weapon condition - with the exception that participants in the weapon condition were more likely to recall what object the man was holding (a gun).|$|E
