The act that was signed by President Harry S.

25|$|In poetry, {{the early}} 18th century was {{an age of}} satire and public verse, and in prose, it was an age of the {{developing}} novel. In drama, by contrast, it was an age in transition between the highly witty and sexually playful Restoration comedy, the pathetic she-tragedy of {{the turn of the}} 18th century, and any later plots of middle-class anxiety. The Augustan stage retreated from the Restoration's focus on cuckoldry, marriage for fortune, and a life of leisure. Instead, Augustan drama reflected questions the mercantile class had about itself and {{what it meant to be}} gentry: what it meant to be a good merchant, how to achieve wealth with morality, and <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> those who serve.|$|E

He concluded that the Vietnam War had actually been lost in Washington, D.C., before any fighting occurred, due to a fundamental failure {{on the part of the}} civilian and military actors involved to argue the issues adequately. McMaster, who urged a more direct debate between civilians and the military on defense policy and actions, and Summers, who argued for a clear separation between civilians and the military, both pointed out controversies over <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> civilian and military leaders.|$|R

Here we consider examples of the arguments and counter- arguments that have shaped this discussion.

25|$|Because the Pill was so effective, {{and soon}} so widespread, it also {{heightened}} {{the debate about}} the moral and health consequences of pre-marital sex and promiscuity. Never before had sexual activity been so divorced from reproduction. For a couple using the Pill, intercourse became purely an expression of love, or a means of physical pleasure, or both; but it was no longer a means of reproduction. While this was true of previous contraceptives, their relatively high failure rates and their less widespread use failed to emphasize this distinction as clearly as did the Pill. The spread of oral contraceptive use thus led many religious figures and institutions to debate <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> sexuality and its relationship to procreation. The Roman Catholic Church in particular, after studying the phenomenon of oral contraceptives, re-emphasized the stated teaching on birth control in the 1968 papal encyclical Humanae vitae. The encyclical reiterated the established Catholic teaching that artificial contraception distorts the nature and purpose of sex. On the other side Anglican and other Protestant churches, such as the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) accepted the combined oral contraceptive pill.|$|E

[...] Barbauld took this opportunity to write a sermon, Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation, on the moral responsibility of the individual; for her, each individual {{is responsible for the}} actions of the nation because he or she constitutes part of the nation. The essay attempts to determine what <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the individual is in the state and while she argues that [...] "insubordination" [...] can undermine a government, she does admit that there are lines of [...] "conscience" [...] that one cannot cross in obeying a government.

500|$|Wisemore is not {{the only}} one to serve as a means to comment on society; the {{characters}} Vermilia and Lady Matchless are used to discuss <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> females within society by serving as housewives. The dialogue between the two reveals that females are only in control of the domestic sphere because men have allowed them to dominate in the area. This is not to suggest that Fielding supports the repression of females; instead, women are used as a way to discuss the internal aspects of humans including both emotions and morality. However, feminist critic Jill Campbell points out that Fielding does mock women who abuse their relationship with the internal, emotions, and morality in order to dominate and assume power. Tiffany Potter, another feminist critic, sees gender within the play in a different light; Merital's actions and words show a moderate approach to females, and [...] "Women are neither victims of deceitful men nor overdefensive virgins, but individuals who can choose to 'bestow' their favours on a man who will 'enjoy' them." ...|$|E

He held that within each person is an innate potentiality (his daimon, or soul), and that each persons life task is to discover it and actualize it.

Despite her apparent adherence to Pythagoreanism, a school whose theorists (the canonici) put music on a rational and mathematical basis, there is no apparent hostility in her citations of the empiricist followers of Aristoxenus (the musici); perhaps the methodological division was not a stark absolute during her period or from her point of view.

2500|$|Opponents, such as Henry Kissinger, who {{was himself}} {{the subject of}} war crimes charges in Spain, argue that {{universal}} jurisdiction is a breach of each state's sovereignty: all states being equal in sovereignty, as affirmed by the United Nations Charter, [...] "idespread agreement that human rights violations and crimes against humanity must be prosecuted has hindered active consideration of <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> international courts.

40|$|After World War II, {{psychological}} {{experts and}} popular commentators urged American women to embrace domesticity to better ease veterans’ readjustment to civilian society. Historians have interpreted such prescriptive literature {{as part of}} a larger push to reverse women’s wartime gains and re-establish traditional gender roles after the war’s social disruptions. This essay argues for a more nuanced interpretation by emphasizing how messages directed toward women differed radically according to age and life stage. Whereas young girlfriends and wives were urged to act as supportive helpmates by adopting a therapeutic stance toward returning boyfriends and husbands, middle-aged mothers were admonished to not be overly solicitous when dealing with their sons. Youthful heterosexual romance was depicted as an antidote to excessive mother-son intimacy, which was widely associated with dependency, immaturity and homosexuality.

2500|$|Politicians {{sponsored}} {{many small}} newspapers, which provided {{an outlet for}} numerous writers to debate economic questions and promote their particular reforms. Known as the [...] "Generation of the 70s" [...] the writers focused on political economy, and how the traditional economy could be stimulated to [...] progress and growth. Important writers included [...] Antero de Quental, who wrote abstract [...] philosophical essays; Joaquim P. Oliveira Martins (1845-94), who focused on financial topics; José Maria Eça de Queiroz (1845-1900), who employed realism and irony in his fiction to make points in political economy; and Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro [...] with his biting caricatures of pompous politicians. [...] Writers often considered the dilemmas caused by [...] economic growth and material progress in France and Britain. Socialism appealed only to Quental, who was {{a founder of the}} Partido Socialista Português (Portuguese Socialist Party). They did concern themselves with the political consequences of rich powerbrokers, the threat of [...] depopulation in rural areas, the worsening of urban poverty. They dealt with issues of social injustice, worker unrest, and <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the state in promoting the public welfare.|$|E
2500|$|Increased {{commercial}} activity produced {{a high degree}} of normative ambiguity, especially in areas like central Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces, where rural economic growth was fastest. Neither <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> local officials nor the rights and obligations of new entrepreneurs or traders were clear. The line between the normal use of personal contacts and hospitality and extraordinary and criminal favoritism and corruption was ambiguous. There were hints of the development of a system of patron-client ties, in which administrative cadres granted favors to ordinary farmers in return for support, esteem, and an occasional gift. The increased number of corruption cases reported in the Chinese press and the widespread assumption that the decollectivization and rural economic reforms had led to growing corruption probably reflected both the increased opportunities for deals and favors of all sorts and the ambiguous nature of many of the transactions and relationships. The party's repeated calls for improved [...] "socialist spiritual civilization" [...] and the attempts of the central authorities both to create a system of civil law and to foster respect for it can be interpreted as responses to the problem. On the local level, where cadres and entrepreneurs were engaged in constant negotiation on the rules of their game, the problem was presumably being addressed in a more straightforward fashion.|$|E
2500|$|The Democrats {{represented}} {{a wide range}} of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the Jeffersonian concept of an agrarian society. They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 [...] "corrupt bargain" [...] had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics....Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual--the artisan and the ordinary farmer--by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of paper currency, which they distrusted. Their definition of <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like educational reform mid the establishment of a public education system. They believed, for instance, that public schools restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined freedom of religion by replacing church schools. Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for American Indians, initiating the removal of the Cherokees along the Trail of Tears.|$|E
