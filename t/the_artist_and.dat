50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Artists</b> <b>and</b> Writers Ball did not {{originally}} {{start from}} these Halloween Parties, but started as an underground alternative to Gasparilla. <b>The</b> <b>Artists</b> <b>and</b> Writers Group (Bud Lee, Peggy Lee, David Audet, Paul Wilborn, Beverly Coe and Bebe Williams) was the impetus behind <b>The</b> <b>Artists</b> <b>and</b> Writers Ball. It was traditionally held in early February {{around the time}} of Gasparilla.|$|R

5|$|Homosexual {{interpretations of}} Batman have {{continued}} into the 21st century. One notable example occurred in 2000, when DC Comics refused permission for the reprinting of four panels (from Batman #79, 92, 105, and 139) to illustrate Christopher York's paper All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s. In summer 2005, painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolours depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses. DC threatened both <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>and</b> the Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts gallery with legal action {{if they did not}} cease selling the works and demanded the surrender of all remaining art, as well as any profits derived from them.|$|E
5|$|In 1513, Gasparem de Cayrano de Mediolano lapicida architectum et ingeniarum optimum {{signed the}} {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} a new entrance to the Duomo of Chiari. The document, a reconfirmation of an earlier negotiation, shows that <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>and</b> the municipality had agreed terms two years earlier, but the plans hadn't been executed because of the war in the Brescia area. The contract provided for the fulfilment of the entire project - from the architectural parts to the figurative sculptures, including a group with the Madonna between the Saints Faustino and Giovita. These are now missing, so it's impossible to assess the evolution of Cairano's art after the completion of the ark of Sant'Appollonio. The rest of the work, moreover, again raise questions about the architectural skills of the artist that are still unanswered.|$|E
5|$|In the new magazine's {{first year}} Reed {{was a regular}} {{contributor}} of articles and stories {{on a range of}} subjects, joining distinguished writers such as G. A. Henty, R.M. Ballantyne and Jules Verne. A prominent illustrator for the magazine was <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>and</b> mountaineer Edward Whymper. Reed's association with the B.O.P. lasted for the remainder of his life; the magazine would be the initial publisher for almost all his subsequent output of fiction. This commitment to the B.O.P. delayed progress on his History of the Old English Letter Foundries, especially as Reed began writing regular columns and book reviews for the Leeds Mercury, now edited by his cousin, the younger Edward Baines.|$|E

5|$|Tamagnino {{is known}} to have left Brescia while the {{construction}} of the sanctuary was ongoing, evidently finding his work undervalued and underpaid. The reasons for the bias are unclear, but it is possible that Cairano enjoyed local favour, especially from the directors of the company commissioning the shrine, which allowed him to prevail over Tamagnino despite the latter's technical superiority. Tamagnino then won the prestigious contract for the façade of the Certosa of Pavia, to be installed under the aegis of Father Amedeo and Antonio Mantegazza. The corporate pact between <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>and</b> the two sculptors strengthened in May 1492, providing Tamagnino with a unique training experience as well as a remarkable leap in his career.|$|E
5|$|The Austrian {{national}} broadcaster, Österreichischer Rundfunk (ORF), broadcasts {{the event}} within Austria and organises {{the selection process}} for the nation's entry.

5|$|The {{reason for}} Szigeti's appeal to composers was {{articulated}} by Bloch {{upon completion of}} his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere {{would have to be}} delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the glorification of <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>and</b> his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music.|$|E

5|$|Wohlwend {{began to}} {{collaborate}} with Asher Vollmer when Vollmer reached out to Wohlwend for aesthetic advice on a game he was designing, Puzzlejuice. The game {{has been compared to}} a cross between Boggle, Tetris, and tile-matching, where tetromino blocks fall {{from the top of the}} screen that players turn into letters and rearrange into words. Wohlwend and Vollmer communicated nonverbally through the entire development process via a 365-message email chain. Vollmer served as the game's programmer, Wohlwend as <b>the</b> <b>artist,</b> <b>and</b> Jimmy Hinson as the composer. Puzzlejuice was selected for the PAX 10, a spotlighted group of indie games, in July 2012. It was released as a universal app for iPhone and iPad on January 19, 2012.|$|E
5|$|From 20 to 24 February, Gočeva held five concerts at the Macedonian Opera and Ballet (MOB) {{during which}} she {{performed}} songs from Makedonsko Devojče 2 live for the first time. The concertgoers {{were the first to}} receive copies of the album along with their tickets which were put on sale on 9 December 2013. In 2014, 15,000 tickets were sold for Gočeva's concerts in Skopje. In January 2014, a listening party for the album was held at the club XO in Skopje on which Gočeva was also present; the event represented the first of such kind in Macedonia and according to Gočeva, the inspiration for it came from a similar trend popular across the world where <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>and</b> the team working behind the album listen to the full final version of the project together with a group of fans and music journalists.|$|E
5|$|Krøyer's {{paintings}} of Marie between 1888 and 1906 present {{a record of}} the years they spent together. They show some of their most enjoyable times but also hint at the marital tension that increased as time went by. Among the most notable {{paintings of}} her are Summer Evening at Skagen. The Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore (1892), one of Denmark's most popular works, which shows Marie on the beach with their dog and with the moonlight reflected in the sea, Roses (1893), which depicts her relaxing in the garden, and Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – <b>The</b> <b>Artist</b> <b>and</b> his Wife (1899). Also of note are the depictions of Marie on holiday in Ravello on the Amalfi Coast of Italy in 1890; the portrait for the frieze in the dining room at Skagen's Brøndums Hotel; Chez Moi, a series of watercolours of Marie and the couple's daughter Vibeke in the family homes in Copenhagen and Skagen; and Midsummer Eve Bonfire on Skagen Beach, his last painting of her in which she is shown captured in the firelight with Alfvén.|$|E

5|$|The {{shift in}} attitudes to a romantic {{view of the}} Highlands {{at the end of}} the 18th century had a major impact on Scottish art. Romantic depictions can be seen in the work of 18th-century artists {{including}} Jacob More, and Alexander Runciman. and the next generation of artists, including the portraits of Henry Raeburn (1756–1823), and the landscapes of Alexander Nasmyth (1758–1840) and John Knox (1778–1845). The Royal Scottish Academy of Art was created in 1826, allowing professional painters to more easily exhibit and sell their works. Andrew Geddes (1783–1844) and David Wilkie (1785–1841) were among the most successful portrait painters. The tradition of highland landscape painting was continued by figures such as Horatio McCulloch (1806–67), Joseph Farquharson (1846–1935) and William McTaggart (1835–1910). Aberdeen born William Dyce (1806–64), emerged as one of the most significant figures in art education in the United Kingdom. The Glasgow School, which developed in the late 19th century, and flourished in the early 20th century, produced a distinctive blend of influences including the Celtic Revival the Arts and Crafts Movement, and Japonisme, which found favour throughout the modern art world of continental Europe and helped define the Art Nouveau style. Among the most prominent members were the loose collective of The Four: acclaimed architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh, his wife the painter and glass artist Margaret MacDonald, her sister the artist Frances, and her husband, <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>and</b> teacher Herbert MacNair.|$|E
