25|$|Efforts to {{calm the}} crowd were made by Azerbaijani figures such as {{secretary}} of the city party committee Bayramova and poet Bakhtiyar Vahabzadeh, who addressed the crowd atop a platform. V. Huseinov, the director of the Institute of Political Education in Azerbaijan, also attempted {{to calm the}}m by assuring them that Karabakh would remain within the republic and that the refugees stories were false. He in turn was heckled with insults and forced to step down. Jahangir Muslimzade, Sumgait's first secretary, spoke to the crowd, and told them to allow Armenians to leave of their own accord. But according to witnesses, this message served to agitate the crowd. Shortly after his speech, at around 6:30 pm, Muslimzade was handed a flag of the Azerbaijan SSR and soon found himself leading the crowd. According to Muslimzade, he was attempting to lead the crowd away from the Armenian district and <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea,</b> but many Armenians saw this act as implicating him as a leader of the riot. The crowd, in any case, dispersed and several groups made for the Armenian district.|$|E

500|$|Several {{recurring}} musical motives can {{be heard}} in Takemitsu's works. In particular the pitch motive E♭-E-A {{can be heard}} in many of his later works, whose titles refer to water in some form (<b>Toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea,</b> 1981; Rain Tree Sketch, 1982; I Hear the Water Dreaming, 1987). [...] When spelt in German (Es-E-A), the motive {{can be seen as a}} musical [...] "transliteration" [...] of the word [...] "sea". Takemitsu used this motive (usually transposed) to indicate the presence of water in his [...] "musical landscapes", even in works whose titles do not directly refer to water, such as A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden (1977; see ex. 5).|$|E
500|$|The medium {{half-life}} of 227Ac (21.77 years) {{makes it}} very convenient radioactive isotope in modeling the slow vertical mixing of oceanic waters. The associated processes cannot be studied with the required accuracy by direct measurements of current velocities (of the order 50 meters per year). However, evaluation of the concentration depth-profiles for different isotopes allows estimating the mixing rates. The physics behind this method is as follows: oceanic waters contain homogeneously dispersed 235U. Its decay product, 231Pa, gradually precipitates to the bottom, so that its concentration first increases with depth and then stays nearly constant. 231Pa decays to 227Ac; however, the concentration of the latter isotope does not follow the 231Pa depth profile, but instead increases <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> bottom. This occurs because of the mixing processes which raise some additional 227Ac from the sea bottom. Thus analysis of both 231Pa and 227Ac depth profiles allows to model the mixing behavior.Ac in deep ocean water |journal=Nature |volume=310 |pages=486–488 |date=1984 |doi=10.1038/310486a0 | issue=5977 | bibcode = 1984Natur.310..486N}} ...|$|E

500|$|Takemitsu's words here {{highlight}} his changing stylistic trends {{from the}} late 1970s into the 1980s, which {{have been described as}} [...] "an increased use of diatonic material [...] references to tertian harmony and jazz voicing", which do not, however, project a sense of [...] "large-scale tonality". Many of the works from this period have titles that include a reference to water: <b>Toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> (1981), Rain Tree and Rain Coming (1982), riverrun and I Hear the Water Dreaming (1987). Takemitsu wrote in his notes for the score of Rain Coming that [...] "... the complete collection [...] entitled [...] "Waterscape" ... it was the composer's intention to create a series of works, which like their subject, pass through various metamorphoses, culminating in a sea of tonality." [...] Throughout these works, the S-E-A motive (discussed further below) features prominently, and points to an increased emphasis on the melodic element in Takemitsu's music that began during this later period.|$|E
500|$|The Australian {{submarine}} [...] (Lieutenant Commander Henry Stoker) {{penetrated the}} Straits {{on the night}} of 24/25 April. As landings began at Cape Helles and Anzac Cove at dawn on 25 April, AE2 reached Chanak by [...] and torpedoed a Turkish gunboat believed to be a Peyk-i Şevket-class cruiser and evaded a destroyer. The submarine ran aground beneath a Turkish fort but the Ottoman gunners could not bring their guns to bear and AE2 was manoeuvred free. Shortly after refloating, the periscope was sighted by a Turkish battleship firing over the peninsula at Allied landing sites and the ship ceased fire and withdrew.

At around , AE2 surfaced to recharge batteries and sent a wireless report to the fleet. The landing at Cape Helles was going well but the landing at Anzac Cove was not as successful and the Anzac commander, Lieutenant General Sir William Birdwood, contemplated the re-embarkation of his troops. The success of AE2 was a consideration in Birdwood deciding to persist and reports about AE2 were relayed to the soldiers ashore to improve morale. Stoker was ordered to [...] "generally run amok" [...] and with no enemies in sight, he sailed into the Sea of Marmara, where AE2 cruised for five days to give the impression of greater numbers and made several attacks against Ottoman ships, which failed because of mechanical problems with the torpedoes.|$|E

Doviculus {{is aware of the}} presence of his spy [...] "Succoria" [...] by the smell of her blood as it was at the Temple; Eddie and his allies come to believe Ophelia is Doviculus' spy. Lars leaves his hiding spot to face Doviculus, but is quickly killed. As the Tainted Coil destroy the tower, Ironheade escapes into the nearby mountains; Eddie is forced to leave with Lita leaving Ophelia behind despite their shared love. Heartbroken, Ophelia is drawn <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> of Black Tears, cursed waters that grant humans supernatural abilities at the cost of humanity. After leaping into the black waters, the Sea creates a dark doppelganger of Ophelia, who raises an army of other Black Tear-corrupted humans, the goth [...] "Drowning Doom". After three months, she leads an attack on Ironheade's mountain camp. Though Ironheade defeats the assault, Eddie determines they must destroy the Sea to end her threat. As they travel through exotic lands and finding more allies out of the pyromanical Fire Barons and the amazonian Zaulia tribe, they come across evidence of Eddie's father, the hero known as Riggnarok in this time. It tells that Riggnarok traveled to the future to attempt to learn the secrets of the Titans to bring back to the past in the humans' ongoing fight against the demons, but never returned.|$|E

2500|$|AE2s {{first attempt}} was made early on 24 April, but the boat only made it [...] into the strait before the forward {{hydroplane}} coupling failed, making the submarine impossible to control underwater and forced Stoker to retreat. At 02:30 on the following day, Stoker made a second attempt. The submarine was spotted by shore artillery and fired on from about 04:30; Stoker ordered the boat to dive to avoid the shells and to traverse the first minefield. AE2 spent the next hour picking {{her way through the}} mines' mooring cables: defensive wires that had been welded to the submarine in Malta prevented the mooring cables from catching. By 06:00, AE2 reached Chanak, and proceeded to torpedo a Turkish gunboat believed to be a Peyk-i Şevket-class cruiser while simultaneously taking evasive actions to avoid an enemy destroyer. The submarine ran aground beneath a Turkish fort, but the fort's guns could not be lowered enough to fire, and AE2 was able to free herself within four minutes. Shortly after, the submarine's periscope was sighted by a Turkish battleship firing over the peninsula at the Allied landing sites; this prompted the ship to stop firing and withdraw. AE2 advanced <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> of Marmara, and at 08:30, Stoker decided to rest the boat on the ocean bottom and wait until nightfall before continuing.|$|E
2500|$|The best current {{example is}} {{illustrated}} by the United States Geological Survey study of Columbia Glacier. [...] They noted that the average calving rate from Columbia Glacier increased from 3km3⋅a−1 {{in the second half of}} 1983 to 4km3⋅a−1 during the first nine months of 1984. This rate was four times greater than that measured at the end of 1977 and increased again in 1985. The glacier flow, i.e., the movement of the ice <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea,</b> also increased, it was inadequate to keep pace with the break-up and expulsion of icebergs. [...] The increase in speed instead seemed to just feed the ever faster conveyor to the terminus for iceberg production. This prompted the USGS to predict that the glacier would retreat 32km before stabilizing. [...] By 2006, it has retreated 16km. The water remains deep and the calving rate and glacier velocity very high, indicating retreat will continue. At this point, just like having a balloon payment in an adjustable rate mortgage, the glacier has to pay a whole new portion of its balance via icebergs. [...] The glacier accelerates as flow is enhanced by the calving process; this increases the export of icebergs from the glacier. [...] Large calving retreats are initiated by warming conditions causing ice thinning. [...] The resulting retreat to a new equilibrium conditions can be far more extensive than will be regained during the next advance stage. A good example of this is Muir Glacier.|$|E
2500|$|The parish, {{which is}} {{generally}} fertile and well cultivated, comprises [...] of land, [...] of water and [...] of foreshore and lies predominantly on granite. It is more elevated at its northern part and slopes gently north to south-east towards the sea.

Toward the south is the village of St Buryan, which sits on a plateau and is centrally sited within the parish. Further to the south the terrain slopes down <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea,</b> ending in several deep cut river valleys at Lamorna, Penberth and St Loy that are both sheltered and heavily forested. West of St Buryan, toward St Levan, the terrain again gently descends, causing the ground to become more marshy and waterlogged and less suitable for growing arable crops. East of the village the land also slopes away toward Drift, and its reservoir, past the wooded area at Pridden and the deep cut valley at Trelew (in which a steep embankment has been built to carry the B3283 road). Other settlements of note in the parish include Crows-an-Wra to the north, as well as Sparnon and Tregarnoe further south (see map, right). Since 1990 St Buryan and the surrounding region has been designated a conservation area by Penwith District Council; recognising the village's status as an area of special architectural and historic interest and preventing development that might alter the village's character.|$|E
