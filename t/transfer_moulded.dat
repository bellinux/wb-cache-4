40|$|Delamination {{and brittle}} matrix {{fracture}} has since {{long been a}} problem of fibre reinforced composites. This paper investigates if polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibre nonwovens can increase the interlaminar fracture toughness of resin <b>transfer</b> <b>moulded</b> glass fibre/epoxy laminates, without causing problems during impregnation and without negatively affecting other (mechanical) properties. The mode I fracture toughness was shown {{to be dependent on}} both the nanofibre content as well as on how the nanofibres were introduced into the laminates. Almost 100 % improvement in fracture toughness could be achieved by electrospinning the PCL nanofibres {{on both sides of the}} glass fibre mats prior to impregnation. This led to a mode I fracture toughness of over 1200 J/m 2. It could be concluded that even state of the art infusion resins with a high intrinsic fracture toughness can benefit significantly from nanofibre toughening...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the applicability of the acoustic emission (AE) and ultrasonic inspection (UT) technique for the monitoring of cure related defects in thick resin <b>transfer</b> <b>moulded</b> (RTM) products. The AE technique was applied for defect monitoring during the cooling down phase to room temperature while the UT technique was used to assess the final material quality of the product. The results of the investigation suggest a relation between AE activity, UT gain level and the presence of cure related defects such as shrinkage cracks and porosity. A higher level of AE activity corresponds in general with a higher UT attenuation level and a lower quality of the RTM product. The results of the investigation were used to detail the influence of RTM material and process parameters such as resin type (tough, brittle) and heating rate during RTM processing. The results were further used to optimise the design of the RTM product mould. 1...|$|E
40|$|Tomographic imaging {{using both}} microfocus {{radiation}} and synchrotron radiation {{was performed to}} assess the void defects in resin <b>transfer</b> <b>moulded</b> woven carbon fibre composites. The focus {{of this study is}} on characterising the void homology (e. g. local void size and spatial distribution) in relation to weave orientation, infusion direction and potential effects on damage formation in tensile loading. As the orientation angle between the fibre direction of unidirectional layer in the laminate and the direction of the global resin flow increases, from parallel to perpendicular, larger voids and a greater volume fraction of voids were observed, which led to increased damage formation upon loading. Significant accumulation of voids around both the layer interfaces and yarn fibres were also observed. With regard to yarn design, it is recommended to balance the benefits (e. g. fabric handling, structural integrity of preform) and drawbacks (e. g. lower fibre content, more voids) of the supporting yarn. Also, sensible placement of resin inlets and outlets could reduce the amount of deleterious voids, i. e. by promoting resin flow along the fibre direction in the most defect-sensitive off-axis layers...|$|E

The effect of using LPA on the thermo-mechanical properties of resin <b>transfer</b> <b>moulded</b> UP/fibreglass composites is investigated. The flexural and shear properties are measured by three-point bending tests. The trend of these mechanical properties is identified for 0 % to 40 % LPA content. All the mechanical properties like flexural strength, flexural modulus and short beam strength reduce upon addition of LPA. The specimens fail by tension in the flexural test and show a mixed shear/tension failure mode in case of short beam tests. From scanning electron microscopy, morphological change of the fractured surface is observed with an LPA-rich phase. Glass transition temperature (Tg) measured by thermal mechanical analysis (TMA) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) show reproducible data and compare well with each other.

The resin <b>transfer</b> <b>moulded</b> flax blade is 10 % lighter (fibre mass saving of 45 %) than the identical construction E-glass blade. Static flap-bending tests, conducted in accordance to certification standards, confirm that like the E-glass blade, the flax blade satisfies the structural integrity requirements under ‘normal operation’ and ‘worst case’ loading. It is consequently claimed that flax is a potential structural replacement to E-glass for similar composite small wind turbine blade applications. The failure root bending moment and corresponding tip displacement of the flax blade are 11. 6 kNm and 2300 mm, respectively. The blades exhibit distinctly different load–deflection curves and failure modes. The mean flexural rigidity of the flax and E-glass blades {{are estimated to be}} 24. 6 kNm 2 and 43. 4 kNm 2, respectively. It is interesting to find that although flax fibres and their composites are generally recognized for their stiffness, a flax blade cannot compete against an E-glass blade in terms of stiffness...|$|E

As {{an alternative to}} fabrics, which generally provide higher in-place properties, CFMs are often employed as low cost, 'lofty' (high uncompressed thickness, and therefore good specific flexural stiffness), easy to process reinforcements for Resin <b>Transfer</b> <b>Moulded</b> (RTM) parts. Within this project, investigation of permeability measurement has involved the development of two (radial and linear) liquid flow permeability techniques to provide a reliable and robust data set for a specific CFM (Unifilo U 813 - 300). Then two novel (radial and linear) airflow techniques were developed for the measurement of CFMs, these providing comparative results with the liquid flow measurements. The benefits of airflow versus liquid flow include cleaner, lower pressured flow using a fluid that may be produced by compressor rather than stored, therefore having significant benefits for both laboratory and industrial measurements of permeability. Material characterisation is necessary to analytically investigate reinforcement materials, as permeability has a non-linear relationship with overall porosity. Permeability is therefore considered {{as a function of}} pore distribution, which encompasses the two scales of intra and inter fibre-bundle flow. Two areas have been investigated, these involving permeability measurement and microstructure characterisation. Comparative permeability measurements of a second CFM (Unifilo U 850 - 300), consisting of a different arrangement of fibre bundle sizes, were undertaken using the 1 D airflow method, and inter-laminar flow was investigated using the radial airflow method. These resulted in a permeability ratio of between 0. 54 and 0. 64 (U 813 /U 850) across a 0. 1 to 0. 3 fibre volume fraction range for the two CFMs, and no significant inter-laminar pore space effect. Microstructural characterisation initiated with image analysis of electron micrographs, providing measurement of fibre diameters and intra-bundle porosity. Kozeny-Carman modelling then showed the permeability of intra-bundle areas to be insignificant resulting in a focus on inter-bundle flow. Although limited by assumptions made for various material parameters, semi-empirical models to provide inter-bundle porosity and fibre bundle geometries were developed. Relation with permeability was then achieved through calculating hydraulic radius and mean hydraulic radius and provision of a range of Kozeny constants (0. 55 to 6. 17) and coefficients to replace the Kozeny constant, which provide upper and lower bounds for the remaining factors of permeability. The overall future industrial benefits for material engineers rely on the addressing of these limitations for quantifying geometries, so as to provide clarity of the relationship between controllable material parameters and permeability.

Existing analytical models, such as generalised Hele-Shaw model, seem to be inadequate to model the process accurately in real world environment due to the complex inter-relationships among the encapsulant properties, process conditions, mould design parameters and overall moulding performance and the inherent fuzziness of the moulding systems. It is quite often that the observed values from the <b>transfer</b> <b>moulding</b> for microchip encapsulation may not be regular. Although statistical regression method could be used to perform the modelling, high degree of fuzziness inherent in <b>transfer</b> <b>moulding</b> systems for microchip encapsulation makes the obtained models having wide possibility range.
