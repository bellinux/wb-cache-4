5|$|Scott and {{his brother}} were inseparable {{when they were younger}} and often played hockey together. While their father was often their team doctor, their mother <b>taught</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> skate. She {{enrolled}} them in figure skating to aid their skills development and taught power skating classes in Cranbrook in exchange for ice time for her sons. An offensive defenceman, Scott led his Cranbrook midget team in scoring with 55 goals and 92 points in 1988–89.|$|E
5|$|Jacob Loucks Devers {{was born}} on 8 September 1887, in York, Pennsylvania, a small {{industrial}} town in the southeastern corner of the state. His parents were Philip Devers, a watchmaker and partner in a jewelry store, and Ella Kate Loucks Devers, a homemaker. He {{was the first of}} the couple's four children. He had two younger brothers, Frank and Phillip, and a younger sister, Catherine, known as Kitts. The Devers, of Irish and German-Alsatian ancestry, were strict, hardworking and religious. The family belonged to the Evangelical Lutheran Church, which did not believe in smoking or drinking. While providing a comfortable middle-class life for their children, the couple <b>taught</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> value dependability, integrity and industriousness.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Choy and her husband, Choy Khun Heng, {{were running}} their canteen at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, {{after all the}} {{patients}} and doctors had been moved from the Miyako Hospital (former Woodbridge Hospital). She had been a school teacher at St Andrew's School before the war. The couple helped the Changi prisoners-of-war (POW) by passing on cash and parcels containing such things as fresh clothing, medicine and letters during their deliveries. An informant told the Kempeitai that the Choys were involved in smuggling money into Changi Prison, and Khun Heng was arrested. After several days, Elizabeth went to the YMCA on Stamford Road, used by the Kempeitai as their headquarters, known as the Kempeitai East District Branch, to inquire about her husband. The Japanese denied all knowledge of him, but three weeks later they lured {{her back to the}} YMCA and confined her with other Chinese and Changi prisoners. There was no sign of Khun Heng. The prisoners were forbidden to speak to one another, although one of the internees, John Dunlop, secretly <b>taught</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> communicate in sign language.|$|E

25|$|Success {{prompted}} Ōkyo {{to start}} a school in Kyoto, where he could teach his new style. He was a talented art teacher, and he soon took on many students. He <b>taught</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> rely on nature to render images in a realistic picture of light, shadow, and forms. The school grew popular, and branches soon appeared in other locations, including Osaka. Much of the school's work is today preserved at Daijō-ji, a temple in Kasumi (Hyōgo Prefecture). Noteworthy pupils include Ōkyo's son, Maruyama Ōzui, Nagasawa Rosetsu, and Matsumura Goshun.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{have long}} been fascinated with the studies of language, believing {{it to be a}} unique human {{cognitive}} ability. To test this hypothesis, scientists have attempted to teach human language to several species of great apes. One early attempt by Allen and Beatrix Gardner in the 1960s involved spending 51 months teaching American Sign Language (ASL) to a chimpanzee named Washoe. The Gardners reported Washoe learned 151 signs, and she had spontaneously <b>taught</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> other chimpanzees. Over a longer period of time, Washoe learned over 800 signs.|$|E

25|$|After their {{defeat at}} Cannae, the Romans {{generally}} followed {{the policy of}} their statesman Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, who <b>taught</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> avoid general confrontations with Hannibal, {{in order to preserve}} their own strength and gradually diminish his. They sought to wear him out in a series of smaller engagements and sieges (see Fabian strategy). As evidenced by the unceasing sequence of defeats (e. g. the battle of Herdonia in 212 BC), this strategy was not always followed. One of the generals who did not comply completely was Marcus Claudius Marcellus. He had distinguished himself before the Punic invasion as a conqueror of Cisalpine Gaul. He gained even more prominence {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the battle of Cannae, when he repeatedly denied Hannibal entrance to Nola, thus reducing Roman losses in Campania, where Capua defected.|$|E
25|$|The {{education}} of boys began {{in their own}} home up until the age of seven when they had to attend school. There, they had several teachers who <b>taught</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> read and write, as well as subjects such as mathematics and music. Boys also had to take part in physical education classes where they were prepared for future military service with activities such as wrestling, racing, jumping and gymnastics. At eighteen they served in the army and were instructed on how to bear arms. Physical education was very intense and many of the boys ended up becoming true athletes. In addition to these compulsory lessons, the students had the chance to discuss and learn from the great philosophers, grammarians and orators of the time. Some poor people had to stay at home and help their parents. However Aristophanes and Socrates, though they were poor, became famous and successful.|$|E
25|$|Demeter's {{search for}} her {{daughter}} Persephone {{took her to the}} palace of Celeus, the King of Eleusis in Attica. She assumed the form of an old woman, and asked him for shelter. He took her in, to nurse Demophon and Triptolemus, his sons by Metanira. To reward his kindness, she planned to make Demophon immortal; she secretly anointed the boy with ambrosia and laid him in the flames of the hearth, to gradually burn away his mortal self. But Metanira walked in, saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright. Demeter abandoned the attempt. Instead, she taught Triptolemus the secrets of agriculture, and he in turn <b>taught</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> any who wished to learn them. Thus, humanity learned how to plant, grow and harvest grain. The myth has several versions; some are linked to figures such as Eleusis, Rarus and Trochilus. The Demophon element may be based on an earlier folk tale.|$|E

25|$|Bachué: {{the mother}} of the Muisca people. It was said that a {{beautiful}} woman with a baby came out of Lake Iguaque. Bachué sat down at the bank of the lake and waited for her son to grow up. When he was old enough, they married and had many children, who were the Muisca. Bachué <b>taught</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> hunt, to farm, to respect the laws, and to worship the gods. Bachué was so good and loved that the Muisca referred to her as Furachoque (Good woman in Chibcha). When they became old, Bachué and her son and husband {{decided to go back to}} the deep of the lagoon. That day the Muisca were so sad, but at the same time very happy because they knew their mother was very happy. Other versions of the legend say that after stepping into the lagoon of Iguaque, Bachué ascended to the sky and became Chía; in other versions Chia and Bachué are two different figures.|$|E
25|$|The Matthew Cooke Manuscript is {{the second}} oldest of the Old Charges or Gothic Constitutions of Freemasonry, and the oldest known set of charges to be written in prose. It {{contains}} some repetition, but compared to the Regius there is also much new material, much of which is repeated in later constitutions. After an opening thanksgiving prayer, the text enumerates the Seven Liberal Arts, giving precedence to geometry, which it equates with masonry. There follows {{the tale of the}} children of Lamech, expanded from the Book of Genesis. Jabal discovered geometry, and became Cain's Master Mason. Jubal discovered music, Tubal Cain discovered metallurgy and the art of the smith, while Lamech's daughter Naamah invented weaving. Discovering that the earth would be destroyed either by fire or by flood, they inscribed all their knowledge on two pillars of stone, one that would be impervious to fire, and one that would not sink. Generations after the flood both pillars were discovered, one by Pythagoras, the other by the philosopher Hermes. The seven sciences were then passed down through Nimrod, the architect of the Tower of Babel, to Abraham, who <b>taught</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the Egyptians, including Euclid, who in turn taught masonry to the children of the nobility as an instructive discipline. The craft is then taught to the children of Israel, and from the Temple of Solomon finds its way to France, and thence to Saint Alban's England. Athelstan now became one of a line of kings actively supporting masonry. His youngest son, unnamed here, is introduced {{for the first time as}} leader and mentor of masons. There follow nine articles and nine points, and the document finishes in a similar manner to the Regius.|$|E
500|$|While the Concordat {{restored}} {{much power}} to the papacy, the balance of church–state relations had tilted firmly in Napoleon's favour. He selected the bishops and supervised church finances. Napoleon and the pope both found the Concordat useful. Similar arrangements were made with the Church in territories controlled by Napoleon, especially Italy and Germany. Now, Napoleon could win favor with the Catholics while also controlling Rome in a political sense. Napoleon said in April 1801, [...] "Skillful conquerors have not got entangled with priests. They can both contain them and use them". French children were issued a catechism that <b>taught</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> love and respect Napoleon.|$|E

He <b>taught</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> ski and took them skiing in Colorado. He once rented a small plane to fly them and their friends from Texas to a summer camp in Maine. Later, he doted on his six grandchildren as well. After Apollo 14 he began {{to spend more time}} with Louise, and started taking her with him on trips to the Paris Air Show every other year, and to Asia. Louise heard rumors of his affairs. The publication of Tom Wolfe's 1979 book The Right Stuff made them public knowledge, but she never confronted him about it, nor did she [...] ever contemplate leaving him.|$|E
500|$|Eddy {{allowed her}} {{students}} to make copies of the manuscripts, but they were forbidden, under a $3,000 bond, from showing them to anyone. The students agreed to pay Eddy 10 percent annually of income derived from her work, and $1,000 if they failed to practice or teach it. She at first <b>taught</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> rub patients' heads, to [...] "lay [...] hands where the belief is to rub it out forever"; Kennedy would manipulate each student's head and solar plexus before class in preparation. The head rubbing was abandoned when the women complained about having to take their hair down, and the stomach rubbing held no appeal for them either. Eventually Eddy told them to ignore {{that part of the}} manuscript, and from then on Christian Science healing did not involve touching patients.|$|E

Golf became a passion of Katharine's; she took daily lessons and became very adept, reaching the semi-final of the Connecticut Young Women's Golf Championship. She loved swimming in Long Island Sound, and took ice-cold baths every morning {{in the belief that}} [...] "the bitterer the medicine, the better it was for you."

500|$|Unseen by the Allies, Seydlitz {{assembled}} his cavalry {{into two}} lines, one of 20 squadrons {{and the second}} of 18, and reduced the speed of his approach {{until they reached the}} screening ridge of the Pölzen hill. There, they waited. Seydlitz sat {{at the head of the}} lines, calmly smoking his pipe. When the Allied cavalry came within striking distance, 1000 paces from the crest of the ridge, he tossed his pipe in the air: this was the signal to charge. At 3:30 pm, Seydlitz crested the hill and his first 20 squadrons descended on the Allied army; [...] the leading Allied cuirassiers managed to deploy to meet Seydlitz's squadrons, but the momentum of the Prussian attack penetrated the Allied lines and wrought havoc among the disorganized mass. Prussian cavalry rode flank to flank; their training had <b>taught</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> form a line three and four deep from a column without breaking pace; once formed into a line, the troopers rode with knees touching, the horses' flanks touching, and horses riding tail to nose. Any attack of Prussian cavalry on open ground meant a line of horses—big Trakehners —bearing down on infantry or cavalry columns, lines, or squares. The horsemen could maneuver at a full gallop, to the left or right, or in an oblique.|$|E
