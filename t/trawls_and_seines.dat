25|$|The bumpnose trevally, Carangoides hedlandensis (also {{known as}} the bumpnose {{kingfish}} and onion kingfish) is a species of relatively small inshore marine fish classified in the jack family Carangidae. The bumpnose trevally is fairly common in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-west Pacific region, ranging from South Africa {{in the west to}} Japan and Samoa in the east. It is a small species by carangid standards, reaching a maximum known length of 32cm, and can be distinguished from the similarly shaped Carangoides armatus by a distinct 'bump' on the snout, which gives the fish its common name. The species inhabits coastal waters, often living along bays and beaches, where it takes shrimp, small crabs, and juvenile fish as prey. The bumpnose trevally is of minor importance to fisheries throughout its range, taken by hook <b>and</b> line, <b>trawls,</b> <b>and</b> <b>seine</b> nets.

40|$|In {{this report}} {{the results of}} the cod {{monitoring}} program are presented. This research was commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. Cod catches of the vessels in the gear groups BT 2 (beam trawl) and TR (otter <b>trawls</b> <b>and</b> <b>seines)</b> need to be monitored yearly, due to the Dutch implementation of the European cod recovery plan. The European cod recovery plan restricts fishing efforts of European fleets that catch cod. Fishing effort, based on historical track records, is allocated to different gear groups. Fishing effort can be transferred between gear groups but then conversion factors apply. In the Netherlands fishing effort is transferred yearly from the BT 2 gear group to the TR group, based on a national conversion factor of 1 : 3 (BT:TR) kWdays instead of the European conversion factor of 1 : 16, because the cod catches in the Dutch TR fleet are not as high as the European conversion factor implies. In order to substantiate for the national conversion factor, the Dutch government is obliged to report cod catches per unit of effort (CpUE) of the vessels in these gear groups to the European Commission...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to explore the habitat characteristics and dispersal of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), an exotic fish in the Great Lakes. Three surveys using SCUBA, <b>trawls</b> <b>and</b> <b>seines</b> were conducted in the western basin of Lake Erie to identify assemblages of fishes before and after the appearance of round gobies. Round gobies were not present in the surveys conducted during 1995, however 54 round gobies were caught in trawls in 1996, and were visible at Colchester Reef and Middle Sister Island during the SCUBA survey. Round gobies were separated in space from an assemblage of pelagic fishes. Line transects with use of SCUBA were conducted at 3 sites along the Huron/Erie corridor to examine habitat preference in day and night by round gobies. Mark-recapture (dye injection) and observational SCUBA studies were used to determine site affinity and home range of the round goby in the Detroit River.

40|$|Abstract. —Young-of-year {{gizzard shad}} Dorosoma cepedianum. the primary prey for piscivores in Ohio impoundments, are {{difficult}} to sample by conventional techniques. We developed a tech-nique for sampling littoral zone quadrats with rotenone and compared this method to other gear. To sample, we isolated 0. 15 -hectare shoreline areas (N = 28 quadrats) with a plastic barrier, which confined the rotenone and even small fish, and applied rotenone at concentrations of 2 - 3 mg/L. To quantify densities of dead fish that sank, about 18 % of the bottom within quadrats was covered with netting. These nets eliminated the need for species-specific recovery rates, which typically are highly variable. Tucker <b>trawls</b> <b>and</b> <b>seines</b> provided lower density and size estimates of gizzard shad than did our quadrat method. Despite difficulties associated with the quadrat rotenone technique such as site selection, variability, and personnel requirements, this method provided the best estimate of size structure and density of gizzard shad populations. To determine if prey size or density influenced stocking success of age- 0 piscivores, we used our estimates of gizzard shad biomass and growth to calculate total production of prey (71. 3 kg/hectare) during its first growing season. Five taxa of piscivorous fish were stocked and their growth and survival were monitored in conjunction with regular estimates of gizzard shad. Total consumption of prey by all predators...|$|E

40|$|North Carolina both {{historically}} and currently maintains {{one of the}} most productive fishery resource basins in the nation. However, fish stocks are spatially and temporally variable in abundance and distribution in estuarine ecosystems and the influence of changing environmental factors on the inhabiting fish community of Albemarle Sound, North Carolina has not been studied. Sites within Albemarle Sound were sampled (<b>trawls</b> <b>and</b> <b>seines)</b> monthly by the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries from 1972 to 2012. A total of 56 families representing 132 fish species including freshwater, estuarine, and marine species were represented in sampling Anchoa mitchilli, Menidia beryllina, Micropogonias undulates, Leiostomus xanthurus, Alosa aestivalis and Morone Americana were the most abundant species in sampling. Two gear types were utilized during sampling, and the composition of fish assemblages collected between the two gears were significantly different (ANOSIM R= 0. 759, p= 0. 001). 1) Spatial analysis: Salinity and wind direction were significantly correlated with for the seine samples spatially (R= 0. 754, p= 0. 01), cumulatively describing 51. 9 % of the total variation in species assemblage. For trawl samples, salinity and dissolved oxygen were significantly correlated with differences in species assemblages (R= 0. 683, p= 0. 001), which cumulatively described 38. 3 % of the variation in the biological patterns. 2) Temporal analysis: Temporal correlations were weaker than spatial correlations, with depth, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and wind speed only weakly correlated with species assemblage (R= 0. 28, p= 0. 01) for the seine samples, and cumulatively described 14. 5 % of the variation. For the trawl samples, depth and salinity were weakly correlated with biological patterns (R= 0. 299, p= 0. 01), cumulatively describing 15. 5 % of the variation in the biological patterns. These results suggest that spatial variability in fish assemblage and biological patterns in Albemarle Sound are best described by salinity, with northeast and southwest winds indirectly influencing these patterns through wind driven tides. Temporally, correlations were weak and the amount of variability described was moderate, indicating there are other major factors influencing these patterns and fish assemblages through time.   M.

40|$|In the European Union, the {{collection}} of discard data is enforced through the Data Collection Regulation or Framework (DCF) of the European Commission (EC). To comply with this ruling, approximately ten trips of discard-intensive beam-trawlers are being monitored annually since 1999 (Helmond and Overzee, 2010). In 2009, revisions to the DCF (2008 / 949 /EG), required member states to increase sampling intensity to i) improve the precision of their estimates and ii) the number of sampled métiers. To meet this requirement within an affordable budget, the Institute for Marine Resources and Ecosystem Studies (IMARES, part of Wageningen University and Research) set up a collaborative project between the Dutch fishing industry and the research institute to recruit a ‘reference fleet’ of vessel owners {{willing to participate in}} a selfsampling programme. In the self-sampling programme, trips were pre-determined from a reference fleet of participating vessels. In total, 155 trips were sampled in 2011, of which 27 trips (17 %) were considered invalid due to missing or incomplete information. During the 128 valid self-sampling trips 248 hauls were sampled. While the majority of observations were done on board beamtrawl vessels with mesh sizes ranging between 70 and 99 mm targeting flatfish, data was collected from eight other metiers as well. These included beam trawls with other mesh sizes or target species assemblages, otter <b>trawls</b> <b>and</b> <b>seines.</b> This led, apart from a considerable increase in sampling effort for some métiers, to an increase in the temporal and spatial spread of sampling compared to the previous observer-based sampling. Samples from previously unsampled northern and eastern parts of the North Sea were available now. The spatial distribution of sampling locations matched that of the total effort of the fleet for intensivelysampled métiers. Large-mesh beam- and otter trawls (100 - 119 mm) on average landed more than they discarded. In the other métiers, combined fish and benthos discards exceeded the volume of landings. The majority of discards comprised of benthic (invertebrate) species such as common starfish (Asteria rubens); sand star (Astropecten irregularis); swimming crab (Liocarcinus holsatus); and serpent star (Ophiura ophiura). Most frequently discarded fish species of no commercial value included: dragonet (Callionymus lyra); grey gurnard (Eutrigla gurnardus); scaldfish (Arnoglossus laterna); solenette (Buglossidium luteum); and lesser weaver (Echiichthys vipera).

Surveys suggest that blue crab abundance fluctuates without an apparent trend, yet {{there is still a}} successful annual commercial fishery that even attracts crabbers from the Chesapeake Bay. Since 1990, commercial landings for crabs have averaged from 0. 5 to 1. 5 million pounds. Commercial landings for 2003 were 1. 17 million pounds. Unlike Chesapeake Bay landings data, these appear to fluctuate without trend. During 2003, the fishery independent <b>trawl</b> <b>and</b> <b>seine</b> survey caught a total of 6, 754 blue crabs.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2013 Estuaries in Southeast Alaska provide {{habitat for}} juveniles and adults of several {{commercial}} fish and invertebrate species; however, {{because of the}} area's size and challenging environment, very {{little is known about}} the spatial structure and distribution of estuarine species in relation to the biotic and abiotic environment. This study uses advanced machine learning algorithms (random forest and multivariate random forest) and landscape and seascape-scale environmental variables to develop predictive models of species occurrence and community composition within Southeast Alaskanestuaries. Species data were obtained from <b>trawl</b> <b>and</b> <b>seine</b> sampling in 49 estuaries throughout the study area. Environmental data were compiled and extracted from existing spatial datasets. Individual models for species occurrence were validated using independent data from seine surveys in 88 estuaries. Prediction accuracy for individual species models ranged from 94 % to 63 %, with 76 % of the fish species models and 72 % of the invertebrate models having a predictive accuracy of 70 % or better. The models elucidated complex species-habitat relationships that can be used to identify habitat protection priorities and to guide future research. The multivariate models demonstrated that community composition was strongly related to regional patterns of precipitation and tidal energy, as well as to local abundance of intertidal habitat and vegetation. The models provide insight into how changes in species abundance are influenced by both environmental variation and the co-occurrence of other species. Taxonomic diversity in the region was high (74 %) and functional diversity was relatively low (23 %). Functional diversity was not linearly correlated to species richness, indicating that the number of species in the estuary was not a good predictor of functional diversity or redundancy. Functional redundancy differed across estuary clusters, suggesting that some estuaries have a greater potential for loss of functional diversity with species removal than others...|$|R
