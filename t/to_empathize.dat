5|$|In {{creating}} the game, Rohrer {{was influenced by}} his childhood fear of his house being robbed, numerous publicized shootings, and his own political views regarding gun rights and home invasions. During development and beta testing, the game went through several changes that increased its difficulty. It received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the design and creativity and others finding it hard <b>to</b> <b>empathize</b> with the game's intended message.|$|E
5|$|Goffman {{uses the}} metaphor of {{conversation}} being a stage play. A plays tone will shift throughout the performance due to the actions taken by the actors; {{this is similar to}} how a discussion is keyed – based on what either person says or does over the course of an interaction, the key will change accordingly. The parallels go further, though. Goffman also claims that a speaker details a drama more often than they provide information. They invite the listener <b>to</b> <b>empathize</b> and, as was explained above, they’re often not meant to be stirred to take action, but rather to show appreciation; during a play this generally takes the form of applause.|$|E
5|$|Mikhail Tanich {{wrote the}} lyrics to every song the group {{performed}} until his death on April 17, 2008. In writing {{the lyrics to}} the songs Lesopoval performed, Mikhail Tanich drew on the six years he spent in a Soviet labor camp, during which time he came <b>to</b> <b>empathize</b> with criminals {{from all walks of}} life. In total, the group released at least 19 albums, including one after Mikhail Tanich's death. Until his death in 1994, Sergey Korzhukov wrote the musical melodies and performed most of the songs; after his death, other artists wrote and performed the melodies. Musically, most songs feature a guitar, drums, accordions, and are often performed with strong vocals.|$|E
50|$|One {{study used}} EEG {{to observe the}} brain {{activity}} of individuals with schizophrenia when shown hands and feet in painful situations. The results of the experiments suggested the ability to separate 'self' from 'others', which is essential <b>to</b> <b>empathizing</b> with other people, is impaired in the schizophrenic sample. Another study concluded that schizophrenic individuals tend to process ‘other’ related pain stimuli {{in a way that}} is usually more associated with how self relevant stimuli are processed and it is because of this these individuals are less able to differentiate between the ‘self’ and the ‘other’.|$|R
50|$|Subsequent episodes {{were met}} with lesser praise by some critics, criticizing the show's {{reliance}} upon increasingly implausible red herrings to drive each episode and the withholding of details about each character's background, especially Rosie's, thus making them difficult to relate <b>to</b> or <b>empathize</b> with.|$|R
50|$|One common bias people {{exhibit in}} {{attribution}} {{is called the}} fundamental attribution error. The fundamental attribution error is the tendency for people to attribute others' actions or behaviors to internal traits as opposed to external circumstances. An example of how this may manifest {{in the real world}} as pointed out in research by Furnham and Gunter is how one's view of the justness of poverty may be affected by one's financial status: one who has not experienced poverty may see it as being more or less deserved than might someone who has been impoverished at some point. In this way, fundamental attribution error can be a barrier <b>to</b> <b>empathizing</b> with others, as one does not consider all the circumstances involved in the actions of others.|$|R
5|$|Dearly Stars sold 30,786 {{copies in}} its first week of release in Japan, and ranked as the tenth best-selling video game in Japan that week. The game {{received}} a score of 30 out of 40 from the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu. Critics have described Dearly Stars as suitable for beginners to the Idolmaster series for drawing out the series' essence and reorganizing it into a simpler and easier-to-understand form. At the same time, Famitsu reviewer Sekai Sandai Miyokawa thinks that fans of the series will feel from Dearly Stars {{the growth of the}} 765 Pro idols and the overall growth of the series. Reviewers note that despite the change in the game's details compared to previous games in the series, such as the change in perspective from the producer to the idol, Dearly Stars still plays like an Idolmaster game. However, another Famitsu reviewer stated that because other aspects of the gameplay in Dearly Stars are similar to previous Idolmaster games such as doing lessons and auditions, the sense of enjoyment is not that different from other games. A reviewer for Famitsu felt it was easier <b>to</b> <b>empathize</b> with an idol when the story was told from their perspective.|$|E
5|$|Studio Ghibli's Yoshiyuki Momose {{served as}} the {{director}} of animation, drawing character designs and storyboards. Hino wished Dominion of the Dark Djinn and Wrath of the White Witch to have a heartwarming feel; the artwork and character movements was greatly inspired by Studio Ghibli's work, particularly due to their attention to detail, as well as their talent in creating storyboards and utilizing camera control. The development team constantly watched Studio Ghibli's films during development. The team wanted the theme of the game to resonate with children; they initially considered the idea of expressing adventure and dreams. They later explored the concept of a child's greatest influence, their mother, and the possibility of losing them. The game's main playable character, Oliver, is a 13-year-old boy. The team decided to make him a child as they wished to showcase a coming of age story. They wanted children <b>to</b> <b>empathize</b> with Oliver's development, and adults to relive the excitement of their adolescence.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{had wanted}} to make a horror game for eight years prior to Phantasmagoria, and had started to design one on several occasions, but none came to fruition. She felt the {{computer}} game industry and software technology had not yet reached the point where an effective and frightening computer game could be made. As a result, she decided to wait until CD-ROMs were faster and could handle real actors, which she believed was crucial for a horror game because she felt the player had to be able <b>to</b> <b>empathize</b> with the character to fear for them. Williams had been considering several horror story ideas for years before making the game. In one, the heroine answers a magician's advertisement for an assistant and gets the job, but the magician turns out to be insane. Another was set in the past, with the female protagonist getting involved in the supernatural life of a magician character. That idea evolved into a woman being married to a man who is drawn to a bizarre house that previously belonged to illusionists and is haunted by ghosts. The final story as it appears in the game has a contemporary setting, but combines elements from modern fiction, 19th century literature, and classic horror films of the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|There is {{uncertainty}} {{regarding the}} gender gap {{between males and females}} with AS. A person with Asperger's is often remarked as possessing masculine traits like emotional distance from the inability <b>to</b> <b>empathize,</b> and far more boys than girls are diagnosed with Asperger's. Most studies on the syndrome were derived from research on males, neglecting specific attention to females with AS who often go misdiagnosed. For the most part, studies on girls with Asperger's are anecdotal.|$|E
25|$|The {{inability}} {{to relate to}} others {{is also known as}} emotional detachment. Emotional detachment makes it difficult for an individual <b>to</b> <b>empathize</b> with others or to share their own feelings. An emotionally detached person may try to rationalize or apply logic to a situation to which there is no logical explanation. These individuals tend to stress the importance of their independence and may be a bit neurotic. Oftentimes, the {{inability to}} relate to others stems from a traumatic event.|$|E
40|$|The 'Empathy Quotient' (EQ) and 'Systemizing Quotient' (SQ) {{are used}} {{worldwide}} <b>to</b> measure people's <b>empathizing</b> and systemizing cognitive styles. This study investigates {{the psychometric properties}} of the Dutch EQ and SQ in healthy participants (n = 685), and high functioning males with autism spectrum disorder (n = 42). Factor analysis provided support for three subscales of the abridged 28 -item EQ: Cognitive Empathy, Emotional Empathy and Social Skills. Overall, the Dutch EQ and SQ appeared reliable and valid tools <b>to</b> assess <b>empathizing</b> and systemizing cognitive style in healthy adults and high functioning adults with autism. The literature showed good cross-cultural stability of the SQ and EQ in Western countries, but in Asian countries EQ is less stable and less sensitive to sex differences...|$|R
40|$|Most people’s actions serve goals that, defined {{abstract}}ly enough, {{are quite}} similar to one another. The authors thus proposed, and found, that construing action in abstract (vs. concrete) terms relates to perceiving greater similarity among persons both within and across different social groups (Studies 1 – 3). By fostering perspective taking, viewing action abstractly also related <b>to</b> <b>empathizing</b> with and expressing willingness to help nonstigmatized and stigmatized others (e. g., AIDS patients; Studies 3 – 5) and to donating money to help those in need (Study 6). These findings held when controlling for ideological, motivational, and broad personality variables. Abstract action construals, then, appear to blur social distinctions, fostering perspective taking and empathy {{on the one hand}} but also perceptions of group homogeneity on the other. What prompts people to treat others with care and respect? One answer to this question centers on {{the degree to which they}} perceive similarity between themselves and others. Perceiving similarity between oneself and others can lead one to take others...|$|R

25|$|September – Presidency of the Seventy member Rasband gave a BYU address (later {{reprinted in}} the Ensign) {{in which he}} {{addressed}} concerns about the church's involvement in politics. He shared hypothetical stories of a man fired for being gay and a woman marginalized at work for being Mormon and bemoaned that it is less politically correct <b>to</b> <b>empathize</b> with the religious woman. He invited listeners to discuss LGBT rights and religious freedom and to write comments on his Facebook post.|$|E
25|$|These {{findings}} can {{be explained}} in terms of self-categorization and empathy. From the perspective of self-categorization theory, a person’s own social identity, well-being is tied to their group membership so that when a group based identity is salient, the suffering of one group member can be considered to directly affect the group. Because of this shared identity, referred to as self-other merging, bystanders are able <b>to</b> <b>empathize,</b> which has been found to predict helping behaviour. For example, in a study relating to helping after eviction both social identification and empathy were found to predict helping. However, when social identification was controlled for, empathy no longer predicted helping behaviour.|$|E
25|$|The {{understanding}} of friendship in children {{tends to be}} more heavily focused on areas such as common activities, physical proximity, and shared expectations. These friendships provide opportunity for playing and practicing self-regulation. Most children tend to describe friendship in terms of things like sharing, and children are more likely to share with someone they consider to be a friend. As children mature, they become less individualized and are more aware of others. They gain the ability <b>to</b> <b>empathize</b> with their friends, and enjoy playing in groups. They also experience peer rejection as they move through the middle childhood years. Establishing good friendships at a young age helps a child to be better acclimated in society later on in their life.|$|E
50|$|Research {{investigating}} the social response to natural disasters {{looked at the}} characteristics associated with individuals who help victims. Researchers found that cognitive empathy, rather than emotional empathy, predicted helping behavior towards victims. Others have posited that taking on the perspectives of others (cognitive empathy) allows these individuals <b>to</b> better <b>empathize</b> with victims without as much discomfort, whereas sharing the emotions of the victims (emotional empathy) can cause emotional distress, helplessness, victim-blaming, and ultimately can lead to avoidance rather than helping.|$|R
50|$|Most Conjoiners {{perceive}} the cultural barrier {{between them and}} baseline humans as essentially insurmountable, and insist that the ecstatic experience of being conjoined, as well as vastly elevated states of consciousness it produces, is by definition incomprehensible to the non-uplifted. Episodes where a baseline human character experiences Transenlightenment (or even its glimpses) seem to confirm this. Conversely, this cultural barrier sometimes backfires on the Conjoiners themselves: {{one of them is}} visibly unsettled by realization that she and a baseline human are, in fact, able <b>to</b> emotionally <b>empathize.</b>|$|R

25|$|Early in 1919, Guderian was {{selected}} {{as one of the}} four thousand officers to continue on in military service for the reduced size German army, the Reichswehr. He was assigned to serve {{on the staff of the}} central command of the Eastern Frontier Guard Service. This Guard Service was intended to control and coordinate the independent Freikorps units in the defense of Germany's eastern frontiers against Polish and Soviet forces engaged in the Russian Civil War. In June 1919, Guderian joined the Iron Brigade (later known as the Iron Division) as its second General Staff officer. The commanders of the regular German army had intended that this move would allow the army to reassert its control over the Iron Division; however, their hopes were disappointed. Rather than restrain the Freikorps, Guderian's anti-communism caused him <b>to</b> <b>empathize</b> with the Iron Division's efforts to defend Prussia against the Soviet threat. The Iron Division waged a ruthless campaign in Lithuania and pushed into Latvia; however, traditional German anti-Slavic attitudes prevented the division's full cooperation with the White Russian and Baltic forces opposing the Bolsheviks.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the first}} season of Glee, Sue makes {{numerous}} attempts at sabotaging the William McKinley High School glee club, New Directions. She enlists members of her cheerleading squad, the Cheerios, to bring the club down from the inside, and conspires to lure away its star member, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele). Sue is appointed co-director of the club by Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), but soon scales back her involvement when her attempts to turn the club members against director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) fail. Hoping to ruin the club's chances of winning at the show choir Sectionals competition, Sue gives New Directions' setlist to the directors of their rival glee clubs. Despite having to devise a new setlist at the last moment, New Directions win by unanimous decision and Sue is suspended by Figgins. She blackmails him into allowing her back, and is selected as a judge for the show choir Regionals competition. Sue is ridiculed by the other judges for her lack of fame and underdog status, allowing her <b>to</b> <b>empathize</b> with the glee club members. She votes for New Directions to win, and although they place last, she blackmails Figgins into allowing them another year to compete.|$|E

However, Thelma tells Peter a startling secret: on the day Peter was born, {{he was not in}} America, but rather in Mexico and she never filled out his citizenship papers, making Peter an illegal immigrant. Peter is subsequently unemployed and the family begins to fall into debt. After Peter fails to find any good jobs, Lois turns to her father Carter for assistance. Carter agrees to employ Peter as a servant on his estate, and the Griffins move into a settlement of other Mexican immigrants near Carter's mansion. Of course, working as a servant proves gruelling for Peter, who begins <b>to</b> <b>empathize</b> with the immigrants. He forms a friendship with them and they invite him to a party, however, Carter crashes the party by reminding him of American regulations. Peter is outraged and rallies up the immigrants to form a rebellion. Carter decides to negotiate with Peter, saying he will arrange for Peter to gain American citizenship if he calls off the rebellion. Peter demands that everyone must gain citizenship, but the others insist that he take this opportunity, saying that their day will come someday. Peter agrees, and from this point onward Peter becomes an official American citizen; the family moves back to their house and Peter regains his job.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a {{questionnaire}} that can observe empathy in group psychoanalytic psychotherapy and examine the structure of its factors. A questionnaire comprised of 160 items in five-point Likert-type scale was developed through analysis of communication and interaction related <b>to</b> <b>empathizing</b> during group sessions. The questionnaire was applied on 256 patients from 40 therapy groups in 9 cities in Croatia. All 20 group analysts are trained in the Institute for Group Analysis in Zagreb. The patients were selected based on group analysis criteria. After item discrimination and principal component analysis limited to five factors were assessed, 80 items were isolated, 20 of which made a control scale for socially desirable responses. Two parallel questionnaire forms were developed: Group-Analysis-Empathy 1 (GA-Em 1) and Group-Analysis-Empathy 2 (GA-Em 2). A new, reliable and valid questionnaire for empathy observation employable in group psychotherapy was designed. The following factors were isolated by means of factor analysis: 1. Emotional disclosure and sensibility; 2. Containing and metabolizing; 3. Immersion; 4. Resonance and responsiveness; 5. Insight. A new questionnaire on empathy in group-analytical psychotherapy can measure the capacity for emotional communication among group members and between the group and the group analyst – conductor...|$|R

40|$|All {{athletes are}} driven by motivation, sources or reasons to push their bodies to their limits and {{continue}} to do so regularly. There have been several studies concerning motivation in typical athletes, and many regarding social motivation in people with High Functioning Autism (HFA), however most have been limited to children, and there have been no investigations into HFA athletes’ motivation. The current study looks into the role of social dimensions in athletics, and tests how one’s gender and placement on the Empathy Questionnaire (EQ), Systemizing Questionnaire (SQ), and on the Autism Questionnaire (AQ) affect intrinsic motivation in athletics. It was predicted that athletes with HFA would demonstrate greater levels of intrinsic motivation than those with lower scores on the Systemizing and Autism Questionnaires. The second hypothesis predicted that those who are more prone to systematizing (and perhaps higher on the AQ) would be more intrinsically motivated than those who are more prone <b>to</b> <b>empathizing,</b> as social rewards may not be as important to them. To uncover the differences between intrinsic motivation due to placement on the AQ, SQ and EQ, as well as differences between sexes and coaching feedback, a combination of Linear Regression Analyses, Independent Groups T-Tests and Correlations (n= 25) were used. The first hypothesis was invalid due to lack of recruitment of HFA participants, but the second was supported by the data...|$|R
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that, {{in addition to}} its base functions, the insula {{may play a role in}} certain higher-level functions that operate only in humans and other great apes. The spindle neurons found at a higher density in the right frontal insular cortex are also found in the anterior cingulate cortex, which is another region that has reached a high level of specialization in great apes. It has been speculated that these neurons are involved in cognitive-emotional processes that are specific to primates including great apes, such as empathy and metacognitive emotional feelings. This is supported by functional imaging results showing that the structure and function of the right frontal insula is correlated with the ability to feel one's own heartbeat, or <b>to</b> <b>empathize</b> with the pain of others. It is thought that these functions are not distinct from the lower-level functions of the insula but rather arise as a consequence of the role of the insula in conveying homeostatic information to consciousness. The right anterior insula aids interoceptive awareness of body states, such as the ability to time one's own heartbeat. Moreover, greater right anterior insular gray matter volume correlates with increased accuracy in this subjective sense of the inner body, and with negative emotional experience. It is also involved in the control of blood pressure, in particular during and after exercise, and its activity varies with the amount of effort a person believes he/she is exerting.|$|E
25|$|Aquaman's {{most widely}} {{recognized}} {{power is the}} telepathic {{ability to communicate with}} marine life, which he can summon from great distances. Although this power is most often and most easily used on beings that live in the sea, Aquaman has at times demonstrated the ability to affect any being that lives upon the sea (e.g., sea eagles), or even any being evolved from marine life (e.g., humans and some aliens). Before the New 52 Aquaman had access to a morphogenic field phenomenon called The Clear, an existential effigy that connects all oceanic and sea related life together as a whole, allowing him <b>to</b> <b>empathize</b> and share in the experiences of all aquatic based lifeforms. Per the 2011 DC continuity reboot, Aquaman's telepathy has been greatly downplayed: acknowledging that most marine life doesn't possess enough intelligence to carry a meaningful telepathic communication, Aquaman is now stated to simply add compulsions and needs in the mindset of aquatic life, compelling them to do his bidding by a subtle altering of their cerebellum. He has shown to have been blessed by the Sea God Poseidon possibly regaining a stronger but latent connection to The Clear when he was shown to bend the poisonous bile emitting from an old world structure that had intruded from the sea poisoning it with dark magic, developing some liquid manipulatory abilities. This blessing also gave him a protective charm against the foul magics of the Thule dimension it had originated from.|$|E
