In 2001, the Press Complaints Commission upheld a {{complaint}} by Rowling over {{a series of}} unauthorised photographs of her with her daughter {{on the beach in}} Mauritius published in OK! magazine. In 2007, Rowling's young son, David, assisted by Rowling and her husband, lost a court fight to ban publication of a photograph of him. The photo, taken by a photographer using a long-range lens, was subsequently published in a Sunday Express article featuring Rowling's family life and motherhood. The judgement was overturned in David's favour in May 2008.|$|E
5|$|Growth {{rates of}} pterosaurs once they hatched varied across {{different}} groups. In more primitive, long-tailed pterosaurs ("rhamphorhynchoids"), such as Rhamphorhynchus, the average growth rate {{during the first}} year of life was 130% to 173%, slightly faster than the growth rate of alligators. Growth in these species slowed after sexual maturity, and it would have <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> three years for Rhamphorhynchus to attain maximum size. In contrast, the more advanced, large pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as Pteranodon, grew to adult size within the first year of life. Additionally, pterodactyloids had determinate growth, meaning that the animals reached a fixed maximum adult size and stopped growing.|$|E

Due to the inability of units of the British First Army to link up with the Pont Du Fahs force, the 2nd Parachute Battalion, under Lieutenant Colonel John Frost, was forced to retreat over fifty miles towards the nearest Allied units; it was attacked {{several times during the}} retreat, and although it reached Allied lines safely it had <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 250 casualties.|$|E
5|$|After her {{sentencing}} Green {{continued to}} maintain that her recall of {{the night of the}} fire was limited. In the summer of 1996, she wrote to her daughter claiming that she had <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the recommended doses of her medications that night. Similar letters to Michael Farrar varied from claims that she had no recollection of the night to firmly stating that she was innocent of the arson. She theorized that Margaret Hacker had set fire to the family's house, and reiterated her claim from the show-cause hearing that Tim had been the one to poison his father. Green wrote to author Ann Rule in 1996 asserting that, due to alcohol abuse, she had not had the mental capacity to start a fire. In a later interview with Rule, she blamed her cloudy thinking during the court hearings on her Prozac prescription, and stated that once she was off the drug, her mind became much clearer.|$|E
5|$|Like Leyland, the Yorkshire bowler Roy Kilner coached in India during 1927–28. However, {{in doing}} so Kilner {{contracted}} a fever and died shortly after returning to England. With a weakened bowling attack, and affected by injuries and loss of form, Yorkshire pressed Leyland into service as an occasional bowler in the 1928 season. He had done little bowling for Yorkshire at this point; the team possessed two slow left-arm spinners in Kilner and Rhodes, leaving Leyland with little opportunity. Having never bowled 50 first-class overs in a previous season, nor <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> four wickets, he bowled over 500 overs in 1928 and took 35 wickets {{at an average of}} 34.20. At this stage, the Yorkshire authorities thought that he might fully take on Kilner's bowling workload, or succeed Rhodes in the senior spinner's position.|$|E

5|$|Shane Warne, {{a retired}} {{international}} Australian cricketer, took {{a number of}} five-wicket hauls during his career for Australia. In cricket, a five-wicket haul - {{also known as a}} five-for or fifer- refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and only four bowlers have <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 30 five-wicket hauls in their Test cricket careers. Warne has the second-most five-wicket hauls in Test cricket with 37, behind Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan. Despite this he has only taken a single five-wicket haul in One Day Internationals (ODI). He {{is one of the most}} experienced Australian cricketers, and the second leading wicket taker in Test cricket history with 708 wickets, again behind Muralitharan. He is twelfth on the all-time list of ODI wicket takers. In 2000, Warne was named fourth of five Wisden Cricketers of the Century behind Sir Donald Bradman, Sir Garfield Sobers and Sir Jack Hobbs.|$|E
5|$|Sydney Barnes was a {{professional}} cricketer who played for England in 27 Test matches between 1901 and 1914. He claimed 24 five-wicket hauls (five or more wickets in an innings) during his Test career. A five-wicket haul {{is regarded as a}} notable achievement, and as of 2014 fewer than 50 bowlers have <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. Barnes had only played seven first-class matches when he was chosen by Archie MacLaren to tour Australia, and played only 47 County Championship matches throughout his entire career, opting to play Minor Counties and Lancashire League cricket instead. He based his decision upon two main criteria– playing club cricket was more financially rewarding, and he was worried about having to bowl too much in first-class county cricket, and suffering from burnout.|$|E
5|$|A {{player has}} taken two hat-tricks {{in the same}} Test match only once. Playing for Australia against South Africa in the first match of the 1912 Triangular Tournament at Old Trafford, Manchester, England, leg spinner Jimmy Matthews took a hat-trick in South Africa's first and second innings, both taken on 28 May 1912. He {{completed}} both hat-tricks by dismissing South Africa's Tommy Ward. Only three other cricketers have <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one Test hat-trick: Australian off spinner Hugh Trumble (two years apart, between the same teams at the same ground), Pakistani fast bowler Wasim Akram (just over a week apart, in consecutive matches between the same teams) and English fast bowler Stuart Broad. Three players have taken a hat-trick on their Test debut: English medium pace bowler Maurice Allom in 1930, New Zealand off-spinner Peter Petherick in 1976, and Australian pace bowler Damien Fleming in 1994. Geoff Griffin took the fewest total Test wickets of any player who recorded a hat-trick, taking only eight wickets in his entire Test career. During the match in which he took his hat-trick, Griffin was repeatedly called for throwing by the umpires and never bowled again in a Test match. Australian Peter Siddle is the only bowler to take a hat-trick on his birthday, and Bangladeshi off spinner Sohag Gazi is the only player to score a century and take a hat-trick in the same Test match.|$|E
