5|$|After the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, Scottish peers, {{including}} {{those who did not}} sit as representative peers, were excluded from the House of Commons. Irish peers were more favoured and not subjected to the same restrictions. Irish members not nominated as representative peers were allowed to serve in Parliament as representatives of a constituencies in Great Britain, although not in Ireland, provided <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> their privileges as a peer. Lord Curzon, for example, specifically requested an Irish peerage so he would not be debarred from sitting in the House of Commons.|$|E
5|$|There is no firm {{documentary}} evidence of {{occupation of the}} Webster County village after 1809. However, analysis of pottery and glass beads suggests that the site was re-occupied during the second decade of the 19th century; and three letters from 1823 and 1825 suggest that the Kitkehahki were living on the Republican. By 1833, however, the village had been abandoned and the band was living on the Loup River. In that year, the four Pawnee bands, treated as a single tribe by the U.S. government, signed a treaty in which <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> their lands south of the Platte.|$|E
5|$|The Mustangs were defensively {{anchored}} by senior defensive end Margus Hunt, who achieved eight sacks {{en route to}} a first-team all-conference selection. Prior to the game, there was significant hype surrounding the defensive matchup between Fresno State's Davante Adams and SMU's cornerback junior Kenneth Acker, who intercepted the ball three times during the season. Acker achieved second-team all-conference accolades. SMU's defense also had an all-conference honoree in the linebacking corps, senior Ja'Gared Davis, who totaled 77 tackles during the season. The Mustangs were prolific in turnovers and led the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) in interceptions returned for touchdowns (8), tied for fourth in interceptions (21), and finished third in total takeaways (37). Despite their success with turnovers, the Mustangs were far more mediocre in scoring defense, in which they allowed 25.7 points per game (tied for 54th nationally), and total defense, in which <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> 396.1 yards per game (62nd nationally).|$|E

5|$|The last-place New York Red Bulls {{defeated}} Toronto FC 5–0 in {{the final}} 2009 regular season game, leaving TFC one point out of the playoffs. Despite bringing in some high-profile talent, the Reds could not seem to field a consistent side. Dwayne De Rosario became an immediate scoring influence and Amado Guevara was a strong playmaker and established MLS veteran, but the Honduran's future at the Canadian club seemed murky with looming 2010 FIFA World Cup duties. Rookie goalkeeper Stefan Frei quickly replaced Greg Sutton as a regular starter and immediately became a fan favourite. TFC only scored two goals {{in the final}} 15 minutes of games all season (last in MLS). During the same 15-minute period <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> 16 goals (most in MLS), thus creating a −14 goal differential during the final 15 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{previous}} season, Halla lost the opening game against High1. However, they once again found themselves on top at {{the midpoint of}} the season. The team was second in the league in goals scored with 65. Halla retained Dustin Wood who was brought in as a replacement in {{the previous}} season. On 14 November 2010 the team defended their Korea Domestic Championship title against High1 by defeating them 5–1 in the final game of the week-long tournament. After finishing first two consecutive years, Halla finished in fourth place one point behind the Free Blades. They won their season series against all teams except the Cranes and Eagles. They also finished fifth in goals scored with 130, one behind High1, but allowed the second fewest goals with 94, three behind the Eagles. While the team's penalty kill was ranked fifth in the league, they were tied for the most short-handed goals with the Cranes with six goals. Their powerplay was ranked third, and <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> the second fewest short-handed goals. Brock Radunske led the team with 20 goals and finished fourth in the league. Cho Min-ho also made the top ten ranking and finished in eight place with 18 goals. Kim Ki-sung was the only Halla player to make the top ten in assists and finished in tenth place with 27. Overall Cho Min-ho led the team with 44 points and finished ninth in the league. Dustin Wood led the team in penalty minutes with 45. With their fourth-place finish, Halla had to face the Eagles {{in the first round of}} the playoffs. The series began in Japan, but Halla took two of three games and upon returning to South Korea they won the fourth game of the best-of-five series and knocked the Eagles out. The Free Blades defeated the Cranes and Halla were set to face them on 12 March 2011 in Sendai, Japan. However, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck the Sendai area about one hour after the team landed there to prepare for the games. The League immediately cancelled the three games scheduled in Sendai and on 22 March 2011 they officially cancelled the final series, award co-championship titles to both Anyang Halla and Tohoku Free Blades. This decision made Halla only the second team to capture back-to-back championships since the league's inception.|$|E

25|$|A folktale from Tlaxcala {{tells how}} some hunters saw an {{enormous}} black dog {{one night and}} decided to capture and keep it.

25|$|The Sharks rode on a {{very hot}} streak {{in the month of}} March. They were aided by the trade-deadline {{acquisition}} of Brian Campbell, for whom <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> Steve Bernier. Going the entire month without a regulation loss, the Sharks captured their third Pacific Division title with a franchise-record 108 points. San Jose started the 2008 playoffs beating the Calgary Flames four games to three in San Jose's first-ever Game 7 on home ice. San Jose eventually lost to the Dallas Stars in the Western Conference Semi-finals. Game 6 required four overtime periods, and was the longest game in the team's history. This was the Sharks third playoff loss to Dallas.|$|E
25|$|The Tar Heels {{turned the}} ball over 6 times in their 59–38 loss to Clemson. This was the most points allowed by UNC since <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> 69 to Louisville in 2005. UNC was only down by 7 going into the half and their defense had only allowed 15 yards of rushing up to that point. However, Clemson's 35 points {{in the third quarter}} became {{only the second time in}} school history to {{accomplish}} this feat, the only other time being by the 1981 National Championship team.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the fourteenth century the Ottomans rose to predominance in Asia Minor, and developed an empire that subjugated most of the Arab Islamic world as well as south-eastern Europe. The Ottomans patronized Persian literature for five and a half centuries and, because Asia Minor was more stable than eastern territories, they attracted great numbers of writers and artists, especially in the sixteenth century. The Ottomans developed distinctive styles of arts and letters. Unlike Persia they gradually shed some of their Persianate qualities. <b>They</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> Persian as the court language, using Turkish instead; a decision that shocked the highly Persianized Mughals in India.|$|E
25|$|A {{long time}} ago some young lads herded sheep on Hesselberg. At that {{time there was a}} deep cave on the mountain, which is buried today. Bursting with curiosity they wanted to know what was inside. One of them was lowered by rope down into the deep hole. Beforehand the boys had decided to pull him up {{immediately}} when he gave a tug on the rope. Soon after the boy went into the cave, a three-legged rabbit hobbled across the way, the other lads followed it spontaneously in order to catch it, but the farther they chased the faster the rabbit ran. Finally <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up.</b> When they returned to the cave they remembered their fellow in the hole and they immediately pulled the rope up. It was stained with blood and at its end there hung a goat's hoof, but the boy was gone forever.|$|E

Luongo, who {{had a history of}} struggling against the Blackhawks, was pulled in Games 4 and 5; he also began Game 6 on the bench in favour of Cory Schneider before returning as the starter in Game 7. In the deciding game, Vancouver held a 1–0 lead with less than two minutes remaining in regulation when <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> a shorthanded goal to Chicago captain Jonathan Toews.
