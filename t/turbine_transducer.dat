40|$|Purpose of work {{is finding}} a {{rational}} spatial form of the sensitive element for measuring flow rate <b>turbine</b> <b>transducer,</b> which provides the best dynamic performance. To reach the goal got analytical description of the inertia moments for four sensitive elements with different spatial forms which allowed investigation of dynamic characteristics with developed software. As experiments result have been defined time constants for each sensitive element {{in the range of}} measured flow rates, estimated spatial forms for sensing elements according to the law of change the time constant. Research has shown traditional turbine with coaxial ring mounted on the average radius has the best dynamic characteristics in the operating range of flow rates. Prospects for further research is to evaluate the combined effect of various factors on the flow transducer dynamic characteristics. ????? ?????? ???????? ????? ???????????? ???????????????? ????? ??????????????? ???????? ?????????????? ??????????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????, ??? ??????? ?????????????? ????????? ???????????? ??????????????. ??? ?????????? ???? ???????? ????????????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ?????????????? ????????? ????????? ???????????????? ????, ??? ??????? ?? ??? ?????????? ?????????? ??????? ? ?????? ?? ????????? ? ????????? ?????????? ????????. ??????????? ???????????? ????????, ??? ? ??????? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ????????????? ???????????????? ???????? ??????????????? ? ?????????????? ?????????, ??????? ???????????? ????? ???????????? ???????? ? ???????????? ???????, ????????????? ?? ??????? ???????. ???????????? ?????????? ???????????? ???????? ?????? ???????????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ?? ???????????? ?????????????? ??????????????? ???????...|$|E
40|$|A {{portable}} {{peak flow}} meter based on a <b>turbine</b> <b>transducer</b> that can display results in code has been developed. Its performance compares well with the Wright {{peak flow meter}}. Records of subjective self assessment of asthma on a visual analogue scale and of peak flow (PEF) were compared in 12 subjects with asthma. PEF measurements were made with a coded meter for two weeks and an uncoded meter for two weeks in random order. The correlation between visual analogue scale score and PEF was invariably stronger when PEF was known. Changes in perception of asthma were measured by comparing the slopes and relative positions of the regressions of visual analogue on PEF. When PEF was uncoded awareness of asthma was significantly increased in five patients, predominantly those whose perception was poorest while they were using the coded meter, and decreased in only one patient. In two patients the results were unsuitable {{for this type of}} analysis. Knowledge of PEF therefore may influence subjective self assessment in patients with bronchial asthma. For objective studies of symptoms of asthma, PEF readings should be unknown to the patient. Perception of asthma may, however, be improved in patients with poor ability to detect changes in bronchial calibre by uncoded measurement of peak flow at home...|$|E

40|$|Disadvantages of the {{existing}} <b>turbine</b> flow rate <b>transducers</b> for fluids which can limit using devices based on it were analyzed. Reviewed methods of medium?s force action reducing to transducer?s bearings. Developed methods classification for reducing force impact of measured flow to sensitive elements of turbine type flow rate transducers. A comparative analysis of these methods was done. The direction for future research is related to creation of turbine type flow rate transducers with full force impact compensation which can enhance the effectiveness of such devices for wide range flow measurement, especially in the low flow rates with high repeatability. ? ?????? ???????????????? ?????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????????????? ??????? ?????????, ?????????????? ??????? ?????????? ???????? ?? ?? ??????. ??????????? ?????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????? ?????????? ????? ?? ??????? ???? ????????? ????????????????. ??????????? ????????????? ??????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????? ??????????? ?????? ?? ?????????????? ??????? ????????? ???????????????? ??????? ?????????. ????????? ????????????? ?????? ????????? ???????. ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????? ? ????????? ????????? ???????????????? ??????? ? ?????? ???????????? ???????? ???????????, ??? ???????? ??????????? ???????? ????????????? ?????????? ????? ???????? ??? ????????? ??????? ? ??????? ?????????, ???????? ? ??????? ????? ????????, ? ??????? ??????????????...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{creating}} devices with turbine primary flow rate transducers, where the sensitive element is {{balanced by the}} flow of the liquid, which prevents the rapid deterioration of the sensor support and the loss of the metrological characteristics, is considered. The authors proposed the construction of a primary <b>turbine</b> flow rate <b>transducer</b> with a hydrodynamic sensitive element balancing; a characteristic feature is the presence of the sensitive element axial movement to determine that the analytical dependence, thereby creating a coherent mathematical model generalizes the considered converter. The method of determining the force balancing sensitive element {{in a wide range of}} flow rates is described. The influences of the dimensions, number and location of installation of fairings towards the flow axis, the distance between them, as well as liquid hydrodynamic and physical characteristics, on the transducer parameters were studied. ? ?????? ??????????????? ?????? ???????? ???????? ? ?????????? ?????????? ????????????????? ???????, ??? ?????????????? ??????? ???????????????? ??????? ?????????? ????????, ??? ????????????? ??????? ????? ???? ??????????????? ???????? ? ?????? ??????????????? ?????????????. ???????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ??????? ? ????????????????? ???????????????? ??????????????? ????????. ????????? ???????????? ??????? ?? ?????? ??????????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ????????, ????????, ?????????? ? ????? ????????? ??????????? ?? ????????? ? ??? ??????, ?????????? ????? ????, ? ????? ????????????????? ? ?????????? ????????????? ?????????? ????????...|$|R

40|$|A John Deere farm tractor model 4430 H was {{instrumented}} {{to monitor}} forward velocity, slip, area operated by implement, rate of fuel consumption, total fuel consumption, theoretical field time and total field time. Two magnetic pickups {{each with a}} ferrous gear were used to monitor the angular velocity of the right front and rear wheels. The fuel consumption was monitored with a single <b>turbine</b> flow <b>transducer.</b> An intermediate float tank system was used to accommodate the return fuel from the injector pump and injectors. A micro switch was also used to detect the operating position of the implement. The transducers attached to the tractor did not require any major alteration of the tractor system or restrict its operation;A single board microcomputer tractor performance monitor based on Intel 8035 single chip microcomputer was developed to monitor the inputs of the transducers and controls and to calculate and display {{the values of the}} monitored parameters. The developed tractor performance monitor had the following capabilities: (1) 2048 8 -bit words of program memory; (2) 64 8 -bit words of data memory; (3) one 8 -bit data input port; (4) two 3 -digit and three 2 -digit displays; (5) single step unit; (6) single 5 -volt power supply; and (7) expansion capabilities with (i) 2048 8 -bit words of program memory, (ii) 256 8 -bit words of data memory, and (iii) virtually unlimited input/output ports;The instrumented tractor was tested with a chisel plow and a tandem disc harrow in a slightly wet combine harvested corn field. All the transducers functioned properly and proved to be reliable under field conditions. The system also was easy and simple to use without restricting operator movement. The operator starts and stops the data acquisition of the monitor with an easily-reached switch...|$|R
