5|$|One of the Prussian playing-for-time {{requests}} to the Patriotic Party was {{that before the}} treaty is signed, <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> more reforms within the Commonwealth government. In October 1789, the changing international situation (primarily the military defeats of the Ottoman Empire) suddenly and temporarily increased {{the value of an}} alliance with Poland for Prussia. In the meantime, the previously anti-royalist Patriotic Party has begun drifting closer to the king. In February and March 1790, concrete proposals were exchanged between Warsaw and Berlin. Some difficulties were centered around Prussian demands for the cession of Gdańsk and Toruń, and tariffs, but a threat of a Polish-Austrian alliance, recently brought forward by Austria, caused Prussia to withdraw most of the demands the Polish side was finding difficult to accept.|$|E

Shawn talks with Lacey Maxwell (Christine Chatelain), the sister of the groom, who asks him to get her bouquet from a locked cooler, but he can't. Before the wedding, the bouquets are passed out, and Lacey panics when hers isn't there. Lacey reveals she is a magician when she helps to calm down the flower girl. Shawn realizes who stole the ring and killed Manheim, but his realization occurs in the middle of the ceremony. Shawn interrupts the wedding with a [...] "psychic episode", and exposes Lacey to everyone.|$|E

50|$|NETRA can {{be thought}} as a {{thermometer}} for visual performance.

The need for accessible, low cost eye diagnostics like NETRA is tremendous and is global in scale—over half a billion people have uncorrected refractive errors.|$|E

50|$|The {{family doctor}} {{who failed to}} {{recognise}} the signs had already been suspended by the GMC four years before, due to his falling below the minimum standard {{to the extent that}} he was exposing patients to risk.

Foreman and Thirteen agree that <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if Seth's voice is hoarse to diagnose it. They take out Seth's breathing tube to test him, but they find that he chewed tobacco. Foreman explains that the tobacco released toxins that suppressed his immune system. When Seth stopped chewing, the lack of toxins brought out sarcoidosis. They start Seth on treatment. Seth's condition improves, and, despite his protests, his mother decides to implant the cochlear device in him again.|$|E

Although Joel, {{who works as a}} mechanic in the family garage, is wary of Lauryn's decision to enroll, he eventually gives her his blessing.

5000|$|In 1907, an American detective by {{the name}} of Thomas Furlong was {{employed}} by Enrique Creel, at that time governor of Chihuahua, to locate Mexican dissidents in the U.S. The American headquarters of the PLM was in St. Louis at that time. There were a large number of expatriates who knew of its whereabouts and as a result, Furlong had no difficulty locating the dissidents in the city. Magón, however, was living in great secrecy in Los Angeles. He used a pseudonym, and only two other persons in the city knew his real identity. If <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him, <b>they</b> did so between midnight and dawn. [...] The dissidents in St. Louis soon became aware that they were being sought by agents working for the Mexican government. Librado Rivera left the city in order to evade capture and although he was constantly on alert for agents who might be shadowing him, he failed to elude them. He was followed to Los Angeles and to Magón's place of residence. Furlong kept the house under surveillance for some time. Finally, on August 23, 1907, Magón, Rivera and Antonio Villarreal were taken into custody by Furlong, two of his assistants and some officers from the Los Angeles police department.|$|R

While talking with this woman, Michael refers to Lincoln as a business associate. Michael asks if she has a phone that he can use, and she replies affirmatively. As Michael asks for international assistance to call Sara, Lincoln presses the receiver, and says that making such a call is dangerous.|$|E

After {{nighttime}} falls and the whole place is decorated with lights, Cheerilee gave Lily Lightly the title [...] "Princess of All that Twinkles and Glows", but her horn starts to glow and then runs off, leaving some of the ponies confused.

40|$|Background: In the {{aftermath}} of the Tsunami disaster in 2004, an online psychological self-assessment (ONSET) was developed and made available by the University of Zurich in order to provide an online screening instrument for Tsunami victims to test if they were traumatized and in need of mental health care. The objective {{of the study was to}} report the lessons learnt that were made using an Internet-based, self-screening instrument after a largescale disaster and to discuss its outreach and usefulness. Methods: Users of the online self-assessment decided after finishing the procedure whether their dataset could be used for quality control and scientific evaluation Their answers were stored anonymously only if they consented (which was the case in 88 % of the sample), stratified analyses according to level of exposure were conducted. Results: A total of 2, 914 adult users gave their consent for analysis of the screenings. Almost three quarter of the sample filled out the ONSET questionnaire within the first four weeks. Forty-one percent of the users reported direct exposure to the Tsunami disaster. Users who were injured by the Tsunami and users who reported dead or injured family members showed the highest degree of PTSD symptoms. Conclusion: ONSET was used by a large number of subjects who thought to be affected by the catastrophe in order to help them decide if <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a mental health professional.
