There is a fan on the floor, and a plant bearing white flowers on the right. The fan is an oriental element, and {{an expression of the}} artistic trend known as Japonisme which was then prevalent in European art. At the time, Whistler was greatly influenced by his friend and colleague Albert Joseph Moore. The painting bears close resemblances to Moore's roughly contemporary painting , though at the time the two were working so closely together <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> ascertain exactly who influenced whom.|$|E
25|$|Some writers {{argue for}} an {{accounting}} concept {{of interest to}} evaluate projects and investments. As a tool for comparing projects with countries where the interest rate is operated, however, it is argued <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> see why a profit rate cannot be used.|$|E
25|$|But {{the future}} of BRIC as an economy group is questionable. In 2012, a book with the title 'Breakout Nations' {{mentioned}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> sustain rapid growth {{for more than a}} decade.

Historically, Jim O'Neill who coined the term of BRIC was the former chief economist of Goldman Sachs. The head of emerging markets for Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Ruchir Sharma has released a book in 2012: Breakout Nations which mentioned <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> sustain rapid growth {{for more than a}} decade.|$|E
25|$|Linguistic {{competence}} involves communicating {{effectively with}} diverse populations, including individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP), low literacy skills {{or are not}} literate, disabilities, and individuals {{with any degree of}} hearing loss. According to the U.S. Census in 2011, 25.3 million people are considered limited English proficient, accounting for 9% of the U.S. population. Hospitals frequently admit LEP patients for treatment. With cultural and linguistic barriers, it is not surprising <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> achieve effective communication between the health care providers and the LEP patients.|$|E
25|$|In {{slightly}} under 32° S. Lat. {{there is}} a large island, at about 3 miles' distance from the mainland of the South-land; this island has high mountains, with a good deal of brushwood and many thornbushes, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> go over; here certain animals are found, since we saw many excrements, and besides two seals and a wild cat, resembling a civet-cat, but with browner hair. This island is dangerous to touch at, owing to the rocky reefs which are level with the water and below the surface, almost along the whole length of the shore; between it and the mainland there are also numerous rocks and reefs, and slightly more to southward {{there is a}}nother small island.|$|E

25|$|Hunter, unlike Slide, {{was located}} close to {{settlements}} and saw considerable exploitation of its forest resources. Retired Colonel William Edwards {{was so successful}} harvesting hemlock bark for tanning during the mid-19th century {{in what is now}} the ski area that not only was the ridge named the Colonel's Chair in his honor, the village of Hunter was briefly renamed Edwardsville. On {{the other side of the}} mountain, the West Virginia-based Fenwick Lumber Company logged Hunter and Southwest Hunter so thoroughly between 1903 and 1917 <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find virgin forest anywhere in the lands they once owned. Some of the roads and railroads they built on the mountains still serve as trails today, and other remnants of their operations are in the nearby woods.|$|E
25|$|Singing is an {{integrated}} and coordinated act {{and it is}} difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in, intensively, on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} {{in what ways}} silica is {{important}} in the nutrition of animals. This field of research is challenging because silica is ubiquitous and in most circumstances dissolves in trace quantities only. All the same it certainly does occur in the living body, leaving us with the problem <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> create proper silica-free controls for purposes of research. This makes it difficult to be sure when the silica present has had operative beneficial effects, and when its presence is coincidental, or even harmful. The current consensus is that it certainly seems important in the growth, strength, and management of many connective tissues. This is true not only for hard connective tissues such as bone and tooth but possibly in the biochemistry of the subcellular enzyme-containing structures as well.|$|E

60|$|A very trivial {{circumstance}} {{will serve}} to exemplify this. Suppose {{you go into}} a fruiterer's shop, wanting an apple,--you take up one, and, on biting it, you find <b>it</b> <b>is</b> sour; you look at <b>it,</b> and see <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> and green. You take up another one, and that too <b>is</b> <b>hard,</b> green, and sour. The shopman offers you a third; but, before biting it, you examine <b>it,</b> and find <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> and green, and you immediately say that you will not have it, as <b>it</b> must <b>be</b> sour, like those that you have already tried.|$|R
25|$|Jewish {{historians have}} stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> {{describe}} the national sense {{of shock and}} trauma that set in when the masses of Jews {{all over the world}} learned that someone as famous as Sabbatai Zevi had officially abandoned his faith for Islam. However, the fact remains that Zevi is the most famous Jew to have become a Muslim, which is also what the term Sabbatean has come to denote. Many within Zevi's inner circle followed him into Islam, including his wife Sarah and most of his closest relatives and friends. Nathan of Gaza, the scholar closest to Zevi, who had caused Zevi to reveal his Messiahship and in turn became his prophet, never followed his master into Islam but remained a Jew, albeit excommunicated by his Jewish brethren.|$|E

In 1954 he formed a partnership with Francis Sams, specializing in corporate law. Over the next decade, he established himself as one of Miami's most prominent attorneys. In 1966, the Miami News called him [...] "Dade's knight" [...] and wrote of him that [...] "the name Dan Paul comes up in so many civic controversies <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> keep up with him". Paul eventually became known as [...] "the father of Metro".|$|E

In a review of that episode, which aired around Halloween in 2003, Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> tell Frink and his father's voices apart: [...] "Azaria voices Frink with such a spot-on Lewis imitation that it's sometimes hard to tell which one of the two nutty professors is talking." [...] In addition, The Knoxville News-Sentinels Terry Morrow commented that [...] "to hear Lewis doing Azaria doing Lewis is a mind-bending gut buster, the kind of pay-off that die-hard Simpsons fans live for." ...|$|E

500|$|The Simpsons writer Tom Martin said in Ortved's {{book that}} he does not {{understand}} the criticism against Scully because he thinks Scully ran the show well. He also commented that he thinks the criticism [...] "bothered , and still bothers him, but he managed to not get worked up over it." [...] Ortved noted in his book <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> tell how much of the decline is Scully's fault, and that blaming a single show runner for lowering the quality of the show [...] "is unfair." [...] He also wrote that some of the episodes from Scully's first two seasons (nine and ten), such as [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] and [...] "When You Dish Upon a Star", are better than certain episodes of the two previous seasons.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{the release}} of It Won't Be Soon Before Long, music critics commented on the {{original}} version of the song, which does not include guest vocals by Rihanna. Jerome Blakeney for BBC wrote that [...] "If I Never See Your Face Again", along with another It Won't Be Soon Before Long track [...] "Makes Me Wonder", were [...] "monster weapons of mass-marketing aimed at the feet and riding on swathes of string-drenched, synth-crunching disco." [...] A reviewer for IGN was complimentary of 'If I Never See Your Face Again', writing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> resist listening to the song. The reviewer also noted that Levine appeared to adopt a vocal style reminiscent of techniques employed by Justin Timberlake, writing [...] "Like Justin Timberlake it's all about the high pitched tenor falsetto and some sinewy grooves." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in the International Times, Barry Miles found [...] "Piggies" [...] "unsubtle" [...] {{and likely}} to appeal to [...] "those {{involved}} with Chicago's pig-police". William Mann of The Times noted the recurring nature theme throughout the album, from brief mentions of monkeys, lizards, elephants and tigers, to song titles such as [...] "Blackbird" [...] and [...] "Piggies", and asked of Harrison's characters: [...] "are they Chicago police or just company directors?" [...] Melody Makers Alan Walsh admired the instrumentation on the recording and deemed [...] "Piggies" [...] to be [...] "The Beatles' satire track … a kick at upper-class reactionaries or journalists (or both)". In his unfavourable review of the White Album, in The New York Times, Mike Jahn considered {{that many of the}} tracks were [...] "either so corny or sung in such a way <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> tell whether [...] are being serious", among which the words of Harrison's song served as [...] "an act of lyrical overstatement".|$|E

500|$|Many of the 'letters' {{were never}} posted, and were written {{especially}} for the book. Patrick Armstrong, in his book The English Parson-Naturalist, notes that in particular, [...] "an obvious example is the first, nominally to Thomas Pennant, but which is clearly contrived, as it introduces the parish, briefly summarizing its position, geography and principal physical features." [...] White's biographer, Richard Mabey, estimates that up to 46 out of 66 'letters to Daines Barrington' [...] "were probably never sent through the post"; Mabey explains <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> be more precise, because of White's extensive editing. Some letters are dated although never sent. Some dates have been altered. Some letters have been cut down, split into shorter 'letters', merged, or distributed in small parts into other letters. A section about insect-eating birds in a letter sent to Barrington in 1770 appears in the book as letter 41 to Pennant. Personal remarks have been removed throughout. Thus, while the book is genuinely based on letters to Pennant and Barrington, {{the structure of the}} book is a literary device.|$|E
500|$|Despite this, Scully's {{tenure as}} showrunner of The Simpsons {{has been the}} subject of {{criticism}} from the show's fans. John Ortved wrote [...] "Scully's episodes excel when compared to what The Simpsons airs nowadays, but he was the man at the helm when the ship turned towards the iceberg." [...] The BBC noted [...] "the common consensus is that The Simpsons golden era ended after season nine", while an op-ed in Slate by Chris Suellentrop argued The Simpsons changed from a realistic show about family life into a typical cartoon during Scully's years. The Simpsons under Scully has been negatively labelled as a [...] "gag-heavy, Homer-centric incarnation" [...] by Jon Bonné of MSNBC, while some fans have bemoaned the transformation in Homer's character during the era, from sweet and sincere to [...] "a boorish, self-aggrandizing oaf", dubbing him [...] "Jerkass Homer". Martin said that he does not understand the criticism against Scully and that he thinks the criticism [...] "bothered , and still bothers him, but he managed to not get worked up over it." [...] Ortved noted in his book <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> tell how much of the decline is Scully's fault, and that blaming a single showrunner for lowering the quality of the show [...] "is unfair." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thompson of NPR Music {{called the}} song [...] "one of the decade's finest pop anthems" [...] which is infused with energy, {{charisma}} and full-throated intensity. Steve Lampiris of ZME Music opined that {{the song is}} [...] "one of very few perfect pop songs released {{in the last ten}} years," [...] stating <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> determine the principal reason that makes the song very successful. Gary Trust of Billboard thought that [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] is a defining song of the 2000s. He commented on its status as a blueprint for female pop songs, as seen in song productions by artists such as Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry and Pink. In 2014, Ryan Kailath of NPR Music argued that the song succeeded by borrowing from musical trends that preceded it, such as 1990s R and alternative rock. In 2015, Gary Trust of Billboard wrote that [...] "Kelly Clarkson's [...] "Since U Been Gone," [...] co-written by Max Martin, especially helped lead to pure pop's reemergence, and the breakthroughs of Rihanna, Katy Perry, [...] Swift and Lady Gaga would soon follow (as well as [...] Spears' own revival)", stating that the song [...] "began to erode hip-hop's early '00s reign, with women at the forefront of turning the tide".|$|E
