40|$|Recently, microblogging {{is widely}} studied by the {{researchers}} in <b>the</b> domain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> online social network (OSN). How to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>popularities</b> <b>of</b> microblogging users is an important research field, which {{can be applied to}} commercial advertising, user behavior analysis and information dissemination, and so forth. Previous studies on the evaluation methods cannot effectively solve and accurately evaluate <b>the</b> <b>popularities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microbloggers. In this paper, we proposed an electromagnetic field theory based model to analyze <b>the</b> <b>popularities</b> <b>of</b> microbloggers. <b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> source in microblogging field is first put forward, which is based on <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> source in <b>the</b> electromagnetic field; then, one’s microblogging flux is calculated according to his/her behaviors (send or receive feedbacks) on the microblogging platform; finally, we used three methods to calculate one’s microblogging flux density, which can represent one’s <b>popularity</b> on <b>the</b> microblogging platform. In the experimental work, we evaluated our model using real microblogging data and selected the best one from <b>the</b> three <b>popularity</b> measure methods. We also compared our model with the classic PageRank algorithm; and the results show that our model is more effective and accurate to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>popularities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microbloggers...|$|R
