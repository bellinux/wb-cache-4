40|$|INTRODUCTION: Endovascular cooling is {{currently}} used for hypothermia treatment and fever reduction therapy. At the same time, {{little is known}} about the risks associated to endovascular cooling in patients <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> endovascular cooling catheter (ECC). METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 122 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ECC either for therapeutic hypothermia or for fever reduction was performed. ECC-associated thromboembolic events (TEE) such as pulmonary embolism and thrombosis were recorded and compared between patients <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ECC and patients <b>treated</b> only <b>with</b> <b>a</b> central venous line (CVL). Additionally, various laboratory parameters were recorded to determine if they might be related to the frequency of TEE's. RESULTS: 43 Patients were <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ECC and 79 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> CVL. Patients in the ECC group suffered more frequently from TEE (37...|$|R

5|$|HIV {{infections are}} usually <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{combination}} of antiviral drugs, each targeting a different {{stage in the}} virus's life-cycle.

The success of these drugs is proof of the importance of knowing how viruses reproduce.|$|E

5|$|Most {{people with}} {{hypothyroidism}} symptoms and confirmed thyroxine deficiency are <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> synthetic long-acting form of thyroxine, known as levothyroxine (L-thyroxine). In young and otherwise healthy people with overt hypothyroidism, a full replacement dose (adjusted by weight) can be started immediately; {{in the elderly}} and people with heart disease a lower starting dose is recommended to prevent over supplementation and risk of complications. Lower doses may be sufficient in those with subclinical hypothyroidism, while people with central hypothyroidism may require a higher than average dose.|$|E

Rats <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single injection of niobium pentachloride or niobates show a median lethal dose (LD50) between 10 and 100mg/kg.

5|$|Between 1710 and 1713 {{a further}} {{restoration}} {{was carried out}} by the painter Annibale Mazzuoli and his son. They used sponges dipped in Greek wine which Colalucci suggests was necessitated by the accretion of grime caused by soot and dirt trapped in the oily deposits of the previous restoration. Mazzuoli then worked over the ceiling, according to Colalucci, strengthening the contrasts by overpainting details. They also repainted some areas the colours of which were lost because of the efflorescence of salts. Areas of repainting were hatched or <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> linear brushstroke. Colalucci states that Mazzuoli also applied a great deal of glue varnish. The restoration concentrated on the ceiling and less attention was paid to the lunettes.|$|E

5|$|Caroline's main rival for Mac's {{affections}} is Sue White (Michelle Gomez), the Scottish staff {{liaison officer}} employed {{to listen and}} respond to the problems of East Hampton's staff. However, Sue is perhaps the least suited person for the job; she is mean-spirited, insensitive, unsympathetic, controlling and vain. Her office is a place where the impossible tends to happen, and anyone who enters is normally <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mixture of verbal abuse and psychological torture, so she can get back to doing nothing, or thinking about how to upset the next visitor. The only person she treats with any affection is Mac, whom she loves to the point of madness, but Mac, like almost everyone else, tries his best to avoid her. Anyone who attempts to get involved with Mac is treated with contempt and hatred by Sue, in particular Caroline, whom Sue attempts several times to murder.|$|E
5|$|In {{uncomplicated}} cases, UTIs are <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> short {{course of}} antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Resistance {{to many of}} the antibiotics used to treat this condition is increasing. In complicated cases, a longer course or intravenous antibiotics may be needed. If symptoms do not improve in two or three days, further diagnostic testing may be needed. Phenazopyridine may help with symptoms. In those who have bacteria or white blood cells in their urine but have no symptoms, antibiotics are generally not needed, although during pregnancy is an exception. In those with frequent infections, a short course of antibiotics may be taken as soon as symptoms begin or long-term antibiotics may be used as a preventative measure.|$|E
5|$|This {{was not an}} {{encouraging}} start for the operation but despite this, the LCS decided {{to continue with the}} deception. Colonel Thornton's trip was approved and he travelled to Stockholm toward the end of April. Thornton spent two weeks in Sweden, meeting {{with the head of the}} Royal Swedish Air Force, General Bengt Nordenskiöld. The conferences were <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high degree of secrecy in the hope this would emphasise their importance. It had the required effect; Thornton's conversations were recorded by a pro-German chief of police and forwarded to Germany. Despite siding with the Allies, Nordenskiöld communicated very little sensitive information to Thornton. Nordenskiöld was convinced that the Allies intended to invade Norway, but he kept this conviction to himself, contrary to Allied hopes. Thornton returned to England on 30 April.|$|E
