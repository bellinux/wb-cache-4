5|$|In early 1992, radio astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} two planets orbiting <b>the</b> <b>pulsar</b> PSR 1257+12. This discovery was confirmed, and is {{generally considered to be}} the first definitive detection of exoplanets. These pulsar planets are believed to have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced <b>the</b> <b>pulsar,</b> in a second round of planet formation, or else to be the remaining rocky cores of giant planets that survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits.|$|E
5|$|Degenerate {{stars have}} {{contracted}} into a compact mass, {{resulting in a}} rapid rate of rotation. However they have relatively low rates of rotation compared to what would be expected by conservation of angular momentum—the tendency of a rotating body to compensate for a contraction in size by increasing its rate of spin. A {{large portion of the}} star's angular momentum is dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind. In spite of this, the rate of rotation for a pulsar can be very rapid. <b>The</b> <b>pulsar</b> {{at the heart of the}} Crab nebula, for example, rotates 30 times per second. The rotation rate of <b>the</b> <b>pulsar</b> will gradually slow due to the emission of radiation.|$|E
5|$|There {{are fewer}} records of {{supernova}} SN 1181, which {{occurred in the}} constellation Cassiopeia just over a century after SN 1054. It was noted by Chinese and Japanese astronomers, however. <b>The</b> <b>pulsar</b> 3C58 may be the stellar relic from this event.|$|E

50|$|MAGIC {{has found}} pulsed {{gamma-rays}} at energies higher than 25 GeV coming from <b>the</b> Crab <b>Pulsar.</b> <b>The</b> presence of such high energies {{indicates that the}} gamma-ray source is far out in <b>the</b> <b>pulsar's</b> magnetosphere, in contradiction with many models.|$|R
5|$|When Backer et al. {{reported}} their finding in November 1982, {{they found that}} the rotation period of PSR B1937+21 was increasing at a rate of 3 seconds per second. Pulsars are expected to slow over time, as the energy that they emit is ultimately drawn from the rotational energy of <b>the</b> <b>pulsar.</b> Using the initially observed values for the period and spin down rate, and assuming a minimum period of 0.5 milliseconds for pulsars, the maximum age for PSR B1937+21 was found to be about 750 years old. The estimate of the minimum possible period is obtained from the centrifugal break-up limit, which is the rotational period at which the centrifugal force and the self-gravity of <b>the</b> <b>pulsar</b> are equal. The value of the minimum rotational period depends upon the neutron star equation of state, with different models giving values between 0.3 and 1 millisecond, which corresponds to a rotation frequency of 1-3 kilohertz. There may be mechanisms such as gravitational radiation which keep <b>the</b> <b>pulsar</b> from reaching this absolute limit, but pulsars can spin no faster.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of planetary mass companions around PSR B1257+12 in 1990 by Aleksander Wolszczan, data for PSR B1937+21 and other pulsars were analyzed {{for the presence of}} similar companions. By 1994, an upper limit of about one thousandth of the mass of Earth was determined for any companion of PSR B1937+21 within 2 astronomical units. In 1999, Aleksander Wolszczan reported variations in the times of arrival of pulses from PSR B1937+21, as well as previous analysis by Tokio Fukushima which suggested that these timing variations could be caused by a dwarf planet around <b>the</b> <b>pulsar.</b> The data were consistent with a companion having a mass similar to Ceres and located at 2.71 astronomical units from <b>the</b> <b>pulsar,</b> but data {{over a longer period of}} time are required in order to verify the proposed companion. More recent observations have not detected any regular periodic signal associated with this companion, but argue that the slight variations in pulse arrival times are consistent with an asteroid belt having a total mass less than 0.05 that of the Earth, but acknowledge that the detection of periodicity in pulse timing variations associated with individual asteroids is necessary to confirm the possible asteroid belt.|$|E
5|$|Coma Berenices also {{contains}} the neutron star RBS 1223 and <b>the</b> <b>pulsar</b> PSR B1237+25. RBS 1223 {{is a member}} of the Magnificent Seven, a group of young neutron stars. In 1975, the first extra-solar source of extreme ultraviolet, the white dwarf HZ 43, was discovered in Coma Berenices. In 1995, there was a very rare outburst of the WZ Sagittae-type dwarf nova AL Comae Berenices. A June 2003 outburst from GO Comae Berenices, an SU Ursae Majoris-type dwarf nova, was photometrically observed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—It {{is shown}} that, when angular-momentum losses {{of a radio}} pulsar are {{represented}} as a sum of magnetic-dipole and current losses, the angle between the magnetic moment and rotation axis of <b>the</b> radio <b>pulsar</b> tends to some equilibrium value (near 45 ◦).

5|$|Gliese 876 d is an {{exoplanet}} approximately 15 {{light-years away}} in the constellation of Aquarius. The planet was the third planet discovered orbiting the red dwarf Gliese 876. At {{the time of its}} discovery, the planet had the lowest mass of any known extrasolar planet apart from <b>the</b> <b>pulsar</b> planets orbiting PSR B1257+12. Due to this low mass, it can be categorized as a super-Earth.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 has {{a notable}} orbital arrangement. It {{is the first}} {{planetary}} system around a normal star to have mutual inclination between planets measured without transits (previously the mutual inclination of the planets orbiting <b>the</b> <b>pulsar</b> PSR B1257+12 had been determined by measuring their gravitational interactions). Later measurements reduced {{the value of the}} mutual inclination, and in the latest four-planet models the incorporation mutual inclinations does not result in significant improvements relative to coplanar solutions.|$|E
5|$|In close {{binary star}} systems {{one of the}} stars can lose mass to a heavier companion. Accretion-powered pulsars may drive mass loss. The {{shrinking}} star can then become a planetary-mass object. An example is a Jupiter-mass object orbiting <b>the</b> <b>pulsar</b> PSR J1719-1438. These shrunken white dwarfs may become a helium planet or carbon planet.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{contribution}} of young pulsars, with characteristic ages of less than 106 yr, to the diffuse γ-ray emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).

5|$|Like {{nearly all}} extrasolar planets {{discovered}} prior to 2008, PSR B1620-26 b was originally detected through the Doppler shifts its orbit induces on {{radiation from the}} star it orbits (in this case, changes in the apparent pulsation period of <b>the</b> <b>pulsar).</b> In the early 1990s, a group of astronomers led by Donald Backer, who were studying {{what they thought was}} a binary pulsar, determined that a third object was needed to explain the observed Doppler shifts.

5|$|Pulsars are {{rotating}} {{neutron stars}} {{that have a}} magnetic field. A narrow beam of electromagnetic radiation is emitted from the poles of rotating pulsars.

5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, a binary system will emit {{gravitational}} waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, {{the distance between}} the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period. Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is too small to be observable. This is not the case for a close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from <b>the</b> <b>pulsar,</b> observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.|$|E

5|$|During one {{period of}} {{rotation}} for PSR B1937+21, there are two peaks observed, known as the pulse and interpulse. PSR B1937+21 is unusual among pulsars in that it occasionally produces pulses far brighter than an average pulse. Until 1995, the sole other pulsar known to produce giant pulses was the Crab pulsar, and by 2006, there were 11 pulsars that had been observed to produce giant pulses {{out of more than}} 1500 known pulsars. The giant pulses of PSR B1937+21 were first observed in 1984, shortly after its discovery, but difficulty in observing single pulses of PSR B1937+21 due to its fast period meant that the pulses were not studied in more depth until a decade after they were first observed. In more recent follow up observations, more giant pulses have been found. These giant pulses have been observed to occur at the trailing edge of both the pulse and interpulse. The duration of these giant pulses is short compared to the period of <b>the</b> <b>pulsar,</b> lasting on the order of 10 nanoseconds. The flux density of observed pulses is somewhat variable, but has been observed to be as high as 6.5 Wm−2Hz−1 (6.5 janskys). The brightness temperature of a pulse with such high flux density and such low duration exceeds 5 kelvins, making the pulses of PSR B1937+21 the brightest radio emission ever observed. PSR B1937+21 is intrinsically the most luminous millisecond pulsar. In addition to the radio pulses observed, pulses have been detected at x-ray wavelengths, which show the same pulse and interpulse pattern.|$|E
