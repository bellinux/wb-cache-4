25|$|It is {{important}} to achieve the right balance between the degree of structure and flexibility that {{is built into the}} learning process. Savery (1994) contends that the more structured the learning environment, the harder it is for <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> to construct meaning based on their conceptual understandings. A facilitator should structure the learning experience just enough {{to make sure that the}} students get clear guidance and parameters within which to achieve the learning objectives, yet the learning experience should be open and free enough to allow for <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> to discover, enjoy, interact and arrive at their own, socially verified version of truth.|$|E

It depends essentially on <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> traits and it is reflected in <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> emotional reaction. Consequently, it is important to detect <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> emotional reaction following the tutor’s intervention in order to personalize the feedback type. Our proposal consists of a methodology, based on machine learning technique, able to predict <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> emotional reaction starting from the analysis of descriptive variables of <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> current situation, such as: personality, motivation and tutor’s feedback type...|$|R

25|$|According to {{the social}} constructivist approach, {{instructors}} have {{to adapt to the}} role of facilitators and not teachers (Bauersfeld, 1995). Whereas a teacher gives a didactic lecture that covers the subject matter, a facilitator helps the learner to get to his or her own understanding of the content. In the former scenario the learner plays a passive role and in the latter scenario the learner plays {{an active role in the}} learning process. The emphasis thus turns away from the instructor and the content, and towards the learner (Gamoran, Secada, & Marrett, 1998). This dramatic change of role implies that a facilitator needs to display a totally different set of skills than that of a teacher (Brownstein 2001). A teacher tells, a facilitator asks; a teacher lectures from the front, a facilitator supports from the back; a teacher gives answers according to a set curriculum, a facilitator provides guidelines and creates the environment for the learner to arrive at his or her own conclusions; a teacher mostly gives a monologue, a facilitator is in continuous dialogue with <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> (Rhodes and Bellamy, 1999). A facilitator should also be able to adapt the learning experience 'in mid-air' by taking the initiative to steer the learning experience to where <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> want to create value.|$|E
25|$|Second-language {{acquisition}} classroom {{research is}} an area of research in second-language acquisition concerned with how people learn languages in educational settings. There is a significant overlap between classroom research and language education. Classroom research is empirical, basing its findings on data and statistics wherever possible. It is also more concerned with what <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> do in the classroom than with what the teacher does. Where language teaching methods may only concentrate on the activities the teacher plans for the class, classroom research concentrates on the effect the things the teacher does has on the students.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} pedagogical agents to use <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> attention to detect motivation factors of <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> in interactive learning envi-ronments. This model is based on observations from human tutors coaching students in on-line learning tasks. It takes into account <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> focus of at-tention, current task, and expected time required to perform the task. A Bayesian model is used to combine evidence from <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> eye gaze and interface actions to infer <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> focus of attention. Then {{the focus of attention}} is combined with information about <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> activities, inferred by a plan recognizer, to detect <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> degree of confidence, confusion and effort. Finally, we discuss the results of an empirical study that we performed to evaluate our model. ...|$|R
30|$|For example, <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> {{model in}} Lessard (2012) aimed at {{creating}} {{a representation of}} learner’s cognitive traits. To do that, the study established connections between the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> and his/her actions in the game. Specifically, the manifestations of traits that <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> may exhibit during game-play were identified. This could provide evidence of <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> cognitive abilities.|$|R
25|$|Dogme {{language}} teaching {{is considered to}} be both a methodology and a movement. Dogme is a communicative approach to {{language teaching}} and encourages teaching without published textbooks and instead focusing on conversational communication among <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> and the teacher. It has its roots in an article by the language education author, Scott Thornbury. The Dogme approach is also referred to as “Dogme ELT”, which reflects its origins in the ELT (English language teaching) sector. Although Dogme language teaching gained its name from an analogy with the Dogme 95 film movement (initiated by Lars von Trier), the connection is not considered close.|$|E
25|$|A further {{characteristic}} {{of the role of}} the facilitator in the social constructivist viewpoint, is that the instructor and <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> are equally involved in learning from each other as well (Holt and Willard-Holt 2000). This means that the learning experience is both subjective and objective and requires that the instructor's culture, values and background become an essential part of the interplay between learners and tasks in the shaping of meaning. Learners compare their version of the truth with that of the instructor and fellow learners to get to a new, socially tested version of truth (Kukla 2000). The task or problem is thus the interface between the instructor and the learner (McMahon 1997). This creates a dynamic interaction between task, instructor and learner. This entails that learners and instructors should develop an awareness of each other's viewpoints and then look to their own beliefs, standards and values, thus being both subjective and objective at the same time (Savery 1994).|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} educational approach {{informed by}} cognitive flexibility is hypertext, which is frequently computer-supported instruction. Computers allow for complex {{data to be}} presented in a multidimensional and coherent format, allowing users to access that data as needed. The most widely used example of hypertext is the Internet, which dynamically presents information in terms of interconnection (e.g. hyperlinks). Hypertext documents, therefore, include nodes – bits of information – and links, the pathways between these nodes. Applications for teacher education have involved teacher-training sessions based on video instruction, whereby novice teachers viewed footage of master teachers conducting a literacy workshop. [...] In this example, the novice teachers received a laserdisc of the course content, a hypertext document that allowed <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> to access content in a self-directed manner. These [...] (CFH) provide a “three-dimensional” and “open-ended” representation of material for learners, enabling them to incorporate new information and form connections with preexisting knowledge. While {{further research is needed}} to determine the efficacy of CFH as an instructional tool, classrooms where cognitive flexibility theory is applied in this manner are hypothesized to result in students more capable of transferring knowledge across domains.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Advances in ubiquitious {{and mobile}} {{technologies}} have facilitated learners {{to continue their}} learning outside their classrooms, when and where they desire. Learners {{are now able to}} access their learning resources and interact with their peers and teachers through technology. The design and creation of such learning spaces pose many challenges. <b>The</b> <b>learner’s</b> context defines <b>the</b> needs of <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> at any time. To meet the needs of <b>the</b> <b>learner,</b> a set of services must be available anytime and anywhere. To establish <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> context, a model of <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> is essential. This paper focuses on modelling <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> and proposes <b>the</b> use of stereotype modelling to determine the context of <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> and to propose a set of services to <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> to support her learning process. A scenario describes a mobile collaborative <b>learner</b> and <b>the</b> modelling concepts are described using an example. ...|$|R

500|$|In {{the late}} 2000s RNC {{underwent}} significant restructuring as it responded {{to changes in}} the world of employment and therefore the courses that it offered its students. However, some of the college's changes provoked criticism from staff and students who argued these were not in RNC's best interest. There was some controversy over the college's decision to reduce the availability of courses in piano tuning, traditionally regarded as a secure profession for visually impaired people, while fears were expressed that the decrease in A Level subjects would lead to RNC becoming a sport rather than an academic orientated college. Responding to these concerns in July 2008, the then principal Christine Steadman told In Touch, the BBC Radio 4 news programme for visually impaired listeners; [...] "It's about what the local authorities, what the learning and skills council, what the Welsh Assembly for government will purchase from us. And at the moment we are reducing a small number of A Level courses {{but at the same time}} we're extending other courses, for example we've got level 3 Braille being taught for the first time at the college, we're not cutting A Levels, we're just responding to the needs of <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> that are coming through our doors." [...] In an interview in January 2010, the then principal Geoff Draper said that piano tuning would be taught at the college if there was a demand for it, and suggested RNC could look to bringing in international students to fill places.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{adaptive}} {{educational systems}} include several solutions for providing personalized {{access to the}} learning process. <b>The</b> <b>learner's</b> profile constitutes <b>the</b> key element of these solutions. Therefore, an educational system represents <b>the</b> <b>learner's</b> profile by its own syntax, semantic and structure. Each system can have incomplete or partial learner's data. As a consequence, {{there is a strong}} need to exchange <b>the</b> <b>learner's</b> profiles between different systems to enhance and enrich <b>the</b> <b>learner's</b> knowledge. However, <b>the</b> data exchange between <b>the</b> <b>learner's</b> profiles implies interoperability problems. In our work, we are interested in <b>the</b> evolving <b>learner's</b> profiles interoperability problem. In this context, we propose an architecture allowing the data exchange of <b>the</b> <b>learner's</b> profile in educational cross-systems in order to improve the adaptation navigation.

2500|$|In The Journal of the American Medical Association, [...] Zimbardo's {{situational}} perspective received {{support from}} other social situational experiments that demonstrated {{the same idea}} and concept.

Milgram had [...] "teachers" [...] that delivered mock electric shocks to the [...] "learner" [...] for every wrong answer that was given in a multiple choice test. The teachers, however, did not know that the electric shocks were not real, and still delivered them to <b>the</b> <b>learners.</b> At the end of the experiment, 65% of men ages 20–50 complied fully up to the very last voltage. In the same room as the teacher, there was a [...] "confederate" [...] that kept tabs on the teacher and if they were delivering the shocks to each wrong answer. In the beginning of the study, participants signed a waiver that clearly explained the ability to opt out of the experiment and not deliver the shocks. But with the surprising result rate of teachers who did continue to shock <b>the</b> <b>learners,</b> there was a situational force. The situational force that influenced the teachers to continue was the voice of the confederate egging them on by phrases such as, [...] "I advise you to continue with this experiment" [...] or [...] "I am telling you to continue delivering the shocks" [...] and the one that caught most teachers was [...] "You must continue with the shocks." [...] Although the teachers knew that they could leave the experiment at any point in time, they still continued when they felt uncomfortable because of the confederate's voice demanding they proceed.|$|E

[...] Podcasts can also be used as a means of self-reflection on the learning processes or products. Podcasts can help keep students on the same page, including those that are absent! Absent students can use your podcasts to see class lectures, daily activities, homework assignments, handouts, and more. A review of literature that reports the use of audio podcasts in K-12 and higher education found that individuals (1) use existing podcasts and/or (2) create their own podcasts. Students can create their own podcast to share their learning experiences with each other and also with other students from other schools.|$|E
