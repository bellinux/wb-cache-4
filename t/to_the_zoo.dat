5|$|Although Beebe {{continued}} to shoot animals {{when it was}} necessary for the purpose of examining them scientifically, he no longer regarded adding to a collection as a valid reason to take a life. In 1906 Beebe presented his own collection, which had grown to 990 specimens during his earlier years as a collector, as a gift <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> for educational and research purposes. For this gift he was made a life member of the New York Zoological Society. The same year, he was also elected a fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences.|$|E
5|$|In 1972 the zoo gained {{yet more}} {{military}} credentials when king penguin Nils Olav {{was adopted by}} the Norwegian King's Guard. Norway's connection with Edinburgh's penguins began with the Salvesen family's links <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo,</b> and renewed interest was sparked when a lieutenant called Nils Egelien visited the zoo with the King's Guard in 1961. On his return in 1972 Egelien arranged for the unit to adopt one of the penguins. Nils Olav was named after Egelien and in honour of King Olav V of Norway, and given the rank of lance corporal. A statue of the penguin now stands outside the zoo.|$|E
5|$|The Phoenix Zoo {{garnered}} worldwide {{attention for}} one of its animals, an Asian elephant named Ruby. Ruby came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> in 1973, just months after being born in Thailand. After noticing Ruby doodling in the sand with sticks, her keeper decided {{to give her a}} brush and paint. Ruby quickly became known for her paintings, whose sales raised over US$200,000 for the zoo. Art collectors all over the world joined 18-month waiting lists and paid hundreds of dollars for original prints.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, Maude informs Marge that Ned is missing, {{having been}} chased {{around by the}} boys {{throughout}} the night. Marge realizes that she may be partially responsible for his disappearance. Marge goes to Reverend Lovejoy for help, {{and the two of}} them track Ned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo,</b> where Japanese tourists think Homer is Mr. Sparkle. Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney have abandoned their pursuit, but now Ned is trapped in the baboon exhibit. While the Simpson family looks on, Reverend Lovejoy rescues Ned in the baboons' food cart. Now that he feels useful again, Reverend Lovejoy rediscovers his passion for his job, regaling his congregation with the tale of Ned's rescue.|$|E
5|$|The zoo {{provides}} {{lead poisoning}} treatment for California condors from the Grand Canyon area. These birds {{are one of}} the most endangered species on the planet, having at one time been reduced to 22 individuals in the wild. In February 2006, they treated a female (#149) who had been released in the 1990s and her son (#304) who survived a very rare birth in the wild. Both birds were captured in the Grand Canyon region and brought back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> to be treated. A California condor (#133) was still being treated for lead poisoning at the zoo as of March 2010.|$|E
5|$|Three-year-old {{polar bear}} Mercedes was given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> in 1984, {{after she was}} rescued in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. She had begun {{wandering}} into the town in search of food. Because of the danger she posed to residents, Mercedes was tagged with a number so she could be tracked. When {{she could not be}} persuaded to return to the wild, a decision was taken to shoot her. A member of the Edinburgh Zoological Society collaborated with a cousin in Canada {{and they were able to}} rescue Mercedes, finding her a new home at Edinburgh zoo. The bear would become one of the zoo's most popular attractions.|$|E

2500|$|Home <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> polar bears, this $23 million exhibit {{opened on}} March 1, 2006, and {{features}} an underwater viewing building, sea lion observation bubble and a 500-seat amphitheater for daily sea lion shows. This exhibit's theme {{is a tribute}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> First Nations culture in Canada's western province British Columbia, [...] animals that inhabit the Pacific Northwest, and its horticulture. Messages of conservation inspired by Chief Seattle, a famous Native American chief, are sprinkled throughout the exhibit. Six hand-carved totem poles that stand throughout the area received a Native American blessing ceremony {{when they arrived at}} <b>the</b> <b>zoo.</b> <b>The</b> Northwest Passage is also home <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> American bald eagles, black bears, and white-necked ravens.|$|R
50|$|Azy (pronounced AY-zee), is a 38-year-old male orangutan. He {{was born}} at <b>the</b> National <b>Zoo</b> in Washington, D.C. on December 14, 1977. He was {{transferred}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Albuquerque <b>Zoo</b> in 1978, and returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> National <b>Zoo</b> in 1980.|$|R
5|$|Catering for {{visitors}} at Belle Vue {{was on an}} industrial scale, ranging from the late 19th century hot water rooms, which accommodated up to 3,000 diners each, providing crockery and hot water for those who brought their own picnics, to more upmarket themed restaurants. Belle Vue {{became a part of}} the caterer and hotelier Charles Forte's business empire towards the end of its life in the 1960s. Although he made some improvements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo,</b> Forte's interests lay in developing the gardens' dining and exhibition facilities. The Kings Hall was then the largest exhibition space outside London, but competition from the G-Mex exhibition and conference centre in central Manchester led directly to its closure in 1987.|$|E
5|$|In February 1909, Beebe and Blair {{traveled}} to British Guiana, {{in the hope}} that with Roosevelt's support, {{it might be possible to}} establish a permanent field research station there. Another goal of this expedition was to find and capture a hoatzin, a bird whose clawed wings caused it to be considered an important link in the evolution of birds from reptiles. Beebe made extensive documentation of hoatzin behavior through field glasses, but their plans to capture one were foiled when they had to return home early due to Blair breaking her wrist. Despite their failure to obtain their most sought-after prize, the expedition still returned with 280 live birds of 51 species, 33 of which were new <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo,</b> although several of these died or escaped during the long trip back to New York. Beebe summarized this expedition in his book Our Search for a Wilderness, which was enthusiastically well reviewed.|$|E
5|$|Like many mammals, {{elephants}} can {{contract and}} transmit diseases to humans, {{one of which}} is tuberculosis. , tuberculosis appears to be widespread among captive elephants in the US, and because the disease can spread through the air to infect both humans and other animals, it is a public health concern affecting circuses and zoos. In 2012, two elephants in Tete d'Or zoo, Lyon were diagnosed with the disease. Due to the threat of transmitting tuberculosis to other animals or visitors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo,</b> their euthanasia was initially ordered by city authorities but a court later overturned this decision. At an elephant sanctuary in Tennessee, a 54-year-old African elephant was considered to be the source of tuberculosis infections among eight workers.|$|E
50|$|A new layout {{for access}} and parking around <b>the</b> <b>Zoo</b> was finally agreed upon {{after a decade}} of {{negotiation}} between <b>the</b> Council and <b>Zoo.</b> Reorganization of <b>the</b> car parks, closure of various roads, development of forecourts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Zoo’s</b> main entry and extensive new plantings were completed in 1997.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>zoo</b> was {{administered}} by a nonprofit corporation {{with representatives from}} Hebrew University, the Jerusalem Municipality, and the Israeli Ministries of Tourism and Education. From a financial standpoint, however, <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> had little money. Shulov, who retired as director in 1983, often served as director without pay. <b>The</b> <b>zoo</b> was also considered inferior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoos</b> of Tel Aviv and Haifa.|$|R
25|$|Note: Ring-tailed lemurs, red ruffed lemurs, and {{black-and-white}} ruffed lemurs were {{on display}} in the Lied Jungle, but were moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> newest exhibit, Expedition Madagascar, in 2010 because they are from Madagascar.|$|R
5|$|Next to {{the south}} {{entrance}} to the park is the Bärenzwinger (bear pit). This was built in 193839 {{on the site of}} a former sanitation depot, also designed by Ludwig Hoffmann and already decorated with more than 50 plaques by Otto Lessing depicting bears, and a public lavatory, and opened on 17 August 1939. It consists of indoor sleeping quarters and outdoor exercise areas which have held as many as five bears (the armorial animal of Berlin) who are the official bears or mascots of the city. The impetus for building the Bärenzwinger was a letter to the newspaper Berliner Zeitung am Mittag (now B.Z.) from Wilfried Bade which appeared the day {{after the end of the}} celebration of the city's 700-year anniversary, and the Lord Mayor, Julius Lippert, had it completed despite objections from some Nazi functionaries that there were more important things to be done in what proved to be the run-up to World War II. Two of the original bears were gifts from Bern, which also has a bear on its arms. It remains largely unchanged, although it had to be reconstructed after the war; it reopened in 1949 with two new bears, again from Bern; one of these, Jente, produced 33 cubs (including 4 sets of triplets and 9 pairs of twins) before being retired <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo.</b> The last official city bear, Schnute, lived there until her death in 2015; her daughter Maxi also lived there until her death in August 2013. The Bärenzwinger is a listed Berlin landmark. It was threatened with closure in 1990 due to lack of funds for needed modernisation, but after public protest, the Berlin Senate undertook to pay for the project. Underfloor heating in the cages and a skylight dome were added, and the electricity supply was overhauled. The facility reopened in 1993 and celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2009. Some animal protection advocates, including the city's own animal protection officer, have called for it to be closed as oldfashioned and inhumane.|$|E
5|$|The first book, The Quest Begins, {{shows how}} {{each of the}} four bears are either {{abandoned}} or separated from their parents. Kallik is separated from her mother and brother when a pod of orcas (killer whales) eat her mother, while her brother was still {{on the other side of}} the canal, thinking they were both dead. After this, Kallik travels to find her brother. Toklo is abandoned by his mother after his brother, Tobi, dies and his mother sees how the salmon is disappearing, and left Toklo to travel alone. Lusa was born and raised in a zoo. Her story intertwines with Toklo's after his mother is brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> and Lusa hears of the wild. Hoping to leave her home, she escapes the zoo and looks for Toklo. Meanwhile, Toklo finds Ujurak injured and helps him; they begin to travel together. They meet up with Lusa at the end of the book. By Great Bear Lake, the four bears have joined together and they try to go to the Arctic. Although Kallik finds her brother Taqqiq, he has joined a group of bullying bears who kidnap a black bear cub. Taqqiq sees that what he did was wrong and joins the questing bears but he soon leaves the group in the third book when he feels he does not belong with them. The remaining four cubs learn of a place called the Last Great Wilderness in the third book, where there is plentiful food and shelter. After defying hardships such as hunger and bear hunters, they finally make it to the Last Great Wilderness. However, even though they are there, Ujurak, who leads the journey, feels that they need to go further, into the Arctic. In Fire in the Sky, the bears leave the Last Great Wilderness and travel towards the Arctic. In the sixth and final book of the first series, Spirits in the Stars, the four bears make it to Star Island, a place where many polar bears live. They find a sick mother polar bear and her cub. The mother dies from sickness and the four bears look after her cub. Toklo finds that he also struggles with his urge to become a brown bear and travel alone. The bears save the polar bears that inhabit Star Island by destroying an oil rig that was poisoning the seals that they eat, but Ujurak dies in an avalanche while saving the others. Yakone, a young white bear who lived on the strange Star Island with the sick bears, is added to the group of bears on the last page of the book.|$|E
