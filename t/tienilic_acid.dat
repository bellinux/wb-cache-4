Here we show, by using immunoblot techniques, that among the macromolecules present in human adult liver microsomes, one protein called cytochrome P- 450 - 8 is specifically recognized by most sera of patients containing anti-LKM 2 antibodies but not by control serum. Human fetal liver microsomes that do not contain cytochrome P- 450 - 8 are not recognized by the anti-LKM 2 antibodies.

N-dipropyl substitution to yield probenecid or ring-substitution to yield furosemide and piretanide augment the inhibitory potency.

This oxidation is mediated by the proximal positioning of the thiophene over the heme iron, which is proposed to be co-ordinated by an interaction of the TA carboxylic acid to a cationic binding pocket in the enzyme active site. In this study, we inves-tigated how chemical modification of TA influences the bioactivation by CYP 2 C 9.

Of the 10 compounds tested, only two (TA and a noncarboxyl analog) resulted in competitive and time-dependent inhibition of CYP 2 C 9. Metabolic profiling revealed a trend in which substitution of the carboxylate with nonionizable functional groups resulted in metabolic switching from oxidation of the aromatic ring to dealkylation reactions at the opposite side of the structure. The in silico modeling predicted an opposite binding orientation to that of TA for many analogs, including the 3 -thenoyl regio-isomer analog, which contradicts previous models.

The IC 50 for drugs on [14 C]-urate uptake in vesicles loaded with 1 mM cold urate or with 5 mM lactate was, respectively: 0. 7 and 0. 3 microM for benzbromarone; 6 and 4 microM for salicylate; 133 and 13 microM for losartan; 520 and 190 microM for sulfinpyrazone and 807 and 150 microM, for probenecid. The IC 50 ratio for [14 C]-urate uptake in exchange for cold urate or for lactate varied from about 1 for salicylate to 10 for losartan, supporting the hypothesis that two distinct anion exchangers are involved in urate transport. Application of Hill equation revealed that urate/anion exchangers {{have more than one}} binding site, possibly two binding sites with high cooperativity, for benzbromarone and sulfinpyrazone, but only one for probenecid, salicylate and losartan. The uricosuric diuretic, <b>tienilic</b> <b>acid</b> was 10 to 50 times more potent than hydrochlorothiazide, chlorothiazide and furosemide, for inhibiting [14 C]-urate uptake in exchange for cold urate. This higher potency is the reason of its uricosuric properties. All uricosuric agents, as well as the antiuricosuric agents, pyrazinoate and ethambutol, had a much lower potency for inhibiting [14 C]-urate uptake through the voltage sensitive pathway (apical secretory step) than through the urate/anion exchangers. This suggests that antiuricosuria, induced by pyrazinoate and ethambutol, as well as by low concentrations of uricosuric agents, does not result from an inhibition of the apical voltage sensitive pathway...|$|E
40|$|Cytochrome P 450 2 C 9 (CYP 2 C 9) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} CYP enzymes in the human liver. CYP 2 C 9 metabolizes more than 100 therapeutic drugs, including tolbutamide, glyburide, diclofenac, celecoxib, torasemide, phenytoin losartan, and S-warfarin. Some natural and herbal compounds are also metabolized by CYP 2 C 9, probably leading to the formation of toxic metabolites. CYP 2 C 9 also plays a role in the metabolism of several endogenous compounds such as steroids, melatonin, retinoids and arachidonic acid. Many CYP 2 C 9 substrates are weak acids, but CYP 2 C 9 also has the capacity to metabolise neutral, highly lipophilic compounds. A number of ligand-based and homology models of CYP 2 C 9 have been reported and this has provided insights into the binding of ligands to the active site of CYP 2 C 9. Data from the site-directed mutagenesis studies have revealed that a number of residues (e. g. Arg 97, Phe 110, Val 113, Phe 114, Arg 144, Ser 286, Asn 289, Asp 293 and Phe 476) play an important role in ligand binding and determination of substrate specificity. The resolved crystal structures of CYP 2 C 9 have confirmed the importance of these residues in substrate recognition and ligand orientation. CYP 2 C 9 is activated by dapsone and its analogues and R-lansoprazole in a stereo-specific and substrate-dependent manner, probably through binding to the active site and inducing positive cooperativity. CYP 2 C 9 is subject to induction by rifampin, phenobarbital, and dexamethasone, indicating the involvement of pregnane X receptor, constitutive androstane receptor and glucocorticoid receptor in the regulation of CYP 2 C 9. A number of compounds have been found to inhibit CYP 2 C 9 and this may provide an explanation for some clinically important drug interactions. <b>Tienilic</b> <b>acid,</b> suprofen and silybin are mechanism-based inhibitors of CYP 2 C 9. Given the critical role of CYP 2 C 9 in drug metabolism and the presence of polymorphisms, it is important to identify drug candidates as potential substrates, inducer or inhibitors of CYP 2 C 9 in drug development and drug discovery scientists should develop drugs with minimal interactions with this enzyme. Further studies are warranted to explore the molecular determinants for ligand-CYP 2 C 9 binding and the structure-activity relationships...|$|E
40|$|CYP 2 C 9 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} CYP enzymes in the human liver (~ 20 % of hepatic total CYP content). CYP 2 C 9 metabolizes approximately 20 % clinical drugs (> 120 drugs), including a number of drugs with narrow therapeutic ranges. Some natural compounds are also metabolized, probably leading to the formation of toxic metabolites. CYP 2 C 9 also plays a role in the metabolism of several endogenous compounds such as steroids, melatonin, retinoids and arachidonic acid. Typical substrates of CYP 2 C 9 such as celecoxib, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, and diclofenac are relatively small, lipophilic and contain acidic groupings with pKa values in the range 3. 8 - 8. 1 which will be ionized at physiological pH. The carboxylate groups of <b>tienilic</b> <b>acid</b> and diclofenac have been shown to be responsible for substrate preference and orientation in the active site of CYP 2 C 9. Therefore, a typical CYP 2 C 9 substrate should contain an anionic site and a hydrophobic site. However, neutral or positively charged compounds may also be substrates of CYP 2 C 9. CYP 2 C 9 is subject to inhibition by a number of drugs and other compounds and this may provide an explanation for some clinical drug-drug interactions. With regard to prodrugs that need CYP 2 C 9 for activation, inhibition of CYP 2 C 9 may cause a decrease in the amount of the active metabolite, leading to therapeutic failure. Pharmacophore models have revealed that hydrogen bonding, ion-pair interactions, and probably hydrophobic interactions play a major role in determining the substrate specificity and inhibitor selectivity of CYP 2 C 9. A number of structure-activity relationship studies have identified the structural determinants of compounds for their binding affinity to CYP 2 C 9 and inhibitory potency for CYP 2 C 9. Given the critical role of CYP 2 C 9 in drug metabolism and the presence of polymorphisms, it is important to identify drug candidates as potential substrates and/or inhibitors of CYP 2 C 9 in drug development and drugs with minimal interactions with this enzyme should be chosen for further development. Further studies are warranted to explore the molecular determinants for ligand-CYP 2 C 9 binding and the structure-activity relationships. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) are a {{major obstacle}} {{for the development of}} new medicines. They are also a leading cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Although ADRs affect many different organs and bodily systems, drug induced liver injury has lead to the withdrawal of several drugs at the post licensing stage, and is a key cause of drug attrition. Many of the drugs that cause liver injury are thought to do so through metabolism to a reactive metabolite, exposure to which can cause modification of cellular proteins, leading to loss of function, and can result in a loss of cellular homoeostasis. It is therefore important to understand the chemistry and the downstream biochemical events associated with bioactivation. Information on the chemistry of metabolism coupled with mechanistic biomarkers reflective of certain pathways of hepatic injury would enable both researchers and physicians to predict and diagnose DILI, leading to the improvement of safe drug design. This thesis focuses firstly on the use of in vitro models and mass spectrometry to provide integrated data on the metabolism and toxicity of xenobiotics, using thiophene containing molecules as a paradigm. The thiophene ring {{has the potential to be}} bioactivated via S-oxidation and epoxidation pathways, and several thiophene containing drugs have been associated with drug induced liver injury. The investigations described intended firstly to elucidate the chemistry of methapyrilene bioactivation using mass spectrometry and hydrogen-deuterium exchange. The following two chapters aimed to establish a link between bioactivation and toxicity of thiophenes and to evaluate two in vitro models as tool for predicting DILI. The final experimental chapter aims to investigate the potential of ophthalmic acid (OA) to act as a serum biomarker reflective of depletion of hepatic levels of the protective tripeptide, glutathione (GSH). Disturbance of GSH levels through quenching of reactive metabolites can lead to disturbance of its anabolism and catabolism pathways. Indeed, serum OA levels, a GSH analog, have been shown to rise following hepatic GSH depletion. This work utilises GSH adduct formation as a marker of bioactivation of thiophenes in several different in vitro models. Rat liver microsomal incubations were analysed using hydrogen deuterium exchange and LC-MS to define the reactive metabolite of methapyrilene as an S-oxide of the thiophene ring. Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes or single P 450 expressing THLE cell cultures were exposed to either methapyrilene, <b>tienilic</b> <b>acid,</b> ticlopidine or 2 -phenylthiophene and subsequent LC-MS analysis confirmed GSH adduct formation for all compounds in the isolated rat hepatocyte model, but only for 2 -phenylthiophene in the THLE cell model. Cytotoxicity was also investigated in both models, and all compounds were found to cause a greater degree of toxicity in the isolated rat hepatocyte molecule than in the THLE model. By exposing rodents to depletors of hepatic GSH, such as acetaminophen and diethylmaleate, and monitoring the resultant serum OA levels, it has been determined that OA is not a reliable mechanistic marker of hepatic GSH depletion. Kinetic studies of OA in rat serum have revealed that OA is subject to a similar metabolic and elimination pathway as GSH. The overall scope of this work reveals the usefulness of LC-MS/MS to determine S-oxide and epoxide adducts in in vitro studies. The freshly isolated rat hepatocyte model was a useful tool for providing integrated metabolic and toxicological data of thiophene containing molecules and has the potential to be expanded to include data on covalent binding and levels of DILI biomarkers. The single CYP expressing THLE cell model was not as useful in this case, but has been used in other studies to explore the role of discrete P 450 enzymes in toxicity and metabolism. Whilst it is unfortunate that serum OA did not reflect hepatic OA in such a way that it could be easily exploited as a biomarker, this does help us to understand that the plethora of potential biomarkers uncovered by proteomic, metabolomic and transcriptomic studies need to be investigated in depth in order to understand their applications across different species and systems...|$|E
