25|$|Construction was {{organized}} by Einsatzgruppe Wiking, which was based in Mo i Rana and had clerks of works in Fauske and Tømmerneset. The work was performed {{through a number of}} German construction companies. Construction on the Polar Line started from January 1943. The first part of construction was for auxiliary facilities, such as barracks, quays and power supply. The workforce largely provided by Russian and Serbian prisoners of war (POW). Despite the enormous amount of labor-force, construction of the railway was notoriously inefficient and the part of the railway which were completed further south was of such bad quality that most of the permanent way had to be replaced. North of Tysfjorden, the only work was a <b>tote</b> <b>road</b> between Narvik and Bjørnfjell.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{began on}} 24 April 1989. This not only {{included}} {{work on the}} bridge itself, but also National Road 562 from the bridge at Storeklubben to Krokåsskiftet and National Road 563 from the bridge to Kleppestø in Askøy. On the Bergen side, work started at Storavatnet and on the Olsvik Tunnel on 1 June. The breakthrough in the tunnel was reached on 1 December, allowing it {{to function as a}} <b>tote</b> <b>road.</b> World also commenced on the work on National Road 555, including work at Liavatnet and Gravdalsvatnet, in addition to the construction of the Lyderhorn and Damsgård Tunnels. The work on the pylon on the Askøy side was completed in September and on 31 October the viaduct was completed. By the end of 1990, 210 people were working on construction of the bridge itself.|$|E
50|$|Moyie was {{developed}} in 1897 by Glencairn Campbell, who purchased the property and subdivided it into lots. Lot sales were brisk as the Canadian Pacific Railway completed a <b>tote</b> <b>road</b> that allowed twice weekly stagecoach service from Fort Steele, while another <b>tote</b> <b>road</b> from Kootenay Lake was completed that November.|$|E
50|$|Neenah did not {{in general}} suffer {{economically}} due to these changes however, because the water power on the Fox River was still valuable. Soon paper mills replaced the flour mills, for example, and well into the 21st Century the Fox River Valley {{remains one of the}} top paper producing areas in the world. There were other additional benefits to the economy of the state of Wisconsin, one being that the Edward P. Allis Company {{was one of the few}} manufacturers who were capable of producing the rollers and auxiliary equipment for the mills, and that company grew rapidly in the latter half of the 19th Century, diversifying from these early flour mill products into a large portfolio of mining and milling products. The Edward P. Allis Company was the forerunner of Allis-Chalmers. Another major effect on the economy of northern Wisconsin came when a consortium of the newly-wealthy Minneapolis millers formed the Soo line railroad for the purpose of shipping their flour products more directly to the east coast and Europe. In the hey day of the logging industry, the Soo Line provided a cheaper, faster and more direct means for lumberjacks and suppliers to reach the lumber camps. Previously these employees and supplies would have to be taken long distances over rough <b>tote</b> <b>roads</b> by wagon, sleigh or on foot.|$|R

50|$|Baffinland {{claimed a}} drop in ore prices {{required}} {{a return to the}} <b>tote</b> <b>road</b> plan.Between January 2013 and August 2015, the price of ore, per dry metric tonne, dropped from $152 to just over $50 USD.|$|E
50|$|British Columbia Highways Minister Phil Gaglardi {{attended}} {{the scene and}} directed {{the construction of a}} temporary <b>tote</b> <b>road</b> over the southern portion of the slide. In twenty-one days a bumpy route had been established over the slide.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tote</b> <b>road</b> {{approach}} {{seemed to}} have been abandoned when the two groups of investors fighting to assume control of Baffinland agreed to a partnership. However, in late 2014, after the Railway plan had spent several years undergoing it environmental impact assessment, that plan was shelved.|$|E
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1969 the first {{chairlift}} was installed {{to the west of}} <b>Tote</b> <b>Road.</b> The chairlift, Bucksaw (which was taken down in 2015), carried 945 passengers per hour up 1,200 vertical feet and over a mile. It opened up new intermediate terrain referred to now as West Mountain.|$|E
50|$|Gradually, work {{progressed to}} {{reconstruct}} the highway. Elsewhere, the main route of the Trans-Canada Highway was completed in 1957. The Yellowhead Highway became eligible for federal funding soon thereafter. By 1969, the <b>Tote</b> <b>Road</b> was generally rebuilt and paved. On August 15, 1970, British Columbia Premier W. A. C. Bennett officially opened the Yellowhead Highway.|$|E
5000|$|... "Sugarloaf Superquad" [...] is {{the most}} popular lift on the {{mountain}} that services advanced, intermediate, and a few beginner trails. [...] "West Mountain" [...] is serviced by the West Mountain Chair, and the Bucksaw Chair (Sugarloaf's first chairlift). Bullwinkle's Grill, an on-mountain restaurant, is located at the top of these two chairlifts, and right off the <b>Tote</b> <b>Road</b> Trail.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{it would}} take until World War II for any {{improvements}} to be made this overland route. The displacement of many Japanese-Canadians from the Pacific coast to internment camps in the interior led to some developments. [...] of road was constructed along the railway bed, and an additional [...] through steep terrain. By 1944, the <b>Tote</b> <b>Road</b> was opened through Jasper and into the Fraser Valley.|$|E
50|$|In 1942, {{a simple}} sign post {{pointing}} out the distances to various points along the <b>tote</b> <b>road</b> being built was damaged by a bulldozer. Private Carl K. Lindley, serving with the 341st Engineers, was ordered to repair the sign, and decided to personalize the job by adding a sign pointing towards his home town, Danville, Illinois, and giving the distance to it. Several other people added directions to their home towns, and the idea has been snowballing ever since.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Timberline Quad" [...] {{services}} {{the summit of}} Sugarloaf. Formerly located where the current Whiffletree Superquad runs, Timberline services relatively easy runs such as Timberline and <b>Tote</b> <b>Road</b> that start at the top terminal of this lift. The double-black-diamond Snowfields can also be reached from this lift, with trails like White Nitro (New England's steepest lift-serviced trail), Powder Keg and Ignitor, in the [...] "Frontside Snowfields," [...] and unique in the eastern U.S. [...] "Backside Snowfields".|$|E
50|$|The {{road that}} Highway 810 follows was {{originally}} opened as the Massey <b>Tote</b> <b>Road</b> by the Spanish River Lumber Company {{at the turn}} of the 20th century, and provided access for loggers between Lake Huron and logging sites on the River Aux Sables, which the road closely paralleled.In early 1956, this road became Highway 553.The northern 42.6 km of Highway 553 were redesignated as Highway 810 on November 20, 1974. Since then, the highway has remained unchanged.|$|E
50|$|The trail converges {{with the}} Appalachian Trail (AT) just before {{crossing}} the river. Follow the trail about {{a tenth of}} a mile to where it splits, stay left and enter the Hermitage, an old-growth virgin forest of White Pine trees. After a mile of easy walking, the Rim Trail Loop is reached. The Appalachian Trail goes off to the right, another trail goes straight ahead. This is the Tote Road; most people hike back on this trail since the walking is easier than the Rim Trail. Stay left to follow the Gulf Hagas Rim Trail, which immediately crosses scenic Gulf Hagas Brook, eventually reaching the gorge. The Rim trail has numerous overlooks providing views of falls and rapids below. Some include Jaws, Buttermilk Falls, and Billings Falls. The 20 ft high Billings Falls is a highlight of the hike, and at this point you’re nearing the return on the <b>Tote</b> <b>Road.</b> Once the <b>Tote</b> <b>Road</b> is reached take a right and stay on this trail until the AT is reached. This completes the 5 mi loop. Return along the same trail, via the Hermitage.|$|E
50|$|Prospectors, {{promoters}} {{and mining}} men filled the region by 1908, and over 1500 {{men were in}} region looking for silver. The following year three mines were in production; Keeley, Bellellen and Wettlaufer. In 1908 the government of Ontario stepped in to alleviate the difficulties involved with mining development. On the shores of Lake Timiskaming, at a location formerly known as Sullivan's Landing, 8 km east of the camp, the authorities laid out a town site, erected a 200 ft wharf and built a <b>tote</b> <b>road</b> to the camp.|$|E
5000|$|In August 1948, a {{motorcade}} {{was organized}} {{as a demonstration}} of the need for the highway. The Trans-Canada Highway Act was enacted in 1949, providing a 90% subsidy to upgrade selected routes to modern standards. However, the Tote Highway was not included under this subsidy. [...] During the same time frame, the Trans Mountain Oil Pipe Line Company began looking at the <b>Tote</b> <b>Road</b> as a potential route for a pipeline between Edmonton and Vancouver. Construction began in 1952, and largely resulted in the destruction of the road along the pipeline's path.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to hiking and camping, approximately 25% {{of the park}} is open to hunting and trapping (with the exception of moose hunting). Park ponds and streams are open to either fly fishing or general law fishing {{as determined by the}} Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and the Baxter State Park Authority. Snowmobiling is permitted on the <b>Tote</b> <b>Road,</b> the 46 mi dirt road connecting the park's south gate at Togue Pond and the north gate at Matagamon. The park also includes a Scientific Forest Management Area of 29587 acre located in its northwest corner. Park donor Percival Baxter directed that this area be managed for exemplary forest management. The area has been under active management for over 20 years and conducts sustainable, Forest Stewardship Council-certified management.|$|E
50|$|In February 2016 Baffinland {{requested}} {{permission for}} yet another large change in their plans {{as to how to}} get ore onboard their freighters.When permission was given for Baffinland's original plan to build a railway from the mine site to a new port in Steensby Inlet they were given permission to ship 18 million tons of ore, per year. In their second plan, where ore was to be trucked, via a <b>tote</b> <b>road,</b> to Milne Inlet, they had initially only requested permission to ship 4.2 million tons per year. When they requested permission, in 2015, to truck 12 million tons to Milne Inlet Nunavut authorities informed Baffinland that a change of that scale would require an additional extensive environmental review. Six months later Baffinland announced that, while they wanted {{to increase the amount of}} ore shipped through Milne Inlet, they would transport that ore there by rail—not by truck.|$|E
5000|$|There is no road to Hobson Lake. Modern {{access is}} {{difficult}} and a visit is a wilderness experience requiring much preparation and survival skills. A trail, 13 km long, starts {{at the head of}} Clearwater Lake and ends at the outlet of Hobson Lake. It is usually in poor condition with many deadfalls. A major hazard is fording Lickskillet Creek because 40 m high Sundt Falls is just downstream. Rental canoes are available at Hobson Lake by prior arrangement with Clearwater Lake Tours. This company also provides a water taxi to the trailhead. A second access route is an overgrown trail that connects Quesnel Lake and Hobson Lake, the remains of the old mining <b>tote</b> <b>road.</b> There are no trails from the lakeshore to the alpine meadows and reaching treeline is challenging due to dense undergrowth. The Kamloops Mountaineering Club organized two expeditions in the 1990s to climb Mount Hugh Neave and both turned back due to difficult conditions. Access by air is restricted and a special permit from B.C. Parks is required to land a float plane or helicopter at Hobson Lake.|$|E
5000|$|The Ktunaxa had {{for generations}} mined {{argillite}} in the neighbourhood, {{there was nothing}} at Elko but a few survey stakes and a crude <b>tote</b> <b>road</b> before the Foley Brothers’ grading crews worked through here {{towards the end of}} May, 1898, building the roadbed of the B.C. Southern. When the railroad went through in July, the CPR erected what it called a [...] "Crowsnest Pass Branch Standard Second Class Station" [...] and Elko began to grow as Charles E. Ayre’s North Star Lumber Company commenced operations in the woods. North Star soon built a 100,000 board foot-per-day planer mill on the BC Southern near the Elko station to finish the rough lumber coming out of their mill near Jaffray, while nearby the Leask and Johnson saw mill screamed out 60,000 per day. Eventually at least nine timbering outfits were at work along the Railway, on the delta of the Elk and the shores of the Kootenay River. As the last of the easy timber was cut or burned away in the several fires which ravaged the area between 1904 and 1910, the smaller lumber companies began to shut down. Though ranching and orchard industries sprung up on the deforested acres, they did not employ nearly the numbers that logging had and the pace of commerce in Elko slowed. The recession following the Great War diminished coal exports from the mines farther up the Elk and the railroads scaled back their operations.|$|E
