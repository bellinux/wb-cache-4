The land mammals were very few in number: the six species were endemic or related to those of Java or the Moluccas, with none from Australia, so he doubts <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> a land bridge to that continent.|$|E

The lock was closed and removed in 1971, with little protest being made. More recently, the East Anglian Waterways Association promoted {{the idea that the}} Drain could again be made navigable {{as part of a larger}} scheme to improve leisure facilities.

25|$|The invading {{nation is}} never {{specified}} in the books; in fact, no {{nation in the world}} meets the criteria laid out in the series, most likely by deliberate intent of the author. Likewise, no parts of the war outside Ellie's immediate perspective are covered; the reader is not informed exactly how much of the country is under enemy control, or how well the war is going for the Australian military. However the invaders are described in the series as a coalition of highly populous South Asian nations seeing the vast underdeveloped spaces of Australia as a way to tackle their overpopulation (Most likely Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines) and the series features multinational colonies of enemy civilians being set up in conquered territory. Its important for context to note that at time the series was written starting around 1990 and peaking in 1995, 2000 and 2013 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> increasing waves of economic migrants and asylum seekers or 'boat people' attempting to reach Australia from neighbouring pacific countries leading to the controversial creation of foreign detention centres known as the Pacific Solution.|$|E

500|$|After the {{discovery}} of prehistoric rock art on Stonehenge in 1953, Crawford decided to examine the engravings on the megalithic monuments in Brittany.

He further argued that they provided evidence for a religion devoted to a mother goddess which had existed across the Old World from the Palaeolithic through to the period of Christianisation. That same decade also witnessed similar ideas regarding a Neolithic religion focused around a great goddess being espoused in the works of Childe and Daniel; the historian Ronald Hutton later observed that [...] "whether or not <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> an 'Age of the Goddess' in Neolithic Europe, there certainly was one among European intellectuals in the mid twentieth century".

500|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) {{investigated}} the accident. The DC-7 {{was not required}} to be equipped with a flight recorder, which would have automatically recorded the pilots' every control input. Thus, the CAB was forced to rely on witness testimony, radio recordings, and a best guess based on experience. Nevertheless, the CAB determined that the evasive maneuvers taken by the pilot of Flight 663 {{in order to avoid}} the oncoming Pan Am jet caused spatial disorientation. The disorientation, coupled with the extreme maneuver, made it impossible for the pilot to recover from the roll in the few seconds remaining before the DC-7 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. The CAB also determined that Captain Carson had neither the time nor adequate information to assess Flight 663's position relative to Pan Am 212 and, given the illusion of a collision course, he had acted appropriately in initiating evasive maneuvers. The CAB made no recommendations in the final accident report. [...] Although early news reports reported the near miss of Flights 663 and 212, the FAA denied that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> any danger of a collision.|$|E

The Independent wrote, referring to Hamilton's desperate attempts to pass Rosberg: [...] "If <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> a race which confirmed that Formula One {{should be looking at}} ways to facilitate overtaking, this was it." [...] In the wake of his experience, Hamilton called for Formula One to adjust rules to enhance overtaking, saying: [...] "I guess for fans it's probably not too exciting to watch. Of course, it's always nice when you're at the front, as we have been for some time now - but still, being able to race is what... and also down the back, {{the rest of the field}} is probably what fans want to see.

500|$|West's third studio album, Graduation, {{garnered}} major publicity {{when its}} release date pitted West in a sales competition against rapper 50 Cent's Curtis.

Graduation once again continued the string of critical and commercial successes by West, and the album's lead single, [...] "Stronger", garnered the rapper his third number-one hit. [...] "Stronger", which samples French house duo Daft Punk, has been accredited to not only encouraging other hip-hop artists to incorporate house and electronica elements into their music, but also for playing a part in the revival of disco and electro-infused music in the late 2000s. Ben Detrick of XXL cited the outcome of the sales competition between 50 Cent's Curtis and West's Graduation as being responsible for altering the direction of hip-hop and paving the way for new rappers who didn't follow the hardcore-gangster mold, writing, [...] "If <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> a [...] moment to indicate hip-hop's changing direction, it may have come when 50 Cent competed with Kanye in 2007 to see whose album would claim superior sales." ...|$|E

Having the [...] "civilised" [...] Eastern Roman Empire on its southern border was infinitely preferable to the Papacy than having to constantly deal with the troublesome Normans of Sicily. It was in the interest of Pope Adrian IV to reach a deal if at all possible, since doing so would greatly increase his own influence over the entire Orthodox Christian population. Manuel offered a large sum of money to the Pope for the provision of troops, with the request that the Pope grant the Byzantine emperor lordship of three maritime cities in return for assistance in expelling William from Sicily. Manuel also promised to pay 5,000 pounds of gold to the Pope and the Curia. Negotiations were hurriedly carried out, and an alliance was formed between Manuel and Hadrian.|$|E
