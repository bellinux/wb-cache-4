5|$|After Tucker {{is accused}} of murdering James Woods, he reveals that Woods talked him out of auditioning for the lead role in the 1984 hit horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street. The finger is <b>then</b> <b>pointed</b> at Mayor West, who tells the group of his hardships on the social {{networking}} service Twitter, after Woods stole his originally intended username. Diane Simmons also goes on to state that Woods had promised to introduce her to former CBS news anchor Dan Rather, but ultimately ended up introducing her to actor and comedian Danny Bonaduce instead.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{electromagnetic}} radiation closer to the visible region of the spectrum (tens of micrometers to tens of nanometers), power can be transmitted by converting electricity into a laser beam that is <b>then</b> <b>pointed</b> at a photovoltaic cell. This mechanism is generally known as 'power beaming' because the power is beamed at a receiver that can convert it to electrical energy. At the receiver, special photovoltaic laser power converters which are optimized for monochromatic light conversion are applied.|$|E

25|$|Early on 19 April the refuelled and now {{heavily armed}} Georgette {{returned}} and came alongside the whaler, demanding {{the surrender of}} the prisoners and attempting to herd the ship back into Australian waters. They fired a warning shot with the 12-pounder (5kg) cannon that had been installed the night before. Ignoring the demand to surrender, Anthony had raised, and <b>then</b> <b>pointed</b> towards, the U.S. flag, informed the Georgette that {{an attack on the}} Catalpa would be considered an act of war against the USA, and proceeded westward.|$|E
25|$|According to Pelin, {{he walked}} to the upper sector console holding JP550's flight {{progress}} strip. He asked Tasić if the DC-9 could climb to FL350. Tasić took the strip from Pelin and looked at it, then asked where the aircraft was at the moment. Pelin <b>then</b> <b>pointed</b> to a blip on the screen approaching Kostajnica. Tasić's response was 'yes, it could climb'. Pelin then noticed an aircraft on the screen coming from the direction of Metlika and asked Tasić about it, who said 'wait until they cross'. Pelin referred to the middle-sector screen {{to make sure that he}} had identified the DC-9 positively on the upper-sector screen. He then returned to Tasić and they both watched the targets pass each other, at which point Tasić authorised JP550 to climb. Pelin then called out to Erjavec and said 'yes, climb it'. Upon Erjavec receiving the OK from Pelin, he instructed the DC-9 to climb to FL350. That was at 10:07:40.|$|E
25|$|A {{magnetic}} compass points to magnetic north pole, which is approximately 1,000 {{miles from the}} true geographic North Pole. A {{magnetic compass}}'s user can determine true North by finding the magnetic north and then correcting for variation and deviation. Variation {{is defined as the}} angle between the direction of true (geographic) north and the direction of the meridian between the magnetic poles. Variation values for most of the oceans had been calculated and published by 1914. Deviation refers to the response of the compass to local magnetic fields caused by the presence of iron and electric currents; one can partly compensate for these by careful location of the compass and the placement of compensating magnets under the compass itself. Mariners have long known that these measures do not completely cancel deviation; hence, they performed an additional step by measuring the compass bearing of a landmark with a known magnetic bearing. They <b>then</b> <b>pointed</b> their ship to the next compass point and measured again, graphing their results. In this way, correction tables could be created, which would be consulted when compasses were used when traveling in those locations.|$|E

500|$|In {{the middle}} of October, Phát and 19 others were put on trial in a {{military}} court; observers predicted Phát {{would be the only}} one to face the death penalty, and that this would be reduced to a custodial term. Of the accused, 7 were civilians and 13 were military officers. They tried to appear confident and waved to family and friends. Đức told the assembled media the trial was unfair, stating [...] "I believe in the supreme court of conscience". He <b>then</b> <b>pointed</b> to his subordinate officers and called them [...] "national heroes". He denied media speculation he had backed down during the coup to avoid being bombed by Kỳ, claiming [...] "I wanted to avoid bloodshed ... I am very proud of my decision".|$|E
500|$|According to {{director}} Joshua Logan, {{a friend}} of both theatre men, he and Leland Hayward mentioned Michener's best-selling book to Rodgers as a possible basis for the duo's next play, but the composer took no action. [...] Logan recalled that he <b>then</b> <b>pointed</b> it out to Hammerstein, who read Michener's book and spoke to Rodgers; the two agreed to do the project {{so long as they}} had majority control, to which Hayward grudgingly agreed. Michener, in his 1992 memoirs, however, wrote that the stories were first pitched as a movie concept to MGM by Kenneth MacKenna, head of the studio's literary department. [...] MacKenna's half brother was Jo Mielziner, who had designed the sets for Carousel and Allegro. [...] Michener states that Mielziner learned of the work from MacKenna and brought it to the attention of Hammerstein and Rodgers, pledging to create the sets if they took on the project.|$|E
500|$|Bush's {{approval}} ratings were around 80percent during the Gulf War, {{and he was}} described as unbeatable. When Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his , which hurt his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep. By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40percent. Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but {{with the end of}} the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. When Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson addressed Christian themes at the Republican National Convention—with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform—many moderates were alienated. Clinton <b>then</b> <b>pointed</b> to his moderate, [...] "New Democrat" [...] record as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious. Many Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and Bush in previous elections switched their support to Clinton. Clinton and his running mate, Al Gore, toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign, shoring up support and pledging a [...] "new beginning".|$|E

The ceremony began with a performance presenting the theme [...] "the sea: the source of life", which was followed by the national anthems of Azerbaijan and FIDE. Thereafter, the Head of the organising committee and the First Deputy Prime Minister of Azerbaijan Yaqub Eyyubov gave a speech. Eyyubov spoke in Azeri and noted that the Chess Olympiad is the third-largest competition in the world. He mentioned the great contribution of the president Ilham Aliyev and his father Heydar Aliyev to the sport successes of the host country, and <b>then</b> <b>pointed</b> out the great efforts that were done during the preparations for the Chess Olympiad. Finally, Eyyubov confidently stated that everything was ready for a well-organised and enjoyable Olympiad that he promised {{to be one of the}} most memorable in chess history. The next to speak was FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhnov, who welcomed all participants from the record-number of countries and extolled the great preparatory work of the organising committee. He also expressed his belief in the success of the Chess Olympiad on the basis of Azerbaijan's experience in hosting important chess events combined with its remarkable infrastructure and beauty. After their speeches, the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev declared the 42nd Chess Olympiad open.|$|E

While in custody, the detainees were very relaxed. They were sent to prison while the police interrogated a caretaker at the ranch. This person revealed to the police that the ranch had frequent visitors from Serafín's criminal group. The ranch's caretaker identified Kilroy through a photograph and stated that he saw him at the ranch. [...] "Yeah", the caretaker told the police.

Gordon clashed repeatedly with Prince Chun, {{the leader of}} the war party in Beijing who rejected Gordon's advice to seek a compromise solution as Gordon warned that the powerful Russian naval squadron in the Yellow Sea would allow the Russians to land at Tianjin and advance on Beijing. At one point during a meeting with the Council of Ministers, an enraged Gordon picked up a Chinese-English dictionary, looked up the word idiocy, and <b>then</b> <b>pointed</b> at the equivalent Chinese word 白痴 with one hand while pointing at the ministers with the other.|$|E
