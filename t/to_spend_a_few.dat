5|$|Keith Wilson (Don Marshall), {{his wife}} Dorothy (Janee Michelle), their {{daughter}} Lisa (Venetta Rogers), and Keith's boss, Larry Tate (David White), visit {{the home of}} the Stephens family, with whom Lisa is <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days while Keith is away on a business trip for Larry. The Wilsons are African-American {{and all of the other}} characters are white, including the Stephens family: Darrin (Dick Sargent), his wife Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery), their daughter Tabitha (Erin Murphy), and their son Adam (David Lawrence). Tabitha is glad to be able <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days with Lisa and says they will temporarily be sisters. Darrin is another of Larry's employees at advertising agency McMann and Tate. Darrin is trying to land a million-dollar account from Mr. Brockway (Parley Baer), who owns a toy company. Mr. Brockway visits the Stephens residence unannounced to find out if Darrin has any dark secrets. When Mr. Brockway arrives, Samantha is tending to Adam upstairs, so Lisa answers the door. When Lisa says her father works for McMann and Tate and that she is Tabitha's sister, Mr. Brockway leaves, saying he has seen enough.|$|E
5|$|The Manhattan Project was {{replaced}} by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) on 1 January 1947. Fermi served on the AEC General Advisory Committee, an influential scientific committee chaired by Robert Oppenheimer. He also liked <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks of each year at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he collaborated with Nicholas Metropolis, and with John von Neumann on Rayleigh–Taylor instability, the science of what occurs at the border between two fluids of different densities.|$|E
5|$|During {{his final}} years, Narayan, ever fond of conversation, would spend almost every evening with N. Ram, the {{publisher}} of The Hindu, drinking coffee and talking about various topics until well past midnight. Despite his fondness of meeting and talking to people, he stopped giving interviews. The apathy towards interviews {{was the result of}} an interview with Time, after which Narayan had <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days in the hospital, as he was dragged around the city to take photographs that were never used in the article.|$|E

50|$|Radin, {{with the}} aid of sound effects and fake radio messages, convinces the trio that an apocalyptic nuclear war will occur in just moments. He offers them refuge in the shelter if they do one thing: {{apologize}} for their actions. All three refuse his offer and leave the shelter, valuing their honor over their lives and preferring <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> last <b>few</b> moments with their loved ones than to live with Radin.|$|R

25|$|After {{the success}} of Brand New they began touring. In August of that year, they held a Korea-China-Japan summer camp called Shinhwa Summer Story 2004. The camp was {{dedicated}} entirely for their non-Korean fans. Hundreds of non-Korean fans flew to Korea from all over Asia for the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days with the band. They also toured in Japan and held a concert, selling 13,000 tickets within a week.|$|E
25|$|Several {{surveys and}} mariners' charts were made, and the islands were little {{explored}} or studied. An 1854 {{map of the}} islands was used in an English chart, which shows some difference from a Dutch chart made in 1874. In July 1880, Rogier Verbeek, made an official survey of the islands but he was only allowed <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours there. He was able to collect samples from several places, and his investigation proved important in judging the geological impact of the 1883 eruption.|$|E
5000|$|Prince Max {{had planned}} <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days in New Harmony, but his stay [...] "was {{prolonged}} by serious indisposition, nearly resembling cholera, to a four months' winter residence." [...] The Prince devotes {{a chapter of}} his book of the expedition to New Harmony and its environs. He featured the work and personalities of Thomas Say and Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, two leading American naturalists. Lesueur was also a prolific artist.|$|R

25|$|The British Governor of the Punjab and the UP {{arranged}} {{a very high}} position for the Unionist party's top brass, their allies and also for their nominees to assume {{a leading role in}} all the negotiations for constitutional advance in India at the Round Table Conferences in London in 1930s leading to the Government of India Act – 1935. The All India Muslim League had little to say in these negotiations and it was under these circumstances that Mr. Jinnah had <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years in self-exile in London.|$|E
25|$|Head once {{stated that}} he could not recall a time in his life when he had not wished to pursue a career in medicine. He often thought that the dream of {{becoming}} a doctor could have first been formed at the age of eight when his family was involved in an epidemic of scarlet fever. He remembered being taken <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days with the family doctor, Mr. Brett, and one morning at breakfast he startled his family by repeating a procedure that the doctor had used during his illness. Pouring a little tea onto a teaspoon, he had heated it over an oil lamp and carefully inspected the result, checking the tea for albumin as Mr. Brett had done with his urine.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} summer of 1914, Gertrude bought three {{paintings}} by Juan Gris: Roses, Glass and Bottle, and Book and Glasses. Soon after she purchased them from Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler's gallery, the Great War began, Kahnweiler's stock was confiscated {{and he was}} not allowed to return to Paris. Gris, who before the war had entered a binding contract with Kahnweiler for his output, was left without income. Gertrude attempted to enter an ancillary arrangement in which she would forward Gris living expenses in exchange for future pictures. Stein and Toklas had plans to visit England to sign a contract for the publication of Three Lives, <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks there, and then journey to Spain. They left Paris on July 6, 1914 and returned on October 17. When Britain declared war on Germany, Stein and Toklas were visiting Alfred North Whitehead in England. After a supposed three-week trip to England that stretched to three months due to the War, they returned to France, where they spent the first winter of the war.|$|E
60|$|The Crawfords, without {{wanting to}} be cured, were very willing to stay. Mary was {{satisfied}} with the Parsonage as a present home, and Henry equally ready to lengthen his visit. He had come, intending <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days with them; but Mansfield promised well, {{and there was nothing}} to call him elsewhere. It delighted Mrs. Grant to keep them both with her, and Dr. Grant was exceedingly well contented to have it so: a talking pretty young woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant society to an indolent, stay-at-home man; and Mr. Crawford's being his guest was an excuse for drinking claret every day.|$|R
50|$|Professor Filip {{selects a}} four-member {{team for the}} trip, and their {{expedition}} begins. The expedition plans <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours {{in the past to}} save the formula from being burned by a fire in Adam Bernau's home, but something goes wrong, and they are forced <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> several weeks. In the end they realize that the so-called formula was just a juvenile imagination of Adam Bernau and they return to the future, taking with them the old Mr Drchlík, who has helped them much in the past. Mr Drchlík notices the Central Brain standing asymmetric and fixes this with a wooden wedge, and suddenly the Central Brain realizes an error in its calculation. The whole expedition had been moot.|$|R
50|$|Pope {{came upon}} the idea of passport-checking as a {{gameplay}} mechanic after witnessing the behavior of immigration officers through his own international travels. He coupled this with a narrative inspired by spy thriller films, having the immigration officer be one to challenge spies trying to move {{in or out of}} countries with fake travel documents. He was able to build on principles and concepts from some of his earlier games, including his The Republia Times from which he also borrowed the setting of Arstotzka. Pope publicly shared details of the game's development from its onset, leading to high interest in the title and encouraging him to put more effort into the title; though he initially planned <b>to</b> only <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks, Pope ended up spending about nine months on the title.|$|R
500|$|When Edith {{agrees to}} marry Louis, they notify Ethelred, the childless, widowed 8th Duke. He invites them <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days at Chalfont Castle. When Ethelred casually informs Louis {{that he intends}} to remarry in order to produce an heir, Louis {{arranges}} a hunting [...] "accident". Before murdering the Duke, he reveals his motive. Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne dies from the shock of learning that he has become the ninth duke, sparing Louis from murdering his kindly employer. Louis inherits the title, but his triumph proves short-lived. A Scotland Yard detective arrests him on suspicion of having murdered Lionel, who was found dead following Louis's rejection of his drunken plea for help to avoid bankruptcy.|$|E
500|$|During {{his journey}} to Ireland, Lody met a Minneapolis doctor, John William Lee, {{who had been}} {{studying}} eye, ear, nose and throat diseases in Vienna before the outbreak of war had compelled him to leave. Lee was planning to travel back to New York aboard the RMS Baltic, leaving Queenstown (now Cobh) on 7 October, and intended <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days exploring Ireland before his departure. Lody asked where Lee was planning to stay in Dublin; Lee {{told him that it}} would probably be the Gresham Hotel on Sackville Street, to which Lody replied, [...] "All right, let's go there." [...] They travelled together to the hotel, booked into separate rooms, had dinner together and went to the Empire Theatre. Lody told Lee that he had been based in Germany working for an American adding-machine company. When the conversation turned to the war, Lody opined that the German army was a very well-trained body of strong-bodied and enduring men, {{and that it would be}} hard to beat them. The following day they had breakfast together and went for a walk in Phoenix Park.|$|E
500|$|PewDiePie {{originally}} registered a YouTube account {{under the}} name [...] "Pewdie"; he explains that [...] "pew" [...] represents the sound of lasers and [...] "die" [...] means death. After forgetting the password to this account, he then registered the [...] "PewDiePie" [...] YouTube channel on 29 April 2010. After {{he dropped out of}} Chalmers, his parents refused to support him, and as a result he funded his early videos by selling prints of his Photoshop art, as well as working at a hot dog stand. On having to work at the stand, PewDiePie stated, [...] "the fact that I could make videos was so much more important to me than [...] I had <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours a day doing a job that wasn’t that prestigious." [...] Five years later, PewDiePie recalled, [...] "I knew people were big at other types of videos, but there was no one big in gaming, and I didn’t know you could make money out of it. It was never like a career that I could just quit college to pursue. It was just something I loved to do. And here we are five years later and it’s exploded." [...] By December 2011, PewDiePie's channel had around 60,000 subscribers. Around the time his channel earned 700,000 subscribers, PewDiePie spoke at Nonick Conference 2012. On 11 July 2012, the channel reached 1 million subscribers, and it reached 2 million subscribers in September. In October, OpenSlate ranked the PewDiePie channel as the #1 YouTube channel. That December, PewDiePie signed with Maker Studios.|$|E
50|$|After helping Thorstein claim his inheritance, Egil {{returned}} <b>to</b> Iceland and <b>spends</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{years with}} his family. During this time, both Kings Æthelstan and Eirik Bloodaxe died, leaving Eirik's brother Hakon ruler of Norway. Egil returned to Norway to claim lands {{won in a}} duel with Atli the Short {{on behalf of his}} wife Asgerd. Along the way Egil stays with Arinbjorn, whom he convinces to go to King Hákon on his behalf. Hákon denies Egill's claim, so Arinbjörn compensates Egil with forty marks of silver.|$|R
60|$|The voyage {{home was}} a {{pleasant}} but not an exciting one. No suspicious sails were sighted until they neared {{the mouth of the}} Channel. Then two or three craft, which bore the appearance of French privateers, had at different times approached them, but only to draw off as soon as they made out the line of ports of the Spartane. There had been sufficient days of calm and light winds to enable the Duchesnes <b>to</b> frequently <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours on board the frigate. Nat had felt a little uncomfortable at first, but it was not long before he became accustomed to the position. Of course he could not be on the same familiar terms with his officers as he had been on board the Agile, but he insisted upon the first and second lieutenants dining with him regularly.|$|R
50|$|Nusa Ceningan {{has been}} slowly growing in {{popularity}} since 2009. Adventurous travelers cross the yellow bridge {{in search of}} new destinations. Several resorts and hotels have open doors in the recent years. From the look out point to the new zipline over the lagoon, this is becoming a fun island <b>to</b> explore and <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days. <b>A</b> key tourist attraction is the Mahana cliff jump. This {{is located on the}} south easterly side of Nusa Ceningan at Mahana Point Bar. The bar manages two diving platforms at 5 and 13 meters. Jumping is only permitted when the tide is high enough.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are about}} sixteen {{libraries}} and two mobile libraries in Stirling. The Smith Art Gallery and Museum is now free to tourists and residents alike.

2500|$|The {{two young}} men stay over at Maryino for some weeks, then decide to visit a {{relative}} of Arkady's in a neighboring province. There, they observe the local gentry and meet Madame [...] Anna Sergevna Odintsova, an elegant woman of independent means, who cuts a seductively different figure from the pretentious or humdrum types of her surrounding provincial society of gentry. Both are attracted to her, and she, intrigued by Bazarov's singular manner, invites them <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days at her estate, Nikolskoe. While Bazarov at first feels nothing for Anna, Arkady falls head over heels in love with her.|$|E
2500|$|While White's {{life was}} almost always hectic during this period, {{he and his wife}} were able to take a brief respite each summer in Maine. F. Holland Day invited them <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks each year with him at his cabin at Little Good Harbor on Georgetown Island, Maine. They had made this outing an annual event since 1905, and the retreat from the summer heat and his {{business}} worries allowed White to concentrate solely on his work while there. Both [...] "The Pipes of Pan" [...] (1905) and [...] "The Watcher" [...] (1906) were made during his time in Maine.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the initial}} surprise, the German response, having been {{accurately}} planned and organized in detail, was swift and effective; Hitler, who at 17:00 came back <b>to</b> Rastenburg after <b>spending</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days in Ukraine {{at the headquarters}} of Field Marshal Erich von Manstein, soon learned of the armistice from a BBC transmission, and acted with extreme resolve. At 19:50, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes after Badoglio had finished his announcement, the aide of General Jodl broadcast the coded word [...] "Achse" [...] to all subordinated commands; it was the signal for the German forces to attack Italian forces in all the war theaters of the Mediterranean.|$|R
5000|$|More {{than forty}} actors auditioned {{for the role}} of Clark; among them was James Jagger, who began talks with {{producers}} in May 2010. In September, it was announced that Eddie Redmayne had been cast as Clark. Parfitt told the Daily Mail that finding an actor for the role had been difficult. He said [...] "It's a devilishly tricky part to find the right person for because Colin went to Eton, studied at Oxford and flew for the RAF." [...] That same month, it was also announced that Harry Potter actress Emma Watson had been cast in the small role of wardrobe assistant, Lucy. Watson was scheduled <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days on set shooting her scenes to prevent her studies at Brown University from being interrupted. Kenneth Branagh began talks with producers {{for the role of}} Laurence Olivier in July 2010 after Ralph Fiennes had to pull out to direct his adaptation of Coriolanus. Branagh was later cast in the role.|$|R
6000|$|Jack {{is always}} at the house when at home, and is treated by Mr. Godstone and his wife {{as one of the}} family. Indeed, Mrs. Godstone has as much as hinted to Jack's mother {{that she and her husband}} will offer no {{objection}} to the young sailor, but that, of course, they will wish their son-in-law to leave the sea and settle as one of the firm in London. Each time he is at home Jack makes a point of running down <b>to</b> Leigh and <b>spending</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days there. [...] "Sea-life is all very well, uncle," [...] he says, [...] "but for downright good sailing there is nothing in the world that to my mind beats a bawley." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Scottsdale Police Department, {{like most}} its size, had no {{homicide}} division, and was ill-equipped {{to handle a}} high-profile murder investigation. The crime scene yielded few clues; {{there was no evidence}} of forced entry, and nothing of financial value was missing. Detectives examined Crane's extensive videotape collection, which led them to John Henry Carpenter, who had flown to Phoenix on June 25 <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days with Crane. Carpenter's rental car was impounded and searched. [...] Several blood smears were found that matched Crane's blood type; no one else known to have been in the car, including Carpenter, tested for that type. (DNA testing was not yet available.) With no other significant material evidence, the Maricopa County Attorney declined to file charges.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, NASA granted US$15,000 to James Oberg for a {{commission}} to write a point-by-point rebuttal of the hoax claims. However, NASA canceled the commission later that year, after complaints that the book would dignify the accusations. Oberg said that he meant to finish the book. In November 2002, Peter Jennings said [...] "NASA is going <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> thousand dollars trying to prove to some people that the United States did indeed land men on the Moon," [...] and [...] "NASA had been so rattled, [...] hired [...] {{to write a book}} refuting the conspiracy theorists." [...] Oberg says that belief in the hoax theories is not the fault of the conspiracists, but rather that of teachers and people (including NASA) who should provide information to the public.|$|E
2500|$|The {{strike and}} ensuing fire sale left fans in Montreal livid. The Expos {{finished}} {{last in the}} NL East in , and average game attendance fell by nearly 26%, from 24,543 to 18,189. [...] Interest in the Expos continued to decline {{in the years that}} followed; they would never draw more than 20,000 fans per game again during their tenure in Montreal. While noting the Atlanta Braves went on to win 11 consecutive NL East titles following the strike, Jonah Keri expressed the viewpoint of the fans as it related to Brochu and the team's owners: [...] "Expos fans couldn't help but wonder if that could have been them celebrating every year ... had Brochu convinced the team's cheapskate owners <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> damn dollars, or taken a leap of faith that short-term financial pain would lead to long-term success." [...] The media, meanwhile, had taken to calling the Expos a [...] "Triple-A team" [...] as the team seemed to enter a period where they would develop players only to move them on to other organizations.|$|E
5000|$|Ward's stage name, [...] "Lalla", {{comes from}} her {{attempts}} {{as a toddler}} to pronounce her own name. She left school at age 14 because she [...] "loathed every single minute of it", and took her O-levels on her own. Ward studied at the Central School of Speech and Drama from 1968 <b>to</b> 1971. After <b>spending</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years painting, she auditioned at London drama schools [...] "as a sort of dare" [...] to herself: [...] It was a 'see {{if you can do}} it' sort of thing, because it was the thing I hated most—just like somebody who's scared of heights might go rock climbing, or, I don't know, go potholing if they're claustrophobic.|$|R

John and I have {{determined}} to accept the invitation you gave us last summer for Harold <b>to</b> come and <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months with you. His father thinks that a great future will, ere many years, open in the West, {{and that it is}} therefore well the boy should learn something of frontier life. For myself, I would rather that he stayed quietly at home, for he is at present over-fond of adventure; but as my husband is meditating selling his estate here and moving West, it is perhaps better for him.|$|R
60|$|Mr. George Burke was now {{the only}} member of our little party of friends who did not seem entirely {{satisfied}} with his condition and prospects. He made no complaints, but he was restless and discontented. He {{did not want to go}} to sea, for he vowed he had had enough of it, and he did not seem to find any satisfaction in a life on shore. He paid a visit to his mother, but he did not stay with her very long, for Plainton seemed to suit him better.
