5|$|I am vexed and {{surprised}} at your not thinking {{the situation of}} Maria sufficiently important, and can only account for this want of – shall I say it? delicacy of feeling, by recollecting {{that you are a}} man – For my part I cannot suppose any situation more distressing <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> woman of sensibility with an improving mind to be bound, to such a man as I have described, for life – obliged to renounce all the humanizing affections, and to avoid cultivating her taste lest her perception of grace, and refinement of sentiment should sharpen to agony the pangs of disappointment.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the Sydney Theatre Company {{commissioned}} Enright {{to develop}} the play into a feature-length production. The resulting play was titled Blackrock. Blackrock retained the original four characters from A Property of the Clan, and added nine others; it was considered a more fictionalised version of Leigh's murder. The narrative and emphasis were reshaped for an adult audience rather <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> specifically educational environment.|$|E
5|$|Flux-cored, {{self-shielding}} or gasless wire-fed welding {{had been}} developed for simplicity and portability. This avoids the gas system of conventional GMAW and uses a cored wire containing a solid flux. This flux vaporises during welding and produces a plume of shielding gas. Although described as a 'flux', this compound has little activity and acts mostly as an inert shield. The wire is of slightly larger diameter <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> comparable gas-shielded weld, to allow room for the flux. The smallest available is 0.8mm diameter, compared to 0.6mm for solid wire. The shield vapor is slightly active, rather than inert, so the process is always MAGS but not MIG (inert gas shield). This limits the process to steel and not aluminium.|$|E

25|$|When a body {{is not in}} {{a steady}} state, then the notion of {{temperature}} becomes even less safe <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> body in a steady state not in thermodynamic equilibrium. This is also a matter for study in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|For airfoils, the {{reference}} {{area is the}} nominal wing area. Since this tends to be large compared to the frontal area, the resulting drag coefficients tend to be low, much lower <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> car with the same drag, frontal area, and speed.|$|E

25|$|For {{single-phase}} AC, if the transformer is center-tapped, {{then two}} diodes back-to-back (cathode-to-cathode or anode-to-anode, depending upon output polarity required) can form a full-wave rectifier. Twice as many turns are required on the transformer secondary {{to obtain the}} same output voltage <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bridge rectifier, but the power rating is unchanged.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulty}} lies {{in identifying}} public {{companies that are}} sufficiently comparable to the subject company for this purpose. Also, as for a private company, the equity is less liquid (in other words its stocks are less easy to buy or sell) <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> public company, its value {{is considered to be}} slightly lower than such a market-based valuation would give.|$|E

25|$|Denser {{stars with}} higher surface gravity exhibit greater {{pressure}} broadening of spectral lines. The gravity, {{and hence the}} pressure, {{on the surface of}} a giant star is much lower <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> dwarf star because the radius of the giant is much greater than a dwarf of similar mass. Therefore, differences in the spectrum can be interpreted as luminosity effects and a luminosity class can be assigned purely from examination of the spectrum.|$|E
25|$|When the tea {{clippers}} {{arrived in}} China in 1870, {{they found a}} big {{increase in the number}} of steamers, which were in high demand. The rate of freight to London that was given to steamers was nearly twice that paid to the sailing ships. Additionally, the insurance premium for a cargo of tea in a steamer was substantially less <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sailing vessel. So successful were the steamers using the Suez Canal that, in 1871, 45 were built in Clyde shipyards alone for Far Eastern trade.|$|E
25|$|Retrograde orbit: An orbit with an {{inclination}} of {{more than}} 90°. Or rather, an orbit counter to the direction of rotation of the planet. Apart from those in sun-synchronous orbit, few satellites are launched into retrograde orbit because the quantity of fuel required to launch them is much greater <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> prograde orbit. This is because when the rocket starts out on the ground, it already has an eastward component of velocity equal to the rotational velocity of the planet at its launch latitude.|$|E
50|$|Taking {{these factors}} into account, the maximum alpha value for D-T fusion {{neutrons}} in plutonium (density 19.8 g/cm³) is some 8 times higher <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> average fission neutron (2.5 vs 3).|$|R
30|$|The {{pressure}} {{near to the}} magma {{plate is}} higher <b>for</b> <b>a</b> magneto-magma flow <b>than</b> that <b>for</b> <b>a</b> magma flow without a magnetic field.

25|$|Wave-piercing {{catamarans}} {{employ a}} low-buoyancy bow on each hull that is {{pointed at the}} water line and rises aft, up to a level, to allow each hull to pierce waves, rather than ride over them. This allows higher speeds through waves <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> conventional catamaran. They are distinguished from SWATH catamarans, in that the buoyant part of the hull is not tubular. The spanning bridge deck may be configured {{with some of the}} characteristics of a normal V-hull, which allows it to penetrate the crests of waves.|$|E
25|$|The {{calculations}} for a nonspherical primary {{are apparently}} {{orders of magnitude}} harder <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> spherical primary. A spherically symmetric simulation is one-dimensional, while an axially symmetric simulation is two dimensional. Simulations typically divide up each dimension into discrete segments, so a one-dimensional simulation might involve only 100 points, while a similarly accurate two dimensional simulation would require 10,000. This would likely be the reason they would be desirable for a country like the People's Republic of China, which already developed its own nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, especially since {{they were no longer}} conducting nuclear testing which would provide valuable design information.|$|E
25|$|A {{neutron bomb}} is only {{feasible}} if the yield is sufficiently high that efficient fusion stage ignition is possible, {{and if the}} yield is low enough that the case thickness will not absorb too many neutrons. This means that neutron bombs have a yield range of 1–10 kilotons, with fission proportion varying from 50% at 1-kiloton to 25% at 10-kilotons (all of which comes from the primary stage). The neutron output per kiloton is then 10–15 times greater <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pure fission implosion weapon or for a strategic warhead like a W87 or W88.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} crime {{is one of}} the main concerns in slums. Empirical data suggest crime rates are higher in some slums than in non-slums, with slum homicides alone reducing life expectancy of a resident in a Brazil slum by 7 years <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> resident in nearby non-slum. In some countries like Venezuela, officials have sent in the military to control slum criminal violence involved with drugs and weapons. Rape is another serious issue related to crime in slums. In Nairobi slums, for example, one fourth of all teenage girls are raped each year.|$|E
25|$|The common pests afflicting bonsai include insects both {{above and}} beneath the soil, and infections, usually fungal. A tree grown as a bonsai {{is subject to the}} pests that affect the same species full-grown, and also to pests common to other potted plants. Most pests are species-specific, so a {{detailed}} understanding of the specific bonsai species is necessary for identifying and treating most pests. The same materials and techniques used for other affected plants {{can be applied to the}} bonsai, with some relatively minor variation. Pesticide chemicals are usually diluted more for bonsai <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> larger plant, as a regular-strength application may overwhelm the smaller bonsai's biological processes.|$|E
25|$|These {{disorders}} are often best known in some classic form, {{such as the}} homozygous recessive case of a particular mutation that is widespread in some population. In its compound heterozygous forms, the disease may have lower penetrance, because the mutations involved are often less deleterious in combination <b>than</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> homozygous individual with the classic symptoms of the disease. As a result, compound heterozygotes often become ill later in life, with less severe symptoms. Although compound heterozygosity {{as a cause of}} genetic disease had been suspected much earlier, widespread confirmation of the phenomenon was not feasible until the 1980s, when polymerase chain reaction techniques for amplification of DNA made it cost-effective to sequence genes and identify polymorphic alleles.|$|E
