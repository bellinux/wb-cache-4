40|$|The {{simplicity}} and hidden symmetries of (Super) Yang-Mills and (Super) Gravity scattering amplitudes suggest {{the existence of}} a "weak-weak" dual formulation in which these structures are made manifest at the expense of manifest locality. We suggest that this dual description lives in (2, 2) signature and is naturally formulated in twistor space. We recast the BCFW recursion relations in an on-shell form that begs to be transformed into twistor space. Our twistor transformation is inspired by Witten's, but differs in treating twistor and dual twistor variables more equally. In these variables the three and four-point amplitudes are amazingly simple; the BCFW relations are represented by diagrammatic rules that precisely define the "twistor diagrams" of Andrew Hodges. The "Hodges diagrams" for Yang-Mills theory are disks and not trees; they reveal striking connections between amplitudes and suggest a new form for them in momentum space. We also obtain a twistorial formulation of gravity. All tree amplitudes can be combined into an "S-Matrix" functional which is the natural holographic observable in asymptotically flat space; the BCFW formula turns into a quadratic equation for this "S-Matrix", providing a holographic description of N= 4 SYM and N= 8 Supergravity at tree level. We explore loop amplitudes in (2, 2) signature and twistor space, beginning with a discussion of IR behavior. We find that the natural pole prescription renders the amplitudes well-defined and free of IR divergences. Loop amplitudes vanish for generic momenta, and in twistor space are even simpler than their tree-level counterparts! This further supports the idea that there exists a sharply defined object corresponding to the S-Matrix in (2, 2) signature, computed by a dual theory naturally living in twistor space.

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{says that}} the simpler the Lagrangian of a theory the simpler its {{perturbation}} theory, but an increased understanding {{of the structure of}} the S-matrix in gauge theories and gravity has been pointing to the opposite conclusion. In this paper we suggest that N= 8 SUGRA has the simplest interacting S-matrix in 4 D. Using Grassmann coherent states for external particles shows that amplitudes with maximal SUSY are smooth objects, with the action of SUSY manifest. We show that all tree amplitudes in N= 4 SYM and N= 8 SUGRA vanish at (supersymmetric) infinite complex momentum, and can thus be determined by recursion relations. We also identify the action of the non-linearly realized E_{ 7 (7) } symmetry of N= 8 SUGRA on scattering amplitudes. We give a simple discussion of the structure of 1 -loop amplitudes in any QFT, in close parallel to recent work of Forde, showing that the coefficients of scalar "triangle" and "bubble" integrals are determined by the "pole at infinite momentum" of tree amplitude products appearing in cuts. The on-shell superspace for maximal SUSY makes it easy to compute the multiplet sums that arise in these cuts, leading to a simple proof of the absence of triangles and bubbles at 1 -loop. We also argue that rational terms are absent. This establishes the recent conjecture that 1 -loop amplitudes in N= 8 SUGRA have only scalar box integrals, just as N= 4 SYM. It is natural to conjecture that with maximal SUSY, amplitudes are completely determined by their leading singularities even beyond tree- and 1 -loop level; this would directly imply the perturbative finiteness of N= 8 SUGRA. The remarkable properties of scattering amplitudes call for an explanation in terms of a "weak-weak" dual formulation of QFT, a holographic dual of flat space.
