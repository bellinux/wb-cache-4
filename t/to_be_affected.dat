5|$|The Minor Planet Center classifies the trans-Neptunian object 90377 Sedna as a scattered-disc object. Its {{discoverer}} Michael E. Brown {{has suggested}} instead {{that it should}} be considered an inner Oort-cloud object rather than a member of the scattered disc, because, with a perihelion distance of 76 AU, it is too remote <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by the gravitational attraction of the outer planets.|$|E
5|$|A 1994 {{community-based}} {{study indicated}} that two out of every 100,000 people suffered from SCSFLS, while a 2004 emergency room-based study indicated five per 100,000. SCSFLS generally affects the young and middle aged; the average age for onset is 42.3 years, but onset can range from ages 22 to 61. In an 11-year study women {{were found to be}} twice as likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> as men.|$|E

5|$|Although Sedna {{is officially}} {{considered}} a scattered-disc object by the MPC, its discoverer Michael E.

This classification of Sedna as a detached object is accepted in recent publications.|$|E
5|$|During {{this era}} Gaga ventured into business, collaborating with {{consumer}} electronics company Monster Cable Products to create in-ear, jewel-encrusted, headphones called Heartbeats by Lady Gaga. Gaga also partnered with Polaroid in January 2010 as their Creative Director and announced {{a suite of}} photo capturing products called Grey Label. Her collaboration with past producer and ex-boyfriend Rob Fusari led to her production team, Mermaid Music LLC, being sued. At this time, Gaga was tested borderline positive for lupus, but claimed not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by the symptoms and hoped to maintain a healthy lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Factors that {{increase}} the risk of polio infection or affect the severity of the disease include immune deficiency, malnutrition, physical activity immediately following the onset of paralysis, skeletal muscle injury due to injection of vaccines or therapeutic agents, and pregnancy. Although the virus can cross the maternal-fetal barrier during pregnancy, the fetus does not appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by either maternal infection or polio vaccination. Maternal antibodies also cross the placenta, providing passive immunity that protects the infant from polio infection during {{the first few months of}} life.|$|E

5|$|Fort Steuben Bridge's replacement, the Veterans Memorial Bridge, was {{completed}} in 1990. The Ohio Department of Transportation capped funding for maintaining the Fort Steuben Bridge in 1998 at around $200,000 (US$ with inflation) per year. The Fort Steuben Bridge was weight-restricted in 2006 due to the weakening of the structure over time. The assessment prompted a weight limit; reducing the bridge's traffic which consisted of heavy trucks. The bridge was known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by rain vibration.|$|E
5|$|Governor Rick Perry {{activated}} the National Guard and mobilized emergency personnel {{to the region}} expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by the storm. Erin was expected to bring flooding to the region, which had already been declared a disaster area on August 7, 2007 due to widespread flooding on the Nueces River basin; this area remained flooded as of August 15, 2007. On August 15, oil futures rose to $74.01 (USD), due to fears of Erin disrupting oil supplies produced on Texan coasts, combined with low oil inventories. As {{a result of the}} threat from the storm, Shell Oil Company evacuated 188workers on oil platforms in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} {{is caused}} by a number of human activities. Marine mammals that live in coastal environments are most likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by habitat degradation and loss. Developments such as sewage marine outfalls, moorings, dredging, blasting, dumping, port construction, hydroelectric projects, and aquaculture both degrade the environment and take up valuable habitat. For example, extensive shellfish aquaculture takes up valuable space used by coastal marine mammals for important activities such as breeding, foraging and resting.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a third}} theory, {{that the}} 1789 {{epidemic}} was not smallpox but chickenpox - to which indigenous Australians also had no inherited resistance - that happened <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>affecting,</b> or <b>was</b> carried by, members of the First Fleet. This theory has also been disputed.|$|R

5|$|In Europe and the Americas, a {{relatively}} small number of DPB cases have been reported in Asian immigrants and residents, as well as in individuals of non-Asian ancestry. Misdiagnosis has occurred in the West owing to less recognition of the disease than in Asian countries. Relative to the large number of Asians living in the west, the small number of them thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by DPB suggests non-genetic factors may play some role in its cause. This rarity seen in Western Asians may also be partly associated with misdiagnosis.|$|E
5|$|In Western countries, {{the number}} of new episodes per year has been {{estimated}} to be between 0.89 and 1.89 cases per 100,000 people. Children and young adults are less likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> than the elderly: the risk increases by 20% for every decade of life. Men are more likely to develop Guillain–Barré syndrome than women; the relative risk for men is 1.78 compared to women.|$|E

Cathay Pacific claimed that Dragonair will continue to operate as a separate airline within the Cathay Pacific group, maintaining its own Air Operator's Certificate and with the brand unchanged, with 2,976 employees worldwide. However, the airline will be downsized with {{five percent of the}} airline staff retrenched or transferred into Cathay Pacific.

5|$|Other {{less common}} {{conditions}} which {{appear in the}} breed include hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is where elevated levels of Alpha-Hydroxyglutaric acid are in the dog's urine, blood plasma, and spinal fluid. It can cause seizures, muscle stiffness, and ataxia, but is more commonly found in Staffordshire Bull Terriers. A degeneration of the hip joint, known as Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, also occurs in the breed. However, the chances of this condition occurring are much higher in some other breeds, such as the Australian Shepherd and the Miniature Pincher. The breed {{is also one of}} the least likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by a luxating patella, where the knee cap slips out of place.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis is {{generally}} {{thought to be}} a genetic disease that is triggered by environmental factors. In twin studies, identical twins are three times more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> compared to non-identical twins. This suggests that genetic factors predispose to psoriasis. Symptoms often worsen during winter and with certain medications, such as beta blockers or NSAIDs. Infections and psychological stress can also play a role. Psoriasis is not contagious. The underlying mechanism involves the immune system reacting to skin cells. Diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms.|$|E
