5|$|In 1962, Richmond Council {{announced}} {{the replacement of}} the gaslamps on the bridge with electric lighting. The Richmond Society, a local pressure group, protested at the change to the character of the bridge, and succeeded in forcing <b>the</b> <b>council</b> <b>to</b> retain the Victorian gas lamp-posts, converted to electric light, which remain in place today.|$|E

5|$|After Dorgon's {{death on}} the last day of 1650, the Shunzhi Emperor started his {{personal}} rule: he ordered the members of <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>to</b> memorialize to him directly on important matters of state. After Dorgon's supporters had been purged from the court (by March 1651), his former co-regent Jirgalang made a number of special appointments to <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>to</b> foster loyalty among the Manchu elite. Between 1651 and 1653, he added thirty new members who lacked official positions in the Banners or the metropolitan bureaucracy. Two of the new appointees were Chinese Bannermen Fan Wencheng 范文程 (1597–1666) and Ning Wanwo 寗完我 (d. 1665), two of only three Chinese who were ever appointed to the Council. All four of the future regents for the Kangxi Emperor (Oboi, Suksaha, Ebilun, and Soni) were also appointed to the Council at that time. In 1656, the emperor issued an edict abolishing the automatic appointment to the Council of Manchu and Mongol Grand Secretaries, yet by the end of his reign in 1661, the Council still counted more than fifty members. During the Shunzhi reign, the Council was often convened to investigate important officials who had been accused of corruption or malfeasance.|$|E

5|$|Butlin {{proposed}} a new holiday camp at Clacton-on-Sea in Essex in 1936. Both {{the council and}} the local association of hotels were against the idea, as were the boarding house keepers. To persuade them, Butlin took the members of <b>the</b> <b>council</b> <b>to</b> Skegness {{to see how the}} people there appreciated their holiday camp. The councillors were soon won over when they learnt that the local traders in Skegness had seen an initial dip in custom after its construction followed by a rise as campers had visited the town and seasonal workers had come to spend their pay. Once approved by the council, construction began and the camp opened in 1938.|$|E
5|$|In the Telmarine castle, {{the lords}} {{of the council}} learn that Prince Caspian is gone, and Miraz says that Narnians {{abducted}} him. Everyone laughs, saying that Narnians are not real, after which the captured Trumpkin is presented {{in front of them}} as evidence. Miraz persuades <b>the</b> <b>council</b> <b>to</b> attack the Narnians and retrieve Caspian, while secretly plotting to kill him instead. Lord Sopespian suspects Miraz's motives, and discusses his treasonous thoughts with his ally, General Glozelle.|$|E
5|$|On 27 July 2007, the Minister for Local Government {{announced}} a Section 740 inquiry into Port Macquarie-Hastings Council and the Glasshouse project, with particular regard to aspects of financial and project management, the project's impact on <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>to</b> provide services and amenities to the community, and the openness and transparency of {{decisions made by}} the Council. He appointed Frank Willan, a former administrator of Glen Innes Severn Council in 2004, as Commissioner. The mayor expressed disappointment, asserted the methodology of the earlier Section 430 investigation was faulty, and believed the Council's management and decision-making processes would be vindicated.|$|E

Dickinson and the council agreed to consult with the militia commanders and reply to Congress the next day. The following morning, the Pennsylvania Council again refused Congress' request. Lacking sufficient assurances that the state would be willing to protect Congress, the members left Philadelphia that day for Princeton, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Planning {{permission}} {{was granted}} by Camden council in July 2006 after {{changes were made}} to the planning application following a public consultation.

5|$|The {{council was}} short-lived: {{there was just}} one {{legislative}} session. Less than a year after its formation, the smallpox crisis in the District of Keewatin subsided. The Department of the Interior determined that a territorial government for the district was no longer needed. The entire council resigned and was effectively dissolved after being requested to do so on April 16, 1877, by Secretary of State James Aikins. Aikins had the council resign as a cost-saving measure; also he did not want members of <b>the</b> <b>council</b> <b>to</b> abuse the powers of their appointments.|$|E
5|$|The libertines {{continued}} organizing opposition, insulting {{the appointed}} ministers, and challenging {{the authority of}} the Consistory. The council straddled both sides of the conflict, alternately admonishing and upholding Calvin. When Perrin was elected first syndic in February 1552, Calvin's authority appeared to be at its lowest point. After some losses before the council, Calvin believed he was defeated; on 24 July 1553 he asked <b>the</b> <b>council</b> <b>to</b> allow him to resign. Although the libertines controlled the council, his request was refused. The opposition realised that they could curb Calvin's authority, but they did not have enough power to banish him.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>council</b> was <b>to</b> {{be partly}} {{directly}} elected and partly chosen by <b>the</b> town <b>councils</b> of large burghs. Each large burgh was to nominate one (or more depending on population) members of <b>the</b> town <b>council</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> county <b>council.</b> <b>The</b> {{rest of the}} county was divided into electoral divisions (consisting of landward parishes) and small burghs, each returning single members.|$|R
5|$|Throughout, Bethlehem's rule by the British and Jordan, the Syriac Quarter {{was allowed}} to {{participate}} in the election, as were the Ta'amrah Bedouins and Palestinian refugees, hence ratifying the number of municipal members in <b>the</b> <b>council</b> <b>to</b> 11. In 1976, an amendment was passed to allow women to vote and become council members and later the voting age was increased from 21 to 25.|$|E
5|$|Under the Merger Treaty of 1967, the ECSC's Special Council of Ministers and the Council of the EAEC (together {{with their}} other {{independent}} institutions) were merged into the Council of the EEC, which {{would act as}} a single Council of the European Communities. In 1993, the Council adopted the name 'Council of the European Union', following {{the establishment of the}} European Union by the Maastricht Treaty. That treaty strengthened the Council, with the addition of more intergovernmental elements in the three pillars system. However, {{at the same time the}} Parliament and Commission had been strengthened inside the Community pillar, curtailing the ability of <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>to</b> act independently.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the council}} had hesitated in abolishing the mass, the {{decrease}} {{in the exercise of}} traditional piety allowed pastors to be unofficially released from the requirement of celebrating mass. As individual pastors altered their practices as each saw fit, Zwingli was prompted to address this disorganised situation by designing a communion liturgy in the German language. This was published in Aktion oder Brauch des Nachtmahls (Act or Custom of the Supper). Shortly before Easter, Zwingli and his closest associates requested <b>the</b> <b>council</b> <b>to</b> cancel the mass and to introduce the new public order of worship. On Maundy Thursday, 13 April 1525, Zwingli celebrated communion under his new liturgy. Wooden cups and plates were used to avoid any outward displays of formality. The congregation sat at set tables to emphasise the meal aspect of the sacrament. The sermon was {{the focal point of the}} service and there was no organ music or singing. The importance of the sermon in the worship service was underlined by Zwingli's proposal to limit the celebration of communion to four times a year.|$|E

5|$|Benzylpiperazine is, however, to be {{the subject}} of a European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) risk assessment, the results of which may {{determine}} what, if any, control will placed on BZP throughout the European Union. The risk assessment comes about {{as the result of a}} joint Europol – EMCDDA report which concluded that BZP needs to be looked at in more detail. The results were published in June 2007. The report concluded that the use of BZP can lead to medical problems even if the long effects are still unknown. Taking this concession as a basis, the European Commission has decided to ask <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>to</b> place BZP under control of the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. On 4 March 2008, the EU requested countries to place BZP under control within a year and France complied in May 2008.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{being criticized}} for its limited powers, {{there is also}} some concern that the Council's {{responsibilities}} may go too far. By taking up the function of scrutinizing existing and prospective legislation for differentiating measures and inconsistencies with fundamental liberties, the Council may be encroaching on the functions of constitutional interpretation, which is traditionally the function of courts. Even though the Council has the additional advantage of identifying potentially unconstitutional legislation at an early stage, thereby preventing unnecessary litigation in the future, there is doubt as to the ability of <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>to</b> take on such a task. Given that constitutional interpretation is traditionally the function of lawyers and the courts, the task may be best carried out by the legally trained members of the PCMR.|$|E
5|$|By 1852, the {{congestion}} at Somerset House {{had increased}} {{thanks to the}} growing number of Fellows. Therefore, the Library Committee asked <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>to</b> petition Her Majesty's Government to find new facilities, with the advice being to bring all the scientific societies, such as the Linnean and Geological societies, under one roof. In August 1866, the government announced their intention to refurbish Burlington House and move the Royal Academy and other societies there. The Academy moved in 1867, while other societies joined when their facilities were built. The Royal Society moved there in 1873, taking up residence in the East Wing. The top floor was used as accommodation for the Assistant Secretary, while the library was scattered over every room and the old caretaker's apartment was converted into offices. One flaw was that there was not enough space for the office staff, which was then approximately eighty. When, for example, the Society organised the British contribution to the International Geophysical Year in 1954, additional facilities had to be found for the staff outside Burlington House.|$|E
