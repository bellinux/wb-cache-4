5|$|The Girossi newsstands project, {{which was}} never carried out, was a {{commission}} from the <b>tradesman</b> Enrique Girossi de Sanctis. It would have consisted of 20 newsstands, spread throughout Barcelona. Each would have included a public lavatory, a flower stand and glass panels for advertisements {{as well as}} a clock, a calendar, a barometer and a thermometer. Gaudí conceived a structure with iron pillars and marble and glass slabs, crowned by a large iron and glass roof, with a gas illumination system.|$|E
5|$|During 1548, England {{was subject}} to social unrest. After April 1549, a series of armed revolts broke out, fuelled by various {{religious}} and agrarian grievances. The two most serious rebellions, which required major military intervention to put down, were in Devon and Cornwall and in Norfolk. The first, sometimes called the Prayer Book Rebellion, arose from the imposition of Protestantism, and the second, led by a <b>tradesman</b> called Robert Kett, mainly from the encroachment of landlords on common grazing ground. A complex aspect of the social unrest was that the protesters believed they were acting legitimately against enclosing landlords with the Protector's support, convinced that the landlords were the lawbreakers.|$|E

50|$|A large {{quantity}} of data testify the daily business {{relations between the}} people from Ragusa and the Prizren <b>tradesmen.</b> From this data, {{it is obvious that}} the first Kosovar <b>tradesmen</b> were exactly from Prizren, whom we encounter by the end of the 13th century. Except their trade relations in the field of export and import, Prizren <b>tradesmen</b> are in majority of cases found as debtors of the Ragusa creditors. Their number reaches around 100 in the years 1352-1369. It is normal that this figure cannot be a realistic reflection of the total number of <b>tradesmen</b> from Prizren during the mentioned years, considering that there is lack of local saved documents. Whereas, the data deriving from the books of the series of reformations from the Historical archive of Ragusa, show that the <b>tradesmen</b> from Prizren, by the middle of the 14th century are found in Ragusa, not just as debtors, but also as <b>tradesmen</b> of various goods. There are also many cases known of trade with cloth materials and various craftsmanship and artistic products.|$|R

5|$|Women in Mediaeval and Renaissance Europe were legally {{assumed to}} be subject to their fathers, then to their husbands after marriage. The status of women within Mediaeval trades was largely {{dependent}} on the local interpretation of femme sole, the legal term for a single woman. This was usually the widow of a <b>tradesman,</b> who was permitted to continue her husband's business after his death, and often established in the rights and privileges of his trade guild or company. More rarely, single women would achieve success in their father's trade. Exceptions occurred mainly in trades linked to traditional women's occupations, such as haberdashery and needlecraft.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{their best}} efforts to control Viet Cong {{activities}} across the river in the Thu Thiem area, the South Vietnamese military and police could not stop Viet Cong agents from operating there. So Viet Cong members of the 65th Special Operations Group were able to watch U.S. and South Vietnamese military activities at the port, while they were preparing to attack American targets. Lam Son Nao, a commando of the 65th Special Operations Group, was also an employee at the port facility. As his unit was assigned with the mission to attack the American escort carrier, Nao took advantage of his position as an employee at the port facility, to reconnoitre Card to design the best strategy to sabotage the ship and all the military hardware on board. Nao’s father had previously worked at the port facility as a <b>tradesman,</b> so he memorised all the underground tunnels and sewerage systems which ran {{in and out of}} the facility. He advised Nao that the best way to enter the area where the American ships normally anchored, was via the sewer tunnel opposite Thu Thiem.|$|E

5|$|The Judd School was {{established}} in 1888, but {{the need for a}} secondary school to supplement Sir Andrew Judd's Grammar School (now known as the famous Public School: Tonbridge School) was acknowledged as early as 1870, after it was revealed that only one in 200 of its students {{was the son of a}} Tonbridge <b>tradesman.</b> Tonbridge School was founded in 1553 by Sir Andrew Judd, who made a fortune in the Muscovy fur trade during the 16th century. His endowment was left in the hands of the Skinners Company, who agreed to fund the establishment of a commercial school in Tonbridge in 1875. However, the Charity Commissioners – empowered by the 1869 Endowed Schools Act to govern the establishment of charitably funded schools – directed that the £20,000 provided by The Skinners' Company for this cause be taken to neighbouring Tunbridge Wells, where it was used to establish The Skinners' School in September 1887.|$|E
