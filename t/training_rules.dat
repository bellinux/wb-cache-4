Bell said, “In my opinion, Dave {{was one of the}} greatest football players in professional football when he wanted to be.

2500|$|In 1949, {{the club}} {{became the first}} to appoint Bill Shankly as manager. Shankly, a former player at Carlisle, later went on to manage local rivals Workington (helping them finish above Carlisle for the first time) before being {{appointed}} as manager of Liverpool in 1959; over the next 15 years he would guide that club to numerous trophy successes. It is at Carlisle where he met local player Geoff Twentyman, who he would later sign as head scout at Liverpool, and lifelong friend Ivor Broadis. Broadis, who was playing for Sunderland but living and training with Carlisle, once arrived late for training and Shankly asserted that he would play by United's <b>training</b> <b>rules</b> even if he didn't play there. According to Shankly, he said to Broadis: [...] "What {{do you think you}}'re doing? Who do you think you are? If you do the training we do you can train with us and we'll play five-a-side and you'll run your guts out as an example to everybody else".|$|E

5000|$|There {{is also a}} more strict set of precepts {{called the}} eight precepts which are taken at {{specific}} religious days or religious retreats. The eight precepts encourage further discipline and are modeled on the monastic code. In the eight precepts, the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict and becomes a precept of celibacy. The three additional rules of the Eight Precepts are:“I accept the <b>training</b> <b>rule</b> to abstain from food at improper times.” (e.g. no solid foods after noon, and not until dawn the following day)“I accept the <b>training</b> <b>rule</b> (a) to abstain from dancing, singing, instrumental music, and shows, and (b) {{from the use of}} jewelry, cosmetics, and beauty lotions.”“I accept the <b>training</b> <b>rule</b> to abstain from the use of high and luxurious beds and seats.” ...|$|R

The kneeling and bowing is done first three times with feet, hands, elbows, knees and head touching the floor. This is followed by reciting loudly the memorised prayers, with folded hands (palms at the heart). The prayers offered from sunrise until the next dawn starting with the words are: [...] As long as this life lasts.I hereby take refuge in the Buddha.

50|$|Lay {{followers}} undertake these <b>training</b> <b>rules</b> at {{the same}} time as they become Buddhists. In Mahayana schools a lay practitioner who has taken the precepts is called an upāsaka or upāsikā (layman or laywoman).

50|$|Similarly, one of {{the five}} precepts of Buddhism is abstaining from intoxicating {{substances}} that disturb the peace and self-control of the mind, but it is formulated as a <b>training</b> <b>rule</b> to be assumed voluntarily rather than as a commandment.|$|R
50|$|In Theravada Buddhism, nuns (Pāli: bhikkhunis) and monks (Pāli: bhikkhus) go {{on a daily}} almsround (pindacara) {{to collect}} food (piṇḍapāta).

Money cannot be accepted by a Theravadan Buddhist monk or nun in lieu of or in addition to food, as the Patimokkha <b>training</b> <b>rules</b> make it an offence worth forfeiture and confession.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, Mosbacher co-directed and co-produced with Fawn Yacker the {{documentary}} film <b>Training</b> <b>Rules,</b> an hour-long movie about Rene Portland, a women's basketball coach from Penn State University.

40|$|Abstract. The Scanning N-Tuple {{classifier}} (SNT) {{was introduced}} by Lucas and Amiri [1, 2] as an efficient and accurate classifier for chaincoded hand-written digits. The SNT operates as speeds {{of tens of thousands}} of sequences per second, during both the training and the recognition phases. The main contribution of this paper is to present a new discriminative <b>training</b> <b>rule</b> for the SNT. Two versions of the rule are provided, based on minimizing the mean-squared error and the cross-entropy, respectively. The discriminative <b>training</b> <b>rule</b> offers improved accuracy at the cost of slower training time, since the training is now iterative instead of single pass. The cross-entropy trained SNT offers the best results, with an error rate of 2. 5 % on sequences derived from the MNIST test set. ...|$|R
