Gillian Anderson later noted, [...] "Because of all the magic, I was {{constantly}} being entertained. The difficulty with something like <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> have tendency to forget that people are still having bad things happen to them." [...] Anderson later stated that, {{because many of the}} lines were written in a tongue-in-cheek style, she and David Duchovny said them in a humorous style; the two had to keep reminding themselves that the story revolved around a murder.|$|E

6000|$|The clink of irons was {{immediately}} afterwards heard upon the stair, {{and in two}} or three minutes a man was introduced, handcuffed and fettered. He was thick, brawny, and muscular, and although his shagged and grizzled hair marked an age somewhat advanced, and his stature was rather low, he appeared, nevertheless, a person whom few would have chosen to cope with in personal conflict. His coarse and savage features were still flushed, and his eye still reeled {{under the influence of the}} strong potation which had proved the immediate cause of his seizure. But the sleep, though short, which Mac-Guffog had allowed him, and still more a sense of the peril of his situation, had restored to him the full use of his faculties. The worthy judge and the no less estimable captive looked at each other steadily for a long time without speaking. Glossin apparently recognised his prisoner, but seemed at a loss how to proceed with his investigation. At length he broke silence.--'Soh, Captain, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>you?</b> you have been a stranger on this coast for some years.' ...|$|E

They placed a pillow from the sofa under the boy's head, gave him a little {{lemonade}} to drink, and then one of the doctors left, after having aided in placing Captain Hampton on the bed, propped up almost into a sitting position by pillows. Jacob dozed off into a confused sleep. Occasionally he woke up and saw the doctor sitting by his master's bedside, and then relapsed into sleep. At last he started up at the sound of a voice. The sun was gleaming through the window and the doctor was standing speaking to Captain Hampton.|$|E
