Pierced adornments of the lip, or labrets, were sported by the Tlingit {{as well as}} peoples of Papua New Guinea and the Amazon basin.

The practice of stretching the lips by piercing them and inserting plates or plugs was found throughout Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and South America as well as {{among some of the}} tribes of the Pacific Northwest and Africa. In some parts of Malawi, it was quite common for women to adorn their lips with a lip disc called a [...] "pelele" [...] that by means of gradual enlargement from childhood could reach several inches of diameter and would eventually alter <b>the</b> <b>occlusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jaw.

2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the regulation}} of c-Raf activity is complex. As a [...] "gatekeeper" [...] of the ERK1/2 pathway, it is kept in check by a multitude of inhibitory mechanisms, and normally cannot be activated in a single step. The most important regulatory mechanism involves the direct, physical association of the N-terminal autoinhibitory block to the kinase domain of c-Raf. It results in <b>the</b> <b>occlusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> catalytic site and full shutdown of kinase activity. This [...] "closed" [...] state can only be relieved if the autoinhibitory domain of Raf engages a partner competing with its own kinase domain, most importantly GTP-bound Ras. Activated small G-proteins can thus break up the intramolacular interactions: {{this results in a}} conformational change ("opening") of c-Raf necessary for kinase activation and substrate binding.|$|E

30|$|In {{experimental}} studies, <b>the</b> <b>occlusion</b> <b>of</b> large pulmonary arteries led to underestimation of EVLWI by transpulmonary thermo-dye dilution {{compared with}} gravimetry, which was corrected after <b>the</b> reopening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arteries [51 – 53]. However, underestimation of EVLWI was observed only when large vessels were occluded [51, 53], not small vessels [52]. The clinical {{implication is that}} <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> EVLWI measured by thermodilution is likely underestimated in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> pulmonary embolism. During ARDS, <b>the</b> <b>occlusions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pulmonary vasculature that could result from vascular remodelling, microthrombi, hypoxic vasoconstriction or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) [54] mainly affect the small vessels.

30|$|Before {{moving into}} the next frame, the {{tracking}} algorithm may also adaptively update <b>the</b> template when <b>occlusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target is detected. This is accomplished by using a sparse coefficient histogram matrix (SCHM) [16] to estimate <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target. If so, the algorithm uses the newly estimated template, or a weighted linear combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estimated template and an initial template depending on <b>the</b> percentage <b>of</b> patches that are deemed occluded.

50|$|During <b>the</b> <b>occlusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stop, {{pulling the}} glottis {{downward}} rarefies {{the air in}} the vocal tract. The stop is then released.

5000|$|Proliferation {{of smooth}} muscle {{cells in the}} walls of the Moyamoya {{affected}} arteries {{has been found to be}} representative of the disease. A study of six autopsies of six patients who died from Moyamoya disease lead to the finding that there is evidence that supports the theory that there is a thickening, or proliferation, of the innermost layer of the vessels affected by Moyamoya. These vessels are the ACA (anterior cerebral artery), MCA (middle cerebral artery), and ICA (internal carotid artery). <b>The</b> <b>occlusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ICA results in concomitant diminution of the [...] "puff-of-smoke" [...] collateral's, as they are supplied by the ICA.|$|E
50|$|The ghost ring sight is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} the fastest type of aperture sight. It is fairly accurate, easy to use, and obscures the target less than nearly all other non-optical sights. Because of this, ghost ring sights are commonly installed on combat shotguns and submachine guns (and to a much lesser extent, rifles). The ghost ring is a fairly recent innovation, and differs from traditional aperture sights in the extreme thinness of the rear ring, and the slightly thicker front sight. The thin ring minimizes <b>the</b> <b>occlusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target, while the thicker front post makes it easy to find quickly.|$|E

Limiting the ROI can avoid affecting the main camera image with the incomplete reconstruction results, including unnecessary artifacts or can reduce the processing cost.

50|$|In {{the case}} of SERCA1a, energy from ATP is used to {{transport}} 2 Ca2+-ions from the cytoplasmic side to the lumen of the sarcoplasmatic reticulum, and to countertransport 1-3 protons into the cytoplasm. Starting in the E1/E2 state, the reaction cycle begins as the enzyme releases 1-3 protons from the cation-ligating residues, in exchange for cytoplasmic Ca2+-ions. This leads to assembly of the phosphorylation site between the ATP-bound N domain and the P domain, while the A domain directs <b>the</b> <b>occlusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bound Ca2+. In this occluded state, the Ca2+ ions are buried in a proteinaceous environment with no access {{to either side of}} the membrane.The Ca2E1~P state becomes formed through a kinase reaction, where the P domain becomes phosphorylated, producing ADP. The cleavage of the β-phosphodiester bond releases the gamma-phosphate from ADP and unleashes the N domain from the P domain.|$|E
50|$|Many {{tracking}} systems {{are based on}} a model focused on a problem of sequence estimation, where a sequence of images is given and a model of changing, we estimate the 3D configuration for each photo.All the possible hand configurations are represented by vectors on a state space, which codes theposition of the hand and the angles of the finger’s joint. Each hand configuration generates a set ofimages through the detection of the borders of <b>the</b> <b>occlusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finger’s joint. The estimation of eachimage is calculated by finding the state vector that better fits to the measured characteristics.The finger joints have the added 21 states more than the rigid body movement of the palms; this meansthat the cost computational of the estimation is increased. The technique consists of label each finger joint links is modeled as a cylinder. We do the axes at each joint and bisector of this axis is the projection of the joint. Hence we use 3 DOF, because there are only 3 degrees of movement.|$|E

40|$|Particle {{dispersion}} in {{a two-dimensional}} peristaltic flow with zero pressure rise is investigated. It is found that, depending on <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peristalsis, particle motion can be forward or retrograde.

50|$|The {{effects of}} {{dizocilpine}} at NMDA receptors {{are clear and}} significant. NMDA receptors are key in the progression of excitotoxicity (a process in which an excessive amount of extracellular glutamate overexcites glutamate receptors and harms neurons). Thus NMDA receptor antagonists including dizocilpine have been extensively studied for use in treatment of diseases with excitotoxic components, such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Dizocilpine has shown effectiveness in protecting neurons in cell culture and animal models of excitotoxic neurodegeneration. The administration of dizocilpine protected the hippocampus from ischemia-induced neurodegeneration in the gerbil. The ED50 (effective dose 50) for neuroprotection was 0.3 mg/kg {{and the majority of}} the animals were protected against the ischemia-induced damage at doses {{greater than or equal to}} 3 mg/kg, when dizocilpine was given one hour prior to <b>the</b> <b>occlusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carotid arteries, although other studies have shown protection up to 24 hours post-insult. Excitatory amino acids, such as glutamate and aspartate, are released in toxic amounts when the brain is deprived of blood and oxygen and NMDA receptors are thought to prevent the neurodegeneration through the inhibition of these receptors.|$|E
