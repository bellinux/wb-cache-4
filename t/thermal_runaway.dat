40|$|The {{effects of}} thermal {{imbalance}} (dS 1 /dt ≠ 0) on stellar pulsational stability {{have largely been}} ignored in the literature. Here we have used the linear, quasi-adiabatic pulsation theory to make a preliminary investigation of such effects.

The latter become more important when substantial ionization zones exist in the stellar matter. It is argued that the influence of thermal imbalance on pulsational stability should be quite small for stars crossing the H-R diagram in early post-main-sequence evolution, and for cooling degenerate stars.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an account of}} a self-sustaining decomposition event of the NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium) fertilizer freight aboard the ship Ostedijk. The fire developed inside the cargo hold for several days until it was controlled. Analysis of plume images shows a rapidly growing fire and {{provides an}} estimate of the evolution of the mass loss rate, ranging from approximately 0. 5 kg·s- 1 the first day to 12 kg·s- 1 on the last day.

The measured heat of reaction is 6. 1 MJ/kg, about one third of the value for flaming wood. Measurements are applied to the Ostedijk events and allow estimation of the maximum fire size to be in the order of 70 MW.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{concerns}} a hazardous event which occurred {{in an industrial}} storage tank of a ground insecticide. A preliminary post-accident approach of the hazard evaluation is performed. The rapid report {{of the presence of}} an unstable functional group in the active product and of its potential thermal instability (CHETAH indices) has led to complete this examination by an experimental study of thermal analysis using isotherm exposition measurement (DTA) or with temperature programming by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and oxidability tests (BAM). The apparent kinetics of decomposition of the active matter of the ground insecticide has been represented by a global Arrhenius law. A model designed for the simulation of heterogeneous <b>thermal</b> <b>runaways</b> based on the numerical solution of the transient mass and energy balances has been further applied to define the critical conditions of the storage and simulate its behavior.

In a press briefing that day, NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said that the NTSB had found evidence of failure of multiple safety systems designed to prevent these battery problems, and stated that fire must never happen on an aircraft. The Japan Transport Safety Board (JTSB) has said on January 23 that the battery in ANA jets in Japan reached a maximum voltage of 31 V (lower than the 32 V limit like the Boston JAL 787), but had a sudden unexplained voltage drop to near zero.

40|$|In {{chemical}} processes, runaway reactions, i. e. exothermic reactions {{getting out}} of control, represent a potential hazard source. These processes may occur not only during chemical processing but also during storage and transportation. Quite often runaway reactions {{play an important role}} in the chain of a developing incident therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate their characteristic features in order to develop early detection and process control systems for anticipating uncontrolled runaway excursions in process plants. Such <b>thermal</b> <b>runaways</b> may be caused by an exothermic decomposition or by runaway of a desired exothermic reaction. In the case of runaway chemical reactions a thermal explosion is preceded by a self-heating process In a polymerization system the self-heating process is strongly influenced by self-acceleration behaviour due to the gel effect. The prime cause of these events is overheating which can lead to hazardous situations. The very high exothermicity of the process connected with a strong acceleration in rate versus conversioni makes the temperature control of the reactor very critical. A research programme on runaway reactions must lead to the identification of chemical, physical chemical and technological characteristics of the system under consideration in order to estimate the system safety and determine the criteria concerning the design and the control of the reactors and their protection systems. Modelling of the process and experimental tests are two efficient tools to investigate an area in which knowledge is still lacking.

25|$|In {{addition}} to normal breakdown {{ratings of the}} device, power BJTs are subject to a failure mode called secondary breakdown, in which excessive current and normal imperfections in the silicon die cause portions of the silicon inside the device to become disproportionately hotter than the others. The electrical resistivity of doped silicon, like other semiconductors, has a negative temperature coefficient, meaning that it conducts more current at higher temperatures. Thus, the hottest {{part of the die}} conducts the most current, causing its conductivity to increase, which then causes it to become progressively hotter again, until the device fails internally. The <b>thermal</b> <b>runaway</b> process associated with secondary breakdown, once triggered, occurs almost instantly and may catastrophically damage the transistor package.|$|E

40|$|A {{model for}} the growth of a catalyst-polymer {{particle}} during gas-phase polymerization of (alpha) -olefins is developed. In order to design the polymerization reactor, the behavior of a pellet is analyzed through the model. ^ Low-pressure, gas-phase polymerization processes use various heterogeneous catalysts, supported and unsupported. Initial catalyst particles break into small fragments, kept in contact through polymer entanglements. This phenomenon creates a pellet formed by the aggregation of thousands of microparticles, each with a catalyst micronucleus surrounded by a growing polymer layer. Monomer diffuses from the gas phase to the active sites {{on the surface of the}} micronucleus. This process include transport within the pellet along the voids among microparticles, and through their growing polymer layer. Heat of polymerization must be transferred from the active sites to the bulk phase. ^ Approximate analytical solutions are developed to model the heat and mass transfer in the microparticle. A multigrain model combines these solutions to predict transport in the pellet. The analytical solutions make the separate treatment of the microparticle and pellet scales tractable. Consequently, fragmentation steps are included in the model. Polymerization and pellet growth rates are predicted. ^ Results show energy transfer effects are critical during initial steps of the pellet growth. <b>Thermal</b> <b>runaways</b> leading to polymer melting are possible if heat transfer to the bulk phase is inadequate. Catalyst fragmentation and overheating phenomena occur at the same time scale, and their interaction is important. Diffusion effects in the pellet are critical at the initial growth steps and during thermal excursions. Time scales for these processes are much shorter than the pellet total reaction times. Thus, transport through the pellet has little effect on the molecular weight distribution of the polymer. ^ The pellet model is applied to the base-case design of a fluidized-bed reactor. The fluid velocity and reactor dimensions are predicted. The model is used to analyze the effects of the reactor environment on the polymerization process. ...|$|R
