40|$|We {{consider}} bright solitons {{supported by}} a symmetric inhomogeneous defocusing nonlinearity growing rapidly enough toward {{the periphery of the}} medium, combined with an antisymmetric gain-loss profile. Despite the absence of any symmetric modulation of the linear refractive index, which is usually required to establish a parity-time (PT) symmetry {{in the form of a}} purely real spectrum of modes, we show that the PT symmetry is never broken in the present system, and that the system always supports stable bright solitons, i. e., fundamental and multipole ones. <b>This</b> <b>fact</b> is <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> the nonlinearizability of the underlying evolution equation. The increase of the gain - loss strength results, in lieu of the PT symmetry breaking, in merger of pairs of different soliton branches, such as fundamental and dipole, or tripole and quadrupole ones.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} there are three types of shape of {{acoustic}} body waves propagating inside competent and homogeneous formations penetrated by a borehole : simple, double, and resonant. <b>This</b> <b>fact</b> is <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> the modifications undergone by the area located around a well after drilling in relation to in situ state of stress. There are overstressed and understressed vertical cylindrical zones with "bubble-shaped" cross-sections, in which acoustic body waves are supposed to reflect. The horizontal size and the shape of the stress modified areas depend on the values of (K 1 +K 2) / 2 - with K 1 =SH/Sv (the overburden pressure) and K 2 =Sh/Sv -, that is to say on the in situ horizontal stress and the anisotropy of this stress. The calculation of the velocities of the P and S double waves allows us to evaluate the radial thicknesses of these stress modified areas. As their values are different according to whether they result from P or S waves, we propose an explanation based on their wavelengths. The comparisons with other works on the in situ stress of the studied boreholes allow us to propose a method for evaluating the horizontal stress and its anisotropy, thanks to the estimation of the value (K 1 +K 2) / 2...|$|R

40|$|Assuming {{a general}} timelike {{congruence}} of worldlines {{as a reference}} frame, we derive a covariant general formalism of inertial forces in general relativity. Inspired by the works of Abramowicz et al (see e. g. Abramowicz and Lasota 1997 Class. Quantum Grav. 14 A 23 - 30), we also study conformal rescalings of spacetime and investigate how these affect the inertial force formalism. While many ways of describing spatial curvature of a trajectory have been discussed in papers prior to this, one particular prescription (which differs from the standard projected curvature when the reference congruence is shearing), appears novel. For the particular case of a hypersurface-forming congruence, using a suitable rescaling of spacetime, we show that a geodesic photon always follows a line that is spatially straight {{with respect to the}} new curvature measure. <b>This</b> <b>fact</b> is intimately <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> Fermat's principle, and allows for a certain generalization of the optical geometry as will be further pursued in a companion paper (Jonsson and Westman 2006 Class. Quantum Grav. 23 61). For the particular case when the shear tensor vanishes, we present the inertial force equation in a three-dimensional form (using the bold-face vector notation), and note how similar it is to its Newtonian counterpart. From the spatial curvature measures that we introduce, we derive corresponding covariant differentiations of a vector defined along a spacetime trajectory.

40|$|The site of Gardolo di Mezzo (350 m a. s. l.) is {{situated}} in the central eastern area of the southern region of the Alps, along the left-hand side of the Adige Valley. Preventive archaeological surveys, {{carried out by the}} Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici of the Provincia autonoma of Trento, brought to light an extensive archaeological area. The site has provided traces of a settlement and two tumuli have been found nearby, with a complex stratigraphic sequence in which colluvial layers alternate with anthropic structures. The more ancient levels of one of these platforms have brought to light a subcircular burial mound with a subrectangular enclosure covered by pebbles. The anthropological studies carried out on skeletal remains found inside the structure showed the presence of a buried individual of about 5 years ± 16 months of age. Inside the enclosure there were also 15 pieces of slag and a ceramic jug which can be dated to the Early Bronze Age. The area was occupied from the Early to the Late Bronze Age but the chronology of the founding of the structures may be further anticipated as more research is carried out. The presence of many fragments of coarse slag and several grinding stones across the entire area suggests intense activities in copper smelting during the various phases of occupation. <b>This</b> <b>fact</b> is probably <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> the exploitation, during the Bronze Age, of the ore sources of the Monte Calisio nearby, a well-known mining area in the Middle Ages.

40|$|Abstract. We {{combine the}} {{creation}} and annihilation operators of a scalar field in Minkowski spacetime to obtain the generators of the SU(1, 1). We show that the transformation between Minkowski and Rindler vacua can be represented by (pseudo) rotation {{in the space of}} the SU(1, 1) group. The root of <b>this</b> <b>fact</b> originates from the coordinate transformation between Minkowski and Rindler manifolds that can also be represented as a (pseudo) rotation in SU(1, 1) group. The group structure reveals that an independent (pseudo) rotation in the group space must exist which leads to a new vacuum state, independent Rindler vacuum. The newly defined state shares many of the properties of the Rindler vacuum and, in particular, the theorem of thermalization remains valid for it. Keywords: Minkowski and Rindler vacua, thermal distribution, SU(1, 1) group – 1 – The discovery of a simple relationship of proportionality between temperature and the acceleration of a uniformly accelerated observer, first in the context of black holes [1], then for accelerated observers in Minkowski space-time [2], raised hopes for the unveiling of a deep connection between thermodynamics, quantum mechanics and eventually gravitation. An easy way to see that is by computing the vacuum expectation value of Rindler particle number operator in Minkowski vacuum; the distribution is Planckian (though only in even dimension spacetimes and for massless fields [3]). Even more, with these restrictions, the root mean square fluctuations are thermal. Here we are concerned with the algebra of {{the creation and}} annihilation operators of a scalar field in Minkowski and Rindler vacua. We show these operators can be combined so that they give the generators of the SU(1, 1) group. In this case, the transformation between the Minkowski and Rindler vacua is nothing else but a (pseudo) -rotation in the space of the SU(1, 1) group. <b>This</b> <b>fact</b> is intimately <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> the relation between the Minkowski and Rindler coordinates which transform under the fundamental representation of the group in the same way. In turn, this allows us to prove that the Rindler vacuum is not unique. To start with, we recall the connection between the Minkowski and Rindler vacua. They are linked by the transformatio...|$|R
