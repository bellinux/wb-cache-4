5|$|Basque {{people were}} the first to hunt right whales commercially, {{beginning}} as early as the 11th century in the Bay of Biscay. They initially sought oil, but as meat preservation technology improved, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> also used for food. Basque whalers reached eastern Canada by 1530 and the shores of Todos os Santos Bay (in Bahia, Brazil) by 1602. The last Basque voyages were made before the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). All attempts to revive the trade after the war failed. Basque shore whaling continued sporadically into the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles (born April 30, 1983) is {{a common}} chimpanzee, known for being the {{one-time}} companion animal of American recording artist Michael Jackson, who bought the primate from a Texas research facility in the early 1980s. <b>The</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> a frequent travel companion to the singer, whose attachment to the animal led to media mockery and, among other factors, a public perception of Jackson as eccentric. During the Bad world tour, for example, Jackson brought Bubbles with him to Japan, where they both drank tea with the mayor of Osaka.|$|E
5|$|During this episode, {{the dogs}} had to {{interact}} with the main characters, which proved difficult. Actor Sean Bean reported that for the final scene where he has to sacrifice Lady, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> too scared to remain still. They had to keep rehearsing the scene until the dog felt comfortable, making a shot that should have taken a few minutes about three hours long.|$|E
25|$|In most cases, the Purkinje neurons {{begin to}} die off shortly after <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> born and <b>the</b> {{condition}} <b>is</b> noticeable when <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> {{less than six}} months old, though sometimes the onset of symptoms <b>is</b> gradual and <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> much older before the owner or caretaker notices a problem.|$|R
30|$|After {{completing}} the catheterization, <b>the</b> sedated <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> transported for <b>the</b> experiment. <b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> kept warm during the experiments.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>animal</b> study {{protocol}} <b>was</b> {{approved by}} <b>the</b> Finnish National <b>Animal</b> Experiment Board, ELLA (Permit # ESAVI/ 3485 / 04.10. 03 / 2012). <b>The</b> <b>animal</b> experiments <b>were</b> {{carried out in}} <b>the</b> Central <b>Animal</b> Laboratory of <b>the</b> University of Turku. The institutional guidelines and the protocols for the analgesia, anesthesia, and housing of the rats were followed. Before surgery, the rats were acclimated to their new environment and fed a standard laboratory diet. <b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> housed in groups of two with constant room temperature. After surgery, the functional activity of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>was</b> not restricted. <b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> allowed free weight-bearing after recovery from anesthesia.|$|R
5|$|From a {{behavioral}} standpoint, {{one of the}} most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the Gobi Desert in 1971. It included a Velociraptor attacking a Protoceratops, providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other. Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially healed tail of an Edmontosaurus, a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged {{in such a way that}} shows <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived. Cannibalism amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in Madagascar in 2003, involving the theropod Majungasaurus.|$|E
5|$|Further work {{to improve}} {{the image of the}} town {{continues}} with the latest Central Basingstoke Vision project coordinated by the Borough Council. In the mid-1990s, numerous reports described sightings of the Beast of Basingstoke, a big cat believed to be a lion or a puma, possibly two. Local legend suggests <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> shot and killed, although no official news sources document any capture or killing of the beast.|$|E
5|$|Gigantic and {{visually}} impressive, the Megalosaurus {{became one of}} the park's three 'mascot dinosaurs' along with the Iguanodon and (less so) the Ichthyosaurs. Working from fragmentary evidence from Jurassic fossils found in England, consisting mainly of a hip and femur (thigh bone), with a rib and a few vertebrae, Owen conjectured <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> quadrupedal; palaeontologists now believe it to have been bipedal (standing like Tyrannosaurus rex). The first suggestion that some dinosaurs might have been bipedal came in 1858, just too late to influence the model.|$|E
30|$|All incisions {{were closed}} using {{interrupted}} silk sutures. At this point, {{the process of}} surgical interference <b>was</b> complete. Postoperatively, <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> administered 1  g of amoxicillin once daily for 5  days. Sutures were removed 14  days after surgery, and <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> fed a soft laboratory diet for the study duration. Further, the operated areas and general conditions of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> checked daily according to standard veterinary postoperative care.|$|R
50|$|In a judging ring, <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> will <b>be</b> walking. When <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> walking freely, <b>the</b> back hooves {{should step}} into the front hooves' footprints.|$|R
50|$|The S.F.A.A. {{follows the}} rules {{imposed by the}} International Game Fish Association related to the catch and release of <b>animals.</b> <b>The</b> release of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most {{important}} rule in <b>the</b> association, <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> not caught to not affect the marine fauna.|$|R
5|$|Histological {{analysis}} of the lines of arrested growth within the tibiae from the various ontogenetic stages of Limusaurus indicates that <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> skeletally mature at six years in age. In older specimens, the outermost lines of arrested growth are very close together (forming {{what is known as}} the external fundamental system), indicating that rapid growth had ceased in these particular individuals.|$|E
5|$|Koalas were hunted by {{indigenous}} Australians and {{depicted in}} myths and cave art for millennia. The first recorded encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798, and {{an image of}} <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> published in 1810 by naturalist George Perry. Botanist Robert Brown wrote the first detailed scientific description of the koala in 1814, although his work remained unpublished for 180 years. Popular artist John Gould illustrated and described the koala, introducing the species to the general British public. Further details about the animal's biology were revealed in the 19th century by several English scientists. Because of its distinctive appearance, the koala is recognised worldwide {{as a symbol of}} Australia. Koalas are listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The Australian government similarly lists specific populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable. <b>The</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> hunted heavily in the early 20th century for its fur, and large-scale cullings in Queensland resulted in a public outcry that initiated a movement to protect the species. Sanctuaries were established, and translocation efforts moved to new regions koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced. The biggest threat to their existence is habitat destruction caused by agriculture and urbanisation.|$|E
5|$|Majungasaurus was a {{main focus}} of the fifth episode of the mini-series When Dinosaurs Ruled hosted by Jeff Goldblum. It also {{featured}} in the pilot episode of Jurassic Fight Club, in which its cannibalistic behavior was explored. In both series, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> referred to as Majungatholus. It was properly referred to as Majungasaurus in the third episode of BBC's Planet Dinosaur, in which its killing technique {{as well as its}} cannibalistic nature were explored.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> an evenly light ochreous {{cream in}} color. The mantle {{is up to}} 30 mm long. <b>The</b> whole <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> up to 55 mm long.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> usually black.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> given human IgG, 250  mg/kg (Octapharma; Vienna, Austria), or IgGAM, 250  mg/kg (Pentaglobin; Biotest, Dreieich, Germany), {{intravenously}} via penile vein 5  min {{after the}} CLP procedure. After the IV injection, <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> placed {{back in their}} cages for recovery.|$|R
5|$|Marsh {{and then}} Hatcher assumed that <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> aquatic, {{because of the}} {{position}} of its nasal openings at the apex of the cranium. Similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. A 1951 study by Kenneth A. Kermack indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils {{when the rest of the}} body was submerged, as the water pressure on the chest wall would be too great. Since the 1970s, general consensus has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing on trees, ferns, and bushes.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists have {{proposed}} {{many ways in}} which the sail could have functioned in life. Some of the first to think about its purpose suggested that the sail may have served as camouflage among reeds while Dimetrodon waited for prey, or as an actual boat-like sail to catch the wind while <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> in the water. Another is that the long neural spines could have stabilized the trunk by restricting up-and-down movement, which would allow for a more efficient side-to-side movement while walking.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestor}} of Noronhomys {{may have been}} a semiaquatic animal, similar to living Holochilus or Lundomys, that arrived on Fernando de Noronha by chance on a floating log. The morphology of the limb bones in Noronhomys suggests that <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> not semiaquatic like its relatives, but terrestrial, consistent with its occurrence on a small island, where streams and pools are rare or absent.|$|E
50|$|Spoor {{can be used}} in hunting. For example, {{a hunter}} can stick their finger in an animal's scat to measure its temperature. If the scat <b>is</b> cold, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> likely far and if the scat <b>is</b> warm, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> likely close.|$|R
50|$|In {{the event}} of forfeiture, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> shelter may {{determine}} whether <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> suitable for adoption and if adoption can <b>be</b> arranged for <b>the</b> <b>animal.</b> <b>The</b> <b>animal</b> may not <b>be</b> adopted by the defendant or by any person residing in the defendant's household. If <b>the</b> adopted <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> a dog used for fighting, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> shelter shall notify any persons adopting the dog of the liability provisions for owners of dangerous dogs under Article 1A of Chapter 67 of the General Statutes. If no adoption can be arranged after the forfeiture, or <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> unsuitable for adoption, the shelter shall humanely euthanize <b>the</b> <b>animal.</b>|$|R
50|$|The body of <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> white.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> {{examined}} by scholars and the curious, and letters describing the fantastic creature {{were sent to}} correspondents throughout Europe. The earliest known image of the animal illustrates a poemetto by Florentine Giovanni Giacomo Penni, published in Rome on 13 July 1515, fewer than eight weeks after its arrival in Lisbon. The only known copy of the original published poem is held by the Institución Colombina in Seville.|$|E
5|$|A scapula (shoulder blade), only {{tentatively}} {{assigned to}} Plesiorycteropus, has the acromion, a process, present, but {{the structure is}} probably not as large as in aardvarks or armadillos. Six humeri have been found; the bone is robust and an entepicondylar foramen {{is present in the}} distal (far) end. There are three examples of the radius, a compact and massive bone in Plesiorycteropus which resembles the pangolin radius. The three known ulnae show that the olecranon process at the proximal (near) end is well-developed, but the distal end is narrow; the morphology of the bone suggests that <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> capable of producing much force with its arms.|$|E
5|$|Abyssobrotula galatheae, {{a species}} of cusk eel in the family Ophidiidae, is among the deepest-living species of fish. In 1970, one {{specimen}} was trawled from a depth of 8370meters in the Puerto Rico Trench. <b>The</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> dead, however, upon arrival at the surface. In 2008, the hadal snailfish (Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis) was observed and recorded {{at a depth of}} 7700meters in the Japan Trench. These are, to date, the deepest living fish ever recorded. Other fish of the abyssal zone include the fishes of the Ipnopidae family, which includes the abyssal spiderfish (Bathypterois longipes), tripodfish (Bathypterois grallator), feeler fish (Bathypterois longifilis), and the black lizardfish (Bathysauropsis gracilis). Some members of this family have been recorded from depths of more than 6000meters.|$|E
50|$|American Humane {{certifies}} farms after evaluating {{them on a}} five point criteria. The criteria {{demands that}} <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> free from hunger, discomfort, pain, and fear, and that <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> able to express normal behaviors. Farms that meet this criteria receive an American Humane Certified label.|$|R
50|$|Old McDonald's Farm This {{replaced}} the Reindeer Barn and consolidated all of <b>the</b> roaming <b>animals</b> to one {{spot in the}} park. It had attractions such as the Pony Ride, Petting Zoo, and <b>Animal</b> Pens where <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> stored at night. <b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> sold in 2004 before the park closed in 2006.|$|R
50|$|A crush is a {{permanent}} fixture in slaughterhouses, because <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> carried on a conveyor restrainer under its belly, with its legs dangling in a slot on either side. Carried in this manner, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> unable to move either forward or backward by its own volition.|$|R
5|$|Although it {{was once}} widely {{believed}} that coyotes are recent immigrants to southern Mexico and Central America, aided in their expansion by deforestation, Pleistocene and Early Holocene records, as well as records from the pre-Columbian period and early European colonization show that <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> present in the area long before modern times. Nevertheless, range expansion did occur south of Costa Rica during the late 1970s and northern Panama in the early 1980s, following the expansion of cattle-grazing lands into tropical rainforests. The coyote is predicted to appear in northern Belize in the near future, as the habitat there is favorable to the species. Concerns have been raised of a possible expansion into South America through the Panamanian Isthmus, should the Darién Gap ever be closed by the Pan-American Highway. This fear was partially confirmed in January 2013, when the species was recorded in eastern Panama's Chepo District, beyond the Panama Canal.|$|E
5|$|Elephants exhibit mirror self-recognition, an {{indication}} of self-awareness and cognition that has also been demonstrated in some apes and dolphins. One study of a captive female Asian elephant suggested <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> capable of learning and distinguishing between several visual and some acoustic discrimination pairs. This individual was even able to score a high accuracy rating when re-tested with the same visual pairs a year later. Elephants are among the species known to use tools. An Asian elephant has been observed modifying branches and using them as flyswatters. Tool modification by these animals is not as advanced as that of chimpanzees. Elephants are popularly thought of as having an excellent memory. This could have a factual basis; they possibly have cognitive maps {{to allow them to}} remember large-scale spaces over long periods of time. Individuals appear {{to be able to keep}} track of the current location of their family members.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs (called cuy, cuye, or curí) were {{originally}} domesticated for their {{meat in the}} Andes. Traditionally, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s, {{it has become more}} socially acceptable for consumption by all people. It continues to be {{a major part of the}} diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the Sierra) and Colombia. Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cattle; moreover, they can be raised in an urban environment. Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs.|$|E
