Its CAS number is 9004-38-0. It is a hygroscopic white to off-white free-flowing powder, granules, or flakes. It is tasteless and odorless, though may have a weak odor of acetic acid.

Divanillyl oxalate, a more eco-friendly or [...] "green" [...] oxalate for chemiluminescence, decomposes into the nontoxic, biodegradable compound vanillin and works in nontoxic, biodegradable <b>triacetin</b> 16 [...] Peroxyoxalate CL is an example of indirect or sensitized chemiluminescence in which the energy from an excited intermediate is transferred to a suitable fluorescent molecule, which relaxes to the ground state by emitting a photon. Rauhut and co-workers have reported that the intermediate responsible for providing the energy of excitation is 1,2-dioxetanedione 1,3. The peroxyoxalate reaction is able to excite many different compounds, having emissions spanning the visible and infrared regions of the spectrum 3,4, and the reaction can supply up to 440 kJ mol-1, corresponding to excitation at 272 nm 5. It has been found, however, that the chemiluminescence intensity corrected for quantum yield decreases as the singlet excitation energy of the fluorescent molecule increases 6. There is also a linear relationship between the corrected chemiluminescence intensity and the oxidation potential of the molecule 6. This suggests the possibility of an electron transfer step in the mechanism, as demonstrated in several other chemiluminescence systems 7-10. It has been postulated that a transient charge transfer complex is formed between the intermediate 1,2-dioxetanedione and the fluorescer 11, and a modified mechanism was proposed involving the transfer of an electron from the fluorescer to the reactive intermediate 12. The emission of light is thought to result from the annihilation of the fluorescer radical cation with the carbon dioxide radical anion formed when the 1,2-dioxetanedione decomposes 13. This process is called chemically induced electron exchange luminescence (CIEEL).|$|E
