A bypass {{to the north of}} Tylertown was built for US 98 in 1985. US 98 was moved to a new alignment <b>to</b> <b>bypass</b> Lucedale in 1988. In 1996, US 98 was routed out of Beaumont and McLain {{as a result of the}} construction of a new alignment on a divided highway. By1998, MS198 was marked on the six former alignments of US 98 in Tylertown, Columbia, Hattiesburg, Beaumont, McLain, and Lucedale. In 2005, the eastern terminus of the McLain section of MS 198 was truncated from US 98 to MS 57.|$|E

40|$|Assessing {{response}} <b>to</b> {{treatment with}} <b>bypassing</b> agents presents a substantial {{challenge in the}} treatment of patients with haemophilia and inhibitors. Rapid and accurate identification of bleeding episodes that are non-responsive <b>to</b> <b>bypassing</b> therapy with either Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Activity (FEIBA; Baxter AG) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa; NovoSeven, Novo Nordisk A/S) is essential to guide treatment decisions and optimize patient outcomes through early intervention. Although both bypassing agents are effective, differential responses to therapy necessitate multiple therapeutic options. This article provides a consensus definition for non–lifethreatening joint and muscle bleeds that are nonresponsive <b>to</b> <b>bypassing</b> agents. An international panel of seven physicians met in December 2008 to develop the consensus definition using a modified National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference method. The consequent definition of non–lifethreatening bleeding episodes that are non-responsive <b>to</b> <b>bypassing</b> treatment provides a global picture of the condition of the patient during such an event. Identification of non-responsiveness is based on various criteria: pain, swelling/tension, mobility, patient perception and laboratory parameters. Criteria can be assessed subjectively by the patient/parent and/or objectively by the clinician. Although the precise timing of each determination should be at the discretion of the physician, bleeds should be considered non-responsive if the clinical situation meets the specified criteria 24 h from the start of treatment. Although it is not intended to replace clinical judgment, this definition can guide the optimal course of treatment for patients with haemophilia and inhibitors...|$|R

For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|E

5|$|Around 1959, M-43 was shifted <b>to</b> <b>bypass</b> Grand Ledge. The former {{route through}} town was {{retained}} {{as a state}} highway, designated Bus. M-43. M-43 was extended from its eastern end in Lansing in 1962 along a section of highway that was formerly part of US16 on Grand River Avenue; the extension to Webberville was made when the I-96 freeway opened that year. Through the Lansing area, M-43 was rerouted off Michigan Avenue downtown. This former routing was renumbered M-143.|$|E

Instead of following Willow Point Road, the highway remained on modern Gate Hill Road to {{the vicinity of}} Stony Point, where it entered the hamlet on Main Street. It was rerouted again between 1968 and 1973 <b>to</b> <b>bypass</b> Main Street to the south on Central Drive.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIntroduction: Assessing {{response}} <b>to</b> {{treatment with}} <b>bypassing</b> agents presents a substantial {{challenge in the}} treatment of patients with haemophilia and inhibitors. Rapid and accurate identification of bleeding episodes that are nonresponsive <b>to</b> <b>bypassing</b> therapy with either Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Activity (FEIBA; Baxter AG, Vienna, Austria) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa; NovoSeven®, Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) is essential to guide treatment decisions and optimise patient outcomes through early intervention.

5|$|Cochrane {{had several}} {{disputes}} with San Martín. He discussed {{several of his}} actions and tried <b>to</b> <b>bypass</b> his authority. During the blockade of El Callao, he proposed that O'Higgins {{take control of the}} mission and send any spoils of battle to Chile. As San Martín was appointed Protector of Peru, Cochrane reasoned that San Martín was no longer under Chilean command, and took the navy away. In later years Cochrane made accusations against San Martín in Chile.|$|E
