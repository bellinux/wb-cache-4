5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the Kaiman-class <b>torpedo</b> boats were split between the 1st and 2nd <b>Torpedo</b> Craft Flotillas, based at Cattaro and Pola respectively. In the 1st <b>Torpedo</b> Craft Flotilla, the 3rd <b>Torpedo</b> Craft Division had two groups of Kaiman-class boats: 50 E, 51 T and 73 F made up the 2nd <b>Torpedo</b> Boat Group, and 53 T, 54 T and 56 T made up the 3rd <b>Torpedo</b> Boat Group. In the 2nd <b>Torpedo</b> Craft Flotilla, the 5th <b>Torpedo</b> Craft Division had three groups of the class: 55 T, 68 F and 70 F made up the 4th <b>Torpedo</b> Boat Group; 61 T, 65 F and 66 F comprised the 5th <b>Torpedo</b> Boat Group; and 64 F, 69 F and 72 F made up the 6th <b>Torpedo</b> Boat Group. Also in the 2nd <b>Torpedo</b> Craft Flotilla, the 6th <b>Torpedo</b> Craft Division had three more groups of Kaiman-class boats: 52 T, 58 T and 59 T were in the 7th <b>Torpedo</b> Boat Group; 60 T, 62 T and 63 T made up the 8th <b>Torpedo</b> Boat Group; and 57 T, 67 F and 72 F comprised the 9th <b>Torpedo</b> Boat Group.|$|E
5|$|In October 1916, the Flanders Flotilla {{was finally}} {{reinforced}} by the German Admiralty with two full <b>torpedo</b> boat flotillas. The transfer of the 3rd and 9th <b>Torpedo</b> Boat Flotillas to Flanders had immediate consequences to {{the balance of power}} in the Dover Strait. Whereas before, the Flanders Flotilla had been equipped with only three large <b>torpedo</b> boats and several of the smaller inferior A-class <b>torpedo</b> boats, they now possessed 23large <b>torpedo</b> boats capable of meeting the British Dover Patrol in combat. Due to the lack of large <b>torpedo</b> boats, the Flanders Flotilla had not sortied against the Dover Patrol in several months and as a result British defences were quite lax in the area.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the planned role as a tender for <b>torpedo</b> boats, she was also intended {{to serve as a}} test platform for the new self-propelled <b>torpedo.</b> Up to the mid-1870s, the German navy had only experimented with a handful of <b>torpedo</b> ships, all of which were equipped with the old spar <b>torpedo.</b> The ship's design provided the basis for both later German avisosthe and all subsequent light cruisers, but also to numerous foreign designs, such as several classes of French, Italian, and Austrian avisos and <b>torpedo</b> craft.|$|E
50|$|Also {{referred}} to as conventional <b>torpedoes,</b> spatial <b>torpedoes</b> are 22nd century weapons used by Enterprise. Spatial <b>torpedoes</b> are the ship's most powerful and primary ship-to-ship weapon before the installation of phase cannons. Spatial <b>torpedoes</b> are themselves superseded by more powerful photonic <b>torpedoes.</b> Unlike photonic <b>torpedoes</b> {{or any of the}} warhead's successors, spatial <b>torpedoes</b> are launched at sub-light velocity and can be used much {{in the manner of a}} missile, having the warhead on a fly-by-wire.|$|R

5|$|Within {{the genus}} <b>Torpedo,</b> the marbled {{electric}} ray belongs to the subgenus <b>Torpedo,</b> which differs from the other subgenus Tetronarce in having fringed margins on their spiracles and generally ornate dorsal coloration. Other common names for this species include common crampfish, marbled <b>torpedo,</b> numbfish, and spotted <b>torpedo.</b>|$|E
5|$|Almost {{as soon as}} the war began, {{submarine}} captains indicated {{there were}} problems with the Mark 14 <b>torpedo</b> and the influence feature of the Mark 6 exploder. Torpedoes would fail to explode, or explode prematurely. Despite these reports, Christie was not fully aware {{of the impact of the}} situation, because his S-boats used the older Mark 10 <b>torpedo,</b> with a contact-only pistol. Christie acknowledged Mark 14s were running deeper than set, but attributed the failures to poor maintenance and errors on the part of the captain and crew. He was convinced the Mark 6 was satisfactory, and ordered all fleet boats to continue to use it. In November 1942, Christie was ordered to return to Newport as Inspector of Ordnance at the <b>Torpedo</b> Station. Newport had become a bottleneck for <b>torpedo</b> manufacture, and the Bureau of Ordnance wanted to advance development of the Mark 18 electric <b>torpedo.</b> Christie resisted leaving his command at Brisbane, but was considered of more use to resolve the <b>torpedo</b> issue. He was replaced by Captain James Fife. For his service at Brisbane, Christie was awarded the Legion of Merit.|$|E

5|$|At 05:13 on 5 August, Bridgeports lookouts spotted Ushant Light. At 06:40, SC-48 sighted a <b>torpedo</b> {{and sounded}} a warning. Two minutes later, men {{on board the}} tender saw the <b>torpedo</b> wake on Bridgeports port quarter. Orders came down for full left rudder and full speed ahead. Bridgeport swung barely out of harm's way as men on her stern {{observed}} the <b>torpedo</b> disappear {{on the port side}} and reappear to starboard. It passed five feet astern, barely clearing the rudder. The starboard battery fired one shot {{in the direction of the}} torpedo—which broached on the starboard quarter—while the port guns fired in the direction from which the <b>torpedo</b> had come. Meanwhile, two destroyers, with a number of subchasers, hurried toward the spot where the <b>torpedo</b> wake had apparently begun and dropped depth charges. Bridgeport ceased fire and resumed her place in the formation. Through all this activity, no one actually saw the submarine that had fired the <b>torpedo.</b>|$|E
5|$|By May 1938, Christie {{was head}} of the <b>Torpedo</b> Section at BuOrd and {{involved}} in providing torpedoes to the fleet. He would take command of Newport <b>Torpedo</b> Station in 1943, shortly before the death of Admiral Robert English on 21 January 1943.|$|E
5|$|Her six <b>torpedo</b> tubes {{came from}} a {{cancelled}} L-class submarine and she was provided with one reload for each tube. It took some 24 minutes to reload them all because space in the <b>torpedo</b> room was restricted.|$|E
50|$|<b>Torpedoes</b> {{were fired}} up Loch Long from tubes {{at the front}} of the facility. A boat stood by to recover the (unarmed) <b>torpedoes</b> where they were {{returned}} for analysis. The now roofless shed to the left and the main part of the building have tracks where <b>torpedoes</b> were stored and worked on. Hoists on the first floor lowered the <b>torpedoes</b> into the tubes.|$|R
50|$|Early on 11 November, west of Yevpatoria, Shch-215 fired two <b>torpedoes</b> at an {{unidentified}} merchant ship, {{both of which}} missed. Two hours later Shch-215 fired two more <b>torpedoes</b> at a merchant ship, probably the same vessel, but again both missed. Early on 15 November off Cape Tarkhankut, Shch-215 fired two <b>torpedoes</b> at a German convoy of barges and smaller vessels. Four hours later she fired two <b>torpedoes,</b> sinking the German barge F 592. The next day, west of Yevpatoria, Shch-215 fired two <b>torpedoes</b> at the German minesweeper MT 1, both of which missed.|$|R
50|$|In the PT {{attack that}} followed, fifteen boats loaded with 60 <b>torpedoes</b> counted {{only a few}} {{observed}} explosions. However, of the thirty <b>torpedoes</b> fired by PT boats from the four divisions not a single hit was scored. Many of the <b>torpedoes</b> exploded prematurely or ran at the wrong depth. The boats were ordered to return when their <b>torpedoes</b> were expended, but the boats with radar shot their <b>torpedoes</b> first. When they left, the remaining boats, including PT-109, were left without radar, and were not notified that other boats had already engaged the enemy.|$|R
5|$|In 1903, {{secondary}} batteries {{were typically}} {{considered to be}} a combination of <b>torpedo</b> defense—defense against smaller boats armed with torpedoes, such as <b>torpedo</b> boats or destroyers—and weapons to attack the lightly armored upper structures of capital ships.|$|E
5|$|The 1st <b>Torpedo</b> Division {{consisted}} of the flotilla leader Dubrovnik {{and two of the}} three Beograd-class destroyers, and was based at Kotor. The remaining Beograd-class destroyer, Ljubljana, was under repair at Šibenik {{at the time of the}} invasion. The 2nd and 3rd <b>Torpedo</b> Division {{consisted of}} <b>torpedo</b> boats, and were both based at Šibenik.|$|E
5|$|The Mark 50 <b>torpedo</b> stored {{chemical}} energy propulsion system (SCEPS) uses a small tank of sulfur hexafluoride gas, which is sprayed over {{a block of}} solid lithium. The reaction generates heat, creating steam to propel the <b>torpedo</b> in a closed Rankine cycle.|$|E
25|$|On 8 August 1941 Vetehinen {{launched}} two <b>torpedoes</b> at a 1500-ton freighter, {{but neither}} of the <b>torpedoes</b> exploded.|$|R
50|$|On {{her third}} patrol between 5 February and 28 February she <b>torpedoed</b> and damaged the British {{converted}} boom carrier Laomedon 45 miles SE of Ceylon. In the Arabian Sea on 15 February she <b>torpedoed</b> and sank the 4,681-ton Johanne Justesen and on 20 February in the Indian Ocean, <b>torpedoed</b> and sank the 5,280-ton British merchant Bhima. She attacked another merchant ship on 21 February, but missed with her <b>torpedoes.</b>|$|R
500|$|The I-351-class {{submarines}} {{were initially}} equipped to carry [...] of aviation gasoline, [...] of fresh water, and either sixty [...] bombs or 30 bombs and 15 aircraft <b>torpedoes.</b> Four of the <b>torpedoes</b> could {{be replaced by}} {{an equal number of}} reload <b>torpedoes</b> for the submarine.|$|R
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray {{was described by}} American ichthyologist William Orville Ayres, the first Curator of Ichthyology at the California Academy of Sciences, who named it after the U.S. state where it was first discovered by science. Ayers published his account in 1855, in the inaugural volume of the Academy's Proceedings; no type specimens were designated. In 1861, Theodore Gill placed this species in his newly created genus Tetronarce, {{on the basis of}} its smooth-rimmed spiracles. Later authors have generally regarded Tetronarce as a subgenus of <b>Torpedo.</b> Closely similar {{electric ray}}s found off Peru, Chile, and Japan may be the same as this species. Other common names used for this ray include California <b>torpedo</b> ray, Pacific <b>torpedo,</b> or simply electric ray or <b>torpedo</b> ray. This species is placed in the genus Tetronarce.|$|E
5|$|The factory {{recognised}} {{his talent}} {{from a young}} age: Streltsov became the Fraser Factory football team's youngest ever player when he was 13 years old. Three years later in 1953, a friendly match was organised between Fraser and a youth team from <b>Torpedo</b> Moscow. Streltsov impressed the <b>Torpedo</b> coach, Vasily Provornov, and after befriending him, left Fraser to play for <b>Torpedo.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{armed with a}} main battery of four /35 caliber guns guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The {{secondary}} battery consisted of fourteen /40 caliber Mark IV guns, which were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against <b>torpedo</b> boats, she carried sixteen 6-pounder guns mounted in casemates {{along the side of}} the hull and six 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, Wisconsin carried four 21 inch (533 mm) <b>torpedo</b> tubes in deck mounted <b>torpedo</b> launchers.|$|E
50|$|The Indian Navy's USD300 million {{purchase}} of 98 <b>torpedoes</b> from WASS (a Finmeccanica/Leonardo company) remains suspended, {{as it is}} linked to the ongoing investigation into the EUR750 million (USD861 million) import of 12 AW101 helicopters from AgustaWestland (a Finmeccanica company facing corruption charges). The Defense minister Manohar Parikkar under the new NDA government, said that the <b>torpedoes</b> for the submarine will be procured from other companies. The submarine will be able to be armed with MBDA's tube-launched Exocet SM-39 anti-ship missiles. The SeaHake <b>torpedoes</b> from Germany's Atlas Elektronik and France's F21 <b>torpedoes</b> may be considered. Indigenous <b>torpedoes</b> are under development by the DRDO and await testing. DRDO is given the go ahead to make indigenous <b>torpedoes</b> for both Scorpene class and Kilo class of submarines.|$|R
40|$|<b>Torpedoes,</b> swellings of the {{proximal}} Purkinje cell axon, {{are thought to}} represent a cellular response to injury [3]. They may occur {{in a variety of}} cerebellar disorders [7]. Most recently, their numbers were noted to be six-times higher in essential tremor (ET) than control brains [4]. <b>Torpedoes</b> are also often viewed as a cumulative phenomenon associated with advanced aging [3, 4], yet there are surprisingly few supporting data. We quantified <b>torpedoes</b> in normal human cerebella spanning a considerable age range to assess whether <b>torpedoes</b> are a cumulative phenomenon of aging. These data help place the relative abundance of <b>torpedoes</b> in ET in context...|$|R

5|$|The torpedoes {{initially}} had {{a similar}} system where various rangefinders, especially the fifteen-foot rangefinder above the aft <b>torpedo</b> control tower, and deflection sights provided data to a Dreyer table in the <b>torpedo</b> TS adjacent to the 5.5-inch TS on the lower deck. However the Dreyer table was removed during Hoods 1929–1931 refit and the calculations {{were made in the}} <b>torpedo</b> control position in the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Twenty minutes later, the 16 Zuikaku <b>torpedo</b> planes {{arrived and}} split up to attack Enterprise. One group of <b>torpedo</b> bombers was {{attacked}} by two CAP Wildcats which shot down three of them and damaged a fourth. On fire, the fourth damaged aircraft purposely crashed into the destroyer , setting the ship on fire and killing 57 of her crew. The <b>torpedo</b> carried by this aircraft detonated shortly after impact, causing more damage. The fires initially seemed out of control until Smiths commanding officer ordered the destroyer to steer into the large spraying wake of the battleship , which helped put out the fires. Smith then resumed her station, firing her remaining anti-aircraft guns at the <b>torpedo</b> planes.|$|E
