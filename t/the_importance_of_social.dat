In a 2017 study involving Bombus terrestris, bees were taught to complete an unnatural task of moving large objects to obtain a reward. Bees that first observed another bee complete the task were significantly more successful in learning the task than bees that observed the same action performed by a magnet, indicating <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> information. The bees did not copy each other exactly: in fact, the study suggested that the bees were instead attempting to emulate each other's goals.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunication {{has played}} a {{significant}} role in social relationships. Nevertheless, devices like the telephone system were originally advertised with an emphasis on the practical dimensions of the device (such as the ability to conduct business or order home services) as opposed to the social dimensions. It was not until the late 1920s and 1930s that the social dimensions of the device became a prominent theme in telephone advertisements. New promotions started appealing to consumers' emotions, stressing <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> conversations and staying connected to family and friends.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{theory has}} {{implications}} in residence and contact disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus {{focusing on the}} quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along {{with the impact of}} step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{critique}} of the article by Robin Perry in this issue that describes a study in Florida to compare supervi-sor and peer performance evaluations of child welfare staff. An overview of prior studies related to <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> work degree is provided. Subsequently, selected technical, design issues, and results in the Perry study are identified and discussed. Issues and speculations about the validity of supervisor and peer ratings in Perry’s study and other studies are addressed. Finally, a discussion of the need to broaden perspectives on <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> work degree is included. Perry’s results indicate more about the invalidity of supervisor and peer ratings of child welfare staff performance than anything about <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> work degree for effective job perfor-mance. Perry’s study focused on a narrow issue pertaining to a larger set of issues...|$|R

5|$|Sociological {{reasoning}} pre-dates {{the foundation}} of the discipline. Social analysis has origins in the common stock of Western knowledge and philosophy, and has been carried out from {{as far back as the}} time of ancient Greek philosopher Plato, if not before. The origin of the survey, i.e., the collection of information from a sample of individuals, can be traced back to at least the Domesday Book in 1086, while ancient philosophers such as Confucius wrote on <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> roles. There is evidence of early sociology in medieval Arab writings. Some sources consider Ibn Khaldun, a 14th-century Arab Islamic scholar from North Africa (Tunisia), to have been the first sociologist and father of sociology (see Branches of the early Islamic philosophy); his Muqaddimah was perhaps the first work to advance social-scientific reasoning on social cohesion and social conflict.|$|E

(Unless otherwise indicated, the account below is based on Hume's influential Development of English Drama in the Late Seventeenth Century, 1976.)

25|$|Some of Harlow's final {{experiments}} explored social deprivation {{in the quest}} to create an animal model {{for the study of}} depression. This study is the most controversial, and involved isolation of infant and juvenile macaques for various periods of time. Monkeys placed in isolation exhibited social deficits when introduced or re-introduced into a peer group. They appeared unsure of how to interact with their conspecifics, and mostly stayed separate from the group, demonstrating <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> interaction and stimuli in forming the ability to interact with conspecifics in developing monkeys, and, comparatively, in children.|$|E
25|$|Changing social {{circumstances}} {{have greatly}} diversified {{the life of}} the salaryman outside of work. Though <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> drinking has not declined, its image has changed over time from mass partying during the economic bubble to conservative consumption at home {{after the collapse of the}} economy during the 1990s. Mahjong was an immensely popular game among the 1960s generation of salarymen, who brought the game into company circles directly from high school and college groups. The 1970s generation saw a gradual decrease in the number of avid mahjong players, and by the 1980s, it became common to not show any interest at all. Some current salarymen do not partake in the game.|$|E
25|$|All {{the sites}} of Ashokan {{inscription}} were chosen carefully {{to ensure that they}} were accessible to large numbers of people. These edicts are proclamations to the public at large. They explain the idea of Dhamma. One must make a distinction between Ashoka's policy of Dhamma which stressed social responsibility and Ashoka's own commitment as a Buddhist. There has been a tendency in the past among historians to study the policy of Dhamma and Ashoka as Buddhist in the same context without making any distinction. An examination of the inscriptions suggests that Ashoka declared his personal association with a Buddhist order and on the other he tried to teach, through the policy of Dhamma, <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> responsibility and tolerance amongst different members of the society.|$|E

500|$|Throughout his career, Durkheim was {{concerned}} primarily with three goals. First, to establish sociology {{as a new}} academic discipline. Second, to analyze how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in the modern era, when things such as shared religious and ethnic background {{could no longer be}} assumed; to that end he wrote much about the effect of laws, religion, education and similar forces on society and social integration.

500|$|One-nation {{conservatism}} {{was first}} conceived by the Conservative British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, who presented his political philosophy in two novels– Sybil, Or The Two Nations and Coningsby– published in 1845 and 1844 respectively. Disraeli's conservatism proposed a paternalistic society {{with the social}} classes intact but with the working class receiving support from the establishment. He emphasised <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> obligation rather than the individualism that pervaded his society.
