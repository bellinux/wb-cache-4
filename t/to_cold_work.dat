30|$|The {{manufacturing}} process for CFS sections can create {{significant changes in}} the material properties, particularly near the corners, in a phenomenon typically referred <b>to</b> as <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> of forming.

50|$|The {{increase}} in strength due to strain hardening {{is comparable to}} that of heat treating. Therefore, it is sometimes more economical <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> a less costly and weaker metal than to hot work a more expensive metal that can be heat treated, especially if precision or a fine surface finish is required as well. The cold working process also reduces waste as compared to machining, or even eliminates with near net shape methods. The material savings becomes even more significant at larger volumes, and even more so when using expensive materials, such as copper, nickel, gold, tantalum, and palladium. The saving on raw material as a result of cold forming can be very significant, as is saving machining time. Production cycle times when cold working are very short. On multi-station machinery, production cycle times are even less. This can be very advantageous for large production runs.|$|E

The cold rolling {{has been carried out}} in between 12 - 28 % and was annealed at various temperatures in the range of 225 - 325 °C for 5 min. Hardness test and tensile tests were carried out to evaluate tensile and ductility parameters.

It has been observed that the cold rolling has a significant effect on the increase in the yield strength and lowering the ductility of the alloy.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the {{mechanical}} behavior of warm rolled high magnesium aluminum-magnesium alloys have shown that excellent tensile properties can be developed in these materials. Several questions raised in these previous efforts regarding recrystallization and precipitation of the intermetallic 3 phase are addressed in this thesis. It is shown that, for temperatures T < T (where T is the solvus temperature) the only microstructural change is the precipitation of the 3 phase and no recrystallization occurs, even with prior cold work. Further studies of microstructures developed during warm working, with and without prior cold work, also indicate that precipitation and recovery dominate the microstructural changes in warm rolling at temperatures below the solvus for the alloy. Recrystallization will occur readily, but only at temperature {{in excess of the}} solvus.

Metallurgical evaluation suggested that the mode of failure was localized attack by chlorine and/or hydrochloric acid at pipe connections (flanges) where concentrated solutions could accumulate. Most evidence pointed out that the failure resulted from corrosion attack due to condensation of hydrochloric acid.

The motivation for this research is the systematic investigation of the elastic and plastic deformation of TiAl 6 V 4 at different strain rates. To investigate the influence of the strain rate on the mechanical response (e. g., energy absorption) of TiAl 6 V 4 structures, compression tests on TiAl 6 V 4 -lattice structures with different strain rates are carried out to determine the mechanical response from the resulting stress-strain curves. Results are compared to the mechanical response of stainless steel lattice structures (316 L). It is shown that heat-treated TiAl 6 V 4 specimens have a larger breaking strain and a lower drop of stress after failure initiation. Main finding is that TiAl 6 V 4 lattice structures show brittle behavior and low energy absorption capabilities compared to the ductile behaving 316 L lattice structures.

40|$|Tin {{whiskers}} {{found in}} electroplated deposits {{are known to}} be single crystals which spontaneously grow. Thus whisker growth can be regarded as a grain growth phenomenon. In this paper we examine whisker grain growth {{in the context of the}} well-developed principles of recrystallization process as applied to bulk metals that have undergone deformation and annealing. As a grain grows in whisker form, recrystallization process must take place as tin atoms rearrange in to the lattice structure of the elongating grain. Peculiarities of tin deposit structure that may cause whisker growth are discussed. Frank-Read source of dislocations is proposed as a possible mechanism for whisker formation. The effect of various factors on whiskering is analyzed. Recrystallization theory postulates that shear strain introduced by plastic deformation is stored in the metal in the form of dislocations (lattice defects). In bulk metals, produced metallurgically from the molten phase, these lattice defects usually are not present in noticeable quantity unless the material is subjected <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> (plastic deformation at temperatures significantly below melting point).

40|$|Abstract: Two {{internal}} friction peaks discovered in pure aluminum at increasingly low temperatures, respectively by Lax and Filson and by Kosugi and Kino, are interpreted as different occurrences {{of the very}} same mechanism responsible for the better-known Bordoni peak, namely the nucleation of thermal kink pairs. Most f. c. c. metals subjected <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> develop a number of peaks in the curve of {{internal friction}} (IF) versus temperature [1, 2]. The most prominent maximum (Bordoni peak [3]) and its subsidiary (Niblett-Wilks peak [2]) were detected first almost fifty {{years ago in the}} range 50 - 100 K. Since then, a variety of less pronounced peaks were discovered both at higher (Hasiguti peaks [1, 4]) and lower temperatures. Two types of IF peaks have been reproduced systematically (mostly in pure aluminum) by lowering the temperature, namely the Lax-Filson (LF) [5] and the Kosugi- Kino (KK) peak [6]. Most properties of these peaks resemble those detailed for the Bordoni peak [I- 3, 7]. The Bordoni peak is currently interpreted [1, 2] as the signature of one or more relaxation processes taking place in the lattice dislocation network [8].

50|$|Shock {{hardening}} is {{a process}} used to strengthen metals and alloys, wherein a shock wave produces atomic-scale defects in the material's crystalline structure. As in <b>cold</b> <b>work,</b> these defects interfere with the normal processes by which metallic materials yield (plasticity), making materials stiffer, but more brittle. When compared <b>to</b> traditional <b>cold</b> <b>work,</b> such an extremely rapid process results in a different class of defect, producing a much harder material for a given change in shape. If the shock wave applies too great a force for too long, however, the rarefaction front that follows it can form voids in the material due to hydrostatic tension, weakening the material and often causing it to spall. Since voids nucleate at large defects, such as oxide inclusions and grain boundaries, high-purity samples with a large grain size (especially single crystals) are able to withstand greater shock without spalling, and can therefore be made much harder.|$|R
