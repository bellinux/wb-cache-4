5|$|Duquesne {{lost only}} one starter, Aaron Jackson, from the 2008–09 team which {{ended with a}} record of 21–13, the first time since 1981 that the school had 20 or more wins in a season. Picked to finish 12th in the Atlantic 10, Duquesne went on to finish second, losing to Temple by only five points in the conference {{championship}} game. This earned Duquesne a bid into the National Invitation Tournament, its first postseason appearance since 1994. The team was eliminated in a double-overtime first round loss to Virginia Tech, but the Dukes' unlikely success inspired <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> return to the NIT, or perhaps even the NCAA tournament.|$|E
5|$|The rebel {{leaders were}} quickly rounded up. A rebel leader {{by the name}} of Jack Straw was {{captured}} in London and executed. John Ball was caught in Coventry, tried in St Albans, and executed on 15 July. Grindecobbe was also tried and executed in St Albans. John Wrawe was tried in London; he probably gave evidence against 24 of his colleagues in <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pardon, but was sentenced to be executed by being hanged, drawn and quartered on 6 May 1382. Sir Roger Bacon was probably arrested before the final battle in Norfolk, and was tried and imprisoned in the Tower of London before finally being pardoned by the Crown. As of September 1381, Thomas Ingleby of Bridgwater had successfully evaded the authorities.|$|E
5|$|On 18 January, Marsden arrests Ian after Janine {{told her}} that Ian took {{advantage}} of her, stole Archie's laptop, which had a recording of them having sex on it, and dumped it in the canal. Ian refuses to talk, but when Marsden shows him CCTV footage of him dumping the laptop, and then shows him the recovered laptop, he admits visiting Archie on Christmas Day, claiming that Archie was threatening him. He wanted to delete the recording and denies murdering Archie, but Marsden charges him. Days later, Janine tells Marsden she saw Ian leave the Queen Victoria on Christmas Day but the bust of Queen Victoria was on the bar after he left. Marsden places Janine at the scene, but she also denies murdering Archie. Marsden tells Ian that although the murder charge will be dropped, he will still be charged with burglary and theft of Archie's laptop. She and DC Wayne Hughes (Jamie Treacher) attend Archie's funeral, watching people's reactions in <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new lead. Peggy returns to Archie's grave; when Marsden asks why, she explains that she didn't believe him when he said his cancer had returned.|$|E

25|$|Philip {{was also}} much {{disturbed}} by the internal conflicts that arose after Luther's death between his followers and the disciples of Melanchthon.

Ruthven had been unwilling to wait for reinforcements sent by Stamford to arrive and had marched to face the Royalists in <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quick victory. Ruthven initially believed he was facing stragglers from Hopton's main army but was instead lured into facing the entire Royalist force.|$|E

She claimed to have attempted suicide twice and survived. The Suicide attempts made her stronger to either leave Nigeria to a more tolerant society or to succeed in killing herself in the third suicide attempt.|$|E
25|$|The {{disease is}} {{diagnosed}} by biopsy done by an endoscope (a fiberoptic camera). Prevention includes stopping smoking and eating a healthy diet. Treatment {{is based on}} the cancer's stage and location, together with the person's general condition and individual preferences. Small localized squamous-cell cancers may be treated with surgery alone with <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cure. In most other cases, chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy is used along with surgery. Larger tumors may have their growth slowed with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In the presence of extensive disease or if the affected person is not fit enough to undergo surgery, palliative care is often recommended.|$|E
25|$|For {{most people}} with CLL, it is incurable by present {{treatment}}s, so treatment is directed towards suppressing the disease for many years, rather than totally and permanently eliminating it. The primary chemotherapeutic plan is combination chemotherapy with chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide, plus a corticosteroid such as prednisone or prednisolone. The use of a corticosteroid has the additional benefit of suppressing some related autoimmune diseases, such as immunohemolytic anemia or immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. In resistant cases, single-agent treatments with nucleoside drugs such as fludarabine, pentostatin, or cladribine may be successful. Younger and healthier patients may choose allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation in <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> permanent cure.|$|E
50|$|Some {{terminally ill}} {{patients}} stop all debilitating treatments to reduce unwanted side effects.

By then Jacob had become over 100 years old. Benjamin is treated {{as a young child}} in most of the Biblical narrative, but at one point is abruptly described as the father of ten sons. Textual scholars believe that this {{is the result of the}} genealogical passage, in which his children are named, being from a much later source than the Jahwist and Elohist narratives, which make up most of the Joseph narrative, and which consistently describe Benjamin as a child.|$|E
25|$|The {{summer before}} the 2014–15 season saw further arrivals of Jamie Mackie on loan, Oliver Norwood {{and the return}} of Simon Cox. The club was under a high threat of administration, causing departures of Sean Morrison and Adam le Fondre and a Thai {{consortium}} taking over the club. A good start to Nigel Adkins' second season in charge was followed by a poor run of results that ended with his sacking after the 6–1 away defeat to Birmingham City with Steve Clarke taking over the next day in <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> promotion push. However, a lack of goals and some poor form in the league meant the club faced some fears of relegation to League One, but luckily safety was secured with few games to spare. Nonetheless during that time, the club embarked on a successful FA Cup journey, reaching the semi-final where they were unlucky to lose to 2–1 to Arsenal at Wembley.|$|E
25|$|In late 1977, Gacy {{began dating}} Carole Hoff in <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reconciliation. By {{the end of}} 1977, Gacy is also known to have murdered an {{additional}} six young men {{between the ages of}} 16 and 21. The first of these six victims, 18-year-old Robert Gilroy, was last seen alive on September 15. Gilroy—the son of a Chicago police sergeant—was suffocated and buried in the crawl space. On September 12, Gacy had flown to Pittsburgh to supervise a remodeling project and did not return to Chicago until September 16. As Gacy is known to have been in another state at the time the youth was last seen, it is possible that Gacy's subsequent claims that he had not acted alone in some murders may have held credence. Ten days after Gilroy was last seen, a 19-year-old U.S. Marine named John Mowery disappeared after leaving his mother's house to walk to his own apartment. Mowery was strangled to death and buried in the northwest corner of the crawl space perpendicular to the body of William Bundy.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of Hattin in 1187 saw the Crusaders {{suffer a}} {{crushing}} defeat {{at the hands}} of Saladin. In the aftermath, many castles and cities fell to Saladin's forces so that only a handful of cities remained under the Crusaders' control. Beaufort {{was one of the last}} castles to resist Saladin. In April 1189, Saladin was preparing to besiege the castle and Arab sources describe the event in detail. At the time Beaufort was under the control of Reynald of Sidon who had survived the Battle of Hattin, While Saladin was camped at nearby Marjayoun, preparing for the siege, Reynald met him and claimed to have Muslim sympathies. He said that while he would like to hand over control of Beaufort, his family were in the Christian city of Tyre and he could not surrender until they were safely out of the city. In <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> taking the castle without any bloodshed, Reynald was given three months to extract his family from Tyre; instead he used this time to repair the castle and stock up on supplies.|$|E
25|$|The British {{defenders}} suffered little interference {{during the}} evacuation, perhaps because on 15 August, the Duke of Aosta had ordered Nasi {{to allow the}} British to evacuate without too much fighting, in <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> peace agreement being mediated through the Vatican. On 19 August, the Italians took control of Berbera and then moved down the coast to complete their conquest of British Somaliland and the colony was annexed by Mussolini to the Italian Empire {{as a part of}} Italian East Africa. The British air contingent tried to ease the evacuation; Blenheims from 11 Squadron left Aden at 5:35 p.m. on 18 August and carried out a high-level bombing attack on Italian vehicles near Laferug but lost a bomber to CR.42s from 410a Squadriglia, one crewman surviving. While the Italian fighter unit was distracted, Wellesley bombers from 223 Squadron took off from Perim Island to attack the airfield at Addis Ababa and destroyed the Duke of Aosta's personal aircraft. One SM.79, one Savoia-Marchetti SM.75 and three Ca.133 aircraft were destroyed according to Italian records and a SM.79 and SM.81 were badly damaged.|$|E

Moreover, as an Austrian citizen and of Jewish origin, {{he had no}} prospect of a permanent position. Early in 1912 Ehrenfest {{set out on a}} tour of German-speaking universities in <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> position. He visited Berlin where he saw Max Planck, Leipzig where he saw his old friend Herglotz, Munich where he met Arnold Sommerfeld, then Zürich and Vienna. While in Prague he met Albert Einstein for the first time, and they remained close friends thereafter. Einstein recommended Ehrenfest to succeed him in his position in Prague, but that did not work out. This was {{due to the fact that}} Ehrenfest declared himself to be an atheist. Sommerfeld offered him a position in Munich, but Ehrenfest received a better offer; at the same time there was an unexpected turn of events. H. A.
