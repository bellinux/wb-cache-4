2500|$|Inayat Khan {{had been}} staying in at a country house in Buckinghamshire, {{a place where}} agents had a final chance to adjust to their new identities and {{consider}} their missions before departure. Inayat Khan's conducting officer, a female companion who watched over agents in training, told Vera that Inayat Khan had descended into a gloom and was clearly troubled by the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{she was about to}} undertake. Then two fellow agents staying with Inayat Khan at the country house had written directly to Vera to say they felt she should not go. Such an intervention at this stage was most unusual.|$|E
2500|$|... "I want to {{just give}} you a {{personal}} anecdote about terrorism, because less than 20 years ago, I {{was the target of}} a terrorist group. It was the New World Liberation Front. They blew up power stations and put a bomb at my home when my husband was dying of cancer. And the bomb was set to detonate at two o'clock in the morning, but it was a construction explosive that doesn't detonate when it drops below freezing. [...] It doesn't usually freeze in San Francisco, but on this night, it dropped below freezing, and the bomb didn't detonate. I was very lucky. But, I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> might have happened. Later the same group shot out all the windows of my home.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard was {{interested}} in [...] "how" [...] one comes to acquire knowledge. Adolph Peter Adlers experience may have influenced him. He identified his audience as the [...] "reader" [...] and the [...] "listener" [...] but now he speaks of the [...] "seeker". He says, [...] "no man can see God without purity and that no man can know God without becoming a sinner. Dostoevsky tried to reproduce this concept in his art. In Stages on Life's Way, published the next day, he used David and Solomon as examples of those prototypes who did become pure in God's sight by becoming sinners. [...] "While David lay upon the ground with crushed and contrite heart, Solomon arose from his couch, but his understanding was crushed. Horror seized him when he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{it was to be}} God’s elect. He surmised that holy intimacy with God, the sincerity of the pure man before the Lord, was not the explanation, but that a private guilt was the secret which explained everything." ...|$|E

60|$|John Gayther {{looked upon}} her with pride. He {{knew that in}} her fair young mind that which ought to be rose high above <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was likely to be, which came into the more {{experienced}} mind of her mother.|$|R
60|$|It was a pitiable {{sight to}} see the poor {{homeless}} people sitting about, looking at the ruins of their houses. Some cried piteously; others gazed with listless faces, but with a cold despair even more painful to see. Fortunately, they had saved all their animals but, at present, they were too much absorbed in the <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they had lost, to bestow even a <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> satisfaction on <b>what</b> they had saved.|$|R
2500|$|Davey Wreden, 22 {{years old}} at the time of the modification's release, was {{inspired}} to create The Stanley Parable about three years prior, after considering the typical storytelling narratives within video games, and <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would happen if the player would go against that narration; Wreden also saw this as a means towards his planned career as a game developer. As a video game player, Wreden has found that most major triple-A titles at the time make numerous assumptions about the player's experience and fitting that within the game, and don't provide answers for [...] "what if" [...] questions that the player may consider. Wreden considered that more recent games with more engaging or thought-provoking stories, including the Metal Gear Solid series, Half-Life 2, Portal, Braid, and BioShock, started to approach this void, giving reason for the player to stop and think about the narration instead of simply going through the motions. Though his initial intent was a personal project simply to try to make such a game that asked the questions about why people play video games, he found that there were other gamers that had been considering the same type of questions. He then set out to make a game that would be the subject of discussion for players after they completed it. According to Wreden, his design document for the game was [...] "Mess with the player's head in every way possible, throwing them off-guard, or pretending there's an answer and then kinda whisking it away from in front of them." ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{a pretty}} snake, with bands of red, white, and black upon his body. Charley grew very pale at the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the narrow escape he had had, and wrung his brother very hard by the hand; while Hubert was half {{inclined}} to cry at the <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> might have happened.|$|R
60|$|I {{have now}} {{to show you}} <b>what</b> sort <b>of</b> a man the Nabob was, who was thus set up in {{defiance}} of the Company's authority; what Mr. Hastings himself <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him; <b>what</b> the judges <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him; and <b>what</b> all the world <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him.|$|R
60|$|But {{she cared}} {{little about the}} inclemency of the weather. She knew her way about well enough and her mind was too full <b>of</b> terrible <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was real, to yield to the subtle and feeble fears engendered by imaginings of the supernatural.|$|R

6000|$|... "It all scares me," [...] replied Slone. He {{did feel}} panicky, {{and that was}} from <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> shame might befall Lucy.

50|$|Loss of a {{child by}} {{adoption}} is often disenfranchised because the decision to give a child up for adoption is voluntary, and therefore it is not acceptable by society to grieve.

Many birth mothers experience regret and have <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> might have been or of reuniting with the child.|$|R

5000|$|Joe Leydon of Variety {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review writing: [...] "A solidly-made and conventionally-satisfying Western, {{is one of}} those movies.
