40|$|The {{effect of}} {{electron}} correlation on <b>the</b> angle <b>dependence</b> of magnetoconductivity is studied in quasi-one-dimensional organic conductors.

We found that <b>the</b> momentum <b>dependence</b> of quasi-particle's lifetime mainly governs <b>the</b> angle <b>dependence</b> of one-dimensional axis magnetoconductivity. On the other hand, the change in velocity originating from the electron correlation gives the dominant effects on <b>the</b> angle <b>dependence</b> of <b>the</b> interchain axis magnetoconductivity.

40|$|The current-field and the conductivity-field {{characteristics}} of random hopping non-uniform {{systems in the}} limit of a weak electron-phonon coupling (band-like hopping transport in disordered solids) have been calculated numerically within the Bottger-Bryksin model. In particular, we consider thin layers placed between two planar Ohmic contacts, with exponential spatial variations in the total centre concentration over the layer thickness. We find that firstly for r-hopping transport in spatially uniform layers the current decreases with increasing field, reaching a constant saturation value, and on increasing the degree of non-uniformity the saturation current becomes lower and secondly both uniform and non-uniform r- epsilon -hopping systems are almost exactly Ohmic in the investigated field range; conductivity decreases on increasing the degree of non-uniformity of the centre distribution. Degree of the layer non-uniformity {{in the limit of}} weak electron-phonon coupling are quite different from <b>the</b> <b>dependences</b> in <b>the</b> case of strong electron-phonon coupling. <b>The</b> <b>dependences</b> on <b>the</b> degree of the layer non-uniformity of the centre distribution. <b>The</b> <b>dependences</b> on <b>the</b> degree of the layer non-uniformity in the limit of weak electron-phonon coupling are quite different from <b>the</b> <b>dependences</b> in <b>the</b> case of strong electron-phonon coupling...|$|R

The reliability of the applied technique of nuclear magnetic resonance on oriented nuclei was demonstrated by measurements at different radio-frequency (rf) field strengths. The interpretation of the relaxation curves, which used transition rates to describe the excitation of the nuclear spins by a frequency-modulated rf field, was confirmed by model calculations. <b>The</b> magnetic-field <b>dependence</b> of <b>the</b> so-called enhancement factor for rf fields, which {{is closely related to}} <b>the</b> magnetic-field <b>dependence</b> of <b>the</b> {{spin-lattice relaxation}}, was also measured.
