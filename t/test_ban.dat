5|$|Members of the Soviet military–industrial complex also opposed a <b>test</b> <b>ban,</b> {{though some}} scientists, {{including}} Igor Kurchatov, were supportive of antinuclear efforts. France, {{which was in}} the midst of developing its own nuclear weapon, also firmly opposed a <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> in the late 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The AEC would {{eventually}} concede, as well, that even {{low levels of}} radiation were harmful. It {{was a combination of}} rising public support for a <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> and the shock of the 1957 Soviet Sputnik launch that encouraged Eisenhower to take steps towards a <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> in 1958.|$|E
5|$|The Partial <b>Test</b> <b>Ban</b> Treaty (PTBT) is the {{abbreviated}} {{name of the}} 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water, which prohibited all test detonations of nuclear weapons except for those conducted underground. It is also abbreviated as the Limited <b>Test</b> <b>Ban</b> Treaty (LTBT) and Nuclear <b>Test</b> <b>Ban</b> Treaty (NTBT), though the latter may also refer to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which succeeded the PTBT for ratifying parties.|$|E
50|$|With NASCAR's 2009 <b>testing</b> <b>ban</b> in effect, Rockingham's half-mile is {{expected}} to pick up testing, especially in {{the week before the}} Sprint Cup returns to Martinsville.|$|R
50|$|While NASCAR's <b>testing</b> <b>ban</b> {{is set to}} {{continue}} for the 2010 season, Goodyear held a tire test November 2, 2009, to consider tires, and allowed all teams to test.|$|R
50|$|However the USSR did not {{immediately}} follow the U.S. lead in 1958 in establishing a program. Presumably, their position {{in support of a}} comprehensive nuclear <b>testing</b> <b>ban</b> stalled any efforts to establish such a program until the mid-1960s.|$|R
5|$|In August 1957, the US assented to {{a two-year}} testing {{moratorium}} {{proposed by the}} Soviet Union, but required that it be linked to restrictions on the production of fissionable material with military uses, a condition that the Soviet Union rejected. While Eisenhower insisted on linking a <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> to a broader disarmament effort (e.g., the production cut-off), Moscow insisted on independent consideration of a <b>test</b> <b>ban.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{pleased by}} the findings, the Eisenhower {{administration}} proposed negotiations on a permanent <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> and announced it would self-impose a year-long testing moratorium if Britain and the Soviet Union did the same. This decision amounted to a victory for John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles (then the Director of Central Intelligence), and PSAC, who had argued within the Eisenhower administration for separating a <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> from larger disarmament efforts, and a defeat for the Department of Defense and AEC, which had argued to the contrary.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November 1957, after Sputnik {{and under}} {{pressure}} to bring on a dedicated science advisor, Eisenhower created the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC), which {{had the effect of}} eroding the AEC's monopoly over scientific advice. In stark contrast to the AEC, PSAC promoted a <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> and argued against Strauss's claims concerning its strategic implications and technical feasibility. In late 1957, the Soviet Union made a second offer of a three-year moratorium without inspections, but lacking any consensus within his administration, Eisenhower rejected it. In early 1958, the discord within American circles, particularly among scientists, was made clear in hearings before the Senate Subcommittee on Nuclear Disarmament, chaired by Senator Hubert Humphrey. The hearings featured conflicting testimony from the likes of Teller and Linus Pauling, as well as from Harold Stassen, who argued that a <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> could safely be separated from broader disarmament, and AEC members, who argued that a cutoff in nuclear production should precede a <b>test</b> <b>ban.</b>|$|E
50|$|In July 2016, it was {{revealed}} that Hadebe received a four-year ban from the sport after failing a drugs <b>test,</b> <b>banning</b> him from playing rugby at any level until May 2020. He tested positively for two forbidden forms of steroids.|$|R
50|$|On 20 June 2004, {{with a new}} {{government}} in place in India, both countries agreed to extend a nuclear <b>testing</b> <b>ban</b> and {{to set up a}} hotline between their foreign secretaries aimed at preventing misunderstandings that might lead to a nuclear war.|$|R
50|$|On 20 June 2004, both India and Pakistan {{agreed to}} extend a nuclear <b>testing</b> <b>ban</b> and {{to set up an}} Islamabad-New Delhi hotline between their foreign {{secretaries}} aimed at preventing misunderstandings that might lead to nuclear war. The hotline was set up with the assistance of United States military officers.|$|R
5|$|The British {{governments of}} 1954–58 (under Conservatives Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Harold Macmillan) also quietly {{resisted}} a <b>test</b> <b>ban,</b> despite the British public favoring a deal, until the US Congress approved expanded nuclear collaboration in 1958 and until after Britain had tested its first hydrogen bombs. In their view, testing was necessary if the UK nuclear program were {{to continue to}} develop. This opposition was tempered by concern that resistance to a <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> might lead the US and Soviet Union to pursue an agreement without Britain having any say in the matter.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower {{would leave}} office with an {{agreement}} out of reach, as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he relied heavily, became {{mired in the}} complex technical questions of a <b>test</b> <b>ban,</b> driven {{in part by a}} strong interest among American experts to lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology. Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns about the ability of inspections and monitors to successfully detect tests. The primary product of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism. Ultimately, the goal of a comprehensive <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> would be abandoned in favor of a partial ban due to questions over seismic detection of underground tests.|$|E
5|$|He was Director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, {{which he}} helped to found with Ernest O. Lawrence, from 1958 to 1960, and after that he {{continued}} as an Associate Director. He chaired the committee that founded the Space Sciences Laboratory at Berkeley. He also served concurrently as a Professor of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley. He was a tireless advocate of a strong nuclear program and argued for continued testing and development—in fact, he {{stepped down from the}} directorship of Livermore so that he could better lobby against the proposed <b>test</b> <b>ban.</b> He testified against the <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> both before Congress as well as on television.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, a {{power failure}} and crash of a Velocity {{undergoing}} initial testing at North Las Vegas Airport brought national attention to homebuilt aircraft <b>testing.</b> <b>Banning</b> of particular aircraft and flight {{operations at the}} airport afterward resulted in a power struggle over who has authority over airspace and access to public use airports.|$|R
50|$|For the 2009 season, NASCAR {{imposed a}} blanket <b>ban</b> on <b>testing</b> at any track used {{by any of}} NASCAR's three {{national}} series or its Camping World touring events. Rockingham, unlike many tracks used in testing historically, is not {{on any of the}} series in question, and teams will use both tracks to run around NASCAR's <b>testing</b> <b>ban.</b>|$|R

5|$|In early 1959, a {{roadblock}} {{to an agreement}} was removed as Macmillan and Eisenhower, over opposition from the Department of Defense, agreed to consider a <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> separately from broader disarmament endeavors.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{initially}} {{focused on}} a comprehensive ban, but this was abandoned due to technical questions surrounding the detection of underground tests and Soviet concerns over the intrusiveness of proposed verification methods. The impetus for the <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> was provided by rising public anxiety over the magnitude of nuclear tests, particularly tests of new thermonuclear weapons (hydrogen bombs), and the resulting nuclear fallout. A <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> was also seen {{as a means of}} slowing nuclear proliferation and the nuclear arms race. Though the PTBT did not halt proliferation or the arms race, its enactment did coincide with a substantial decline in the concentration of radioactive particles in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|On 19 September 1957, the US {{conducted}} the first contained underground test at the Nevada Test Site, codenamed Rainier. The Rainier shot complicated {{the push for}} a comprehensive <b>test</b> <b>ban,</b> as underground tests could not be as easily identified as atmospheric tests.|$|E
50|$|As part of {{the festivities}} before the 2013 Nürburgring 24 Hour race, Michael Schumacher and other Mercedes-Benz drivers {{took part in a}} promotional event which saw Schumacher {{complete}} a demonstration lap of the Nordschleife at the wheel of a 2011 Mercedes W02. As with Heidfelds lap, and also partly due to F1s strict in-season <b>testing</b> <b>bans,</b> the lap left many motorsport fans underwhelmed.|$|R
5|$|Official bodies {{such as the}} European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Test Methods of the European Commission, the Interagency Coordinating Committee for the Validation of Alternative Methods in the US, ZEBET in Germany, and the Japanese Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods (among others) also {{promote and}} {{disseminate}} the 3Rs. These bodies are mainly driven by responding to regulatory requirements, such as supporting the cosmetics <b>testing</b> <b>ban</b> in the EU by validating alternative methods.|$|R
5000|$|Biffle {{qualified}} for the Chase {{for the second year}} in a row in 2009 but, for the first time since 2002 (when he ran a limited schedule), failed to record a win.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Geneva Conference {{began in the}} fall of 1958, Eisenhower faced renewed {{domestic}} opposition to a comprehensive <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> as Senator Albert Gore Sr. argued in a widely circulated letter that a partial ban would preferable due to Soviet opposition to strong verification measures.|$|E
5|$|Shoup later {{warned against}} an armed {{response}} during the Cuban Missile Crisis, noting {{how difficult it}} would be to invade the country. Still, he prepared a team of Marines to invade Cuba should it be necessary. He and the other Joint Chiefs unanimously recommended a quick airstrike to knock out the missiles once they were discovered there. Kennedy subsequently sought Shoup's advice in evaluating the implications of the Partial Nuclear <b>Test</b> <b>Ban</b> Treaty. While his position in the Joint Chiefs of Staff was intended to be limited, he had gained Kennedy's confidence and was often called on for private consultations. Shoup supported the <b>test</b> <b>ban,</b> seeing it as a deterrent to nuclear war.|$|E
5|$|An {{article in}} Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists {{describes}} how a North Korean underground nuclear test on 25 May 2009 was detected {{and the source}} located by GPS satellites. The authors suggest that the effectiveness of GPS satellites for detecting nuclear explosions enhances the ability to verify compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear <b>Test</b> <b>Ban</b> Treaty, giving the United States more reason to ratify it.|$|E
50|$|The Cosmetics Directive {{provides}} {{the regulatory framework}} for the phasing out of animal testing for cosmetics purposes. It establishes prohibitions against (a) testing finished cosmetic products and cosmetic ingredients on animals (<b>testing</b> <b>ban),</b> and (b) marketing in the EU finished cosmetic products and ingredients included in cosmetic products which were tested on animals for cosmetics purposes (marketing ban). The same provisions are contained in Cosmetics Regulation EU 1223/2009, which replaces the Cosmetics Directive as of July 11, 2013.|$|R

5|$|In 1956, Christy {{was one of}} {{a number}} of {{scientists}} from Caltech who publicly called for a ban on atmospheric nuclear testing. The 1963 Partial Nuclear <b>Test</b> <b>Ban</b> Treaty that Christy advocated put an end to one of his most unusual projects. He worked with Freeman Dyson on Project Orion, the design of a spacecraft propelled by atomic bombs.|$|E
5|$|In {{nuclear energy}} studies, xenon {{is used in}} bubble chambers, probes, and in other areas where a high {{molecular}} weight and inert chemistry is desirable. A by-product of nuclear weapon testing is the release of radioactive xenon-133 and xenon-135. These isotopes are monitored to ensure compliance with nuclear <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> treaties, and to confirm nuclear tests by states such as North Korea.|$|E
5|$|The {{negotiations}} were inaugurated on 15 July 1963 at the Kremlin with Khrushchev in attendance. Khrushchev reiterated that the Anglo-American inspection plan {{would amount to}} espionage, effectively dismissing {{the possibility of a}} comprehensive ban. Following the script of his 3 July 1963 speech, Khrushchev did not demand a simultaneous moratorium on underground testing and instead proposed a non-aggression pact. Under instruction from Washington, Harriman replied that the US would explore the possibility of a non-aggression pact in good faith, but indicated that while a <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> could be quickly completed, a non-aggression pact would require lengthy discussions. Additionally, such a pact would complicate the issue of Western access to West Berlin. Harriman also took the opportunity to propose a non-proliferation agreement with would bar the transfer of nuclear weapons between countries. Khrushchev said that such an agreement should be considered in the future, but in the interim, a <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> would have the same effect on limiting proliferation.|$|E
50|$|In 1968, a {{modified}} Strypi {{was used in}} Material Test Vehicle (MTV) booster tests. Although atmospheric nuclear <b>testing</b> was now <b>banned,</b> {{as a part of}} the Test Readiness Program the U.S. Air Force continued to develop the means of <b>testing,</b> should the <b>ban</b> be lifted.|$|R
50|$|While the {{formulas}} {{above are}} likely useful for back-of-the-envelope discussions, {{it needs to}} be considered that little actual testing of these effects was carried out due to various <b>test</b> <b>bans.</b> Over the history of US testing, only seven tests with the appropriate instrumentation took place in the upper atmosphere altitudes of 10 to(-) 25 km that would be appropriate for late-stage blackout, and only two were tested at exoatmospheric altitudes. None of these tests contained multiple bursts, which would be expected from any attack deliberately creating blackout.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{repaving}} project, {{the track}} has seen {{quite a few}} NASCAR Sprint Cup, Nationwide and Camping World Truck Series teams use it for testing. Teams test for places such as Martinsville, Richmond and even Phoenix. The recent <b>testing</b> <b>ban</b> instituted by NASCAR has increased the draw of teams that test at the high-banked half-mile. Names that have tested there include Newman, Stewart, Martin, Kyle Busch, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Kasey Kahne, Joey Logano, Greg Biffle, Clint Bowyer, Bobby Labonte, Denny Hamlin, Kurt Busch, Juan Pablo Montoya, David Ragan, Danica Patrick and more.|$|R
