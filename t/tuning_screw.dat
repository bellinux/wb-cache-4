2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{components}} that make up a drum's anatomy. Some of these anatomical components vary dependent upon the type of drum, the manufacturer, and the year in which it was made. However, nearly all modern drums have the same essential components. Kick drums often have legs called [...] "spurs" [...] {{on either side of the}} drum shell. These spurs are used to prevent the kick drum from rolling side to side, to prevent the drum from sliding forward as it is being played and to provide overall added stability to the drum. Casings, also known as lugs, vary in shape and size. They all serve the same purpose as the receiving end of the drum tension rod (also known as a <b>tuning</b> <b>screw)</b> and provide the anchor point for the tension rods themselves. Casings are found on nearly all modern drums. The number of casings a drum has can vary from drum to drum and manufacturer to manufacturer. A drum can have as little as six casings and as many as twelve. Tension rods, also known as tuning screws, are threaded bolts that are placed around the rim of a drum and screw into the casings. They enable the musician tp adjust the tension of the drum's head and effect it's overall pitch, tone, and timbre. They come in many lengths and should also always have a tension rod washer that is often made of metal or hard plastic.|$|E

40|$|Microwave {{communication}} devices have become ubiquitous {{in the past}} decade. As {{an increasing number of}} systems compete for spectrum, guard bands have shrunk to increase bandwidth efficiency. The frequency behaviour of microwave devices is affected by thermal expansion. In order to avoid interference with adjacent bands, microwave components must exhibit high temperature-stability in most communications applications. Thermally stable materials can be used to construct temperature-stable components. However, this approach requires an expensive mass and cost trade-off. Temperature compensated aluminum resonators and filters provide major advantages in cost and mass. This work proposes that a compensating <b>tuning</b> <b>screw</b> with a temperature-dependent effective length be constructed by mounting a bimetallic compensator {{at the end of a}} mounting screw. This so-called bimetal tuning-screw can be used to produce temperature-compensated resonators and filters. There are several advantages to this approach. Compensation can be tuned by adjusting the depth of the bimetal, simply by adjusting the mounting screw. Since there are no moving parts inside the cavity or filter, and the bimetal can be plated, there are no additional sources of passive intermodulation. Also, this design is simple to implement for waveguide designs in general. In order to compensate for temperature drift, it is useful to quantify uncompensated drift. Temperature drift for a lossless linearly expanding RF component is derived from Maxwell's equations. For the lossy case, it is demonstrated that the resulting formula is approximately true, and that the quality of this approximation is excellent for practical levels of temperature range and thermal expansion. Experimental results are provided that demonstrate bimetal compensation under uniform-temperature conditions for a single aluminum resonator. Measured drift of the compensated resonator is - 0. 38 ppm/°C, compared to - 23 ppm/°C for an uncompensated resonator. Measured drift for a bimetal-compensated 4 -pole filter prototype is 2. 35 ppm/°C. A method for adjusting compensation for a filter is also provided. Multiphysics simulations are used to examine power handling for bimetal-compensated filters. It is demonstrated that power-handling can be improved by reducing the effective length of the compensator to improve heat conduction to the cavity or filter...|$|E

40|$|Post-fabrication tuning of filters {{is usually}} {{realized}} by adding number of elements for tuning the frequency and/or controlling the couplings between the resonators. The task of these tuning elements is to control resonators center frequency, inter-resonators coupling and input/output couplings. While {{the most common}} tool for the post-fabrication tuning is to use <b>tuning</b> <b>screws</b> and rods, it is not usually practical to tune a planar filter with these tools. This thesis introduces a novel method for global post-fabrication tuning of microwave filters by designing and adding a passive distributed-element circuit in parallel to the detuned filter. The idea, which is demonstrated by experimental results, has several advantages over traditional techniques for filter <b>tuning</b> that use <b>screws.</b> The quality factor of resonator reduces significantly after adding the <b>tuning</b> <b>screws</b> while the proposed method {{does not affect the}} Q of resonators. The most important advantage of the proposed compensator circuit is that it can be employed without knowing details of the detuned filters. Since the compensator circuit will be added in parallel to the detuned filter, it will not affect the elements of filter individually. So whether the filter is planar or cavity, the proposed circuit can be used for the tuning. The experimental results obtained demonstrate the validity of this method. The dissertation also presents a novel concept for designing a center frequency and bandwidth tunable microstrip filter by using GaAs varactors. The proposed isolated coupling structure which is used in this filter makes the bandwidth tuning possible by reducing the loading effect of coupling elements on the resonators. The center frequency of this filter can be also tuned by using a different set of varactors connected to resonators. A 3 -pole filter based on this concept has been designed and simulated. The concept can be expanded to higher order filters...|$|R

Wooden fingerboard makers are now offering custom designs; the buyer can choose from their line of graphics or send in their own. The wooden boards come in a variety of widths from 26 - 32 mm and concave can vary greatly from maker to maker. Some companies offer even more customization options such as the choosing of the plies used to go into the deck, as well as the width/length of the deck. Along with wooden decks, advanced fingerboarder's also tend to prefer bearing wheels to plastic. Bearing wheels can be made from a range of materials such as teflon, urethane, silicon, fiberglass, and even clay. The wheels are usually put into a lathe to ensure the best shape. Once the wheels have been readied, bearings are put into place to increase the smoothness of the wheels rolling on the axle. <b>Tuning</b> <b>screws</b> for the wheels cause the wheels to roll more smoothly.

These devices find wide application in communication systems, such as satellite links or wireless base stations. In particular, {{the work has}} been focused {{in the design of}} circular-waveguide dualmode (CWDM) filters. The synthesis technique makes use of distributed models, which are a halfway point between the fast but imprecise lumped circuit models, and the more accurate but costly full-wave electromagnetic models. An automatic software tool to design this type of filters has also been developed, which is able to obtain the physical dimensions of the filter in a matter of minutes. A new technique to correct manufacturing deviations in CWDM filters is proposed next, which avoids the use of <b>tuning</b> <b>screws.</b> Instead, fixed squared insertions are employed, which can be fabricated in separated pieces. An space mapping technique is used to calculate the dimensions of these pieces and, after few iterations, the procedure is able to achieve the required response. A systematic method to design manifold-coupled multiplexers is also presented, which also employs distributed models. First, the design of classic multiplexers with CWDM filters is considered. The whole design procedure is thoroughly explained, starting from the required specifications and finishing with the physical dimensions.
