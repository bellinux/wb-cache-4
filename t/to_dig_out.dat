5|$|The Board of Supervisors met in {{a special}} session {{at the end of}} June 1939 and Middleton was {{directed}} to take over the business management of the university. The school's finances were in a state of chaos, and it would take effort and time <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>out</b> of the mess. The dean of the Law School, Paul M. Hebert, became the acting president, and Middleton became acting vice president and comptroller. Middleton chose two accounting professors, Dr. Daniel Borth and Dr. Mack Hornbeak, to work with him, and a New York firm was hired to come in and establish sound business procedures.|$|E
5|$|Bears are {{generally}} bulky and robust animals with short tails. They are sexually dimorphic {{with regard to}} size, with males typically being larger. Larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species. Relying as they do on strength rather than speed, bears have relatively short limbs with thick bones to support their bulk. The shoulder blades and the pelvis are correspondingly massive. The limbs are much straighter {{than those of the}} big cats as {{there is no need for}} them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their gait. The strong forelimbs are used to catch prey, to excavate dens, <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>out</b> burrowing animals, to turn over rocks and logs to locate prey, and to club large creatures.|$|E
5|$|The site {{chosen for}} the dock to be built on was an area of land bordered by Salthouse Dock to the east, the {{entrance}} channel to Canning Dock {{to the north and}} by Duke's Dock to the south. The land earmarked for the site had to be cleared, with 59 tenants being evicted and numerous premises demolished including a pub, several houses and the Dock Trustee's Dockyard. Upon the clearance of this land both the Salthouse and Canning dock's were drained to allow entrance passages into the Albert Dock to be constructed, whilst hundreds of 'Navvies' were employed <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>out</b> the dock basin and construct the new river wall. The dock basin was completed by February 1845, allowing the first ships to enter the Albert Dock, although with the warehouses still under construction this was merely to allow these boats to 'lay-up'.|$|E

25|$|The Foundation Pit (Russian: Котлован, kotlovan) is {{a gloomy}} {{symbolic}} and semi-satirical novel by Andrei Platonov.

The workers dig each day but slowly cease to understand the meaning of their work. The enormous foundation pit sucks out all of their physical and mental energy.|$|E

The dam builders' proposal is to use explosives <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>out</b> the tons of rock. This will create strong sound waves that could possibly kill the Irrawaddy dolphins due to their highly sensitive hearing structures.|$|E

25|$|Trogons are cavity nesters. Nests are {{dug into}} rotting wood or termite nests, with one species, the violaceous trogon, nesting in wasp nests. Nest {{cavities}} {{can either be}} deep upward slanting tubes that lead to fully enclosed chambers, or much shallower open niches (from which the bird is visible). Nests are dug with the beak, incidentally giving the family its name. Nest digging may be undertaken by the male alone or by both sexes. In the case of nests dug into tree trunks, the wood must be strong enough not to collapse but soft enough <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>out.</b> Trogons have been observed landing on dead tree trunks and slapping the wood with their tails, presumably to test the firmness.|$|E
25|$|With {{the passage}} of time, the temples fell into disuse and {{eventually}} became covered by sand. By the 6th century BC, the sand already covered the statues of the main temple up to their knees. The temple was forgotten until 1813, when Swiss orientalist Jean-Louis Burckhardt found the top frieze of the main temple. Burckhardt talked about his discovery with Italian explorer Giovanni Belzoni, who travelled to the site, but was unable <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>out</b> an entry to the temple. Belzoni returned in 1817, this time succeeding {{in his attempt to}} enter the complex. A detailed early description of the temples, together with contemporaneous line drawings, can be found in Edward William Lane's Description of Egypt (1825–1828).|$|E
25|$|An {{admirer of}} the {{freshness}} and clarity of Bertrand Russell’s History of Western Philosophy, whose foreword he composed, {{as well as}} a critic of some of its shortcomings, Mosterín has undertaken the ambitious plan of writing all by himself a universal history of thought, not only Western, but also Asian and even Archaic. His series of books on Historia del Pensamiento aims at covering all main intellectual traditions from an interdisciplinary approach dealing simultaneously with developments in philosophy, science and ideology. The analysis of the ideas is critical and uncompromising, combining rigor with clarity and straightforward language. Besides, he delves into the arguments and does not hesitate <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>out</b> their eventual flaws.|$|E

Eventually, the railroad company suspends all efforts <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>out</b> the train, stranding the town. For weeks, the Ingalls subsist on potatoes and coarse brown bread, using twisted hay for fuel. As even this meager food runs out, Laura's future husband Almanzo Wilder and his friend Cap Garland risk their lives to bring wheat to the starving townspeople – enough to last the rest of the winter.|$|E

Pathan, Ashish Nehra and Anil Kumble continued <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>out</b> wickets, but Morton remained at the crease. The West Indies crashing to 112/6 after 24 overs. Kumble did get Banks and Dwayne Smith out lbw, the latter for a 12-ball cameo that yielded 26 runs. However, Morton stuck in, making 84, before losing his wicket to Nehra, getting caught by Dravid. West Indies needed 68 runs from 11 overs, with three wickets in hand. Denesh Ramdin, the wicket-keeper, gave it a go.
