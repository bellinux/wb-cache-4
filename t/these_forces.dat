5|$|John Rutledge, {{recently}} {{elected president}} of the General Assembly that remained as the backbone of South Carolina's revolutionary government, organized a defense force under the command of 46-year-old Colonel William Moultrie, a former militiaman and Indian fighter. <b>These</b> <b>forces</b> comprised three infantry regiments, two rifle regiments, and a small artillery regiment; they were augmented by three independent artillery companies, and the total force numbered about 2,000. <b>These</b> <b>forces</b> were further augmented by the arrival of Continental regiments from North Carolina and Virginia (1,900 troops), as well as militia numbering 2,700 from Charleston and the surrounding backcountry.|$|E
5|$|Although other British {{forces were}} {{deployed}} during the year, most were engaged on other operations incidental {{to the main}} Atlantic campaign, such as the expeditionary force to the Cape of Good Hope under Commodore Home Riggs Popham. In addition, a number of blockade squadrons were deployed to the major ports of the French Atlantic coast. <b>These</b> <b>forces</b> contained the French warships still at anchor in the ports and restricted the return of French warships from service at sea during the campaign. <b>These</b> <b>forces</b> included a Channel squadron under Rear-Admiral Thomas Louis, whose ships intercepted and captured a frigate of Commodore Jean-Marthe-Adrien L'Hermite's squadron on 27 September, and blockade forces off Cadiz under the distant command of Vice-Admiral Lord Collingwood and Brest under Admiral William Cornwallis. Cornwallis in particular was particularly effective: under his watch, only one French ship of the line successfully entered or departed Brest harbour during the year.|$|E
5|$|Ibn Bajjah (Avempace, c. 1085–1138) {{proposed}} {{that for every}} force there is a reaction force. While he did not specify that <b>these</b> <b>forces</b> be equal, it was still {{an early version of}} Newton's third law of motion.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>these</b> <b>forces,</b> Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons {{and one of}} light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. By 1805, the Grande Armée had grown to a force of 350,000 men, who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.|$|E
5|$|A second expedition, {{under the}} praetor Publius Varinius, was then {{dispatched}} against Spartacus. For some reason, Varinius {{seems to have}} split his forces {{under the command of}} his subordinates Furius and Cossinius. Plutarch mentions that Furius commanded some 2,000 men, but neither the strength of the remaining forces, nor whether the expedition was composed of militia or legions, appears to be known. <b>These</b> <b>forces</b> were also defeated by the army of escaped slaves: Cossinius was killed, Varinius was nearly captured, and the equipment of the armies was seized by the slaves.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian deities are {{the gods}} and goddesses worshipped in ancient Egypt. The beliefs and rituals {{surrounding}} these gods formed the core of ancient Egyptian religion, which emerged sometime in prehistory. Deities represented natural forces and phenomena, and the Egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings and rituals so that <b>these</b> <b>forces</b> would continue to function according to maat, or divine order. After {{the founding of the}} Egyptian state around 3100BC, the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh, who claimed to be the gods' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out.|$|E

Odin will ride to the well Mímisbrunnr and will consult Mímir on behalf of himself and his people. Yggdrasil, the cosmological tree, will shiver and all beings will be fearful. The gods and the einherjar will don their war gear and advance to Vígríðr. Odin, wearing a golden helmet, a coat of mail, and brandishing his spear Gungnir, will ride in the front.|$|E
5|$|At {{the opening}} of 1987, {{the last year of}} the war, the Libyan expeditionary force was still impressive, {{comprising}} 8,000 soldiers, 300 tanks, many multiple rocket launchers (rocket artillery) and regular artillery pieces, Mi-24 helicopters and sixty combat aircraft. <b>These</b> <b>forces</b> did not have a unified command, but were divided into an Operational Group South, active in the Tibesti with 2,500 men, and an Operational Group East, centered in Faya-Largeau.|$|E

5|$|Bottom-dwelling in nature, {{the giant}} {{freshwater}} stingray inhabits sandy or muddy areas and preys on small fishes and invertebrates. Females give live birth to litters {{of one to}} four pups, which are sustained to term by maternally produced histotroph ("uterine milk"). This species faces heavy fishing pressure for meat, recreation, and aquarium display, as well as extensive habitat degradation and fragmentation. <b>These</b> <b>forces</b> have resulted in substantial population declines in at least central Thailand and Cambodia. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the giant freshwater stingray as Endangered.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1644, the Covenanters and Parliamentarians had been besieging York, which was defended by the Marquess of Newcastle. Rupert had {{gathered}} an army which marched through the northwest of England, gathering reinforcements and fresh recruits on the way, and across the Pennines to relieve the city. The convergence of <b>these</b> <b>forces</b> made the ensuing battle {{the largest of the}} civil wars.|$|E
5|$|Déby faces armed {{opposition}} from {{groups who are}} deeply divided by leadership clashes but united in their intention to overthrow him. <b>These</b> <b>forces</b> stormed the capital on 13 April 2006, but were ultimately repelled. Chad's greatest foreign influence is France, which maintains 1,000 soldiers in the country. Déby relies on the French to help repel the rebels, and France gives the Chadian army logistical and intelligence support for fear of a complete collapse of regional stability. Nevertheless, Franco-Chadian relations were soured by the granting of oil drilling rights to the American Exxon company in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{strategy}} planned by Manekshaw, the army launched several preparatory operations in East Pakistan including training and equipping the Mukti Bahini (a local group of Bengali nationalists). About three brigades of regular Bangladesh troops were trained. As an additional measure, 75,000 guerrillas were trained and equipped with arms and ammunition. <b>These</b> <b>forces</b> {{were used to}} sporadically harass the Pakistani Army stationed in East Pakistan in the lead up to the war.|$|E
5|$|For certain {{physical}} scenarios, it {{is impossible}} to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all <b>these</b> <b>forces</b> are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.|$|E
5|$|Fortune was a {{ceremonial}} magician. The magical principles on which her Fraternity was based were adopted {{from the late}} nineteenth century Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, with other influences coming from Theosophy and Christian Science. The magical ceremonies performed by Fortune's Fraternity were placed into two categories: initiations, in which the candidate was introduced to magical forces, and evocation, in which <b>these</b> <b>forces</b> were manipulated for a given purpose.|$|E

5|$|In early January 1915 the German naval command {{found out}} that British ships were {{conducting}} reconnaissance in the Dogger Bank area. Admiral Ingenohl was initially reluctant to attempt to destroy <b>these</b> <b>forces,</b> because the I Scouting Group was temporarily weakened while Von der Tann was in drydock for periodic maintenance. Konteradmiral (counter admiral) Richard Eckermann—the Chief of Staff of the High Seas Fleet—insisted on the operation, and so Ingenohl relented and ordered Hipper to take his battlecruisers to the Dogger Bank.|$|E

50|$|With {{the help}} of a kapo who hid him {{in the early days of}} April 1945, shortly before the camp's evacuation, Brazda was able to avoid being sent away with {{thousands}} of prisoners. <b>These</b> <b>forced</b> evacuation measures turned into death marches for nearly half of them, who were shot on the spot if they were too weak to sustain the pace.|$|R
50|$|Some recent advancements in {{explicit}} solvent modelling, are the {{new generation}} of polarizable force fields, which are currently being created. <b>These</b> <b>force</b> fields are able to account for changes in the molecular charge distribution. A number of <b>these</b> <b>force</b> fields are being developed to utilise multipole moments, as oppose to point charges, given that multipole moments can reflect the charge anisotropy of the molecules. One such method is the Atomic Multipole Optimised Energetics for Biomolecular Applications (AMOEBA) force field. This method has been used to study the solvation dynamics of ions. Other emerging polarisable forcefields which have been applied to condensed phase systems are; the Sum of Interactions between Fragments ab initio computed (SIBFA) and the Quantum Chemical Topology Force Field (QCTFF). Polarisable water models are also being produced. The so-called charge on spring (COS) model gives water models with the ability to polarize due to one of the interaction sites being flexible (on spring).|$|R
