However, folksonomies lack structure and their use for searching and browsing is limited. Current approaches for acquiring latent hierarchical structures from folksonomies have had limited success.

We measure the usability cost, and in particular cognitive effort required to create <b>tag</b> <b>pairs</b> rather than individual tags. Our results show that when applied to <b>tag</b> <b>pairs</b> a hierarchy creation algorithm (Heymann-Benz) has superior performance than when applied to individual tags, and with little impact on usability.

In this study, two transmitters per turtle were attached to loggerhead turtles (N= 15), green turtles (N= 2) and olive ridleys (N= 3) to see if mortality could be determined and to examine variability between tags. Factors examined in this paper were reception duration or how long we received tag data, the habitat area where transmissions stopped, and the differences between reception duration. The results show that variation in transmission reception between identical transmitters ranged widely. Five of our 20 pairs (25 %) had significant differences in duration between the tag pairs {{that could not be}} explained with normal tag variation; Four pairs had zero days difference in duration between the <b>tag</b> <b>pair.</b> Our data verifies that multiple factors need to be examined {{in order to determine the}} final outcome of tracking due to the variability in tags...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{predominance}} of social semantics {{in the form}} of tagging presents the metadata community with both opportunities and challenges as for leveraging this new form of information content representation and for retrieval. One key challenge is the absence of contextual information associated with these tags. This paper presents an experiment working with Flickr tags as an example of utilizing social semantics sources for enriching subject metadata. The procedure included four steps: 1) Collecting a sample of Flickr tags, 2) Calculating cooccurrences between tags through mutual information, 3) Tracing contextual information of <b>tag</b> <b>pairs</b> via Google search results, 4) Applying natural language processing and machine learning techniques to extract semantic relations between tags. The experiment helped us to build a context sentence collection from the Google search results, which was then processed by natural language processing and machine learning algorithms.

We examined the possible effects of 1. 5 -g geolocators (dimensions: 21 x 6. 5 x 9 mm) on the breeding success and survival of migratory Lesser Kestrels (Falco naumanni). During the 2007 breeding season, kestrels were fitted with geolocators using two attachment methods (Teflon wing harnesses and darvic bands), and geolocators were removed in 2008 after the birds returned to the breeding grounds. We found no differences in the breeding success of control and <b>tagged</b> <b>pairs</b> during the 2007 breeding season, but <b>tagged</b> <b>pairs</b> had greater fledgling mortality in the following breeding season.

As for return rates, 75 % of tagged birds came back to the colony after the nonbreeding period, a proportion similar to that reported in previous studies.

40|$|As {{a growing}} number of {{complementary}} transcripts, susceptible to exert various regulatory functions, are being found in eukaryotes, high throughput analytical methods are needed to investigate their expression in multiple biological samples. Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE), based on the enumeration of directionally reliable short cDNA sequences (tags), is capable of revealing antisense transcripts. We initially detected them by observing tags that mapped on to the reverse complement of known mRNAs. The presence of such tags in individual SAGE libraries suggested that SAGE datasets contain latent information on antisense transcripts. We raised a collection of virtual tags for mining these data. <b>Tag</b> <b>pairs</b> were assembled by searching for complementarities between 24 -nt long sequences centered on the potential SAGE-anchoring sites of well-annotated human expressed sequences. An analysis of their presence in a large collection of published SAGE libraries revealed transcripts expressed at high levels from both strands of two adjacent, oppositely oriented, transcription units. In other cases, the respective transcripts of such cis-oriented genes displayed a mutually exclusive expression pattern or were co-expressed in a small number of libraries. Other <b>tag</b> <b>pairs</b> revealed overlapping transcripts of trans-encoded unique genes. Finally, we isolated a group of tags shared by multiple transcripts. Most of them mapped on to retroelements, essentially represented in humans by Alu sequences inserted in opposite orientations in the 3 ′UTR of otherwise different mRNAs. Registering these tags in separate files makes possible computational searches focused on unique sense–antisense pairs. The method developed in the present work shows that SAGE datasets constitute a major resource of rapidly investigating with high sensitivity the expression of antisense transcripts, so that a single tag may be detected in one library when screening a large number of biological samples...|$|R
