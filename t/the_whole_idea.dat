They get married and tell their friends about the news, despite Grace's best friend Will's (Eric McCormack) unease about <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>idea.</b> Grace and Leo decide to host a wedding reception for themselves, but at the festivity, Grace learns unsettling details about Leo, which gives her reason to wonder if she has made a mistake.|$|E

25|$|Episode 32 of MythBusters {{investigates the}} urban legend of an {{affordable}} jet pack or rocket pack {{that can be}} built from plans purchased on the Internet. Extensive modifications {{were made by the}} MythBusters team due to vagueness in the plans and because of the infeasibility of the specified engine mounting system. The jet pack produced by the MythBusters had two ducted fans powered by ultralight-type piston engines. (Fans complained that the use of piston engines destroyed <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> of the pack's being truly based on jets, by which, presumably, they meant self-contained gas turbines.) They found it was not powerful enough to lift a person off the ground, and was expensive to build. The plans specified a Rotax 503 ultralight engine, but they intended to use the more powerful and lighter Rotax 583 engine before a similar lighter unnamed engine was substituted.|$|E
25|$|When her great-uncle's sole heir, Sarah Lockwood Winchester, {{the widow}} of his son William Wirt Winchester, died in September 1922, part of the multi-million dollar estate was left to Olive Winchester. Additionally, Winchester was the {{beneficiary}} of 25% of a substantial estate of her maternal great uncle, Levi Merrick Stewart (born December 10, 1827 in Corinna, Maine; died May 3, 1910 in Minneapolis, Minnesota). Following these inheritances, in 1922 Winchester provided the funds to build a home for Wiley at Northwest Nazarene College. According to Ingersol, Throughout her tenure at Northwest Nazarene, Winchester taught her specialties: Biblical language and literature. But she also grew interested in <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> of religious education in the local church, and at Northwest Nazarene she developed and taught the initial courses in religious education. She spurred further interest in that emerging discipline by contributing frequent articles on religious education to church papers and curriculum resource manuals.|$|E

A marriage between Platonic notions of interpretation {{and the quest for}} meaning with the interpretive theories of Friedrich Schleiermacher, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Wilhelm Dilthey, and Hans-Georg Gadamer is suggested. Schleiermacher argues that understanding cannot focus primarily on parts (words) without considering the effect the parts may have on <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> (<b>ideas).</b> In addition, von Humboldt contended that meaning is coproduced by the speaker and listener and is woven with cultural threads.

30|$|The NRED {{algorithm}} provides fairness {{based on}} the estimated size of a distributed queue.

On <b>the</b> <b>whole,</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of QE & FF is quiet promising, and simulation results show that the FF mechanism can improve the throughput of UDP, but also that there is high variance in the round trip time (RTT) of TCP with the FF mechanism. Thus, TCP fails to perform better due to this high variance in RTT.|$|R
25|$|Until the Middle Ages, {{the peak}} area of Karkonosze {{remained}} untouched; {{the first people}} to explore it were treasure hunters looking for gold, and shepherds. Already in the 18th century ascents to the Sněžka/Śnieżka were fairly common, albeit the forms of organised tourism appeared {{in the second half of}} 19th century, along with railway access to Jelenia Góra, Szklarska Poręba and Karpacz. Before the rush time for Karkonosze, Śnieżka was climbed amongst others by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In that period many shepherd's huts were built, called in German Baude and bouda in Czech. Some of them were developed later in mountain huts, which exist even now, e.g. Lucni Bouda. Due to the industrial revolution and the period of prosperity (which corresponds to Victorian times in England) tourism and hiking became popular. This was about the time, when the whole network of roads and trails, altogether ca 300km, was constructed in both Silesian and Bohemian parts of the mountains. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> was conceived, implemented and managed by two mountain clubs, Austrian Riesengebirgenverein and German Riesengebirgenverein. All the main paths and trails, including these in the alpine area, had been constructed before World War I. The trail, later dubbed Polish-Czech Friendship Trail, was completed before the end of the 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century the upper zones of the range were a busy tourist region with numerous huts and other facilities.|$|E
