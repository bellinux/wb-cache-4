5|$|The 1799 {{constitution}} contained, for {{the first}} time, {{the power of the}} governor to veto legislation; this power was substantially similar to, and probably based upon, that found in the 1792 New Hampshire Constitution and the 1798 Georgia Constitution. The governor's veto can be overridden by a majority vote of both houses of the legislature. The 1891 constitution empowered the governor with a line-item veto, but its use was forbidden on constitutional amendments and laws related to the classification of property for <b>tax</b> <b>purposes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Atari created prototypes for {{location}} testing, but {{the game}} did not fare well against more popular titles at the time such as Street Fighter II. Atari assumed the track balls accounted for the poor reception and commissioned a second model with joystick controls. Because the new models were met with the same poor reception, production was halted and the focus shifted to Guardians of the 'Hood, a beat 'em up game. An urban legend states that when WMS Industries purchased Time Warner Interactive (the company which Atari Games had since merged into) in 1996, they ran a steamroller over the Marble Madness II boards in order to clear inventory for <b>tax</b> <b>purposes.</b> In actuality, no Marble Madness II boards were made apart from the prototypes, and according to Cerny at most 12 of these exist. These prototypes have since become collector items.|$|E

In its election campaign, the CCF did not promise to nationalize any industries. It promised changes in the tax code in order to increase the redistribution of wealth in Canada. It pledged to increase exemptions from income tax, to allow medical expenses to be considered deductions from income for <b>tax</b> <b>purposes,</b> and to eliminate sales tax on food, clothing, and other necessities of life. It also promised to raise taxes on the higher income brackets and to eliminate the favourable tax treatment of corporate dividends.|$|E

5|$|The Abir Congo Company (founded as the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company {{and later}} {{known as the}} Compagnie du Congo Belge) was a company that {{exploited}} natural rubber in the Congo Free State, the private property of King Leopold II of Belgium. The company was founded with British and Belgian capital and was based in Belgium. By 1898 there were no longer any British shareholders and the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company {{changed its name to}} the Abir Congo Company and changed its residence for <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> to the Free State. The company was granted a large concession in the north of the country and the rights to tax the inhabitants. This tax was taken in the form of rubber obtained from a relatively rare rubber vine. The collection system revolved around a series of trade posts along the two main rivers in the concession. Each post was commanded by a European agent and manned with armed sentries to enforce taxation and punish any rebels.|$|E

In late 2009, the South Bay Expressway partnership that operated the road questioned {{the value of the}} toll road for property <b>tax</b> <b>purposes,</b> saying that it was worth $330 million less than it was originally valued due to the low volumes of traffic using the road. On March 22, 2010, the toll road's operator filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing traffic counts running at less than 40 percent of initial estimates due to the economic downturn. Some drivers chose not to use the toll road due to a recent increase in tolls. An editorial in the San Diego Union-Tribune also blamed the delay in opening the toll road and the associated penalties, interest, and legal fees for the company's financial status. According to the bankruptcy filing, the expressway had $510 million of loans outstanding, of which $170 million was owed to the U.S. Department of Transportation. In addition, there was over $600 million of unresolved litigation with the construction contractors. The gross earnings (EBITDA) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 were approximately $3 million on revenues of $21 million.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Indonesian governments employ self {{assessment}} system in running its tax system. Through this system, governments trust wise tax payers to count, report, and execute the payment by themselves according to their earned income. The different treatment between accounting for commercial purpose and accounting for <b>tax</b> <b>purpose</b> make different treatment in revenue and expense recognition and further, result in different income numbers. Tax reporting mechanism emerges different interest between governments and tax payers. Governments are willing to maximize the tax rate while tax payers are willing to minimize tax burden. This study aims to examine whether there is earnings management difference between the financial report for commercial <b>purpose</b> and for <b>tax</b> reporting <b>purpose.</b> This population {{of the study is}} the company tax payers reporting their tax reports at Kantor Pelayanan Pajak (Tax Office) in Tegal and Purwokerto during the period of 2001 - 2003. It also must have done the bookkeeping according to the Act number 16 (2000) section 28 subsection 1. The method of analysis employs the Rangan’s analytical model. Paired sample t test is employed to test the hypothesis. Using SPSS 12. 0, the results show 2. 748 in t-statistic at level of significance 0. 05 and hence, the alternative hypothesis is accepted. It means that there is different discretionary accruals behavior between financial report for commercial <b>purpose</b> and <b>tax</b> <b>purpose.</b> Further, this different is affected dominantly by the change in revenue.
