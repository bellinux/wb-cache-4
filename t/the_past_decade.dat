30|$|Standard {{numerical}} {{methods for}} partial differential equations are established {{under the assumption}} of classical differentiability. Routine finite difference schemes of first order usually smear or smoothen the solution {{in the vicinity of}} discontinuities as they come with intrinsic numerical viscosity. Standard second-order methods often suffer from the Gibbs phenomenon, where oscillations around shocks emerge. In <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>decades</b> so-called high-resolution methods have been developed in order to achieve proper accuracy and resolution for nonlinear, discontinuous problems as they appear also in RHD or MHD. High order explicit Gudonov schemes have been dominating numerical applications and literature for <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>decades.</b> This trend was amplified by the enormous advancements made in parallel computing over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>decades.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Melbourne Storm has {{a strong}} rivalry with Brisbane, built {{in large part on}} the large number of finals games played between the teams, {{including}} one final in each year from 2004 to 2009; the Storm winning all but one of them.

5|$|The modern post-industrial era in {{advertising}} {{was one of}} reaffirming widely held social values, such as heterosexuality and the middle-class, while neglecting alternative values or lifestyles.

In <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>decade,</b> however, many advertising agencies have begun to more accurately capture reality and the diversity of lifestyles and family types of consumers.|$|E

5|$|However, {{without the}} ability to {{effectively}} track weak laser signals, collection of atmospheric data would be relegated to times of day where the sun's electromagnetic emissions did not drown out the laser's signal.

For <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>decade,</b> Faraday filters have been used to do this.
