5|$|Drier {{parts of}} the country are highly prone <b>to</b> <b>dust</b> storms. These include areas west of Buenos Aires, which can average more than eight dust storms per year, and parts of Patagonia, owing to its aridity and windy climate. Certain areas in the Altiplano are also highly prone <b>to</b> <b>dust</b> storms owing to {{extensive}} areas of closed depressions and the presence of salt flats that erode the rock, which becomes a source of fine material that can travel large distances during periods of strong wind. Dust storms are more frequent during droughts, particularly in agricultural areas. Dust storms can effect large areas, leading to numerous impacts. These dust storms can lead to loss of crop and livestock, affecting the local economy. Productive topsoil may be lost during dust storms, leading to loss in soil productivity, which can increase soil erosion and negatively affect crop productivity in the long term. In addition to the impact on agriculture, dust storms can damage cars and buildings, lower visibility on roads, affect air quality, and affect water quality in rivers and lakes.|$|E

5|$|The storm sent a {{plume of}} {{moisture}} throughout the Arabian Peninsula, contributing <b>to</b> <b>dust</b> storms {{as far north as}} Iraq. However, the effects were most severe in Yemen, becoming the second-worst natural disaster in the country after deadly floods in 1996. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in a normally arid region, reaching around , which caused flash flooding in valleys after waterways were unable to contain the approximately 2billionkm3 (528billion gallons) of water that fell. Poor drainage practices and an invasive species of weed contributed to the floods, which damaged or destroyed 6,505houses, leaving about 25,000people homeless. The floods killed 180people and severely disrupted the livelihoods of about 700,000residents of Hadhramaut and Al Mahrah governorates, mostly farmers whose fields were washed away. Some of the buildings at the Shibam UNESCO World Heritage Site collapsed due to the floods. Overall damage was estimated at US$874.8million, although residual losses from damaged infrastructure were estimated to cost an additional US$726.9million. The overall economic impact of the storm was therefore estimated at US$1.638billion, equating to roughly 6% of the country's gross domestic product.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} whether occupational exposures <b>to</b> <b>dusts</b> and {{chemicals in the}} Shanghai textile industry are associated with risk of pancreatic cancer. Methods: A case cohort study nested in a cohort of 267 400 female textile workers in Shanghai, China was conducted among 180 incident pancreatic cancer cases and an age stratified randomly selected comparison subcohort (n = 3188). A complete occupational history {{of work in the}} textile industry was obtained for each woman, and was linked to a job exposure matrix developed for the textile industry to estimate exposures <b>to</b> specific <b>dusts</b> and chemicals. Cumulative exposures <b>to</b> cotton <b>dust</b> and endotoxin were reconstructed from historical and contemporaneous measurements. Results: After adjusting for smoking status, a trend of decreasing risk of pancreatic cancer was observed for increasing cumulative exposures <b>to</b> cotton <b>dust</b> and endotoxin with a lag of 20 years. The hazard ratios for women cumulatively exposed to. 143. 4 mg/m 36 years of cotton dust and. 3530. 6 EU/m 36 years of endotoxin were 0. 6 (95 % CI 0. 3 to 0. 9) and 0. 5 (95 % CI 0. 3 to 0. 9), respectively, compared to unexposed women. There was little evidence that exposures <b>to</b> other textile <b>dusts</b> and chemicals were associated with risk of pancreatic cancer.

40|$|Respiratory {{symptoms}} and ventilatory function changes {{in relation to}} length of exposure <b>to</b> cotton <b>dust</b> E. ZUgKIN and F. VALIC Andrija Stampar School of Public Health, Zagreb University, Zagreb, Yugoslavia The prevalence of byssinosis, respiratory symptoms, acute changes of ventilatory capacity over the shift, and chronic changes of ventilatory capacity were studied in two groups of non-smoking female workers exposed to practically identical concentrations of {{the same type of}} cotton dust but for very different periods of time (16 and 4 years respectively). The prevalence of non-specific respiratory symptoms increased with the duration of exposure <b>to</b> cotton <b>dust</b> only in the subjects with byssinosis. Exposure <b>to</b> cotton <b>dust</b> caused significant reductions over the shift of the mean FEV 1. o, FVC and PEF in all the groups of cotton workers examined. In byssinotics the reduction in ventilatory capacity was considerably greater in subjects with longer than in those with shorter exposure <b>to</b> cotton <b>dust,</b> while in non-byssinotics the response was approximately equal in the two groups. Inhalation of a bronchodilator {{at the end of the}} shift restored ventilatory function to its pre-shift values except in byssinotics with a longer duration of exposure <b>to</b> cotton <b>dust.</b> Chronic changes of ventilatory capacity developed only in subjects with a longer exposure <b>to</b> cotton <b>dust</b> and were common in the byssinotics. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that exposure <b>to</b> cotton <b>dust</b> may cause respiratory symptoms accompanied by changes of lung func-tion. The diagnosis of byssinosis is based on the characteristic history of chest tightness, cough, and wheezing, predominantly on the first working day after a break of more than one day of exposure <b>to</b> active <b>dust.</b> Later, the same symptoms occur on subsequent days of the week, and chronic cough and dyspnoea may persist even during absence from work.

Levels of lignite dust in workplace were measured. Univariate and multivariate {{analysis of the data}} were performed. The concentration of lignite dust varied from 0. 6 to 1. 4 mg/m 3. Current smokers and workers exposed <b>to</b> lignite <b>dust</b> presented higher prevalence of chronic bronchitis symptoms and of FEV< 80 % and FEV 1 /FVC< 70 %. Multivariate analysis has shown that smoking and occupational exposure <b>to</b> lignite <b>dust</b> were independent predictors of chronic bronchitis symptoms, as well as of an obstructive ventilation pattern. Further analysis showed that exposed workers who were current smokers presented a five fold rate for developing an obstructive ventilation pattern in comparison to exposed workers non currently smokers. Occupational exposure <b>to</b> lignite <b>dust</b> and smoking were independent determinants of chronic bronchitis symptoms and obstructive ventilation pattern. There is some evidence for a combined effect of smoking and lignite dust exposure on respiratory system...|$|R
