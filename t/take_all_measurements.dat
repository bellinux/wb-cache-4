40|$|The authors {{describe}} a performance {{study of a}} trial switched multimegabit data service (SMDS) link (intended for inter-LAN connection) {{from the perspective of}} customers evaluating the feasibility of the link for some target applications. The goals were to <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>measurements</b> on the customer premises and to develop a methodology general enough to be used by customers to evaluate the link. The authors measured a lightly loaded system and developed a model of the SMDS connection suitable for evaluating applications via analysis or simulation. They document their methodology and present the SMDS connection delay values as well as a likely breakdown of the constituents of that delay. They used these data to create a simulation model and to simulate a simple application. In the trial configuration, where geographical distances were small, SMDS network delay was one of the notable components of end-to-end delay in the SMDS connection. However, for most packets, throughput is limited by the T 1 capacity for transmitting SMDS cells, not by the SMDS network capacity...|$|E
40|$|In May of {{this year}} died in the Rotterdam Zoological Garden the {{beautiful}} male-specimen of Cephalophus silvicultor: immediately it has been brought over to Leyden, {{so that we could}} study it in the flesh, <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>measurements</b> and make casts of different important parts. The skeleton and the highly artistic stuffed skin is now in our collection. Besides it there are in our Museum the skin of a nearly adult male with its skeleton, the skull of another adult male-specimen, the skull of a nearly adult female and finally the mounted skin of a young female with its skeleton. The latter died in 1894 in the Rotterdam Zoological Garden and is like the first mentioned adult male from the Congo: the other specimens have been procured by Mr. Jackson Demery from Liberia, Grand Cape Mount, in 1892, 1893 and 1896. The adult male from the Congo lived 9 years in the Rotterdam Garden: it therefore may be called a very adult specimen. In comparing the original description and figures of animal and horns given by Afzelius in 1815 with those in the most recently published monograph by Sclater and Oldfield Thomas in May 1895, everyone must confess that here certainly something is incorrect and that either Afzelius or the authors of the »Book of Antelopes” are wrong. Although in that Book is stated that the illustration of this species on Plate XIII is copied from a watercolour drawing taken in April 1894 by Keulemans from the very same Rotterdam-male now stuffed before me, I can assure that the mentioned illustration is perfectly incorrect...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Apical {{surgery is}} an {{important}} treatment option for teeth with post-treatment periodontitis. Although apical surgery involves root-end resection, no morphometric data are yet available about root-end resection {{and its impact on}} the root-to-crown ratio (RCR). The present study assessed the length of apicectomy and calculated the loss of root length and changes of RCR after apical surgery. METHODS In a prospective clinical study, cone-beam computed tomography scans were taken preoperatively and postoperatively. From these images, the crown and root lengths of 61 roots (54 teeth in 47 patients) were measured before and after apical surgery. Data were collected relative to the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) as well as to the crestal bone level (CBL). One observer <b>took</b> <b>all</b> <b>measurements</b> twice (to calculate the intraobserver variability), and the means were used for further analysis. The following parameters were assessed for all treated teeth as well as for specific tooth groups: length of root-end resection and percentage change of root length, preoperative and postoperative RCRs, and percentage change of RCR after apical surgery. RESULTS The mean length of root-end resection was 3. 58 ± 1. 43 mm (relative to the CBL). This amounted to a loss of 33. 2...|$|R
40|$|How much {{information}} about an unknown quantum state {{can be obtained}} by a measurement? We propose a model independent answer: the information obtained is equal to the minimum entropy of the outputs of the measurement, where the minimum is <b>taken</b> over <b>all</b> <b>measurements</b> which measure the same ``property'' of the state. This minimization is necessary because the measurement outcomes can be redundant, and this redundancy must be eliminated. We show that this minimum entropy is less or equal than the von Neumann entropy of the unknown states. That is a measurement can extract at most one meaningful bit from every qubit carried by the unknown states. Comment: 13 page...|$|R

40|$|The Waste Receiving and Processing (WRAP) facility, {{located on}} the Hanford Site in {{southeast}} Washington, is a key link in the certification of Hanford's transuranic (TRU) waste for shipment to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). Waste characterization {{is one of the}} vital functions performed at WRAP, and nondestructive assay (NDA) measurements of TRU waste containers is one of two required methods used for waste characterization (Reference 1). Various programs exist to ensure the validity of waste characterization data; all of these cite the need for clearly defined knowledge of uncertainty, associated with any <b>measurements</b> <b>taken.</b> <b>All</b> <b>measurements</b> have an inherent uncertainty associated with them. The combined effect of all uncertainties associated with a measurement {{is referred to as the}} Total Measurement Uncertainty (TMU). The NDA measurement uncertainties can be numerous and complex. In addition to system-induced measurement uncertainty, other factors contribute to the TMU, each associated with a particular measurement. The NDA measurements at WRAP are based on processes (radioactive decay and induced fission) which are statistical in nature. As a result, the proper statistical summation of the various uncertainty components is essential. This report examines the contributing factors to NDA measurement uncertainty at WRAP. The significance of each factor on the TMU is analyzed, and a final method is given for determining the TMU for NDA measurements at WRAP. As more data becomes available, and WRAP gains in operational experience, this report will be reviewed semi-annually and updated as necessary.

40|$|AIM: To {{explore the}} {{application}} of intraoperative wavefront aberrometry (IWA) for aphakia-based biometry using three existing formulae derived from autorefractive retinoscopy and introducing new improved formulae. METHODS: In 74 patients undergoing cataract surgery, three repeated measurements of aphakic spherical equivalent (SE) were <b>taken.</b> <b>All</b> <b>measurements</b> were objectively graded for their quality and evaluated with the 'limits of agreement' approach. ORs were calculated and {{analysis of variance was}} applied. The intraocular lens (IOL) power that would have given the target refraction was back-calculated from manifest refraction at 3  months postoperatively. Regression analysis was performed to generate two aphakic SE-based formulae for predicting this IOL. The accuracy of the formulae was determined by comparing them to conventional biometry and published aphakia formulae. RESULTS: In 32 eyes, three consecutive aphakic measurements were successful. Objective parameters of IWA map quality significantly impacted measurement variability (p< 0. 05). The limits of agreement of repeated aphakic SE readings were + 0. 66 dioptre (D) and - 0. 69  D. Intraoperative biometry by our formula resulted in 25 % and 53 % of all cases ± 0. 50 D and ± 1. 00  D within SE target, respectively. A second formula that took axial length (AL) into account resulted in improved ratios of 41 % and 70 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A reliable application of IWA to calculate IOL power during routine cataract surgery may not be feasible given the high rate of measurement failures and the large variations of the readings. To enable reliable IOL calculation from IWA, measurement precision must be improved and aphakic IOL formulae need to be fine-tuned...|$|R

Intra- and inter-rater agreement was assessed from 27 men runners prior to an ultra-marathon, based on measurements taken by two experienced primary care physicians (Knechtle et al. 2010 b). Intra-class correlation (ICC) within the two raters was excellent for <b>all</b> anatomical <b>measurement</b> sites and for summary measurements of skinfold thicknesses (ICC[*]>[*] 0.9).

ICC for investigator 1 versus investigator 1 and for investigator 2 versus investigator 2 for a single skinfold thickness was between 0.98 and 0.99, respectively. ICC was 0.99 - 1.00 for the sum of seven and eight skinfolds, respectively. For the sum of eight skinfolds for investigator 1, bias (i.e. average difference between investigator 1 and investigator 2) was – 0.515  mm, standard deviation of the average difference was 1.492  mm, and 95 % limits of agreement were between - 3.439  mm and 2.409  mm.|$|R
40|$|International audience— This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a fast and smart acquisition technique of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) data that has the capability to reconstruct missing data of OCT image. The main objective is to reduce the acquisition time (i. e., increase the frame rate) of an OCT-scan system by choosing a trajectory that covers entirely the image but that does not <b>take</b> <b>all</b> the <b>measurements.</b> The reconstruction of the missing data is achieved by applying an updated Fast Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) on a sparse representation of the image. Several sparse representations have been tested and the shearlets-based approach seems to outperform the other ones (e. g. wavelets, curvelets and by applying bilinear interpolation). The targeted application is a fast OCT imaging solution allowing an efficient compensation of the artefacts induced by the patient physiological motions for diagnostic purpose through optical biopsies (3 D micrometric resolution optical images). The obtained results seem promising in terms of low time processing and improvement {{of the quality of the}} reconstructed image compared to the traditional sparse acquisition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Waist, hip, {{and neck}} {{circumference}} measurements are cost-effective, non-invasive, useful markers for body fat distribution and disease risk. For epidemiology and intervention studies, including body circumference measurements in self-report surveys could be informative. However, {{few studies have}} assessed the test-retest reliability and criterion validity of a self-report tool feasible for use in large scale studies. Methods At home, mothers of young children viewed a brief, online instructional video on how to measure their waist, hip, and neck circumferences. Afterwards, they created a homemade paper measuring tape from a downloaded file with scissors and tape, <b>took</b> <b>all</b> <b>measurements</b> in duplicate, and entered them into an online survey. A few weeks later, participants visited an anthropometrics lab where they measured themselves again, and trained technicians (n[*]=[*] 9) measured participants in duplicate using standard equipment and procedures. To assess differences between self- and technician-measured circumferences, duplicate measurements for participant home self-measurements, participant lab self-measurements, and technician measurements each were averaged and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests conducted. Agreement between all possible pairs of measurements were examined using Intraclass Correlations (ICCs) and Bland-Altman plots. Results Participants (n[*]=[*] 41; aged 38. 05 [*]±[*] 3. 54 SD years; 71  % white) were all mothers that {{had at least one}} child under the age of 12  yrs. Technical error of measurements for self- and technician- duplicate measurements varied little (0. 08 to 0. 76 inches) and had very high reliability (≥ 0. 90). Intraclass Correlations (ICC) comparing self vs technician were high (0. 97, 0. 96, and 0. 84 for waist, hip, and neck). Comparison of self-measurements at home vs lab revealed high test-retest reliability (ICC[*]≥[*] 0. 87). Differences between participant self- and technician measurements were small (i. e., mean difference ranged from − 0. 13 to 0. 06 inches) with nearly all (≥ 93  %) differences within Bland-Altman limits of agreement and < 10  % exceeding the a priori clinically meaningful difference criterion. Conclusions This study has demonstrated a simple, inexpensive method for teaching novice mothers of young children to take their own body circumferences resulting in accurate, reliable data. Thus, collecting self-measured and self-reported circumference data in future studies may be a feasible approach in research protocols that has potential to expand our knowledge of body composition beyond that provided by self-reported body mass indexes...|$|R

The mean length of root-end resection was 3. 58 ± 1. 43 mm (relative to the CBL). This amounted to a loss of 33. 2 % of clinical and 26 % of anatomic root length. There was an overall significant difference between the tooth groups (P < . 05). There was also a statistically significant difference comparing mandibular and maxillary teeth (P < . 05), but not for incisors/canines versus premolars/molars (P =. 125). The mean preoperative and postoperative RCRs (relative to CEJ) were 1. 83 and 1. 35, respectively (P <. 001). With regard to the CBL reference, the mean preoperative and postoperative RCRs were 1. 08 and 0. 71 (CBL), respectively (P <. 001). The calculated changes of RCR after apical surgery were 24. 8 % relative to CEJ and 33. 3 % relative to CBL (P < . 001). Across the different tooth groups, the mean RCR was not significantly different (P =. 244 for CEJ and 0. 114 for CBL). This CBCT-based study demonstrated that the RCR is significantly changed after root-end resection in apical surgery irrespective of the clinical (CBL) or anatomic (CEJ) reference levels. The lowest, and thus clinically most critical, postoperative RCR was observed in maxillary incisors. Future clinical studies need to show the impact of resection length and RCR changes on the outcome of apical surgery...|$|R

MethodsFrom {{a total of}} 519 skeletons, we chose 84 adult excellently preserved skeletons free of antemortem and postmortem changes and <b>took</b> <b>all</b> standard <b>measurements.</b> Sex was estimated/determined using standard anthropological procedures and ancient DNA (amelogenin analysis) where pelvis was insufficiently preserved or where sex morphological indicators were not consistent. We explored which measurements showed sexual dimorphism and used them for developing univariate and multivariate discriminant functions for sex estimation. We included only those functions that reached accuracy rate 80 %. We tested the applicability of developed functions on modern Croatian sample (n= 37). ResultsFrom 69 standard skeletal measurements used in this study, 56 of them showed statistically significant sexual dimorphism (74. 7 %). We developed five univariate discriminant functions with classification rate 80. 6 %- 85. 2 % and seven multivariate discriminant functions with an accuracy rate of 81. 8 %- 93. 0 %. When tested on the modern population functions showed classification rates 74. 1 %- 100 %, and ten of them reached aimed accuracy rate. Females showed higher classification rates in the medieval populations, whereas males were better classified in the modern populations. ConclusionDeveloped discriminant functions are sufficiently accurate for reliable sex estimation in both medieval Croatian population and modern Croatian samples and {{may be used in}} forensic settings. The methodological issues that emerged regarding the importance of considering external factors in development and application of discriminant functions for sex estimation should be further explored...|$|R
30|$|As {{it could}} be expected, all methods are {{characterized}} by an MDE increase {{as a consequence of}} the gradual exclusion of fingerprints from the reference database. Nevertheless, as shown in Fig.  13, it is also worth noting that the performance obtained through the descriptors over one cell and with just one tenth of the RPs is still much better than the ones employing RSSI and all the RPs. This means that even with just one RP per environment, it is possible to find a combinations of three or four descriptors that can still guarantee good performance. This represents an important result when also the implementation issues are considered; reducing the number of “needed” reference points to get a certain accuracy allows to decrease the memory occupancy, but mainly to greatly reduce the time and the effort to <b>take</b> reference <b>measurements</b> <b>all</b> over the area of interest.|$|R

Data are uploaded to a personal computer for review and analysis. We recruited 30 patients (10 male and 20 female, age range 21 – 72 years) from the chest clinic at Guy's Hospital (n= 20) and from a GP clinic (n= 10). Patients were asked to record spirometry data using the meter at set times (8. 00 a. m. and 8. 00 p. m.) for 2 weeks. The spirometer incorporated an alarm to remind patients to <b>take</b> <b>measurements.</b> <b>All</b> patients completed the study. Mean (sd) compliance with spirometer use was 100 · 8 % (49 · 9 %). Nineteen patients had a compliance rate of between 80 % and 120 % of expected use. Timing of recordings was compared with the scheduled times of 8. 00 a. m. and 8. 00 p. m. Values recorded within ± 2 h were judged as acceptable. For morning recordings 67 · 4 % of all values and for evening recordings 71 · 7 % of all values met this criterion. Technical acceptability of spirometry data was also assessed by using quality assurance criteria recorded by the spirometer. Valid tests were performed for 75 · 2 % of all recordings.

30|$|In {{addition}} to sexually dimorphic characteristics, Morphological {{changes of the}} vertebrae {{in the form of}} marginal bony lipping or osteophytes formation, have great role in understanding ageing patterns (Kacar et al., 2016; Snodgrass, 2004). However, moderate to severe degenerative changes begin around age of 50; as lumbar vertebrae still exhibit striations between ages between 24 and 49  years, and may show only mild lipping or macro-porosity, while Vertebrae older than 50  years usually show absence of striations on the vertebral body, moderate to excessive vertebral degeneration, as osteophytes, lipping, and macro-porosity (Smith, 2010). So, it may be of interest to assess how non-pathologic aging effects, independent from degenerative alterations, are reflected on the vertebrae (Ruhli et al., 2005). Although Ruhli and his colleagues reached that only 20 % of <b>all</b> <b>taken</b> vertebral <b>measurements</b> demonstrate significant changes by aging, Mavrych et al.
