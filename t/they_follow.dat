These include Gudi Padwa, Rama Navami, Hanuman Jayanti, Narali Pournima, Mangala Gaur, Krishna Janmashtami, Ganesh Chaturthi, Kojagiri Purnima, Diwali, Khandoba Festival (Champa Shashthi), Makar Sankranti, Maha Shivaratri and Holi.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{can also}} irreversibly {{inactivate}} enzymes, usually by covalently modifying active site residues. These reactions, {{which may be}} called suicide substrates, follow exponential decay functions and are usually saturable. Below saturation, <b>they</b> <b>follow</b> first order kinetics with respect to inhibitor.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bird species}} arid regions across {{southern}} Australia are nomadic; <b>they</b> <b>follow</b> {{water and food}} supply {{around the country in}} an irregular pattern, unrelated to season but related to rainfall. Several years may pass between visits to an area by a particular species.|$|E
6000|$|He rose disgustedly {{and went}} out. <b>They</b> <b>followed</b> him in singie file. The {{rest of the}} town [...] "caught on." [...] Frank Graham heaved an apple at him and joined the procession. Rob went into the store to buy some tobacco. <b>They</b> <b>followed</b> and perched like crows on the {{counters}} till he went out; then <b>they</b> <b>followed</b> him, as before. They watched him check his trunk; they witnessed {{the purchase of the}} ticket. The town had turned out by this time.|$|R

5|$|As {{originally}} described, the Nazarov cyclization {{involves the}} activation of a divinyl ketone using a stoichiometric Lewis acid or protic acid promoter. The key {{step of the}} reaction mechanism involves a cationic 4π-electrocyclic ring closure which forms the cyclopentenone product (See Mechanism below). As the reaction has been developed, variants involving substrates other than divinyl ketones and promoters other than Lewis acids have been subsumed under the name Nazarov cyclization provided that <b>they</b> <b>follow</b> a similar mechanistic pathway.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth enjoys {{his time}} with the Giant but is forced to explain the nature of death when they witness hunters kill a deer. One day, Hogarth is playing with the Giant using a toy gun. The Giant involuntarily reveals several {{powerful}} weapons, and Dean rescues Hogarth before one strikes him. The Giant reverts to its docile form and Dean orders him away for Hogarth's safety, but Hogarth gives chase. Dean realizes the Giant was acting in self-defense and quickly catches up to Hogarth as <b>they</b> <b>follow</b> the Giant into town.|$|E
5|$|In Atlanta, Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), Daryl (Norman Reedus), Glenn (Steven Yeun) and T-Dog (IronE Singleton) have {{discovered}} the severed hand of Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker), Daryl's brother, where Rick had handcuffed him {{on the roof of}} a store. <b>They</b> <b>follow</b> a trail of blood to show Merle had killed some walkers and managed to cauterize the stump of his hand before the trail goes cold.|$|E

5|$|In Michigan, I-69 {{currently}} has four business loops. These highways, each designated Business Loop I-69 (BL I-69), provide access {{from the main}} freeway through the downtown districts of adjacent cities. <b>They</b> <b>follow</b> former routings used by I-69's predecessor highways (US27, M-78 and M-21) as well connecting roads. The cities served by these loops are: Coldwater, Charlotte, Lansing, and Port Huron.|$|E
5|$|In {{his fourth}} year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, Bach {{performed}} 18 cantatas composed by his relative Johann Ludwig Bach, a court musician in Meiningen. He then set {{some of the}} texts himself, including this cantata, written probably by Ernst Ludwig, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. <b>They</b> <b>follow</b> a pattern: seven movements are divided in two parts, both beginning with biblical quotations, Part I from the Old Testament, Part II from the New Testament.|$|E
5|$|The episode opens {{showing a}} horde of walkers as <b>they</b> <b>follow</b> a {{helicopter}} overhead, leaving Atlanta and migrating to the countryside over several days. As they near the Greene farm, they {{hear the sound of}} a gunshotfrom the shot that Carl (Chandler Riggs) used to kill a reanimated Shane Walshand they turn to head towards the farm. As Rick (Andrew Lincoln) escorts Carl back to the others, the walker horde emerges from the forest, and Rick and Carl take shelter in the barn.|$|E

5|$|The frescoes {{inside the}} church are {{commonly}} dated to the 14th–15th century, though <b>they</b> <b>follow</b> a standard compositional model which had been established in Bulgarian church decoration since the 13th century. Unusually, most of the captions which accompany the images are in Byzantine Greek, though a few are in Old Church Slavonic. In terms of style, the murals {{have much in common}} with churches from the southwestern Bulgarian lands.|$|E
5|$|The fully healed Fisher and Briggs then deploy to Philadelphia. When {{they find}} four bombs being loaded onto trains, <b>they</b> <b>follow</b> the bombs to a rail yard and disarm them. Boarding a departing train of Engineers, Fisher fights {{his way through}} the cars and pursues an Engineer leader (who escapes into a station and is killed by a police officer).|$|E
5|$|The two {{travel through}} more zones and fight Eggman {{at the end}} of each one. <b>They</b> <b>follow</b> Eggman to a forest, where he leads a massive logging operation. Together with Mighty the Armadillo, they destroy his {{machinery}} and stop the operation. They continue through the forest and find ghosts that frighten Tails. Destroying one of Eggman's robots lets Sonic see its internal architecture, including a screen that shows Eggman's plans to create an empire and drop a floating island into the sea.|$|E
50|$|After {{assembling}} {{a party of}} 21 men, the expedition commenced on September 21, 1821. <b>They</b> <b>followed</b> the Verdigris north to the confluence with the Caney River, where they camped near the present site of Bartlesville, Oklahoma. They continued north into Kansas Territory, then proceeded to the Arkansas River, near present-day Wichita, Kansas. Then <b>they</b> <b>followed</b> the river into Colorado Territory.|$|R
60|$|The {{earliest}} of {{them were}} hunters. Their chief pursuit was the wild horse, the little bearded pony of that time. <b>They</b> <b>followed</b> it as it moved after pasture. And also <b>they</b> <b>followed</b> the bison. <b>They</b> knew the mammoth, because they have left us strikingly effective pictures of that creature. To judge by one rather ambiguous drawing they trapped and killed it.|$|R

5|$|Von Neumann made {{fundamental}} {{contributions to}} mathematical statistics. In 1941, he derived the exact {{distribution of the}} ratio of the mean square of successive differences to the sample variance for independent and identically normally distributed variables. This ratio was applied to the residuals from regression models and is commonly known as the Durbin–Watson statistic for testing the null hypothesis that the errors are serially independent against the alternative that <b>they</b> <b>follow</b> a stationary first order autoregression.|$|E
5|$|After Monica Dawson (Dana Davis) is {{captured}} by a street gang, Micah Sanders (Noah Gray-Cabey) {{turns to his}} mother Niki (Ali Larter) for help. Despite the fact that Niki no longer has her powers due to the virus, she agrees to help. <b>They</b> <b>follow</b> a GPS signal emitted by Monica's cell phone and find her in an abandoned warehouse. She is tied up and the warehouse is burning around her. Using what remains of her superhuman strength, Niki manages to help Monica escape, but her strength eventually fails and she ends up trapped inside the building as it explodes.|$|E
5|$|After {{destroying}} the gravity well, Del Rio orders a retreat back to Earth, doubting the Chief and Cortana's testimony. The Master Chief disobeys orders to stand down and relinquish the malfunctioning Cortana, and stays behind {{to oppose the}} Didact. Infinity executive officer Commander Lasky gives Chief an armed transport and wishes him luck. Chief and Cortana attempt to sabotage the Didact's ship before he leaves, but when they are unsuccessful <b>they</b> <b>follow</b> the Didact to a Halo ring, Installation 03. The Composer has been moved from the ring onto the nearby Ivanoff Research Station, which the Covenant attack. The Chief defends Ivanoff, but the Didact retrieves the Composer and uses it on the station, composing every individual except the Chief.|$|E

5|$|An {{exception}} {{to all of}} this would be the Primal Zerg, who inhabit the original Zerg homeworld of Zerus (as seen in Heart of the Swarm). The Zerg Hive Mind was created to control the Zerg, and eventually put them {{under the control of the}} main antagonist of the series, the fallen Xel'Naga Amon. Some Zerg, however, managed to avoid being subsumed. These are the Primal Zerg, who have much the same genetic abilities but are not bound to the Overmind. These creatures are each independently sapient, and if <b>they</b> <b>follow</b> a leader it is because they choose to. Their lack of a Hive Mind also shields them from specific psionic attacks engineered to counter the Zerg Hive Mind.|$|E
5|$|As one road, NY14 and NY414 travel down Franklin Street, {{the main}} {{thoroughfare}} of Watkins Glen. The routes pass by several blocks of homes as <b>they</b> <b>follow</b> the western {{base of the}} ravine and meet {{the east end of}} NY329, which ascends the side of the valley to serve Watkins Glen State Park. NY414 continues to follow NY14 to Watkins Glen's central business district, where NY414 splits from the overlap to travel east at an intersection that also acts as the eastern terminus of NY409. From this point north, NY14 and NY414 follow opposite sides of Seneca Lake, with NY414 running along the east lake shore.|$|E
5|$|In Vagrant Story, the Iocus priesthood of {{the kingdom}} of Valendia is shown to use the Kildean rood as a symbol, {{although}} <b>they</b> <b>follow</b> the teachings of a saint named Iocus instead of the original Kildean teachings of the Kiltia religion of Leá Monde. Müllenkamp, founder of the city of Leá Monde featured in the story, used to be a priestess of Kiltia, and bore the rood on her back. The followers of St. Iocus are outwardly intolerant of magic, seeing it as an abomination, and yet its higher members continue to use it behind the scenes. This hypocrisy is revealed {{over the course of the}} story, though it goes unresolved.|$|E
