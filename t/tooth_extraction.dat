5|$|Alveolar osteitis is a {{complication}} of <b>tooth</b> <b>extraction</b> (especially lower wisdom teeth) {{in which the}} blood clot is not formed or is lost, leaving the socket where the tooth used to be empty, and bare bone is exposed to the mouth. The pain is moderate to severe, and dull, aching, and throbbing in character. The pain is localized to the socket, and may radiate. It normally starts two to {{four days after the}} extraction, and may last 10–40 days. Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic dressings, which are typically required for five to seven days. There is some evidence that chlorhexidine mouthwash used prior to extractions prevents alveolar osteitis.|$|E
5|$|For the dentist, {{the goal}} of {{treatment}} generally is to relieve the pain, and wherever possible to preserve or restore function. The treatment depends on {{the cause of the}} toothache, and frequently a clinical decision regarding the current state and long-term prognosis of the affected tooth, as well as the individual's wishes and ability to cope with dental treatment, will influence the treatment choice. Often, administration of an intra-oral local anesthetic such as lidocaine and epinephrine is indicated in order to carry out pain-free treatment. Treatment may range from simple advice, removal of dental decay with a dental drill and subsequent placement of a filling, to root canal treatment, <b>tooth</b> <b>extraction,</b> or debridement.|$|E
40|$|Teeth loss {{represents}} {{a major concern}} for the global oral health status of a population. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the prevalence of <b>teeth</b> <b>extraction</b> among the Italian adult population, analyzing the association between <b>teeth</b> <b>extraction</b> in the last 12 months and socio-demographic characteristics. This cross-sectional study is based on the national survey ‘Health Conditions and Healthcare Services Use’, carried out by the Italian National Centre of Statistics (ISTAT) in 2005. A univariate analysis was performed to investigate the association between the dependent and the independent variables (<b>teeth</b> <b>extraction</b> Vs socio-demographic characteristics). Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the influence on the outcome (<b>teeth</b> <b>extraction</b> Yes/No). The present study highlights the relationship between <b>teeth</b> <b>extraction</b> and socio-demographic factors. Out of 128, 040 individuals, the sampled population consisted of 124, 677 subjects, representing 56, 400, 323 individuals in the Italian population.

40|$|There {{are many}} reports about <b>tooth</b> <b>extractions</b> of {{patients}} taking warfarin?, however PT-INR level {{is used to}} examine the postoperative bleeding in patients. To investigate other factors, postoperative bleeding, age, gender, PT- NR level, combined use of antiplatelet drugs, conditions of extracted tooth, a number of <b>tooth</b> <b>extractions</b> at a treatment, methods of management for warfarin? therapy, degree of the alveolar bone loss and size of radiolucency of apical region were examined in this study. To apply Mann-Whitney U-test andx 2 -test, ninety-three patients (38 male and 55 female) who took warfarin? and visited our clinic for <b>tooth</b> <b>extractions</b> from April 1994 to November 2002 were classified into 2 groups : One group showed hemostasis by the next day (77 patients), the other showed the continuous bleeding after the next day (16 patients). These analyses indicated that PT-INR level, a number of <b>tooth</b> <b>extractions</b> at a treatment, methods of management for warfarin* therapy, and size of radiolucency of apical region influenced postoperative bleeding. In addition, stepwise logistic regression analysis was applied to all of the factors, obtained from 77 patients out of 93 patients. This data showed that PT-INR level, a number of <b>tooth</b> <b>extractions</b> at a treatment and methods of management for warfarin? therapy influenced postoperative bleeding. These results suggest that before the <b>tooth</b> <b>extractions</b> not only PT-INR level but methods of management for warfarin? therapy and size of wound could be important to control the postoperative bleeding in warfarin? taking patients...|$|R
5|$|Non-dental {{sources of}} pain often cause {{multiple}} teeth to hurt {{and have an}} epicenter that is either above or below the jaws. For instance, cardiac pain (which can make the bottom teeth hurt) usually radiates up from the chest and neck, and sinusitis (which can make the back top teeth hurt) is worsened by bending over. As all of these conditions may mimic toothache, {{it is possible that}} dental treatment, such as fillings, root canal treatment, or <b>tooth</b> <b>extraction</b> may be carried out unnecessarily by dentists in an attempt to relieve the individual's pain, and as a result the correct diagnosis is delayed. A hallmark {{is that there is no}} obvious dental cause, and signs and symptoms elsewhere in the body may be present. As migraines are typically present for many years, the diagnosis is easier to make. Often the character of the pain is the differentiator between dental and non-dental pain.|$|E
5|$|Pericoronitis is {{inflammation}} of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The lower wisdom tooth is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is a flap of gum (an operculum), overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which {{is an area that}} is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom tooth also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. Periodontitis and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the soft tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, swelling and tenderness of the gum over the tooth. There may be trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), facial swelling, and rubor (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late teens and early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the operculum with an antiseptic solution, painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by <b>tooth</b> <b>extraction</b> or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.|$|E
25|$|Alveolar osteitis is {{inflammation}} of the alveolar bone (i.e., the alveolar process of the maxilla or mandible). Classically, this occurs as a postoperative complication of <b>tooth</b> <b>extraction.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{predictive}} role of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), {{number of}} <b>tooth</b> <b>extractions,</b> and oral infections for mortality {{in people with}} and without diabetes is unclear. This prospective cohort study is a 12 1 / 2 -year follow-up of the Oslo II study, a health survey in 2000. In all, 12, 764 men were invited. Health information was retrieved from 6434 elderly men through questionnaire information, serum measurements, and anthropometric and blood pressure measurements. Diabetes was reported by 425 men. Distinct differences were observed in baseline characteristics in individuals with and without diabetes. In the diabetes group, age and hs-CRP were statistically significant whereas in the nondiabetes group, age, hs-CRP, number of <b>tooth</b> <b>extractions,</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>extractions</b> for infections and oral infections combined, nonfasting glucose, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, regular alcohol drinking, daily smoking, and level of education were independent risk factors. The number of <b>tooth</b> <b>extractions</b> < 5 was inversely related whereas more extractions increased the risk. Multivariate analyses showed that hs-CRP {{was a significant predictor}} in persons with diabetes and <b>tooth</b> <b>extractions</b> and oral infections combined; the number of teeth extracted and hs-CRP were for persons without diabetes. Infection and inflammation were associated with mortality in individuals both with and without diabetes...|$|R

50|$|An {{extraction}} {{can also}} serve as treatment for dental caries. The removal of the decayed tooth is performed if the tooth is too far destroyed from the decay process to effectively restore the <b>tooth.</b> <b>Extractions</b> are sometimes considered if the tooth lacks an opposing tooth or will probably cause further problems in the future, as {{may be the case}} for wisdom <b>teeth.</b> <b>Extractions</b> may also be preferred by people unable or unwilling to undergo the expense or difficulties in restoring the tooth.|$|R
25|$|Dry socket is {{more likely}} to occur where there is a {{pre-existing}} infection in the mouth, such as necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis or chronic periodontitis. Wisdom teeth not associated with pericoronitis are less likely to cause a dry socket when extracted. The oral microbiota has been demonstrated to have fibrinolytic action in some individuals, and these persons may be predisposed to developing dry sockets after <b>tooth</b> <b>extraction.</b> Infection of the socket following <b>tooth</b> <b>extraction</b> is different from dry socket, although in dry socket secondary infection may occur in addition.|$|E
25|$|Dry socket is {{more likely}} to occur {{following}} a difficult <b>tooth</b> <b>extraction.</b> It is thought that excessive force applied to the tooth, or excessive movement of the tooth burnishes the bony walls of the socket and crushes blood vessels, impairing the repair process. It has also been shown that dry socket {{is more likely}} to occur when an inexperienced surgeon performed the extraction, possibly because excessive force or excessive tooth movements are used.|$|E
25|$|A 1970 {{research}} study of 1012 patients by Jozewicz showed denture wearers {{had a significantly}} higher rate of bone loss. Tallgren’s 25-year study in 1972 also showed denture wearers have continued bone loss over the years. The biting force on the gum tissue irritates the bone and it melts away with a decrease in volume and density. Carlsson’s 1967 study showed a dramatic bone loss {{during the first year}} after a <b>tooth</b> <b>extraction</b> which continues over the years, even without a denture or partial on it.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this {{prospective}} study was to show and analyze the bleeding complications after <b>teeth</b> <b>extraction</b> under therapy with 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and to compare them to bleeding complications after <b>teeth</b> <b>extraction</b> in patients with a healthy blood profile. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 65 patients under medication with 100 mg ASA and in 252 healthy patients, 151 / 543 teeth were extracted and the bleeding complications monitored. RESULTS: The postoperative bleeding frequency was 1. 54 % in the ASA 100 group and 1. 59 % in the healthy control group without any medication. No serious or uncontrollable postoperative bleedings arose in either group. All bleedings could be easily handled. No obvious difference concerning the bleeding frequency {{between the two groups}} was observed. The small number of bleeding events and the complexity of affecting parameters did not permit statistical tests. CONCLUSION: It is not necessary to interrupt the medication of 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid given to prevent thromboembolism before <b>tooth</b> <b>extractions...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} {{could be a}} {{determinant}} risk factor {{in the frequency of}} Alveolar Osteitis.

It is recommended that elective surgeries be performed during the menstrual period in both oral contraceptives users and non users to eliminate the effect of cycle-related hormonal changes on the development of Alveolar Osteitis.|$|E
25|$|Filming for Harlow's final film Saratoga, co-starring Clark Gable, was {{scheduled}} to begin in March 1937. However, production was delayed when she developed septicemia {{and had to be}} hospitalized after a multiple wisdom <b>tooth</b> <b>extraction.</b> After she recovered, shooting began on April 22. On May 20, 1937, while shooting Saratoga, Harlow began to complain of illness. Her symptoms—fatigue, nausea, water weight and abdominal pain—did not seem very serious to her doctor, who believed she was suffering from cholecystitis and influenza. However, he was apparently unaware that Harlow had been ill during the previous year with a severe sunburn and influenza. Her friend and co-star Myrna Loy noticed Harlow's grey pallor, fatigue, and weight gain.|$|E

500|$|Common causes include {{inflammation}} of the pulp, usually in response to tooth decay, dental trauma, or other factors, dentin hypersensitivity (short, sharp pain, usually associated with exposed root surfaces), apical periodontitis ({{inflammation of}} the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone around the root apex), dental abscesses (localized collections of pus, such as apical abscess, pericoronal abscess, and periodontal abscess), alveolar osteitis ("dry socket", a possible complication of <b>tooth</b> <b>extraction,</b> with loss of the blood clot and exposure of bone), acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (a gum infection, also called [...] "trenchmouth"), temporomandibular disorder and others.|$|E
500|$|According to Taraborrelli, Chandler {{was forced}} to admit the {{controversial}} sedative sodium amytal was used when he extracted a tooth from Jordan in early August. On May 3, 1994, KCBS-TV news reported that Chandler claimed the drug was used for <b>tooth</b> <b>extraction</b> and that the allegations came out while Jordan was {{under the influence of}} the drug. Mark Torbiner, the dental anesthesiologist who administered the drug, told GQ if sodium amytal was used, [...] "it was for dental purposes." [...] Sodium amytal is a barbiturate that puts people in a hypnotic state when injected intravenously. Studies done in 1952 debunked the drug as a truth serum and demonstrated it enabled false memories to be easily implanted.|$|E
500|$|Success {{or failure}} of {{implants}} depends {{on the health of}} the person receiving the treatment, drugs which affect the chances of osseointegration, and the health of the tissues in the mouth. The amount of stress that will be put on the implant and fixture during normal function is also evaluated. Planning the position and number of implants is key to the long-term health of the prosthetic since biomechanical forces created during chewing can be significant. The position of implants is determined by the position and angle of adjacent teeth, by lab simulations or by using computed tomography with CAD/CAM simulations and surgical guides called stents. The prerequisites for long-term success of osseointegrated dental implants are healthy bone and gingiva. Since both can atrophy after <b>tooth</b> <b>extraction,</b> pre-prosthetic procedures such as sinus lifts or gingival grafts are sometimes [...] required to recreate ideal bone and gingiva.|$|E

500|$|In the Elizabethan era, {{toothache}} was an ailment {{associated with}} lovers, as in Massinger and Fletcher's play The False One. Toothache also {{appears in a}} number of William Shakespeare's plays, such as Othello and Cymbeline. In Much Ado About Nothing, Act III scene 2, when asked by his companions why he is feeling sad, a character replies that he has toothache so as not to admit the truth that he is in love. There is reference to [...] "toothworm" [...] as the cause of toothache and to <b>tooth</b> <b>extraction</b> as a cure ("draw it"). In Act V, scene 1, another character remarks: [...] "For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently." [...] In modern parlance, this translates to the observation that philosophers are still human and feel pain, even though they claim they have transcended human suffering and misfortune. In effect, the character is rebuking his friend for trying to make him feel better with philosophical platitudes.|$|E
500|$|In pulpitis, an {{important}} distinction in regard to treatment is whether the inflammation is reversible or irreversible. Treatment of reversible pulpitis is by removing or correcting the causative factor. Usually, the decay is removed, and a sedative dressing is used to encourage the pulp {{to return to a}} state of health, either as a base underneath a permanent filling or as a temporary filling intended to last for a period while the tooth is observed to see if pulpitis resolves. Irreversible pulpitis and its sequalae pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis require treatment with root canal therapy or <b>tooth</b> <b>extraction,</b> as the pulp acts as a nidus of infection, which will lead to a chronic infection if not removed. [...] Generally, there is no difference in outcomes between whether the root canal treatment is completed in one or multiple appointments. The field of regenerative endodontics is now developing ways to clean the pulp chamber and regenerate the soft and hard tissues to either regrow or simulate pulp structure. This has proved especially helpful in children where the tooth root has not yet finished developing and root canal treatments have lower success rates.|$|E
500|$|Antibiotics {{tend to be}} {{extensively}} {{used for}} emergency dental problems. As samples for microbiologic culture and sensitivity are hardly ever carried out in general dental practice, broad-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin are typically used for a short course of about three to seven days. Antibiotics {{are seen as a}} [...] "quick fix" [...] by both dentists, who generally only have a very short time to manage dental emergencies, and by patients, who tend to want to avoid treatments (such as <b>tooth</b> <b>extraction)</b> which are perceived negatively. However, antibiotics typically only temporarily suppress an infection, and the need for definitive treatment is only postponed for an unpredictable length of time. An estimated 10% of all antibiotic prescriptions are made by dentists, a major factor in antibiotic resistance. They are often used inappropriately, in conditions for which they are ineffective, or their risks outweigh the benefits, such as irreversible pulpitis, apical abscess, dry socket, or mild pericoronitis. However, the reality is that antibiotics are rarely needed, and they should be used restrictively in dentistry. Local measures such as incision and drainage, and removal of the cause of the infection (such as a necrotic tooth pulp) have a greater therapeutic benefit and are much more important. If abscess drainage has been achieved, antibiotics are not usually necessary.|$|E
