5000|$|After 1890, {{the system}} of Jim Crow, disenfranchisement, and second class {{citizenship}} degraded the citizenship rights of African Americans, especially in the South. It was the nadir of American race relations. There were three main aspects: racial segregation - upheld by the United States Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 -, legally mandated by southern governments—voter suppression or disfranchisement in the southern states, and private acts of violence and mass racial violence aimed at African Americans, unhindered or encouraged by government authorities. Although racial discrimination was present nationwide, the combination of law, public and private acts of discrimination, marginal economic opportunity, and violence directed toward African Americans in the southern states became known as Jim Crow.Noted strategies employed prior to 1955 included litigation and lobbying attempts by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). These efforts were {{a hallmark of the}} early American Civil Rights Movement from 1896 to 1954.However, by 1955, blacks became frustrated by gradual approaches to implement desegregation by federal and state governments and the [...] "massive resistance" [...] by whites. The black leadership adopted a combined strategy of direct action with nonviolence, sometimes resulting in nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience. Some of the acts of nonviolence and civil disobedience produced crisis situations between practitioners and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often acted with an immediate response to end <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>situations</b> - sometimes in the practitioners' favor. Some of the different forms of protests and/or civil disobedience employed included boycotts, as successfully practiced by the Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955-1956) in Alabama which gave the movement one of its more famous icons in Rosa Parks; [...] "sit-ins", as demonstrated by two influential events, the Greensboro sit-in (1960) in North Carolina and the Nashville sit-ins in Nashville, Tennessee; the influential 1963 Birmingham Children's Crusade, in which children were set upon by the local authorities with fire hoses and attack dogs, and longer marches, as exhibited by the Selma to Montgomery marches (1965) in Alabama which at first was resisted and attacked by the state and local authorities, and resulted in the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The evidence of changing attitudes could also be seen around the country, where small businesses sprang up supporting the Civil Rights Movement, such as New Jersey's Everybody's Luncheonette.|$|E

This {{thesis is}} focused on the issue of municipalities and their requiring material resources in the state property in solving crisis situations. The aim is to assess the municipality possibilities of using the material resources in the state property in crisis situations. In accordance with the assignment this work focuses on the principles of using material resources, comprising movable and immovable assets in state ownership, local government units, physical and legal persons, which can be used during solving <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>situations.</b> In the theoretical part the legislation of the Czech Republic concerning the use of material resources is described. The following chapter is devoted to information systems, which are used in requesting material resources in the state property. The second part of this thesis is based on a questionnaire sent out to mayors of municipalities in the South Bohemia region. The questionnaire contained thirteen questions. The questions were focused on the possibility of optimization of allocating material resources to civil protection during the solution of <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>situations.</b> The research question was: What is the awareness regarding the use of material resources owned by the state in solving <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>situations</b> in the selected municipalities? The questionnaire was sent to all municipalities in the South Bohemia region. Only 9 % of questionnaires were returned. Each question was processed and evaluated separately using a chart.

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} the key concepts {{and principles of}} the ethics of responsibility by H.

It is emphasized that in the conditions of deployment of postnational wars the principle of responsibility as a new categorical imperative has no alternatives and must become the basis of military practices and professional military ethics. Particular attention is paid to the methodological value of "heuristics of fear", that in the realities of the crisis societies discloses its not only an ontological and metaphysical meaning, but also a practical one. The crisis of modern Ukrainian society is mostly the crisis of responsibility. The complexity of the social and cultural situation in Ukraine requires the awareness of how unique and vulnerable the human nature is, the awareness of sociality to the mighty weapon and high technologies, the price of numerous "trials and errors" considering the possible irreversibility of the processes.

40|$|Abstract- The {{empowerment}} of women {{is crucial to the}} process of development of any community. Though women constitute almost half of our population and {{play a vital role in}} every sphere of life, their importance is not properly recognized by the society. They are generally suppressed and enjoy limited access to different fields of life, such as, education, society, culture, politics, business and so on. But a nation can not achieve all round development if women are not given equal opportunity of development with their male counterparts. A society moves when women move. Thus, the social status of women is a reliable indicator to assess the development of the society. It can be said that status of women is intimately connected with their economic position, which in turn depends on opportunities to participate in economic activities. SHGs provide women an avenue to participate in economic activities. It gives women an easy access to credit. The members of SHG meet regularly and save an amount of money in a joint account of the group which can be used as a revolving fund to provide credit for the consumption and production purposes. Sometimes, Bank also gives loans with minimum interest to these groups and as a result the SHG members can take money from that Bank loan at very low interest rate which in turn helps women to establish microenterprises and meet <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>situations.</b> The present paper aims to study the relationship between micro enterprise and women empowerment in Badarpur Development Block of Karimganj District...|$|E

The defining characteristic here is not quantitative but qualitative indicators that reflect the availability of financial resources of the business entities. To solve this problem, {{the relations between the}} main characteristics of the financial resources of the entity and its financial condition indicators as criteria for financial security were investigated. It was found that the value of financial resources and their structure do not have explicit dependence. Under the present circumstances, regardless of the existing capital structure, a business entity is unable to attract additional financial resources, despite their cost, and vice versa – opportunity to borrow on the capital market new resources at market value does not depend on the value of the shoulder leverage of the business unit. The limiting factors here are the imperfection of the home competitive environment and the psychological motives of the market participants. There is also a conflict situation when due to the reduction of the profitability, the business entities tend to borrow at higher interest rates. The reason for this is primarily in the needs of the production sector, namely the need for ongoing business proper funding, especially in <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>situations</b> that affects the financial and industrial status. Ensuring an adequate logistics of the business entity (the degree of amortization of the equipment) requires an appropriate level of funding, but does not affect its structure.
