25|$|I cannot {{forget that}} ever since I {{was a child}} Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, and {{the person in the}} world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (who have known him for more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character. I think they have all behaved very ill to me, and for most of them, who certainly owe much more <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> I do to them, I feel nothing but contempt, and do not trouble myself about them; but Fitzwilliam is an exception indeed.|$|E

500|$|Steiger was so {{devoted to}} his craft that during the 1970s he turned to many foreign productions, {{especially}} in Italy, to obtain the sort of roles he desired, but often clashed with directors over his method acting techniques. In {{one of his last}} interviews, Steiger said: [...] "What is the greatest thing an artist in any profession can give to a person?—that would be a constructive, warm memory. Because that gets into your brain and therefore into your life, so to speak.

Szigeti writes: [...] "... the impossibility of communicating by phone or wire with my wife--whose condition I pictured with the somewhat lurid pessimism usual to young prospective fathers--was certainly a greater torment <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> all the other discomforts put together".|$|E

[...] Coxon agreed, and felt [...] "Damon's songs were revealing more <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> to him" [...] and {{said that when he}} heard some of his home demos he realised [...] "he'd obviously gone off his head a bit more". The album features the first song to appear on a studio album in which Coxon not only wrote the lyrics, but also sang lead vocal—"You're So Great".|$|E

500|$|Anne's father {{continued}} his diplomatic career under Henry VIII. In Europe, Thomas Boleyn's charm won many admirers, including Margaret of Austria, daughter of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor.

Ordinarily, a girl had to be twelve years old to have such an honour, but Anne may have been younger, as the Archduchess affectionately referred to her as [...] "la petite Boulin [...] ". Anne made a good impression in the Netherlands with her manners and studiousness, Margaret reported that she was well spoken and pleasant for her young age. and told Sir Thomas Boleyn that his daughter was [...] "so presentable and so pleasant, considering her youthful age, that I am more beholden to you for sending her <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>than</b> you to me" [...] (E.W. Ives, op.cit.). Anne stayed with Margaret from spring 1513 until her father arranged for her to attend Henry VIII's sister Mary, who was about to marry Louis XII of France in October 1514.|$|E

Of course, that depends on their expertise. As an independent producer, I {{have to be a}} type of skilled laborer. There were many times that I had to make a film quickly. At those times, I kept entertainment-value in mind. Not once have I made a film for the sake of making the film itself. My taste is in looking through the camera. Filming happens to correspond with that taste. Art films are what Yu Hyun-mok makes. That's because director Yu wants to make art films. I just make films by following my heart, so the analysis I leave to all of you." [...] Kim Ki-youngAlthough a critically acclaimed, financially successful independent filmmaker, Kim was not immune from governmental pressure. He filmed Ban Geum-ryeon in 1975, but it was banned at the time, and not released until 1981, with 40 minutes of footage censored. The government also coerced Kim into making an anti-Communist propaganda film. The resulting film, Love of Blood Relations (1976), transcended the bounds of propaganda by portraying the communist agent as one of Kim's typical femme fatale characters. Kim later commented, [...] "North or south, capitalist or communist, ideology is far less interesting <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> the things that divide the sexes." ...|$|E

[...] In a review of the season finale, Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad declared her disappointment in the conclusion of Keamy's arc, stating that [...] "it's always a shame when the hot guys die, [...] Kevin Durand did an amazing job with the character … he'll be missed." [...] In a later article titled [...] "Lost Season Four Highlights", Martell noted Durand's [...] "strong performance" [...] that was [...] "particularly fun to watch" [...] and wrote that [...] "we [...] all know that Widmore's the big bad, but Keamy became the face of evil on the island in his stead." ...|$|E

After {{he dropped out of}} Chalmers, his parents refused to support him, and as a result he funded his early videos by selling prints of his Photoshop art, as well as working at a hot dog stand. On having to work at the stand, PewDiePie stated, [...] "the fact that I could make videos was so much more important <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> [...] I had to spend a few hours a day doing a job that wasn’t that prestigious." [...] Five years later, PewDiePie recalled, [...] "I knew people were big at other types of videos, but there was no one big in gaming, and I didn’t know you could make money out of it. It was never like a career that I could just quit college to pursue. It was just something I loved to do. And here we are five years later and it’s exploded." [...] By December 2011, PewDiePie's channel had around 60,000 subscribers. Around the time his channel earned 700,000 subscribers, PewDiePie spoke at Nonick Conference 2012. On 11 July 2012, the channel reached 1 million subscribers, and it reached 2 million subscribers in September. In October, OpenSlate ranked the PewDiePie channel as the #1 YouTube channel.
