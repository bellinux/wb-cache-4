40|$|Disease mapping {{studies have}} {{experienced}} an enormous {{development in the}} last twenty years. Both an Empirical Bayes (EB) and a Fully Bayes (FB) approach {{have been used for}} smoothing purposes. However, an excess of smoothing might hinder the detection of true high-risk areas. Identifying these extreme regions minimizing the misclassification of background or normal areas, and then, avoiding false alarms is crucial in epidemiology. Bayesian decision rules, based on the posterior distribution of <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> <b>risks,</b> have been investigated for this task, but no similar studies have been conducted under the EB approach. Within this framework, second order correct estimators of the MSE of the log-relative risk predictor can be used to build appropriate confidence intervals for <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> <b>risks.</b> Their ability to detect high-risk areas is investigated through a simulation study using the geographical structure of the well-known Scottish lip cancer data. Bayesian credibility intervals and decision rules, based on the posterior distribution of <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> <b>risks,</b> are also investigated to check if any of the approaches outperforms the others when classifying high-risk regions. The conclusion is that Bayesian decision rules, exploiting the posterior distribution of <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> <b>risks,</b> are more powerful to detect high-risk areas than EB confidence intervals, but no general rules can be defined as a global criterion to be routinely applied in every real setting. ...|$|R

Serotonin syndrome {{has been reported in}} patients of all ages, including the elderly, children, and even newborn infants due to in utero exposure. The serotonergic toxicity of SSRIs increases with dose, but even in over-dose it is insufficient to cause fatalities from serotonin syndrome in healthy adults. Elevations of central nervous system serotonin will typically only reach potentially fatal levels when drugs with different mechanisms of action are mixed together.

40|$|AbstractUsing the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, {{patient and}} non-patient version (SCID-P/NP), this study {{investigated}} 351 patients with schizophrenia, 122 with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and 238 unrelated healthy volunteers in a Chinese Han population. <b>The</b> <b>relative</b> <b>risks</b> posed by advanced paternal age for schizophrenia and OCD in offspring were computed under logistic regression analyses and adjusted for the participant's sex, age and co-parent age at birth. Compared to the offspring with paternal age of 25 – 29 years old, <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> <b>risks</b> rose from 2. 660 to 10. 183 in the paternal age range of 30 – 34 and ≥ 35. <b>The</b> <b>relative</b> <b>risks</b> for OCD increased from 2. 225 to 5. 413 in 30 – 34 and ≥ 35. For offspring with paternal age of < 25, the odds ratios of developing schizophrenia and OCD were 0. 628 and 0. 289 respectively, whereas an association between increased maternal age and risk for schizophrenia/OCD was not seen. Interaction analysis showed an interaction effect between paternal age and maternal age at birth. Such a tendency of risk affected by parental age for schizophrenia and OCD existed after splitting out the data of early onset patients. Sex-specific analyses found that <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> <b>risks</b> for schizophrenia with paternal age of 30 – 34 and ≥ 35 in male offspring were 2. 407 and 10. 893, and in female offspring were 3. 080 and 9. 659. <b>The</b> <b>relative</b> <b>risks</b> for OCD with paternal age of 30 – 34 and ≥ 35 in male offspring were 3. 493 and 7. 373, and in female offspring 2. 005 and 4. 404. The mean paternal age of schizophrenia/OCD patients born before the early 1980 s was much {{greater than that of}} patients who were born after then. The findings illustrated that advanced paternal age is associated with increased risk for both schizophrenia and OCD in a Chinese Han population, prominently when paternal age is over 35. Biological and non-biological mechanisms may both be involved in the effects of advanced paternal age on schizophrenia and OCD...|$|R

25|$|Studies {{have looked}} into the risk factors that {{are more prone to}} Japanese Americans, {{specifically}} in hundreds of family generations of Nisei (The generation of people born in North America, Latin America, Hawaii, or any country outside Japan either to at least one Issei or one non-immigrant Japanese parent) second-generation pro-bands (A person serving as the starting point for the genetic study of a family, used in medicine and psychiatry). The risk factors for genetic diseases in Japanese Americans include coronary heart disease and diabetes. One study, called the Japanese American Community Diabetes Study that started in 1994 and went through 2003, involved the pro-bands taking part to test whether the increased risk of diabetes among Japanese Americans is due to the effects of Japanese Americans having a more westernized lifestyle due to the many differences between the United States of America and Japan. One of the main goals {{of the study was to}} create an archive of DNA samples which could be used to identify which diseases are more susceptible in Japanese Americans. Concerns with these studies of the risks of inherited diseases in Japanese Americans is that information pertaining to the genetic relationship may not be consistent with the reported biological family information given of Nisei second generation pro-bands. Also, research has been put on concerning apolipoprotein E genotypes; this polymorphism has three alleles (*e2, *e3, and *e4)and was determined from research because of its known association with increased cholesterol levels and risk of coronary heart disease in Japanese Americans. Specifically too, the apolipoprotein *e4 allele is linked to Alzheimer’s disease as well. Also, there is increased coronary heart disease in Japanese-American men with a mutation in the cholesterol ester transfer protein gene despite having increased levels of HDL. By definition, HDL are plasma high density lipoproteins that show a genetic relationship with coronary heart disease (CHD). The cholesterol ester transfer protein(CETP) helps the transfer of cholesterol esters from lipoproteins to other lipoproteins in the human body. It plays a fundamental role in the reverse transport of cholesterol to the liver, which is why a mutation in this can lead to coronary heart disease. Studies have shown that the CETP is linked to increased HDL levels. There is a very common pattern of two different cholesterol ester transfer protein gene mutations (D442G, 5.1%; intron 14G:A, 0.5%) found in about 3,469 Japanese American men. This was based off a program called the Honolulu Heart Program. The mutations correlated with decreased CETP levels (-35%) and increased HDL cholesterol levels (+10% for D442G). <b>The</b> <b>relative</b> <b>risk</b> of CHD was 1.43 in men with mutations (P<0.05), and after research found for CHD risk factors, <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> <b>risk</b> went up to 1.55 (P=0.02); after further adjustments for HDL levels, <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> <b>risk</b> went up again to 1.68 (P=0.008). Genetic CETP deficiency is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, which is due mainly to increased CHD risks in Japanese American men with the D442G mutation and lipoprotein cholesterol levels between 41 and 60nbsp&mg/dl. With research and investigations, the possibility of finding “bad genes” denounces the Japanese Americans and will be associated only with Japanese American ancestry, leading to other issues the Japanese Americans had to deal with in the past such as discrimination and prejudice.|$|E
25|$|Hormonal {{contraceptives}} {{may produce}} {{a slight increase}} in {{the risk of breast cancer}} diagnosis among current and recent users, but this appears to be a short-term effect. In 1996 the largest collaborative reanalysis of individual data on over 150,000 women in 54 studies of breast cancer found a relative risk (RR) of 1.24 of breast cancer diagnosis among current combined oral contraceptive pill users; 10 or more years after stopping, no difference was seen. Further, the cancers diagnosed in women who had ever used hormonal contraceptives were less advanced than those in nonusers, raising the possibility that the small excess among users was due to increased detection. <b>The</b> <b>relative</b> <b>risk</b> of breast cancer diagnosis associated with current and recent use of hormonal contraceptives did not appear to vary with family history of breast cancer.
