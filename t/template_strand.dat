5|$|Transcription {{produces}} a single-stranded RNA molecule known as messenger RNA, whose nucleotide sequence is complementary to the DNA {{from which it}} was transcribed. The mRNA acts as an intermediate between the DNA gene and its final protein product. The gene's DNA {{is used as a}} template to generate a complementary mRNA. The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the <b>template</b> <b>strand.</b> Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase, which reads the <b>template</b> <b>strand</b> in the 3' to 5'direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3'. To initiate transcription, the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene. Thus, a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region, either by tight binding by repressor molecules that physically block the polymerase, or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible.|$|E
5|$|In DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases {{make copies}} of DNA polynucleotide chains. To {{preserve}} biological information, {{it is essential that}} the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the <b>template</b> <b>strand.</b> Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is activated and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.|$|E
5|$|For most viruses with RNA genomes {{and some}} with {{single-stranded}} DNA genomes, the single strands {{are said to}} be either positive-sense (called the plus-strand) or negative-sense (called the minus-strand), depending on if they are complementary to the viral messenger RNA (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that the <b>template</b> <b>strand</b> for the viral mRNA is complementary to it (−), and the coding strand is a copy of it (+). However, several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are ambisense in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate. Examples include geminiviruses, which are ssDNA plant viruses and arenaviruses, which are ssRNA viruses of animals.|$|E
50|$|The {{output of}} BAIT shows the {{inheritance}} of parental <b>template</b> <b>strands.</b> Normally, two <b>template</b> <b>strands</b> are inherited for each chromosome, and any deviation from this number indicates {{an instance of}} aneuploidy.|$|R

25|$|Okazaki {{fragments}} are short, newly synthesized DNA fragments {{that are}} formed on the lagging <b>template</b> <b>strand</b> during DNA replication. They are complementary to the lagging <b>template</b> <b>strand,</b> together forming short double-stranded DNA sections. Okazaki fragments are between 1000 and 2000 nucleotides long in prokaryotes (e.g. Escherichia coli) and are roughly 100 to 200 nucleotides long in eukaryotes. They {{are separated by}} ~120-nucleotide RNA primers and are unligated until RNA primers are removed, followed by enzyme ligase connecting (ligating) an Okazaki fragment onto the (now continuous) newly synthesized complementary strand.|$|E
25|$|Once an RNA primer {{has been}} added by a primase to the 3' end of the leading strand, DNA {{synthesis}} {{will continue in a}} 3' to 5' direction with respect to the leading strand uninterrupted. DNA Polymerase ε will continuously add nucleotides to the <b>template</b> <b>strand</b> therefore making leading strand synthesis require only one primer and has uninterrupted DNA polymerase activity.|$|E
25|$|During DNA replication, the {{replisome}} will unwind {{the parental}} duplex DNA into a two single-stranded DNA template replication fork in a 5' to 3' direction. The leading strand is the <b>template</b> <b>strand</b> {{that is being}} replicated {{in the same direction}} as the movement of the replication fork. This allows the newly synthesized strand complementary to the original strand to be synthesized 5' to 3' {{in the same direction as}} the movement of the replication fork.|$|E

25|$|PCNA fully encircles the DNA <b>template</b> <b>strand</b> {{and must}} be loaded onto DNA at the {{replication}} fork. At the leading strand, loading of the PCNA is an infrequent process, because DNA replication on the leading strand is continuous until replication is terminated. However, at the lagging strand, DNA polymerase δ needs to be continually loaded {{at the start of}} each Okazaki fragment. This constant initiation of Okazaki fragment synthesis requires repeated PCNA loading for efficient DNA replication.|$|E
25|$|There is {{increasing}} {{evidence that the}} majority of spontaneously arising mutations are due to error-prone replication (translesion synthesis) past DNA damage in the <b>template</b> <b>strand.</b> Naturally occurring oxidative DNA damages arise at least 10,000 times per cell per day in humans and 50,000 times or more per cell per day in rats. In mice, the majority of mutations are caused by translesion synthesis. Likewise, in yeast, Kunz et al. found that more than 60% of the spontaneous single base pair substitutions and deletions were caused by translesion synthesis.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} approach, ion semiconductor sequencing, {{is based}} on standard DNA replication chemistry. This technology measures {{the release of a}} hydrogen ion each time a base is incorporated. A microwell containing template DNA is flooded with a single nucleotide, if the nucleotide is complementary to the <b>template</b> <b>strand</b> it will be incorporated and a hydrogen ion will be released. This release triggers an ISFET ion sensor. If a homopolymer is present in the template sequence multiple nucleotides will be incorporated in a single flood cycle, and the detected electrical signal will be proportionally higher.|$|E
2500|$|The {{replication}} fork is the junction between the newly separated <b>template</b> <b>strands,</b> {{known as the}} leading and lagging strands, and the double stranded DNA. Since duplex DNA is antiparallel, DNA replication occurs in opposite directions ...|$|R
40|$|Recombinant DNA {{molecules}} {{are often}} generated during the {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) when partially homologous templates are available [e. g., see Pääbo et al. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4718 - 4721]. It {{has been suggested that}} these recombinant molecules are a consequence of truncated extension products annealing to partially homologous templates on subsequent PCR cycles. However, we demonstrate here that recombinants can be generated during a single round of primer extension in the absence of subsequent heat denaturation, indicating that template-switching produces some of these recombinant molecules. Two types of template-switches were observed: (i) switches to pre-existing templates and (ii) switches to the complementary nascent strand. Recombination is reduced several fold when the complementary <b>template</b> <b>strands</b> are physically separated by attachment to streptavidin magnetic beads. This result supports the hypothesis that either the polymerase or {{at least one of the}} two extending <b>strands</b> switches <b>templates</b> during DNA synthesis and that interaction between the complementary <b>template</b> <b>strands</b> is necessary for efficient template-switching...|$|R
30|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} means for slowing strand reannealing, but {{almost all of}} these would generate new problems for either replication or ribozyme activity. For example, <b>template</b> <b>strands</b> {{with a high degree}} of secondary structure could fold more rapidly than reannealing, drastically slowing the rate of reannealing. However, chemical copying through such folded structures is likely to be much slower than on an open, unstructured template, so it is unclear that secondary structure would provide any net advantage.|$|R
25|$|After {{escaping}} the promoter and shedding {{most of the}} transcription factors for initiation, the polymerase acquires new factors for {{the next phase of}} transcription: elongation. Transcription elongation is a processive process. Double stranded DNA that enters {{from the front of the}} enzyme is unzipped to avail the <b>template</b> <b>strand</b> for RNA synthesis. For every DNA base pair separated by the advancing polymerase, one hybrid RNA:DNA base pair is immediately formed. DNA strands and nascent RNA chain exit from separate channels; the two DNA strands reunite at the trailing end of the transcription bubble while the single strand RNA emerges alone.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{replication}} is {{the action}} of DNA polymerases synthesizing a DNA strand complementary to the original <b>template</b> <b>strand.</b> To synthesize DNA, the double-stranded DNA is unwound by DNA helicases ahead of polymerases, forming a replication fork containing two single-stranded templates. Replication processes permit the copying of a single DNA double helix into two DNA helices, which are divided into the daughter cells at mitosis. The major enzymatic functions carried out at the replication fork are well conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, but the replication machinery in eukaryotic DNA replication is a much larger complex, coordinating many proteins {{at the site of}} replication, forming the replisome.|$|E
25|$|TFIIH {{enters the}} complex. TFIIH {{is a large}} protein complex that {{contains}} among others the CDK7/cyclin H kinase complex and a DNA helicase. TFIIH has three functions: It binds specifically to the <b>template</b> <b>strand</b> {{to ensure that the}} correct strand of DNA is transcribed and melts or unwinds the DNA (ATP-dependent) to separate the two strands using its helicase activity. It has a kinase activity that phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II at the amino acid serine. This switches the RNA polymerase to start producing RNA. Finally it is essential for Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) of damaged DNA. TFIIH and TFIIE strongly interact with one another. TFIIE affects TFIIH’s catalytic activity. Without TFIIE, TFIIH will not unwind the promoter.|$|E
50|$|Strand-seq (single strand sequencing) {{was first}} {{described}} in 2012 as {{a technique to}} isolate sequenced reads from parental <b>template</b> <b>strands</b> in single-cell DNA libraries. As a proof of concept study, the authors demonstrated the ability to acquire sequence information from the Watson and/or Crick chromosomal strands in an individual DNA library, depending on the mode of chromatid segregation; a typical DNA library will always contain DNA from both strands. The authors were specifically interested in showing the utility of strand-seq in detecting sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) at high-resolution. They successfully identified eight putative SCEs in the murine (mouse) embryonic stem (meS) cell line with resolution up to 23 bp. This methodology {{has also been shown}} to hold great utility in discerning patterns of non-random chromatid segregation, especially in stem cell lineages. Furthermore, SCEs have been implicated as diagnostic indicators of genome stress, information that has utility in cancer biology. Most research on this topic involves observing the assortment of chromosomal <b>template</b> <b>strands</b> through many cell development cycles and correlating non-random assortment with particular cell fates. Single-cell sequencing protocols were foundational in the development of this technique, but they differ in several aspects.|$|R
50|$|Mutations occur {{every time}} a cell divides. Certain {{long-lived}} cells (ex. stem cells) may be particularly affected by these mutations. The Immortal Strand Hypothesis proposes that these cells avoid mutation accumulation by consistently retaining parental template strands9. For this hypothesis to be true, sister chromatids from each and every chromosome must segregate in a non-random fashion. Additionally, one cell will retain the exact same set of <b>template</b> <b>strands</b> after each division, giving the rest to the other cell products of the division.|$|R
50|$|During DNA replication, DNA polymerases {{elongate}} new {{strands of}} DNA against complementary <b>template</b> <b>strands.</b> Most DNA polymerases comprise two different enzymatic domains: a polymerase and a proofreading exonuclease. The polymerase elongates the new strand in the 5' → 3' direction. The exonuclease removes erroneous nucleotides {{from the same}} strand in the 3’ → 5’ direction. This exonuclease activity is essential for a DNA polymerase's ability to proofread. Deletions inactivating or removing these nucleases increases rates of mutation and mortality in affected microbes and cancer in mice.|$|R
25|$|Once the {{initiation}} complex is formed and the cells {{pass into the}} S phase, the complex then becomes a replisome. The eukaryotic replisome complex is responsible for coordinating DNA replication. Replication on the leading and lagging strands is performed by DNA polymerase ε and DNA polymerase δ. Many replisome factors including Claspin, And1, replication factor C clamp loader and the fork protection complex are responsible for regulating polymerase functions and coordinating DNA synthesis with the unwinding of the <b>template</b> <b>strand</b> by Cdc45-Mcm-GINS complex. As the DNA is unwound the twist number decreases. To compensate for this the writhe number increases, introducing positive supercoils in the DNA. These supercoils would cause DNA replication to halt {{if they were not}} removed. Topoisomerases are responsible for removing these supercoils ahead of the replication fork.|$|E
25|$|A {{microsatellite}} is a {{tract of}} repetitive DNA in which certain DNA motifs (ranging in length from 1–6 or more base pairs) are repeated, typically 5–50 times. Microsatellites occur at thousands of locations within an organism's genome. They {{have a higher}} mutation rate than other areas of DNA DNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for reading DNA during replication, can slip while moving along the <b>template</b> <b>strand</b> and continue at the wrong nucleotide. DNA polymerase slippage {{is more likely to}} occur when a repetitive sequence (such as CGCGCG) is replicated. Because microsatellites consist of such repetitive sequences, DNA polymerase may make errors at a higher rate in these sequence regions. Several studies have found evidence that slippage is the cause of microsatellite mutations. Typically, slippage in each microsatellite occurs about once per 1,000 generations. Thus, slippage changes in repetitive DNA are three orders of magnitude more common than point mutations {{in other parts of the}} genome. Most slippage results in a change of just one repeat unit, and slippage rates vary for different allele lengths and repeat unit sizes, and within different species. If there is a large size difference between individual alleles, then there may be increased instability during recombination at meiosis.|$|E

All HiSeq sequencers features intuitive, touch-screen controls, and accompanying software with guided step-by-step workflow directions. In addition, real-time run statistics can be monitored locally or remotely. HiSeq systems utilize Illumina’s well-established sequencing by synthesis (SBS) method in which fluorescently labeled nucleotide bases are detected {{as they are}} incorporated into DNA <b>template</b> <b>strands.</b> All four reversible terminator-bound dNTPs are present in each sequencing cycle; this feature minimizes bias of incorporation and greatly reduces raw error rates.|$|R
500|$|During DNA replication, double-strand breaks can {{sometimes}} be encountered at replication forks as DNA helicase unzips the <b>template</b> <b>strand.</b> [...] These defects are repaired in the break-induced replication (BIR) pathway of homologous recombination. [...] The precise molecular mechanisms of the BIR pathway remain unclear. Three proposed mechanisms have strand invasion as an initial step, but they differ in how they model the migration of the D-loop and later phases of recombination.|$|E
500|$|Synthesis of RNA {{is usually}} catalyzed by an enzyme—RNA polymerase—using DNA as a template, {{a process known}} as {{transcription}}. Initiation of transcription begins with the binding of the enzyme to a promoter sequence in the DNA (usually found [...] "upstream" [...] of a gene). The DNA double helix is unwound by the helicase activity of the enzyme. The enzyme then progresses along the <b>template</b> <b>strand</b> in the 3’ to 5’ direction, synthesizing a complementary RNA molecule with elongation occurring in the 5’ to 3’ direction. The DNA sequence also dictates where termination of RNA synthesis will occur.|$|E
500|$|The growth, development, and {{reproduction}} of organisms relies on cell division; {{the process by}} which a single cell divides into two usually identical daughter cells. This requires first making a duplicate copy of every gene in the genome in a process called DNA replication. The copies are made by specialized enzymes known as DNA polymerases, which [...] "read" [...] one strand of the double-helical DNA, known as the <b>template</b> <b>strand,</b> and synthesize a new complementary strand. Because the DNA double helix is held together by base pairing, the sequence of one strand completely specifies the sequence of its complement; hence only one strand needs to be read by the enzyme to produce a faithful copy. The process of DNA replication is semiconservative; that is, the copy of the genome inherited by each daughter cell contains one original and one newly synthesized strand of DNA.|$|E

40|$|Genome {{duplication}} requires {{not only}} unwinding of the template {{but also the}} displacement of proteins bound to the template, a function performed by replicative helicases located at the fork. However, accessory helicases are also needed since the replicative helicase stalls occasionally at nucleoprotein complexes. In Escherichia coli, the primary and accessory helicases DnaB and Rep translocate along the lagging and leading <b>strand</b> <b>templates,</b> respectively, interact physically and also display cooperativity in the unwinding of model forked DNA substrates. We demonstrate here that this cooperativity is displayed only by Rep and not by other tested helicases. ssDNA must be exposed on the leading <b>strand</b> <b>template</b> to elicit this cooperativity, indicating that forks blocked at protein–DNA complexes contain ssDNA ahead of the leading strand polymerase. However, stable Rep–DnaB complexes can form on linear as well as branched DNA, indicating that Rep {{has the capacity to}} interact with ssDNA on either the leading or the lagging <b>strand</b> <b>template</b> at forks. Inhibition of Rep binding to the lagging <b>strand</b> <b>template</b> by competition with SSB might therefore be critical in targeting accessory helicases to the leading <b>strand</b> <b>template,</b> indicating an important role for replisome architecture in promoting accessory helicase function at blocked replisomes...|$|R
50|$|DNA is a duplex {{formed by}} two anti-parallel strands.
