50|$|Psychodrama {{has three}} {{important}} techniques: {{the technique of}} doubling, the technique of mirroring, and the technique of role reversal. Each technique represents different stages in Moreno's theory of the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infant: <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> identity (<b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> doubling), <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self (<b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> mirroring), and <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other (<b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> role reversal). Role reversal requires that one has learned to differentiate {{in the areas of}} time, place and person, and is capable of moving out of his own position into another's position to be able to enact that other role.|$|R
30|$|The {{conclusions}} {{drawn from}} <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> constant RMB shock are generally {{consistent with that}} from <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> continued RMB appreciation.

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the test {{is to ensure that}} the right to equal {{protection}} is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness. First, individuals in the same class must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily. Secondly, the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be arbitrary. Lastly, the basis of classification must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action. <b>The</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the rational nexus test directly address these forms of arbitrariness. As such, a law that satisfies all <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the test will be found to be valid and constitutional.|$|E

30|$|We {{have found}} the {{computational}} cost spent in <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> kNN search is much less than that in <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weighted interpolating. Moreover, {{with the increase of}} the size of testing data, the weight of the running time cost in <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> kNN significantly decreases; and it even reduces to about one percentage. This observation indicates that most overhead in both the naive version and the tiled version is spent in <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> weighted interpolating rather than the kNN search. Therefore, further optimizations may need to be employed to improve the efficiency of the weighted interpolating.|$|R

5|$|Because postmortem fetal {{extrusion}} is so rare, and occurs under highly idiosyncratic conditions {{regarding the}} individual and the ambient environment, this phenomenon has not been studied for possible applications to forensic investigation. Even if the study of postmortem fetal extrusion could lead to improved investigative methods, experimental research would be highly problematic. At present, forensic scientists have at their disposal an array of established techniques and procedures for a death investigation at <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> decomposition when postmortem fetal extrusion typically occurs.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine {{education}} {{was the product}} of an ancient Greek educational tradition that stretched back to the 5th century BC. It comprised a tripartite system of education that, taking shape during the Hellenistic era, was maintained, with inevitable changes, up until the fall of Constantinople. <b>The</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> education were the elementary school, where pupils ranged from six to ten years, secondary school, where pupils ranged from ten to sixteen, and higher education.|$|E
5|$|Complement, an {{important}} component for serology, was first isolated from {{the blood of the}} guinea pig. Guinea pigs have an unusual insulin mutation, and are a suitable species for the generation of anti-insulin antibodies. Present at a level 10 times that found in other mammals, the insulin in guinea pigs may be important in growth regulation, a role usually played by growth hormone. Additionally, guinea pigs have been identified as model organisms for the study of juvenile diabetes and, because of the frequency of pregnancy toxemia, of pre-eclampsia in human females. Their placental structure {{is similar to that of}} humans, and their gestation period can be divided into trimesters that resemble <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> fetal development in humans.|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} the periodization {{of the history}} of relations between the Soviet state and religious denominations. The author identified 11 <b>stages</b> in <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> these relations:: 1. 1917 - 1918 – a transitional <b>stage</b> that prepared <b>the</b> transition from old relations to new ones; 2. 1918 - 1929 – <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> development of new legislation on religious cults; 3. 1929 - 1934 – <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development of legislation on cults; 4. 1934 - 1938 – the period of persecution, “The Great Terror”; 5. 1938 - 1943 – <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> easing of pressure and uncertainty; 6. 1943 - 1948 – <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> prosperity of relations {{between the state and the}} church; 7. 1948 - 1954 – <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> cooling relations between the state and religious cults; 8. 1954 - 1958 – <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> deterioration of relations between the state and cults; 9. 1958 - 1965 – a new <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> persecution; 10. 1966 - 1987 – <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> coexistence or stagnation; 11. 1988 - 1991 – <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> normalization of relations between the state and religions. The periodization is based on two principles: the first - the institution of power, responsible for the implementation of the religious policy of the state; the second - the legislative acts relating to the relations of the state and the church, adopted in the relevant era. This allows, on the one hand, to trace the logical chain of events in terms of the evolution of relations between the Soviet state and religious cults, and on the other hand, relieves of the need to consider these relations in a purely denominational aspect. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{a group of}} 26 patients with ochronotic spondyloarthropathy who were on regular treatment and follow-up at a tertiary level hospital and proposes a simplified staging system for ochronotic spondyloarthropathy based on radiographic findings seen in the thoracolumbar spine. This proposed classification {{makes it easy to}} identify <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease and start the appropriate management at an early stage. Four progressive stages are described: an inflammatory <b>stage</b> (<b>stage</b> 1), <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> early discal calcification (<b>stage</b> 2), <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> fibrous ankylosis (<b>stage</b> 3), and <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> bony ankylosis (<b>stage</b> 4).

5|$|Friedrich was a {{prolific}} artist who {{produced more than}} 500 attributed works. In line with the Romantic ideals of his time, he intended his paintings to function as pure aesthetic statements, so he was cautious that the titles given to his work were not overly descriptive or evocative. It is likely that some of today's more literal titles, such as <b>The</b> <b>Stages</b> <b>of</b> Life, were not given by the artist himself, but were instead adopted {{during one of the}} revivals of interest in Friedrich. Complications arise when dating Friedrich's work, in part because he often did not directly name or date his canvases. He kept a carefully detailed notebook on his output, however, which has been used by scholars to tie paintings to their completion dates.|$|E
5|$|The Kiss is an oil {{painting}} on canvas {{completed by the}} Norwegian symbolist artist Edvard Munch in 1897. Part of his Frieze of Life, which depicts <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> a relationship between men and women, The Kiss is a realization of a motif with which he had experimented since 1888/89: a couple kissing, their faces fusing as one in a symbolic representation of their unity. Exhibited as early as 1903, this work is held at the Munch Museum in Oslo.|$|E
5|$|The World Before the Flood is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1828 and {{currently in the}} Southampton City Art Gallery. It depicts a scene from John Milton's Paradise Lost in which, among a series of visions of the future shown to Adam, he sees the world immediately before the Great Flood. The painting illustrates <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> courtship as described by Milton; {{a group of men}} select wives from a group of dancing women, drag their chosen woman from the group, and settle down to married life. Behind the courting group, an oncoming storm looms, a symbol of the destruction which the dancers and lovers are about to bring upon themselves.|$|E

5|$|The end-fire array trades a few {{decibels}} {{of output}} power for directionality, so it requires more enclosures {{for the same}} output power as a tight-packed, flat-fronted array of enclosures. Sixteen enclosures in four rows were used in 2007 at one of <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the Ultra Music Festival, to reduce low frequency interference to neighboring stages. Because of the physical size of the end-fire array, few concert venues are able to implement it. The output pattern suffers from comb-filtering off-axis, but can be further shaped by adjusting the frequency response of each row of subwoofers.|$|E

The Delta HF 4×4 also won two-thirds of all <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> that 1987 rally, just like the C4 did this time around. Lancia also won both the Group A and Group N categories in the race, while Citroën won the 4-wheel drive WRC category and came first in the 2-wheel drive Super 1600 category.|$|E
5|$|Before Donkey Kong Countrys production, Rare's Tim and Chris Stamper {{invested}} and programmed {{experiments with}} a Silicon Graphics Challenge workstation, with their initial focus centred on a boxing game. Although never reaching beyond <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> initial development, senior Nintendo staff who visited their Twycross studio {{were impressed with}} their progress after being shown a working demo. Genyo Takeda was dispatched to Japan to advise then-president of Nintendo Hiroshi Yamauchi on securing a deal with Rare. Following talks between Yamauchi and Rare staff, Nintendo acquired 49% of the company, which culminated {{in the production of}} a new title using Alias and SGI technology and the addition of Rare as a second-party developer. The Stampers expressed interest in making a game based on Donkey Kong and were given Nintendo's permission.|$|E
50|$|Thus, {{the widest}} {{view of history}} reveals three most {{important}} <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> development: Oriental imperial (<b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> oneness, of suppression of freedom), Greek social democracy (<b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> expansion, in which freedom was lost in unstable demagogy), and Christian constitutional monarchy (which represents the reintegration of freedom in constitutional government).|$|R

5|$|Further {{depictions of}} Mary {{are found in}} the church background. They include a statue of the Virgin and Child {{positioned}} between two lit candles in the choir screen behind the main figures, and to the right two angels stand in the choir singing her praises (perhaps singing the hymn inscribed on the frame). Above her is an annunciation relief, and in the recessed bay a relief depicting her coronation; the crucifixion is shown on the rood. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> Mary's life as mother of Jesus are depicted in the painting. A two-column prayer tablet – similar to the one depicted in Rogier van der Weyden's large Seven Sacraments Altarpiece (1445–50) – hangs on a pier to the left. It contains words alluding to and echoing the lines on the original frame. The windows of the clerestory overlook flying buttresses, and cobwebs are visible between the arches of the vault. Several different building phases {{can be seen in the}} arched gallery, while the choral balcony and transept are depicted in a more contemporary style than the nave.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} visual effects, the closing sequence required ADR due to the sound of rain on the original filming. The visual effects were the director Dan Zeff's idea, and the writers were pleased that they were within budget. They also serve to tie the final shot to the opening shot of the episode, as both feature a raven. Scenes that were cut down in the editing process included the initial meeting between the witchfinders—Warren and Clarke—and Sir Andrew Pike, and a private discussion between Warren and Clarke after {{the first day of the}} trial. The extended versions of the scenes featured an explanation about the Devil being found in everyday objects and a discussion about <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> torture respectively. Shearsmith expressed frustration that these extra scenes could not be included on the DVD release.|$|E
5|$|The Mycenaean economy, {{given its}} pre-monetary nature, {{was focused on}} the {{redistribution}} of goods, commodities and labor by a central administration. The preserved Linear B records in Pylos and Knossos indicate that the palaces were closely monitoring a variety of industries and commodities, the organization of land management and the rations given to the dependent personnel. The Mycenaean palaces maintained extensive control of the nondomestic areas of production through careful control and acquisition and distribution in the palace industries, and the tallying of produced goods. For instance, the Knossos tablets record c. 80,000-100,000 sheep grazing in central Crete, and the quantity of the expected wool from these sheep and their offspring, as well as how this wool was allocated. The archives of Pylos display a specialized workforce, where each worker belonged to a precise category and was assigned to a specific task in <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> production, notably in textiles.|$|E
