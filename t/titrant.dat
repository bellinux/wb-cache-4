25|$|The {{electrodes}} are {{immersed in}} the solution to be titrated and the potential difference between the electrodes is measured. Measured volumes of <b>titrant</b> are added, with thorough (magnetic) stirring, and the corresponding values of emf (electromotive force) or pH recorded. Small increments in volume should be added near the equivalence point which is found graphically by noting the burette reading corresponding to the maximum change of emf or pH per unit change of volume. When {{the slope of the}} curve is more gradual it is not always easy to locate the equivalent point by this method. However, if small increments (0.1nbsp&cm³ or less) of <b>titrant</b> are added near the end point of the titration and a curve of change of emf or pH per unit volume against volume of <b>titrant</b> is plotted, a differential curve is obtained in which the equivalence point is indicated by a peak.|$|E
25|$|Potassium {{permanganate}} {{can be used}} to quantitatively {{determine the}} total oxidisable organic material in an aqueous sample. The value determined is known as the permanganate value. In analytical chemistry, a standardized aqueous solution of KMnO4 is sometimes used as an oxidizing <b>titrant</b> for redox titrations (permanganometry). In a related way, it is used as a reagent to determine the Kappa number of wood pulp. For the standardization of KMnO4 solutions, reduction by oxalic acid is often used.|$|E
25|$|The {{concentration}} of butyllithium in commercially available solutions tends to decrease {{over time as}} the BuLi reacts with air. Subsequently, butyllithium is often titrated prior to use to ascertain its true concentration. The BuLi is added to a known amount of a weakly acidic compound, such as an alcohol. Because butyllithium is a strong base, it quickly and quantitatively reacts with weak acids to give the corresponding lithium salts and butane. An indicator, such as 1,10-phenanthroline or 2,2'-bipyridine, is commonly used to signal the endpoint of the titration. Both compounds form colored complexes with butyllithium once the <b>titrant</b> is consumed.|$|E

50|$|Besides organic synthesis, phosphazene bases {{are used}} as basic <b>titrants</b> in non-aqueous acid-base titration. Their {{advantages}} for this are: they are very strong bases in many solvents and their conjugate acids are inert and non-HBD cations.|$|R
25|$|The {{official}} {{technique to}} measure oil concentration in cutting fluid samples is manual titration: 100ml of the fluid under test is titrated with a 0.5M HCl solution to an endpoint of pH 4 and {{the volume of}} <b>titrant</b> used to reach the endpoint {{is used to calculate}} the oil concentration. This technique is accurate and not affected by fluid contamination, but needs to be performed by trained personnel in a laboratory environment. A hand-held refractometer is the industrial standard used to determine the mix ratio of water-soluble coolants that estimates oil concentration from the sample refractive index measured in the Brix scale. The refractometer allows for in situ measurements of oil concentration within industrial plants. However, contamination of the sample reduces the accuracy of the measure. Other techniques are used to measure the oil concentration in cutting fluids, such as measure of the fluid viscosity, density, and ultrasound speed. Other test equipment is used to determine such properties as acidity and conductivity.|$|E
2500|$|Solubility {{values of}} organic acids, bases, and ampholytes of {{pharmaceutical}} interest {{may be obtained}} by a process called [...] "Chasing equilibrium solubility". In this procedure, a quantity of substance is first dissolved at a pH where it exists predominantly in its ionized form and then a precipitate of the neutral (un-ionized) species is formed by changing the pH. Subsequently, {{the rate of change}} of pH due to precipitation or dissolution is monitored and strong acid and base <b>titrant</b> are added to adjust the pH to discover the equilibrium conditions when the two rates are equal. The advantage of this method is that it is relatively fast as the quantity of precipitate formed is quite small. However, the performance of the method may be affected by the formation supersaturated solutions.|$|E
50|$|The {{term has}} also two other, {{conflicting}} meanings. In titration, the titer is {{the ratio of}} actual to nominal concentration of a <b>titrant,</b> e.g. a titer of 0.5 would require 1/0.5 = 2 times more <b>titrant</b> than nominal. This is to compensate for possible degradation of the <b>titrant</b> solution. Second, in textile engineering, titer is a synonym for linear density.|$|E

This is important for the determination of the acid or base content of some polymers for which ~cresol is a good solvent. The study of acid-base coulometry in nr-cresol was started because of the several advantages offered by coulometry: greater sensitivity, no problems with unstable <b>titrants,</b> and no need for standardization of <b>titrants.</b> Preliminaryexperiments in which constant-current coulometric titrations were carried out in solutions of tctraethylammonium perchlorate in m-crcsol showed that theelectrochemicalgenerationofbase(base(,~z-cresolate) at platinum electrodes does occur with lOOo/o current efficiency.

50|$|The {{electrode}} potential {{may also be}} chosen such that the <b>titrant</b> is reduced, but the analyte is not. In this case, the presence of excess <b>titrant</b> is easily detected by the increase in current above background (charging) current.|$|E
50|$|After enough <b>titrant</b> {{has been}} added to react {{completely}} with the analyte, the excess <b>titrant</b> may itself be reduced at the working electrode. Since this is a different species with different diffusion characteristics (and different half-reaction), the slope of current versus added <b>titrant</b> will have a different slope after the equivalence point. This change in slope marks the equivalence point, in the same way that, for instance, the sudden change in pH marks the equivalence point in an acid-base titration.|$|E
50|$|Titration, {{also known}} as titrimetry, is a common {{laboratory}} method of quantitative chemical analysis {{that is used to}} determine the unknown concentration of an identified analyte. Since volume measurements {{play a key role in}} titration, it is {{also known as}} volumetric analysis. A reagent, called the <b>titrant</b> or titrator is prepared as a standard solution. A known concentration and volume of <b>titrant</b> reacts with a solution of analyte or titrand to determine concentration. The volume of <b>titrant</b> reacted is called titration volume.|$|E

40|$|Coulometric titrationsin non-aqueous {{solvents}} {{offer some}} distinct advantages over conventional titrations. First of all, {{it is possible}} to generate and use <b>titrants</b> which are unstable on storage. Moreover, the method is somewhat more sensitive: coulometric titrations can be carried out in the microequivalent range. There is no need for standardization of <b>titrants,</b> and the titration curves show better resolution because of the absence of dilution effects. Finally, coulometric titrations can easily be automated, as the parameters which control the titration are electrical. However, several difficulties are involved in coulometric titrations in non-aqueous solvents. High cell resistances necessitate the use of high voltage sources and even with these the currents that can be obtained are generally low. The separation of the anode and cathode compartment of the cell when non-aqueous solvents are used can also be a problem. For liquids with a high viscosity, sintered glass discs are adequate but with other solvents loss of current efficiency can occur. Ion-exchange membranes which are very satisfactory for this purpose when water is the solvent’, usually have too high resistances in organic media. Whe...|$|R

50|$|What {{happens if}} some other species which reacts with the analyte (the <b>titrant)</b> is added? (For instance, {{chromate}} ions {{can be added}} to oxidize lead ions.) After a small quantity of the <b>titrant</b> (chromate) is added, the concentration of the analyte (lead) has decreased due to the reaction with chromate. The current from the reduction of lead ion at the working electrode will decrease. The addition is repeated, and the current decreases again.

50|$|The heat of {{neutralization}} of a fully dissociated acid with a fully dissociated base {{is approximately}} -56kJ/mol. The reaction is thus strongly exothermic, and is an excellent basis {{for a wide range}} of analysis in industry. An advantage for the industrial analyst is that the use of stronger <b>titrants</b> (1 to 2 mol/L) permits a reduction in the amount of sample preparation, and samples can often be directly and accurately dispensed into the titration vessel prior to titration.|$|R
