40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} the gender of local policymakers on policy outcomes. Analyzing a rich dataset from Brazilian municipalities and using a regression discontinuity design, we find that municipalities ruled by female mayors have better health outcomes, receive more federal discretionary transfers, and have lower corruption. Additionally, male mayors hire more <b>temporary</b> <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> than their female counterparts when they are allowed to run for re-election, and when municipal elections are approaching. These findings suggest that male mayors may promote more political patronage than female mayors and that men and women may respond differently to local election incentives. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of women’s {{leadership}} on policy outcomes in close races utilizing a rich dataset on Brazilian municipalities. We provide evidence that cities with female mayors have better health outcomes (prenatal visits and percentage of premature births), are awarded more federal discretionary transfers, and {{are less likely to}} have administrative irregularities in public procurement practices. Despite these results, male mayors are 20 percentage points more likely to be re-elected than female mayors. We discuss several interpretations of our results, including the role of political patronage and re-election incentives. We find that men are more likely to hire <b>temporary</b> <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> during the electoral year compared to their female counterparts. This effect is driven by incumbents who are eligible for re-election...|$|R
40|$|We analyze close {{elections}} {{between male}} and female mayoral candidates in Brazilian municipalities to provide novel evidence on the role of women as policymakers. Using an objective measure of corruption based on random government audits, we find that female mayors are less likely to engage in corruption compared to male mayors. We also find that female mayors hire fewer <b>temporary</b> <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> than male mayors during the electoral year and tend to attract less campaign contributions when running for reelection. Moreover, our results show that female mayors have a lower reelection probability than male mayors. We interpret our findings as suggesting that male incumbents are {{more likely to engage in}} strategic behavior and this improves their electoral performance. Other explanations receive less support from the data...|$|R
25|$|In {{terms of}} social policy, the Curtin Government enacted {{a wide range of}} {{progressive}} social reforms during its time in office. Pensions were introduced for deserted wives and widows, while the establishment of the Women's Employment Board led to increased wages for some women during the war. Aboriginal Australians were provided with significantly increased entitlement to welfare benefits, while maternity allowances were extended. In addition, pensions for the elderly and infirm were increased, while reciprocal arrangements with New Zealand were introduced regarding old age and invalid pensions. In 1942, <b>temporary</b> <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> became eligible to apply to join the Commonwealth superannuation scheme if they had been employed for no less than five years and were certified as having indefinite future employment, while the Commonwealth Employees' Furlough Act of 1943 provided long service leave for all temporary Commonwealth employees. In 1943, the Universities Commission was established to exempt students from war service to undertake or continue university studies and to assist those students by exempting them from fees and, subject to a means test, by providing them with living allowances.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Reform offers {{economic}} {{gains for}} society at large, but can represent {{a threat to}} the interests of <b>public</b> <b>employees.</b> <b>Public</b> sector reform faces opposition from voters employed in public sector. Norwegian data allow for an analysis this interpretation. Survey data show that <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> prefer less reform {{than the rest of the}} population. The voting behavior of <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> is more sensitive to reform than is that of other voters (the swing voter hypothesis), and hence: shares of <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> in a local jurisdiction have a negative impact on the probability of reform. 1...|$|R

50|$|As <b>public</b> <b>employee</b> {{salary and}} benefit {{obligations}} increase over time, {{particularly with regard}} to pensions and <b>public</b> <b>employee</b> retiree healthcare, the impacts on the local government budget become more significant and can even lead to bankruptcy. Local politicians end up having to reduce public services and/or raise taxes or other revenues such as fees and charges. To the extent that taxes are raised, the tax proceeds will generally either directly or indirectly pay for <b>public</b> <b>employee</b> salary and benefit obligations. Research has shown that many local tax increases are concentrated in California communities that have the largest <b>public</b> <b>employee</b> pension problems.|$|R

40|$|Surveys are a {{commonly}} used means of measuring transparency levels, {{but they are}} potentially vulnerable to perceptual biases. This study sought to examine perceptual differences by the respondents’ identities as general citizens or <b>public</b> <b>employees,</b> and the possible negative perceptions that one group may have of the other concerning responses to a survey-based measure of transparency. The survey was designed {{on the basis of}} existing literature, suggesting that transparency has up to six facets. Two samples were taken: from citizens who visited district offices to file civil applications during the survey period; and from <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> involved in processing these applications. A total of 472 surveys were used for analysis: 233 citizens and 239 <b>public</b> <b>employees.</b> The results indicated that the two groups had different understandings of transparency. Data from <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> produced a three-factor solution, which was labeled as Efficiency, Reliability, and Access. For citizens, a two-factor solution was a better fit, with the factors being described as Accessibility (a wider notion than Access) and Utility. The findings suggest that <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> adopt a somewhat technical view of transparency, whereas citizens have more practical concerns about it. Only citizens’ unfavorable perception of <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> had a negative influence on the level of transparency. This study contributes to the understanding of how <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> and citizens have qualitatively different perceptions of transparency. Points for practitioners To assess progress in governmental transparency, we must measure it, and surveys offer an accessible and potentially cost-effective approach. However, the survey responses of citizens and <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> show that they understand transparency in qualitatively different ways, with citizens’ perceptions of transparency also influenced by their perceptions of <b>public</b> <b>employees.</b> If governments are to increase public trust in policymaking and administration, they must focus on improving transparency as it is understood by the public rather than how it is understood by public servants...|$|R
