5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{kilogram}} {{remained unchanged}} throughout the twentieth century, the 3rd CGPM in 1901 clarified that the kilogram was {{a unit of}} mass, not of weight. The original batch of 40 prototypes (adopted in 1889) were supplemented {{from time to time}} with further prototypes for use by new signatories to the Metre Convention.|$|E
5|$|An alloy of 90% {{platinum}} and 10% iridium {{was used}} in 1889 to construct the International Prototype Metre and kilogram mass, kept by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. The meter bar was replaced as <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fundamental unit of length in 1960 by {{a line in the}} atomic spectrum of krypton, but the kilogram prototype is still the international standard of mass.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the BIPM had custody of two artefacts – one to define length and the other to define mass. Other units of measure which did not rely on specific artefacts were controlled by other bodies. In the scientific world, quantum theory was in its infancy and Einstein had yet to publish his theories of relativity. By the end of the century, a coherent system of units was in place under the control of the bodies set up by the Convention du Mètre (Metre Convention), <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second relied on quantum theory, <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metre relied on the theory of relativity, and plans were being made to relegate the international prototype kilogram to the archives.|$|E

5|$|In a {{revision}} of basal Dinosauria, Padian and May (1993) discussed <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clade, and redefined it as the latest common ancestor of Triceratops and birds. They also discussed what this definition would do to the most basal taxa, such as Herrerasauridae, and Eoraptor. Padian and May considered that since both Herrerasauridae and Eoraptor lack many diagnostic features of Saurischia or Ornithischia, {{that they could not}} be considered inside Dinosauria.|$|E
5|$|In {{information}} theory, <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{amount of}} self-information and information entropy is often expressed with the binary logarithm, corresponding {{to making the}} bit the fundamental unit of information.

5|$|It is {{expected}} that <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kilogram and several other units will change on May 20, 2019, following a final vote by the CGPM in November 2018.

5|$|Rubidium and caesium {{are often}} used in atomic clocks. Caesium atomic clocks are {{extraordinarily}} accurate; if a clock had been made {{at the time of}} the dinosaurs, it would be off by less than four seconds (after 80 million years). For that reason, caesium atoms are used as <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{kilogram}} {{is undergoing}} a fundamental change—the current definition defines the kilogram as being {{the mass of the}} international prototype kilogram which is an artefact, not a constant of nature while the new definition relates it to the equivalent energy of a photon via the Planck constant.|$|E

5|$|A galactic bar {{also has}} the {{potential}} to affect the size of the galactic habitable zone. Galactic bars are thought to grow over time, eventually reaching the corotation radius of the galaxy and perturbing the orbits of the stars located there. High-metallicity stars like our Sun, for example, located at an intermediate location between the low-metallicity galactic halo and the high-radiation galactic center, may be scattered throughout the galaxy, affecting <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> galactic habitable zone.
