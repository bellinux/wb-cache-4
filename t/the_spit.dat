5|$|The Point {{was formed}} by {{longshore}} drift and this movement continues westward; <b>the</b> <b>spit</b> lengthened by 132.1m (433ft) between 1886 and 1925. At the western end, the shingle curves south towards the mainland. This feature has developed several times over the years, giving the impression from {{the air of a}} series of hooks along the south side of <b>the</b> <b>spit.</b> Salt marshes have formed between the shingle curves and in front of the coasts sheltered by <b>the</b> <b>spit,</b> and sand dunes have accumulated at the Point's western end. Some of the shorter side ridges meet the main ridge at a steep angle due to the southward movement of the latter. There is an area of reclaimed farmland, known as Blakeney Freshes, to the west of Cley Beach Road.|$|E
5|$|Realignment of the River Glaven {{means the}} ruins are {{now to the}} north of the river embankment, and {{essentially}} unprotected from coastal erosion, since the advancing shingle will no longer be swept away by the stream. The chapel will be buried by a ridge of shingle as <b>the</b> <b>spit</b> continues to move south, and then lost to the sea, perhaps within 20–30years.|$|E
5|$|The Black House, a local landmark, {{stands at}} the end of <b>the</b> <b>spit,</b> {{opposite}} Mudeford Quay, site of the Battle of Mudeford in 1784. Built in 1848, it was once a boat-builders' house, but is now rented out to holidaymakers. It has served a variety of functions over the years, and is commonly (but inaccurately) associated with the area's smuggling past.|$|E

5|$|The many {{visitors}} {{who come to}} birdwatch, sail or for other outdoor recreations {{are important to the}} local economy, but the land-based activities jeopardize nesting birds and fragile habitats, especially the dunes. Some access restrictions on humans and dogs help to reduce the adverse effects, and trips to see the seals are usually undertaken by boat. <b>The</b> <b>spit</b> is a dynamic structure, gradually moving towards the coast and extending to the west. Land is lost to the sea as <b>the</b> <b>spit</b> rolls forward. The River Glaven can become blocked by the advancing shingle and cause flooding of Cley village, Cley Marshes nature reserve, and the environmentally important reclaimed grazing pastures, so the river has to be realigned every few decades.|$|E
5|$|Jane Bulcock {{and her son}} John Bulcock, {{both from}} Newchurch in Pendle, were accused and found guilty of the murder by {{witchcraft}} of Jennet Deane. Both denied that they had attended the meeting at Malkin Tower, but Jennet Device identified Jane as having {{been one of those}} present, and John as having turned <b>the</b> <b>spit</b> to roast the stolen sheep, the centrepiece of the Good Friday meeting at the Demdike's home.|$|E
5|$|Landward {{movement}} of the shingle meant that the channel of the Glaven was becoming blocked increasingly often by 2004. This led to flooding of Cley village and the environmentally important Blakeney freshwater marshes. The Environment Agency considered several remedial options. It concluded that attempting {{to hold back the}} shingle or breaching <b>the</b> <b>spit</b> to create a new outlet for the Glaven would be expensive and probably ineffective, and doing nothing would be environmentally damaging. The Agency decided to create a new route for the river to the south of its original line, and work to realign a 550m (600yd) stretch of river 200m (220yd) further south was completed in 2007 {{at a cost of about}} £1.5million. The Glaven had previously been realigned from an earlier, more northerly, course in 1922. The ruins of Blakeney Chapel are now to the north of the river embankment, and essentially unprotected from coastal erosion, since the advancing shingle will no longer be swept away by the stream. The chapel will be buried by a ridge of shingle as <b>the</b> <b>spit</b> continues to move south, and then lost to the sea, perhaps within 20–30years.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>spit</b> {{is home to}} more 300 {{privately owned}} beach-huts, which {{are some of the}} UK's most expensive. In 2015 five of the huts were put on the market for a {{combined}} asking price of £1 million. On average the huts measure around five by three metres, have no running water, and the occupants may only stay overnight from March to October. Despite the relative lack of amenities, the area {{has become one of the}} UK's most desirable; huts are rented out for up to £600 a week.|$|E
5|$|Blakeney Point, {{like most}} of the {{northern}} part of the marshes in this area, is part of the parish of Cley next the Sea. The main spit runs roughly west to east, and joins the mainland at Cley Beach before continuing onwards as a coastal ridge to Weybourne. It is approximately 6.4km (4mi) long, and is composed of a shingle bank which in places is 20m (65ft) in width and up to 10m (33feet) high. It has been estimated that there are 2.3millionm3 (82millionft3) of shingle in <b>the</b> <b>spit,</b> 97per cent of which is derived from flint.|$|E
5|$|During the inter-war years Calshot {{was taken}} over by the Royal Air Force, {{becoming}} RAF Calshot. It was used as the School for Naval Co-operation and Aerial Navigation from 1918 onwards and began housing the Seaplane Training Squadron in 1931. The 1895 battery was demolished to create additional space for the growing station, and a narrow-gauge railway constructed along <b>the</b> <b>spit.</b> Parts of the castle moat were concreted over to provide parking for planes. Calshot twice hosted the Schneider Trophy air races over the Solent, the last two in the sequence of popular international events designed to encourage the development of new, high-speed technology. The Empire Air Day events were also held at Calshot, attracting 1,000 visitors in 1935.|$|E

5|$|Hurst Castle is an {{artillery}} fort established by Henry VIII on the Hurst Spit in Hampshire, England, between 1541 and 1544. It formed {{part of the}} King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the western entrance to the Solent waterway. The early castle had a central keep and three bastions, and in 1547 was equipped with 26 guns. It was expensive to operate due to its size, but it formed {{one of the most}} powerful forts along the coast. During the English Civil War of the 1640s, Hurst was held by Parliament and was used briefly to detain King Charles I before his execution in 1649. It continued in use during the 18th century but fell into disrepair, <b>the</b> <b>spit</b> being frequented by smugglers.|$|E
5|$|Keene came to Alaska for {{the first}} time in the early 1970s to attend a cousin's wedding. Attracted by the state's beauty, she {{returned}} for several visits before making the decision in 1977 to move there — alone. Her son Lonnie was deemed old enough to make his own decisions, and he chose to remain in Minnesota. Keene took a week to drive from Minnesota to Alaska in a secondhand motorhome, ending in Homer, where she parked the motorhome at the end of Homer Spit in the Homer Spit Campground, where it remained for many years. She took a job at a fish processing facility on <b>the</b> <b>Spit,</b> the Icicle Seafoods subsidiary Seward Fisheries, in the spring of 1977, where she later became a foreman.|$|E
5|$|The castle formed part of {{a network}} of defences around the {{entrance}} to the Solent during the First World War, and was re-armed again during the Second World War. The military decommissioned the fort in 1956 and it passed into the control of the Ministry of Works. In the 21st century, it is run jointly by English Heritage and the Friends of Hurst Castle as a tourist attraction, receiving around 40,000 visitors during 2015. Coastal erosion has become a growing problem despite government intervention to protecting <b>the</b> <b>spit.</b> Four lighthouses have been built at Hurst from the 18th century onwards, one of which, a high lighthouse first opened in 1867, remains in active service.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>spit</b> {{is moving}} towards the {{mainland}} at about 1m per year, {{and for the}} last two hundred years maps have been accurate enough for the encroachment of the sea to be quantified. Blakeney Chapel, just west of the reserve, was 400m (440yd) from the sea in 1817, but this had reduced to 195m (215yd) {{by the end of the}} twentieth century. The landward movement of the shingle also means that the channel of the River Glaven becomes blocked increasingly often, leading to flooding of the reserve and Cley village. The Environment Agency considered a number of remedial options to protect these vulnerable areas, and a new route for the river to the south of its original line was completed in 2007 at a cost of about £1.5million.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>spit</b> {{sheltered}} the Glaven ports, Blakeney, Cley-next-the-Sea and Wiveton, {{which were}} important medieval harbours. Blakeney sent ships to help Edward I's war efforts in 1301, {{and between the}} 14th and 16th centuries {{it was the only}} Norfolk port between King's Lynn and Great Yarmouth to have customs officials. Blakeney Church has a second tower at its east end, an unusual feature in a rural parish church. It has been suggested that it acted as a beacon for mariners, perhaps by aligning it with the taller west tower to guide ships into the navigable channel between the inlet's sandbanks; that this was not always successful is demonstrated by a number of wrecks in the haven, including a carvel-built wooden ship.|$|E
5|$|The two-storied north-west bastion {{protected}} the castle against attack along <b>the</b> <b>spit</b> from the mainland, and housed the castle's original portcullis {{as well as}} providing accommodation for the garrison. It had three levels of gun positions on its ground floor, first floor and roof, which were adapted in the 19th century to house heavier weapons and shelter riflemen. The bastion links to an external caponier, a covered walkway with rifle loops for close defence, built in 1852. The north-east and south-east bastions are only one storey tall, originally holding two levels of gun positions on the ground floor and roofs, again both adapted to support heavier guns in the 19th century.|$|E

5000|$|Biryuchyi Island (Бирючий Острів, [...] ) is a spit (former island) in {{the northwestern}} part of the Azov Sea, {{expanded}} southern part of <b>the</b> Fedotova <b>Spit.</b> Together with <b>the</b> narrow northern part of <b>the</b> Fedotova <b>Spit,</b> Biryuchyi Island forms the Utljuk Lyman separating it from the sea from the east. Until 1929, <b>the</b> current <b>Spit</b> was an island, separated from {{the northern part of}} <b>the</b> Fedotova <b>Spit</b> by a narrow strait.|$|R
5|$|With {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the {{government}} coastguard took control of the castle, using it as a base to combat smuggling, taking advantage of the water behind the Calshot Spit as a good location to position their waiting interception vessels. By the middle of the century, two officers and forty-two men were stationed there. By the 1850s, there was renewed military interest in the site, and several proposals were made to redevelop it to mount as many 32 artillery guns; the plans were not taken forward, and it was noted that the presence of the 16th-century stone keep would create dangerous splinters in the event of any enemy artillery fire landing there. In 1887, the Castle Yacht Club was established just beside the castle along <b>the</b> <b>spit.</b>|$|E
5|$|Half {{the area}} of the salt marshes that formed in the lee of Scolt Head Island has been {{reclaimed}} in the last 300 years, creating ecologically important, but very fragile, grazing marshes. Although Holkham is low-lying and can flood in severe weather conditions, it is protected by <b>the</b> <b>spit</b> that developed at the Holkham Gap in the 1990s and the dunes along the coast, which are increasingly being stabilised by vegetation. The Environment Agency's management plan until 2105 is to rely on the natural protection of the dunes, intervening only if work is necessary to maintain their effectiveness {{in the face of a}} potential sea level rise of 1.1m (3ft) by that date. The shingle that makes up Scolt Head Island is moving westwards and southwards at up to 3.5m (10ft) per year. This may affect the movement of sediment, and lead to some erosion of the dunes and beaches at Holkham, but should not destroy their effectiveness as a sea defence unless the island reattaches to the mainland at some date in the distant future.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{the owner}} of the Point, Augustus Cholmondeley Gough-Calthorpe, 6th Baron Calthorpe, leased the land to University College London (UCL), who also {{purchased}} the Old Lifeboat House at the end of <b>the</b> <b>spit.</b> When the baron died later that year, his heirs put Blakeney Point up for sale, raising the possibility of development. In 1912, a public appeal initiated by Charles Rothschild and organised by UCL Professor Francis Wall Oliver and Dr Sidney Long enabled the purchase of Blakeney Point from the Calthorpe estate, and the land was then donated to the National Trust. UCL established a research centre at the Old Lifeboat House in 1913, where Oliver and his college pioneered the scientific study of Blakeney Point. The building is still used by students, and also acts as an information centre. Despite formal protection, the tern colony was not fenced off until the 1960s.|$|E
