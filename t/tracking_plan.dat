40|$|TIGRAS is {{client-side}} software, {{which provides}} tracking-station equipment planning, allocation, and scheduling {{services to the}} DSMS (Deep Space Mission System). TIGRAS provides functions for schedulers to coordinate the DSN (Deep Space Network) antenna usage time and to resolve the resource usage conflicts among tracking passes, antenna calibrations, maintenance, and system testing activities. TIGRAS provides a fully integrated multi-pane graphical user interface for all scheduling operations. This is a great improvement over the legacy VAX VMS command line user interface. TIGRAS has the capability to handle all DSN resource scheduling aspects from long-range to real time. TIGRAS assists NASA mission operations for DSN tracking of station equipment resource request processes from long-range load forecasts (ten years or longer), to midrange, short-range, and real-time (less than one week) emergency <b>tracking</b> <b>plan</b> changes. TIGRAS can be operated by NASA mission operations worldwide to make schedule requests for the DSN station equipment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The main {{goals of}} using {{simulations}} and Virtual Environments for Training/Learning (VET/L) are to avoid risks and unwanted consequences, to reduce training costs, {{and to promote}} trial and error as an effective strategy for learning. Such environments should enable monitoring of the plans followed by learners, the errors they commit and the resulting risks, and show learners {{the impact of their}} decisions during the training process. In this paper, we present a research work that aims to develop a learner tracking system in a virtual environment equipped with an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), that we have called HERA (Helpful agent for safEty leaRning in virtuAl environment). This system is composed of different models representing the data sources, and other modules corresponding to the main processes charged with exchanging, analyzing, transforming, registering, and interpreting data. Thanks to the collaboration between these models and modules, HERA is able to determine learners ’ current tasks, the errors and risks produced, and to help them during and after learning. Our system allows learners to perform their tasks in front of a screen, and to see 1) the impact of their decisions by modifying the Virtual Environment, and 2) a textual feedback of their activities (tasks and errors) in a list form.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Real time {{adaptive}} radiotherapy that enables smaller irradiated volumes may reduce pulmonary toxicity. We {{report on the}} first patient treatment of electromagnetic-guided real time adaptive radiotherapy delivered with MLC tracking for lung stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy. Materials and methods A clinical trial was developed to investigate the safety and feasibility of MLC tracking in lung. The first patient was an 80 -year {{old man with a}} single left lower lobe lung metastasis to be treated with SABR to 48 Gy in 4 fractions. In–house software was integrated with a standard linear accelerator to adapt the treatment beam shape and position based on electromagnetic transponders implanted in the lung. MLC tracking plans were compared against standard ITV-based treatment planning. MLC <b>tracking</b> <b>plan</b> delivery was reconstructed in the patient to confirm safe delivery. Results Real time adaptive radiotherapy delivered with MLC tracking compared to standard ITV-based planning reduced the PTV by 41 % (18. 7 – 11 cm 3) and the mean lung dose by 30 % (202 – 140 cGy), V 20 by 35 % (2. 6 – 1. 5 %) and V 5 by 9 % (8. 9 – 8 %). Conclusion An emerging technology, MLC tracking, has been translated into the clinic and used to treat lung SABR patients for the first time. This milestone represents an important first step for clinical real-time adaptive radiotherapy that could reduce pulmonary toxicity in lung radiotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 64 - 66) The paper {{investigates the}} possibility of developing an automatic vehicle collision avoidance system for autos traveling on a freeway in dense fog. The collision avoidance system is comprised of two major components: 1. Speed Cruise Control, and 2. A Laser Tracker. With {{the use of the}} value of "driver selected speed" from the Speed Cruise Control, and range and range-rate data from the laser tracker, the system will automatically maintain a safe separation distance between following vehicles. First, a mathematical model was developed to describe the empirical observation that a form of ???wave phenomenon??? exists {{in a long line of}} vehicles traveling on a highway. The theory derived to analyze highway traffic movement was a car-following model based on modern mathematical techniques. A model for the collision avoidance system was then postulated using-the above-method. The necessary general requirements for the overall system, sensor, reflector, and tracking distance criteria were then determined. Then an examination of automatic versus the semiautomatic system was made. Based on the above requirements a general description of the vehicle collision avoidance system is presented along with a detailed discussion of the basic <b>tracking</b> <b>plan.</b> The reflector-sensor tracking problem is evaluated from which self test requirements are then determined. Next, a study was performed to determine if it was possible to propagate laser light through fog. The results of the study were: 1. Light is scattered at a constant value and is independent of wavelength until fog droplet radius equals the laser wavelength, and 2. The amount of scattering is negligible when the value of laser wavelength equals ten times the fog droplet radius. Based on a discussion of the results the conclusions are: 1. The system is not feasible with present technology, and 2. Fog consists of large spherical droplets which result in the scattering of light that is essentially independent of wavelength...|$|E
