40|$|Short over-all time delay, {{low time}} jitter, and {{excellent}} long-term reliability {{are among the}} desirable features designed into a pulse generator that produces a 2 -MW output pulse 30 nsec after {{the application of a}} 1 -V signal at its 50 -ohm input connector. The 10 -kV output pulse can be used to trigger simultaneously several spark gaps of the type used in spark-chamber pulse modulators. The 10 {sup 8 } power gain of the spark-gap-trigger amplifier is achieved by four stages of amplification packaged in a 5 - 1 / 4 inch rack-mount chassis that operates directly from a 117 -V line. The individual stages, each selected to give minimum time delay for a given power gain at their respective power levels are: avalanche transistors, planar triode, grounded-grid planar triode, and a triggered-spark gap. The techniques used for the last stage, a spark gap triggered by a corona light, are of particular interest since the same techniques are applicable to obtaining short time delays and long-term reliability from the larger spark gaps that the amplifier was designed to trigger. During 10 months of operation, there have been no failures and no adjustments necessary in any of the seven <b>spark-gap</b> <b>trigger</b> amplifiers used in various spark-chamber experiments at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory of the University of California (UCLRL) in Berkeley...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we discuss a 10 kW {{high-voltage}} pulse generator for producing corona-induced plasma. The generator mainly consists of a three-step resonant charging circuit switched by thyristors, a transmission line transformer, and a <b>triggered</b> <b>spark-gap</b> switch. Voltage pulses of 30 – 100 kV with a rise time of about 20 ns, a pulse duration of 50 – 250 ns, pulse repetition rate of 1 – 900 pulses per second, energy of up to 12 J/pulse, and an average power of up to 10 kW have been achieved with a total energy transfer efficiency of about 80 %– 90 %. At each frequency, the deviation of the energy per pulse is around 1. 0 %. Moreover, the generator has been tested for more than 100 h for both industrial demonstrations and laboratory investigations at an average output power of 1 – 10 kW...|$|E
40|$|The high {{dielectric}} strength of sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) {{when compared with}} other gases, coupled with safety benefits such as non-flammability and non-toxicity, has seen {{the widespread use of}} SF 6 for the insulation of switching components. However, SF 6 is now widely recognised as a highly damaging greenhouse gas, and investigations of the switching properties of alternative gases to replace SF 6 within the bounds of existing system topologies are required. In the present paper, a comparative study has been carried out on a <b>triggered</b> <b>spark-gap</b> of type presently deployed in industrial pulsed-power machines, to determine the suitability of nitrogen (N 2) to replace SF 6 as the switching medium, without compromising on functionality. Experiments were performed with fast-rising trigger pulses to minimise the delay time to breakdown and jitter, and three distinct operational regimes have been identified for both gases as the pressure inside the switch is increased. The static breakdown characteristics and upper pressure boundaries of operation have been determined for both gases at a range of dc charging voltages. Measurements of the time to breakdown have shown jitters as low as 1. 3 ns when operating in N 2, highlighting the potential of N 2 to replace SF 6 without the need for re-design or replacement of the presently used switch...|$|E
