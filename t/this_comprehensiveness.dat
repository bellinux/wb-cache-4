40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comprehensive}} outline {{of the development of}} an element of black culture, the blues, analyzed through the use of concepts created for this endeavor. The conceptual framework referred to above for the anthropology of the blues is derived from a synthesis of elements drawn from previous works on the blues with the author’s own. When applies {{to the study of the}} blues, this new conceptual orientation renders a history of the blues in skeletal form which is more comprehensive than those of other scholars working in this field. <b>This</b> <b>comprehensiveness</b> is manifested in several ways. Firstly the resultant formulation elucidates the general patterns discernable in blues while still recognizing and emphasizing the great diversity observable within these patterns. Secondly, this reconciliation of homogeneity and differentiation is accomplished for the evolutionary process of the blues' development. Thirdly, the evolution of the blues is seen as having been influenced by a multitude of factors. These factors are treated not as sufficient causes for evolutionary change in the music, but as having created the structure of opportunities within which individual actors have acted to change the blues. Lastly, the formulation seeks to locate the blues accurately within the social context in which it was performed and which conditioned its development. The result, a more rounded and comprehensive representation of the blues, more nearly coincides 'with reality than those of other scholars...|$|E

40|$|Infections {{caused by}} Salmonella enterica, a Gram-negative facultative {{anaerobic}} bacteria {{belonging to the}} family of Enterobacteriaceae, are major threats to the health of humans and animals. The recent availability of complete genome data of pathogenic strains of the S. enterica gives new avenues for the identification of drug targets and drug candidates. We have used the genomic and metabolic pathway data to identify pathways and proteins essential to the pathogen and absent from the host. We took the whole proteome sequence data of 42 strains of S. enterica and Homo sapiens along with KEGG-annotated metabolic pathway data, clustered proteins sequences using CD-HIT, identified essential genes using DEG database and discarded S. enterica homologs of human proteins in unique metabolic pathways (UMPs) and characterized hypothetical proteins with SVM-prot and InterProScan. Through this core proteomic analysis we have identified enzymes essential to the pathogen. The identification of 73 enzymes common in 42 strains of S. enterica is the real strength of the current study. We proposed all 73 unexplored enzymes as potential drug targets against the infections caused by the S. enterica. The study is comprehensive around S. enterica and simultaneously considered every possible pathogenic strain of S. enterica. <b>This</b> <b>comprehensiveness</b> turned the current study significant since, {{to the best of our}} knowledge it is the first subtractive core proteomic analysis of the unique metabolic pathways applied to any pathogen for the identification of drug targets. We applied extensive computational methods to shortlist few potential drug targets considering the druggability criteria e. g. Non-homologous to the human host, essential to the pathogen and playing significant role in essential metabolic pathways of the pathogen (i. e. S. enterica). In the current study, the subtractive proteomics through a novel approach was applied i. e. by considering only proteins of the unique metabolic pathways of the pathogens and mining the proteomic data of all completely sequenced strains of the pathogen, thus improving the quality and application of the results. We believe that the sharing of the knowledge from this study would eventually lead to bring about novel and unique therapeutic regimens against the infections caused by the S. enterica...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} agencification and quangocratisation (AQ) through {{a comparison of the}} experiences of South Korea and the UK. Although a number of studies of AQ have been produced recently, these reforms remain inadequately understood. Since AQ involves the structural disaggregation of administrative units from existing departments, executive agencies and quangos have distinct characteristics which are quite different from ordinary core departments. There are a number of factors which influence these changes; and this thesis explores nine existing theories which are available to explain these phenomena. 	Case studies are presented of Tate Modern in the UK and the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MMCA), which are carefully analysed to examine the validity of those nine arguments. Although cultural agencies, which show some unique features, have become increasingly {{an essential part of the}} national economy, they have scarcely been researched from the viewpoint of public policy. This thesis endeavours to explore distinctive characteristics of this policy area; and moreover, it examines the diverse variables which have an impact on policy formation and its results through the process of comparison of arguments. 	The major tasks of this thesis are to investigate the applicability of the nine arguments and to weigh their merits. As a corollary of <b>this</b> <b>comprehensiveness,</b> it examines the whole public sectors of both countries, in order to show the broader picture and to understand the processes of changes and their backgrounds. More profoundly, similarities and differences between both countries are compared from both macro and micro perspectives. At the same time, the results of AQ are analysed through the comparison of outputs or outcomes before and after these changes, with a view to exploring whether their rationales are appropriate. Furthermore, it also examines the institutional constraints which influence not only the change of agencies but also their performances. Besides which, it seeks to find strategies for overcoming these constraints. 	This thesis adopts systematic and comprehensive approaches regarding basic concepts and data. It draws on theories of comparative research, the scope of the public sector, the classification and analysis of agencies and quangos, and theories underlying the detailed components of each argument and epistemological assumptions. Therefore, it suggests various aspects which enable us to broaden our understanding of the changes within the public sector; and to generate practical understanding to inform real world reform...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to uncover the {{considerable}} contribution to antebellum reform made by a small unassuming frontier community in Indiana, That this community has been largely neglected in social histories of the United States is probably because the region did not produce any nationally outstanding figure as well-'known as William Lloyd Garrison., Elijah Love joy,, Theodore Weld, James Birney or Elizabeth Cady Stanton. This dissertation is an in-depth look at a group of so-called ordinary men and women who were really rather extraordinary in the enlightened positions they took. The two decades, 1826 - 1846, were the major years of Newport's ascendancy as a leading community in antebellum reform, Newport was made up largely of members of the Society of Friends, many of whom had migrated to the area from the Carolinas {{and other parts of the}} South to escape the spreading institution of slavery. Their opposition to slavery, then, was part of their religious tradition, and included aiding runaways to reach free soil. I t was only, however # among the more activist Friends, centered mainly in Newport that organized efforts to manage more efficiently antislavery activities resulted in that community being dubbed the "Grand Central Station" in the Underground Railroad. The outstanding individual in these efforts was Levi Coffin, reputed "President of the Underground Railroad," His coming to Newport in 1826 marked the beginning of organized, wisely managed efforts to oppose slavery. This included such activities as an antislavery tract society, an antislavery library, antislavery newspapers, antislavery societies (including also a young men's antislavery society and a female antislavery society), schools for free blacks and fugitives, as well as the free Produce Movement, an attempt to encourage abstension from the purchase of goods produced by slave labor. In this, Coffin and the Newport reform leaders were opposed by many, a vast majority at first, who felt their direct action methods were too revolutionary and disruptive and as a result were counterproductive, So severe was the disagreement that a rupture of eleven years took place in the Indiana Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends. By 1846, public toleration of abolition was such that Newport leaders felt little imperative to continue agitation for antislavery causes, instead, they centered their efforts in the political solution offered by the formation of the Liberty Party. The Newport community led in other popular contemporary reform movements including temperance, women's rights, education, and the peace movement. <b>This</b> <b>comprehensiveness</b> of 2 lewport antebellum reform was consistent with antebellum reform in general. All the reforms were interrelated, all part of a larger pattern of moral planning. The cause of human rights embraced not only the freeing of slaves from bondage, but also the liberating of women from the bonds of less than equal status with men, the freeing, of the uneducated from the restrictions imposed by ignorance, the prohibition of the abuse of alcohol which shackled man's reason and will, and tie lifting from man of the curse of war. The Newport reformers believed in racial equality as tenaciously as did the Garrisonians or the Weld abolitionists. They seemed to have recognized that rhetoric, as ennobling and inspiriting as it can be, can also grow shrill and tiresome in its self-righteousness. Their reform was the kind of responsible reform directed at those around them [...] their family, friends, and neighbors [...] rather than at the faraway "demon" at whom shots can be taken with relative assurance he cannot immediate retaliate.

40|$|Among the {{hypotheses}} {{which have been}} advanced to explain a country's international trade patterns the neo-factor proportions hypothesis and, more recently, the neo-technology hypothesis have exerted particular appeal both in theory and in empirical testing. The former introduces intercountry differences in human capital endowment and interindutry differences in human capital requirements as decisive determinants of international specialization into {{the framework of a}} Heckscher-Ohlin world; the latter stresses intercountry differences in the capability to innovate and interindustry differences in susceptibility to innovations as the major force governing structure and change of a country's comparative advantage. Although formulated as two separate hypotheses, the difference between them is not immediately obvious. The main difficulty in differentiating stems from the comprehensive character of the human capital concept, as such surely encompassing innovativeness, the key variable of the neo-technology hypotheses. Yet <b>this</b> very <b>comprehensiveness</b> means that characteristics other than innovativeness can also account for human capital. Put differently, human capital is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for innovativeness, both across countries and across industries. Further, innovativeness differs from other possible components of human capital in that in leads to intercountry differences in production technology - a determinant of trade flows explicitely ruled out by the neo-factor proportions hypothesis. ...|$|R

60|$|After {{the middle}} of the last century the insurrection against the pretensions of the Church and against the doctrines of Christianity was marked in one of its most {{important}} phases by a new and most significant feature. In this phase it was animated at once by the scientific idea and by the social idea. It was an advance both in knowledge and in moral motive. It rested on a conception which was crude and imperfect enough, but which was still almost, like the great ecclesiastical conception itself, a conception of life as a whole. Morality, positive law, social order, economics, the nature and limits of human knowledge, the constitution of the physical universe, had one by one disengaged themselves from theological explanations. The final philosophical movement of the century in France, which was represented by Diderot, now tended to a new social synthesis resting on a purely positive basis. If this movement had only added to its other contents the historic idea, its destination would have been effectually reached. As it was, its leaders surveyed the entire field with as much accuracy and with as wide a range as their instruments allowed, and they scattered over the world a set of ideas which at once entered into energetic rivalry with the ancient scheme of authority.

Future research in this area could build upon this work with a revised instrument that accounts for these issues. The other main limitation of this work is the lack of <b>comprehensiveness.</b> <b>This</b> model is only able to explain between 28 and 56 % of the variation in success (by component) indicating that participatory behaviors alone are insufficient to capture the complexity of this response; therefore, we stipulate that future research in this area should include variables that encompass prior knowledge, past experience, teaching practices, and demographic factors in an attempt to supply the information necessary to explain the as yet unaccounted for variation in success. That being said, while we acknowledge that external influences do exist (i.e., teaching practices), we contend that each student’s achievement is ultimately the result of his/her own actions within the course and students must share in the responsibility for their success. Thus, we see this work not as a forest with missing trees, but rather as a close, careful examination of a single tree within the larger forest that has merit in and of itself.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Patient {{encounters}} are {{the core}} learning activity of Australian general practice (family practice) training. Exposure to patient demographics and presentations may vary from one general practice registrar (vocational trainee) to another. <b>This</b> can affect <b>comprehensiveness</b> of training. Currently, {{there is no}} mechanism to systematically capture the content of GP registrar consultations. The aim of the Registrar Clinical Encounters in Training (ReCEnT) study is to document longitudinally the nature and associations of consultation-based clinical and educational experiences of general practice registrars. Methods/design This is an ongoing prospective multi-site cohort study of general practice registrars’ consultations, entailing paper-based recording of consultation data. The study setting is general practices affiliated with three geographically-based Australian general practice regional training providers. Registrars record details of 60 consecutive consultations. Data collected includes registrar demographics, details of the consultation, patient demographics, reasons for encounter and problems managed. Problems managed are coded with the International Classification of Primary Care (second edition) classification system. Additionally, registrars record educational factors related to the encounter. The study will follow the clinical exposure of each registrar six-monthly over the 18 months to two years (full-time equivalent) of their general practice training program. Conclusions The study will provide data {{on a range of}} factors (patient, registrar and consultation factors). This data will be used to inform a range of educational decisions as well as being used to answer educational research questions. We plan to use ReCEnT as a formative assessment tool for registrars and help identify and address educational needs. The study will facilitate program evaluation by the participating training providers and thus improve articulation of educational programs with practice experience. From the research point of view it will address an evidence gap – the in-practice clinical and educational experience of general practice trainees, determinants of these experiences, and the determinants of registrars’ patterns of practice (for example, prescribing practice) over the course of their training. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} issue for neurophysiological {{studies of the}} visual system {{is the definition of}} the region of the visual field that can modify a neuron's activity (i. e., the neuron's receptive field – RF). Usually a trade-off exists between precision and the time required to map a RF. Manual methods (qualitative) are fast but impose a variable degree of imprecision, while quantitative methods are more precise but usually require more time. We describe a rapid quantitative method for mapping visual RFs that is derived from computerized tomography and named back-projection. This method finds the intersection of responsive regions of the visual field based on spike density functions that are generated over time in response to long bars moving in different directions. An algorithm corrects the response profiles for latencies and allows for the conversion of the time domain into a 2 D-space domain. The final product is an RF map that shows the distribution of the neuronal activity in visual–spatial coordinates. In addition to mapping the RF, this method also provides functional properties, such as latency, orientation and direction preference indexes. This method exhibits the following beneficial properties: (a) speed; (b) ease of implementation; (c) precise RF localization; (d) sensitivity (this method can map RFs based on few responses); (e) reliability (this method provides consistent information about RF shapes and sizes, which will allow for comparative studies); (f) <b>comprehensiveness</b> (<b>this</b> method can scan for RFs over an extensive area of the visual field); (g) informativeness (it provides functional quantitative data about the RF); and (h) usefulness (this method can map RFs in regions without direct retinal inputs, such as the cortical representations of the optic disc and of retinal lesions, which should allow for studies of functional connectivity, reorganization and neural plasticity). Furthermore, our method allows for precise mapping of RFs in a 30 ° by 30 ° area of the visual field for an array of microelectrodes of any size in less than 6 min...|$|R
40|$|The voluminous {{works of}} the Judaean {{historian}} Flavius Josephus have been {{and continue to be}} of tremendous importance for our understanding of the worlds in which he lived. For centuries his works have been thoroughly investigated by scholars in diverse fields. Until more recently, however, the Roman context in which Josephus lived as he wrote was rarely explored at length, {{despite the fact that it}} is indispensable for our knowledge and understanding of the man and the historian. Recent scholarship has, however, taken up the exploration of his interactions with his environment with enthusiasm, undermining longstanding conceptions regarding his relationship with the Roman world in the process. The present study builds on these current trends and considers particularly the social circumstances in which Josephus lived in Rome during the latter part of his life. By exploring the relationship between Josephus and each of the Flavian emperors-Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian-individually, this study seeks to explore the nature of these relationships more comprehensively than has been done in the past. <b>This</b> aim of <b>comprehensiveness</b> is achieved in part by beginning not with Josephus' arrival in Rome in AD 71, but with his first voyage to the imperial capital during the reign of Nero, and by considering also the contact between Josephus and the future Roman emperors within the Roman army camp in Judaea during the course of the 1 st Judaean War. In the examination of these relationships, this study supports the increasing recognition in Josephan scholarship that the Judaean historian cannot justifiably be characterized as a 'Flavian lackey' or propagandist, a view that has not yet been fully accepted by non-Josephan scholars. Having established the possible parameters of his relationships with the imperial family, the study also explores the contact between Josephus and other inhabitants of Rome, including the Herodian princes and the patron of his final works, the freedman Epaphroditus, in an attempt to determine as clearly as possible the social circles in which he functioned as he lived out the final years of his life in the city of Rome...|$|R
40|$|Medical {{cartography}} {{can provide}} valuable {{insights into the}} epidemiology and ecology of infectious diseases, providing a quantitative representation {{of the distribution of}} these pathogens. Such methods therefore provide a key step in informing public health policy decisions ranging from prioritising sites for further investigation to identifying targets for interventions. By increasing the resolution at which risk is defined, policymakers are provided with an increasingly informed approach for considering next steps as well as evaluating past progress. In spite of their benefits however, global maps of infectious disease are lacking in both quality and <b>comprehensiveness.</b> <b>This</b> thesis sets out to investigate the next steps for medical cartography and details the use of species distribution models in evaluating global distributions of a variety of zoonotic diseases of public health importance. Chapter 2 defines a methodology by which global targets for infectious disease mapping can be quantitatively assessed by comparing the global burden of each disease with the demand from national policymakers, non-governmental organisations and academic communities for global assessments of disease distribution. Chapter 3 introduces the use of boosted regression trees for mapping the distribution of a group of vector-borne diseases identified as being a high priority target, the leishmaniases. Chapter 4 adapts these approaches to consider Ebola virus disease. This technique shows that the West African outbreak was ecologically consistent with past infections and suggests a much wider area of risk than previously considered. Chapter 5 investigates Marburg virus disease and considers the variety of different factors relating to all aspects of the transmission cycle that must be considered in these analyses. Chapters 6 and 7 complete the mapping of the suite of viral haemorrhagic fevers by assessing the distribution of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever and Lassa fever. Finally, Chapter 8 considers the risk that these viral haemorrhagic fevers present to the wider African continent, quantifying potential risk of spillover infections, local outbreaks and more widespread infection. This thesis addresses important information gaps in global knowledge of a number of pathogens of public health importance. In doing so, this work provides a template for considering the global distribution of a number of other zoonotic diseases. </p...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the current}} {{explosion}} of user-generated content {{driven by the}} ever-decreasing price of sensing and storage hardware the dream of capturing and archiving the entirety of a human life is slowly being realised. The Semantic Web, a discipline of Computer Science, aims to support the sharing and interoperation of knowledge using the Web’s infrastructure. This thesis aims to roadmap a framework utilising the principles and technologies underpinning the Semantic Web, enabling the vision of global knowledge sharing, in an open and policy aware manner, with the end aim of supporting a network for the exploitation of personal information. This sharing is facilitated through {{the adoption of a}} lingua franca, shared conceptualisations for domain knowledge, and some core design principles. The main focus of Semantic Web research has been the development of a web-scale knowledge-base whereby information is stored and exposed in a machine-readable format with the ultimate aim of aggregating information from disparate sources, allowing for statements to be contextualised with respect to others culminating in a web-scale knowledge resource accessible through standard protocols. The current popularity of social computing – Web 2. 0 – where users post personal information to online communities is eluding to the fact that information, linked and shared within a social-context presents added value to the end-user. Given the sensitive nature of personal information, one may not wish to expose all of the information about them self to the World Wide Web, but may wish to benefit by linking to knowledge residing on this shared resource. This ability to store personal information privately, in ones own personal web-space and not on a third party server, whilst at the same time connecting to the publicly available information is presented as key challenge facing the Computer Science community today. Specific information pertaining to one aspect of a user’s activities, such as their picture taking habits or their geographic log, may not present a detailed account of a user’s actions, but as more information is pushed into the public domain and aggregation technologies mature individuals and their day-to-day activities will be easier to track. As more and more of our personal lives are pushed into the public domain, the notion of an online-persona {{is becoming more and more}} applicable to the average person. This thesis presents an infrastructure for the capturing and archival of autobiographical metadata, whereby information from multiple sensors is aggregated and stored in a personal Lifelog. The surrender of digital identity has become commonplace, for purposes ranging from commerce, marketing, social networking, government, receipt of services, travel or security, Lifelogging has the potential to reaffirm the individual’s control of his or her own digital identity. The Lifelog is a constructed identity that outweighs the others simply by weight of evidence, complexity and <b>comprehensiveness.</b> <b>This</b> thesis presents an infrastructure for the capture and exploitation of personal metadata to drive research into context aware systems. The aim is to expose ongoing research in the areas of capture of personal experiences, context aware systems, multimedia annotation systems, narrative generation, all set in the context of enabling and supporting the Semantic Web Vision. The thesis details the work underway towards the goal of creating a multi-domain contextual log, and is followed by a discussion of how such a log can be used to drive the development of detailed Lifelog and an investigation into the amount of personal information being pushed into the public domain. <br/...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} English {{translation}} of Musica mechanica organoedi, originally published in Berlin in 1768. Its author Jacob Adlung (1699 - 1762) was a musician and scholar and organist at the Predigerkirche in Erfurt. The Musica mechanica organoedi focuses primarily on the organ, {{from the perspective of}} the information an organist might need to know about the instrument; specifically, it encompasses the following: • an evaluation, from an 18 th-century perspective, of earlier works on its subject: Praetorius, Werkmeister, Mattheson, Niedt, Kircher and others • an appreciation of the organ: its value and regard • the history of the organ • a thorough description of all the parts of an organ, and all facets of the organbuilder’s art, including definitions of several hundred organ stops. • suggestions about organ registration: the use and combination of stops, and how to go about choosing what stops an organ shall have • advice to those who intend to purchase an organ: cost, advantages and faults, testing, maintenance and repair • temperament and tuning • construction and assessment of other keyboard instruments, notably the harpsichord and clavichord with pedal • stoplists of almost 90 organs of various types and sizes (most of them in Germany). One of Mmo’s most valuable features is its attempt to be a compendium of information from earlier sources. Adlung not only recorded his own ideas and observations, but incorporated those of every previous major German publication that treats the organ, beginning with Praetorius’s Syntagma musicum (1619). <b>This</b> attempt at <b>comprehensiveness</b> is interesting because it gathers information from so many diverse sources, and because in commenting on his predecessors Adlung offers yet another perspective (closer to the sources than any commentary from our time) on the matters they treat. His work is therefore, more than any other contemporary publication, a mirror of the state of knowledge and preferences concerning the 18 th-century German organ. Left unpublished at Adlung 2 ̆ 7 s death, the work was entrusted to Johann Lorenz Albrecht (1732 - 73), Cantor and Music Director at the Marienkirche in Mühlhausen. The book 2 ̆ 7 s publisher subsequently entrusted the work to his local collaborator Johann Friedrich Agricola (1720 - 1774), the Royal Prussian Court Composer and a former student of J. S. Bach, who added a further layer of commentary. The work has been translated into English by Dr. Quentin Faulkner, Larson Professor of Organ and Music Theory/History (emeritus) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Dr Faulkner holds the degrees B. Mus. cum laude from Westminster Choir College, M. S. M. and M. Th. from Southern Methodist University, and S. M. D. from Union Theological Seminary, and is the author of J. S. Bach 2 ̆ 7 s Keyboard Technique: A Historical Introduction (1984) and Wiser Than Despair: The Evolution of Ideas in the Relationship of Music and the Christian Church (1996). He was formerly an organist at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in New York City. In addition to the extensive annotations, he has added a compendium of the many organ stoplists cited but not originally included in the Mmo. This electronic edition of the work is arranged to show the German original on the left and the English translation on the facing right-hand pages. It runs 1222 pages or 68 Mb in this version.
