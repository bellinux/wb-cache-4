5|$|The {{sea otter}} hunts in short dives, often {{to the sea}} floor. Although it can hold its breath for up <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes,</b> its dives {{typically}} last about one minute {{and no more than}} four. It is the only marine animal capable of lifting and turning over rocks, which it often does with its front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may also pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into underwater mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth.|$|E

5|$|Though quite agile on land (capable {{of running}} {{as fast as}} a horse), capybaras are equally at home in the water. They are {{excellent}} swimmers, and can remain completely submerged for up <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes,</b> an ability they use to evade predators. Capybaras can sleep in water, keeping only their noses out of the water. As temperatures increase during the day, they wallow in water and then graze during the late afternoon and early evening. They also spend time wallowing in mud. They rest around midnight and then continue to graze before dawn.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine as a {{manufactured}} {{medication is}} sold under the trade names Intropin, Dopastat, and Revimine, among others. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is most commonly used as a stimulant drug {{in the treatment of}} severe low blood pressure, slow heart rate, and cardiac arrest. It is especially important in treating these in newborn infants. It is given intravenously. Since the half-life of dopamine in plasma is very short—approximately one minute in adults, two minutes in newborn infants and up <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> in preterm infants—it is usually given in a continuous intravenous drip rather than a single injection.|$|E
5|$|After {{creating}} custom plugins for the 3D {{computer graphics}} software, Burrows {{claimed that the}} team could create and test entire race tracks within five minutes. The custom plugin used for creating tracks consisted of a 450 kilobyte file, which contained polygon subdividing and data on artificial intelligence, effectively cutting down the time to create tracks from six hours <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes.</b> In order to the play the game as soon as possible, the team developed the user interface in the XML markup language, which allowed revisions {{to be made for}} the content at any time. However, Burrows recalled that the only downside to converting everything to XML was that the game was always in danger of becoming too large for the PlayStation Portable's Universal Media Disc. The game's cover art was designed by Popgun, who also designed the logos for games released by EA Sports.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{proximity}} to land, Greta initially maintained a well-defined structure. The hurricane continued generally west-northwestward {{due to the}} ridge to the north, and initially was expected to enter the Bay of Campeche. After passing through the Bay Islands off northern Honduras, Greta weakened slightly while approaching Belize, and made landfall near Dangriga at 0000UTC on September19, with winds of about 110mph (175km/h). The calm of the eye was reported for three <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> there. Rapidly weakening over land, the hurricane deteriorated to tropical depression status over Guatemala within 12hours of landfall. A large high pressure area from the Carolinas to the central Gulf of Mexico turned Greta southwestward toward the eastern Pacific Ocean. At 0000UTC on September20, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) took over responsibility for issuing advisories while Greta was 30mi (50km) from the coast. Soon after, the depression emerged over the warm waters of the eastern Pacific and re-intensified. At 0600UTC, the depression re-attained tropical storm status and named Olivia by the EPHC. After initially moving to the north, Olivia began executing a slow counterclockwise loop. Based on observations from nearby ships and radar, it is estimated Olivia attained hurricane status early on September22. While tracking towards the Mexican coastline, the system weakened below hurricane threshold; between 1900 and 2000UTC, Olivia made landfall about 60mi (95km) east of Salina Cruz. Early on September23, Olivia dissipated over the Mexican state of Chiapas.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from these}} broadcasts, each {{candidate}} could send in commercials up <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes,</b> which were broadcast on weekdays between 1 and 25 August, three times daily (8:00, 18:00 and 20:00).|$|E

25|$|Pu-erh teas require {{boiling water}} for infusion. Some prefer to quickly rinse pu-erh for several seconds with boiling water to remove tea dust which accumulates from the ageing process, then infuse it at the boiling point (100°C or 212°F), {{and allow it to}} steep from 30 seconds <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{shown by}} the table above, because many {{procedures}} are optional, border guards have discretion in deciding how rigorously they check travellers at external border crossing points. As a result, {{the length of time}} taken to perform checks differs between Schengen countries. Under the previous regime (whereby those with the right to freedom of movement were subject only to a 'minimum check'), an entry check for an EU, EEA or Swiss citizen took around five seconds on average in Italy, whilst in Norway, on average it took around 1 minute. The disparities in checks on third-country nationals (who are subject to a more thorough check) are even greater. For example, an entry check for an Annex II national takes around 15 seconds on average in Greece, whilst it takes three <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> on average in Slovakia. Similarly, an entry check for an Annex I national on average lasts around 30–60 seconds in The Netherlands, whilst in Latvia, it lasts around two <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> on average.|$|E
25|$|Metro service {{starts at}} 05:24 am and 05:30 am and stops at 01:00 on weekdays and Sunday, and 01:30 on Saturday. However, the Blue Line service stops earlier, at 00:15 due to lower {{passenger}} volumes. During rush hour, {{there are two}} <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> between trains on the Orange and Green Lines. The frequency, however, decreases to 12 minutes during late nights.|$|E

Winning submissions are shown in Seattle and Portland theaters, providing a unique experience as straight, gay male, bi, lesbian, and fetish porn are all shown together, one after another. Savage publicly destroys the submissions after conclusion of the festival.|$|E
25|$|Air {{traffic control}} was {{notified}} {{at this point}} (at 17:19:15), who could not confirm any traffic in the indicated position. After three <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> the objects assumed a side-to-side configuration, which they maintained for another 10 minutes. They accompanied the aircraft with an undulating motion, and some back and forth rotation of the jet nozzles, {{which seemed to be}} under automatic control, causing them to flare with brighter or duller luminosity.|$|E

In the video version and single version the lengthy instrumental break is completely omitted. In the video and single versions the refrain is abridged as well, Lorraine Crosby sings six verses in the complete song. In the video version {{the second and third}} verses are omitted. In the single version the second, third, and fifth verses are omitted.|$|E

25|$|Diazepam, first {{marketed as}} Valium, is a {{medication}} of the benzodiazepine family that typically produces a calming effect. It {{is commonly used}} to treat a range of conditions including anxiety, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, muscle spasms, seizures, trouble sleeping, and restless legs syndrome. It may {{also be used to}} cause memory loss during certain medical procedures. It can be taken by mouth, inserted into the rectum, injected into muscle, or injected into a vein. When given into a vein, effects begin in one <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> and last up to an hour. By mouth, effects may take 40 minutes to begin.|$|E
25|$|After {{the opening}} of the loop, the line became a much more profitable. Despite being longer, it could still be run with only seven trams; the higher speed up the Singsaker Hill allowed faster travel times. Ridership in November 1955 was up 33 percent since the {{previous}} November. Subsequently, the Solhaug bus route operated by Trondheim Bilruter had lost sufficient ridership to be terminated. During rush hour, an extra tram was put into service, decreasing the intervals from six <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes.</b> Eventually trailers were also put into use. All this was despite a price increase with 50% in 1955.|$|E
25|$|It {{takes the}} average cow three <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> {{to give her}} milk. Some cows are faster or slower. Slow-milking cows may take up to fifteen minutes to let down all their milk. Though milking speed {{is not related to}} the quality of milk {{produced}} by the cow, it does impact the management of the milking process. Because most milkers milk cattle in groups, the milker can only process a group of cows at the speed of the slowest-milking cow. For this reason, many farmers will group slow-milking cows so as not to stress the faster milking cows.|$|E
