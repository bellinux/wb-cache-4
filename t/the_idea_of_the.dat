5|$|Alongside <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greater Elves, Tolkien also {{developed}} {{the idea of}} children visiting Valinor, the island-homeland of the Elves in their sleep. Elves would also visit children at night and comfort them {{if they had been}} chided or were upset. This theme, linking elves with children's dreams and nocturnal travelling was largely abandoned in Tolkien's later writing.|$|E
5|$|Although {{accepting}} the script, Spielberg asked for several changes. Spielberg had been against <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aliens arriving in spaceships, since every alien invasion movie used such a vehicle. The original Martian cylinders were discarded, where Spielberg replaced {{the origins of}} the Tripods with stating they were buried underground in the Earth long ago.|$|E

5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} {{of the country was}} also influenced by American cinema, and many of his illustrations were based on cinematic imagery. Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier thought that Tintin's arrest of Smiles had been influenced by the Buffalo Bill stories, and that <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gangsters taking Tintin away in their car came from Little Caesar.|$|E
5|$|Incidentally, the {{harmonic}} telegraph directly suggested to Bell <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> telephone.

5|$|Smyers (1999) {{notes that}} <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fox as seductress and the {{connection}} of the fox myths to Buddhism were introduced into Japanese folklore through similar Chinese stories, but she maintains that some fox stories contain elements unique to Japan.|$|E

5|$|As David Halberstam {{put it in}} {{his book}} Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made,Michael Jordan and David Falk helped make each other, and each profited to a {{remarkable}} degree from their special collaboration. It is true that Michael Jordan was the person who in the end actually did the deeds, went on the court and hit the final jump shot again and again, but {{it is also true that}} David Falk helped revolutionize the process of representing a basketball player, going into a team sport and creating <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual player as a commercial superstar.|$|E
5|$|At his death, {{the role}} of the emperor as a patron of Eastern Orthodoxy was claimed by Ivan III, Grand duke of Muscovy. He had married Andreas' sister, Sophia Paleologue, whose grandson, Ivan IV, would become the first Tsar of Russia (tsar, or czar, meaning caesar, is a term {{traditionally}} applied by Slavs to the Byzantine Emperors). Their successors supported the idea that Moscow was the proper heir to Rome and Constantinople. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian Empire as the successive Third Rome was kept alive until its demise with the Russian Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Biblical Hebrew has {{two main}} {{conjugation}} types, the suffix conjugation, {{also called the}} Perfect, and the prefix conjugation, also called Imperfect. The Perfect verb form expressed <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> verb as a completed action, viewing it {{from start to finish}} as a whole, and not focusing on the process by which the verb came to be completed, stating it as a simple fact. This is often used in the past tense, however there are some contexts in which a Perfect verb translates into the present and future tenses.|$|E
5|$|Both Buddhism and the Lingbao School share <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Five Paths of Rebirth (Gati). People were reborn into earth prisons, as {{a hungry}} ghost, as an animal, as a man, or as a {{celestial}} being. After death, the body would be alchemically refined in the Palace of Supreme Darkness {{located in the}} north, and the Southern Palace in the south. The transmutation of the body consisted of two steps; the yin components of the person were refined in the Palace of Supreme Darkness, followed by the yang components in the Southern Palace. The Lingbao concept of rebirth is a Chinese adaptation of Buddhism, mixing traditional Chinese concepts with newly arrived Buddhist ideas.|$|E
5|$|During {{his student}} years in England, Jinnah was {{influenced}} by 19th-century British liberalism, like many other future Indian independence leaders. This political education included exposure to <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> democratic nation, and progressive politics. He became an admirer of the Parsi British Indian political leaders Dadabhai Naoroji and Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. Naoroji had become the first British Member of Parliament of Indian extraction shortly before Jinnah's arrival, triumphing with a majority of three votes in Finsbury Central. Jinnah listened to Naoroji's maiden speech in the House of Commons from the visitor's gallery.|$|E

5|$|Experimental {{pop music}} {{developed}} concurrently with experimental jazz {{as a new}} kind of avant-garde, with many younger musicians embracing the practice of making studio recordings along the fringes of popular music. In the early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with musical form, orchestration, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects, and by the late 1960s, highly experimental pop music, or sounds that expanded <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> typical popular song, was positively received by young audiences. Throughout the ensuing decades, some purveyors of the style shared a literary-experimental tradition that balanced experimentation with populist cohesion.|$|E

5|$|In 997, at a royal meeting near Clonfert, Brian Boru, King of Munster, {{met with}} his long-time rival Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill, {{who was at the}} time High King of Ireland. Although <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high-kingship is {{considered}} mainly an anachronistic invention, it came into vogue in the 10th century to denote a king who had enforced his power over external territories. Máel Sechnaill assumed the Irish high-kingship after the Battle of Tara in 980.|$|E

5|$|In Chapter XVI, Poe recounts Captain James Cook's circumnavigation of {{the globe}} aboard the Resolution that reached 70°10' latitude. He also drew from A Narrative of Four Voyages (1832), an account by Benjamin Morrell that became a bestseller. A Narrative of Four Voyages may have given Poe <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{summarized}} title of his novel.

5|$|In Cicero's Dream of Scipio, {{the elder}} Scipio Africanus {{describes}} an ascent through the celestial spheres, compared {{to which the}} Earth and the Roman Empire dwindle into insignificance.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to early Qenya, the grammar of Quenya {{was influenced by}} Finnish, an agglutinative language, but much more by Latin, a synthetic and fusional language, and also Greek, from which he probably took <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diglossia of Quenya with its highly codified variety: the Parmaquesta, used only in certain situations such as literature. Also the phonology of Quenya was inspired by certain aspects of Finnish, {{but this is not}} easily recognised.|$|E
