In the same study, the highest mortality rate for indigenous isolates (94 %) and CSc (98 %) was reached at 250 and 1000 IJs/larva/Petri concentrations after <b>third</b> <b>day</b> exposure time, respectively. The highest mortality rate for S. carpocapsae Turkish isolate E 76 -S (85 %) was reached at the concentration of 100 IJs/larva/Petri after the third exposure time.
