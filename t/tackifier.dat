5000|$|<b>Tackifiers</b> are {{chemical}} compounds used in formulating adhesives {{to increase the}} tack, the stickiness of {{the surface of the}} adhesive.

5000|$|Many {{pressure-sensitive}} adhesives are a {{blend of}} rubbers (natural or synthetic) and a tackifying resin.

5000|$|These {{materials}} {{often are}} blended with a <b>tackifier</b> to produce permanent tack(“grabbing power”) at room temperature, are somewhat deformable, have low surface energy, and are moisture resistant.

5000|$|Amorphous {{polyolefin}} (APO/APAO) polymers {{are compatible}} with many solvents, <b>tackifiers,</b> waxes, and polymers; they find wide use in many adhesive applications. APO hot melts have good fuel and acid resistance, moderate heat resistance, are tacky, soft and flexible, have good adhesion and longer open times than crystalline polyolefins. APOs tend to have lower melt viscosity, better adhesion, longer open times and slow set times than comparable EVAs. Some APOs can be used alone, but often they are compounded with <b>tackifiers,</b> waxes, and plasticizers (e.g., mineral oil, poly-butene oil). Examples of APOs include amorphous (atactic) propylene (APP), amorphous propylene/ethylene (APE), amorphous propylene/butene (APB), amorphous propylene/hexene (APH), amorphous propylene/ethylene/butene. APP is harder than APE, which is harder than APB, which is harder than APH, in accordance with decreasing crystallinity. APOs show relatively low cohesion, the entangled polymer chains have fairly high degree of freedom of movement. Under mechanical load, most of the strain is dissipated by elongation and disentanglement of polymer chains, and {{only a small fraction}} reaches the adhesive-substrate interface. Cohesive failure is therefore a more common failure mode of APOs.|$|R

50|$|The natures of {{the polymer}} and the {{additives}} used to increase tackiness (called tackifiers) influence {{the nature of}} mutual molecular interaction and interaction with the substrate. In one common system, EVA is used as the main polymer, with terpene-phenol resin (TPR) as the <b>tackifier.</b> The two components display acid-base interactions between the carbonyl groups of vinyl acetate and hydroxyl groups of TPR, complexes are formed between phenolic rings of TPR and hydroxyl groups {{on the surface of}} aluminium substrates, and interactions between carbonyl groups and silanol groups on surfaces of glass substrates are formed. Polar groups, hydroxyls and amine groups can form acid-base and hydrogen bonds with polar groups on substrates like paper or wood or natural fibers. Nonpolar polyolefin chains interact well with nonpolar substrates. Good wetting of the substrate is essential for forming a satisfying bond between the adhesive and the substrate. More polar compositions tend to have better adhesion due to their higher surface energy. Amorphous adhesives deform easily, tending to dissipate most of mechanical strain within their structure, passing only small loads on the adhesive-substrate interface; even a relatively weak nonpolar-nonpolar surface interaction can form a fairly strong bond prone primarily to a cohesive failure. The distribution of molecular weights and degree of crystallinity influences the width of melting temperature range. Polymers with crystalline nature tend to be more rigid and have higher cohesive strength than the corresponding amorphous ones, but also transfer more strain to the adhesive-substrate interface. Higher molecular weight of the polymer chains provides higher tensile strength and heat resistance. Presence of unsaturated bonds makes the adhesive more susceptible to autoxidation and UV degradation and necessitates use of antioxidants and stabilizers.|$|E

30|$|More recently, a {{synthesized}} biopolymer (BP) {{was recognized}} {{as an alternative to}} conventional chemical-based <b>tackifiers</b> such as PAM. Natural and industrial by-products may be sources of BPs synthesis (Sojka et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2008). The BPs provide a cost advantage and an additional safety to environments by using natural and non-toxic materials such as lignin, starch, sugar, cellulose etc. (Parker and Ring 2005; Sojka et al. 20052007). Woodhouse and Johnson (1991) partially insisted that the effects of BPs on plant growth would be similar or better than the use of PAM. However, the effectiveness of BP for soil erosion control and its safety have not been clearly defined relative to that of PAM. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of PAM and BP applications on soil erosion control, water quality enhancement, and growth stimulation of Chinese cabbage.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Utilizing a {{rainfall}} simulator, a sunlight simulator, and a wind generator, the Utah Water Research Laboratory (UWRL), Utah State University (USU), {{completed in}} 1979 and 1981 {{a series of}} evaluations of erosion control products for CONWED Corporation. Increasingly more commercial products for controlling erosion are being produced nationally and there remains a need {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of these, one against another, in order that potential users may make cost-effective decisions in their use.

5000|$|Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers, low-performance, the {{low-cost}} {{and most}} common {{material for the}} glue sticks (e.g., the light amber colored Thermogrip GS51, GS52, and GS53). They provide sufficient strength between 30 and 50 °C but are limited to use below 60-80 °C and have low creep resistance under load. The vinyl acetate monomer content is about 18-29 percent by weight of the polymer. High amounts of tackifiers and waxes are often used; an example composition is 30-40% of EVA copolymer (provides strength and toughness), 30-40% of <b>tackifier</b> resin (improves wetting and tack), 20-30% of wax (usually paraffin-based; reduces viscosity, alters setting speed, reduces cost), and 0.5-1% of stabilizers. Fillers can be added for special applications. Can be formulated for service temperatures ranging from −40 to +80 °C, and for both short and long open times and {{a wide range of}} melt viscosities. High stability at elevated temperatures and resistance to ultraviolet radiation, which can be further enhanced with suitable stabilizers. High vinylacetate content can serve for formulating a hot-melt pressure-sensitive adhesive (HMPSA). EVA formulations are compatible with paraffin. EVA was the base for the original hot melt composition. The composition of the copolymer influences its properties; increased content of ethylene promotes adhesion to nonpolar substrates such as polyethylene, while increased content of vinyl acetate promotes adhesion to polar substrates such as paper. Higher ethylene content also increases mechanical strength, block resistance, and paraffin solubility. Higher vinyl acetate content provides higher flexibility, adhesion, hot tack, and better low-temperature performance. Adhesive grade EVA usually contains 14-35% vinyl acetate. Lower molecular weight chains provide lower melt viscosity, better wetting, and better adhesion to porous surfaces. Higher molecular weights provide better cohesion at elevated temperatures and better low-temperature behavior. Increased ratio of vinyl acetate lowers the crystallinity of the material, improves optical clarity, flexibility and toughness, and worsens resistance to solvents. EVA can be crosslinked by, e.g., peroxides, yielding a thermosetting material. EVAs can be compounded with aromatic hydrocarbon resins. Grafting butadiene to EVA improves its adhesion. Its dielectric properties are poor due to high content of polar groups, the dielectric loss is moderately high. Polypropylene HMAs are a better choice for high-frequency electronics. EVAs are optically clearer and more gas and vapor permeable than polyolefins. Nearly half of EVA HMAs is used in packaging applications. Cryogenic grinding of EVAs can provide small, water-dispersible particles for heat-seal applications. EVA can degrade primarily by loss of acetic acid and formation of a double bond in the chain, and by oxidative degradation. EVA can be compounded into a wide range of HMAs, from soft pressure-sensitive adhesives to rigid structural adhesives for furniture construction.|$|E
40|$|The {{interphase}} transfer {{behavior of}} poly(styrene-co-α-methyl styrene), {{which is known}} as a <b>tackifier</b> in rubber industry, is investigated using poly(butadiene) rubber (BR) and poly(styrene-co-butadiene) rubber (SBR). The films of pure rubbers and the blends with the <b>tackifier</b> were prepared by a solution-cast method using toluene as a solvent. Two sheets composed of different rubbers, in which the <b>tackifier</b> was mixed at least in one rubber sheet, were piled together and annealed beyond the glass transition temperature Tg of the <b>tackifier.</b> The transfer phenomenon of the <b>tackifier</b> between the sheets was evaluated by the peak shift in the tensile loss modulus E" curve, ascribed to Tg of the rubbers, which was measured by the dynamic mechanical analysis. Moreover, crystallization temperature of BR was also employed as a measure of the transfer, because the <b>tackifier</b> retards the crystallization of BR. It is found that the <b>tackifier</b> moves from one rubber to another during annealing procedure to reduce severe localization. When the content is the same in each rubber, the <b>tackifier</b> immigrates from BR to SBR, suggesting a better miscibility with SBR. This behavior is attributed to the small difference in the solubility parameter between SBR and the <b>tackifier</b> as compared to that between BR and the <b>tackifier...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Epoxidized {{natural rubber}} latex with 50 mole % epoxidization {{referred}} to as ENR 50 L was produced by in situ generated peracids. ENR 50 L was subsequently concentrated to ENR 50 L concentrate (ENR 50 LC) via ultrafiltration membrane separation process. Both, ENR 50 Latices (ENR 50 L and ENR 50 LC) were evaluated for the formulation of latex-based pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs). In this work, evaluation of hydrocarbon and rosin ester <b>tackifier</b> dispersions in ENR 50 Latices- based PSAs were performed through viscosity and peel adhesion test.

40|$|Bisphenol A based {{thermoplastic}} polyesters {{are commonly}} used in the industry as binders, or <b>tackifiers,</b> to produce cost-saving preforms in Liquid Composite Moulding processes such as Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Moulding (VARTM). However, it is often reported {{that the presence of}} these polyesters has a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties of the resulting composite laminates. In contrast, this study shows that interlaminar toughness can be increased without negatively affecting other properties by coating the reinforcing plies with a bisphenol A based thermoplastic polyester if some precautions are taken in mind. The polyester was added to an epoxy resin in order to study its effect on the thermophysical properties and fracture toughness of the bulk epoxy. The polyester molecules acted as a plasticizer for the epoxy resin when the polyester was added in low amounts. This increased the bulk fracture toughness of the epoxy resin by 30 %. Polyester modified glass/epoxy laminates were produced and tested for Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness and flexural properties. The increased toughness of the epoxy matrix led to a 60 % increased Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of the laminates, without negatively affecting flexural stiffness and strength of the laminates...|$|R
5000|$|Polyolefins (PO) (polyethylene (usually LDPE {{but also}} HDPE; HDPE has higher melting point and better {{temperature}} resistance), atactic polypropylene (PP or APP), polybutene-1, oxidized polyethylene, etc.), low-performance, for difficult-to-bond plastics. Very good adhesion to polypropylene, good moisture barrier, chemical resistance against polar solvents and solutions of acids, bases, and alcohols. Longer open time {{in comparison with}} EVA and polyamides. Polyolefins have low surface energy and provide good wetting of most metals and polymers. Polyolefins made by metallocene catalyzed synthesis have narrow distribution of molecular weight and correspondingly narrow melting temperature range. Due to the relatively high crystallinity, polyethylene-based glues tend to be opaque and, depending on additives, white or yellowish. Polyethylene hot melts have high pot life stability, are not prone to charring, and are suitable for moderate temperature ranges and on porous non-flexible substrates. Nitrogen or carbon dioxide can be introduced into the melt, forming a foam which increases spreading and open time and decreases transfer of heat to the substrate, allowing use of more heat-sensitive substrates; polyethylene-based HMAs are usually used. Foamable HMAs {{are available on the}} market since 1981. Amorphous polypropylene HMAs have good dielectric properties, making them suitable for use at high frequencies. PE and APP are usually used on their own or with just a small amount of <b>tackifiers</b> (usually hydrocarbons) and waxes (usually paraffins or microcrystalline waxes, for lower cost, improved anti-blocking, and altered open time and softening temperature). The molecular weight of the polymer is usually lower. Lower molecular weights provide better low-temperature performance and higher flexibility, higher molecular weights increase the seal strength, hot tack, and melt viscosity.|$|R
40|$|Desertification is {{currently}} a major concern, and vast regions have already been devastated in the arid zones of many countries. Combined application of cyanobacteria with soil fixing chemicals is a novel method of restoring desertified areas. Three cyanobacteria, Nostoc sp. Vaucher ex Bornet & Flahault, Phormidium sp. Kützing ex Gomont and Scytonema arcangeli Bornet ex Flahault were isolated and tested in this study. Tacki-SprayTM (TKS 7), which consists of bio-polysaccharides and <b>tackifiers,</b> {{was used as a}} soil fixing agent. In addition, superabsorbent polymer (SAP) was applied to the soil as a water-holding material and nutrient supplement. Application of cyanobacteria with superabsorbent polymer and TKS 7 (CST) remarkably improved macro-aggregate stability against water and erodibility against wind after 12 months of inoculation when compared to the control soil. The mean weight diameter and threshold friction velocity of the CST treated soil were found to be 75 % and 88 % of those of the approximately 20 -year-old natural cyanobacterial crust (N-BSC), respectively, while these values were 68 % and 73 % of those of the N-BSC soil after a single treatment of cyanobacteria alone (CY). Interestingly, biological activities of CST were similar to those of CY. Total carbohydrate contents, cyanobacterial biomass, microbial biomass, soil respiration, carbon fixation and effective quantum yield of CST treated soil were enhanced by 50 - 100 % of the N-BSC, while those of control soil were negligible. Our results suggest that combined application of cyanobacteria with soil fixing chemicals can rapidly develop cyanobacterial crust formation in the field within 12 months. The physical properties and biological activities of the inoculated cyanobacterial crust were stable during the study period. The novel method presented herein serves as another approach for combating desertification in arid regions...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Liquid {{composite}} molding processes {{use both}} simple and complex sets of preforms to produce high-performance composite parts. To produce these parts, binder materials known as tackifiers {{are used to}} shape the fabrics into complicated preforms prior to the resin injection. <b>Tackifier</b> materials enhance the formability and handling operations of dry reinforcements, and {{become an integral part}} of the composite laminate. A commercial <b>tackifier</b> was employed to form fiberglass preforms. Various preforms were prepared with different concentrations of the <b>tackifier,</b> and the effect on the permeability was studied. A permeability work-cell was used to continuously measure the permeability of the tackified preform for different fiber volume fractions.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this project was to develop an energy efficient, environmentally friendly and low cost process (compared to the current process) for making <b>tackifier</b> dispersions {{that are used to}} make pressure-sensitive adhesives. These adhesives are employed in applications such as self-adhesive postage stamps and disposable diapers and are made by combining the <b>tackifier</b> dispersion with a natural or synthetic rubber latex. The current process for <b>tackifier</b> dispersion manufacture begins by melting a (plastic) resin and adding water to it in order to form a water-in-oil emulsion. This is then converted to an oil-in-water emulsion by phase inversion in the presence of continuous stirring. The resulting emulsion is the <b>tackifier</b> dispersion, but it is not concentrated and the remaining excess water has to be transported and removed. The main barrier that has to be overcome in the development of commercial quality <b>tackifier</b> dispersions is the inability to directly emulsify resin in water due to the very low viscosity of water as compared to the viscosity of the molten resin. In the present research, a number of solutions were proposed to overcome this barrier, and these included use of different mixer types to directly form the emulsion from the molten resin but without going through a phase inversion, the idea of forming a solid resin-in-water suspension having the correct size and size distribution but without melting of the resin, and the development of techniques of making a colloidal powder of the resin that could be dispersed in water just prior to use. Progress was made on each of these approaches, and each was found to be feasible. The most appealing solution, though, is the last one, since it does not require melting of the resin. Also, the powder can be shipped in dry form and then mixed with water in any proportion depending on the needs of the process. This research was conducted at Argonne National Laboratory, and it was determined the new process uses 78 % less energy than the conventional process. Additional benefits of the new process are that it can process resins that cannot presently be processed without using solvents and that it can result in new products made with mixed resins...|$|E

The influence of the compatibility of EBA hot melts on their rheological, viscoelastic, and adhesion properties to polar (aluminum foil) and nonpolar (polypropylene film) substrates were analyzed. The viscosity and shear thinning at 160 °C of EBA hot melts varied significantly by changing the <b>tackifier</b> nature; however, at 180 °C all EBA hot melts showed similar viscosities and shear thinning was absent because of the rupture of physical interactions between their components. EBA copolymer showed broad <b>tackifier</b> compatibility, even though aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon resins were less compatible. Compatibility was assessed by softening point and cloud point measurement, and dynamical mechanical thermal analysis. The most compatible EBA hot melts were obtained with rosin ester, polyterpene and cycloaliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbon tackifiers and they showed the highest tack and adhesion. On the contrary, the less-compatible EBA hot melts were obtained with aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon tackifiers, and they showed the lowest adhesion.
