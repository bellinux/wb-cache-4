5|$|Women's life {{expectancy}} is {{greater than that of}} men, and they have lower death rates <b>throughout</b> <b>life,</b> regardless of race and geographic region. Historically though, women had higher rates of mortality, primarily from maternal deaths (death in childbirth). In industrialised countries, particularly the most advanced, the gender gap narrowed and was reversed following the industrial revolution.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimate}} of a horse's age {{can be made}} from looking at its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt <b>throughout</b> <b>life</b> and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough {{estimate of}} a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.|$|E
5|$|Shark {{teeth are}} {{embedded}} in the gums rather than directly affixed to the jaw, and are constantly replaced <b>throughout</b> <b>life.</b> Multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove {{on the inside of}} the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a conveyor belt; some sharks lose 30,000 or more teeth in their lifetime. The rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months. In most species, teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row, which is observed in the cookiecutter shark.|$|E

5|$|Fruit flies (Drosophila), {{because of}} the large array of {{techniques}} available for studying their genetics, have been a natural subject for studying the role of genes in brain development. In spite of the large evolutionary distance between insects and mammals, many aspects of Drosophila neurogenetics {{have been shown to be}} relevant to humans. The first biological clock genes, for example, were identified by examining Drosophila mutants that showed disrupted daily activity cycles. A search in the genomes of vertebrates revealed a set of analogous genes, which were found to play similar roles in the mouse biological clock—and therefore almost certainly in the human biological clock as well. Studies done on Drosophila, also show that most neuropil regions of the brain are continuously reorganized <b>throughout</b> <b>life</b> in response to specific living conditions.|$|E
5|$|In {{humans and}} many other mammals, new neurons are created mainly before birth, and the infant brain {{contains}} substantially more neurons than the adult brain. There are, however, a few areas where new neurons continue to be generated <b>throughout</b> <b>life.</b> The two areas for which adult neurogenesis is well established are the olfactory bulb, which {{is involved in the}} sense of smell, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, where there is evidence that the new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories. With these exceptions, however, the set of neurons that is present in early childhood is the set that is present for life. Glial cells are different: as with most types of cells in the body, they are generated throughout the lifespan.|$|E
5|$|Józef {{received}} a milder sentence: five years' exile in Siberia, first at Kirensk on the Lena River, then at Tunka. While being transported in a prisoners' convoy to Siberia, Piłsudski {{was held for}} several weeks at a prison in Irkutsk. There he took part in what the authorities viewed as a revolt: {{after one of the}} inmates had insulted a guard and refused to apologize, he and other political prisoners were beaten by the guards for their defiance; Piłsudski lost two teeth and took part in a subsequent hunger strike until the authorities reinstated political prisoners' privileges that had been suspended after the incident. For his involvement, he was sentenced in 1888 to six months' imprisonment. He had to spend the first night of his incarceration in 40-degree-below-zero Siberian cold; this led to an illness that nearly killed him and to health problems that would plague him <b>throughout</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{alveolar}} bone is the bone of the jaw which forms the alveolus around teeth. Like any other bone {{in the human}} body, {{alveolar bone}} is modified <b>throughout</b> <b>life.</b> Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth. As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics, an area of bone under compressive force from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area of bone receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has {{a high number of}} osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.|$|E
5|$|IQ tests {{generally}} are reliable enough {{that most people}} ages ten and older have similar IQ scores <b>throughout</b> <b>life.</b> Still, some individuals score very differently when taking the same test at different times or when taking more than one kind of IQ test at the same age. For example, many children in the famous longitudinal Genetic Studies of Genius begun in 1921 by Lewis Terman showed declines in IQ as they grew up. Terman recruited school pupils based on referrals from teachers, and gave them his Stanford–Binet IQ test. Children with an IQ above 140 by that test {{were included in the}} study. There were 643 children in the main study group. When the students who could be contacted again (503 students) were retested at high school age, they were found to have dropped 9 IQ points on average in Stanford–Binet IQ. More than two dozen children dropped by 15 IQ points and six by 25 points or more. Yet parents of those children thought that the children were still as bright as ever, or even brighter.|$|E
5|$|Periyar {{fought against}} the {{orthodox}} traditions of marriage as suppression of women in Tamil Nadu and throughout the Indian sub-continent. Though arranged marriages were meant to enable a couple to live together <b>throughout</b> <b>life,</b> it was manipulated to enslave women. Much worse was the practice of child marriages practised throughout India at the time. It was believed {{that it would be}} a sin to marry after puberty. Another practice, which is prevalent today, is the dowry system where the bride's family is supposed to give the husband a huge payment for the bride. The purpose of this was to assist the newly wedded couple financially, but in many instances dowries were misused by bridegrooms. The outcome of this abuse turned to the exploitation of the bride's parents wealth, and in certain circumstances, lead to dowry deaths. There have been hundreds of thousands of cases where wives have been murdered, mutilated, and burned alive because the father of the bride was unable to make the dowry payment to the husband. Periyar fiercely stood up against this abuse meted out against women.|$|E

25|$|Animals whose {{teeth are}} all of the same type, such as most non-mammalian vertebrates, {{are said to have}} homodont {{dentition}}, whereas those whose teeth differ morphologically are said to have heterodont dentition. The dentition of animals with two successions of teeth (deciduous, permanent) is referred to as diphyodont, while the dentition of animals with only one set of teeth <b>throughout</b> <b>life</b> is monophyodont. The dentition of animals in which the teeth are continuously discarded and replaced <b>throughout</b> <b>life</b> is termed polyphyodont.|$|E
