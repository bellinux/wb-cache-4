5|$|Galeon {{continued}} after <b>the</b> <b>fork,</b> {{but lost}} its momentum {{due to the}} remaining developers' failure {{to keep up with}} the new features and changes Mozilla introduced. Galeon development finally stalled and the developers decided to work on a set of extensions to bring Galeon's advanced features to Epiphany instead.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{begins at}} the Calexico East Border Station, which is open from 6 am to 10 pm, seven days a week. Just north of the border, the highway splits into two roads {{to pass through the}} customs checkpoints before the two roads merge back together; <b>the</b> <b>fork</b> to the west is for cars, and <b>the</b> <b>fork</b> to the east is for {{commercial}} vehicles. SR 7 takes the western fork, which passes over the other fork at the northern end and merges into that highway. From here to I-8, SR 7 is an expressway known as Orchard Road. Before reaching I-8, SR 7 travels north and has an at-grade intersection with SR 98 and a few other roads. At its northern end, SR 7 turns into County Route S32 (still Orchard Road) as it intersects with I-8. The entire route runs through the Sonoran Desert and is built to expressway standards.|$|E
25|$|The Trinity River {{has four}} branches: <b>the</b> West <b>Fork,</b> <b>the</b> Clear <b>Fork,</b> <b>the</b> Elm <b>Fork,</b> and <b>the</b> East <b>Fork.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} full service {{restaurants}} in <b>the</b> <b>Forks</b> Market: Sushi Train at <b>The</b> <b>Forks,</b> Sydney's at <b>The</b> <b>Forks,</b> <b>The</b> Beachcomber & Ba Ja Beach Club, and The Original Pancake House. There {{is also a}} food court and numerous quick service food vendors.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> North <b>Fork</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Forked</b> Deer River {{is formed}} in Gibson County {{to the south}} of Chapel Hill Road near Medina and flows to the {{northwest}} before entering Dyer County. Here it accepts the flow from <b>the</b> Middle <b>Fork</b> and then joins with <b>the</b> South <b>Fork</b> to form <b>the</b> <b>Forked</b> Deer River.|$|R
5|$|After leaving Rogers County, {{the next}} county along US-412 is Mayes County. South of Chouteau, the route {{provides}} access to US-69 via an interchange. Just west of US-412's crossing of the Grand River, the highway intersects SH-412B, which connects US-412 to SH-69A. After crossing the river, US-412 comes to {{a fork in the}} road; one half of <b>the</b> <b>fork</b> is the Cherokee Turnpike, which mainline US-412 follows, while the other is US-412 Alternate, which runs parallel to the turnpike on an old alignment of US-412.|$|E
5|$|Highway72 {{was built}} as a trunk route by 1920, and became a provincial highway in 1937. It has {{remained}} largely unchanged since then, aside from the reconstruction and realignment of the Frog Rapids bridge, and the renumbering of <b>the</b> <b>fork</b> towards Hudson as Highway664. The length of the highway is , the entirety of which is situated in Kenora District. There are no significant settlements between its endpoints.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, SR 4 was re-routed to {{go further}} south to bypass Oakley and Brentwood. The {{southern}} end of SR 160 was then extended south to cover {{the part of the}} freeway that is no longer designated as SR 4, from Main Street (where State Route 4 originally exited the freeway) to <b>the</b> <b>fork</b> of the new SR 4 (formerly known as the State Route 4 Bypass, or Bypass Road).|$|E
50|$|Canada Day at <b>the</b> <b>Forks</b> is an all day event, with {{activities}} happening throughout <b>the</b> <b>Forks</b> grounds, and {{culminating in a}} fireworks show.|$|R
2500|$|The Lewis River below <b>the</b> <b>forks</b> was {{generally}} 400 to 600 feet wide, narrowing to 200 feet at <b>the</b> <b>forks.</b> [...] On <b>the</b> East <b>Fork</b> up to La Center, {{the river was}} 150 to 200 feet wide.|$|R
50|$|Located {{directly}} in between <b>the</b> <b>Forks</b> Market, and Johnston Terminal, <b>the</b> <b>Forks</b> Market Plaza features fountains, canopies, dancing programs, several open performance spaces and patios.|$|R
5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, <b>the</b> <b>fork,</b> and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the steering mechanism is in front of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E
5|$|During the Sun Dance, {{which is}} practiced by many Plains Indian tribes, the eagle is {{represented}} in several ways. The eagle nest is represented by <b>the</b> <b>fork</b> of the lodge where the dance is held. A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used {{during the course of}} the dance. Also during the dance, a medicine man may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who seek to be healed. The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that the eagle may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator.|$|E
5|$|Located on {{the western}} banks of the north-flowing Red River of the North, in a flat region known as the Red River Valley, the city is prone to flooding. The Red River Flood of 1997 devastated the city. Originally called Les Grandes Fourches by French fur traders from Canada, who had long worked and lived in the region, {{steamboat}} captain Alexander Griggs platted a community after being forced to winter there. The Grand Forks post office was established in 1870; and the town was incorporated on February 22, 1881. The city was named for its location at <b>the</b> <b>fork</b> of the Red River and the Red Lake River.|$|E
2500|$|Over 50 {{separate}} projects involving excavation {{have been}} undertaken at <b>the</b> <b>Forks</b> since 1950, enabling researchers {{to provide an}} accurate reflection of the various uses of <b>the</b> <b>Forks</b> over <b>the</b> past 6000 years. [...] Despite the concerns stated above, none of these projects indicate that <b>the</b> <b>Forks</b> site was ever used as a burial ground.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Glady <b>Fork</b> is a {{tributary}} of the Dry Fork; via <b>the</b> Dry <b>Fork,</b> <b>the</b> Black <b>Fork,</b> and <b>the</b> Cheat, Monongahela and Ohio rivers, {{it is part of the}} watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of 64 sq mi in the Allegheny Mountains. With <b>the</b> Dry <b>Fork,</b> <b>the</b> Laurel <b>Fork,</b> <b>the</b> Shavers <b>Fork</b> and <b>the</b> Blackwater River, it is considered one of the five principal headwaters tributaries of the Cheat. [...] The stream was named for the presence of glades along the river.|$|R

5|$|Male mole crickets sing by stridulating, always underground. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa {{the song}} {{is based on an}} almost pure tone at 3.5 kiloHertz, loud enough to make the ground vibrate 20cm all round the burrow; in fact {{the song is}} unique in each species. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa the burrow is {{somewhat}} roughly sculpted; in Gryllotalpa vineae, the burrow is smooth and carefully shaped, with no irregularities larger than 1 millimetre. In both species the burrow {{takes the form of a}} double exponential horn with twin openings at the soil surface; at the other end there is a constriction, then a resonating bulb, and then an escape tunnel. A burrow is used for at least a week. The male positions himself head down with his head in the bulb, his tail near <b>the</b> <b>fork</b> in the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is in spring. During {{the beginning of}} the {{breeding season}}, courting pairs soar high together and one or both may make steep spiralling or swooping dives. The birds are monogamous and pair bonds may be maintained for more than one breeding season and the same nest sites may be reused each year. The nest is an untidy platform of twigs lined with rags and placed on a cliff ledge, building, or <b>the</b> <b>fork</b> of a large tree. Old nest platforms of eagles may also be taken over. Nests placed on the ground are rare but have been recorded in subspecies N. p. ginginianus and N. p. majorensis.|$|E
5|$|Young {{birds have}} a yellowish-red gape. The feather follicles {{appear on the}} fourth day and pin {{feathers}} emerge after a week. Nestlings increase in weight steadily until they are 12 days old. The eyes open on the eighth day, the iris reddish-black while the gape turns red. The young leave the nest after about 16 to 20 days after hatching. They do not have <b>the</b> <b>fork</b> in the tail until three weeks. The parents continue to feed and protect them for a month. Young birds may beg for food for longer, but are often ignored or chased away by the adults. Birds reach breeding condition in about two years.|$|E
50|$|Shannon {{got lost}} again August 6, 1805, when the {{expedition}} was at <b>the</b> Three <b>Forks.</b> He was dispatched up a <b>fork</b> <b>the</b> party had named Wisdom (<b>the</b> middle <b>fork</b> was named Jefferson and <b>the</b> placid <b>fork,</b> Philanthropy). He rejoined the party {{after three days}} by backtracking to <b>the</b> <b>forks</b> and following <b>the</b> trail of the others.|$|R
2500|$|The Sabine {{rises in}} {{northeast}} Texas by {{the union of}} three branches: <b>the</b> Cowleech <b>Fork,</b> Caddo Fork, and South <b>Fork.</b> <b>The</b> Cowleech <b>Fork</b> rises in northwestern Hunt County and flows southeast for [...] <b>The</b> Caddo <b>Fork,</b> shown as [...] "Caddo Creek" [...] on federal maps, rises in two tributary <b>forks,</b> <b>the</b> East Caddo <b>Fork</b> and <b>the</b> West Caddo <b>Fork,</b> in northwestern Hunt County. <b>The</b> South <b>Fork</b> rises in <b>the</b> southwestern corner of Hunt County and flows east for , joining <b>the</b> Caddo <b>Fork</b> and Cowleech Fork in southeastern Hunt County. The confluence of <b>the</b> <b>forks</b> is now submerged in the Lake Tawakoni reservoir. The combined river flows southeast across northeast Texas and is joined by a fourth branch, Lake Fork Creek, [...] downstream from the reservoir.|$|R
50|$|The river {{has three}} forks: <b>the</b> South <b>Fork,</b> Wheatfield <b>Fork</b> and <b>the</b> North <b>Fork.</b> <b>The</b> South <b>Fork</b> is <b>the</b> longest and travels northwest, {{parallel}} to the coast along the San Andreas Fault rift zone. <b>The</b> Wheatfield <b>Fork</b> begins west of Lake Sonoma and has the largest flow of <b>the</b> three <b>forks.</b> Its tributaries include Tombs, Wolf, House, Haupt and Fuller creeks. Wheatfield is <b>the</b> first <b>fork</b> to combine with <b>the</b> South <b>Fork.</b> Buckeye Creek, {{a tributary of the}} river, joins <b>the</b> South <b>Fork</b> next. It is followed by Rockpile Creek and Big Pepperwod Creek. <b>The</b> North <b>Fork</b> is <b>the</b> only part of the river in Mendocino County. It travels roughly southwest towards the coast along the San Andreas Fault rift zone and meets <b>the</b> South <b>Fork</b> at <b>the</b> border between the counties, a few miles before the river flows into the ocean.|$|R
5|$|CR106 {{originated}} in 1824, when {{the road was}} chartered for the New Turnpike and headed from Monroe to Haverstraw. Back in the 1820s, what is now Southfields was known as Monroe. The New Turnpike started at a nail factory in Monroe to a crossing over the Ramapo River, and progressed eastward, passing Lake Stahahe (then known as Car Pond). The turnpike continued eastward, meeting the Old Turnpike at {{a fork in the}} road. At <b>the</b> <b>fork,</b> part of the road became NY210 in the 1930 New York State Route renumbering. In 1910, when the park opened, the road became known as the Southfields Road. Three years later, it became part of the Seven Lakes Drive. Three more years later, the route became known as County Highway416. In 1919 and 1920, the western section of the road was reconstructed. After a bridge was built to cross a river in 1923, a new route, making up part of the original Warwick Turnpike, became NY17A.|$|E
5|$|Marco Pesenti Gritti, the {{initiator}} of Galeon, {{originally developed}} Epiphany in 2002 as a fork of Galeon. <b>The</b> <b>fork</b> occurred {{because of the}} divergent aims of Gritti {{and the rest of}} Galeon development team about new features. While Gritti regarded Galeon's monolithic design and the number of user-configurable features as factors limiting Galeon's maintainability and user base expansion, the rest of the Galeon developers wanted to see more features added. At the same time the GNOME project created the GNOME human interface guidelines, which promoted simplification of user interfaces. As Galeon was oriented towards power users, most developers saw the implementation of those guidelines as unacceptable. As a result, Gritti created a new browser based on Galeon's codebase, with most of the non-mission-critical features removed. He intended Epiphany to comply fully with the GNOME human interface guidelines, with a very simple user-interface. As such, Epiphany does not have its own theme settings and uses GNOME's settings, which are specified in the GNOME Control Center.|$|E
5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{probably}} breeds {{throughout its}} range. The breeding season is from June to January, {{with one or}} two broods raised during this time. The nest is an untidy deep bowl of sticks and bits of bark in <b>the</b> <b>fork</b> of a tree, Staghorn or bird's nest ferns, or grasstree. Pandanus palms are a popular nest site in Mackay. They often renovate and use the old nests of other species, most commonly the grey-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis), but also the chestnut-crowned babbler (P. ruficeps), other honeyeaters including noisy (Philemon corniculatus), little and silver-crowned friarbirds (P. argenticeps), the noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala) and the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), and artamids such as the Australian magpie and butcherbird species, and even the magpie-lark. In Coen, an old babbler nest in a paperbark (Melaleuca) which had been lined with messmate bark had been occupied by blue-faced honeyeaters and re-lined with strips of paperbark. Two or rarely three eggs are laid, 22 × 32mm (1 × 1⅓ in) and buff-pink splotched with red-brown or purplish colours. The female alone incubates the eggs, over a period of 16 or 17 days.|$|E
50|$|Both <b>the</b> Middle <b>Fork</b> and Main <b>Fork</b> {{travel through}} <b>the</b> Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Area. <b>The</b> Middle <b>Fork</b> is about 110 mi long, while <b>the</b> Main <b>Fork</b> is about 81 mi in length. <b>The</b> Middle <b>Fork</b> raft trip run ends 7 mi {{prior to the}} {{beginning}} of <b>the</b> Main <b>Fork</b> run; Corn Creek is the start of <b>the</b> Main <b>Fork</b> section of <b>the</b> Salmon River.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Forks</b> {{is home to}} the 1999 Pan Am Games Monument. Located {{beside the}} Inn at <b>the</b> <b>Forks,</b> <b>the</b> {{monument}} recognizes the governments, companies and individuals who supported the 1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg. The monument served as the flame cauldron for the games.|$|R
5000|$|The Saline River {{begins in}} the eastern foothills of the Ouachita Mountains in Saline and Garland {{counties}} {{and is one of}} the last free-flowing rivers in the Ouachita River Basin. The river has four headwater tributaries, <b>the</b> South <b>Fork,</b> <b>the</b> Middle <b>Fork,</b> <b>the</b> Alum <b>Fork,</b> and <b>the</b> North <b>Fork,</b> which merge north of the city of Benton.|$|R
5|$|Across {{most of its}} range, the pied butcherbird can {{generally}} be found breeding from winter to summer; eggs are laid anywhere from July to December, but mostly from September to November, and young can {{be present in the}} nest from August till February. There are reports of breeding outside these months, however. The nest is constructed of dry sticks with a finer material such as dried grass, black roly poly (Sclerolaena muricata), bark and leaves forming a cup-shaped interior. It is located in <b>the</b> <b>fork</b> of a tree, often among foliage and inconspicuous. The clutch consists of two to five (most commonly three or four) oval eggs blotched with brown over a base colour of various shades of pale greyish- or brownish-green. Larger clutches have been recorded, such as at Jandowae in Queensland, where two pairs laid eggs and were sharing incubation duties. Eggs of subspecies nigrogularis are larger, at around 33mm long by 24mm (1.3 by 0.95in) wide, while those of subspecies picatus are around 31mm long by 22mm (1.2 by 0.85in) wide. Incubation takes 19 to 21 days, with the eggs laid up to 48 hours apart and hatching at a similar interval. Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial—they are born naked or sparsely covered in down and blind. They spend anywhere from 25 to 33 days in the nest before fledging, though may leave the nest early if disturbed. They are fed by parents and helper birds. Brood parasites recorded include the pallid cuckoo (Cacomantis pallidus) and channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae).|$|E
25|$|The two rear {{dropouts}} (which {{join the}} seat stays to the chain stays, {{and hold the}} axle of the rear wheel) may have integral lugs in some designs. <b>The</b> <b>fork</b> dropout or ends may be joined to <b>the</b> <b>fork</b> blades using a similar method as well. <b>The</b> <b>fork</b> crown, which joins the steering tube to <b>the</b> <b>fork</b> blades, may have either an external or internal socket design.|$|E
25|$|The {{cartridge}} {{front fork}} used in Guzzi's motorcycles {{of the later}} 1970s and 1980s is a Guzzi invention. Instead of containing the damping oil in <b>the</b> <b>fork,</b> {{it is in a}} cartridge. Oil in <b>the</b> <b>fork</b> is purely for lubrication.|$|E
5000|$|The Sabine {{rises in}} {{northeast}} Texas by {{the union of}} three branches: <b>the</b> Cowleech <b>Fork,</b> Caddo Fork, and South <b>Fork.</b> <b>The</b> Cowleech <b>Fork</b> rises in northwestern Hunt County and flows southeast for 49.2 mi. <b>The</b> Caddo <b>Fork,</b> shown as [...] "Caddo Creek" [...] on federal maps, rises in two tributary <b>forks,</b> <b>the</b> East Caddo <b>Fork</b> and <b>the</b> West Caddo <b>Fork,</b> in northwestern Hunt County. <b>The</b> South <b>Fork</b> rises in <b>the</b> southwestern corner of Hunt County and flows east for 28.3 mi, joining <b>the</b> Caddo <b>Fork</b> and Cowleech Fork in southeastern Hunt County. The confluence of <b>the</b> <b>forks</b> is now submerged in the Lake Tawakoni reservoir.
