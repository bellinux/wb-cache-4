50|$|Manufacturing {{companies}} often {{refer to}} their manufacturing plant transfer, consolidation and closure activities as physical restructuring. This {{can be done}} by moving production or services overseas, a process known as offshoring. Such projects began in the United States during the 1960s and by 2009 had showed little sign of having ended. Such corporate behavior has taken its <b>toll</b> on the <b>manufacturing</b> base and continues to do so.|$|R
50|$|The size {{ranged from}} small {{mom and pop}} {{companies}} run by {{a husband and wife}} team, to large independent companies, such as GTE, Theodore Gary & Company, United Telecom, ConTel and Centel, which resembled the Bell system with vertical integration. GTE was the largest non-RBOC domestic telephone company, and included local operating companies, long line (<b>toll)</b> companies and <b>manufacturing</b> companies. A small mom and pop company might have had the husband doing the outside lines work and the wife operating a manual switchboard. Later these small companies would have a Class 5 telephone switch providing local automatic service. Much of this equipment was manufactured by the Automatic Electric Company, Stromberg-Carlson, and the Kellogg Switchboard & Supply Company.|$|R

40|$|A {{pharmaceutical}} company at Jakarta developed a generic meropenem sterile dosage form by <b>toll</b> <b>manufacturing</b> business cooperation with another {{pharmaceutical company}}. During {{the process of}} partner selection, {{there was a time}} delay. The target plan was 4 months but in reality it took 12 months. This research evaluates factors which cause the time delay. One of the causes was the unavailability of pre-selection model. This research test a qualitative pre-selection model using variables of management, availability oftransport choices, value added services, rate profile and quality services, service characteristics and performance measurements. The six variables described into 36 dimensions and indicators. The model tested to 10 pharmaceutical companies with sterile production facility needed for production of meropenem sterile dosage form. Research method used is qualitative descriptive analysis with searching data method through observational study. The data source is secondary data. Based on the research result, timedelay was caused by several factors related to product, procedure, quality and fee. The tested pre-selection model can be used as an alternative solution to avoid future time delay in <b>toll</b> <b>manufacturing</b> partner selection...|$|E
50|$|With {{the number}} of small independents having diminished {{considerably}} by 1970, Continental's pace in acquiring telephone operating companies was reduced. Continental sold its cable television business in 1971, and after a sluggish economy had taken its <b>toll</b> on Continental's <b>manufacturing</b> and supply subsidiaries, those, too, were sold in 1976. Maguire resigned in 1976 because of health problems and was succeeded as president by James V. Napier, a former executive vice-president. That same year, Continental became the first telephone company outside the Bell system to install a digital telephone switching system, a move that provided improved network operating efficiency, allowed {{the introduction of new}} calling features, and started the transition away from operations dominated by rural service areas.|$|R
40|$|There is a {{wide range}} of {{applications}} for 3 D printing technology with an additive manufacturing such as aerospace, automotive, marine and oil/gas, medical, consumer, electronics, building construction, and many others. There have been many pros and cons for 3 D additive manufacturing. Even though 3 D printing technology has many advantages: freedom to design and innovate without penalties, rapid iteration through design permutations, excellence mass customization, elimination of <b>tolling,</b> green <b>manufacturing,</b> minimal material wastes, energy efficiency, an enablement of personalized manufacturing. 3 D additive manufacturing still has many disadvantages: unexpected pre- and post-processing requirement, high-end manufacturing, low speed for mass production, high thermal residual stress, and poor surface finish and dimensional accuracy, and many others. Especially, the issues for 3 D additive manufacturing are on high cost for process and equipment for high-end manufacturing, low speed for mass production, high thermal residual stress, and poor surface finish and dimensional accuracy. In particular, it is relatively challenging to produce casting products with lattice or honeycomb shapes having sophisticated geometries. In spite of the scalable potential of periodic cellular metals to structural applications, the manufacturing methods of I∙AM Casting have been not actively explored nor fully understood. A few qualitative studies of I∙AM Casting has been reported. Recently, a sand casting of cellular structures was attempted, resulting in casting porosity and the sharp corners in the lattice structure of the cellular structural molds, a sharpness which prevent fluid-flow and causes undesired solidification, resulting in misrun casting defects. Research on the indirect AM methods has not been aggressively conducted due to the highly complex and multidisciplinary problems across the process – continuum modeling (thermal stress, flow, heat transfer, and water diffusion) with multiple materials (polymer, metals, and ceramic) for multiphase simulations – solid, liquid, and gas. As an initial step to fully understand the processing of I∙AM Casting, a quantitative study on I∙AM Casting is conducted in this work...|$|R
40|$|PT XYZ {{received}} {{an offer of}} <b>toll</b> <b>manufacturing</b> services from its client as much as 360 units at a price of Rp 14. 000 for four years. To be able to fulfill the offer, the company must issue an investment of Rp 1, 3 billion for the plant expansion regarding to the limited capacity and specificity of the engine that must be purchased separately. There is also some additional operational cost for the company. Based on the analysis of costvolume-profit (CVP) the company realized that the price offered is far below the desired corporate profit by 27 % so that the new price agreed upon in the negotiation is Rp 16. 000.

40|$|What {{is unique}} in terms of “trusted digital preservation” in the {{pharmaceutical}} industry? What are the specific legal and regulatory requirements {{and what are the}} typical types of data concerned in the core business processes of research, development and manufacturing? Life science is a “high-risk industry”. While products are targeted to treat illness and prolong lives they can also be life-threatening if used wrongly. In order to gain approval for marketing authorizations, terabytes of data and documentation are being generated to prove efficacy and safety of a compound. This data will be subject to regulatory review before an approval is granted. Global Good Practice and resulting national regulations require the retention of vital data up to several generations of software and hardware. This paper discusses some of these problems, drawing on the experience of building practical solutions {{in the context of an}} example in the area of registration documentation. Data in Pharmaceutical Industry The life cycle of a typical pharmaceutical product spans over several decades from first discovery through development to marketing authorization and distribution until the product is withdrawn from the market. Even after decades old compounds may be rediscovered for use in new indications. In addition, during the life time of a compound, terabytes of data and resulting documentation (records) are being generated to support the marketing authorization and further extensions to this authorization. Multiple partners are normally included in the development of a drug including third parties. An actual discovery may have happened in a small biotech company or university off-spring, development activities are then spread over several Contract Research Organizations (CROs), while the marketing may be shared by two Pharma companies and production could be done as <b>toll</b> <b>manufacturing.</b> This shows how broad the variety of sources and originators of data production may be, indicating potential issues of custody and management of data ownership through time. Not less is the variety of types of data which are generated by very specific (and often proprietary) systems and high tech equipment...|$|E
