5|$|Hobbs {{joined the}} Corps in October 1916 as an air {{mechanic}} and after training was posted to London, then Norfolk; {{at first he}} had time to appear in charity cricket matches and in several games for Idle. In November 1917, he joined 110 Squadron which remained in England despite plans <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> France. By 1918, the cricket authorities began to arrange more matches and Hobbs played successfully several times at Lord's. In September 1918, 110 Squadron, as part of the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF), was sent to France and took an active part in the fighting, but Hobbs never discussed his career in the RAF. Even so, some of his family remained critical and felt that the worst of the war was over when Hobbs went to France. He was demobilised in February 1919.|$|E
5|$|In the 1999 Memorial Cup, the Hitmen {{opened their}} tournament with a 5–3 {{victory over the}} Ontario Hockey League's Belleville Bulls, {{followed}} by a 4–3 loss to the host Ottawa 67's. They followed with a 3–1 win over the Acadie-Bathurst Titan of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. Finishing atop the round robin standings, the Hitmen earned a bye into the championship game, and a rematch against the 67's. The championship game was a back-and-forth affair. Ottawa held 4–1 and 6–5 leads, while Calgary led 5–4 at one point and tied the game late <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> overtime. The Hitmen fell short of winning the title however, as Ottawa's Matt Zultek scored the winning goal 1:58 into overtime. Brendl and Matt Kinch were named to the Memorial Cup All-Star team.|$|E
5|$|Pogba {{made his}} debut with the under-19 team {{in its first}} match of the season against Italy on 6 September 2011. In the match, he {{assisted}} on two goals, scored by Jean-Christophe Bahebeck and Anthony Koura, in a 3–1 victory. On 29 February 2012, he scored his first goal for the team in a 2–1 defeat to Spain. In Elite Round qualification for the 2012 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship, Pogba scored the fifth goal in the team's 6–0 rout of the Netherlands. The victory qualified France for the competition. On 11 June 2012, Pogba {{was named to the}} squad to participate in the tournament. In the team's opening group stage match against Serbia, he converted a penalty in a 3–0 win. France reached the semi-finals where the team faced Spain. In the match, with France trailing 3–2 in extra time, Pogba scored the equalizing goal three minutes prior to the match's completion <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> penalties. However, despite Pogba converting the opening penalty for France, Les Bleuets were defeated 4–2.|$|E

5|$|At 00:30 on 11 February the {{explosives}} were detonated {{and the western}} pier destroyed, causing the aqueduct to crumble and effectively break in half, and the Ginestra bridge was also successfully destroyed. Leaving one man who had broken his ankle when he had landed with a nearby farmer, {{the remainder of the}} Troop withdrew from the area at 01:00, splitting into three groups and heading towards the coast. The three groups moved as fast as possible towards the coast, but were all captured within a few hours of the aqueduct being demolished. The group commanded by Major Pritchard was spotted by a farmer who raised the alarm at a nearby village, leading to a local carabinieri unit surrounding the group; with little ammunition and heavily outnumbered, Pritchard decided to surrender. The other three groups, including the six sappers who had landed two miles from the objective, fared little better. The two groups from the aqueduct were soon located by Italian soldiers and ambushed, forcing them to surrender after brief firefights. The third group were found by a group of civilians as they moved towards the coast; after attempting to bluff their way past by claiming to be German soldiers on a special field exercise, which failed when the local Mayor demanded identity papers, they were captured by carabinieri. All were stripped of their weapons and equipment and transported to Naples, {{with the exception of the}} Italian translator, Picchi; he was handed over to the Blackshirts, a Fascist paramilitary group, who tortured and then executed him. Even if any of the groups had managed to make their way to the coast and the rendezvous point, they would not have been picked up by HMS Triumph. One of the two Whitleys conducting the diversionary raid at Foggia suffered engine trouble after bombing the railway yards. The pilot radioed Malta, informing his airfield that he was ditching in the mouth of the River Sele, coincidentally the area where the rendezvous was to occur. Fearing that the message had been monitored by the Italians and that the submarine might sail into a trap, the decision was made by senior officers not <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the rendezvous point.|$|E

Édouard’s father, Gaspard, travelled by train to Winnipeg {{with the intention of}} bringing his body to Willow Bunch for burial. However, when he was told he needed a double fare, he realized he did not have enough money to do so. As a result, Édouard’s family eventually assumed that his body was buried somewhere in St. Louis.|$|E

Mahnmut's submersible is named The Dark Lady, an allusion to a figure in Shakespeare's sonnets. There is also, of course, The Tempests presence in the characters of Prospero, Ariel and Caliban. There are also multiple references to other Shakespeare works and characters such as Falstaff, Henry IV, Part I and Twelfth Night. Shakespeare himself even makes an appearance in a dream to Mahnmut and quotes from Sonnet 31.|$|E

25|$|The Spurs and Heat would {{alternate}} {{wins the}} first six games in the series. In Game 6, the Spurs {{were on the verge}} of winning their fifth NBA title. San Antonio was up five points with 28 seconds to go in regulation. An unlikely and uncharacteristic series of mishaps would doom the Spurs down the stretch, including the benching of Duncan by Popovich at the end of regulation with the Spurs on defense. The Heat missed their field goal attempt, but the undersized Spurs could not grab the defensive rebound. Chris Bosh rebounded the ball and Ray Allen then hit a 3-pointer to tie the game with five seconds left in regulation <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> overtime, during which the Spurs were defeated 103–100. In Game 7, San Antonio jumped out to a lead early and kept the game close the entire way. Toward the end of the game, however, and despite a 24-point, 12 rebound effort, Duncan failed to convert on two attempts to tie the game: a missed layup and missed tip-in that allowed LeBron James to hit a jumper and increase the Heat's lead to 92–88. After a steal from Ginóbili, James hit two free throws after being fouled by Duncan, and when Ginóbili missed a subsequent 3-pointer, Dwyane Wade hit one out of two from the free throw line to put the game on ice, as the Heat would win their second straight championship.|$|E
25|$|In the Persian Empire, a {{regulated}} {{and sustainable}} tax system {{was introduced by}} Darius I the Great in 500 BC; the Persian system of taxation was tailored to each Satrapy (the area ruled by a Satrap or provincial governor). At differing times, there were between 20 and 30 Satrapies in the Empire and each was assessed according to its supposed productivity. It was {{the responsibility of the}} Satrap to collect the due amount and <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the treasury, after deducting his expenses (the expenses and the power of deciding precisely how and from whom to raise the money in the province, offer maximum opportunity for rich pickings). The quantities demanded from the various provinces gave a vivid picture of their economic potential. For instance, Babylon was assessed for the highest amount and for a startling mixture of commodities; 1,000 silver talents and four months supply of food for the army. India, a province fabled for its gold, was to supply gold dust equal in value to the very large amount of 4,680 silver talents. Egypt was known for the wealth of its crops; it was to be the granary of the Persian Empire (and, later, of the Roman Empire) and was required to provide 120,000 measures of grain in addition to 700 talents of silver. This tax was exclusively levied on Satrapies based on their lands, productive capacity and tribute levels.|$|E

50|$|Micron and Intel {{initially}} made faster SSDs {{by implementing}} data striping (similar to RAID 0) and interleaving in their architecture. This enabled {{the creation of}} ultra-fast SSDs with 250 MB/s effective read/write speeds with the SATA 3 Gbit/s interface in 2009. Two years later, SandForce continued to leverage this parallel flash connectivity, releasing consumer-grade SATA 6 Gbit/s SSD controllers which supported 500 MB/s read/write speeds. SandForce controllers compress the data prior <b>to</b> <b>sending</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the flash memory. This process may result in less writing and higher logical throughput, depending on the compressibility of the data.|$|R

The other approach is to use cryptographic techniques [9 – 12] to protect the confidentiality of the outsourced data. To provide a double layer of security, we apply both transformation and encryption techniques on the outsourced data.|$|R
25|$|Entering {{the game}} at Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium {{with the passing of}} North Carolina's legendary coach Dean Smith a couple of days before, both Duke and UNC coaches, players and staff all {{gathered}} at center court and held a moment of silence for Smith. Once the game started Duke jumped right out of the gate with an 18-6 lead early in the game thanks to hot shooting. UNC would respond by outscoring Duke 30-22 over the next several minutes of the 1st half to cut Duke's lead down to 40-36 with around 4 minutes left in the 1st half. Duke then went on a 9-0 run over the next 2 minutes to get their largest lead of {{the game at}} 49-36 with 2 minutes left in the half. UNC would score the last 6 points of the half to cut Duke's lead down to 49-42 at halftime. In the 2nd half almost everything went UNC's way as UNC started dominating the post and eventually built their largest lead of the game 77-67 over Duke with 4 minutes left in regulation to complete a 41-18 run over Duke in an 18-minute span. With Duke still trailing UNC 79-72 with around 2 1/2 minutes left in regulation Duke's Tyus Jones would help Duke finish regulation on a 9-2 run over UNC to tie the game at 81 points apiece <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> overtime. In overtime, the game was filled with missed free throws, missed shots, fouls, turnovers, lead changes and ties with Duke eventually winning the game 92-90.|$|E
