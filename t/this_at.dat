5|$|Almost {{all modern}} paleontologists agreed with Riggs {{that the two}} dinosaurs should be {{classified}} together in a single genus. According {{to the rules of}} the ICZN (which governs the scientific names of animals), the name Apatosaurus, having been published first, has priority as the official name; Brontosaurus was considered a junior synonym and was therefore long discarded from formal use. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>at</b> least one paleontologistRobert T. Bakkerargued in the 1990s that A.ajax and A.excelsus were in fact sufficiently distinct for the latter to merit a separate genus.|$|E
5|$|Amid renewed rumours of an {{impending}} Rhodesian UDI, Smith travelled to meet Wilson in London {{at the start}} of October 1965, telling the press that he intended to resolve the independence issue once and for all. Both the British and the Rhodesians were surprised by the large numbers of Britons who came out to support Smith during his visit. Smith accepted an invitation from the BBC to appear on its Twenty-Four Hours evening news and current affairs programme, but Downing Street blocked <b>this</b> <b>at</b> the last minute. Following largely abortive talks with Wilson, the Rhodesian Prime Minister flew home on 12 October. Desperate to avert UDI, Wilson travelled to Salisbury two weeks later to continue negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Avinor {{wants to}} extend most short {{airports}} to 1200 m by year 2030, {{because they see}} a lack of aircraft types which have more than 19 seats able to use 800-meter runways. Dash 8 built after 2009 can't use them. Few countries apart from Norway have such short airports. There is however no room for <b>this</b> <b>at</b> Hasvik, so the plan here and for some other airports with few passengers, is to use small planes with less than 20 seats.|$|E

5|$|If {{a seizure}} lasts longer than 5minutes {{or if there}} are more than two {{seizures}} in an hour without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for <b>this.</b> <b>At</b> home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred. If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Smith {{moved to}} MIT as an Institute Professor with {{appointments}} {{in both the}} Departments of Humanities and Metallurgy. His focus was to transplant the techniques of metallurgy into {{the study of the}} production methods used to create artefacts discovered by archaeologists such as samurai swords. In his role of teaching the history of science, he argued that important advances were often the result of curiosity rather than the pursuit of defined goals. He was interested in the scientific aspects of fine arts, and published several works linking the arts with the sciences. He lectured about <b>this</b> <b>at</b> the Smithsonian Institution's Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, DC.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{and again}} in 1970, Wilton {{recommended}} {{the creation of a}} single Defence Board of Administration, consisting of the Defence Minister, the Defence Secretary, CCOSC, and the three service chiefs, to take over the functions of the Air, Military, and Naval Boards, along with those of their separate ministers. While nothing came of <b>this</b> <b>at</b> the time, Wilton was consulted by the Labor Party prior to its reorganisation of the Defence Department, which it commenced soon after defeating the Liberals in the December 1972 Federal election. The following year, the single-service ministries were abolished in favour of an all-encompassing Department of Defence; by 1984, the CCOSC position had evolved to become the Chief of the Defence Force, directly commanding all three armed services through their respective chiefs.|$|E

5|$|In Queensland, P. fimbriata is {{reluctant}} {{to jump into the}} webs of prey spiders, while other Portia species do <b>this</b> <b>at</b> any opportunity. The Queensland orb web spider Argiope appensa shakes its web violently to shake off intruders, and P. fimbriata finds a detour that allows it to abseil on to the prey. When the web spider Zosis genicularis is busy wrapping up its own prey and is less aware of other predators, P. fimbriata uses this activity as a type of smokescreen to approach the web spider.|$|E

5|$|Other flags {{used in the}} People's Republic of China use a red {{background}} to symbolize the revolution {{in conjunction with other}} symbols. The flag of the People's Liberation Army uses the gold star with the Chinese characters 8-1 (for 1 August, the date of the PLA's founding). The flag of the Communist Party of China replaces all of the stars with the party emblem. Due to government regulations, cities and provinces of China cannot have their own flags; the only sub-national flags that exist are those of the Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>at</b> least two cities have adopted flags after the law was passed. The cities of Kaifeng and Shangrao adopted their flags in March 2006 and March 2009 respectively. This implies that the law is either repealed or not enforced.|$|E

5|$|Since many {{remains of}} each species of mammoth are known from several localities, it is {{possible}} to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus through morphological studies. Mammoth species can be identified from the number of enamel ridges (or lamellar plates) on their molars: primitive species had few ridges, and the number increased gradually as new species evolved to feed on more abrasive food items. The crowns of the teeth became deeper in height and the skulls became taller to accommodate <b>this.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, the skulls became shorter from front to back to reduce the weight of the head. The short, tall skulls of woolly and Columbian mammoths are the culmination of this process.|$|E
5|$|Some {{historian}}s opine that Hitler {{would have}} assumed Stefanie was of Jewish origin. American historian Graeme Donald believes Hitler would have inferred {{that she was}} Jewish, but saw no problems with <b>this</b> <b>at</b> the time. This view is supported by German historian Anton Joachimsthaler, who stated in a BBC interview that Hitler must have assumed she was Jewish because of her Jewish surname. British singer-songwriter, author, journalist and paranormal researcher Paul Roland wrote in his book Nazi Women that it didn't make the slightest difference to Hitler whether she was Jewish or not.|$|E

5|$|The {{companion}} {{which is}} supposed to have spun-up PSR B1937+21 is no longer present, making it one of few millisecond pulsars which does not have a stellar mass companion. The generally high occurrence of companions to millisecond pulsars is to be expected, considering a companion is necessary to spin-up millisecond pulsars to their short periods. However, millisecond pulsars do not actively accrete matter from a companion, but instead need to have only done <b>this</b> <b>at</b> some time in the past, and thus the lack of companion for PSR B1937+21 is not seen as a being in disagreement with the spin-up model. Possible mechanisms for creating isolated millisecond pulsars include evaporation of the donor star or tidal disruption of the system.|$|E

5|$|The film marked {{something}} of an {{end of an era}} for its creator.

His prediction proved quite accurate. Beginning in the late 1950s, television began increasingly to dominate the leisure time of the formerly large and loyal Japanese cinema audience. And as film company revenues dropped, so did their appetite for risk—particularly the risk represented by Kurosawa's costly production methods.|$|E
