5|$|Because {{the most}} {{circulated}} coins in the United States {{at the time}} were Spanish currency, Hamilton proposed that minting a United States dollar weighing almost as much as the Spanish peso would be <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> <b>way</b> to introduce a national currency. Hamilton differed from European monetary policymakers in his desire to overprice gold relative to silver, {{on the grounds that the}} United States would always receive an influx of silver from the West Indies. Despite his own preference for a monometallic gold standard, he ultimately issued a bimetallic currency at a fixed 15:1 ratio of silver to gold.|$|E
5|$|Another {{meeting on}} the issue was called on 6 December 1966, {{attended}} by Johnson, McNamara, the deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance, Walt Rostow of the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Joint Chiefs. Rostow took {{the side of the}} JCS and it appeared that development would start. However, McNamara once again outlined the problems and stated that <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> <b>way</b> to close the ABM gap was to simply build more ICBMs, rendering the Soviet system impotent and a great waste of money. He then proposed that the money sidelined by Congress for deployment be used for initial deployment studies while the US attempted to negotiate an arms limitation treaty. Johnson agreed with this compromise, and ordered Secretary of State Dean Rusk to open negotiations with the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>simplest</b> <b>way</b> to gain {{information}} about brain anatomy is by visual inspection, but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed. Brain tissue {{in its natural}} state is too soft to work with, {{but it can be}} hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives, and then sliced apart for examination of the interior. Visually, the interior of the brain consists of areas of so-called grey matter, with a dark color, separated by areas of white matter, with a lighter color. Further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations. It is also possible to examine the microstructure of brain tissue using a microscope, and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another.|$|E

Shane Claiborne {{and five other}} Eastern University graduates founded the community when they moved into a terraced house {{in the neighborhood of}} Kensington in January 1998. They purposely started the community in the poorest area of the city, which was a place where there were no existing local churches. They did not apply for funding from mission agencies. Members of <b>The</b> <b>Simple</b> <b>Way</b> participate in a variety of activities, including planting gardens, running a store, and feeding people who are hungry. When a law was passed that prohibited distribution of food on streets in <b>the</b> city, <b>The</b> <b>Simple</b> <b>Way</b> avoided breaking <b>the</b> new law by instead distributing the Eucharist, which is not considered food after it has been blessed. The community is part of the New Monasticism movement.|$|R

25|$|Making {{matters worse}} was the continual {{increase}} in ICBM numbers. Even before the systems {{were ready for}} use, the number of interceptor missiles needed to effectively deter an attack kept increasing. As the ABM systems were expensive, it appeared <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> <b>way</b> to defeat them was to simply make more ICBMs and deliberately start an arms race the defender could not win. The introduction of MIRV systems dramatically upset this in the favour of the attack; missiles now carried several warheads that would be dispersed over wide areas, so now every new ICBM built would require a small fleet of ABMs to counter it. Both the US and USSR rushed to introduce new weapons with MIRV systems, {{and the number of}} warheads in the world rapidly proliferated.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>simplest</b> <b>way</b> to list {{candidates}} on a ballot paper is alphabetically, {{though they may}} also be grouped by party. However, any fixed ordering will give some candidates an unfair advantage, because some voters, consciously or otherwise, are influenced in their ordering of candidates by the order found on the ballot paper. For example, studies conducted in the Republic of Ireland, where candidates are listed alphabetically, have shown that candidates whose surnames begin with an early letter in the alphabet enjoy a small electoral advantage over candidates with later letters. To solve this problem some systems involve a random ordering of candidates, or an ordering that changes from one ballot paper to another (the latter is often called the Robson rotation, after Neil Robson, a Tasmanian MHA who championed such a system).|$|E
25|$|The only {{remedy for}} {{this loss of}} control is to desaturate the CMGs by {{removing}} the excess angular momentum from the spacecraft. <b>The</b> <b>simplest</b> <b>way</b> of doing this is to use Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters. In our example of saturation along the forward axis, the RCS will be fired to produce an anticlockwise torque about that axis. The CMG control program will then command the rotor spin axes to begin fanning out away from the forward direction, producing gyroscopic torques whose resultant is clockwise about the forward direction, opposing the RCS {{as long as it}} is still firing and holding the spacecraft steady. This is continued until a suitable amount of forward angular momentum has been drained out of the CMG rotors; it is transformed into the moment of momentum of the moving matter in the RCS thruster exhausts and carried away from the spacecraft.|$|E

25|$|This {{approach}} requires building {{a model of}} the underlying index, i.e. the one upon which the derivative value is determined (for example monthly/seasonal cumulative heating degree days). <b>The</b> <b>simplest</b> <b>way</b> to model the index is just to model the distribution of historical index outcomes. We can adopt parametric or non-parametric distributions. For monthly cooling and heating degree days, assuming a normal distribution is usually warranted. The predictive power of such a model is rather limited. A better result can be obtained by modelling the index generating process on a finer scale. In the case of temperature contracts, {{a model of the}} daily average (or min and max) temperature time series can be built. The daily temperature (or rain, snow, wind, etc.) model can be built using common statistical time series models (i.e. ARMA or Fourier transform in the frequency domain) purely based only on the features displayed in the historical time series of the index. A more sophisticated approach is to incorporate some physical intuition/relationships into our statistical models based on spatial and temporal correlation between weather occurring {{in various parts of the}} ocean-atmosphere system around the world (for example, we can incorporate the effects of El Niño on temperatures and rainfall).|$|E
25|$|Spiritual, emotional, and {{mathematical}} intellectuality, too, {{is behind the}} family group of Archipenko. This group, in plaster, might have been made of dough. It represents a featureless, large, strong male—one gets the impression of strength from humps and lumps—an impression of a female, less vivid, and the vague knowledge that a child is mixed up in the general embrace. The faces are rather blocky, the whole group with arms intertwined—arms that end suddenly, no hands, might be the sketch of a sculpture to be. But when one gets an insight it is intensely more interesting. It is, eventually, clear that in portraying his idea of family love the sculptor has built his figures with pyramidal strength; they are grafted together with love and geometric design, their limbs are bracings, ties of strength, they represent, not individuals, but the structure itself of family life. Not family life as one sees it, but the unseen, the deep emotional unseen, and in making his group when the sculptor found himself verging upon the seen—that is, when he no longer felt the unseen—he stopped. Therefore the hands were not essential. And this expression is made in <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> <b>way.</b> Some will hoot at it, but others will feel the respect that is due one who simplifies and expresses the deep things of life. You may say that such is literature in marble—well, {{it is the most}} modern sculpture.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the end of}} the Battle of Britain, Newall {{was quickly}} forced into {{retirement}} and replaced as Chief of the Air Staff by Sir Charles Portal. Contemporaries attributed this to the effects of overwork, which had certainly taken its toll, but there were also other aspects; Newall had lost political support, particularly following a dispute with Lord Beaverbrook over the control of aircraft production and repair. Matters came to a head with the circulation of an anonymous memo attacking Newall, among other senior officers, as [...] "a real weakness to the RAF and to the nation's defences". The author was Edgar McCloughry, a disaffected staff officer who saw himself as passed over for promotion and who had been brought into Beaverbrook's inner circle. Beaverbrook pressed Churchill to dismiss Newall, gaining the support of influential ex-RAF figures such as Trenchard and Salmond. Trenchard had come out against Newall for his failure to launch a decisive strategic bombing offensive, while Salmond saw Newall's removal as <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> <b>way</b> to replace Dowding as head of Fighter Command – despite Newall having also sought to sack Dowding.|$|E
