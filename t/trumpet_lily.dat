40|$|It is {{well known}} that a tip-focused {{intracellular}} Ca 2 + gradient and the meshwork of short actin filaments at the tip region are necessary for pollen tube growth. However, {{little is known about the}} connections between the two factors. Here, a novel Ca 2 +-dependent actin-binding protein with molecular mass of 41 kD from lily (Lilium davidii) pollen (LdABP 41) was isolated and purified with DNase I chromatography. Our purification procedure yielded about 0. 6 mg of LdABP 41 with > 98 % purity from 10 g of lily pollen. At least two isoforms with isoelectric points of 5. 8 and 6. 0 were detected on two-dimensional gels. The results of N-terminal sequencing and mass-spectrometry analysis of LdABP 41 showed that both isoforms shared substantial similarity with <b>trumpet</b> <b>lily</b> (Lilium longiflorum) villin and other members of the gelsolin superfamily. Negative-stained electron microscope images showed that LdABP 41 severed in vitro-polymerized lily pollen F-actin into short actin filaments in a Ca 2 +-sensitive manner. Microinjection of the anti-LdABP 41 antibody into germinated lily pollen demonstrated that the protein was required for pollen tube growth. The results of immunolocalization of the protein showed that it existed in the cytoplasm of the pollen tube, especially focused in the tip region. Our results suggest that LdABP 41 belongs to the gelsolin superfamily and may play an important role in controlling actin organization in the pollen tube tip by responding to the oscillatory, tip-focused Ca 2 + gradient...|$|E
40|$|Lily (Lilium spp.) {{is among}} the most {{traditional}} and beloved ornamental flowers worldwide. The genus Lilium comprises almost one hundred species, among which is the primary subject of our research, described in this thesis, the species Lilium longiflorum (Thunb.), known as <b>trumpet</b> <b>lily</b> or Easter lily. Despite the great economic importance of ornamental lily species, little is known about its biology at the molecular level so far. In a time when two genomes are fully sequenced, Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, only a few genes have been characterized in Lilium spp. yet. Possible reasons for this are discussed throughout this thesis. This work intends to be a contribution to bridging the fundamental research concerning transcription factors involved in development of flower morphology in model species and the applied objectives of molecular breeding for manipulating flower morphology, endeavouring to create new cultivars with specific and novel features, more specifically in Lilium spp. The ABC model for floral development was proposed more than 10 years ago and since then many studies have been performed in model species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Antirrhinum majus, petunia and many other species in order to confirm this model. This investigation has led to additional information on flower development and to more complex molecular models. In the first chapter of this thesis, notions of molecular floral development, the difficulties of working with molecular biology of lily, the state-of-the-art in lily transformation are introduced, as well as general overviews of transcription factors, MADS-box genes, the ABCDE model for flower development and functional characterization of genes in heterologous systems. These concepts will guide the reader throughout the work we present here. AGAMOUS (AG) is the only C type gene found in Arabidopsis and it is responsible for stamen and carpel development as well as floral determinacy. In the second chapter, we describe the isolation of LLAG 1, a putative AG orthologue from lily (L. longiflorum) by screening a cDNA library derived from developing floral buds. The deduced amino acid sequence of LLAG 1 revealed the MIKC structure and a high homology in the MADS-box among AG and other orthologues. Phylogenetic analysis indicated close relationship between LLAG 1 and AG orthologues from monocot species. Spatial expression data showed LLAG 1 transcripts exclusively in stamens and carpels, constituting the C domain of the ABC model. Functional analysis was carried out in Arabidopsis by overexpression of LLAG 1 driven by the CaMV 35 S promoter. Transformed plants showed homeotic changes in the two outer floral whorls with some plants having the second whorl completely converted into stamens. Altogether, these data indicate a functional relationship between LLAG 1 and AG. (SEP 3) is a MADS-box homeotic gene possibly determining the E function in the ABCDE model. This function is essential for proper development of petals, stamens and carpels. In order to gain further information on lily (Lilium longiflorum) flower development at the molecular level, the cDNA library constructed from developing floral buds was screened again and our findings are reported in the chapter three. A clone (LLSEP 3) was isolated with high similarity to the SEP 3 transcription factor from Arabidopsis. LLSEP 3 belongs to the AGL 2 subfamily of MADS-box genes and shares its closest relationships with DOMADS 1 and OM 1, from the orchid species Dendrobium grex and Aranda deborah, respectively. Expression analysis by Northern hybridisation showed that LLSEP 3 was expressed throughout lily flower development and in tepals, stamens and carpel tissues of mature flowers, whereas no expression was detected in leaves. Overexpression of LLSEP 3 in Arabidopsis under the CaMV 35 S promoter induced early flowering but did not induce any floral homeotic changes, which is in accordance with the effect of SEP 3 overexpression in this species. Altogether, these data are consistent with the putative role of LLSEP 3 as an E functional gene in lily flower development. Drawbacks found during our work on functional characterisation of LLAG 1, by means of complementing the agamous mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana are described and critically discussed in chapter four. Such difficulties are, on the one hand, the nature of the AGAMOUS gene, of which the loss of function induces sterility and, on the other hand, the unavailability of the defective ag- 1 allele in another Arabidopsis background than the Landsberg erecta ecotype, which is recognisably difficult to transform by the floral dip method. Even though we did not manage to complement the AG function with LLAG 1 in a defective ag genotype so far, we could observe clear floral homeotic changes in those Arabidopsis plants ectopically overexpressing LLAG 1, which together with our data on sequence identities and expression profile described in the previous chapter of this thesis, indicated that LLAG 1 is a strong candidate to control the C function in L. longiflorum. This work also contributes towards the improvement of lily transformation procedures. In the chapter five we describe a transformation of bulblet slices by particle bombardment using a vector carrying the ArabidopsisSUPERMAN gene driven by the petunia flower-specific FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN 1 promoter and the bialaphos resistance gene phosphinothricin acetyltransferase under the CaMV 35 S promoter. Our intentions were improving the transformation parameters for lily transformation in order to reach higher efficiency, and creating novel phenotypes in lily flowers using transcription factors originating from dicot plants. We were capable of obtaining transgenic lines expressing in vitro resistance to bialaphos. The transgenic plants were transferred to the greenhouse, grown and monitored for two flowering seasons. Flowers derived from these plants appeared normal and indistinguishable from wild-type flowers and the possible reasons for this are currently under investigation. Homeotic changes in floral organs of lily (Lilium spp.) are described in chapter six. Usually, lily flowers show similar organs in their first and second whorls called tepals. They constitute the appealing and colourful features determining flower appearance. Stamens and the pistil appear as the third and fourth whorls, respectively. A double lily flower shows replacement of stamens by tepals and of its carpel by a new flower in a reiterated manner, similar to what is seen in the agamous mutant of Arabidopsis. A novel floral phenotype of lily, denominated festiva here, has never been reported in other species so far and shows a complete homeotic change of stamens into tepals, but keeps the carpel identity. We tried to explain these phenotypes taking into consideration all the evidence on the genetic mechanisms involved in flower development gathered over the last 15 years. This work launches challenges and encouragement for exploiting the molecular mechanisms involved in flower development of lily. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system has shown to be of great potential in reverse plant genetics. Advantages of VIGS over other approaches, such as T-DNA or transposon tagging, include the circumvention of plant transformation, methodological simplicity and robustness, and speedy results. These features enable VIGS as an alternative instrument in functional genomics, even in a high throughput fashion. The system is already well established in Nicotiana benthamiana, but efforts are being addressed to improve VIGS in other species, including monocots. Current research is focussed on unravelling the silencing mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) and VIGS, as well as finding novel viral vectors in order to broaden the host species spectrum. In chapter seven, we discuss the advantages of using VIGS to assess gene functions in plants. We address the molecular mechanisms involved in the process, present the available methodological elements such as vectors, inoculation procedures, and we show examples in which the system was applied successfully to characterize gene function in plants. Moreover, we analyse the potential application of VIGS in assessing genetic function of floral transcription factors from monocots. Analyses of gene functions involved in lily flower development and generation of useful information on the molecular breeding potential of this species were the main objectives of the work described in this thesis. The field for studying the molecular aspects of lily flower development is now wide open and the future may uncover very interesting aspects that will produce new tools for ornamental breeders as well as reveal particular features of monocots and the Liliaceae plant family...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the reasons for pollen sterility in lily hybrids, four diploid sterile Oriental x <b>Trumpet</b> (OT) <b>lily</b> cultivars ('Nymph', 'Gluhwein', 'Yelloween', and 'Shocking') were used to investigate the meiotic chromosome behaviors in pollen mother cells (PMCs), using genomic in situ hybridization and conventional cytological methods. At metaphase I, chromosome associations were quite variable, not only among different genotypes but also in different PMCs of the same genotype. In addition to bivalents, a certain amount of univalent, trivalents, and quadrivalents were observed in all of the investigated genotypes. In addition, ring octavalents and ring hexavalents were observed in 'Nymph'. Even dodecavalents were observed in 'Nymph'. These abnormal chromosome associations at metaphase I implied the occurrence of chromosome interchanges (translocation) in these intersectional hybrids. At anaphase-telophase, a large number of laggard chromosomes and different kinds of chromosome bridge configurations were observed. At the tetrad stage, micronuclei and polyads were also found in many PMCs. All of these abnormal chromosome behaviors in PMCs were responsible for the pollen sterility in lily hybrids...|$|R
