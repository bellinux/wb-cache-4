5|$|On {{the morning}} of 8 December, Ottoman {{artillery}} began firing on a road junction, which Mott's Detachment had to negotiate. Unable to advance or retaliate against the accurate shell fire from an Ottoman battery near Bethlehem, the detachment waited. At around noon, Chetwode, the corps' commander, ordered the detachment <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>moving.</b> Mott finally attacked his main objective at Beit Jala at 16:00, but the Ottoman Army had already retired. It {{was not until the}} evening that they continued their advanced to find the way completely clear of Ottoman defenders. At the crucial moment, Mott's Detachment was unable to cover the southern flank of the 60th (London) Division, forcing the Londoners to pause during daylight, as enfilading fire would have made any advance extremely costly.|$|E
25|$|The Right of Way card both {{remedies}} {{and protects}} against Stop and Speed Limit hazards. If a player uses this safety, he/she need {{not play a}} Roll card in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>moving</b> again; any Stop or Speed Limit cards showing in the battle/speed areas are moved to the discard pile. However, the player is still vulnerable to other hazards.|$|E

25|$|Once an Accident, Out of Gas, or Flat Tire hazard {{has been}} played, and the {{appropriate}} remedy card played to correct it, the player must next play a Roll card in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>moving</b> again. A hazard can be played onto an opponent's battle area even if another one is already showing, but only the topmost hazard needs to be corrected before that player can use a Roll card. Playing a Roll against a Stop hazard corrects it and allows the player to start moving; a second Roll is not needed.|$|E
25|$|At this point, the Broncos offense {{finally managed}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>moving,</b> {{picking up a}} first down {{for the first time}} in the game at 10:37 and moving the ball to the Seattle 35-yard line. But on third-and-13, Manning was hit by Seahawks {{defensive}} end Cliff Avril as he tried to throw a pass to Moreno, causing a high short floater that was intercepted by linebacker Malcolm Smith and returned 69 yards for a touchdown. After Seattle's kickoff, Denver mounted a drive to the Seahawks' 19-yard line, aided by Demaryius Thomas's 19-yard reception on third-and-5. With just over a minute left in the half, Denver faced fourth-and-2. Rather than kick a field goal, they tried to pick up a first down, but Manning's pass was incomplete and the score would remain 22–0 at the end of the half. The 22-point deficit was the largest faced by the Broncos all season. It was also the third-largest halftime deficit in Super Bowl history, and the previous two were also against the Broncos – the Redskins led the Broncos 35–10 in Super Bowl XXII and the 49ers led the Broncos 27–3 in Super Bowl XXIV.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 7 November 1976, three insurgents {{from a group of}} seven were spotted by an Army observation post in the Mutema Tribal Trust Lands, just south-west of Birchenough Bridge in Manicaland province. Fireforce was called up and the Rhodesians readied themselves to fly out by helicopter and engage the guerrillas. There were eight four-man [...] "stops" [...] involved in a Fireforce, and on this occasion Lamb headed Stop 2. Just before they left, Lamb ran over to Lance-Corporal Phil Kaye, the leader of Stop 3, and shouted over the noise of the aircraft. [...] "They are going to get me this time," [...] he yelled, sardonically; [...] "Just you watch, Phil Kaye!" [...] Kaye and his MAG gunner, Trooper Pat Grogan, waved away this comment and told Lamb <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>moving.</b> [...] "Go nail gooks!" [...] Kaye called after Lamb as he and the rest of Stop 2 took off aboard their Alouette III gunship. Lamb's men were an 18-year-old national service MAG gunner of Portuguese-Rhodesian extraction named Trooper Soares; Trooper Cornelius Olivier, a 20-year-old Rhodesian regular who carried an FN FAL battle rifle; and Trooper Tony Rok, an Australian Vietnam veteran, aged 28 and also equipped with an FN. Lamb carried the stick's radio on his back with his FN FAL ready in his hands.|$|E

2500|$|Moltke (the Younger) made {{substantial}} {{changes to the}} offensive concept sketched by Schlieffen in the memorandum War against France of 1905–06. The 6th and 7th armies with eight corps were to assemble along the common border, to defend against a French invasion of Alsace-Lorraine. Moltke also altered {{the course of an}} advance by the armies on the right (northern) wing, to avoid the Netherlands, retaining the country as a useful route for imports and exports and denying it to the British as a base of operations. Advancing only through Belgium, meant that the German armies would lose the railway lines around Maastricht and have to squeeze the [...] of the 1st and 2nd armies through a gap [...] wide, which made it vital that the Belgian railways were captured quickly and intact. In 1908, the General Staff devised a plan to take the Fortified Position of Liège and its railway junction by coup de main on the 11th day of mobilisation. Later changes reduced the time allowed to the 5th day, which meant that the attacking forces would need <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>moving</b> only hours after the mobilisation order had been given.|$|E
