5|$|An initial {{prototype}} design was developed between January and May 1964. When used with MAR, the MSR needed only short range, enough to hand off the Sprint missiles. <b>This</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> a design with limited radiated power. For Small City Defense, {{this would not}} offer enough power to acquire the warheads at reasonable range. <b>This</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> an upgraded design with five times the transmitter power, which was sent to Raytheon in May 1965. A further upgrade in May 1966 included the battle control computers and other features for the SCD system.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, 58 {{tourists}} and four Egyptians were massacred at nearby Deir el-Bahri by Islamist militants from Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya. <b>This</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> an overall drop in tourism in the area.|$|E

5|$|<b>This</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> {{proposals}} {{for a new}} radar dedicated solely to the early warning role, determining only which MAR or SCD would ultimately {{have to deal with}} the threat. Used primarily in the first minutes of the attack, and not responsible for the engagements, the system could be considered disposable and did not need anything like the sophistication or hardening of the MAR. <b>This</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR), which would operate cheaper electronics at VHF frequencies.|$|E

5|$|According to Kalupahana, Buddhaghosa was {{influenced}} by Mahayana-thought, which were subtly mixed with Theravada orthodoxy to introduce new ideas.

5|$|According to some scholars, the Black Stone was {{the same}} stone that Islamic {{tradition}} describes as greeting Muhammad before his prophethood. <b>This</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> a debate about whether the Black Stone's greeting comprised actual speech or merely a sound, and following that, whether the stone was a living creature or an inanimate object. Whichever was the case, the stone was held to be a symbol of prophethood.|$|E

5|$|After {{delivery}} of the barium-lanthanum material to Los Alamos, it was stored in a dedicated building in the Bayo Canyon Site. At first, the mixture was used as-is, both barium and lanthanum together, but <b>this</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> unpleasant radioactive contamination that {{took a long time}} to disappear as the half-life of barium-140 is 12.5 days. Shortly after, the process was improved; barium was removed chemically, by double precipitation from a solution as barium sulfate.|$|E
5|$|After {{the coup}} and Piłsudski's reign as dictator, he often clashed with Catholic leaders but nevertheless, enjoyed good working {{relationship}} with Cardinal Aleksander Kakowski, who subsequently led his funeral mass. In 1937, Archbishop of Kraków, Adam Stefan Sapieha, ordered to move Piłsudski's coffin from St. Leonard's Crypt to Royal Tombs at Wawel. <b>This</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> open conflict with {{the church and the}} government, which threatened to step down.|$|E
5|$|Amid rising tensions, the {{air traffic}} {{controllers}} began staging a series of work actions, including slowdowns, walkouts, and even a hunger strike. <b>This</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> chaos in Brazil's aviation industry: major delays and disruptions in domestic and international air service, stranded passengers, canceled flights, and public demonstrations. Those who blamed various civilian and military officials for the growing crisis called for their resignation.|$|E
50|$|Pratt {{invented the}} Optigraph an early {{microfilm}} reader. <b>This</b> development <b>led</b> <b>to</b> {{the formation of}} the International Filmbook company to manufacture and sell microfilm reading equipment.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{conditions}} of the Treaty of Versailles, hyperinflation spread across Germany and many lost their life savings. Halle was not spared.
