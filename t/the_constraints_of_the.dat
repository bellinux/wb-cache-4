On public display {{was an enormous}} 2 meter tall by 3 meter wide calligraphy sculpture created by Ms. Dong using naturally weathered wood from Taiwan. This is the first calligraphy sculpture in Taiwan that allows the spirit of calligraphy and the connotation of words to transcend <b>the</b> <b>constraints</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> writing brush, and its cultural and artistic significance enriched Taichung Station {{as well as the}} journeys of passengers transiting through the station.|$|E
5|$|Most Germans were {{relieved}} that the conflicts and street fighting of the Weimar era had ended. They were deluged with propaganda orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels, who promised peace and plenty for {{all in a}} united, Marxist-free country without <b>the</b> <b>constraints</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Versailles Treaty. The first major Nazi concentration camp, initially for political prisoners, was opened at Dachau in 1933. Hundreds of camps of varying size and function were created {{by the end of}} the war. Upon seizing power, the Nazis took repressive measures against their political opposition and rapidly began the comprehensive marginalisation of persons they considered socially undesirable. Under the guise of combating the Communist threat, the National Socialists secured immense power. Above all, their campaign against Jews living in Germany gained momentum.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} {{themselves were}} considered to be three-dimensional given <b>the</b> <b>constraints</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technology at the time. All the players are Caucasian and each one's batting stance is exactly the same. The game view is always top down; when batting or pitching, it is centered above the catcher, behind the batter and with an overhead look of the pitcher. In the outfield, there is an aerial view of a portion of the field, with the team members represented by tiny sprites and an inset with red dots representing where the players are on base. Although the official colors are intact, the actual symbols on their uniforms are absent. The crowd is represented by a series of colored dots, while the dugouts are represented by plain white parallelograms.|$|E

5|$|To {{overcome}} <b>the</b> <b>constraints</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bocage {{that had}} made attacks so difficult and costly for both sides, Rhino modifications were made to some M4 Sherman, M5A1 Stuart tanks and M10 tank destroyers, by fitting them with hedge-breaching 'tusks' that could force a path through hedgerows. German tanks remained restricted to the roads but U.S. armored vehicles could maneuver more freely, although {{the effectiveness of the}} devices was exaggerated. By the eve of Cobra, 60 percent of the tanks of the First Army had the rhino modification. To preserve operational security, Bradley forbade their use until Cobra was launched. In all, 1,269 M4 medium tanks, 694 M5A1 light tanks and 288 M10 tank destroyers were available.|$|E
5|$|A state {{wishing to}} devalue, {{or at least}} check the {{appreciation}} of its currency, must work within <b>the</b> <b>constraints</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prevailing International monetary system. During the 1930s, countries had relatively more direct control over their exchange rates through the actions of their central banks. Following {{the collapse of the}} Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, markets substantially increased in influence, with market forces largely setting the exchange rates for an increasing number of countries. However, a state's central bank can still intervene in the markets to effect a devaluation – if it sells its own currency to buy other currencies then this will cause the value of its own currency to fall – a practice common with states that have a managed exchange rate regime. Less directly, quantitative easing (common in 2009 and 2010), tends to lead to a fall {{in the value of the}} currency even if the central bank does not directly buy any foreign assets.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the White Paper, the Project for the Sustainable Development of Heathrow ('Project Heathrow' for short) was set up to examine how expansion at Heathrow could best be accomplished within <b>the</b> <b>constraints</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stringent environmental limits the White Paper required. A provisional assessment indicates that increased usage of the existing runways could be realised without increasing the number of people affected by noise if 'mixed mode' operations (the simultaneous use of both runways for arrivals and departures) are phased in gradually as noisier aircraft are retired. Indications ahead of the Project Heathrow environmental assessment indicate that increased noise and deterioration in air quality are likely to significantly constrain traffic using a new third runway. These issues are to be addressed as part of a three-month consultation beginning in December 2007, and considerable opposition is being mobilised against the expansion of Heathrow.|$|E

5|$|Operation Cobra was the codename for an {{offensive}} {{launched by the}} First United States Army (Lieutenant General Omar Bradley) seven weeks after the D-Day landings, during the Normandy Campaign of World War II. The intention was {{to take advantage of}} the distraction of the Germans by the British and Canadian attacks around Caen, in Operation Goodwood and break through the German defenses that were penning in his troops, while the Germans were unbalanced. Once a corridor had been created, the First Army would then be able to advance into Brittany, rolling up the German flanks once free of <b>the</b> <b>constraints</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bocage country. After a slow start the offensive gathered momentum and German resistance collapsed as scattered remnants of broken units fought to escape to the Seine. Lacking the resources to cope with the situation, the German response was ineffectual and the entire Normandy front soon collapsed. Operation Cobra, together with concurrent offensives by the British Second Army and the Canadian First Army, was decisive in securing an Allied victory in the Normandy Campaign.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also an}} {{indeterminate}} {{relationship between}} the figures in the spandrels and the lunettes beneath them. Because of <b>the</b> <b>constraints</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triangular shape, in each spandrel the figures are seated on the ground. In six of the eight spandrels the compositions resemble traditional depictions of the Flight into Egypt. Of the two remaining, one shows a woman with shears trimming the neck of a garment she is making while her toddler looks on. The Biblical woman who is recorded as making a new garment for her child is Hannah, the mother of Samuel, whose child went {{to live in the}} temple, and indeed, the male figure in the background is wearing a distinctive hat that might suggest that of a priest. The other figure who differs from the rest is a young woman who sits staring out of the picture with prophetic intensity. Her open eyes have been closed in the restoration.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — It is {{demonstrated}} clearly {{that for the}} same classic generalized system the Tsallis power-laws with both the q> 1 and the q < 1 can be induced by <b>the</b> <b>constraint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constant harmonic mean for the so-called reciprocal energies E r {{and at the same}} time the Boltzmann distribution or the negative exponential probability distribution can be generated with <b>the</b> <b>constraint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constant arithmetic mean for the generalized energies E. The author thus argues that there might be no definite “extensive system ” or “classic system ” and there are only “classic physical parameters ” and “classic constraints”. For any physical system or generalized system, it is <b>the</b> non-natural <b>constraints</b> which determine both <b>the</b> forms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entropies and the non-uniform equilibrium distributions...|$|R

25|$|The site {{originally}} chosen was Arlington Farms {{which had}} a roughly pentagonal shape, so the building was planned accordingly as an irregular pentagon. Concerned that the new building could obstruct the view of Washington, D.C., from Arlington Cemetery, President Roosevelt ended up selecting the Hoover Airport site instead. The building retained its pentagonal layout because a major redesign at that stage would have been costly, and Roosevelt liked the design. Freed of <b>the</b> <b>constraints</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> asymmetric Arlington Farms site, it was modified into a regular pentagon which resembled the star forts of the gunpowder age.|$|E

25|$|Alabama has 67 counties. Each {{county has}} its own elected {{legislative}} branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of <b>the</b> <b>constraints</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alabama Constitution, which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited home rule. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning. The cumbersome process results in local jurisdictions being unable to manage their problems, and the state legislators being buried in local county issues.|$|E
