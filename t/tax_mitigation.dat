40|$|Abstract: Integrated {{assessments}} {{of climate change}} commonly rely {{on the assumption that}} technological progress outgrows climate change damages by an order of magnitude, even without any climate policy. Then, mitigating greenhouse gases is a redistribution from the poor present to a rich future. The optimal climate policy is highly sensitive to these growth assumptions. While the world economy experienced enormous growth over the last century, it remains uncertain whether such growth can be sustained over several more centuries. We incorporate growth uncertainty into an integrated assessment model that was recently employed to determine the US federal social cost of carbon. We derive optimal carbon <b>taxes</b> and <b>mitigation</b> rates in a stochastic dynamic programming framework, solving the non-linear, out-of-steady state problem. This approach differs largely from the Monte-Carlo simulations that are current state of the art in the integrated assessment of climate change.

This paper addresses ways to reduce future losses by first focusing on behavioral biases that lead homeowners and decision-makers not to invest in adequate protection. It then turns to developing proposals for risk management strategies that involve private-public partnerships. These include multi-year insurance contracts with risk-based premiums, insurance vouchers to address affordability concerns for low-income homeowners, <b>tax</b> incentives, <b>mitigation</b> loans coupled with well-enforced building codes and land-use regulations. 2 “Our nation is facing large-scale risks at an accelerating rhythm, and we are more vulnerable to catastrophic losses due to the increasing concentration of population and activities in high-risk coastal regions of the country.

40|$|Africa {{severely}} lacks generation capacity, despite possessing {{an abundance}} of natural resources {{that could be used}} for electricity generation. Generation capacity will need to be increased to achieve economic and social development benefits. There are many initiatives to increase generation capacity in Africa, both from local governments and from international organizations such as the UN SE 4 ALL and US Power Africa initiatives. It is expected that Africa will undergo rapid electrification in the coming decades. Little research has been done with regards to how this generation capacity will develop. If it follows the example of other developing regions such as China and Brazil, it is expected that a fossil fuel intensive grid will develop. It is speculated that Africa can ‘leapfrog’ into a low-emissions grid as the late-comer effect makes renewable energy relatively more competitive than in other regions. Based on a scenario analysis with the Integrated Assessment Model TIAM-ECN, we estimate potential for leapfrogging for African sub-regions under different mitigation scenarios. From the baseline scenario it was established that electricity demand in Africa is expected to increase 5 -fold by 2050 and that gas-fired power plants will become the dominant form of generation capacity for most of the continent. From simulation results it is found that African carbon emission can be reduced by 50 % in a $ 10 /tonne carbon tax scenario to 92 % in a stringent $ 50 /tonne carbon <b>tax</b> scenario. <b>Mitigation</b> potential differs significantly between African sub-regions. Morocco and Ethiopia show particular leapfrogging potential. Carbon tax could lead South Africa to divert from its coal-intensive grid.

40|$|In this paper, we {{acknowledge}} that the mitigation of and {{adaptation to climate change}} have differential fiscal impacts. Whereas mitigation typically raises fiscal revenues, adaptation is costly to the taxpayer and to a greater extent the more distortionary the tax system is. In an OLG model with majority voting, we analyze how the choices of mitigation and adaptation are distorted under a lump-sum and a distortionary income tax regime. We find that whenever emissions and adaptation exhibit stock characteristics, the levels of mitigation and adaptation are chosen inefficiently low in the political equilibrium under lump-sum taxation. By contrast, the political equilibrium may entail inefficiently high mitigation or inefficiently high adaptation (but not both simultaneously) if the tax system is distortionary. A calibration of our model to the German economy shows that both mitigation and adaptation can be expected to be inefficiently low in the political equilibrium. Furthermore, the standard assumption of a lump-sum tax system when analyzing mitigation and adaptation is found to underestimate the loss in utilitarian welfare relative to a distortionary <b>tax</b> system, although <b>mitigation</b> levels are generally higher under the latter regime...|$|R
40|$|A dynamic computable general {{equilibrium}} (CGE) {{model is}} used to analyse {{the impact on the}} economy of taxes on CO 2 emissions combined with the Long Term Mitigation Scenarios. A sales tax is used to model the impact of a CO 2 <b>tax.</b> The <b>mitigation</b> scenarios modelled include structural shifts (for example switching from coal-fired electricity plants to nuclear power stations), changes in energy efficiency and changes in investment required. The extent of the structural shifts, changes in energy efficiency and investment required differs from scenario to scenario. The results for the mitigation scenarios indicate that the mitigation scenarios {{have a positive impact on}} GDP when investment is large. Although economic activity initially declines due to improved energy efficiency, it is followed by a period of economic expansion as lower prices increases output in most industries – this is especially the case when it is combined with higher investment. When CO 2 taxes are levied the economic impact is again positive if this is combined with either tax relief or reinvestment of the additional tax revenue. The scenarios have varied impact on labour, in general employment for semi- and unskilled labour rise if investment is higher. In most scenarios the demand for energy declines, especially for coal and petroleum. However, the demand for electricity increases if investment rises significantly. When the mitigation scenarios is combined with a CO 2 tax the results indicate that the CO 2 tax is effective in reducing output of CO 2 producing industries as it changes the relative price of the commodities produced by these industries. However, the sales tax is distortionary as it introduces price wedges in the economy while consumers may end up paying large portions of the tax. A CO 2 tax may not be the most appropriate tool to achieve the desired results considering the economic development objectives of South Africa. However, when combined with the LTMS framework its negative impact is negated by higher investment and GDP growth...|$|R

40|$|We analyse {{the effects}} of {{environmental}} taxes on welfare and carbon emissions at the household level for the case of Mexico. The integrated welfare-environmental analysis, {{which is based on}} a censored energy consumer demand system, extends previous work in two ways. First, the estimation of a full matrix of substitution elasticities allows us to test the necessity of incorporating second-order effects into the welfare analysis. Second, the substitution elasticities derived from the demand system are used to estimate the shortrun CO 2 emission-reduction potential. We find that first-order approximations of welfare effects provide reasonable estimates, particularly for carbon taxes. Analog to evidence in other low- and middle-income countries, the taxation of all energy items is found to be regressive, with the exception of motor fuels. The inclusion of CH 4 and N 2 O in a carbon tax regime comes with particularly regressive impacts because of its strong effects on food prices. The analysis of the emission implications of different tax scenarios indicates that short-run emission reductions at the household level can be substantial - though the effects depend on how revenue is recycled. This effectiveness combined with moderate and manageable adverse distributional impacts renders the carbon <b>tax</b> a preferred <b>mitigation</b> instrument. Considering the large effect of food price increases on poverty and the limited additional emission-saving potential, the inclusion of CH 4 and N 2 O in a carbon tax regime is not advisable...|$|R

40|$|Different {{countries}} of the world are affected differently by the adverse impacts of anthropogenic climate change. For a large country consisting of several regions with different geographical conditions, the direct geographical impacts of climate change may differ significantly. Given the inhomogeneous regional economic development typical for many large countries already for the present climate, this suggests that regional economic disparities may increase even further as global warming develops. It is thus important that the impacts of climate mitigation policies are assessed not only on global and national levels, but also on the regional level. The key tool for assessing the efficiency of climate mitigation policies and their impacts are Integrated Assessment models (IAMs), i. e. dynamic models of the coupled climate?socioeconomic system. The family of IAMs described in the present paper represent extensions and modifications of a set of actor-based system-dynamics models reported earlier in Hasselmann K. (2013), Detecting and responding to climate change, Tellus B 65, 20088, [URL] (open access). The models focus on the strategies of key decision-making aggregate economic actors (often pursuing conflicting goals) that jointly govern the dynamic evolution of the socio-economic system. We start from a global IAM in which both fossil-fuel-based capital and renewable-energy-based capital determine the production function. We compare a business-as-usual scenario (no mitigation policy) with various mitigation scenarios with different global carbon tax rates. The revenues from the carbon <b>tax</b> in the <b>mitigation</b> scenarios are recirculated into the economy in the form of investments in renewable-energy-based capital. We explore both the case of constant productivity of renewable-energy-based capital and the case with endogenous improvement of renewable-energy productivity through learning-by-doing effects. The model simulations demonstrate that efficient mitigation policies are feasible with readily affordable costs. From this we develop a regionalized IAM along the same methodological lines. We consider a large country composed of two regions characterized by different climates and levels of economic development. This is coupled to large residual "country" representing the "rest of the world". It is assumed that a harmonized carbon tax is imposed in both regions of the country and also {{in the rest of the}} world. We explore to which extent the transfer of money from carbon tax revenues between the two regions undertaken by a national government can moderate regional disparities in economic development and climate change impacts. The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme under Grant Agreement No. 308601 (COMPLEX) ...|$|R

40|$|Tax {{avoidance}} is {{a problem}} in every modern tax system, specifically when businesses and personal transactions are overwhelmed by the impact of high tax rates. In the case of Duke of Westminster (1936), the courts had traditionally permitted taxpayers to diminish their tax liabilities. There are two ways to escape paying taxable liability: one is tax avoidance, which is legal and the other is tax evasion, which is illegal. The form approach, instead of the substance approach, was traditionally applied by the courts in tax cases and an arrangement was allowed, whether tax avoidance was or was not the purpose of the arrangement. When an arrangement involves an "anti-avoidance" section, the courts usually disregard the condition of tax avoidance arrangement. <b>Tax</b> <b>mitigation</b> is one example of this rule. There are two "anti-avoidance" sections in the Income Tax Act 1994 : specific anti-avoidance provision and general anti-avoidance provision. Tax avoidance arrangement is affirmed in the case of McGukian and the Commissioner. Part IVA is the current anti-avoidance provision of Australia income tax legislation. It is applicable when a tax advantage is gained from the arrangement by the taxpayer. There are a few federal taxes (e. g. FBT, superannuation guarantee charge and income tax etc.) that have been falsely avoided from being paid and have been found as crimes under the Crimes Act 1980. Trying to avoid tax on a tax haven income is a crime. A general anti-avoidance provision is applicable when a taxpayer has received an advantage in association with the arrangement that was committed. It is important to examine all corners of a tax planning scheme for possible tax benefits. Tax benefits have amendments propositions and the reasonable test will be amended. The Income Tax Assessment Act 1891 was the first income tax act in New Zealand and during the 20 th century, there were other acts that followed at different times: the Land and Income Tax Act 1923, the Land and Income Tax Act 1954, the Income Tax Act 1976, and the Income Tax Act 1994. Goods and Services Tax Act was first introduced on 1 October 1986. Both sections 76 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 contain the same wordings. Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act defines tax avoidance arrangement. Section 76 (8) defines "tax avoidance". Section BG 1 is designed to counteract the tax avoidance arrangement. The definition of arrangement contains three elements: agreement, contract and plan or understanding. The definition of tax avoidance raises doubts in the case of BNZI where tax avoidance existed in downstream transactions. <b>Tax</b> <b>mitigation</b> and tax avoidance are distinguished but may not solve all problems globally. Case K 52 (1988) 10 NZTC 426 is another example of a tax avoidance arrangement.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{the author}} discusses the complexities involved in applying {{the doctrine of}} choice. The rationale behind its existence {{appears to be a}} good one – it is a judicial tool used to provide the balance between legitimate <b>tax</b> <b>mitigation</b> and illegal tax avoidance. The concept behind this doctrine is that it provides the taxpayers with some guidelines as to when a transaction will or will not be caught under the tax avoidance rules. Although theoretically choice doctrine was created to provide taxpayers some relief and certainty from the apparently harsh tax avoidance rules, the practical application of the doctrine is considerably uncertain {{because of the nature of}} its existence. The problematic aspect of this doctrine is that it is not legislated. It is a creature of statutory interpretation and its application lies in understanding the scheme and purpose of a particular provision. In this dissertation the author discusses the issues facing the application of the choice doctrine. It is important to understand when choice doctrine should be applied. Furthermore, it is essential to understand how this principle is applied in New Zealand. In recent cases, the judges have applied this doctrine and the tax avoidance rules quite differently to what is considered the ‘traditional legal approach’. The author intends to expound upon the effect and consequence of the current judicial approach towards the legal methodology used in the application of the tax avoidance rules and the choice principle...|$|E
40|$|Taxation inevitably {{gives rise}} to tax planning. In the era of globalization, multinationals in {{particular}} may not only try to exploit options, inconsistencies and gaps in domestic tax legislation, but they will also (re-) organize their business {{so as to make}} an optimal use of international tax sheltering opportunities. In order to curb ‘aggressive’ tax arbitrage, all developed jurisdictions rely on targeted anti-avoidance provisions. In addition, most tax systems will have recourse to a statutory general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) or judge-made anti-avoidance doctrine to that effect; by contrast, the UK tax system relies on extensive purposive construction to thwart tax saving schemes that are based on an overly literal or technical interpretation of the tax statues. Under either approach, the most difficult task for tax administrations and courts is to draw as bright a line as possible between legitimate <b>tax</b> <b>mitigation</b> and unacceptable tax avoidance schemes. In areas of taxation that are harmonized by EU law, the issue becomes even more complex due to the influence of the ECJ doctrine of prohibition of abuse of (tax) law. This working paper deals with the anti-avoidance clause of Art. 15 of the EU Merger Directive, which is considered to be the most refined reflection of that doctrine in direct tax law. The paper first examines the Union law concept of tax avoidance in general, and under the Merger Directive in particular. The corresponding sections critically analyze the doctrinal approach of the ECJ; they also discuss key criteria and structural features that are relevant in the context of any kind of GAAR in order to distinguish it from mere purposive construction and to establish a dividing line to acceptable tax planning. Second, the paper highlights the implications of Art. 15 Merger Directive with respect to national anti-avoidance rules or doctrines that apply to cross-border reorganizational operations. A possible direct effect and mandatory nature of these and other ‘anti-tax abuse’-provisions of EU law will be discussed, as well as questions of burden of proof and the admissibility of legal presumptions of tax avoidance. ...|$|E
