With tools our Australian deserts may be turned into gardens... They will pluck the hidden treasure from the bowels of the earth, enable us to soar in the air, or explore the depths of the water. They will weave a network of communication over our island continent, dot it with the homes of a happy people, and minister to our wants in providing not only the necessities and comforts of life, but the most refined luxuries <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> to satisfy the novel and exacting wants which arise every day, as the standard of intellectual and technical cultivation is raised and extended among us...|$|E

25|$|The anthropic {{principle}} states that fundamental {{laws of the}} universe work specifically {{in a way that}} life would be possible. The {{anthropic principle}} supports the Rare Earth Hypothesis by arguing the overall elements <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> to support life on Earth are so fine-tuned that it is nearly impossible for another just like it to exist by random chance.|$|E
25|$|In June 2015, astronomers {{reported}} evidence for Population III {{stars in the}} Cosmos Redshift 7 galaxy (at z = 6.60) found in Sextans.

25|$|A second {{important}} {{concern is}} the appropriate source of the eggs <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>needed.</b> SCNT requires human eggs, {{which can only be}} obtained from women. The most common source of these eggs today are eggs that are produced and in excess of the clinical need during IVF treatment. This is a minimally invasive procedure, but it does carry some health risks, such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.|$|E

25|$|Since 2010, EastEnders {{no longer}} uses tapes in the {{recording}} or editing process. After footage is recorded, the material is sent digitally to the post production team. The editors then assemble all the scenes recorded for the director to view and note any changes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>needed.</b> The sound team also {{have the capability to}} access the edited episode, enabling them to dub the sound and create the final version.|$|E
25|$|Notwithstanding {{the above}} advantages, railguns {{are still very}} much at the {{research}} stage and {{it remains to be}} seen whether or not railguns will ever be deployed as practical military weapons. Any trade-off analysis between electromagnetic (EM) propulsion systems and chemical propellants for weapons applications must also factor in the novelty and complexity of the pulsed power supplies <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> in electromagnetic launcher systems.|$|E
25|$|Working {{scientists}} {{usually take}} for granted a set of basic assumptions <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> to justify the scientific method: (1) {{that there is an}} objective reality shared by all rational observers; (2) that this objective reality is governed by natural laws; (3) that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation. Philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid.|$|E

This source code can be found without modification on select devices, mainly the Nexus series of devices. The source code is, in turn, adapted by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to run on their hardware. Android's source code does not contain the often proprietary device drivers <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> for certain hardware components.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of blood clots can be interrupted and prevented {{by the use}} of medication, changing risk factors and other interventions. Some risk factors can be modified. These would be losing weight, increasing exercise and the cessation of oral contraceptives. Moving during periods of travel is a modifiable behavior. Preventing blood clots includes the use of medications that interrupt the complex clotting cascade and changing the proteins <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> for clotting. Antiplatelet drugs also have an effect in preventing the formation of clots.|$|E
25|$|The {{dimension}} of an algebraic variety {{may be defined}} in various equivalent ways. The most intuitive way is probably the {{dimension of}} the tangent space at any Regular point of an algebraic variety. Another intuitive way is to define the dimension {{as the number of}} hyperplanes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> in order to have an intersection with the variety that is reduced to a finite number of points (dimension zero). This definition is {{based on the fact that}} the intersection of a variety with a hyperplane reduces the dimension by one unless if the hyperplane contains the algebraic variety.|$|E

25|$|If {{swallowing}} problems (dysphagia) occur, {{they typically}} present {{during the second}} decade of life. Dysphagia is common because of the neurological changes that interfere with coordination of mouth and pharynx (throat) movements <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> for safe and efficient swallowing. Coordination problems involving the mouth may make chewing difficult and increase the duration of meals. Problems involving the pharynx may cause liquid, food, and saliva to be inhaled into the airway (aspiration). People with dysphagia may not cough when they aspirate (silent aspiration). Swallowing problems and especially swallowing problems with silent aspiration may cause lung problems due to inability to cough and clear food and liquids from the airway.|$|E
25|$|Inquiries {{that began}} with the Geissler tube {{continued}} as even better vacuums were produced. The most famous was the evacuated tube used for scientific research by William Crookes. That tube was evacuated by the highly effective mercury vacuum pump created by Hermann Sprengel. Research conducted by Crookes and others ultimately led to the discovery of the electron in 1897 by J. J. Thomson and X-rays in 1895 by Wilhelm Roentgen. But the Crookes tube, as it came to be known, produced little light because the vacuum in it was too good and thus lacked the trace amounts of gas <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> for electrically stimulated luminescence.|$|E
25|$|Lotto designs model any lottery that is {{run in the}} {{following}} way: Individuals purchase tickets consisting of k numbers chosen from a set of n numbers. At a certain point the sale of tickets is stopped {{and a set of}} p numbers is randomly selected from the n numbers. These are the winning numbers. If any sold ticket contains t or more of the winning numbers, a prize is given to the ticket holder. Larger prizes go to tickets with more matches. The value of L(n,k,p,t) is of interest to both gamblers and researchers, as this is the smallest number of tickets <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> to be purchased in order to guarantee a prize.|$|E

25|$|The {{first step}} in {{processing}} the grapes at the winery is to separate {{the components of the}} wort <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> from the unwanted parts. The process followed at this stage will largely determine the future quality of the wine. For this, the clusters are generally shaken then trampled. The practice of moderate trampling allows the grains to burst, releasing the juice and pulp (it cannot be used for white wine from black grapes as the premature bursting of the berries would cause a coloured must). The practice of shaking or stalking has the advantage of separating the stems from the cluster of grapes and avoids giving the wine a herbaceous taste at pressing. The skin is not macerated and the transparent yellow colour is retained.|$|E
25|$|The immunosuppressants <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> {{to prevent}} organ {{rejection}} also introduce some risks. By lowering the body's ability {{to mount an}} immune reaction, these medicines also increase the chances of infection. Antibiotics may be prescribed in order to treat or prevent such infections. In turn, infection may {{increase the risk of}} rejection, and generally an interaction may prevail between both risks. Certain medications may also have nephrotoxic or other potentially harmful side-effects. Other medications may also be prescribed in order to help alleviate these side effects. There is also the risk that a patient may have an allergic reaction to the medications. Close follow-up care is required in order to balance the benefits of these drugs versus their potential risks.|$|E
25|$|Motorways exist {{around the}} largest cities; {{many of the}} larger cities have {{introduced}} toll schemes to help finance roads. In 2008, 130 ferry routes remained in service, operated by private companies on contract with the Public Roads Administration. Since the 1970s the heaviest rural investments have been mainland connections to replace the many car ferries <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> to cross fjords and connect to islands. There are not enough funding through tax money, so these tunnels and bridges are normally financed mainly through toll fees. Some mountain passes have severe snowstorm problems in the winter, so often {{they have to be}} closed, or cars have to drive after a snowplow in a column. The most exposed mountain passes are closed the entire winter.|$|E
