5|$|Lion was hit twice more, {{during what}} came to be called the 'Run to the North', after the German battlecruisers made their own turn north. Beatty's ships {{maintained}} full speed to try <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> separation between them and the High Seas Fleet and gradually moved out of range. They turned north and then northeast to try to rendezvous with {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet. At 5:40pm they opened fire again on the German battlecruisers. The setting sun blinded the German gunners, and they could not make out the British ships and turned away to the northeast at 5:47. Beatty gradually turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet into its battle formation and to move ahead of it, but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading division to fall off towards the east, further away from the Germans. By 6:35 Beatty was following the 3rd BCS as they were steering east-southeast, leading the Grand Fleet, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their southwest. A few minutes earlier Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° starboard turn, and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze. At 6:44 Beatty turned his ships southeast and to the south-southeast four minutes later searching for Hipper's ships. Beatty took this opportunity to recall the two surviving ships of the 3rd BCS to take position astern of New Zealand and then slowed down to eighteen knots and altered course to the south to prevent himself from getting separated from the Grand Fleet. At this moment Lions gyrocompass failed, and she made a complete circle before her steering was brought under control again. At 6:55 Scheer ordered another 180° turn, which put them on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet, which had altered course itself to the south. This allowed the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer's T, and they badly damaged his leading ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180° turn at 7:13 in an attempt to extricate the High Seas Fleet from the trap into which he had sent them.|$|E

25|$|Starting {{the third}} quarter on offense, David Garrard and the Jaguars tried <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> points on the board. However, all of their hopes were dashed when {{defensive}} end Cory Redding recovered a key fumble for 26 yards. Taking advantage of this, Hasselbeck again found Houshmandzadeh for his second touchdown to seal the game at 27–0. The Seahawks would later score again as Matt Hasselbeck threw his fourth touchdown again to Burleson, while defensive end Nick Reed scored from 79 yards out from a fumble recovery, putting the Seahawks up 41–0.|$|E
25|$|Humphrey's {{also ordered}} three diversionary demonstrations along the line. Two regiments of Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Gershom Mott's {{division}} marched against the Confederate line {{west of the}} Crow House redoubt while two other regiments from that division captured part of the Confederate picket line along the Boydton Plank Road line near Burgess Mill. Skirmishers from Brigadier General William Hays's division were able <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> guns out of action in Confederate Fort Powell at Burgess Mill which covered the junction of the White Oak Road and the Boydton Plank Road before Hays's men were thrown back by the defenders.|$|E

25|$|As CIGS, Ironside {{adopted a}} policy of rapidly {{building}} up a strong force in France, aiming <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> twenty divisions in the field. However, this force would be broadly defensive, acting to support the French Army, and he aimed to influence {{the course of the}} war by forming a second strong force in the Middle East, which would be able to operate in peripheral operations in the Balkans. He strongly supported the development of a close-support air force, preferably under Army command, but at the same time argued that when a German offensive began in the West, the RAF should throw its main strength into strategic bombing of the Ruhr rather than attacking the forward units.|$|E
25|$|Stiglitz wrote {{a series}} of papers and held {{a series of}} {{conferences}} explaining how such information uncertainties may have influence on everything from unemployment to lending shortages. As the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the first term of the Clinton Administration and former chief economist at the World Bank, Stiglitz was able <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> of his views into action. For example, he was an outspoken critic of quickly opening up financial markets in developing countries. These markets rely on access to good financial data and sound bankruptcy laws, but he argued that many of these countries didn't have the regulatory institutions needed to ensure that the markets would operate soundly.|$|E
25|$|Kate now {{has three}} {{suspects}} for Janet's death: Clarkville, Moon, and Luellen May (a fellow professor who found Janet passed {{out in the}} bathtub at a party). After a visit from Janet's brother and a tour of Janet's old apartment, Kate begins <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> ideas together about what really happened to Janet. Kate then visits with Clarkville once more to discuss his finding of Janet's body. In the meeting, Clarkville explains that the last time anyone had seen Janet alive was in the department meeting. During the meeting, Janet had become hysterical about an issue that {{caused a lot of}} tension in the room. Kate then gets Clarkville to admit to moving Janet's body to the men's room for her to be 'discovered'. Clarkville explains that he had originally found Janet in the chairman's office dead and decided to move her to a restroom (the men's room was the closest) and reported finding her there. Kate then is granted access to Janet's office at the university and finds a poem that she believes is the biggest clue to Janet's death.|$|E

25|$|Seahawks {{running back}} David Hughes {{returned}} the opening kickoff 34 {{yards to the}} 40-yard line, and his team drove to the Raiders 34 from there. But defensive back Lester Hayes picked off a pass from Dave Krieg and returned it 44 yards to the Seattle 26. On the Raiders ensuing drive, a 19-yard run by Allen set up a 20-yard field goal by Chris Bahr. In the second quarter, Allen broke off a 16-yard run, while Raiders quarterback Jim Plunkett completed passes to Cliff Branch and Malcolm Barnwell for gains of 11 and 20 yards on a 61-yard drive that ended with Frank Hawkins' 1-yard touchdown run. Then Seattle went three and out and LA got the ball back with good position on their 40-yard line. Plunkett's 49-yard completion to Barnwell then set up Hawkins' second rushing touchdown, making the score 17–0. With 1:02 left in the half, Seattle desperately tried <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> points on the board before halftime, but defensive back Mike Davis intercepted a pass from Krieg at his own 40-yard line. A 20-yard completion from Plunkett to Barnwell then set up Bahr's 45-yard field goal to give the Raiders a 20–0 halftime lead.|$|E
25|$|Detroit {{finally managed}} <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> {{points on the}} board {{the next time they}} got the ball, driving 46 yards in nine plays. The key play was a 17-yard run by Ron Rivers on fourth and 4 from the Lions 45. After {{reaching}} the Buccaneers 17, Mitchell suffered a concussion on a 2-yard run and was replaced by Frank Reich. On the next play after the injury, Jason Hanson kicked a 33-yard field goal, cutting the score to 20-3. Then after a Bucs punt, Reich completed all five of his pass attempts for 71 yards (3 of them to Johnnie Morton for 45) on the way to Tommy Vardell's 1-yard touchdown run, and the lead was trimmed to 20-10. The Lions seemed primed to make a serious comeback attempt when they forced Tampa Bay into a third and 5 situation on their own 10-yard line, but Dilfer's 50-yard completion to Robb Thomas moved the ball to the Lions 36. The Bucs were unable to score, but Sean Landeta's punt pinned the Lions back at their own 4-yard line with 3:20 left in the game. Then after completing a 14-yard pass on third and 15 during their final drive, Reich accidentally spiked the ball on fourth down, giving the ball to Tampa Bay.|$|E
25|$|Jones was {{employed}} {{as one of}} the Superintendents of Works for the Great Exhibition of 1851. He was responsible for not only the decoration of Joseph Paxton's gigantic cast iron and glass palace, but also for the arrangement of the exhibits within, and this was the architectural project which first brought Jones to the wider public's attention. Based on his observations of primary colour polychromy within the architecture of Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece and at the Alhambra, he chose a simple palette of red, yellow and blue for the interior ironwork. Colour theories were relatively new, and his controversial paint scheme created much debate and negative publicity in the newspapers and journals of the day. Crucially, after early viewings, Prince Albert maintained his support, and Jones ploughed on regardless. The public and professional criticism gradually dissipated until the building was eventually unveiled by Queen Victoria to much critical acclaim – some commenting that Jones's colouring was similar in effect to the paintings of Turner. Jones had been offered a rare chance <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> of his theories on polychromy into practice on a grand scale: six million people witnessed his vision at the Great Exhibition during its short existence – roughly three times the population of London at that time.|$|E

25|$|Rep. John Bingham, the {{principal}} framer of the Fourteenth Amendment, advocated that the Fourteenth applied {{the first eight}} Amendments of the Bill of Rights to the States. The U.S. Supreme Court subsequently declined to interpret it that way, despite the dissenting argument in the 1947 case of Adamson v. California by Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black that the framers' intent should control the Court's interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment (he included a lengthy appendix that quoted extensively from Bingham's congressional testimony). Although the Adamson Court declined to adopt Black's interpretation, the Court during the following twenty-five years employed a doctrine of selective incorporation that succeeded in extending to the States {{almost all of the}} protections in the Bill of Rights, as well as other, unenumerated rights. The Bill of Rights thus imposes legal limits on the powers of governments and acts as an anti-majoritarian/minoritarian safeguard by providing deeply entrenched legal protection for various civil liberties and fundamental rights. The Supreme Court for example concluded in the West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943) case that the founders intended the Bill of Rights <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>some</b> rights out of reach from majorities, ensuring that some liberties would endure beyond political majorities. As the Court noted the idea of the Bill of Rights “was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts.” This is why “fundamental rights may not be submitted to a vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.” The 14th Amendment has vastly expanded civil rights protections and is cited in more litigation than any other amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E
