5|$|A live-action TV series {{adaptation}} of the first game, titled Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner, was produced and aired in Japan. Originally only scheduled for one thirteen-episode season in 1997, popular demand prompted <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second season, which broadcast in 1998. The first series follows the plot of Devil Summoner, while the second season follows an original story. For their VHS release, the subtitle Bright Demon Advent was added.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> final {{combined}} {{image at}} each wavelength was a complex process.

5|$|The {{technical}} aspect {{of an investigation}} is divided into several sub-branches, relating {{to the type of}} digital devices involved; computer forensics, network forensics, forensic data analysis and mobile device forensics.

5|$|Abnormalities in the ARH gene, {{also known}} as LDLRAP1, were first {{reported}} in a family in 1973. In contrast to the other causes, two abnormal copies of the gene are required for FH to develop (autosomal recessive). The mutations in the protein tend to cause <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shortened protein. Its real function is unclear, {{but it seems to}} play a role in the relation between the LDL receptor and clathrin-coated pits. People with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia tend to have more severe disease than LDLR-heterozygotes but less severe than LDLR-homozygotes.|$|E

5|$|Archeological {{evidence}} for {{agriculture in the}} Sangam age has been retrieved from sites such as Mangudi, Kodumanal and Perur, which have yielded charred remains of seeds of crops like rice, millets including pearl millets, pulses and cotton. It has been deduced that agriculture most likely involved dry farming, with additional irrigation for cotton and rice; mixed cropping {{seems to have been}} undertaken to replenish the nitrogen in the soil—this also suggests a spread of labour and knowledge of different sowing and harvesting techniques. The presence of cotton seeds indicates <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crop aimed at craft production, which is also attested by finds of cotton and spindle whorls at Kodumanal. Remains of structures that resemble an artificial water reservoir have been located at different sites. In Arikamedu, a few terracotta ring-wells were found {{at the bottom of the}} reservoir; it has been suggested that the ring wells were to assure the supply of water during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|Before Donkey Kong Countrys production, Rare's Tim and Chris Stamper {{invested}} and programmed {{experiments with}} a Silicon Graphics Challenge workstation, with their initial focus centred on a boxing game. Although never reaching beyond {{the stages of}} initial development, senior Nintendo staff who visited their Twycross studio were impressed with their progress after being shown a working demo. Genyo Takeda was dispatched to Japan to advise then-president of Nintendo Hiroshi Yamauchi on securing a deal with Rare. Following talks between Yamauchi and Rare staff, Nintendo acquired 49% of the company, which culminated in <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new title using Alias and SGI technology {{and the addition of}} Rare as a second-party developer. The Stampers expressed interest in making a game based on Donkey Kong and were given Nintendo's permission.|$|E
5|$|Carte {{also built}} the Savoy Hotel in London, and {{acquired}} other luxury hotels. In addition, he erected the Palace Theatre, London, {{which he had}} intended to be {{the home of a}} new school of English grand opera, although this ambition was not realised beyond <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single grand opera by Sullivan, Ivanhoe. Nevertheless, his partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan, and his careful management of their operas and relationship, created a series of works whose success was unprecedented in the history of musical theatre. His opera company, later operated by Helen and then by his son, Rupert, and granddaughter, Bridget, promoted those works for over a century, and they are still performed regularly today.|$|E

5|$|During {{his tenure}} on Why Don't You?, Davies oversaw <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> story {{that took place}} in Loch Ness. The story was the {{precursor}} for his first freelance children's project: Dark Season. The show, originally called The Adventuresome Three, would feature the Why Don't You? characters in a purely dramatic setting that was influenced by his childhood. He submitted the script {{to the head of the}} BBC's Children's department, Anna Home, and Granada Television. Both companies were interested in producing the show with minor changes: Granada wished to produce it as one six-part serial, as opposed to Davies' plan of two three-part serials; and Home was interested in accepting the show on the condition it included a new cast of characters. He accepted Home's offer, and the show was allocated the budget and timeslot of Maid Marian and her Merry Men, which had been put on hiatus the year before.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium {{was first}} {{identified}} in December 1952 by Albert Ghiorso and co-workers at the University of California, Berkeley {{in collaboration with}} the Argonne and Los Alamos National Laboratories, in the fallout from the Ivy Mike nuclear test. The test was carried out on November 1, 1952 at Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific Ocean and was the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb. Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new isotope of plutonium, , which could only have formed by the absorption of six neutrons by a uranium-238 nucleus followed by two beta decays.|$|E
5|$|HD is one {{of several}} trinucleotide repeat {{disorders}} which are caused by the length of a repeated section of a gene exceeding a normal range. The HTT gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 4 at 4p16.3. HTT contains a sequence of three DNA bases—cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG)—repeated multiple times (i.e.... CAGCAGCAG...), known as a trinucleotide repeat. CAG is the 3-letter genetic code (codon) for the amino acid glutamine, so a series of them results in <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chain of glutamine known as a polyglutamine tract (or polyQ tract), and the repeated part of the gene, the PolyQ region.|$|E

5|$|If two {{cells of}} the same type meet in this phase, they cross-fertilise to a diploid zygote through the fusion of protoplasms and nuclei. The {{conditions}} which trigger this are not known. The diploid zygote becomes a multinucleated plasmodium through multiple nuclear divisions without further cell division. If the resulting cells were peritrichous, they change their shape before the fusion from the peritrichous form to the myxamoeba. For <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> zygote, cells of different mating types (heterothallic) are required.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Gerry Anderson {{supervised}} <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> short computer-animated test film, Captain Scarlet and the Return of the Mysterons, {{to explore}} the possibility of updating {{a number of his}} 1960s Supermarionation series for a 21st-century audience. The working title was Captain Scarlet – The New Millennium. Produced in London by the Moving Picture Company, the film features Francis Matthews and Ed Bishop reprising the roles of Captains Scarlet and Blue. Made using a combination of Maya 3D computer graphics software and motion-capture technology, the plot commences a few years after the Mysterons end their hostilities against Earth, but the reappearance of Captain Black sets the stage for a revival of the war with Mars. Although the film has yet to receive a home video release, it was publicly screened at a Fanderson convention in 2000 and at a science lecture in 2001.|$|E

Titled Rewrite Harvest festa!, the fan disc was produced by the same staff as Rewrite, and was released on July 27, 2012, playable on a Windows PC.
