25|$|Every spring, Fairport {{students}} celebrate Brotherhood/Sisterhood Week. The week {{is focused}} around Civility, Awareness, Respect, and Embrace (CARE). The event is most prominent at FHS, where a different activity takes place {{each day of}} the week. Monday is Family Talk Day, during which a student and an adult are selected to speak to the students. Tuesday consists of a presentation during which student voices writings are read. The writings anonymously tell students' feelings about CARE. On Wednesday, a community member is asked to speak. On Wednesday of the 2007 celebration, Rachel's Challenge visited the school. The program encouraged students to improve the atmosphere of their school. The program impacted the students in a large way, partly because they had lost a beloved member of the student body the night before. Wednesday is also the annual Junior-4th Grade walk. The district's 4th and 11th graders walk the village streets together to build relationships with each other. Thursday's program is known as Unplugged, and is a non-stop musical performance available <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> free periods or lunch.
