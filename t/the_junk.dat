5|$|Series 7 {{began on}} 25 September 1999 {{and saw the}} {{introduction}} of new presenters Steve Wilson and Emma Ledden. New features were added however unlike previous series, many of them failed to last and were continuously replaced. Short lived features included Chick or Chic, Fishing For Compliments and Great Mates. The computer game for this series was called Klunk <b>The</b> <b>Junk</b> which involved viewers guiding 'Malcolm the Alien' around space picking up space debris whilst avoiding the asteroids which would cause the player to lose a point however this too fizzled out within a few weeks. Mr Blobby's game became Blobby's Bistro however this was renamed after six weeks to Blobby's Hobbies whilst The Hot Seat became known as Live & Chatting.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{important}} {{locations are}} {{located within the}} world: these include Terminals that give access to a fast travel system; <b>the</b> <b>Junk</b> Shop, which acts as a vendor for buying and selling items; Rag's Jewelry, where gems collected during gameplay can be traded for rare items and unique demons; and the Fountain of Life, where the Protagonist and other party members can receive treatment for ailments, heal them of damage, or revive characters knocked out in battle. An optional location separate from the Vortex World is the Amala Labyrinth, accessed after the Protagonist has reached {{a certain point in}} the story. The Labyrinth is a dungeon divided into multiple floors or Kalpa, each housing both demon enemies and brokers which sell demons to the Protagonist. Each Kalpa is connected by a Warp Zone, in which the Protagonist can collect currency and items while avoiding or destroying obstacles. Proceeding through the levels of the Labyrinth requires the protagonist to find and fight Fiends carrying Candelabra, which unlock barriers. The Candelabra also act as a means of locating and either engaging or avoiding Fiends.|$|E
5|$|The Girls He Left Behind Him and The Iron Clad Lover are two 1910 American silent short comedies {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Both films were originally released together on a single reel and are two distinct and separate subjects. The Girls He Left Behind Him focuses on a young man, Jack Redfern, who receives a letter from an old sweetheart of his. This prompts him to reminiscence about all the girls he has had affections for {{on the eve of}} his wedding. All the old sweethearts of his life then appear at his wedding to wish him well. The Iron Clad Lover concerns two suitors who are vying for the affections of Bessie. Tom, who plays a game of chess with her father, ends up quarreling with him and he is thrown out of the house. The next day, Tom attempts to bring flowers and candy for Bessie's birthday, but is dismissed by the angry father. Tom decides to dress up in a suit of armor and ends up breaking a vase when trying to announce himself. The suit of armor is thrown out and Bessie and the other suitor chase down <b>the</b> <b>junk</b> dealer to free Tom from the suit of armor. Both films were released on December 9, 1910 and were met with positive reviews by The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror. Both films are presumed lost.|$|E

Running low on ammunition, the British sailed away, with the pinnace having gone for help. <b>The</b> <b>junks</b> pursued <b>the</b> retreating vessels; the Pearl was {{half the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>junks</b> and <b>the</b> Louisa a quarter of the size.

5|$|The southward {{expansion}} of the Han dynasty led to new trade routes and diplomatic contact with foreign kingdoms. In 111 BCE, Emperor Wu conquered the Kingdom of Nanyue {{in what is now}} modern northern Vietnam and Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan; thereafter he opened up maritime trade to both Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, as foreign merchants brought lapis lazuli, pearls, jade, and glasswares to the Han Empire from this southern sea route. When a group of travelers from the Roman Empire (allegedly diplomats of Marcus Aurelius but most likely Roman merchants) came to the Han court in 166 CE, they allegedly came from this southern trade route. By at least the 1st century CE— as proven by Eastern Han ceramic miniature models of ships found in various tombs— the Chinese {{would have been able to}} brave distant waters with the new steering invention of the stern-mounted rudder. This came to replace the less efficient steering oar. While ancient China was home to various ship designs, including the layered and fortified tower ship meant for calm waters of lakes and river, <b>the</b> <b>junk</b> design (jun 船) created by the 1st century CE was China's first seaworthy sailing ship. The typical junk has a square-ended bow and stern, a flat-bottomed hull or carvel-shaped hull with no keel or sternpost, and solid transverse bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in Western seacrafts. Since the Chinese junk lacked a sternpost, the rudder was attached to the back of the ship by use of either socket-and-jaw or block and tackle (which differed from the later European pintle and gudgeon design of the 12th century). As written by a 3rd-century author, junks had for-and-aft rigs and lug sails.|$|E
25|$|The keel {{was laid}} on April 24, 2003, and <b>the</b> <b>junk</b> was {{launched}} on October 25, 2003. At the launch ceremony, {{it was announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>junk</b> would be named Grace Quan, in honor of Frank Quan's mother.|$|E
25|$|While {{on patrol}} in the Gulf of Thailand near the Cambodian border {{on the night}} of 19 September 1965 Point Marone intercepted a {{suspicious}} junk operating near Ha Tien and warned it to stop for boarding. After receiving fire from <b>the</b> <b>junk</b> she returned fire, and with assistance from Point Glover they sank <b>the</b> <b>junk</b> in fifteen feet of water. After <b>the</b> <b>junk</b> was recovered the following day, rifles, grenades, ammunition and documents were discovered. The only survivor of the crew of <b>the</b> <b>junk</b> provided intelligence which led to a raid on Hon Mot that was conducted on 26 September. Point Marone participated in the raid along with cutters Point Comfort and Point Grey by transporting civilian irregular defense group (CIDG) mercenaries and their Special Forces advisors to the raid and providing fire support with the 81mm mortar.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>junks</b> approached, {{those on}} board firing their guns, yelling and shouting, while the drums and gongs were furiously beaten.|$|R
60|$|To {{make matters}} serious, during all the {{excitement}} of boarding <b>the</b> <b>junks</b> <b>the</b> Reindeer had not been bailed, and the water was beginning to slush over the cockpit floor. The shrimp-catchers pointed at it and looked to me questioningly.|$|R
50|$|As a result, the PLA {{was able}} to advance on the island, {{and despite the fact}} that all of <b>the</b> armed <b>junks</b> and <b>the</b> rest of the escort fleet were badly damaged, none of <b>the</b> <b>junks</b> had {{actually}} been sunk. In contrast, the numerically superior mountain guns had inflicted considerable damage to the nationalist fleet.|$|R

5000|$|After {{the loss}} of Shuangyu, the smugglers {{scattered}} {{along the coast of}} Zhejiang and Fujian to find good hideouts to trade. The deep water inlet of Zoumaxi (走馬溪, [...] "Running Horse Creek") by the Dongshan Peninsula near the Fujian-Guangdong border was found to be a suitable place for trade since the terrain sheltered the ships from the winds. On 19 March 1549, Lu Tang and Ke Qiao ambushed two junks in Zoumaxi while the smugglers were trading with the Portuguese aboard. Lu and Ke lured the Portuguese guards away from <b>the</b> <b>junks</b> by feigning to attack from the shore, then set upon <b>the</b> <b>junks</b> <b>the</b> Ming fleet previously hidden behind a promontory. <b>The</b> <b>junks</b> were captured after a brief and feeble resistance, resulting in 33 deaths and 206 smugglers captured. Among the captured were Li Guangtou and a number of Portuguese men, and Lu Tang had four of the more good-looking Portuguese pretend to be kings of Malacca {{in order to make the}} victory seem more complete. Fearing that the captives might bribe their way out, Zhu Wan executed 96 of the Chinese smugglers using his discretionary powers. The Portuguese record of this incident by the crewman Galeote Pereira allege that Lu Tang, Ke Qiao, and possibly Zhu Wan exaggerated their victory in hopes of being rewarded with the goods they found on <b>the</b> <b>junks,</b> and killed <b>the</b> Chinese crew to prevent the ruse of the [...] "Malaccan" [...] kings from being exposed.|$|R

25|$|In 1999, Hunt {{sought a}} job of writer-in-residence at Dublin’s Mountjoy Prison and later {{collected}} selected writings from the prisoners and edited <b>The</b> <b>Junk</b> Yard: Voices From An Irish Prison. The book contains 15 stories divided into five sections: Childhood, Family Life, The Score, Criminal Life and Prison Life. One publisher {{was critical of}} the repetitive themes of urban poverty, addiction, and life in prison, but Hunt responded by asserting that it is worth considering why the inmates had such similar tales to tell. <b>The</b> <b>Junk</b> Yard: Voices From An Irish Prison became a number-one bestseller in Ireland in 1999.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 9 March 1966 Point White was patrolling the Soài Rạp River in the Rung Sat Special Zone and {{surprised}} a Viet Cong junk crossing the river. Upon receiving machine gun fire from <b>the</b> <b>junk,</b> Point White returned fire and rammed <b>the</b> <b>junk,</b> causing it to explode and partially sinking it. After rescuing four of the Viet Cong crew from drowning, {{it was determined that}} one of the survivors was the commanding officer of the local training camp. After recovering from extensive burns the man later provided valuable intelligence about Viet Cong operations in the Rung Sat.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, <b>the</b> <b>junk</b> took {{a voyage}} around San Francisco Bay, visiting {{the sites of}} several {{historic}} Chinese immigrant shrimp fishing villages, including stops in Richmond, California, Hunters Point in San Francisco and Redwood City, California in the south bay.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Junks</b> then triced {{up their}} Boarding nettings, and came into action {{with us at}} half pistol shot; our guns were well served with grape and round shot; the first shot we gave them they opened a {{tremendous}} and well directed fire upon us, from all their Guns (each Junk had 10 Guns, and they brought all these over on the side which we engaged them on) ... <b>The</b> <b>Junk's</b> fire, Thank God! was not enough depressed, or ... none would have lived to tell the Story.—19 of their Guns we received in the mainsail,—the first Broadside I can assure you was not pleasant.|$|R
50|$|Two {{other young}} men from Dartmouth, John Potter and Gordon Torrey, had {{yachting}} experience; both of them left the crew after <b>the</b> <b>junk's</b> unsuccessful first voyage and later offered accounts of their experience.|$|R
5|$|Before the battle, Captain Charles Elliot, {{the chief}} {{superintendent}} of British trade in China, sailed to Kowloon in the cutter Louisa for food supplies, {{accompanied by the}} schooner Pearl and a pinnace from HMS Volage. Upon encountering three Chinese junks, Elliot sent interpreter Karl Gutzlaff with demands to re-allow the supply of provisions. After several hours of unsuccessful correspondence, Elliot delivered an ultimatum that if provisions were not received, <b>the</b> <b>junks</b> would be sunk. When it expired with no results, the British opened fire on <b>the</b> <b>junks,</b> which returned fire {{with support from the}} fort on shore. During the engagement, <b>the</b> larger <b>junks</b> pursued <b>the</b> British boats which were sailing away after running low on ammunition. But after replenishing their cartridges, the British re-engaged the ships, which retreated to their former position, ending the clash in a stalemate.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>junk</b> {{is built}} of lumber native to California. The keel, planks, frames and deck {{are made of}} redwood. The mast, stem, thwarts and oars are made of Douglas fir. The mast was made from an 80 foot tall Douglas fir tree from Napa County.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>junk</b> is docked at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park at Hyde Street Pier in {{the winter}} and at China Camp State Park in San Rafael in the summer. It sails between these {{locations}} twice a year, a distance of about 15 nautical miles.|$|E
25|$|The {{first act}} of war was the attack on a Chinese junk {{belonging}} to the king of Siam, which was passing by. The captain of <b>the</b> <b>junk</b> had refused to give supplies to French, especially the salt which was needed to salt meat, and therefore was fired on repeatedly.|$|E
60|$|The {{tars were}} now at work firing the gingals {{attached}} to the bulwarks and the matchlocks with which the deck was strewn, at <b>the</b> approaching <b>junks.</b> As they took steady aim, leaning their pieces on the bulwarks, they did considerable execution among the Chinamen crowded on board <b>the</b> <b>junks,</b> while <b>the</b> shot of the Chinese, for the most part, whistled far overhead; but the guns of the shore battery, which had now slewed round to bear upon them, opened with a better aim, and several shots came crashing into the sides of <b>the</b> two captured <b>junks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fernandes {{became one}} of the first Europeans to take an {{interest}} in Chinese shipbuilding, as he traveled in a Chinese junk on his return journey to Malacca and, being a former tailor, was fascinated by <b>the</b> <b>junk's</b> sails.|$|R
60|$|The {{killed and}} wounded {{were placed in}} the other gig with four sailors in charge. They were {{directed}} to keep under shelter of <b>the</b> <b>junks</b> until rejoined by the pinnace and Fothergill's gig, after these had done their work on shore.|$|R

25|$|In {{an effort}} to impose order on the {{issuance}} of tokens (and purge <b>the</b> <b>junk),</b> three banks in Montreal, plus the Quebec bank issued {{a new series of}} tokens. Said tokens included the image of a habitant {{on one side and the}} coat of arms of Montreal, along with the bank name, on the other. These tokens were popularly known as Papineaus.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, {{there was}} another major drop for the Dow on October 13, 1989—the Mini-Crash of 1989. The crash was {{apparently}} caused by a reaction to a news story of a $6.75billion leveraged buyout deal for UAL Corporation, {{the parent company of}} United Airlines, which broke down. When the UAL deal fell through, it helped trigger the collapse of <b>the</b> <b>junk</b> bond market causing the Dow to fall 190.58 points, or 6.91 percent.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, British {{reinforcements}} were arriving, {{including the}} barge from the East Indiaman Cambridge commanded by Captain Joseph Abraham Douglas and manned by 18 seamen. During <b>the</b> re-engagement, <b>the</b> <b>junks</b> retreated to their former positions. The battle {{ended in a}} stalemate. The Volage later arrived and weighed with the armed boats of the fleet, but night came {{and put an end}} to the engagement. The next morning, <b>the</b> <b>junks</b> were evacuated and with the mandarins offering [...] "no molestation", Elliot did not carry the conflict further. In total, three British were wounded; a flesh wound in the arm of Douglas, and two of his crew more severely. Lin reported two Chinese killed and six wounded.|$|R
60|$|The whole fleet was {{now under}} way. In {{addition}} to the sails they had gotten out long sweeps, and the bay was being ploughed in every direction by <b>the</b> fleeing <b>junks.</b> I was now alone in the Reindeer, seeking feverishly to capture a third prize. <b>The</b> first <b>junk</b> I took after was a clean miss, for it trimmed its sheets and shot away surprisingly into the wind. By fully half a point it outpointed the Reindeer, and I began to feel respect for the clumsy craft. Realizing the hopelessness of the pursuit, I filled away, threw out the main-sheet, and drove down before the wind upon <b>the</b> <b>junks</b> to leeward, where I had them at a disadvantage.|$|R
60|$|Percy {{was delighted}} at finding that, in the {{excitement}} caused by his news, the first lieutenant had forgotten to take any notice of his being there without orders, and he returned a defiant nod to the threat conveyed by Fothergill shaking his fist at him. As they neared <b>the</b> <b>junks</b> <b>the</b> fire of those on board redoubled, and was aided by that of many villagers gathered {{on the bank of}} the creek. Suddenly from a bank of rushes four cannons were fired. A ball struck the pinnace, smashing in her side. The other boats gathered hastily round and took her crew on board, and then dashed at <b>the</b> <b>junks,</b> which were but a hundred yards distant. The valor of the Chinese evaporated as they saw the boats approaching, and scores of them leaped overboard and swam for shore.|$|R
