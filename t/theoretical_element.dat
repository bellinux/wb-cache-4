However, Green Care is not yet widely considered to be part of mainstream psychiatry.

The victims of racism begin {{to believe the}} ideology that they are inferior and white people and white culture are superior.

Instead, it is how authority and power {{in all aspects of}} society contributes to feelings of inequality.|$|E
50|$|Cheryl I. Harris and Gloria Ladson-Billings add the <b>theoretical</b> <b>element</b> of {{whiteness}} as property. They describe whiteness {{as the ultimate}} property which whites alone can possess. It is valuable and is property. The 'property functions {{of whiteness}}'—rights to disposition, rights to use and enjoyment, reputation and status property, and the absolute right to exclude—make the American dream a more likely and attainable reality for whites as citizens. For a CRT critic, the white skin color that some Americans possess is like owning a piece of property. It grants privileges to the owner that a renter (or a person of color) would not be afforded.|$|E

Using an empirical exam-ple from a health care study, they illustrate the use of content analysis protocols to elaborate some <b>theoretical</b> <b>elements</b> of the attention-based view of the firm.

Fourier analysis and convolution theory have central role in such development. In this paper we collect <b>theoretical</b> <b>elements</b> to follow this avenue but using the q-Gaussian kernel that is a nonextensive generalization of the Gaussian one. Firstly, we review some <b>theoretical</b> <b>elements</b> behind the one-dimensional q-Gaussian and its Fourier transform. Then, we consider the two-dimensional q-Gaussian and we highlight the issues behind its analytical Fourier transform computation. We analyze the q-Gaussian kernel in the space and Fourier domains using the concepts of space window, cut-off frequency, and the Heisenberg inequality. Comment: 31 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

Implications {{for the practice of}} career counselling are discussed along with a working example of a career assessment procedure informed by the STF and Theory of Dialogical Self. It is concluded that whilst the integration of the two theoretical bodies was successful according to epistemological criteria, there remains scope for integration with theories based upon varying epistemological and ontological assumptions...|$|E

It seems that there is no space in Mexico that has not been touched by the influence and violence of ‘Narcotrafico’, Drug-trafficking. Therefore the question arose: How comes Sub-culture of ‘Narco’ idealizing deviant behaviour and which cultural aspects is in play?

This <b>theoretical</b> <b>element</b> of the study {{shows how the}} angular uncertainty is affected by internal parameters, the actual values of which are estimated. Experiments are then carried out to determine the actual uncertainty in the azimuth angle. Results are presented that show that uncertainty decreases with sampling duration. Other significant findings are that uncer-tainty is relatively constant throughout the working volume and that the uncertainty value is not dependent {{on the size of}} the reference angle...|$|E

40|$|Many {{disciplines}} aim at {{the implementation}} of measures aimed at the reduction of social risks and unsafety. Ideally, this implementation is carried out according to structured method. Such a structured, or ideal, method consists of 1) a formal description of <b>theoretical</b> <b>elements</b> of the measure, 2) the translation of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>elements</b> into practical objectives and guidelines, and 3) the empiric evaluation {{of the effects of}} the meaure in terms of underlying processes and extent of the results. This article discusses the implementation and evaluation of a traffic safety measure as an example that approaches the implementation according to the ideal method. In this example a structured implementation of intensified police enforcement to reduce speeding, proved to be successful in obtaining increased compliance with the speed limits and improved road safety on rural roads.
