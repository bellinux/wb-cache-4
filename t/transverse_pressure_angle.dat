5000|$|Just {{as there}} are three types of profile angle, there are three types of {{corresponding}} pressure angle: the <b>transverse</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>angle,</b> the normal pressure angle, and the axial pressure angle.|$|E
50|$|In {{spur gears}} and {{straight}} bevel gears, tooth profiles are considered {{only in a}} transverse plane, and the general terms profile angle and pressure angle are customarily used rather than transverse profile angle and <b>transverse</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>angle.</b> In helical teeth, the profiles may be considered in different planes, and in specifications {{it is essential to}} use terms that indicate the direction of the plane in which the profile angle or the pressure angle lies, such as transverse profile angle, normal pressure angle, axial profile angle.|$|E

30|$|It {{is obvious}} from Table  7 {{that only the}} pinions having 15 ° <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> with 0.002 mm tip relief and 20 ° <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> with 0.002 mm tip relief are {{experiencing}} lesser bending stress than Lewis maximum bending stress. Among the two models, low <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> helical pinion (15 ° <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> with 0.002 mm tip relief) running at slow speed(509.2 rpm) provide improved performance with lesser bending stress (145.588 N/mm 2) over more traditional 20 ° <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> pinion (236.606 N/mm 2). This was verified through ANSYS analysis.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>angle</b> in {{relation}} to gear teeth, {{also known as the}} angle of obliquity, is the angle between the tooth face and the gear wheel tangent. It is more precisely the angle at a pitch point between the line of pressure (which is normal to the tooth surface) and the plane tangent to the pitch surface. The <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> gives the direction normal to the tooth profile. The <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> is equal to the profile angle at the standard pitch circle and can be termed the [...] "standard" [...] <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> at that point. Standard values are 14.5, 20 and 25 degrees. Earlier gears with <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> 14.5 were commonly used because the cosine is larger for a smaller angle, providing more power transmission and less pressure on the bearing; however, teeth with smaller <b>pressure</b> <b>angles</b> are weaker. To run gears together properly their <b>pressure</b> <b>angles</b> must be matched.|$|R

30|$|This result {{indicates}} that a large load surface <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> is good for low-strength materials and a small <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> is good for high-strength materials. For materials with moderate strength, an optimal <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> is assumed to exist that realizes both load capacity with respect to bending and load capacity with respect to contact pressure.|$|R
30|$|An ISO {{standard}} {{tooth profile}} has a symmetric <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> of 20 °.

Accordingly, we analyzed the torque transmission capacity of asymmetric gears with various <b>pressure</b> <b>angles.</b>|$|R
30|$|Bending stress {{analysis}} was also performed by FEM analysis. The root stress in higher <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> teeth against unit load decreased {{because of the}} thick root of the tooth. However, the highest torque capacity for bending was expected for the tooth profile with a 30 ° <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> because an increase of the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> leads to a smaller base circle.|$|R

This paper compares degree 5, 7 y 9 Bézier curves with traditional curves in order to rationalize cam profile.

5000|$|The <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> is {{also the}} angle of the sides of the {{trapezoidal}} teeth on the corresponding rack.The force transmitted during the mating of gear teeth acts along the normal. This force has components along the pitch line and the other along the line perpendicular to the pitch line. The force along the pitch line which is responsible for power transmission is proportional to the cosine of <b>pressure</b> <b>angle.</b> The one which exerts thrust(perpendicular to the pitch line) is proportional to the sine of <b>pressure</b> <b>angle.</b> So it is advised to keep the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> low.

However, as the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> increases past 20 °, the bending strength {{can be expected}} to increase because of the increase in the tooth root thickness, and the contact pressure strength {{can be expected to}} increase because of the larger profile radius of curvature. Furthermore, although a <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> sufficiently greater than the limit of the tooth tip cannot be achieved, this can be solved by making the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> {{on each side of the}} tooth asymmetric. Unidirectional torque transfer is the principal factor in general gearing, so there may be some issues with the strength on the low-pressure side being weaker.|$|R

40|$|Three-dimensional {{design is}} central to all modern {{compressor}} design systems, {{but many of these}} methods still rely on a two-dimensional and sectional view of aerodynamics at their core. This paper argues that this view fundamentally limits design by not considering the effect, on separation and loss, of the pressure gradient {{on the surface of the}} blade perpendicular to the meridional direction, here known as the <b>transverse</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient. The first part of the paper details how altering the <b>transverse</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient, by changing a blade's 3 D stacking, switches the way in which the blade aerodynamically "fails," from a open corner separation to a trailing edge separation. It also shows how the <b>transverse</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient significantly changes the blade profile loss. In the second part, the effect of the <b>transverse</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient on the uncertainty inherent in the compressor design space is investigated. It is shown that as blade pitch-chord ratio is raised and the amount of 3 D stacking is lowered, the uncertainty of predicting a compressor's operating range is significantly raised. By increasing 3 D stacking and the strength of the <b>transverse</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient, it is shown that this uncertainty can be significantly reduced.

40|$|Spur Gear {{vibration}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} indispensable parameter in Maintenance division of an operating plant. Many methods have been adopted to control the vibration in gears. An approach of understanding the influence of <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> in spur gear vibration is required in the modern trends. <b>Pressure</b> <b>angle</b> influence in root stress has been analyzed earlier by some of the researchers, but may not be in vibration. Three steel spur gears having the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> of 140, 200 and 250 with the same face width, pitch circle diameter and number of teeth are selected for this analysis. The gears are loaded with a torque of 6. 25, 12. 5, 18. 75, 25, 38 and 50 Nm respectively. Loads are given as a transmitted and radial force on the gear tooth. A frequency response analysis has been done on the above gear using FEA Software. The result shows that gear having 200 <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> is more effective in controlling the vibration than the other two <b>pressure</b> <b>angles.</b> Also gear having 250 is also being effective in controlling the vibration than the gear having 140.

40|$|Advanced in {{engineering}} technology {{have resulted in}} increased gearing performances. The use of high power density transmission systems such as epicyclic gear trains {{is the way to}} achieve the goal reducing the overall volume and mass compared with traditional configurations. Gears are the main component of the transmissions because they play the crucial role of transmitting the power from the input to the output with a defined ratio. In terms of gear performances, tooth geometry has a direct influence on load carrying capacity: increase the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> modifies the tooth profile with a direct influence on bending and contact stress. To test the benefits of high <b>pressure</b> <b>angles</b> gears in epicyclic transmissions, four different epicyclic systems with same boundary design conditions have been modelled. The reference <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> have been varied from 20 ° to 35 ° and other gear parameters such as profile shift coefficient, addendum and dedendum length have been modified consequently to match the design requirements. The results show that increasing the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> has a reductive effect on contact and bending stresses. Using high <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> gears in epicyclic transmissions has a beneficial effect on tensile stresses but is unfavourable for the compressive ones. Moreover, it has been seen that <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> effect might be enhanced or nullified if other modifications such as profile shift are used concurrently...|$|R

30|$|A high <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> {{means that}} higher ratio of teeth {{are not in}} contact.

30|$|The {{durability}} against {{surface damage}} was evaluated {{in relation to}} Hertzian contact stress. In {{the case of a}} higher <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> tooth, the contact stress decreases with increasing relative radius of curvature. Furthermore, the Hertzian stress is proportional to the square root of the normal load. Therefore, the tooth with a <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> of 45 ° has the maximum torque capacity for surface damage.|$|R
30|$|Reduced {{bending stress}} {{because of an}} {{increase}} in tooth thickness and decreased transmission torque because of a reduction in the base circle radius work together to maximize the load capacity for bending at a <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> of around 30 °.

50|$|Standard {{practice}} {{is to make}} allowance for half the backlash in the tooth thickness of each gear.

This maintains as much strength as possible in the pinion's teeth. The amount of additional material removed when making the gears depends on the <b>pressure</b> <b>angle</b> of the teeth.
