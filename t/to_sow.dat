5|$|The chronicle {{states that}} Óláfr then married Christina, {{daughter}} of Ferchar mac an t-sagairt (d. c. 1251). Óláfr's father-in-law emerges from historical obscurity in 1215 and, {{by the mid}} 1220s (about the time of, or not long after, the marriage), Ferchar had obtained the Earldom of Ross from Alexander II, King of Scots (d. 1249) {{for his part in}} defeating the Meic Uilleim northern rebellion in 1215. The chronicle declares that Óláfr's separation from Lauon had enraged her sister, and Rögnvaldr's bitter queen sought <b>to</b> <b>sow</b> discord between the half-brothers. If the chronicle is to be believed, the queen secretly wrote under her husband's name to their son Guðrøðr, ordering him to seize and kill Óláfr. The chronicle states that Guðrøðr dutifully gathered a force on Skye and proceeded to Lewis, where he laid waste to most of the island before returning to Skye—Óláfr had narrowly escaped with a few men and fled to the protection of his father-in-law, on the mainland in Ross.|$|E
5|$|Then the Roman army {{began its}} march north, {{following}} the coastal road. 300 horse under John the Armenian were detached as an advance guard some 3 miles (4.5km) {{in front of}} the main army, while the 600 Huns covered the army's left flank. Belisarius himself with his bucellarii led up the rear, to guard against any attack from Gelimer, who was known to be in the vicinity. The fleet followed the army, sailing along the coast. The first town they encountered was Syllectum, which was captured by a detachment under Boriades by a ruse. In an attempt <b>to</b> <b>sow</b> division among the Vandals, Belisarius gave a letter written by Justinian and addressed to the Vandal nobles to a captured Vandal messenger, in which the emperor claimed to be campaigning on behalf of the legitimate king Hilderic against the usurper Gelimer.

40|$|An on-farm {{experiment}} was conducted utilizing 140 <b>sows</b> <b>to</b> compare {{the effect of}} feeding either fat or additional corn during late gestation on subsequent pig performance. Beginning on day 100 of gestation and until the day of farrowing, sows were fed 6 lb daily of a corn-soybean meal diet top-dressed with either 1 lb of fat or 2. 25 lb of corn. Litter size was equalized within 24 hr of farrowing. Feeding fat <b>to</b> <b>sows</b> during late gestation increased (P<. 05) the number of pigs weaned per litter by. 4 pig compared to feeding additional corn. Sows fed supplemental fat during late gestation weaned heavier litters (P=. 06) compared <b>to</b> <b>sows</b> fed extra corn. These results indicate that feeding fat during late gestation <b>to</b> <b>sows</b> with a high energy intake increased pig survival over that obtained when the same calories were provided with corn...|$|R
5|$|In 1021/22, however, Xiphias, now {{posted at}} Caesarea as strategos of the Anatolic Theme, fell out with Basil II {{because he was}} not allowed to {{accompany}} the Emperor on his campaign against the Kingdom of Georgia. Xiphias allied himself against the Emperor with the magnate Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos, whose father had risen in revolt {{in the early years of}} Basil II's reign. The two men planned to kill Basil, and that one of them should take his place; who it would be remained undecided, but it was mainly Phokas' name and followers that lent the conspiracy weight. The conspiracy was apparently also known and supported by King George I of Georgia, who thus hoped to force Basil to abandon his invasion. When the emperor learned of the plot, however, he did not turn back, but instead sent letters to the two rebel leaders separately, aiming <b>to</b> <b>sow</b> distrust between them. Basil's ploy bore fruit very soon, for on 15 August 1022, Xiphias assassinated Phokas. The latter's supporters dispersed, and the nascent rebellion collapsed. Xiphias was then forced to surrender to the Emperor's envoy, Theophylact Dalassenos, who became the new strategos of the Anatolics.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebellion}} {{of the two}} men {{was particularly}} threatening to the emperor, as it took control over Cappadocia and threatened to cut off his rear and leave him stranded between two enemies. Indeed, the conspirators are said to have been in contact with George I for that purpose. Basil first withdrew to the safety of the fortress of Mazdat, and according to John Skylitzes sent an envoy to the rebel leaders aiming <b>to</b> <b>sow</b> distrust between them, while according to Yahya the emperor appointed as the new governor of the Anatolic Theme Theophylact Dalassenos and sent him to suppress the revolt. Whether the envoy accomplished his task is unknown, but on 15 August 1022, Xiphias arranged a meeting with Phokas, where the latter was murdered by one of Xiphias' servants. Armenian sources however report, rather dubiously, that Phokas was killed by the former king of Vaspurakan, Senekerim-Hovhannes, or his son David, or one of their followers. The severed head was sent to Basil, who mounted it on a stake and put it on public display at Mazdat.|$|E
5|$|With the Buyid troops {{completing}} their {{conquest of the}} Jazira, and unable to seek aid from his cousin Sa'd al-Dawla, who had already acknowledged 'Adud al-Dawla's suzerainty and was under orders to arrest him, Abu Taghlib with his remaining followers crossed the Syrian Desert to the Fatimid-controlled south of Syria. There he became embroiled in the complex power struggles between the Fatimid government and local elites. He endeavoured to gain recognition by the Fatimids as governor of Damascus, but the rebel general al-Qassam, who held the city, repulsed him. Under attack by the Damascenes, and with {{members of his family}} starting to desert him, Abu Taghlib moved further south to the region of Lake Tiberias. Abu Taghlib's ambitions and his contacts with the Fatimids now came to threaten the position of Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah, a Tayy chief and ruler of Ramla. Hoping <b>to</b> <b>sow</b> dissension among the Arab tribes of the area and strengthen Fatimid authority, the Fatimid general Fadl now promised Ramla to Abu Taghlib, who openly allied himself with Mufarrij's rivals, the Banu Uqayl, and attacked Ramla in August 979. Fadl's troops, however, came to the aid of Mufarrij, and in the ensuing battle on 29 August Abu Taghlib was taken captive and executed.|$|E
40|$|Eight, pregnant, {{primiparous}} sows received i. v. {{infusions of}} TRH (5 micro g/kg; TRH group) or physiological saline (0. 9 % NaCl; control group) from day 105 of gestation until farrowing.

40|$|Recent {{research}} at the University of Nebraska suggest that feeding sows high level of fat (15 - 20 %) during late gestation and lactation may increase energy stores in the newborn pig and increase their survival.

40|$|Cull sow {{physical}} conditions {{were associated with}} on-farm production records. Sows (923) within one integrated U. S. production system were evaluated at two harvest facilities. Physical conditions evaluated at harvest were analyzed by parity, culling code and production measures. Farm culling codes were categorized into poor body condition (BC), old age (G), lameness (L), other (O), poor litter performance (P) and reproductive failure (R). Production measures included lifetime pigs born alive (LPBA), pigs born alive in the last litter (PBALL), pigs per sow per year (PSY) and weaning to culling interval. The L culling code had a greater (P < 0. 05) prevalence of cracked hooves {{when compared to the}} other five culling codes (30. 9 % vs. 18. 7 %). Sows without front cracked hooves tended (P = 0. 07) to have greater PSY (0. 80) when compared <b>to</b> <b>sows</b> having front cracked hooves. Females without rear digital overgrowth had more (P < 0. 05) PBALL (0. 54) and tended (P = 0. 06) to have increased PSY (0. 80) when compared <b>to</b> <b>sows</b> with rear digital overgrowth. Sows without shoulder lesions had greater (P < 0. 05) LPBA (2. 01) when compared <b>to</b> <b>sows</b> with shoulder lesions.

5|$|The Arab {{army was}} well-provisioned, with Arab {{accounts}} reporting high mounds of supplies {{piled up in}} their camp, and had even brought along wheat <b>to</b> <b>sow</b> and harvest the next year. The failure of the Arab navy to blockade the city, however, meant that the Byzantines too could ferry in provisions. In addition, the Arab army had already devastated the Thracian countryside during its march and could not rely on it for foraging. The Arab fleet and the second Arab army, which operated in the Asian suburbs of Constantinople, were able to bring in limited supplies to Maslama's army. As the siege drew into winter, negotiations opened between the two sides, extensively reported by Arab sources but ignored by Byzantine historians. According to the Arab accounts, Leo continued to play a double game with the Arabs. One version claims that he tricked Maslama into handing over most of his grain supplies, while another claims that the Arab general was persuaded to burn them altogether, so as to show {{the inhabitants of the}} city that they faced an imminent assault and induce them to surrender. The winter of 718 was extremely harsh; snow covered the ground for over three months. As the supplies in the Arab camp ran out, a terrible famine broke out: the soldiers ate their horses, camels, and other livestock, and the bark, leaves and roots of trees. They swept the snow of the fields they had sown to eat the green shoots, and reportedly resorted to cannibalism and eating their own excrement. Consequently, the Arab army was ravaged by epidemics; with great exaggeration, the Lombard historian Paul the Deacon put the number of their dead of hunger and disease at 300,000.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the thesis}} was to analyze {{reproductive}} performance of sows in a selected breeding facility during a three-year period. 602 litters of the breed Czech Large White pig (CLW), 7 632 litters of the Czech Large White the Czech Landrace pig (CL) and 397 litters of the Czech Landrace Czech Large White were included in my observation. The average number of born piglets 15. 43 was reached in the basic set of sows, out of which there were 14. 25 live-born piglets. The highest number of all born piglets was found in CL CLW (16. 25 pcs), followed by CLW (16. 03 pcs) and CLW CL (15. 34 pcs). The highest number of live-born piglets was found in CLW (14. 51 pcs), then with a slight gap followed CL CLW (14. 36 pcs) and the lowest number was found in CLW CL (14. 22 pcs). The average age at first conception of sows was 235. 7 days. Sows, younger than 229 days at first conception gave birth to 0. 39 piglets more than sows of the age 230 - 250 days at first conception (13. 42 or 13. 03 piglets). The average gestation length was 115. 7 days. More piglets were born <b>to</b> <b>sows</b> with gestation length shorter than 115 days, than <b>to</b> <b>sows</b> with gestation length 115 days and more (14. 55 or 14. 18). The difference of 0. 37 piglets was statistically confirmed as highly relevant. The average length of weaning-to-conception interval was 5 days (4. 97). More piglets (by 0. 44) were born <b>to</b> <b>sows</b> that were serviced within 4 days after weaning, than <b>to</b> <b>sows</b> serviced within 5 and more days (15. 03 or 14. 58). The difference was confirmed as statistically highly relevant. The average length of farrowing interval was found 152. 9 days. Sows were categorized into three groups based on this interval, 132145 days, 146 - 160 days and 161200 days. Most piglets were born <b>to</b> <b>sows</b> with farrowing interval 146160 days (14. 58) and least <b>to</b> <b>sows</b> with farrowing interval 161200 days (14. 51) ...|$|R
40|$|Sows {{lying on}} their piglets {{causing them to}} be crushed is {{a major cause of}} piglet mortality.
