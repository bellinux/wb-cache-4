5|$|Although the two clubs {{claimed to}} have sold most of the 42,000 tickets {{allocated}} to them, only about 25,000 fans {{were said to have}} travelled to Moscow from the United Kingdom, with about 110 charter flights arriving ahead of the game. According {{to the head of the}} Russian national tourist office, Mikhail Ignatiev, many fans were put off by the cost of <b>travel</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation.</b> Additionally, most of Moscow's hotels were full on the night of the game. As some fans looked to offload tickets to the match, The Moscow Times reported that the black-market price dropped from a high of €2,000 (£1,600) to around €500 (£400), while Russian TV channel Sport-1 was reporting prices as low as £300 for tickets belonging to fans who had failed to make the trip to Moscow. Among the celebrities who did not travel were Chelsea supporter and chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) Sebastian Coe, who had to attend meetings ahead of the 2012 Summer Olympics, and Manchester United fan and Simply Red lead singer Mick Hucknall, who was due to perform at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{itinerant}} royal court comprised various parts. At {{the heart}} was Henry's domestic household, called the domus; a wider grouping was termed the familia regis, and formal gatherings {{of the court}} were termed curia. The domus was divided into several parts. The chapel, headed by the chancellor, looked after the royal documents, the chamber dealt with financial affairs and the master-marshal was responsible for <b>travel</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation.</b> The familia regis included Henry's mounted household troops, up to several hundred strong, who came from {{a wider range of}} social backgrounds, and could be deployed across England and Normandy as required. Initially Henry continued his father's practice of regular crown-wearing ceremonies at his curia, but they became less frequent as the years passed. Henry's court was grand and ostentatious, financing the construction of large new buildings and castles with a range of precious gifts on display, including the King's private menagerie of exotic animals, which he kept at Woodstock Palace. Despite being a lively community, Henry's court was more tightly controlled than those of previous kings. Strict rules controlled personal behaviour and prohibited members of the court from pillaging neighbouring villages, as had been the norm under William Rufus.|$|E
5|$|Luton Town Football Club {{was formed}} on 11 April 1885, {{the product of}} a merger of the two leading local teams, Luton Town Wanderers and Excelsior. Initially based at Excelsior's Dallow Lane ground, the club began making {{payments}} to certain individual players in 1890. The following year, Luton became the first club in southern England to be fully professional. The club was a founder member of the Southern Football League in the 1894–95 season and finished as runners-up in its first two seasons. It then left to help form the United League and came second in that league's inaugural season before joining the Football League (then based mostly in northern and central England) for 1897–98, concurrently moving to a new ground at Dunstable Road. The club continued to enter a team to the United League for two more seasons, and won the title in 1897–98. Poor attendance, high wages and the high <b>travel</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation</b> costs that resulted from Luton's distance from the northern heartlands of the Football League crippled the club financially, and made it too expensive to compete in that league. A return to the Southern League was therefore arranged for the 1900–01 season.|$|E

As amateur players, they should only have been claiming reasonable expenses for <b>travel</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation</b> but they were accused of claiming inflated expenses and appearance fees. The matter came to a head after Surrey County Cricket Club refused to meet their expense claims when Gloucestershire played at The Oval in June. Prior to the same match, Grace was accused of [...] "kidnapping" [...] the Australian player Billy Midwinter when he insisted that Midwinter was contractually bound to play for Gloucestershire and not the Australian touring team.

500|$|The {{controversy}} rumbled on {{and there}} was a long debate in the press through the winter of 1878–79 about the various payments received by the [...] "amateurs" [...] of Gloucestershire. The enquiry at Gloucestershire CCC took place in January 1879. W. G. and E. M. Grace were forced to answer charges that they had claimed [...] "exorbitant expenses", {{one of the few times}} that their money-making activity was seriously challenged. The claim had been submitted to Surrey re the controversial 1878 match in which Billy Midwinter was brought in as a late replacement, but Surrey refused to pay it and this provoked the enquiry. The Graces managed to survive [...] "a protracted and stormy meeting" [...] with E. M. retaining his key post as club secretary, although he was forced to liaise in future with a new finance committee and abide by stricter rules. The incident served to highlight an ongoing issue about the nominal amateur status of the Grace brothers. Like all amateur players, they claimed expenses for <b>travel</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation</b> to and from cricket matches, but there is plenty of evidence that the Graces made rather more money by playing than their basic expenses would allow and W.

2500|$|While {{the gentlemen}} {{were happy to}} play in the same team as the professionals, a form of {{apartheid}} was created off the field (e.g., separate changing rooms and gateways as mentioned above).

The concept was a reflection not only of social status but also of the military mindset which perceived three separate classes: officers, sergeants and the so-called [...] "other ranks". That classification was even extended to marriage in terms of [...] "officers and their ladies, sergeants and their wives, other ranks and their women".|$|E
2500|$|After {{their father}} died in December 1871, W.

G. and £15 to Fred (i.e., about £900 and £450 respectively per match in 2013 terms). Since W. G. averaged ten USEE appearances per season through the 1870s, he was potentially receiving £10,000 per season in 2013 terms. This was not the end of it because he claimed appearance fees whenever he guested for another team, rightly adjudging himself to be the main attraction who was bringing in the crowds; and he claimed what he termed his [...] "expenses" [...] whenever he took part in a first-class match. By the standards of the time, cricket was a lucrative business for the Graces, especially considering that they held amateur status.|$|E

However, in his later years he had to pay for a locum tenens to run his medical practice while he was playing cricket and he had a reputation for treating his poorer patients without charging a fee. He was paid a salary for his roles as secretary and manager of the London County club. He was the recipient of two national testimonials.
