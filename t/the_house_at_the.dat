Lyons gave incorrect information about the precise location of the killings and about the number of weapons used.

5|$|Wagner's role at Ludwig's court became controversial; in particular, Ludwig's {{habit of}} {{referring}} Wagner's policy ideas to his ministers alarmed the court. When Wagner demanded the sacking both of Ludwig's cabinet secretary {{and of his}} prime minister, there was a public outcry, and in December 1865 Ludwig reluctantly told Wagner to leave Bavaria. The king did not, however, withdraw his patronage or financial support. After a few months' wandering, in March 1866 Wagner arrived in Geneva, where Cosima joined him. They travelled together to Lucerne where they found a large lakeside house, the Villa Tribschen. Wagner made immediate arrangements to rent <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> king's expense, and by 15 April was installed in his new home.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Vives {{waking up and}} seeing two women in the bed with him. He remembers being seduced by them when he was drunk the night before. Realizing this, he packs his {{belongings}} and leaves the house. He is seen driving a car until it runs out fuel which forces him to travel by foot where he eventually arrives at a town. In another house, a woman (played by Fabi√°n) wakes up recalling the events of her abusive husband (played by Zamora). She enters a church and says a prayer. Later, Vives is seen hanging out with two men at an outdoor bar when he spots the woman whom he immediately becomes smitten with. Afterwards, he {{and the two men}} are fishing on a boat when Vives sees the woman again. He begins having illusions of him and the woman having a happy life together which drives him insane in his room. That night, the woman finds her husband making love to another woman in a car. Upon discovering this, she leaves <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, the town is holding a festival where Vives is celebrating with the townsfolk.
