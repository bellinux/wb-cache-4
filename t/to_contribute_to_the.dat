5|$|Disruptions in the plantar fascia's normal {{mechanical}} movement during standing and walking (known as the Windlass mechanism) are thought <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of plantar fasciitis by placing excess {{strain on the}} calcaneal tuberosity. Other studies have also suggested that plantar fasciitis is not actually due to inflamed plantar fascia, but may be a tendon injury involving the flexor digitorum brevis muscle located immediately deep to the plantar fascia.|$|E

Situated in the Georgian/Victorian suburb of Clifton, Bristol, it provides self-catering accommodation for around 340 residents, both in the main hall itself and also {{in a number of}} nearby surrounding annexes.

The prize money came from a casino in San Remo after Francesco Sghirla, a former Gazzetta employee, encouraged them <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> race.

5|$|The Jyllands-Posten Muhammad {{cartoons}} controversy (or Muhammad cartoons crisis) (Danish: Muhammedkrisen) {{began after}} the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published 12 editorial cartoons on 30 September 2005, {{most of which}} depicted Muhammad, the principal figure of the religion of Islam. The newspaper announced {{that this was an}} attempt <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> debate about criticism of Islam and self-censorship.

5|$|When World War II began, Teller wanted <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> war effort. On {{the advice}} of the {{well-known}} Caltech aerodynamicist and fellow Hungarian émigré Theodore von Kármán, Teller collaborated with his friend Hans Bethe in developing a theory of shock-wave propagation. In later years, their explanation of the behavior of the gas behind such a wave proved valuable to scientists who were studying missile re-entry.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{study of}} tansy beetle {{occupancy}} amongst 1305 patches (stems separated by {{no more than}} 50cm) of the tansy plant {{on the banks of the}} River Ouse (York, UK) intended to establish data on the distribution of tansy plants and relate this to existing tansy beetle populations in order <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conservation effort of the species. The results were analysed using generalised additive models to conclude that the tansy patches should be managed towards volumes of 3m and that these patches should be targeted within 200m of existing beetle subpopulations on the same river bank in order to help the beetle population disperse and survive.|$|E
5|$|At Shimer, the {{professor}} is a facilitator, a guide on the side, not a sage {{on the stage}} – encouraging each student <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> intellectual light being kindled in every class. Each student is expected to question and comment upon the text, to respond to one other’s insights, actively taking part in every discussion.... Students know their insights matter; they have something to offer to their peers, and {{to the life of}} the text being discussed. Some students are more exuberant than others, some would rather talk than listen; others may be a bit shy. The professor/facilitator must make sure that each student has a chance to shine, that each can feel confident, each can have the courage to ask what they think might be a stupid question. What are feared to be stupid questions are often the most provocative ones.|$|E

5|$|Development of Ant-Man {{began in}} April 2006, with {{the hiring of}} Wright to direct and co-write with Cornish. By April 2011, Wright and Cornish had {{completed}} three drafts of the script and Wright shot test footage for the film in July 2012. Pre-production began in October 2013 after being put on hold so that Wright could complete The World's End. Casting began in December 2013, with the hiring of Rudd to play Lang. In May 2014, Wright left the project, citing creative differences, though he still received screenplay and story credits with Cornish, {{as well as an}} executive producer credit. The following month, Reed was brought in to replace Wright, while McKay was hired <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> script with Rudd.

5|$|Hayes {{hoped to}} remain out of {{politics}} {{in order to pay}} off the debts he had incurred during the Panic, but when the Republican state convention nominated him for governor in 1875, he accepted. The campaign against Democratic nominee William Allen focused primarily on Protestant fears of the possibility of state aid to Catholic schools. Hayes was against such funding and, while he was not known to be personally anti-Catholic, he allowed anti-Catholic fervor <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> enthusiasm for his candidacy. The campaign was a success, and Hayes was returned to the governorship by a 5,544-vote majority. The first person to earn a third term as Governor of Ohio, Hayes reduced the state debt, re-established the Board of Charities, and repealed the Geghan Bill, which had allowed for the appointment of Catholic priests to schools and penitentiaries.|$|E
5|$|Henry did {{not give}} up on his hopes for a crusade, but became {{increasingly}} absorbed {{in a bid to}} acquire the wealthy Kingdom of Sicily for his son Edmund. Sicily had been controlled by Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire, for many years a rival of Pope Innocent IV. On Frederick's death in 1250, Innocent started to look for a new ruler, one more amenable to the Papacy. Henry saw Sicily as both a valuable prize for his son and as an excellent base for his crusading plans in the east. With minimal consultation within his court, Henry came to an agreement with the Pope in 1254 that Edmund should be the next king. Innocent urged Henry to send Edmund with an army to reclaim Sicily from Frederick's son Manfred, offering <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> expenses of the campaign.|$|E
