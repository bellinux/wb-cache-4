5|$|In December 2016, a homebrew remake was {{released}} that, {{for the most}} part, kept the original game the same. However, <b>the</b> <b>mechanic</b> of E.T. falling into the pit was amended so that a keypress was required before the player fell into the pit. The holes were also visually removed and were discovered with an indicator at the bottom left of the screen.|$|E
5|$|Life Is Strange is {{a graphic}} {{adventure}} played from a third-person view. <b>The</b> <b>mechanic</b> of rewinding time allows the player to redo any action {{that has been}} taken. The player can examine and interact with objects, which enables puzzle solving {{in the form of}} fetch quests and making changes to the environment. Items that are collected before time travelling will be kept in the inventory after the fact.|$|E
5|$|On 16 June 1944, while 8./JG 1 {{was moving}} from Le Mans to Essay, France {{came under attack}} by the P-51s of 354th Fighter Wing, near Alençon. In the ensuing dogfight, 8./JG 1 lost three pilots and one {{mechanic}} riding passenger. Those were Uffz. Günther Henschel, Uffz. Franz Zechner, and Feldwebel Helmuth Heidemann. <b>The</b> <b>mechanic</b> was Uffz. Herbert Redlich. Also lost were two other aircraft without loss of life.|$|E

5|$|At the FBI Academy, Dana Scully reads Mulder's initial report. The only {{connection}} between the murders that he can see is that the suspects all destroyed an electronic device during the killings. Meanwhile, Bonnie McRoberts, another Franklin resident, drops by a repair shop {{to pick up her}} car, where a message on an engine diagnostic display warns her that <b>the</b> <b>mechanic</b> is going to rape her. She impulsively kills him with an oil can spout. When Mulder and Spencer question her the next morning, her kitchen microwave instructs her to kill them. When she grabs a knife and attacks Mulder, she is shot and killed by Spencer.|$|E

The other pilots remonstrated with Baker, but he maintained that as commanding officer he could not let anyone else test the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Thayer School {{is located}} on the campus of Dartmouth College, which is {{situated}} in the rural, Upper Valley New England town of Hanover, New Hampshire. The campus of the Thayer School sits in a complex on the west side Dartmouth's campus near the Connecticut River. When classes first began in 1871, Sylvanus Thayer's endowment had not provided for a physical plant. Consequently, the school was an itinerant institution for many years, occupying parts of various College buildings and, at one point, a former structure of the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and <b>the</b> <b>Mechanic</b> Arts.|$|E
5|$|The route turns {{south at}} Cedar Street, {{following}} the residential street into downtown Akron. Here, NY93 intersects with CR573 (John Street) at a junction {{that was once}} the western terminus of NY267. At this intersection, NY93 heads west on John Street for one block before continuing south on Buffalo Street for another block to Main Street. NY93 turns westward again, following Main Street through the westernmost part of Akron's central business district prior to curving southwestward at a junction with Mechanic Street. The highway takes on <b>the</b> <b>Mechanic</b> Street name as it crosses over Murder Creek and leaves downtown Akron. Just south of the creek, NY93 changes names to Buell Street at an intersection with Jackson Street.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Cassin Kinkaid {{was born}} in Hanover, New Hampshire, on 3 April 1888, the second child and only son of Thomas Wright Kinkaid, a naval officer, and his wife Virginia Lee née Cassin. At the time, Thomas Wright Kinkaid was on leave from the U.S. Navy and {{employed}} at the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and <b>the</b> <b>Mechanic</b> Arts. When Thomas was only a year old, his father was posted to , and {{the family moved to}} Sitka, Alaska, where a third child, Dorothy, {{was born in}} 1890. Over the next few years the family successively moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Norfolk, Virginia; Annapolis, Maryland and Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} {{previous}} The Legend of Zelda games, solving puzzles and clearing dungeons remains a fundamental {{part of the}} gameplay. Progression through A Link Between Worlds is more open-ended than previous titles, {{with the possibility of}} tackling many of the game's dungeons in any order. Certain dungeon obstacles will require the use of the rented or purchased items. Towards the end of each dungeon, Link will encounter a boss that must be defeated. A unique mechanic that the game introduces is Link's ability to merge onto walls and move horizontally along them. Link is presented as a mural when he is merged on a wall, and upon merging, the game's perspective shifts to a side view to follow Link around corners. While merged to a wall, Link's energy gauge will deplete. <b>The</b> <b>mechanic</b> can be used for traversing the environment, reaching seemingly inaccessible areas, and avoiding hazards. It {{plays a key role in}} solving many of the game's puzzles and dungeons. Wall merging is also used as a means for travelling between Hyrule and Lorule, via fissures that connect the two kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|Remember Me {{features}} platforming, {{exploration and}} melee combat. The {{game is played}} as Nilin from a third-person view and introduces <b>the</b> <b>mechanic</b> of memory remixing: entering and rearranging a target's memories to manipulate them. Players accomplish this by replaying a memory and modifying details to change the target's recollection of the outcome. Another key mechanic of the gameplay is stealing memories from certain targets and using points called Remembranes to replay the memory in real-time: this is often needed to proceed through the game or avoid hazards otherwise hidden from the player. When the player is low on health, the screen will glitch until a sufficient amount of health is regained. On occasion, Nilin encounters puzzles {{in the form of}} riddles she must solve to unlock doors so as to further progress in the story.|$|E
50|$|From the {{perspective}} of <b>the</b> designer, <b>the</b> <b>mechanics</b> generate dynamics which generate aesthetics. This relationship poses a challenge for the game designer as they are only able to influence <b>the</b> <b>mechanics</b> and only through them can be produced meaningful dynamics and aesthetics for the player.The perspective of the player is the other way around. They experience the game through the aesthetics, which the game dynamics provide, which emerged from <b>the</b> <b>mechanics.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mechanics</b> {{of human}} {{sexuality}} or mechanics of sex, or more formally the biomechanics {{of human sexuality}}, {{is the study of}} <b>the</b> <b>mechanics</b> related to human sexual activity. Examples of topics include the biomechanical study of the strength of vaginal tissues and the biomechanics of male erectile function. <b>The</b> <b>mechanics</b> of sex under limit circumstances, such as sexual activity at zero-gravity in outer space, are also being studied.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mechanics</b> Monument, {{also known}} as <b>The</b> <b>Mechanics,</b> Mechanics Statue, or Mechanics Fountain since it {{featured}} {{a pool of water}} at the base during the first five years, is a bronze sculpture group by Douglas Tilden, located at the intersection of Market, Bush and Battery Streets in San Francisco, California, United States.|$|R
5|$|All puzzles {{are based}} on a {{mechanic}} of tracing a path through a maze-like route from a starting point, represented as a circle, to a goal point, represented as a line segment with a rounded end, without crossing one's path. The goal of these puzzles is not always to simply complete the maze but to find the right path that completes the puzzle correctly. Mazes may have several starting points and goals; the player may have to find the right starting point that can complete the maze, or they may {{have to figure out how}} to reach a specific end point to trigger an event in the surrounding environment such as moving a platform. The puzzles include a symbolic language that denotes the mechanics for that maze. For example, puzzles that present mazes with black and white squares in the spaces between traceable paths require the player to find a path through the maze that separates these squares by color. Other puzzles require the player to use the environment to determine how to solve the puzzle, such as studying a nearby tree with branches that mimic the puzzle, or by observing symbols on nearby floors and walls that align with the puzzle's configuration. The puzzles within each island section {{are based on}} common mechanic, often with a sequence of puzzles appearing early in each section that are designed to help the player identify and understand <b>the</b> <b>mechanic</b> and meaning of the symbols. Later puzzles combine two or more different mechanics into the same puzzle using the consistent symbolic language.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Lightning Returns battle system {{originated}} while ideas were being discussed for the battle system in Final Fantasy XIII, but technical limitations and problems implementing it in a party-based battle system prevented {{it from being}} used in that game. It reemerged {{when some of the}} development team wanted Lightning to change her appearance during battle, and reducing to one playable character opened up the memory space necessary for such a system to be implemented. In making the system revolve around one character, the developers ended up removing any opportunity for story scenes between party members, which was cited by Abe as its main weakness. The time limit sprang from the story concept of a world with a set time to live. When the feature was first announced, there were some who felt it was too new a thing, as a time limit was seen as a taboo in role-playing video games. <b>The</b> <b>mechanic</b> originally received negative feedback from test players who were unable to complete the game in time. In response to this, the team made adjustments so that players were given a more comfortable amount of time. Along with sharing design elements with the previous two XIII games, the system also bears similarities to the battle system of Final Fantasy XV, although the developers said that they were not directly inspired by it.|$|E

5000|$|The team got a major boost {{during their}} first year when a lockout wiped out the 2004-05 NHL season, thus leaving <b>the</b> <b>Mechanics</b> <b>the</b> only {{professional}} hockey team in the Detroit market. <b>The</b> <b>Mechanics</b> signed three Detroit Red Wings players: Chris Chelios, Derian Hatcher, and Kris Draper. All three players had local ties; Hatcher had even played at the Mechanics' arena as a youth. However, due to visa problems, Kris Draper (a Canadian) never played a game for <b>the</b> <b>Mechanics.</b> Later, Motor City also signed Bryan Smolinski and Sean Avery, suiting up four active NHL players, {{more than any other}} North American pro team during the lockout. Despite the signings, however, <b>the</b> <b>Mechanics</b> barely played [...]500 hockey and missed the playoffs.|$|R
40|$|Local {{buckling}} of a delaminated {{group of}} plies {{can lead to}} higher interlaminar stresses and delamination growth. <b>The</b> <b>mechanics</b> of instability-related delamination growth (IRDG) had been described previously for the through-width delamination. This paper describes <b>the</b> <b>mechanics</b> of IRDG for the embedded delamination subjected to either uniaxial or axisymmetric loads. <b>The</b> <b>mechanics</b> of IRDG are used to explain the dramatic differences in strain-energy release rates observed for the through-width, the axisymmetrically loaded embedded delamination, and the uniaxially loaded embedded delamination...|$|R
25|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} faulty air temperature probe (the total air temperature sensor, located {{on the front of}} the aircraft near the cockpit) that initially caused the pilot to turn the plane back for maintenance before the second takeoff attempt. <b>The</b> <b>mechanic</b> simply deactivated the probe because the aircraft's Minimum Equipment List allowed it to be left inoperative. On 22 August investigators interviewed <b>the</b> <b>mechanic,</b> who defended his action by saying that it had nothing to do with the crash. Spanair has supported the mechanic's view that deactivation of the probe is an accepted procedure. On 1 September a report, quoting Spanair, stated that the problem detected on the first takeoff attempt was overheating caused by a temperature gauge's de-icing system, rather than a dysfunction of the temperature gauge itself, and that since icing was not a risk on that flight, the de-icing system had been deactivated by <b>the</b> <b>mechanic</b> with captain's approval.|$|E
25|$|If {{a person}} (licensed repair facility) has repaired, {{furnished}} supplies or materials, towed or stored a vehicle {{and has not}} been paid for the services rendered, that person has a lien against the vehicle. The lien arises at the time the registered owner is presented with a written statement of charges for completed work or services. Although if services were performed that were not agreed upon and no written and signed estimate was issued beforehand, a mechanic has no right to keep the title owner from reclaiming the vehicle. If a mechanic asserts a fee that is not reasonably related to the work performed, and refuses to return the vehicle until that price is paid, the owner of the vehicle will be able to recoup a storage fee from <b>the</b> <b>mechanic,</b> as <b>the</b> <b>mechanic</b> is in the wrong for refusing to return the vehicle. In doing so <b>the</b> <b>mechanic</b> would commit the crime of conversion, or embezzlement.|$|E
