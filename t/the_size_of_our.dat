25|$|On 15 September 2011, astronomers, {{using data}} from NASA's Kepler spacecraft, {{announced}} the first partial-eclipse-based discovery of a circumbinary planet. The planet, called Kepler-16b, is about 200 light years from Earth, in the constellation Cygnus, and {{is believed to be}} a frozen world of rock and gas, about the mass of Saturn. It orbits two stars that are also circling each other, one about two-thirds <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> sun, the other about a fifth <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> sun. Each orbit of the stars by the planet takes 229 days, while the planet orbits the system's center of mass every 225 days; the stars eclipse each other every three weeks or so.|$|E

The galaxy is {{receding}} from us at about 1109km/s. The galaxy is a typical spiral galaxy, similar to our Milky Way. It harbors a supermassive black hole at its core and has massive regions of star formation in the bright blue knots in the spiral arms. Supernovae {{are likely to be}} found within these regions.|$|E

2500|$|In addition, {{there were}} {{divisions}} within the Japanese government between one faction that {{wanted to use the}} crisis to start a war with Britain and another that argued that since the war with China was already compounded the border war with the Soviet Union, starting a third war at this time was unwise. Even more astonishing to the Japanese Army who expected an easy triumph, the Red Army defeated them at the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, which came as a great shock and caused many Japanese generals to lose their bellicosity, if only for a moment. The Japanese Foreign Minister Hachirō Arita regularly met with Cragie and by 22 July 1939 felt that he was winning in his talks. On 26 July 1939, the United States gave the six-month notification that it would not renew the 1911 Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which increased the amount of economic pressure the British could bring against Japan. The Roosevelt administration had carried its version of appeasement in the Far East, but actions such as the Tientsin incident had persuaded the Americans that Japan was out of control, and the United States needed to start applying economic pressure via such moves like cancelling the 1911 treaty to pressure the Japanese to stop challenging the existing international order in Asia. The Showa Emperor was furious, telling his aide-de-camp Hata Shunroku: [...] "It could be a great blow to scrap metal and oil. Even if we can purchase [...] for the next six months, we will immediately have difficulties thereafter. Unless we reduce <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> army and navy by one-third, we won't make it...They [...] should have prepared for something like this a long time ago. It's unacceptable for them to be making a commotion about it now." [...] The American historian Herbert Bix wrote it was typical of the Emperor to criticize his generals and admirals for not anticipating the American move and preparing for it, instead of considering ending the war with China that had brought about the cancellation of the 1911 treaty.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} {{deterministic}} number theoretic construction for matrices with the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). Furthermore, {{we show that}} the number theoretic properties <b>of</b> <b>our</b> RIP matrices allow their products with Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) matrices to be well approximated via a few highly sparse matrix multiplications. Hence, our RIP matrices may be approximately multiplied by the DFT of any input vector in sublinear-time by reading {{only a small fraction}} of its entries. As a consequence, we obtain small deterministic sample sets which are guaranteed to allow the recovery of near-optimal sparse Fourier representations for all periodic functions having an integrable second derivative over a single period. Explicit bounds are provided for <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> RIP matrices, <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> their associated sublinear Fourier sampling sets, and the errors incurred by quickly approximating their products with DFT matrices.

6000|$|The {{advantage}} of the square-rig over the fore-and-aft rig is, that the sails, being smaller and more numerous, are more easily managed, and require fewer men or [...] "hands" [...] to work them. Thus, as we increase <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> vessel, the more necessity is there {{that it should be}} square-rigged. The huge main-sail of the sloop and schooner could not be applied to large vessels; so that when men came to construct ships of several hundred tons burden, they were compelled {{to increase the number of}} masts and sails, and diminish the size of them; hence, probably, brigs were devised after schooners. The main-mast of a brig is the aft one.|$|E

The day, which had hitherto been agreeable, now became oppressively sultry: not a breath of wind ruffled the water; and as the sun shone down with intense heat from a perfectly cloudless sky, it became almost insufferable. I tried all methods to cool myself, by lying in every position I could think of, sometimes even hanging both legs and arms over the sides of the canoe and trailing them through the water. I had a racking headache, and, to add to my misery, as the sun sank the mosquitoes rose and bit ferociously.
