25|$|Tbilisi obtains {{most of its}} {{drinking}} water from the basin of the Aragvi River north of the city. Groundwater (60% of the total) is pumped from well fields, while surface water (40%) is mostly obtained from the reservoir of the Zhinvali Dam 42km from the city. The water is treated in two plants: the Samgori plant built in the 1950s and the Grmagele plant, located at the Zhinvali Dam, built in the 1980s. The length of the water distribution network in Tbilisi is 3,600km. About 35% of the main network is made of iron pipes and 65% of steel pipes. Polyethylene pipes have been installed only recently. There are 84 reservoirs and 169 pumps. The sewer network consists of 1,600km of pipes made of ceramic, reinforced concrete, cast iron, asbestos cement and polyethylene. The wastewater is transferred by <b>trunk</b> <b>sewer</b> with a length of 72km to the Gardabani {{waste water treatment plant}} commissioned in 1979 with a capacity of 1 million m3/day. The biological treatment at the plant is not in operation due to its high energy consumption and the associated high cost. The untreated wastewater is discharged into the Kura River.|$|E
25|$|Past {{projects}} {{financed by}} KfW include a water supply project in Wadi Musa; an integrated poverty-oriented project targeted at refugees and squatters which included investments in {{water supply and}} sanitation; sewage disposal for Greater Irbid; and a <b>trunk</b> <b>sewer</b> and associated pumping stations linking up to the wastewater treatment plant As-Samra near Amman. In Wadi Musa the Euro 11.3 million project achieved, for a brief period, continuous water supply {{as well as a}} reduction in distribution losses. The project was co-financed by France and, concerning sanitation, by the US. The Euro 16.3 m poverty-oriented infrastructure project implemented by the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) of Jordan increased access to water and sanitation in two squatter settlements and four refugee camps. The investments in the camps were chosen in close dialogue with the residents who were organized in Community Improvement Committees, and were carried out between 1999 and 2002. The project complemented the World Bank-financed Community Infrastructure Development Project. The Euro 60.1 m Greater Irbid sewage disposal project (1994–2002) included the construction of two wastewater treatment plants and the associated sewer infrastructure connecting 202,000 residents, as well as training for operational staff. Both treatment plants operated satisfactorily four years after they had been completed. Residual sludge is being properly disposed on a landfill.|$|E
2500|$|Japan {{provided}} a soft loan (25 years maturity, 7 grace years, 2.5% interest) of about US$120m for wastewater collection and treatment in Sidon and water supply in Keserwan District in 1996. In Sidon {{the project was}} to finance a sewer network with a length of 38km, a <b>trunk</b> <b>sewer</b> with a length of 7km, two sewage pumping stations and a preliminary treatment plant with a capacity of 33,600m3/day. [...] Later the design was changed to add the financing of a 2km sea outfall, increase {{the capacity of the}} treatment plant to 45,000 m3/day, increase the number of pumping stations to 13 and to reduce the length of sewers financed. The construction of the wastewater treatment plant was finished in 2006, but it became operational only in 2010 when {{at least some of the}} trunk sewers were finally connected to the plant. In Keserwan District Japan finances the expansion of a water intake at the Al Madiq spring, 50km of transmission mains, 13 pumping stations 22 service reservoirs and 202km of distribution mains. The project will alleviate water scarcity in a number of villages where demand is twice as high as available supply. As of 2008, a centerpiece of the project—a 4km tunnel with a diameter of almost 4m—was under construction.|$|E
50|$|Pipes {{conveying}} sewage from {{an individual}} building to a common gravity sewer line are called laterals. Branch sewers typically run under streets receiving laterals from buildings along that street and discharge by gravity into <b>trunk</b> <b>sewers</b> at manholes. Larger cities may have sewers called interceptors receiving flow from multiple <b>trunk</b> <b>sewers.</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{methods are}} most {{suitable}} for <b>trunk</b> <b>sewers,</b> since repair of lines with lateral connections is complicated by making provisions to receive lateral flows without accepting undesirable infiltration from inadequately sealed junctions.|$|R

2500|$|King County built a {{stormwater}} {{control system}} in Boeing Creek Park. A large detention basin stores water during storms, reducing the creek's flood risk. The detention basin is augmented by an underground storage pipe designed to temporarily store up to 500,000 gallons of wastewater during large storms. This storage pipe is located under the detention basin in Boeing Creek Park. The pipe is [...] {{in diameter and}} about [...] long. Completed in 2007 by King County Public Works, the pipe's purpose is to help keep wastewater within the sewer system and reduce overflows into Puget Sound. The pipe conveys wastewater to the Hidden Lake Pump Station. At {{the same time the}} Hidden Lake Pump Station, located on Hidden Lake, was replaced in order to increase capacity. The old pump station lacked capacity, resulting in about three overflows into Puget Sound per year. Another related wastewater projet is the [...] Boeing Creek <b>Trunk</b> <b>Sewer</b> Replacement. A major wastewater conveyance pipe, the Boeing Creek Trunk (BCT) was under capacity and had deteriorated with age. During heavy rain storms wastewater sometimes overflowed from manholes and into Puget Sound. These projects were all part of the Hidden Lake Pump Station replacement and sewer improvement project. Construction of this overall project began in 2006. The underground storage pipe in Boeing Creek Park was finished in 2007, Boeing Creek Trunk in 2008, and the Hidden Lake Pump Station in 2009. All of these wastewater systems are located very close to Boeing Creek, although the Boeing Creek Trunk extends north out of the creek's watershed. The City of Shoreline is planning additional stormwater management projects to reduce flooding and improve Boeing Creek's hydrology. Construction of the Pan Terra Pond and Pump Improvement Project began in 2009.|$|E

25|$|By the 1940s, urban {{development}} had expanded beyond {{the borders of}} the City of Toronto. Planning studies anticipated that the townships and villages surrounding Toronto would be the scene of any future growth. However, spending to build any capital projects was limited by the lack of capital borrowing ability of the suburbs. The <b>trunk</b> <b>sewers</b> and sewage treatment plant for the Don Mills development was financed by its developer, E. P. Taylor, when North York Township could not. Planning boards, including the Toronto and Suburban Planning Board of which Gardiner was chairman, proposed several projects, one being the Spadina Road Extension, which were rejected by the local governments.|$|R

50|$|Decisions {{of these}} bodies {{accordingly}} begin to favor {{people who live}} in suburbs, providing more car-oriented and commuter services and more favorable property tax rates for single family homes as tenants in downtown apartment buildings pay higher rates. In urban areas that are growing rapidly, services may be developed that favor urban sprawl, such as large <b>trunk</b> <b>sewers,</b> express highways or shopping malls, as other services such as youth recreation disappear from downtown areas. This increases population drain to the suburbs as quality of life drops, but the increased population may then drive more people further out to the hinterlands which increases the political rewards (especially political donations from real estate developers building greenfield developments) for sprawl.|$|R
50|$|In 1946, a plan by the Shirriff {{company to}} {{demolish}} pioneer dwellings {{in the area}} of Todmorden Mills led outraged citizens to form the Don Valley Conservation Association volunteer organization.

The Association continued its activities, planting tree seedlings, stopped the picking of wild flowers, particularly trilliums and preventing the vandalism of trees. The Association held educational events to educate the public about the Don Valley, including special trains through the valley, and a recreation of Lt. Governor Simcoe's journey up the Don by canoe. The Association also advocated for the building of <b>trunk</b> <b>sewers</b> to stop the run-off of pollution into the Don.|$|R

Grit is also removed and washed. Some is recycled as a building material, and some goes to landfill. In storm conditions, when the incoming flow exceeds the capacity of the works, some of the sewage is passed through separate storm screens, which perform a similar process, and is stored in storm tanks until the flows reduce, and the contents of the tanks can be processed by the works.|$|R

50|$|Gravity sewer systems {{typically}} {{resemble the}} regional runoff pattern with large <b>trunk</b> <b>sewers</b> in each valley receiving flow from smaller lateral sewers extending up hillsides. Sewer systems within comparatively level terrain require careful planning and construction to minimize energy losses in free falls, sharp bends, or turbulent junctions. Every {{reach of the}} sewer should routinely experience the minimum velocity necessary to maintain solids in suspension and avoid blockage from solids deposition in low-velocity areas. Sewers in hilly areas, however, may require energy dissipation features to avoid sewer damage from high fluid velocities and the scouring effects of gritty solids in turbulent flow. Covered sewers are buried below the frost line to avoid freezing, and deep enough to receive gravity flow from anticipated wastewater sources. Long gravity sewers may require significant excavation depths or tunneling to maintain acceptable gradients near the sewer outfall.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the goal {{programming}} model is given {{that deals with}} the optimal scale and location of an area-wide sewerage system, consisting of <b>trunk</b> <b>sewers,</b> treatment plants, and pumping stations. The uncertainty of future wastewater volume is considered, and the regional objectives are evaluated. Hence, the model is composed of several constraints and of three objective functions (goals). The major constraints are {{the capacity of the}} treatment plants and the estimated range of wastewater amount of each municipality. The goals are to minimize total cost and environmental impact, while maximizing user satisfaction with the sewerage system. The case study shows that this model can help to decide the location and scale of facilities for sewerage system, giving results that are a good balance of the three goals. Furthermore, the analysis, by varying the settings of the goals or the values of sewerage propagation ratio, shows that the model can simulate changes in the wastewater capacity and its transport routes. Thus our model makes it easier for decisionmakers to plan area-wide sewerage systems. ...|$|R
