5|$|On May 27, 2004, a {{judge ruled}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> had {{reasonable}} justification to raid Goliath's. Defense lawyers countered {{that none of}} the anonymous information the police acted uponfor example that live sex shows were being staged and drugs sold on the premisesfeatured in the charges made against the seventeen men. They also pointed out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> failed to call in the force's gay community liaison officer. Goliath's reopened {{a little more than a}} month after the raid.|$|E
5|$|When Dan White {{was found}} guilty of {{involuntary}} manslaughter, his successful diminished capacity defense enraged the gay community. <b>That</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> and fire departments had raised money for his defense gave their anger a focus, turning it against the city government and especially the SFPD.|$|E
5|$|After his release, Money {{immediately}} {{spoke to}} his official contacts, {{and the next morning}} the matter was raised in the House of Commons. It was suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> evidence was perjured, and as a result the Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks instructed Sir Archibald Bodkin, the Director of Public Prosecutions, to investigate the possibility of perjury. Bodkin had the Metropolitan Police Commissioner appoint Chief Inspector Collins, one of his most experienced CID officers, to investigate the claims and interview Savidge.|$|E
50|$|The {{trial judge}} {{dismissed}} Spencer's Charter application, finding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police's</b> request for Spencer's subscriber information {{was not a}} search for the purposes of section 8.|$|R
50|$|In January 2016, {{whistleblower}} Sgt David Williams claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police's</b> “domestic extremism” unit destroyed shredded records “related to” Jones in June 2014, {{the month}} Jones {{met with the}} unit pressing for answers.|$|R
50|$|The state {{trial court}} granted Hicks' motion to {{suppress}} the stereo equipment, and the Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed. It was conceded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police's</b> initial entry into Hicks' apartment was lawful, although it took place without a warrant, because of the emergency created by the shooting. But moving the stereo equipment was an additional search, the appellate court reasoned, which lacked a warrant and was unrelated to <b>the</b> purpose <b>the</b> <b>police</b> were in Hicks' apartment to begin with. The appellate court therefore found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police's</b> actions violated <b>the</b> Fourth Amendment, and affirmed the trial court's granting of the motion to suppress. The Arizona Supreme Court declined the State's request to review the case, but the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to do so.|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of series four, Meyer is shot in a road-rage incident {{on his way to}} work. The culprit is later admitted to the hospital as a patient, when he crashes his car after trying to flee following the shooting. He tries to escape from the hospital in fear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> will discover him, and after three attempts at leaving the hospital, he finally achieves his goal but collapses in the hospital car park and dies.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of {{graduation}} all officers are qualified for operational service. However, each employee must undergo 40 hours of yearly training, including firearms practice, to keep their operational certification. Without this, they cannot patrol, use firearms or participate in actions. Forty-four percent of police officers in 2012 lacked such certification. The main reason is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> districts {{see it as a}} waste of resources to train investigation and administrative staff which do not participate in operative duty, and that a higher quality is achieved through specialization of tasks, such as dedicated investigation personnel.|$|E
5|$|Commissioner Gordon announces <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> {{have arrested}} the Joker's men and unveils the Bat-Signal. Harvey Dent reads {{a note from}} Batman, {{promising}} that he will defend Gotham whenever crime strikes again. Vicki is taken to Wayne Manor by Alfred, who tells her that Bruce {{will be a little}} late. She responds that she is not surprised, as Batman looks at the signal's projection, standing watch over the city.|$|E
5000|$|On 29 June 2010 the Home Secretary Theresa May {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Policing</b> Pledge {{had been}} scrapped by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition [...] {{as a result}} of the emergency budget to reduce the public deficit. This will allow <b>the</b> <b>police</b> to focus more on law enforcement and less on trying to meet targets.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Court found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{doctor and}} {{hospital}} were {{not subject to}} the Charter. It was also found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police's</b> conduct was in violation of section 8, was not justified under section 1, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> evidence should be excluded under section 24(2).|$|R
50|$|After <b>that</b> activity, <b>the</b> <b>police</b> {{came and}} asked the crowd to leave.|$|R
5|$|In July 2015, the Beales are {{informed}} by DI Samantha Keeble (Alison Newman) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> {{have a new}} DCI dealing {{with the murder of}} Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater), who is making an arrest. At Phil's house, Marsden knocks on his door and Phil is shocked to see her. Marsden wants to speak to Ben about Lucy's murder, but Phil slams the door in her face and then attempts to delay Marsden so Ben can flee Walford, but Ben is eventually arrested.|$|E
5|$|In the present, White and Pink beat Nash for information. Eddie {{arrives and}} orders them to {{retrieve}} the diamonds and ditch the getaway vehicles, leaving Blonde in charge of Nash and Orange. Nash denies knowledge, but Blonde ignores him and resumes the torture, cutting off his ear with a straight razor. He is about to set Nash on fire, but is shot dead by Orange. Orange explains to Nash {{that he is an}} undercover police officer and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> will arrive soon.|$|E
5|$|In the present, when Eddie, Pink, and White return, Orange {{tries to}} {{convince}} them that Blonde planned to kill them and steal the diamonds for himself. Eddie kills Nash and accuses Orange of lying, since Blonde was loyal to his father. Joe arrives with news <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> have killed Blue. He is about to execute Orange, but White intervenes and holds Joe at gunpoint. Eddie points his own weapon at White, creating a Mexican standoff. All three shoot; both Cabots are killed, and White and Orange are wounded.|$|E
50|$|Also in April 2016, an {{attempted}} murder suspect, Kerron Andrews, {{filed a lawsuit}} alleging <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police's</b> use of a stingray was an illegal search without a warrant. A Maryland appeals ruled in his favor, upholding the decision made in a lower court.|$|R
50|$|On 14 July, Tan was remanded {{for four}} days by a magistrate, who {{rejected}} <b>the</b> <b>police</b> request for a 14-day remand order, the maximum permitted under the law. The proceedings commenced {{before the arrival of}} his lawyers, who later alleged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> investigating <b>police</b> officers intentionally refrained from informing them about <b>the</b> proceedings, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> court <b>police</b> had also misled the investigating officers about Tan's lawyers' whereabouts.|$|R
25|$|In August 2016, the CNDH {{concluded}} {{their investigation}} {{and stated that}} at least 22 of the 42 were killed extrajudicially. They said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Federal <b>Police</b> killed 22 men, most of them from Ocotlán, Jalisco, and then moved their bodies to the scene in order to fake their deaths there. <b>The</b> CNDH believes <b>that</b> this attack was a retaliation from <b>the</b> Federal <b>Police.</b> They suspected <b>that</b> <b>the</b> men were involved in organized crime since Ocotlán was traditionally a base and recruitment hub of the CJNG. <b>The</b> Federal <b>Police,</b> however, denies these findings and stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police's</b> response was proportionate to the aggression they received from the gunmen killed at the shootout.|$|R
5|$|On November 13, 2012, the {{spokesperson}} of the Prague State Attorney's Office announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> had formally {{closed their}} investigation and proposed to the State Attorney to indict Blythe. After reviewing the case file, the State Attorney indicted Blythe on the aforementioned charges on November 30, 2012. Two weeks later, a judge set the trial to commence on February 4, 2013, {{with a plan}} to conduct the hearings in four consecutive days. Blythe was summoned to attend the hearing in person.|$|E
5|$|Sheriff Porttens {{was outraged}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> fled and rounded up the {{officers}} who were missing and ordered them to protect the streetcars, but thirty-three resigned rather than follow the order. Mayor Shank supported the police mutiny and their refusal to protect the streetcars. He insisted that the situation required Governor Ralston to take action. Without police protection, the Traction and Terminal Company shut down operations and refused to restart them until adequate protection could be provided.|$|E
5|$|The September 2008 attacks had {{political}} significance, {{given that}} the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Karnataka state government, led by B. S. Yeddyurappa, were also accused of involvement and backing the anti-Christian campaigns and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> {{were reported to have}} had knowledge of the imminent attacks but failed to prevent them. The police were criticised for their reaction to the protests and a report by a committee of human rights activists set up in the aftermath to examine the causes of the attacks claimed that they had used the event as a pretext to assault the community, rather than defend it. Justice B. K. Somasekhara of Karnataka, however, concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> and government helped maintain order and were not responsible for the attacks. In response to the alleged forcible conversions of involvement, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) gave a three-month deadline for New Life Fellowship Trust (NLFT) to stop all conversion activities in Mangalore. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Mangalore declared that it would distance itself from the New Life Fellowship Trust.|$|E

5|$|The {{role of the}} Appropriate Adult is not {{to provide}} legal advice to the police detainee/suspect/witness. Their role is {{to act as a}} bridge between the Investigation Officer and the police detainee/suspect/witness to enable him/her to {{communicate}} more effectively during the police interview. This means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> detainee/suspect/witness does not misunderstand the questions asked or that he/she is not misunderstood by the Investigation Officer, ensuring that statements recorded are reliable.|$|E
5|$|Vladislav : The Times stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> have {{identified}} the man they believe may have poisoned Litvinenko with a fatal polonium dose in {{a cup of tea}} on the fourth-floor room at the Millennium Hotel to discuss a business deal with Dmitry Kovtun and Andrey Lugovoy before going to the bar. These three men were joined in the room later by the mystery figure who was introduced as Vladislav, a man who could help Litvinenko win a lucrative contract with a Moscow-based private security firm.|$|E
5|$|Zlín region {{politicians}} {{announced they}} would call {{for the establishment of}} a local tactical team. Meanwhile, the Minister of Interior commented <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> were already in the process of hiring 4,000 new officers (about 10% of its total manpower), thus reversing cuts enacted by previous governments. Experts further pointed out the necessity to provide more CQB training to policemen in small municipalities and at rural areas. This type of training had until that point been largely aimed and directed at police officers in large towns.|$|E

5|$|After ten days' investigation, Oxley was {{surprised}} to learn that the Gibraltar Police were handling the police investigation into the shootings, having been closely involved in the events leading up to them. He also grew concerned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> investigation was insufficiently rigorous when he learned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> had not taken statements from residents whose flats overlooked the scene of Farrell's and McCann's deaths. The Gibraltar coroner, Felix Pizzarello, welcomed This Weeks investigation, telling Oxley that he hoped the journalists would uncover witnesses who could assist the inquest. While Oxley was investigating the shootings from Gibraltar, Manyon travelled to Madrid in an attempt {{to learn more about the}} surveillance operation which took place in Spain prior to the shootings. Bolton added Alison Cahn to the team on 18 March; her task was to visit the flats which overlooked the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot, with the aim of interviewing any residents who might have witnessed the events of 6 March. After several days' work, the team found two eyewitnesses to the shootings who were willing to speak on camera: Stephen Bullock, a local lawyer who had witnessed the events while out for a walk with his wife; and Josie Celecia, a housewife who had seen the shooting of McCann and Savage from her apartment window. Both witnesses' statements appeared to the journalists to be inconsistent with the official account of the shootings.|$|E
5|$|After the trial, Manoj and Babli, {{accompanied}} {{by a team of}} five police officers assigned to them for protection, left for Chandigarh. The police left them at Pipli and slipped away. Suspecting foul play, Manoj and Babli did not continue toward Chandigarh, instead boarding a bus for Karnal. According to a statement filed by Chanderpati, later that day, around 3:40pm, she received a call from a Pipli telephone booth from Manoj, who said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> had deserted them, and Babli's family members were trailing them, so they would try to take a bus to Delhi and call her back later. Babli asked for acceptance from Chanderpati, who replied affirmatively. That was the last time Manoj's family heard from the couple.|$|E
5|$|Both {{parents were}} monarchists and liberal conservatives, being {{committed}} to the emancipation reform of 1861 introduced by the reformist Tsar Alexander II; they avoided political radicals {{and there is no}} evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> ever put them under surveillance for subversive thought. Every summer they holidayed at a rural manor in Kokushkino. Among his siblings, Lenin was closest to his sister Olga, whom he often bossed around; he had an extremely competitive nature and could be destructive, but usually admitted his misbehaviour.
