5|$|The divine power seems {{originally}} to {{have designed}} Demosthenes and Cicero upon the same plan, giving them many similarities {{in their natural}} characters, as their passion for distinction and <b>their</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> liberty in civil life, and their want of courage in dangers and war, {{and at the same}} time also to have added many accidental resemblances. I think there can hardly be found two other orators, who, from small and obscure beginnings, became so great and mighty; who both contested with kings and tyrants; both lost their daughters, were driven out of their country, and returned with honor; who, flying from thence again, were both seized upon by their enemies, and at last ended their lives with the liberty of their countrymen.|$|E
