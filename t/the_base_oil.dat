30|$|To reduce harmful sulfur {{content in}} {{lubricant}} additives, {{making use of}} isosterism {{has been shown to}} be an effective strategy. When thiobenzothiazole compounds were used as templates, the exchange of sulfur atoms in the thiazole ring with oxygen atoms and NH groups produced twelve isosteres. Similarly, 2 -benzothiazole- S-carboxylic acid esters were used as template molecules to produce six isosteres. About 30 % of the isosteres exhibited a satisfactory deviation of ± 5 % relative to the template, ignoring the specific changes in <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>oils,</b> <b>the</b> differences in molecular structure, and the friction or wear properties. The template molecules and isosteres in triisodecyl trimellitate exhibited better tribological properties than in trimethylolpropane trioleate or bis(2 - ethylhexyl) adipate. Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA)- and comparative molecular similarity index analysis (CoMSIA)-quantitative structure tribo-ability relationship (QSTR) models were employed to study the correlation of molecular structures between <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>oils</b> and additives. <b>The</b> models indicate that the higher the structural similarities of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>oils</b> and additives are, the more synergetic the molecular force fields of the lubricating system are; the molecular force fields creating synergistic effects will improve tribological performance.|$|R

50|$|Grease is a semisolid lubricant. Grease {{generally}} {{consists of}} a soap emulsified with mineral or vegetable oil. The characteristic feature of greases is that they possess a high initial viscosity, which upon the application of shear, drops to give the effect of an oil-lubricated bearing of approximately the same viscosity as <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> used in the grease. This change in viscosity is called shear thinning. Grease is sometimes used to describe lubricating materials that are simply soft solids or high viscosity liquids, but these materials do not exhibit the shear-thinning properties characteristic of the classical grease. For example, petroleum jellies such as Vaseline are not generally classified as greases.|$|E

50|$|Improvement in {{filtration}} {{technologies and}} processes has now made recycling {{a viable option}} (with rising price of base stock and crude oil). Typically various filtration systems remove particulates, additives and oxidation products and recover <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>oil.</b> The oil may get refined during the process. This base oil is then treated {{much the same as}} virgin base oil however there is considerable reluctance to use recycled oils as they are generally considered inferior. Basestock fractionally vacuum distilled from used lubricants has superior properties to all natural oils, but cost effectiveness depends on many factors. Used lubricant may also be used as refinery feedstock to become part of crude oil. Again, there is considerable reluctance to this use as the additives, soot and wear metals will seriously poison/deactivate the critical catalysts in the process. Cost prohibits carrying out both filtration (soot, additives removal) and re-refining (distilling, isomerisation, hydrocrack, etc.) however the primary hindrance to recycling still remains the collection of fluids as refineries need continuous supply in amounts measured in cisterns, rail tanks.|$|E
5000|$|Some truffle oils {{are made}} with truffle {{residues}} incurred during collection or preparation for sale. Many truffle oils sold in retail markets are not made from truffles, but instead use manufactured aromatic compounds including 2,4-dithiapentane (a prominent aroma active compound found in truffles) with an oil base. There are no regulations regarding the labeling of 2,4-dithiapentane, and it can legally be called truffle aroma, truffle flavor, truffle concentrate or other similar terms {{even though it is}} not extracted from truffles. In the United States, the ingredient may use the modifiers [...] "organic" [...] or [...] "natural" [...] as long as the components meet the federal requirements for those terms. Truffle oils range from clear to cloudy, and yellow to green, depending on <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> used. Some include a piece of truffle in the bottle. These pieces can be from any of over 200 different truffle species, and may be listed as [...] "black truffle" [...] or [...] "white truffle" [...] even if not one of prized culinary varietals such as the black Périgord or white Alba truffle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{temperature}} range {{the oil is}} exposed to in most vehicles can be wide, ranging from cold temperatures in the winter before the vehicle is started up, to hot operating temperatures when the vehicle is fully warmed up in hot summer weather. A specific oil will have high viscosity when cold and a lower viscosity at the engine's operating temperature. The difference in viscosities for most single-grade oil is too large between the extremes of temperature. To bring the difference in viscosities closer together, special polymer additives called viscosity index improvers, or VIIs {{are added to the}} oil. These additives are used to make the oil a multi-grade motor oil, though it is possible to have a multi-grade oil without the use of VIIs. The idea is to cause the multi-grade oil to have the viscosity of the base grade when cold and the viscosity of the second grade when hot. This enables one type of oil to be used all year. In fact, when multi-grades were initially developed, they were frequently described as all-season oil. The viscosity of a multi-grade oil still varies logarithmically with temperature, but the slope representing the change is lessened. [...] This slope representing the change with temperature depends on the nature and amount of the additives to <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Base oils {{are used}} to {{manufacture}} products including lubricating greases, motor oil and metal processing fluids. Different products require different compositions and properties in the oil. One {{of the most important}} factors is the liquid’s viscosity at various temperatures. Whether or not a crude oil is suitable to be made into a base oil is determined by the concentration of base oil molecules as well as how easily these can be extracted. [...] Base oil is produced by means of refining crude oil. This means that the crude oil is heated in order that various distillates can be separated from one another. During the heating process, light and heavy hydrocarbons are separated - the light ones can be refined to make petrol and other fuels, while the heavier ones are suitable for bitumen and base oils. There are large numbers of crude oils all around the world that {{are used to}} produce base oils. The most common one is a type of paraffinic crude oil, although there are also naphthenic crude oils that create products with better solubility and very good properties at low temperatures. By using hydrogenation technology, in which sulfur and aromatics are removed using hydrogen under high pressure, you can obtain extremely pure base oils, which are suitable when quality requirements are particularly stringent. Chemical substances - additives - are added to <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> {{in order to meet the}} quality requirements for the end products in terms of, for example, friction and cleaning properties. Certain types of motor oils contain more than twenty percent additives.|$|E

40|$|Two novel {{low-temperature}} {{ionic liquid}} processes are {{developed for the}} recovery of base oils from waste lubricant oils. One uses 3 -(triethoxysilyl) -propylammonium- 3 -(triethoxysilyl) -propyl carbamate (TESAC), in which the waste lubricant base oil is insoluble, and the other uses trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium chloride (P 6, 6, 6, 14 Cl) in which <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> is soluble. In the 3 -aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (TESA) /TESAC process, waste oil components, including <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>oil,</b> are dissolved in the solvent TESA which is converted, in situ, with carbon dioxide to TESAC, recovering <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> as an insoluble layer.

40|$|An {{experiment}} using a purpose-built {{test rig}} {{to examine the}} effect of oil chemistry on the charging ability of various oils revealed that the charge produced depends on two extrinsic properties; the electric field (used to charge the droplet) and the droplet radius. A normalization parameter was developed from these dependencies and used to compare the results from the tests described herein. Four classes of liquids were tested. These were pure hydrocarbon liquids (hexadecane, decane, and squalane), <b>base</b> <b>oils</b> (both mineral and synthetic stocks), formulated <b>oils</b> (mineral <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> with additives), and commercial oils (fully formulated mineral and synthetic oils, available over-the-counter). The charging for both pure hydrocarbons and <b>base</b> <b>oils</b> indicates that <b>the</b> charged species have a low mobility and thus are likely to be large, bulky molecules. For this reason, the charging of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>oils</b> is noticeably time dependent and the charge imparted on the oil did not always reach saturation. The charging (rate) of <b>base</b> <b>oils</b> appears to follow the level of impurities (particularly sulfur). Generally, both pure hydrocarbons and <b>base</b> <b>oils</b> tend to charge more when a positive field is applied. Conductivity values help to explain the measured charge levels. This would be expected as conductivity is related to the ionic species (charge carriers) present. The majority of the formulated and commercial oils tested reached charge saturation for all conditions tested, resulting in a normalized value of around 0. 1 pC mm? 1 V? 1, comparable with a theoretical calculated value.

40|$|Nano oils {{synthesized}} by dispersing dielectric nanostructures counter common intuition as such nano oils possess {{substantially higher}} positive {{dielectric breakdown voltage}} with reduced streamer velocities than <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>oils.</b> Nano oils comprising stable and dilute homogeneous dispersions of two forms of titanium (IV) oxide (TiO 2) nanoparticles (Anatase and Rutile) have been experimentally examined and observed to exhibit highly enhanced dielectric breakdown strength compared to conventional transformer oils. Indepth survey of literature yields that research on enhancing insulation properties of mineral oils by utilizing anatase and rutile titania nanoparticles is nought. The present study involves titania dispersed in two different grades of transformer oils, both with varied levels of thermal treatment, to obtain consistent and high degrees of enhancement in the breakdown strength, as well as high degrees of increment in {{the survival of the}} oils at elevated electrical stressing compared to <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>oils,</b> as obtained via detailed twin parameter Weibull distribution analysis of the experimental observations. It is also observed that heat treatment of the nano oils further enhances the dielectric breakdown performance. Additionally, further enhancements are observed at elevated operational temperatures. Detailed studies on the performance of the nano oils in presence of variant quantities of moisture have also been put forward. The grossly different charging dynamics of dielectric nanoparticles localized within the oil has been proposed to be responsible for efficient electron trapping, leading to decrease in the positive streamer velocity and resulting in high dielectric breakdown voltage. The differences in the performance of anatase and rutile has been explained <b>based</b> on <b>the</b> electronic structure of the two and the affinity towards electron scavenging.

40|$|Abstract. High {{temperature}} tribological {{behavior of}} nano-Al 2 O 3 in different base oils were tested by a SRV multifunctional test system.
