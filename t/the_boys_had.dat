5|$|Bamber {{visited the}} farm {{on the evening}} of Tuesday, 6 August. He told the court that his parents {{suggested}} to Sheila that evening that the boys be placed in day-time foster care with a local family. Bamber said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had simply said she would rather stay in London. <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, and it had not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Ferguson, told the Court of Appeal in 2002 that any suggestion that the children be removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, but that she might have welcomed daytime help.|$|E
5|$|When {{his brother}} King Edward IV died in April 1483, Richard was named Lord Protector {{of the realm}} for Edward's eldest son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. Arrangements were made for Edward's {{coronation}} on 22 June 1483; but, before the young king could be crowned, the marriage of his parents was declared bigamous and therefore invalid, making their children officially illegitimate and thus barring them from inheriting the throne. On 25 June, an assembly of Lords and commoners endorsed a declaration to this effect and proclaimed Richard the rightful king. The following day, Richard III began his reign, and he was crowned on 6 July 1483. The young princes, Edward {{and his younger brother}} Richard, Duke of York, were not seen in public after August, and accusations circulated that <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> been murdered on Richard's orders.|$|E
25|$|At {{least two}} of <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> {{distinguished}} careers. Alexander Cooke {{is associated with a}} number of Shakespeare's female characters, while Christopher Beeston {{went on to become a}} wealthy impresario in the seventeenth century.|$|E

25|$|On {{the second}} day of the committal {{proceedings}} Terence gave another three hours of testimony about their mistreatment. The following day he was recalled again and admitted that <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> sometimes misbehaved and deserved to be punished. Gough had played cricket and football with them and the Goughs insisted the boys said their prayers every night. This time he said that they all ate the same food.|$|E
25|$|Six months later, Brusilovsky {{returned}} to Kiev, {{which had been}} liberated from Germany. In an attempt to earn some money, he joined a group of boys who shined shoes on the square {{in front of the}} train station. Every evening, a grown-up lad with the nickname Kot (Tomcat) would come to the square. He was connected with the local criminal class, and he would take most of the money <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> earned. If they tried to hide what they had earned, the boys were dealt with harshly.|$|E
25|$|At 7:15p.m. on September12, 1952, two brothers, Edward and Fred May, {{and their}} friend Tommy Hyer (ages 13, 12, and 10 respectively) {{witnessed}} a bright object cross the sky, {{coming to rest}} on land belonging to local farmer G. Bailey Fisher. Upon witnessing the object, the boys went {{to the home of}} the May brothers' mother, Kathleen May, where they told the story of having seen a UFO crash land in the hills. From there, Mrs. May, accompanied by the three boys, local children Neil Nunley (14) and Ronnie Shaver (10), and 17-year-old West Virginia National Guardsman Eugene Lemon, traveled to the Fisher farm in an effort to locate whatever it was that <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> seen.|$|E

25|$|Piaget {{administered}} a test in 15 boys with ages ranging from 10 to 14 {{years in which}} he asked participants to describe {{the relationship between a}} mixed bouquet of flowers and a bouquet with flowers of the same color. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the thinking process <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> and to draw conclusions about the logic processes they had used, which was a psychometric technique of research. Piaget also used the psychoanalytic method initially developed by Sigmund Freud. The purpose of using such method was to examine the unconscious mind, as well as to continue parallel studies using different research methods. Psychoanalysis was later rejected by Piaget, as he thought it was insufficiently empirical (Mayer, 2005).|$|E
25|$|Many honors were heaped {{upon him}} by {{citizens}} {{and city officials}} of the Empire, including Colonia Obsequens Iulia Pisana (Pisa), where it was decreed that proper rites must be observed by matrons to lament his passing. Temples, public baths, and shops shut their doors as women wept inconsolably. To commemorate his brief life, a cenotaph was erected on the Limyrus River in Lycia. Posthumously, the Senate voted honors for the young Caesars, and arranged for the golden spears and shields <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> received on achieving the age of military service, to be hung in the Senate House. The caskets containing their ashes were stored in the Mausoleum of Augustus alongside those of their father Agrippa {{and other members of}} the imperial family.|$|E
25|$|A {{long time}} ago some young lads herded sheep on Hesselberg. At that {{time there was a}} deep cave on the mountain, which is buried today. Bursting with curiosity they wanted to know what was inside. One of them was lowered by rope down into the deep hole. Beforehand <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> decided to pull him up {{immediately}} when he gave a tug on the rope. Soon after the boy went into the cave, a three-legged rabbit hobbled across the way, the other lads followed it spontaneously in order to catch it, but the farther they chased the faster the rabbit ran. Finally they gave up. When they returned to the cave they remembered their fellow in the hole and they immediately pulled the rope up. It was stained with blood and at its end there hung a goat's hoof, but the boy was gone forever.|$|E

50|$|Several months later, {{the body}} was recovered. The baron was tried for Skelton's murder, but had an alibi. An old farm worker stated that the baron <b>had</b> ordered <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> to remove a tool from the top shelf in the barn, and <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> fallen, seriously {{wounding}} himself in the process. The baron had tended to the wounds, but <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> died. It is on record that Robert Hylton, 13th Baron Hylton was pardoned in 1609.|$|R
25|$|The society {{provided}} school examinations such as arithmetic, geography, history, grammar, drawing, Latin, French, algebra and bookkeeping. In early 1885, Henry Valentine Goold {{presented the}} prizes at St John's College, Grimsargh, Preston, Lancashire, where <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> taken the Society's exams and the principal, Reverend T. Abbott Peters, M.A., was a Fellow of the Society. In 1886 at the Convent of Jesus and Mary, Ipswich, all eighteen pupils who took examinations passed with honour certificates or honours in individual subjects, such as French, music, botany, bookkeeping, English, German and drawing. In 1887, nineteen {{out of the}} twenty candidates at St. Joseph's College, Weston Hall, Rugby passed the exam and received the Society's certificate. In the same year at the Ursuline Convent, Upton, Essex, most pupils took the Society's exams. Many candidates obtained maximum marks, some earned Honours, and one candidate Miss Winifred Wilson received a silver medallion. In 1890 at St Rose's Convent School, Stroud, its female pupils {{took part in a}} competition and exhibition of work which was posted to the Society's Kensington base. Two girls obtained certificates with honours for their oil paintings: E. Hanman and Nellie Mackey. Mary Culler won the same for her map drawing. The pupils took the Society's exams in nine subjects, including scripture, grammar, freehand and model drawing, French, theory of music, history and literature, with Hanman and Mackey winning Honours while Gertie McKay aged 12 received a certificate too. In 1891, the Society was cited as the exam board for Euston College, England, in its prospectus.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{their school}} years the {{brothers}} {{were sent to}} stay during the holidays with various uncles and aunts {{from both sides of}} the family. In the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Iain Sproat counts twenty aunts and considers that they played an important part not only in Wodehouse's early life, but, thinly disguised, in his mature novels, as the formidable aunts who dominate the action in the Wooster, Blandings, and other stories. <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> fifteen uncles, four of whom were clergymen. Sproat writes that they inspired Wodehouse's [...] "pious but fallible curates, vicars, and bishops, of which he wrote with friendly irreverence but without mockery".|$|E
500|$|The intense {{collaboration}} between Dylan and The Hawks {{that produced the}} basement recordings {{came to an end}} in October 1967 when Dylan relocated to Nashville to record a formal studio album, John Wesley Harding, with a different crew of accompanying musicians. The same month, drummer Levon Helm rejoined his former bandmates in Woodstock, after he {{received a phone call from}} Danko informing him that they were getting ready to record as a group. In his autobiography, Helm recalled how he listened to the recordings The Hawks had made with Dylan, and remembered that he [...] "could tell that hanging out with <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> helped Bob to find a connection with things we were interested in: blues, rockabilly, R They had rubbed off on him a little." ...|$|E

500|$|Because {{the press}} barely covered the story, the affair would have faded quickly from public memory {{if not for}} {{journalist}} Ernest Parke. The editor of the obscure politically radical weekly The North London Press, Parke got wind of the affair {{when one of his}} reporters brought him the story of Newlove's conviction. Parke began to question why the prostitutes had been given such light sentences relative to their offence (the usual penalty for [...] "gross indecency" [...] was two years) and how Hammond had been able to evade arrest. His curiosity aroused, Parke found out that <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> named prominent aristocrats. He subsequently ran a story on 28 September hinting at their involvement but without detailing specific names. It was only on 16 November that he published a follow up story specifically naming Henry Fitzroy, Earl of Euston, in [...] "an indescribably loathsome scandal in Cleveland Street". He further alleged that Euston may have gone to Peru and that he had been allowed to escape to cover up the involvement of a more highly placed person, who was not named but was believed by some to be Prince Albert Victor, the son of the Prince of Wales.|$|E
500|$|Will & Grace creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan based {{the show}} on their own lives. Mutchnick, who is openly gay, based the {{relationship}} between Will and Grace on his real-life relationship with a woman named Janet. Originally, Mutchnick and Kohan first went to the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), who told them to create a television series about a new young love story, as Mad About You was going off the air. The character of Will {{was part of a}} sitcom Mutchnick and Kohan first pitched to NBC executives in 1997. The original concept was an ensemble comedy featuring three couples, one of which was a gay man living with a straight woman. Warren Littlefield, the executive vice president of NBC at the time, was not excited about the first two couples, but wanted {{to learn more about the}} gay and straight couple, so Mutchnick and Kohan was sent to create a pilot script centering on those two characters. NBC went to sitcom director James Burrows to see what he thought of the homosexual subject matter and if an audience would be interested in the show. Burrows liked the idea and when he first read the script in November 1997, he decided that he wanted to direct it. Burrows said, [...] "I knew that <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> captured a genre and a group of characters I have never read before." [...] The filming of the pilot began in March 1998. The actors who played Will and Grace, Eric McCormack and Debra Messing, were positive about the series and they thought it had the potential to last on television. McCormack said, [...] "When shooting was finished that night, Debra and I were sitting on the couch and looking at each other and I said, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre gonna be on this set for a while.‚Äô And we sort of clasped hands, but we didn‚Äôt want to say anything beyond that and jinx it." ...|$|E

[...] They have emphasized instead that the executions are a violation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Iran is a signatory to both), which prohibit the execution of minors.|$|E
