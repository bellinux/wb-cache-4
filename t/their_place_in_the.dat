5|$|Having {{previously}} {{played football}} for Mitchell Main {{in the winter}} of 1912–13, Kilner played as a right-back for Preston North End F.C. while posted to Preston during the war. The team won promotion from the Second Division in 1915, and took <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> First Division when league football resumed in 1919. Sometimes playing under the name of Smith to avoid detection (although it is not certain why he did so), Kilner's first certain appearance for the team was in September 1918. It is unclear how often he represented the club.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool faced Stoke City in the Sixth Round at Anfield. Suárez {{scored in}} the 23rd minute to give Liverpool the lead, before former player Peter Crouch {{equalised}} three minutes later. Downing {{scored in the}} second half to secure a 2–1 for the club and ensure <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> semi-finals. Local rivals Everton were the opponents in the semi-final, held at Wembley Stadium. Nikica Jelavić scored in the 24th minute after a Liverpool defensive error, to give Everton a 1–0 lead. Liverpool equalised {{in the second half}} when Suárez scored after a back-pass from Everton defender Sylvain Distin. The match looked to be heading towards extra time, before Carroll headed in a Craig Bellamy free kick in the 87th minute to give Liverpool a 2–1 victory and secure <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final {{for the first time since}} 2006, when they defeated West Ham United.|$|E

5|$|Their {{opponents in}} the second round were Belgian team Standard Liège.

Liverpool won the first leg in England 3–1 and a 2–1 victory at Liège's home ground Stade Maurice Dufrasne ensured a 5–2 aggregate victory.|$|E
5|$|A One Day International (ODI) is an {{international}} cricket match between two teams, each having ODI status, {{as determined by the}} International Cricket Council. The women's variant of the game is similar to the men's version, with minor modifications to umpiring and pitch requirements. The first women's ODI was played in 1973, between England and Australia. Due to the sporting boycott placed upon their country, South Africa women did not contest their first ODI until August 1997, playing Ireland in Belfast. Later that year, South Africa entered the Women's Cricket World Cup for the first time, and were eliminated in the quarter-finals. They went one better in 2000, reaching the semi-finals, but since then have finished seventh twice (2005 and 2009) and sixth (2013), before reaching the semi-finals once more in 2017. They were required to compete in a qualifying series to confirm <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2009 (World Cup 2009 qualifier) and 2013 (World Cup 2013 qualifier) tournaments.|$|E

He then {{played in the}} Stockholm Open, losing {{in the second round}} to James Blake. He then reached the final in Vienna, losing {{for the first time to}} Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Despite having won the first set, he eventually lost the final. Del Potro then reached the semifinals of the Valencia Open 500, losing to eventual champion Marcel Granollers. He then withdrew from the Paris Masters due to a shoulder injury, wiping out his chances of qualifying for the Year-End Championships.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of their victory, Plymouth Argyle {{returned}} to the third tier of English football just one year after being relegated to the fourth tier {{for the first time in}} its history. They returned to the Third Division two years later before being promoted as champions in 2002, and the club followed that up by winning the Second Division in 2004, to reclaim <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second tier of English football after a twelve-year hiatus. For Darlington, there was to be more disappointment in the play-offs four years later under David Hodgson, Platt's successor. They reached the Third Division final in 2000, the last to be played at the original Wembley Stadium, and were defeated 10 again; on this occasion to Peterborough United.|$|E
5|$|At the Stadio delle Alpi, Filippo Inzaghi scored {{twice in}} the first 11 minutes to give Juve a 3–1 {{aggregate}} lead. Team captain Roy Keane, however, who was shown a yellow card preventing him from playing the final, headed in a Beckham cross. Dwight Yorke added a second to level the match just before the break. In the second half, Cole put United ahead {{for the first time}} in the match and the tie. Yorke was brought down by the Juve keeper in the area as he went round him, but the referee played the advantage and Cole tapped in from an acute angle. United held on for their first victory in Italy and booked <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Camp Nou for the final, against group opponents Bayern Munich.|$|E

5|$|Berge and Brundtland were {{introduced}} to each other through a mutual friend in Tromsø, Norway. They enjoyed the same films and music, and shared an interest in electronics. The two experimented with various forms of electronic music, and bought a drum machine together during the Tromsø techno scene before going their separate ways. Several years later, the two met up again and formed Röyksopp during the Bergen Wave. After experimenting with different genres of electronic music, the band solidified <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> electronica scene with their 2001 debut album, Melody A.M., released on the Wall of Sound record label.|$|E
5|$|China {{won their}} fifth {{gold medal in}} the women's event and the first since 2004 after winning the silver medal in the last three Olympiads. They scored 20 match points with nine wins and two draws, {{finishing}} three points ahead of Poland and Ukraine who scored 17 match points each. Poland won the silver medal after winning the tie-breaker with Ukraine. The defending champions from the previous three Olympiads Russia finished without a medal on the fourth place after losing the decisive match for the gold medal against China in the final round. Vietnam, Azerbaijan and Israel have all surprised positively, finishing on the seventh, eighth and the ninth place, respectively. The teams that disappointed with <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final standings include Georgia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Germany, Spain and Turkey.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their poor}} {{qualifying}} campaign, Argentina were considered title contenders at the World Cup in South Africa. At {{the start of}} the tournament, the new formation proved effective; Messi managed at least four attempts on goal during their opening match but was repeatedly denied by Nigeria's goalkeeper, resulting in a 1–0 win. During the next match, against South Korea, he excelled in his playmaking role, participating in all four goals of his side's 4–1 victory. As <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> knockout phase was guaranteed, most of the starters were rested during the last group match, but Messi reportedly refused to be benched. He wore the captain's armband {{for the first time in}} their 2–0 win against Greece; as the focal point of their play, he helped create their second goal to see Argentina finish as group winners. In the round of 16, they defeated Mexico 3–1, with Messi assisting their first goal, a controversial strike that stood despite being offside.|$|E

5|$|Despite their success, Liverpool {{were not}} celebrating {{immediately}} after the match, as they had an important match in the Premier League on the Saturday following the final. The match against Charlton Athletic was a must-win match for Liverpool {{if they wanted to}} finish in third place in the league and claim the final UEFA Champions League qualification place. The subsequent match was won 4–0 by Liverpool to secure <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2001–02 UEFA Champions League. Winning the UEFA Cup entitled Liverpool to compete in the 2001 UEFA Super Cup against Champions League winners Bayern Munich. Liverpool won the match 3–2 to secure their second Super Cup victory.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} two seasons Liverpool {{consolidated}} <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> First Division, with fifth and ninth-place finishes. Performances improved in the 1898–99 season, when the club went into their final game with a chance of winning their first League championship. They faced Aston Villa, with whom they were level on points, although Villa's goal average advantage of 0.02 meant that they only needed to draw the match to win the League title. In the event, Villa won 5–0, to leave Liverpool as the runners-up. Liverpool also reached the FA Cup semi-final, where they faced Sheffield United. The match finished in a 2–2 draw; the first replay at Burnden Park also finished with the sides equal at 4–4, and a second replay at the small Fallowfield Stadium was abandoned when overcrowding caused fans to spill onto the pitch. The tie was finally decided at the Baseball Ground, which Sheffield United won 1–0.|$|E
5|$|For the Fourth Round, Liverpool {{were drawn}} {{at their home}} ground, Anfield against Manchester United.

With the match approaching full-time, Dirk Kuyt scored in the 88th minute to give Liverpool a 2–1 victory and secured <b>their</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Fifth Round.
