5|$|Johnson was {{initially}} left {{to devise a}} Reconstruction policy without legislative intervention, as Congress was not due to meet again until December 1865. Radical Republicans told <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>that</b> the Southern states were economically {{in a state of}} chaos and urged him to use his leverage to insist on rights for freedmen as a condition of restoration to the Union. But Johnson, with the support of other officials including Seward, insisted that the franchise was a state, not a federal matter. The Cabinet was divided on the issue.|$|E
5|$|President Andrew Johnson {{appointed}} Ewing as U.S. Minister to Holland, {{where he}} served from 1866 to 1870. This appointment may have drawn the ire of the Radical Republicans, for Speaker of the House James G. Blaine urged President Ulysses S. Grant that Ewing be recalled and replaced with his brother, Charles Ewing. Blaine told <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>that</b> Hugh was 'acting badly'. Blaine himself was disingenuous, having represented to prominent politicians in Ohio including Senator John Sherman {{that he was doing}} everything possible to nominate his close personal friend, former Ohio General Roeliff Brinkerhoff, for the post. Nonetheless, Blaine's request to recall General Ewing was never acted upon, possibly due to the influence of his sister, whose husband General Sherman was a very close friend to President Grant.|$|E

Phu informed <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>that</b> the only route possible for the redeployment, given PAVN blocking actions, was little-used Interprovincial Route 7B, a neglected, narrow, rough-surfaced track (actually a logging road) with several downed bridges along its course.|$|E

He decides to blow the whistle on the company to Harkin, but as he refuses to appear on camera, Harkin's boss will not allow the piece to air.|$|E

After meeting Diana Prince, with whom he teamed to defeat Hades and Felix Faust, Clark, as Superman, chose to reveal to <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>that</b> he was not a meteor-infected individual as the public believed but was from another planet.

5|$|On March 13, amidst heavy {{fighting}} in the northern provinces of South Vietnam, General Ngô Quang Trưởng flew out to Saigon {{for a meeting with}} President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. In this meeting, President Thiệu outlined his decision to abandon most of the provinces in I Corps Tactical Zone, and ordered General Trưởng to withdraw his forces towards the coastal regions of central Vietnam instead. In addition, the Airborne Division (South Vietnam) would be redeployed to the Mekong Delta region, where it could protect the nation's capital. Unwilling to concede the northern provinces to the enemy, General Trưởng tried unsuccessfully to convince President Thiệu to reverse his decision in the belief that he could hold onto I Corps, and recapture lost territories by using the Airborne and Marine Corps Divisions. After he returned to his headquarters that afternoon, General Trưởng decided to redeploy his forces instead of carrying out President Thiệu's order straightaway, for several reasons. Firstly, he wanted to convince <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>that</b> most South Vietnamese units were still intact, and that they still had the time to recapture lost territories. And secondly, General Trưởng did not want to create confusion amongst his subordinates, when the military situation in I Corps was still under control.|$|E

The film went on to become a classic, and Boyd was determined not to make the same mistake twice when the producers inquired about filming at Oregon. After consulting with student government leaders and officers of the Pan Hellenic Council, the Director of University Relations advised <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>that</b> the script, although raunchy and often tasteless, was a very funny spoof of college life. Boyd even allowed the filmmakers to use his office as Dean Wormer's.|$|E
