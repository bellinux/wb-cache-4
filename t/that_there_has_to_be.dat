500|$|The episode's {{antagonistic}} bug {{creature was}} created {{by means of a}} prosthetic suit that was worn by a stuntwoman. The suit was highly ridiculed behind the scenes. Actor Markinson, upon seeing the costume, said [...] "this is what's driving me crazy?" [...] Director Kim Manners was highly critical of the monster and later told people that after the episode would air, his career would be [...] "over". Gilligan attributed the problems due to the episodic work schedule, he noted, [...] "we're usually on such a short schedule <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a weak link somewhere". Gilligan also stated that the [...] "over engineered" [...] aspects of the suit made it somewhat comical. To fix the perceived issues with the monster, the production team gave the filmed footage to visual effects editor Laurie Kallsen-George, who [...] "took the footage with the monster in it, erased the monster completely, took the monster to a different screen [...] animated it, and added speed blur". The effects took a large amount of time to complete. They were only finished at 7:30 the morning the episode was scheduled to air. In the end, the monster is not clearly visible in the installment, which allowed the scariness of the episode to be more real, according to Gilligan.|$|E

He suspects there is another white cemetery that hasn't been discovered. [...] "I think that there are at least 100 more bodies up there", he said. [...] "At some point they are going to find more bodies, I'm dead certain of <b>that.</b> <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a white graveyard on the white side." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} {{limiting factor}} of wind power is variable power generated by wind farms. In most locations {{the wind blows}} {{only part of the}} time, which means <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> back-up capacity of conventional generating capacity to cover periods that the wind is not blowing. To address this issue it has been proposed to create a [...] "supergrid" [...] to connect national grids together across western Europe, ranging from Denmark across the southern North Sea to England and the Celtic Sea to Ireland, and further south to France and Spain especially in Higueruela which was considered for some time the biggest wind farm in the world. The idea is that by the time a low pressure area has moved away from Denmark to the Baltic Sea the next low appears off the coast of Ireland. Therefore, {{while it is true that}} the wind is not blowing everywhere all of the time, it will always be blowing somewhere.|$|E

2500|$|The Zapatistas’ {{movement}} {{was the first}} time a guerrilla movement held women’s liberation as part of the agenda for the uprising. Major Ana Maria—who was not only the woman who lead the EZLN capture of San Cristobal de las Casas during the uprising, but also one of the women who helped create the Women’s Revolutionary Law, [...] ‘A general law was made, but there was no women’s law. And so we protested and said <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a women’s law when we make our demands. We also want the government to recognize us as women. The right to have equality, equality of men and women.’ The Women’s Revolutionary Law came about through a woman named Susana and Comandanta Ramona traveling to dozens of communities and to ask the opinions of thousands of women. The Women’s Revolutionary Law was released {{along with the rest of}} the Zapatista demands aimed at the government during their public uprising on New Years Day of 1994.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, McCain {{announced}} that he supported the inclusion of intelligent design teaching in schools. He told the Arizona Daily Star that, [...] "I think <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> all points of view presented. But they've got to be thoroughly presented. So {{to say that you}} can only teach one line of thinking … or one belief on how people and the world was created I think there's nothing wrong with teaching different schools of thought." [...] In 2006 he seemed to back off the position a bit, saying, [...] "Should [...] be taught as a science class? Probably not." [...] McCain's 2005 book Character Is Destiny had included a highly complimentary chapter on Charles Darwin, in which McCain wrote, [...] "Darwin helped explain nature's laws. He did not speculate, in his published theories at least, on the origin of life. The only undeniable challenge the theory of evolution poses to Christian beliefs is its obvious contradiction of the idea that God created {{the world as it is}} in less than a week." ...|$|E
2500|$|The fire {{having done}} only {{moderate}} damage, Shawn and Gus leave, visiting Lassiter and O'Hara before driving {{to talk with}} Dunn's ex-girlfriend. Her alibi checks out, and Shawn gains another lead. While returning from the woman's house, Shawn and Gus's car is nearly rammed off the road, the driver fleeing after the attempt. Shawn notices several details, and comes {{up with an idea}} for who Dunn's ghost is. Returning to Robert's house, they search most of the house for him. Instead of finding him, they discover a secret room in the attic, which is filled with women's clothing and accessories. Shawn realizes that Robert is [...] "Regina Kane", and that he unknowingly suffers from multiple personality disorder. They find Robert, and trigger his [...] "Regina" [...] personality, but it turns out not to be violent. They decide <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a third personality, a violent one. Remembering what the ex-girlfriend had said, Shawn realizes afterwards that it is [...] "Martin Brody", who is likely the person who tried to take them out. Remembering that [...] "Regina" [...] scheduled a meeting with another doctor, Shawn and Gus alert the police and rush to the doctor's office, stopping [...] "Martin" [...] right before he kills the man.|$|E

2500|$|Yorke was {{initially}} unconvinced at the Jackson paedophilia storyline proposal. He [...] commented to The Guardian in 2008, [...] "My standpoint {{has always been}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a good editorial justification. If it's just entertainment, or just sensation, or just the bogeyman in this case, then I don't think that's a good enough reason." [...] However, Yorke was convinced by Santer who opined that [...] "it would be a talking point that could truly educate and inform". It was decided that Bianca's stepdaughter Whitney would be the character that Bianca's boyfriend Tony groomed for sex. According to Bianca's backstory, Tony was [...] "a Mancunian who [...] had one day given Bianca a lift home, three years before her return to Walford, and noticed, standing in the hallway, 12-year-old Whitney in her pyjamas." [...] EastEnders worked closely with NSPCC when devising the storyline. The NSPCC's statistics suggested that 11% of children under 16 experienced [...] "sexual abuse by a person known but unrelated to them, often a boyfriend or girlfriend, while only 5% have been interfered with by someone unknown or whom they had just met; 1% by a parent or carer; and fewer than 1% by a professional {{in a position of}} trust". Thus it was decided that Whitney, unrelated to Tony in any biological sense, would be his victim and that Tony deliberately targeted the Jackson family, wooing Bianca, in order to groom Whitney. This idea, according to a BBC researcher, was based on real life cases. The truth was revealed to Bianca in an episode that aired in December 2008, when Whitney confessed to her stepmother, professing to love Tony. There followed Tony's imprisonment and a court case in 2009. Palmer was widely praised by critics for her performance during the reveal episodes. The storyline prompted an increase in calls to the children's help-line, ChildLine. A ChildLine director, Julie Crossan, said, [...] "Child sex abuse storylines on programmes such as EastEnders also encourage children to speak out. As a result, more children now understand what sexual abuse is and are increasingly willing to turn to ChildLine for help." ...|$|E
