5|$|A {{supporter}} of President Nixon's law-and-order philosophies, Nunn called out the National Guard <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> violent protests in the state. In May 1968, {{he sent the}} Guard to Louisville <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> race-related protests that followed peaceful civil rights marches. This action was criticized by civil rights leaders across the state. In May 1970, Nunn again dispatched the Guard to quell protests against the Vietnam War at the University of Kentucky, and imposed a curfew that interfered with final examinations. The latter protest culminated in the burning {{of one of the}} university's ROTC buildings.|$|E
5|$|The VOC {{authorities}} salvaged as much {{as possible}} from the beached Meermin. They recovered nearly 300 firearms, gunpowder and musket balls, compasses and five bayonets; they auctioned cables, ropes and other items from the ship on the shore. Meermin was left <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> where she grounded.|$|E
5|$|The book {{introduced}} {{the concepts of}} disruptive coloration <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> an object's outlines, of masquerade, as when a butterfly mimics a leaf, and especially of countershading, where an animal's tones make it appear flat by concealing its self-shadowing.|$|E

5|$|The rush: If {{the prey}} {{attempts}} to flee, the wolves immediately pursue it. This {{is the most}} critical stage of the hunt, as wolves may never catch up with prey running at top speed. If their prey is travelling in a group, the wolves either attempt <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> the herd, or isolate one or two animals from it.|$|E
5|$|Vortex {{streets are}} zigzagging {{patterns}} of whirling vortices {{created by the}} unsteady separation of flow of a fluid, most often air or water, over obstructing objects. Smooth (laminar) flow starts <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> when {{the size of the}} obstruction or the velocity of the flow become large enough compared to the viscosity of the fluid.|$|E
5|$|Although {{observations}} using {{adaptive optics}} in late 1997 and early 1998 showed a double {{peak in the}} brightness of the nucleus, controversy still exists over whether such observations can only be explained by a binary nucleus. The discovery of the satellite was not confirmed by other observations. Also, while comets have been observed <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> before, no case has previously been found of a stable binary nucleus. Given the very small mass of this comet, the orbit of the binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by the gravity of the Sun and planets.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the types}} of insects {{consumed}} are many families of beetles, wasps and ants, flies (families Tabanidae and Asilidae), bugs, and caterpillars. Other invertebrates eaten include spiders, millipedes and earthworms. The flame robin consumes small prey items whole, and bashes larger victims against a hard surface repeatedly <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> before eating. The latter group constitute only 0.5% of prey over time—seasonally varying {{from a peak of}} 1.8% in autumn to a low of 0.2% of prey caught in winter.|$|E

Riley Abel steps in <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> the fight, beating one of the boys and making the others flee. Ellie becomes angered by this, claiming that she can take care of herself. Riley then advises Ellie to flee, but the latter is caught and assigned to cleaning duty. While she is completing the chore, she realizes that Riley stole her Walkman, and later demands that she return it, which Riley reluctantly does.|$|E
5|$|At the lek, {{males have}} been {{observed}} <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> into pairs, performing “confrontation displays”. This consists of facing each other while bowing, jumping, and flapping their wings, sometimes even snapping their bills, {{and at the same}} time giving off various squawking and grunting calls. When the female approaches, it becomes even more intense. The display turns into a cacophony of bright color and a frenzied activity filling the air with very strange sounds.|$|E

5|$|Benítez {{was also}} {{prepared}} <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> his winning side {{after the final}} {{with a number of}} players expected to leave the club to make way for new arrivals. One of those leaving was Vladimír Šmicer, who had scored Liverpool's second goal in Istanbul, and whose contract was known not to be renewed before the final, meaning he entered knowing the final was his last game for the club.|$|E
5|$|Cicadas use {{a variety}} of {{strategies}} to evade predators. Large cicadas can fly rapidly to escape if disturbed. Many are extremely well camouflaged to evade predators such as birds that hunt by sight. As well as being coloured like tree bark, they are disruptively patterned <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> their outlines; their partly transparent wings are held over the body and pressed close to the substrate. The wings are antireflective, avoiding the typical shine of insect cuticle, which would break the cicada's camouflage. Some cicada species play dead when threatened.|$|E

5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} {{is common}} in military usage, for military vehicles, for firing positions and other installations, and for individual soldiers, where uniforms, equipment such as helmets, and face paint may be used <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> outlines and features. Disruptive coloration, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be given away by other factors including shape, shine, and shadow.|$|E
5|$|During the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars the cavalry's main {{offensive}} {{role was}} as shock troops. In defence cavalry {{were used to}} attack and harass the enemy's infantry flanks as they advanced. Cavalry were frequently used prior to an infantry assault, to force an infantry line to break and reform into formations vulnerable to infantry or artillery. Infantry frequently followed behind {{in order to secure}} any ground won or the cavalry could be used <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> enemy lines following a successful infantry action.|$|E
5|$|England batted on {{for five}} minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 365/8, with Evans on 47 not out. Johnston had the pick of the bowling figures, with 4/95. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin.|$|E

5|$|England batted on {{for five}} minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 8/365. Johnson ended with 1/85 from 21 overs and was the most uneconomical of the Australian bowlers, conceding runs {{at a rate of}} 4.04 per over while the others averaged 3.26. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley the right to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> the wicket, make it more likely to spin and therefore more difficult for Australia to bat on.|$|E
5|$|England {{declared}} at 8/365 {{after two}} overs {{on the last}} day. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> the wicket {{and make it more}} likely to spin. Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his belief that such a device would only make batting more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Half-demon Callie Maggotbone's demon father Aldermach is {{pressuring}} her <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> {{with her}} boyfriend Mark Lilly and marry Twayne Boneraper, to fulfill an ancient magical blood pact; Aldermach gets paid by Twayne's family to deliver him a bride, {{and if he does}} not, he will get murdered. Callie refuses to marry Twayne, and to prove that her relationship with Mark is serious, she invites him to move in with her, but does not tell him about her arranged marriage to Twayne. Meanwhile, Mark is having troubles at the Department of Integration; he receives rather negative feedback on his teacher evaluation forms from his students. Since the department cannot afford having individual sessions with students, he decides to hold them at his and his zombie roommate Randall's apartment. At his first session, Mark is kidnapped by Aldermach who bribes him <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> with Callie. Mark declines, and Callie's human mother Rosie shows up and argues with Aldermach, which gives Mark the idea to invite them both to therapy sessions. Following the session, Mark leaves the room for a short while, and when he comes back, Aldermach and Rosie are having sex and eventually get back together.|$|E
