While the Uzuki clan is heavily involved with assassinations and Alice is considered one of their best, she breaks away from her family and goes on the run, aspiring to becoming a successful musician. Eventually, Alice meets and befriends Saigō, leaving her open to blackmail from her own clan. She receives the order to either kill Kōshi or be responsible for Saigō's death. After nearly succeeding in the deed, Alice is stopped by Saigō, who tells her - <b>through</b> <b>interpreter</b> Momoko - that her hands were made to create music, not shed blood. Thanks to the other young martial artists' intervention, Alice finally manages to leave her clan behind and goes to France to study music.|$|E

40|$|Interpreters {{who work}} in {{community}} settings were surveyed in a worldwide study conducted in 1998 - 99. The aim of the survey was to gain insight from the interpreters’ perspective {{into the nature of}} community-based interpreting (CBI). Subjects were approached <b>through</b> <b>interpreter</b> associations (Critical Link and other network) worldwide. Practising interpreters were asked to give factual details of their work, languages, experience, and training, and to express their views on their role, working conditions, and status. They were also asked to identify qualities and skills needed for CBI and the guiding principles underlying their work. Most survey questions were open-ended to give respondents the opportunity to express their thoughts more fully. The final sample of 92 interpreters, mainly working in government settings, came from seven different countries. Survey findings answered some of the questions initially raised, and the results are presented in this report. 20 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} examines {{the perspectives of}} New Zealand-based telephone interpreters on the challenges they encounter at work. Telephone interpreting, as {{a new form of}} interpreting, is growing at a fast pace around the world and has been used widely in many different social service settings. However, little {{attention has been paid to}} the status quo of telephone interpreting services and the difficulties interpreters face. To the best of my knowledge, no research has been conducted in respect of telephone interpreting in New Zealand. The purpose of this study was to identify problems faced by telephone interpreters in New Zealand and provide possible solutions to address these difficulties <b>through</b> <b>interpreter</b> training and/or on-going professional development. The findings were based on a mixed method research study with a quantitative online survey and qualitative interviews. A total of 21 telephone interpreters participated in the survey and 9 telephone interpreters volunteered to be interviewed. The results indicated that for telephone interpreters in New Zealand the main challenges included a lack of information for preparation, the absence of visual messages and the difficulties of communicating with other parties (e. g. using direct/indirect speech, controlling turn-taking, interrupting the speakers, asking for clarification, avoiding side-talk and explaining the interpreter’s role). Additional challenges also included work stress, interpreters feeling isolated during interpreting work, the relatively low remuneration and the issues of work-life balance. The participants had developed, through their work experiences, their own strategies to deal with the problems stated above. According to the findings, most respondents in this research had participated in some form of interpreter training and had thought highly of such programmes. However, as the training they had had was on general interpreting, several respondents suggested it would be better to have training specifically on telephone interpreting. The study suggests that both interpreting education and on-going professional development, specifically through the accumulation of work experience, are important for telephone interpreters. It is also indicated that users of telephone interpreting services play an important part in telephone interpreting communication. If telephone interpreting users are educated on how to work with telephone interpreters, the communication will be more effective and efficient. Furthermore, it is also suggested that telephone interpreting providers develop a system on gathering feedback from users to help interpreters improve their performance. Telephone interpreters also need an open policy from employers regarding whether their interpreting performance will affect the employers’ prioritization of interpreters...|$|E
