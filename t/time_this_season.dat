5|$|Both clubs {{having been}} {{eliminated}} from the FA Cup, Small Heath arranged a friendly with Notts County, refereed by the Test cricketer and former England international footballer Billy Gunn, which gave {{them an opportunity to}} try out reserve players Jack Jones and Alec Leake. On a hard, snow-covered pitch, Billy Walton scored all three goals in a 3–3 draw, but the attendance of under a thousand, though understandable because of the weather conditions, was disappointing. Jones made his competitive debut, standing in for the injured Hallam, as Small Heath again struggled in muddy conditions and, for the fourth <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>season,</b> lost to West Bromwich Albion.|$|E

On their next drive, the Pros' passing game gave them the lone score, a passing {{touchdown}} from King to Nash in the first quarter. Once again, the Pros shutout the Bulldogs, winning 7–0. This was the first game played on Thanksgiving Day, which launched a yearly tradition.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{could only}} manage a 1–1 draw at Wimbledon on 3 April as Beckham’s well-drilled shot {{cancelled}} out Jason Euell's opener {{in the fifth}} minute. Despite several of the first-team members being rested for the Juventus tie, United won 3–0 at Old Trafford against Sheffield Wednesday and battled well to earn a point against Leeds at Elland Road after the midweek tie at Juventus.

5|$|A trip to The Dell on 3 October {{was taken}} with caution given United's return from Munich in the Champions League and winless record at the ground. The team lost to Southampton {{in each of}} their last three visits, {{including}} a 6–3 mauling in 1996. Despite dominating possession and clear-cut chances in the previous season’s fixture, United lost by a single goal leaving Ferguson to question when, not if he would eventually break the jinx. Andy Cole was paired with Yorke {{for only the second}} <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>season,</b> a tactic that paid off as both got on the score sheet. Substitute Jordi Cruyff added a third in the 75th minute to move United into second place in the table, four points behind leaders Aston Villa going into the international break. Raimond van der Gouw who deputised for injured goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel at Southampton featured again at home to Wimbledon, a match that Manchester United won 5–1, the biggest win of the season at Old Trafford. Ryan Giggs, Beckham, Yorke and Cole (twice) all scored; Ferguson in particular hailed the contribution of 19-year-old defender Wes Brown. United earned a point away at Derby County on 24 October, and deservedly beat Everton 4–1 at Goodison Park on Halloween to cut the gap at the top to just a point.|$|E
5|$|Hershey faced a {{challenging}} {{schedule for the}} end of its regular season, with only three of the last 14 games scheduled for home. This marked the fewest in team history, with a previous low of five games in the final 14 of 2002–03. The team also experienced significant roster changes in March, with Orlov, Oleksy and Schilling all being recalled to the Washington Capitals. Almeida and Kostenko were reassigned to the Reading Royals, Nicolas Deschamps joined the Bears roster, and Kevin Marshall was for defenseman Chay Genoway. Capitals winger Joey Crabb also cleared waivers and was assigned to Hershey on March 23.

5|$|For 1924–25, the Midland League was reorganised because eight Football League clubs withdrew their reserve {{teams from}} the competition. York {{finished}} sixth in the Principal Competition that concluded in February 1925 and were runners-up to Denaby United in the North Subsidiary Competition. The club struggled financially in this period, and was only kept going by the enthusiasm and generosity of the directors. John Fisher, one of these benefactors, was elected chairman in 1925. The Midland League was restored to its previous size for 1925–26 and York finished in 16th place after a poor start to the season, from which they never recovered. York enjoyed their most successful Midland League season in 1926–27, when they finished in sixth place and scored 96 goals in 38 league matches. They surpassed the FA Cup's qualifying rounds for the first <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>season,</b> being beaten 2–1 by Second Division team Grimsby Town at Blundell Park in the second round. In 1927, the club made its first serious attempt for election to the Football League, but Barrow and Accrington Stanley were re-elected instead. Fisher resigned as chairman in August 1927 and Brown took the position for the second time. After ranking seventh in the Midland League in 1927–28, York appointed their first official manager in July 1928, with Jock Collier named as player-manager. York finished ninth in 1928–29, and Jimmy Cowie was the divisional top scorer with 49 goals. This was York's last season in the Midland League as the club won election to the Football League on 3 June 1929, taking the place of Ashington in the Third Division North.|$|E
5|$|Hershey's seven-game point streak {{ended on}} February 16 with a 2–1 loss against Toronto.

In a 4–1 win against Rochester the next day, Grubauer blocked 35 shots, marking his personal high in the American Hockey League and the third <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>season</b> he held an opponent to one goal in regulation.

Taffe scored two power play goals for his first two-goal game for the Bears, and McNeill's three assists move his career points total to 146, making him eighth in all-time scoring among Hershey defensemen.

5|$|On October 26, Davis {{began the}} season with a 50-point, 16-rebound, 7-steal (career high), 5-assist, 4-block {{performance}} against the Denver Nuggets.
