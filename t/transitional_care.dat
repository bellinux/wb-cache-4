40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore, identify, and {{describe}} nursing functions employed in the provision of <b>Transitional</b> Followup <b>Care.</b> <b>Transitional</b> Followup <b>Care</b> was designed to accomplish earlier hospital discharge by substituting a portion of hospital care with a comprehensive program of discharge planning and home followup by nurse specialists. ^ The sample consisted of nursing process recordings and nurse specialist and client interviews about the nature of <b>Transitional</b> Followup <b>Care</b> provided by six nurse specialists to 22 subjects enrolled in the experimental group of the Early Discharge and Nurse Specialist Followup Program Project Grant. Subjects included women who had a cesarean birth, women who had pregnancies complicated by diabetes and hypertension, and women who had undergone a hysterectomy. ^ Nursing functions were categorized according to the existing Taxonomy of Ambulatory Care Nursing (Verran, 1981) to determine its accuracy in describing <b>Transitional</b> Followup <b>Care.</b> While the taxonomy was sufficiently comprehensive in naming the components of <b>Transitional</b> Followup <b>Care</b> it was insufficiently parsimonious, and therefore, inappropriate for use in describing <b>Transitional</b> Followup <b>Care.</b> ^ Through content analysis of the nursing process recordings and transcriptions of nurse specialist and client interviews, the Taxonomy of <b>Transitional</b> Followup <b>Care</b> was developed. The nursing process (Yura 2 ̆ 6 Walsh, 1988) was adopted as the framework for the Taxonomy. The nursing process components of assessment, diagnosis, plan of care, interventions, and evaluation serve as the five major categories of the Taxonomy. Subcategories for each were named and definitions developed. ^ The categories of assessment and intervention captured a majority of the functions. Variance was noted between the written and oral reports of nursing activities. Variance was also noted between the nurse specialist 2 ̆ 7 s reports of the care they provided and the client 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of the care they received. Discussion of results focuses on descriptions of nursing functions according to the Taxonomy of <b>Transitional</b> Followup <b>Care</b> Nursing and the differences between nurse and client reports.

Representative locations include (but are not limited to) hospitals, sub-acute and post-acute nursing homes, the patient’s home, primary and specialty care offices, and long-term care facilities. <b>Transitional</b> <b>care</b> is based on a comprehensive plan of care and the availability of health care practitioners who are well-trained in chronic care and have current information about the patient’s goals, preferences, and clinical status. It includes logistical arrangements, education of the patient and family, and coordination among the health professionals involved in the transition. <b>Transitional</b> <b>care,</b> which encompasses both the sending and the receiving aspects of the transfer, is essential for persons with complex care needs.|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} and classification of nursing practice functions {{has been identified}} as a major gap in the development of nursing knowledge (Lang, 1989). It is a crucial step needed to consistently document nursing effectiveness in improving patient outcomes, by linking nursing process and outcomes. The first step in this process is to classify the functions of APNs. ^ In this study the functions of APNs who cared for women who received early hospital discharge and home follow-up post cesarean delivery were classified using the Taxonomy of <b>Transitional</b> Follow-up <b>Care</b> (Arnold, 1991). This study was a secondary data analysis of the larger randomized control trial 2 ̆ 2 Early Discharge of Women Post Unplanned Cesarean Birth 2 ̆ 2. ^ The APNs recorded all nursing functions in caring for the early discharge patients on a standardized semi-structured log sheet. All nursing process recordings from the experimental-early discharge group (n = 61) were classified using the principles of latent content analysis to place data into the Taxonomy of <b>Transitional</b> Follow-up <b>Care.</b> ^ The Taxonomy of <b>Transitional</b> Follow-up <b>Care</b> was effective in capturing the functions of the APN. At level 1 of the Taxonomy, the most used categories were assessment and intervention. The direct care, teaching, and counseling categories contained the majority of functions at level 2 of the Taxonomy. At level 3 of the Taxonomy, the physiological category accounted for the largest number of functions. Only the general health and self/dependent care categories accounted for more than 10...|$|R

40|$|Patients visit {{multiple}} healthcare providers, obtain medications {{from multiple}} pharmacies and transition between settings, {{all of which}} can lead to inaccurate medication information and thus medication errors. To improve continuity of <b>care,</b> <b>transitional</b> pharmaceutical <b>care</b> programs are needed. These programs incorporate medication reconciliation (i. e. obtaining and evaluating a complete medication overview), patient counselling regarding medication changes and information transfer between healthcare providers. Continuity of pharmaceutical care is especially important at hospital discharge as the patient needs to resume responsibility for his medication and other healthcare providers, e. g. general practitioner and community pharmacist, need to guide the patient after hospital discharge. The objective of this thesis was to summarise existing evidence on interventions regarding discharge medication and to develop and evaluate a <b>transitional</b> pharmaceutical <b>care</b> program, developed by the hospital pharmacy, with respect to effects and costs. Existing evidence was summarised in a systematic review. Various discharge medication related interventions were reported to be mainly effective for process measures; 75 % of studies were effective for the outcome knowledge, 70 % for adherence and 93 % for DRPs. A limited number of studies reported effectiveness on morbidity; 18 % for readmission and 40 % for health services use. For the development of a <b>transitional</b> pharmaceutical <b>care</b> program the informational needs of general practitioners and patients regarding discharge medication, the additional contribution of patient participation in medication reconciliation, the labour costs versus the medication costs and the documentation of relevant discharge medication information by community pharmacies was assessed. General practitioners stated that discharge medication information was delayed. They desired information regarding the reasons for changes in the pharmacotherapy. Patients also expressed this need. Furthermore, patients expressed variable needs, e. g. regarding side-effects, so information at discharge should be tailored to individual needs. Patient participation was essential during medication reconciliation as discharge prescriptions were adjusted frequently after patient counselling due to discrepancies in use or need of drug therapy. The adjustments made by the hospital pharmacy resulted in higher medication cost savings after hospital discharge than the costs related to the net time investment (€ 56 savings per patient). However, continuity of pharmaceutical care after hospital discharge was shown to fail in the majority of community pharmacies as relevant discharge medication information (e. g. allergies/medication changes) was not documented in computer systems. The <b>transitional</b> pharmaceutical <b>care</b> program COACH (Continuity Of Appropriate pharmacotherapy, patient Counselling and information transfer in Healthcare) was evaluated in 365 patients versus 341 usual care patients. For all patients in the COACH program, interventions were performed to prevent drug-related problems (mean number of interventions: 10 per patient). Examples of interventions included re-starting of pre-admission prescribed medication, adjusting dosing schemes due to kidney malfunction and discontinuing redundant medication. Patients were significantly more satisfied with counselling provided by a hospital pharmacy member compared to the resident (69 % resident versus 87 % pharmacy). The COACH program did not decrease all-cause unplanned rehospitalisations. Further research will show whether medication-related rehospitalisations are decreased. A cost-effectiveness study showed that the COACH program was not considered cost-effective, although costs were 1000 euro less per patient for the COACH program...|$|R

As the cut-off points between frequent attenders and non frequent attenders (NFAs) we used the value of the third quartile (Q 3) of visits determined for the sex and age groups in the parallel study in the whole population. The analysis was performed for 23 variables: demographic characteristics of patients, disease characteristic and variables of physician. Logistic regressions were employed to identify the predictors of FAs/NFAs. 56. 9 % (in 1997) to 62. 4 % (in 2000) persons with diabetes were FAs, compared to 22. 4 % to 24. 3 % FAs patients in the whole population. Logistic regression analysis significantly differentiated the two group of visits with 68 % accuracy. 4 variables are significant predictors for FAs/NFAs: diabetes as the main disease (p = 0. 0005), diet-only-treatment (p = 0. 0062), treatment by secondary care (p = 0. 0116), and if glycated hemoglobin test (HbA 1 c) is determined (p = 0. 0272).
