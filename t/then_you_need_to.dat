This coverage resulted in invitations to talk show interviews by Geraldo Rivera, Phil Donahue and Oprah Winfrey. Though Zamora was openly gay, he chose to not make that explicit point to school children, preferring to emphasize to them that he got the disease through unprotected sex, to underscore {{the fact that both}} homosexuals and heterosexuals could contract HIV. On July 12, 1993, he testified before the United States Congress, arguing for more explicit HIV/AIDS educational programs, saying, [...] "If you want to reach me as a young man [...] especially a young gay man of color [...] <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> give me information in a language and vocabulary I can understand and relate to." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2013 Giulio Fanti, {{professor}} of mechanical and thermal measurement at the University of Padua conducted a battery of experiments on various threads that he believes were cut from the shroud during the 1988 Carbon-14 dating, and concluded that they dated from 300 BCE to 400 CE, potentially placing the Shroud within the lifetime of Jesus of Nazareth. Because of {{the manner in which}} Fanti obtained the shroud fibers, many are dubious about his findings. The shroud’s official custodian, Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia of Turin, told Vatican Insider: [...] "As there is no degree of safety on the authenticity of the materials on which these experiments were carried out [...] the shroud cloth, the shroud's custodians cannot recognize any serious value to the results of these alleged experiments." [...] Barrie Schwortz, a member of the original STURP investigation team, commented on Fanti’s theory: [...] "But it would be more convincing if the basic research had first been presented in a professional, peer-reviewed journal. If you’re using old techniques in new ways, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> submit your approach to other scientists." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, he {{made the}} {{modestly}} successful Kingdom of Heaven, a film about the Crusades. The film starred Orlando Bloom, and marked Scott's first collaboration with the composer Harry Gregson-Williams. The Moroccan government sent the Moroccan cavalry as extras for some battle scenes. Unhappy with the theatrical version of Kingdom of Heaven (which he blamed on paying {{too much attention to}} the opinions of preview audiences in addition to relenting when Fox wanted 45 minutes shaved off), Scott supervised a director's cut of the film, the true version of what he wanted, which was released on DVD in 2006. The director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven has been met with critical acclaim, with Empire magazine calling the film an [...] "epic", adding: [...] "The added 45 minutes in the director’s cut are like pieces missing from a beautiful but incomplete puzzle." [...] "This is the one that should have gone out" [...] reflected Scott. Asked if he was against previewing in general in 2006, Scott stated: [...] "It depends who's in the driving seat. If you've got a lunatic doing my job, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> preview. But a good director should be experienced enough to judge what he thinks is the correct version {{to go out into the}} cinema." ...|$|E

2500|$|As long as {{the initial}} {{assumptions}} in the estimate are reasonable quantities, the result obtained will give an answer within the same scale as the correct result, and if not gives a base for understanding why this is the case.

First looking for errors, then for factors the estimation didn't take account of - Does Chicago have a number of music schools or other places with a disproportionately high ratio of pianos to people? Whether close or very far from the observed results, the context the estimation provides gives useful information both about the process of calculation and the assumptions that have been used to look at problems.|$|R

In a recent article, Trainor et al. have shown that specific aspects of musical structure are processed automatically in the human brain, raising the question of whether our response to music has specifically evolved or merely occurs as a side-effect of neural architecture.

40|$|Pivot is a {{word that}} you hear a lot in startup land. It didn’t make my list of {{annoying}} phrases back in January but it could have. This is mainly because of its over use and, often, due to people misunderstanding what it means in the startup context. In this video made a SXSW, Eric Ries explains exactly what it means to pivot within a startup. You may remember Ries from his now infamous book, The Lean Startup. So, what is a pivot? A pivot is a change in strategy without a change in vision. If you’ve hit a wall, your experiments are no longer working <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> may <b>need</b> <b>to</b> pivot...|$|R

If <b>you</b> are coming up short, you are most likely throwing the trick too soon, letting your arms out, or not throwing the trick sideways.

40|$|Wireless {{networking}} is today’s glamour technology. We {{can hardly}} {{pick up a}} technology publication without encountering articles extolling its virtues or excoriating its faults. Wireless networking refers to technology that enables two or more computers to communicate using standard network protocols, but without network cabling.

A wireless networking system would rid of the downtime you would normally have in a wired network due to cable problems.

Less obviously, if you want to walk close to the object, and the object lies astride the st plane, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> images taken at finely spaced positions on the uv plane (in the two-plane parameterization shown above), which is now behind you, and these images <b>need</b> <b>to</b> have high spatial resolution.|$|R
