Realizable launch opportunities to 1943 Anteros occur about every two years, and the 1987 and 1990 opportunities are being extensively studied. The mission craft would carry remote sensing instruments and obtain the shape, size, surface structure, rotation rate, axis of rotation and color differences of the asteroid. The chemical composition of the surface and the gravitational field would be studied. Although a free fall landing on the surface is feasible, a soft landing that takes account of the asteroid's gravity and rotation is desirable.

40|$|Groundbased radar is an intelligence-gathering {{tool that}} is uniquely {{able to reduce}} {{uncertainty}} in NE 0 trajectories and physical properties. A single radar detection secures the orbit well enough to prevent “loss ” of newly discovered asteroids, shrinking the instantaneous positional uncertainty at the object’s next close approach by orders of magnitude with respect to an optical-only orbit. This conclusion, reached initially by Yeomans et al. (1 987) through Monte Carlo simulations, has been substantiated quantitatively by comparison of residuals for radar+optical and optical-only positional predictions for recoveries of NEAs {{during the past decade}} (Ostro et al. 2002). Integration of an asteroid’s orbit is afflicted by uncertainties that generally increase with the length of time from epochs spanned by astrometry. Eventually the uncertainties get so large that the integration becomes meaningless. The duration of accurate orbit integration defines our window of knowledge about the object’s whereabouts. Presumably we want to find out if any given NE 0 might <b>threaten</b> <b>collision</b> and if so, we would like as much warning as possible. Radar observations dramatically extend NE 0 trajectory predictability intervals far beyond what is possible with optical data alone, often approaching the end of this millennium (e. g., 1999 JM 8...|$|R
60|$|How {{he first}} {{got in touch}} with his captain's wife Powell relates in this way. It was long before his memorable {{conversation}} with the mate and shortly after getting clear of the channel. It was gloomy weather; dead head wind, blowing quite half a gale; the Ferndale under reduced sail was stretching close-hauled across the track of the homeward bound ships, just moving through the water and no more, since there was no object in pressing her and the weather looked threatening. About ten o'clock at night he was alone on the poop, in charge, keeping well aft by the weather rail and staring to windward, when amongst the white, breaking seas, under the black sky, he made out the lights of a ship. He watched them for some time. She was running dead before the wind of course. She will pass jolly close--he said to himself; and then suddenly he felt a great mistrust of that approaching ship. She's heading straight for us--he thought. It was not his business {{to get out of the}} way. On the contrary. And his uneasiness grew by the recollection of the forty tons of dynamite in the body of the Ferndale; not the sort of cargo one thinks of with equanimity in connection with a <b>threatened</b> <b>collision.</b> He gazed at the two small lights in the dark immensity filled with the angry noise of the seas. They fascinated him till their plainness to his sight gave him a conviction that there was danger there. He knew in his mind what to do in the emergency, but very properly he felt that he must call the captain out at once.|$|R
40|$|AbstractDirected energy laser {{ablation}} {{at the surface}} of an asteroid or comet produces an ejection plume that will impart a thrust on the asteroid. This thrust can mitigate a <b>threatened</b> <b>collision</b> with the Earth. This technique uses the asteroid itself as the deflection propellant. The DE-STAR laser system is designed to produce a sufficiently intense spot {{on the surface of}} an asteroid to accomplish this in one of two operational modes. One is a complete “stand-off” mode where a large space based phased-array laser directed energy system can interdict asteroids at large distances allowing sufficient time to mitigate nearly all known threats. A much smaller version of the same system, called DE-STARLITE, {{can be used in a}} “stand-on” mode by taking a much smaller laser to the asteroid and slowly deflecting it over a sufficiently long period of time. Here we present orbital simulations for a range of near-Earth asteroid impact scenarios for both the stand-off and stand-on systems. Simulated orbital parameters include asteroid radius and composition, initial engagement time, total laser-on time and total energy delivered to target. The orbital simulations indicate that, for exposures that are less than an orbital time, the thrust required to divert an asteroid is generally inversely proportional to laser-on time, proportional to target mass and proportional to the desired miss distance. We present a detailed stand-on scenario, consistent with current dedicated mission capabilities, to show the potential for {{laser ablation}} to allow significant deflection of targets with small systems. As one example we analyze a DE-STARLITE mission scenario that is in the same mass and launch envelope as the proposed Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) but using a multi kilowatt class laser array capable of deflecting a 325 m diameter asteroid with 2 N of thrust for 15 years in a small fraction of even the smallest SLS block 1 launch vehicle configuration...|$|R

40|$|Debris {{impact on}} marine {{wildlife}} {{has become a}} major issue of concern. Mainy species have been identified as being <b>threatened</b> by <b>collision,</b> entanglement or ingestion of debris, generally plastics, which constitute the predominant part of the recorded marine debris. Assessing sensitive areas, where exposure to debris are high, is thus crucial, in particular for sea turtles which have been proposed as sentinels of debris levels for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and for the Unep-MedPol convention. Our objective here was to assess sea turtle exposure to marine debris in the 3 metropolitan French fronts. Using aerial surveys performed in the Channel, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean regions in winter and summer 2011 – 2012, we evaluated exposure areas and magnitude in terms of spatial overlap, encounter probability and density of surrounding debris at various spatial scales. Major overlapping areas appeared in the Atlantic and Mediterranean fronts, concerning mostly the leatherback and the loggerhead turtles respectively. The probability for individuals to be in contact with debris (almost 100 % of individuals within a radius of 2 km) and the density of debris surrounding individuals (up to 88 items within a radius of 10 km) were very high, whatever the considered spatial scale, especially in the Mediterranean region and during the summer season. The comparison of the observed mean debris density with random distribution suggested that turtles selected debris areas. This may occur if both debris and turtles drift to the same areas due to currents, if turtles meet debris accidentally by selecting high food concentration areas, and/or if turtles actively seek debris out, confounding them with their preys. Various factors such as species-specific foraging strategies or oceanic features which condition the passive diffusion of debris, and sea turtles in part, may explain spatio-temporal variations in sensitive areas. Further research on exposure to debris is urgently needed. Empirical data on sea turtles and debris distributions, such as those collected aerially, are essential to better identify the location and the factors determining risks...|$|R
40|$|Bird {{mortality}} at transparent barriers (noise barriers or common house windows) {{is undoubtedly}} very important environmental issue, {{because of the}} rapid development of human society and even more rapid growth of very dangerous places for birds. At this time there is no review article yet, that would synthesize each sub-study {{on the extent to}} which individuals can die on those obstacles, which factors are critical for the ability of obstacle avoiding, how much <b>collision</b> <b>threaten</b> the vitality of bird populations and if we can prevent such unintended damage. This bachelor thesis handle with these questions as a literary review. From the available information we can suggests that the most important factor is migration behavior of birds, individuals migrating through the night are much more at risk than those migrating during the day, mostly because of light pollution, which can confuse them. The most dangerous time of year in this direction is clearly autumn, and that also relates with migration. Population losses caused by collision to the transparent barriers can be up to 20 % of the total population per year. Thesis in addition to a summary of available information on the issue proposes and evaluates possible preventive aplications, which may further serve to effective conservation for birds among [...] ...|$|R

Oregon, initially {{to the rear of the}} action but the fastest ship in the U.S. fleet, soon raced past Indiana, which had an engine problem and could make only [...] at the time of the battle. Iowa had started from a disadvantaged position and was passed by Infanta Maria Teresa but hit her with two [...] rounds from [...] and swung into the chase. As Iowa was passed in turn by Cristóbal Colón, the Spanish ship hit her with two shots from her secondary battery. One of these struck near the waterline and caused Iowa to slow and she therefore engaged Almirante Oquendo, bringing up the rear of Cervera's four cruisers.
