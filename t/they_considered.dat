5|$|The Cabildo met at 9am and {{rejected}} Cisneros' resignation. <b>They</b> <b>considered</b> that {{the crowd had}} no legitimate right to influence something that the Cabildo had already decided and implemented. <b>They</b> <b>considered</b> that, as the Junta was in command, the demonstration should be suppressed by force, and made the members responsible for any changes to {{the resolution of the}} previous day. To enforce those orders, they summoned the chief commanders, but these did not obey. Many of them, including Saavedra, did not appear. Those that did stated that they could not support the government order, and that the commanders would be disobeyed if they ordered the troops to repress the demonstrators.|$|E
5|$|The {{cladistic}} analysis done by Selles and Galobart in 2015 recovered Cairanoolithus as {{a sister}} taxon to the clade of ornithopod eggs Guegoolithus, Spheroolithus, and Ovaloolithus. Therefore, <b>they</b> <b>considered</b> {{it likely that}} Cairanoolithus belongs to a non-ornithopod ornithischian dinosaur.|$|E

5|$|According to {{journalist}} , Enderlin's {{coverage of}} the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was respected by other journalists but was regularly criticized by pro-Israel groups.

5|$|According to the parataxonomic {{system used}} to {{classify}} fossil eggs, Gobioolithus is {{classified in the}} oofamily Gobioolithidae, which, in turn, is classified in the prismatic morphotype (also called the neognath morphotype) of the ornithoid basic type. A cladistic analysis performed by Varricchio and Barta (2015) (pictured below) found Gobioolithus to be a sister taxon to Styloolithus. However, <b>they</b> <b>considered</b> Styloolithus different enough from Gobioolithus to warrant its excluslion from Gobioolithidae.|$|E
5|$|Aetosauria {{was first}} named in 1889 by English naturalist Richard Lydekker and {{zoologist}} Henry Alleyne Nicholson. <b>They</b> <b>considered</b> Aetosauria {{to be one}} of three suborders of the order Crocodilia, the other two being Parasuchia (a Triassic group) and Eusuchia (a group including all post-Triassic crocodiles). At the time, Cope considered Aetosauria to belong to Rhynchocephalia, an order of reptiles that includes the living tuatara. He also thought that the tightly fitting osteoderms, which were thought to be fused to the ribs, indicated that aetosaurs were transitional between rhynchocephalians and turtles. Nicholson and Lydekker placed a single family within the suborder, Aëtosauridæ. <b>They</b> <b>considered</b> aetosaurs to be similar to living crocodilians apart from their elongated metatarsals, which were compared to those of dinosaurs. In fact, Marsh considered aetosaurs to be closely related to dinosaurs because both had similar metatarsals.|$|E
50|$|One small sect of Samaritans {{is still}} extant. The Samaritan faith {{and that of}} other Jews diverged over two millennia ago. <b>They</b> <b>consider</b> {{themselves}} to be B'nei Yisrael ("Children of Israel"), a term used universally by Jewish denominations for the Jewish people as a whole, but do not call themselves Yehudim. The word Yehudim comes from the hebrew word Yehudi which means from the tribe of Judah, <b>they</b> <b>consider</b> themselves to be descendants of the tribes of Efraim and Manasseh.

5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, {{the success of}} deep-bore {{electric}} trains on the Underground suggested that local services out of London could also be electrified. Following the war, the GER needed more capacity out of Liverpool Street as it was at capacity (serving almost 230,000 passengers daily in 1921), {{but they could not}} afford electrification. <b>They</b> <b>considered</b> high powered and high tractive steam locomotives including the GER Class A55 as a possible alternative, but these were rejected because of high track loadings.|$|E
