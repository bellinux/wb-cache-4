5000|$|The {{most recent}} {{incident}} in 2010 occurred when a 10-year storm blew in causing white cap waves {{to wash the}} pier out to sea. It {{was assumed to be}} lost with the Jamesway hut, telephone pole, bollards, and other equipment still on it.

2500|$|All lines but the Yellow Line are {{equipped}} with automatic train control. Generally, the train operator does the closing of doors and starts the DA (Départ automatique, automatic departure), and then the train drives itself. The train operator can also drive the train manually {{at his or her}} discretion. Signalling is effected through coded pulses sent through the rails. Coded speed orders and station stop positions transmitted through <b>track</b> <b>beacons</b> are captured by beacon readers mounted under the driver cabs. The information sent to the train's electronic modules conveys speed information, and {{it is up to the}} train automatic control system computer to conform to the imposed speed. Additionally, the train computer can receive energy-saving instructions from <b>track</b> <b>beacons,</b> providing the train with four different economical coasting modes, plus one mode for maximum performance. In case of manual control, track speed is displayed on the cab speedometer indicating the maximum permissible speed. The wayside signals consist of point (switch/turnout) position indicators in proximity to switches and inter-station signalling placed at each station stop. Trains often reach their maximum speed of [...] in 16 to 26 seconds depending on grade and load.|$|R
25|$|Trains are {{programmed}} {{to stop at}} certain station positions with a precise odometer (accurate to plus or minus five centimetres). They receive their braking program and station stop positions orders (one-third, two-thirds, or end of station) from <b>track</b> <b>beacons</b> prior to entering the station, with additional beacons in the station for ensuring stop precision. The last beacon is positioned at precisely 12 turns of wheels {{from the end of}} the platform, which help improve the overall precision of the system.|$|R

50|$|The 250 kg {{bare and}} 750 kg loaded rowboat was {{equipped}} with many advanced navigational, safety and communications systems {{as well as a}} pair of 12 volt gel batteries charged by a solar panel that powered them all. The loaded rowboat contained an Argos <b>tracking</b> <b>beacon,</b> an EPIRB distress beacon, satellite phone, GPS navigator, radar transponder, radar reflector, VHF radio, palm-size computer, one manually operated and two powered desalination units, a medical kit, a watertight cabin and a life raft with an emergency bag of supplies.|$|R
5000|$|The group {{plans to}} steal several <b>tracking</b> <b>beacons</b> {{from a school}} used as a labor {{exchange}} facility, {{with the help of}} their [...] "inside man" [...] Arnie. These beacons are to be placed on fuel trucks so they can be tracked and hijacked. However, Arnie betrays the team in order to protect his children, forcing the team to kill him and eliminate all forces in the camp. They discover a mass grave in the school's baseball field and narrowly escape Korean reinforcements by hiding among the bodies.|$|R
5000|$|The handgun {{takes the}} form of only a gun handle when not activated, but {{projects}} a barrel, finger guard and a holographic function display when activated. It has several different kinds of selectable ammunition (e.g., normal bullets, explosive bullets, various <b>tracking</b> <b>beacons</b> or darts). It appears that the gun never needs reloading so the ammunition is probably somehow generated or manufactured by the gun itself and it also has user identification so that it will emit a lethal charge to the user if he/she is unauthorized.|$|R
5|$|Testing {{then moved}} to Kwajalein. The first test on 21 March 1963 failed when the MTR failed to lock onto the missile. A second on 19 April also failed when the missile's <b>tracking</b> <b>beacon</b> failed 30 seconds before intercept. The third test, this time using an actual target {{consisting}} of an Agena-D upper stage equipped with a Zeus miss-distance transmitter, was carried out on 24 May 1963, and was a complete success. From that point until 1964, one DM-15S was kept {{in a state of}} instant readiness and teams continually trained on the missile.|$|R
50|$|It was {{believed}} that the improper pitch signals on Samos 4's launch vehicle had been caused by accidental separation of a heat shield covering the retrorockets on the Atlas equipment pods. This would have caused aerodynamic heating of the pitch gyro, and the failure was extremely similar to an incident {{that occurred during the}} launch of Midas 4 a month earlier, and it led to redesigned heat shields over the retrorockets. The guidance system <b>tracking</b> <b>beacon</b> had also failed in flight, causing the absence of programmed BECO/SECO commands.|$|R
5000|$|Asset {{location}} tracking software often takes {{one of two}} approaches to monitoring asset locations. The first approach {{is to use a}} physical tracking device to provide data on physical location. This can {{take the form of a}} Bluetooth <b>tracking</b> <b>beacon</b> or a GPS tracking unit. The second approach is to track a location by the [...] "responsible party". In this approach the software uses peer to peer assign and accept procedures to allow individuals to accept responsibility for assets. The asset location is then inferred based upon the person who has accepted responsibility.|$|R
5000|$|Factual's Geopulse {{software}} employs location-based data-mining for geotargeting advertisements to smartphone users. Geopulse {{makes use}} of location-tracking data (since each smartphone acts by default as a GPS <b>tracking</b> <b>beacon,</b> and much can be learned about each user's interests, income, and spending habits simply by virtue of where each person spends his/her time), data gathered from trusted data providers, and other sources (such as census data). This enables highly specific ads to be targeted to users when they {{are most likely to}} be [...] "receptive" [...] (i.e. vulnerable) to the influence of advertising.|$|R
5000|$|Babylon 5 station {{personnel}} use a {{short range}} Communication Link (typically referred to {{simply as a}} [...] "link") {{to communicate with each}} other's within the station. They also have a <b>tracking</b> <b>beacon</b> built in. The links attach to the back of one's hand. The links are bio-coded and designed so they can not be used by anyone except their owner. In the Season Five episode Objects in Motion, however, an assassin kills a security guard, steals his link, and manages to bypass the coding and listen in to security communication.|$|R

5000|$|Because of the {{fast-changing}} viewing geometry during passes, {{the direction}} in which the gimbal must point throughout the pass must be pre-computed. [...] The list of directions for the gimbal to point was calculated based on the ISS GPS state vector and attitude quaternion. [...] The need for this list to be accurate was very important because of error in ISS orientation predictions and because the gimbal lacked any encoders, so all gimbal movement had to be done through dead reckoning. [...] Once the flight system detects the beacon from the ground system, it <b>tracks</b> <b>beacon</b> with the gimbal.|$|R
5000|$|The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course is a 2002 {{adventure}} comedy film {{based on}} the nature documentary series The Crocodile Hunter. It stars Steve Irwin and his wife Terri Irwin and was directed by frequent Irwin collaborator John Stainton. The film was released in between the 4th and 5th seasons of the series. The film follows Steve and Terri who attempt to save a crocodile from [...] "poachers" [...] not knowing {{that the two men}} are actually American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents who are after them because the crocodile in the Irwins' possession has accidentally swallowed an important satellite <b>tracking</b> <b>beacon.</b>|$|R

50|$|Most current PTC {{implementations}} {{also use}} the speed control unit to store a database of track profiles attached {{to some sort of}} navigation system. The unit keeps track of the train's position along the rail line and automatically enforces any speed restrictions as well as the maximum authorized speed. Temporary speed restrictions can be updated before the train departs its terminal or via wireless data links. The track data {{can also be used to}} calculate braking curves based on the grade profile. The navigation system can use fixed <b>track</b> <b>beacons</b> or differential GPS stations combined with wheel rotation to accurately determine the train's location on the line within a few feet.|$|R
50|$|In G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, the Pit {{is located}} in Egypt. It's a massive, {{high-tech}} facility {{that serves as the}} primary headquarters for G.I. Joe. The first level consists of a large hangar for transport craft, while subsequent levels have training facilities, a large pool for submarine warfare training, and living quarters. Cobra discovers the base's location with a <b>tracking</b> <b>beacon</b> and launches a surprise attack to retrieve the nano-mite warheads G.I. Joe is protecting. Though Cobra is successful in stealing the warheads and causing significant damage and casualties, the Pit remains operational. However, {{at the end of the}} film, G.I. Joe officially decommissions and abandons the Pit, shifting their operations to the USS Flagg.|$|R
50|$|Kressh's {{forces have}} arrived at Khar Delba and have opened fire at Sadow's {{apparently}} defenseless fortress. Sadow convinces Daragon that she must return to the Republic before the fortress is destroyed. Reluctant to leave her brother behind, she agrees. After the Starbreaker 12 has escaped to hyperspace, Sadow calls in his fleet that he had hidden on {{the dark side of}} Khar Shian. But that is not all; Massassi warriors on the ships of Horak-mul and Dol Gal-ram kill the Sith Lords and direct their fire on Kressh, who {{has no choice but to}} retreat. After this victory, Sadow prepares his forces to invade the Republic, using the <b>tracking</b> <b>beacon</b> hidden on the Starbreaker 12.|$|R

40|$|The Doppler {{difference}} method {{as applied}} to track the GEOS 3 spacecraft is discussed. In this method a pair of 2 GHz ground tracking stations simultaneously <b>track</b> a spacecraft <b>beacon</b> to generate an observable signal in which bias and instability of the carrier frequency cancel. The baselines are formed by the tracking sites at Bermuda, Rosman, and Merritt Island. Measurements were made {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the Doppler differencing procedure in <b>tracking</b> a <b>beacon</b> target with the high dynamic rate of the GEOS 3 orbit. Results indicate the precision of the differenced data to be at a level comparable to the conventional precise two way Doppler tracking...|$|R
50|$|The LFSW {{requirement}} specified a rocket-powered missile, {{armed with}} a conventional warhead, that would have an effective range of at least 55 km. The LSFW missile was required to be equally as effective against soft targets as the naval guns and the unguided rockets that {{it was intended to}} replace. Studies regarding the guidance system of the LFSW were conducted by the Applied Physics Laboratory, which determined that the ideal solution for the new missile was for it to utilise inertial guidance during the midcourse phase of its flight. Terminal guidance would be provided by a <b>tracking</b> <b>beacon,</b> operated by the troops in the battle area. The missile, having locked onto the beacon, would offset from the beacon's position by an amount specified in the beacon signal, thereby striking the target {{with a high degree of}} accuracy.|$|R
25|$|Upon the Falcons {{arrival at}} the {{location}} of Alderaan, the group discovers that the planet has been destroyed by order of the Death Star's commanding officer, Grand Moff Tarkin, as a show of power. The Falcon is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam and brought into its hangar bay. While Obi-Wan goes to disable the tractor beam, Luke discovers that Leia is imprisoned aboard, {{and with the help of}} Han and Chewbacca, rescues her. After several escapes, the group makes its way back to the Falcon. Obi-Wan disables the tractor beam, and, on the way back to the Falcon, he engages in a lightsaber duel with Vader. Once he is sure the others can escape, Obi-Wan allows himself to be killed. The Falcon escapes from the Death Star, unknowingly carrying a <b>tracking</b> <b>beacon,</b> which the Empire follows to the Rebels' hidden base on Yavin IV.|$|R
50|$|The Tracy family, led {{by former}} {{astronaut}} Jeff Tracy, operate International Rescue, a secret organization that aids those in need using the technologically advanced machines called Thunderbirds. The youngest son Alan lives at a boarding school on the mainland dreaming of being a Thunderbird pilot. He and his friend Fermat Hackenbacker, son of the Thunderbirds’ engineer Brains, are picked up by Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward and her butler Aloysius Parker. Lady Penelope is an International Rescue agent, travelling to Tracy Island in the South Pacific in her limo FAB 1. The Thunderbirds return from an oil rig fire, but Alan and Fermat play around in Thunderbird 1, discovering a strange compound splattered on the side.
