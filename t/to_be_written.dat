5|$|Most of the Sinhalese {{letters are}} curlicues; {{straight}} lines are almost completely {{absent from the}} alphabet. This is because Sinhala used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> on dried palm leaves, which would split along the veins on writing straight lines. This was undesirable, and therefore, the round shapes were preferred.|$|E

The first section, chapters one <b>to</b> five, <b>was</b> <b>written</b> by George Plympton. The middle section, chapters six <b>to</b> ten, <b>was</b> <b>written</b> by Hoerl.

There are also infinitives corresponding to other aspects: (<b>to)</b> have <b>written,</b> (<b>to)</b> <b>be</b> <b>writing,</b> (<b>to)</b> have <b>been</b> <b>writing.</b> The second-person imperative <b>is</b> identical <b>to</b> the (basic) infinitive; other imperative forms may be made with let (let us go, or lets go; let them eat cake).|$|R

Some corrections seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> by prima manu (e.g. Matthew 4:10; 5:19) others plainly secondary manu (Matthew 6; Luke 3; 10:35). The apostrophe is used even when not required, especially in εξ', and ουκ'.|$|E
5|$|Calleia {{continued}} to battle typecasting, turning down well-paying villainous roles {{to develop more}} complex characters. His performance as police inspector Slimane in Walter Wanger's Algiers (1938) was recognized by the National Board of Review. Working with director John Farrow at RKO Pictures in 1939, he created a fine character study as the condemned anarchist in Five Came Back, and portrayed a heroic priest in Full Confession. Calleia was announced to star as Father Damien in an RKO picture <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> and directed by Farrow, but the project was not realized.|$|E
5|$|From the 9th century, Nuskhuri script {{starting}} becoming dominant, and {{the role}} of Asomtavruli was reduced. However, epigraphic monuments of the 10th to 18th centuries continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> in Asomtavruli script. Asomtavruli in this later period became more decorative. In the majority of 9th-century Georgian manuscripts which were written in Nuskhuri script, Asomtavruli was used for titles and the first letters of chapters. Although, some manuscripts written completely in Asomtavruli can be found until the 11th century.|$|E

5|$|Helena was {{closest to}} her brother, Prince Alfred, who {{considered}} her his favourite sister. Though described by contemporaries as fearfully {{devoted to the}} Queen, {{to the point that}} she did not have a mind of her own, she actively campaigned for women's rights, a field the Queen abhorred. Nevertheless, both she and Beatrice remained closest to the Queen, and Helena remained close to her mother's side until the latter's death. Her name was the last <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> in the Queen's seventy-year-old journal.|$|E

Not all modern Mayan languages have standardized orthographies, but the Mayan languages of Guatemala use a standardized, Latin-based phonemic spelling system developed by the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala (ALMG). Orthographies for the languages of Mexico are currently being developed by the Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas (INALI).|$|E

5000|$|Rongorongo ( [...] ; Rapa Nui: [...] ) is {{a system}} of glyphs {{discovered}} in the 19th century on Easter Island that appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>writing</b> or proto-writing. Numerous attempts at decipherment have been made, none successfully. Although some calendrical and what might prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> genealogical information has been identified, none of these glyphs can actually be read. If rongorongo does prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>writing</b> and proves <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an independent invention, {{it would be one}} of very few independent inventions of writing in human history.|$|R
5|$|In early August 1942, a small {{detachment}} of an American fighter control squadron had been stationed on Goodenough Island to provide advance {{warning to the}} Australian fighters based at Milne Bay. On 7 August, five Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) P-40 Kittyhawks of No. 76 Squadron made forced landings on the grassy plains. One crashed on landing and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> off, but after makeshift airstrips were cut through the grass, the remaining four were able to fly out again.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the freedom offered by the genres, gay {{characters}} often remain contrived and stereotypical, and most SF stories take for granted the continuation of heteronormative institutions. Alternative sexualities have usually been approached allegorically, or by including LGBT characters {{in such a way}} as to not contradict mainstream society's assumptions about gender roles. Works that feature gay characters are more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> by women writers, and to be viewed as being aimed at other women or girls; big-name male writers are less likely to explore gay themes.|$|E

5|$|Several {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to produce sequels and remakes in the decades following Caligaris release. Robert Wiene bought the rights to Caligari from Universum Film AG in 1934 with the intention of filming a sound remake, which never materialized before Wiene's death in 1938. He intended to cast Jean Cocteau as Cesare, and a script, believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> by Wiene, indicated the Expressionist style would have been replaced with a French surrealist style.|$|E
5|$|The ARC {{became the}} driving force behind the design and {{development}} of the oN-Line System (NLS). He and his team developed computer interface elements such as bitmapped screens, the mouse, hypertext, collaborative tools, and precursors to the graphical user interface. He conceived and developed many of his user interface ideas in the mid-1960s, long before the personal computer revolution, at a time when most computers were inaccessible to individuals who could only use computers through intermediaries (see batch processing), and when software tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> for vertical applications in proprietary systems.|$|E

5|$|The Vinaypatrika is {{considered}} {{as the last}} compositions of Tulsidas, believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> when Kali Yuga started troubling him.

Tulsidas attests in the last stanza of Vinaypatrika that Rama himself signed the manuscript of the work. The 45th stanza of the Vinaypatrika is sung as the evening Aarti by many Hindus.|$|E
5|$|The two {{official}} {{languages of}} the Republic of Ireland are Irish and English. Each language {{has produced a}} noteworthy literature.
