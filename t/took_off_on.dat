5|$|Beset {{by early}} {{construction}} problems, the first FSD aircraft {{was transferred to}} Groom Lake in May1981 inside a C-5. Further problems, this time with fuel leaks, delayed the first flight. Under the control of Harold Farley, the aircraft <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> 18June for its maiden flight, nine months after the July1980 first flight originally envisaged. The first production F-117A was delivered in 1982, and operational capability was achieved in October1983; the 59th and last F-117 was delivered in 1990.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August, Baker led {{a patrol}} of six {{aircraft}} over Lys. Five days later, he shot down a German balloon {{while on a}} lone mission in poor weather, scoring his third aerial victory. At dawn on 30 August, Baker <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> a sortie with Lieutenants Roy King and Oscar Ramsay. Over Laventie, the trio encountered three DFW C.Vs; Baker and King each disposed {{of one of the}} aircraft. Baker was granted two weeks' leave to the United Kingdom in early September. Towards the end of that month, No.4 Squadron relocated to Serny and was soon after re-equipped with the Sopwith Snipe. By the time of the conversion, Baker had achieved flying ace status on the Sopwith Camel, having been credited with shooting down six German aircraft by early October.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}}, 6. Staffel {{at the time}} was based in Petsamo, present-day Pechenga in Murmansk Oblast, Russia. Weissenberger <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> his first Bf109 combat mission at 14:00 on 15 September 1942 after he had spent a few days familiarizing himself with the {{single-engine}} fighter aircraft. The mission, flown by 10 Bf109 fighters from 6. Staffel, was a combat air patrol in the vicinity of Murmashi. The flight encountered enemy aircraft and Weissenberger filed claims over two Curtiss P-40 Warhawk Lend-Lease fighters shot down at 14:31 and 14:33. These were his first victories claimed on the Bf109, taking his total to 25 victories. A week later, on 22 September, Weissenberger and 6. Staffel were again patrolling the airspace near the Soviet airfield at Murmashi. During this mission, he claimed three more aerial victories, over Hurricanes shot down between 14:59 and 15:05.|$|E

5|$|The next day, 21 January 1944, Sayn-Wittgenstein, {{wireless}} operator Ostheimer {{and board}} mechanic Unteroffizier Kurt Matzuleit <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> a Zahme Sau (Tame Boar), {{a combination of}} ground controlled and airborne radar, night fighter intercept mission flying the Ju88R4+XM (Werknummer 750 467—factory number), which normally {{was assigned to the}} Technical Officer of NJG2. At 22:00 contact with the first of five Lancasters was established and shot down which was observed to explode at 22:05. Between 22:10 and 22:15 the second Lancaster was shot down. Observers reported the third Lancaster exploded at approximately 22:30, followed shortly by number four, which hit the ground at 22:40. During the fifth and final attack, the four-engined bomber was burning when their Ju 88 came under attack, presumably from British fighter escorts. In the attack, their left wing caught fire. Sayn-Wittgenstein ordered his crew to jump, and Ostheimer and Matzuleit parachuted to safety from the damaged aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Hill faced further {{problems}} as he {{planned for the}} operation. The American pilots of the Dakota transport aircraft that would transport the battalion were inexperienced and had never conducted a parachute drop before, {{and there was no}} time for any training or exercises. There were also no photos of the airfield or the surrounding areas, and only a single, smallscale map available for navigation. To ensure that the aircraft found the dropzone and delivered the battalion accurately, Hill sat in the cockpit of the leading Dakota and assisted the pilot. The Dakotas were escorted by four American P-38 Lightning fighters, which engaged and drove off two roving German fighters, but as the Dakotas approached the Tunisian border they encountered thick clouds and were forced to turn back, landing at Maison Blanche at 11:00. It was decided that the battalion would conduct the operation the next day, which allowed the paratroopers to rest for a night. 1st Parachute Battalion <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> the morning of 16 November, and enjoyed excellent weather that allowed the transport aircraft to drop the battalion accurately around the airfield at Souk elArba. Most of the paratroopers landed successfully, but one man was killed when his rigging line twisted around his neck middrop, throttling him; one officer broke his leg on landing, and four men were wounded when a Sten gun was accidentally fired. The battalion's secondincommand, Major Alastair Pearson, remained at the airfield with a small detachment that collected the airborne equipment and supervised the burial of the casualty.|$|E
5|$|II./NJG1 {{saw little}} {{action in the}} first few months of 1943, and Schnaufer did not claim his next aerial victory until 14 May 1943. II./NJG1 Himmelbett control areas were located to catch the bombers heading for the Ruhr Area. Bomber Command had made only ten major attacks in that region from January to April 1943. Consequently, II./NJG1 claimed no {{victories}} in January, two in February, one in March and three in April. Schnaufer's number of aerial victories increased again during the Battle of the Ruhr. Schnaufer, with Baro as his radio operator, shot down a No. 214 Squadron Short Stirling R9242 at 02:14 on 14 May 1943 on an attack mission against Bochum. Four members of the crew, including pilot Sergeant R. M. Gibney, lost their lives. His next victory on the same mission at 03:07, his 9th overall, was a No. 98 Squadron Halifax JB873 returning from Bochum. The captain, Sergeant G. Dane and 2nd pilot Sergeant J. H. Body were killed in the crash. On the night of 29/30 May, Bomber Command attacked Wuppertal. Schnaufer and Baro <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> the first wave at 23:51 on 29 May and returned at 02:31 on the 30 May. They shot down two Stirlings, one at 00:48 and the other at 02:22, and one Halifax at 01:43.|$|E

5|$|On 30 March 1943, 15./JG 52 {{transferred}} from Nikolayev to Kerch, and it flew the first missions of its second tour the following day. On 15 April, Dukovac and Feldwebel Viktor Mihelčić <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> a patrol of the Krymskaja–Abinskaja area, and Dukovac shot down a US-made Bell P-39 Airacobra. Five days later, Dukovac was late taking off and was {{catching up to}} his Schwarm when he downed a LaGG-3 fighter during an engagement with four of the Soviet aircraft, {{but there were no}} witnesses to confirm his claim. Later that day, he and three other pilots were escorting a group of Ju 87s and Junkers Ju 88 medium bombers when they came across 25 Soviet fighters and flying boats over the Black Sea. Dukovac claimed another LaGG-3, but again no-one witnessed it. The following morning, Dukovac was on patrol with another pilot near Karbardinovka when they came across six Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3 fighters. Dukovac claimed one, but the other pilot's aircraft was hit and they had to retire. Later that day, Dukovac and another pilot engaged several LaGG-3s between Novorossiysk and Gelendzhik; Dukovac claimed two, one of which was not witnessed. On 22 April, Dukovac was attacking shipping in Novorossiysk when he had to force-land his aircraft with engine problems. He flew another mission in a different aircraft later that day over the Black Sea, downing a Ilyushin DB-3 bomber.|$|E
5|$|Værnes {{is first}} {{recorded}} in the 10th century as the seat for one of eight chieftains in Trøndelag. The first military activity in the area was {{as a base for}} leidang. After the Viking Age, the farm at Værnes was taken over by the king and became the seat of the vogt. From 1671, the farm was owned by a series of military officers and public servants. In 1887, the farm was bought by the Royal Norwegian Army and converted to a camp. The first aircraft to use Værnes was a military Farman MF.7 Longhorn, which <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> 26 March 1914. It was part of the plan to establish the Norwegian Army Air Service, for which Værnes was chosen as the initial station for Central Norway. Radio equipment was installed in 1919 and the first hangar was built in 1920. By 1922, the grass field serving as runway has become insufficient for newer planes, both in terms of length and level, but an extension was not performed until 1925. In 1927, parliament passed legislation to move the division to Rinnleiret from 1930, but this was later annulled. With the delivery of Fokker aircraft in 1930, the runway was again upgraded and extended.|$|E
5|$|Hill faced further {{problems}} as he {{planned for the}} operation. The American pilots of the Dakota transport aircraft that would transport the battalion were inexperienced and had never conducted a parachute drop before, {{and there was no}} time for any training or exercises. There was also no photos of the airfield or the surrounding areas, and only a single, smallscale map available for navigation. To ensure that the aircraft found the dropzone and delivered the battalion accurately, Hill decided that he would sit in the cockpit of the leading Dakota and assist the pilot. Despite the battalion's parachutes only arriving at 16:30 on 14 November, and were packed twelve to a container which meant they had to be removed and individually repacked, the battalion was prepared by 15 November and took off at 07:30. The Dakotas were escorted by four American P-38 Lightning fighters, which engaged and drove off two roving German fighters, but as the Dakotas approached the Tunisian border, they encountered thick clouds and were forced to turn back, landing at Maison Blanche at 11:00. It was decided that the battalion would conduct the operation the next day, which allowed the paratroopers to rest for a night. At the same time, 2nd Battalion of the 509th PIR successfully conducted a drop at Tebessa, capturing its objectives and securing the area; it then passed from the control of 1st Parachute Brigade and remained in the area for some time. 1st Parachute Battalion <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> the morning of 16 November, and encountered excellent weather which allowed the transport aircraft to drop the battalion accurately around the airfield at Souk elArba.

25|$|Aviation safety author Andrew Brookes {{wrote that}} the true cause will never be known, but that pilot error induced by fatigue {{is likely to have}} played a part; the crew had been on flight duty for 9 hours and 15 minutes, {{including}} 6 hours flying time, before they <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> the crash flight.

25|$|On 27 October 1917 Rhys-Davids was {{promoted}} to lieutenant, backdated to 1 September 1917.

25|$|KLM's first {{intercontinental}} flight <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> 1 October 1924. The final destination was Jakarta (then called 'Batavia'), Java, in the Dutch East Indies; the flight used a Fokker F.VII with registration H-NACC and was piloted by Van der Hoop. In September 1929, regular scheduled services between Amsterdam and Batavia commenced. Until {{the outbreak of}} the Second World War in 1939, this was the world's longest-distance scheduled service by airplane. By 1926, it was offering flights to Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Brussels, Paris, London, Bremen, Copenhagen, and Malmö, using primarily Fokker F.II and Fokker F.III aircraft.|$|E
25|$|A {{second test}} flight, at the {{suggestion}} of Prof. Henry, was made from Cincinnati and was to return him to the eastern seaboard. For this flight he used the smaller balloon Enterprise. His flight <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> the early morning of April 19, 1861, two days after Virginia had seceded from the Union. The flight misdirected him to Unionville, South Carolina where he was put under house arrest as a Yankee spy. Having established his identity as a man of science, he was allowed to return home where he had received word from Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase to come to Washington with his balloon. The American Civil War permanently ended Lowe's attempt at a transatlantic crossing.|$|E
