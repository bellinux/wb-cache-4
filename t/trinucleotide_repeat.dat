5|$|HD is one {{of several}} <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeat</b> {{disorders}} which are caused by the length of a repeated section of a gene exceeding a normal range. The HTT gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 4 at 4p16.3. HTT contains a sequence of three DNA bases—cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG)—repeated multiple times (i.e.... CAGCAGCAG...), known as a <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeat.</b> CAG is the 3-letter genetic code (codon) for the amino acid glutamine, so a series of them results in the production of a chain of glutamine known as a polyglutamine tract (or polyQ tract), and the repeated part of the gene, the PolyQ region.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's {{disease has}} {{autosomal}} dominant inheritance, meaning that an affected individual typically inherits one {{copy of the}} gene with an expanded <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeat</b> (the mutant allele) from an affected parent. Since penetrance of the mutation is very high, {{those who have a}} mutated copy of the gene will have the disease. In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele and therefore being affected with the disorder (see figure). This probability is sex-independent.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeat</b> {{accounts}} for 60% {{of the variation in}} the age symptoms appear and the rate they progress. A longer repeat results in an earlier age of onset and a faster progression of symptoms. Individuals with more than sixty repeats often develop the disease before age 20, while those with fewer than 40 repeats may not ever develop noticeable symptoms. The remaining variation is due to environmental factors and other genes that influence the mechanism of the disease.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: Autism (MIM# 209850) and {{schizophrenia}} (MIM# 181500) {{are both}} neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders {{characterized by a}} highly genetic component. Homeogenes and forkhead genes encode transcription factors, which {{have been involved in}} brain development and cell differentiation. Thus, they are relevant candidate genes for psychiatric disorders. Genetic studies have reported an association between autism and DLX 2, HOXA 1, EN 2, ARX, and FOXP 2 genes whereas only three studies of EN 2, OTX 2, and FOXP 2 were performed on schizophrenia. Interestingly, most of these candidate genes contain <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeats</b> coding for polyamino acid stretch in which instability can be the cause of neurodevelopmental disorders. Our goal was to identify variations of coding <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeats</b> in schizophrenia, autism, and idiopathic mental retardation. METHODS: We screened the coding <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeats</b> of OTX 1, EN 1, DLX 2, HOXA 1, and FOXP 2 genes in populations suffering from schizophrenia (247 patients), autism (98 patients), and idiopathic mental retardation (56 patients), and compared them with control populations (112 super controls and 202 healthy controls). RESULTS: Novel deletions and insertions of coding <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeats</b> were found in the DLX 2, HOXA 1, and FOXP 2 genes. Most of these variations were detected in controls and no difference in their distribution was observed between patient and control groups. Two different polymorphisms in FOXP 2 were, however, found only in autistic patients and the functional consequences of these variations of repeats have to be characterized and correlated to particular clinical features. CONCLUSION: This study did not identify specific disease risk variants of <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeats</b> in OTX 1, EN 1, DLX 2, HOXA 1, and FOXP 2 candidate genes in neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders...|$|R
5|$|Medical {{diagnosis}} of the onset of HD can be made following the appearance of physical symptoms specific to the disease. Genetic testing {{can be used to}} confirm a physical diagnosis if there is no family history of HD. Even before the onset of symptoms, genetic testing can confirm if an individual or embryo carries an expanded copy of the <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeat</b> in the HTT gene that causes the disease. Genetic counseling is available to provide advice and guidance throughout the testing procedure, and on the implications of a confirmed diagnosis. These implications include the impact on an individual's psychology, career, family planning decisions, relatives and relationships. Despite the availability of pre-symptomatic testing, only 5% of those at risk of inheriting HD choose to do so.|$|E
5|$|About 99% of HD diagnoses {{based on}} the typical {{symptoms}} and {{a family history of}} the disease are confirmed by genetic testing to have the expanded <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeat</b> that causes HD. Most of the remaining are called HD-like (HDL) syndromes. The cause of most HDL diseases is unknown, but those with known causes are due to mutations in the prion protein gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2), a recessively inherited unknown gene (HDL3—only found in two families and poorly understood), and the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (SCA17, sometimes called HDL4). Other autosomal dominant diseases that can be misdiagnosed as HD are dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and neuroferritinopathy. There are also autosomal recessive disorders that resemble sporadic cases of HD. These include chorea acanthocytosis and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. One X-linked disorder of this type is McLeod syndrome.|$|E
5|$|All {{humans have}} {{two copies of}} the Huntingtin gene (HTT), which codes for the protein Huntingtin (HTT). The gene is also called HD and IT15, which stands for 'interesting {{transcript}} 15'. Part of this gene is a repeated section called a <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeat,</b> which varies in length between individuals and may change length between generations. If the repeat is present in a healthy gene, a dynamic mutation may increase the repeat count and result in a defective gene. When the length of this repeated section reaches a certain threshold, it produces an altered form of the protein, called mutant Huntingtin protein (mHTT). The differing functions of these proteins are the cause of pathological changes which in turn cause the disease symptoms. The Huntington's disease mutation is genetically dominant and almost fully penetrant: mutation of either of a person's HTT alleles causes the disease. It is not inherited according to sex, but {{the length of the}} repeated section of the gene and hence its severity can be influenced by the sex of the affected parent.|$|E

40|$|SummaryLengthy <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeats</b> {{encoding}} polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches {{characterize the}} variant proteins of Huntington's disease and certain other inherited neurological disorders. Using a phenotypic screen to identify events that restore functionality to polyQ proteins in S.  cerevisiae, {{we discovered that}} transcription elongation factor Spt 4 is required to transcribe long <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeats</b> located either in ORFs or nonprotein-coding regions of DNA templates. Mutation of SPT 4 selectively decreased synthesis of and restored enzymatic activity to expanded polyQ protein without affecting protein lacking long-polyQ stretches. RNA-seq analysis revealed limited effects of Spt 4 on overall gene expression. Inhibition of Supt 4 h, the mammalian ortholog of Spt 4, reduced mutant huntingtin protein in neuronal cells and decreased its aggregation and toxicity while not altering overall cellular mRNA synthesis.  Our findings identify a cellular mechanism for transcription through <b>repeated</b> <b>trinucleotides</b> and a potential target for countermeasures against neurological disorders attributable to expanded trinucleotide regions...|$|R
40|$|Tandem repeats in GenBank primate {{nucleotide}} sequences annotated as protein coding {{regions are}} analyzed. It is {{found that only}} <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeats</b> show repeat enrichment well above the threshold of statistical significance. The statistics are improved by a simultaneous search for repeats on both the amino acid and nucleotide levels. The results of the analyses of natural sequences are interpreted by comparing them {{with the results of}} the computer simulation of the model dedicated to protein coding regions. According to the simulation results, a limited set of trinucleotides, that is, cgg, ccg, cag, and gaa repeats coding for polyalanine, polyglycine, polyproline, polyglutamine, and polylysine are prone to proliferation. It is also found that within the repeat regions slippage is more frequent by a factor of 10 than point mutations, whereas the ratio of silent versus recognizable point mutations is approximately the same as elsewhere in coding regions. The <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeats</b> cover slightly more than 0. 3 % of the protein coding regions of genes...|$|R
25|$|Spinal and bulbar {{muscular atrophy}} (SBMA), {{also known as}} Kennedy's disease, is a severe {{neurodegenerative}} syndrome {{that is associated with}} a particular mutation of the androgen receptor's polyglutamine tract called a <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeat</b> expansion.

25|$|Repeated {{sequences}} {{of fewer than}} ten nucleotides (e.g. the dinucleotide repeat (AC)n) are termed microsatellite sequences. Among the microsatellite sequences, trinucleotide repeats are of particular importance, as sometimes occur within coding regions of genes for proteins and may lead to genetic disorders. For example, Huntington's disease results from {{an expansion of the}} <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeat</b> (CAG)n within the Huntingtin gene on human chromosome 4. Telomeres (the ends of linear chromosomes) end with a microsatellite hexanucleotide repeat of the sequence (TTAGGG)n.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{treatments}} are directed towards alleviating symptoms, not the disease itself. Many patients with hereditary or idiopathic forms of ataxia have other symptoms {{in addition to}} ataxia. Medications or other therapies might be appropriate {{for some of these}} symptoms, which could include tremor, stiffness, depression, spasticity, and sleep disorders, among others. Both onset of initial symptoms and duration of disease are variable. If the disease is caused by a polyglutamine <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeat</b> CAG expansion, a longer expansion may lead to an earlier onset and a more radical progression of clinical symptoms. Typically, a person afflicted with this disease will eventually be unable to perform daily tasks (ADLs). However, rehabilitation therapists can help patients to maximize their ability of self-care and delay deterioration to certain extent. Researchers are exploring multiple avenues for a cure including RNAi and the use of Stem Cells and several other avenues.|$|E
40|$|Highly {{polymorphic}} and transferable microsatellites (SSRs) {{are important}} for comparative genomics, genome analysis and phylogenetic studies. Development of novel species-specific microsatellite markers remains a costly and labor-intensive project. Therefore, interest has been shifted from genomic to genic markers owing to their high inter-species transferability as they are developed from conserved coding regions of the genome. This study concentrates on comparative analysis of genic microsatellites in nine important legume (Arachis hypogaea, Cajanus cajan, Cicer arietinum, Glycine max, Lotus japonicus, Medicago truncatula, Phaseolus vulgaris, Pisum sativum and Vigna unguiculata) and two model plant species (Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana). Screening {{of a total of}} 228090 putative unique sequences spanning 219610522 bp using a microsatellite search tool, MISA, identified 12. 18 % of the unigenes containing 36248 microsatellite motifs excluding mononucleotide repeats. Frequency of legume unigene-derived SSRs was one SSR in every 6. 0 kb of analyzed sequences. The <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeats</b> were predominant in all the unigenes with the exception of C. cajan, which showed prevalence of dinucleotide <b>repeats</b> over <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeats.</b> Dinucleotide <b>repeats</b> along with <b>trinucleotides</b> counted for more than 90 % of the total microsatellites. Among dinucleotide and <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeats,</b> AG and AAG motifs, respectively, were the most frequent.

500|$|Trinucleotide CAG repeats over 28 are {{unstable}} during replication, {{and this}} instability increases {{with the number}} of repeats present. This usually leads to new expansions as generations pass (dynamic mutations) instead of reproducing an exact copy of the <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeat.</b> This causes the number of repeats to change in successive generations, such that an unaffected parent with an [...] "intermediate" [...] number of repeats (28–35), or [...] "reduced penetrance" [...] (36–40), may pass on a copy of the gene with {{an increase in the number}} of repeats that produces fully penetrant HD. Such increases in the number of repeats (and hence earlier age of onset and severity of disease) in successive generations is known as genetic anticipation. Instability is greater in spermatogenesis than oogenesis; maternally inherited alleles are usually of a similar repeat length, whereas paternally inherited ones have a higher chance of increasing in length. It is rare for Huntington's disease to be caused by a new mutation, where neither parent has over 36 CAG repeats.|$|E

[...] This mutation is thought to cause a disturbance of the AR's target gene interaction that allows it to act at certain additional targets, possibly in conjunction with the estrogen receptor protein, to cause cancerous growth. The pathogenesis of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) demonstrates that even the mutant AR protein itself can result in pathology. [...] The <b>trinucleotide</b> <b>repeat</b> expansion of the polyglutamine tract of the AR gene that is associated with SBMA results in the synthesis of a misfolded AR protein that the cell fails to proteolyze and disperse properly. [...] These misfolded AR proteins form aggregates in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus. [...] Over the course of 30 to 50 years, these aggregates accumulate and have a cytotoxic effect, eventually resulting in the neurodegenerative symptoms associated with SBMA.|$|E
