5|$|The episode {{begins in}} an {{abandoned}} warehouse, where Dean (Ackles) is attacked by the djinn that he is hunting. He suddenly finds himself {{in a world in}} which his mother (Smith) was not killed by the demon Azazel. He and his brother Sam (Jared Padalecki) were not raised to be hunters of supernatural creatures, but are no longer close, as Dean is irresponsible, disloyal, and drinks too much in this alternate reality; when a confused Dean calls him for help, Sam thinks that he is drunk. In <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>reality,</b> Dean is dating the beautiful Carmen (Michelle Borth), and Sam is at law school and engaged to Jessica (Palicki)another victim of Azazel. Although Dean enjoys his new life, a ghostly young woman seems to be haunting him and he is confronted by an image of corpses in his closet. He realizes that all the people that he and Sam had saved as hunters are now dead, that he and Sam have a distant and somewhat adversarial relationship. After visiting the grave of his father John, who died the previous year of a stroke, Dean decides that he must give up his new-found happiness to save them.|$|E
25|$|It {{took years}} for {{business}} ownership to reflect <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>reality.</b> A survey in 1929 found that whites {{owned and operated}} 81.51% of the neighborhood's 10,319 businesses, with beauty parlors making up {{the largest number of}} black-owned businesses. By the late 1960s, 60% of the businesses in Harlem responding to surveys reported ownership by blacks, and an overwhelming fraction of new businesses were black owned after that time.|$|E
25|$|After First Jewish–Roman War in 70 CE, {{with the}} end of the Second Temple Jewish center in Jerusalem, Jewish social and legal norms were in upheaval. The Rabbis were faced with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>reality</b> of Judaism without a Temple (to serve as the center of {{teaching}} and study) and Judea without autonomy. It is during this period that Rabbinic discourse began to be recorded in writing. The possibility was felt that the details of the oral traditions of the Pharisees from the Second Temple period (530s BCE – 70 CE) would be forgotten, so the justification was found to have these oral laws transcribed.|$|E

25|$|The {{arrival of}} the Africanized honey bee in Central America is {{threatening}} the ancient art of keeping Melipona stingless bees in log gums {{even though they do}} not interbreed or directly compete with each other. The honey production from a single hive of Africanized bees can be 100kg annually and far exceeds the much smaller 3–5kg of the various Melipona stingless species. Thus economic pressures are forcing beekeepers to switch from the traditional bees of their ancestors to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>reality</b> of the Africanized honey bee. Whether this will lead to their extinction is unknown, but they are well adapted to exist in the wild, {{and there are a number}} of indigenous plants that the Africanized honey bees do not visit, so their fate remains to be seen.|$|E
25|$|When modern {{political}} parties {{were created in}} Serbia, in 1881, the Progressive Party {{turned out to be}} the only of the three Serbian parties (the other two being the mostly pro-Russian Liberal Party and very pro-Russian Radical Party) that was ready to make an agreement with Austria-Hungary, which became the most influential country in Serbia after the Congress of Berlin in 1878. The ruler decided to open a new page in Serbian foreign policy and arranged that a secret convention should be signed with the Habsburg Monarchy. Mijatović was gradually entrusted by the ruler to complete this task and on June 28, 1881 he signed the Secret Convention by which Serbia got the diplomatic and political backing of the Habsburg Empire but abandoned her independence in the field of Foreign Policy. When the two other most prominent members of the Cabinet, Prime Minister Piroćanac and Home Minister Garašanin learned about the exact contents of the Convention they decided to resign but had to accept <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>reality</b> in the end. In return Mijatović had to resign his post as Minister of Foreign Affairs and kept only his tenure at the Ministry of Finance. His last act as Minister of Foreign Affairs was to sign a Consular Convention and a Commercial Agreement with the United States of America on October 14. 1881. During talks that preceded the signing of the Secret Convention Mijatović was well received in Vienna by the Emperor Francis Joseph and other dignitaries of the Empire. The Emperor later decorated him with the first class of the Order of the Iron Crown, which entitled its bearer to become Austro-Hungarian count. Serbian citizens were banned by the Serbian constitution to accept any nobility titles. It is not clear if Mijatović ever officially submitted application to become an Austro-Hungarian count, yet he used this title openly since 1915, being the only Serb from the Kingdom of Serbia who did it.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} {{directors}} Kripke had become acquainted with and learned from was David Nutter. Kripke thus wanted to include homages to Nutter's work on the pilot; some scenes of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>reality</b> {{were meant to be}} recreations from the first episode. The crew attempted to match the camera angles, lighting, and music as much as possible. While Sam and Jessica sleeping together in bed was supposed to be an exact replica of a similar scene, the fight between the brothers differed. Because the new Sam is [...] "pretty much a wussy", Dean is able to take him down instantly. Tucker noted that it was also a [...] "sneaky way" [...] of hinting that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>reality</b> was merely an illusion, as he is [...] "re-experiencing that moment from the pilot because his fantasy world is being generated by what he already knows and has lived".|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{similarities}} between Somari and the original game, reviewers were {{quick to point out}} the many differences between them. Commentators on the Russian TV program Dendy: <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Reality</b> stated that [...] "Somari for Dendy {{is not the same as}} Sonic for SEGA. ... Everything's different." [...] Contemporary criticism of the game emphasized its difficulty relative to the original Sonic title, and the game was characterized as having complex controls (although reviews claimed that these could be mastered in time).|$|E
500|$|After these revelations, Madoka {{decides to}} become a magical girl with the wish to stop all witches in the past, present, and future before they are created. The scope of this wish rewrites history {{and the laws of}} the universe, and her {{existence}} as a human girl is erased from time. Instead, she transcends into a cosmic phenomenon called [...] "The Law of Cycles", which appears to all magical girls at the moment before they become witches and rescues them by taking them away to a heavenly paradise.

500|$|The writers {{wanted to}} use a wish to create <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>reality,</b> and chose a genie to {{facilitate}} it.

To avoid the typical portrayal of genies in popular culturesuch as those from Aladdin and I Dream of Jeanniethey chose to create a [...] "logical twist on the lore" [...] by making the creature vampiric. Tucker originally intended for the creature's feeding method to be mysticalit would inhale its victim's life essence {{from his or her}} mouth. However, Kripke preferred to style it more like a horror movie, and had the djinn feed from a shunt in its victim's neck.|$|E

500|$|Rwanda {{settled into}} <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>reality</b> of Hutu {{dominance}} after the 1960 elections; Belgium and Logiest supported PARMEHUTU, and Tutsi influence dwindled. The United Nations Trusteeship Commission, dominated by countries allied with Communist ones and favouring the anti-Belgian, Tutsi UNAR party, lobbied for independently monitored elections. The commission sponsored General Assembly resolutions 1579 and 1580, calling for elections and {{a referendum on}} the monarchy; Logiest dismissed the efforts as [...] "perfectly useless", and made little effort to implement them. A National Reconciliation Conference was held in Belgium in January 1961, which ended in failure. Logiest and Kayibanda then convened a meeting of the country's local leaders, at which a [...] "sovereign democratic Republic of Rwanda" [...] was proclaimed with Dominique Mbonyumutwa its interim president. The UN published a report that an [...] "oppressive system has been replaced by another one", but its ability to influence events had ended. PARMEHUTU won control of the legislature in September 1961; Kayibanda assumed the presidency, and Rwanda became fully independent in July 1962.|$|E
500|$|The {{final version}} of the episode {{differed}} from the original concept. It was initially intended for Dean to be a [...] "huge loser" [...] in his new life; being a hunter is what gives him structure and purpose. Without hunting, he would be a jobless barfly. Kripke compared <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>reality</b> to a Charles Bukowski novel, but noted that the selfless Dean still preferred the new universe, with Sam happy and living a good life. However, executive producer Robert Singer and others convinced him to change this, because they did not think Dean would be happy suddenly waking up in such a reality. Another variation stemmed from Dean's lack of someone to confide innormally Sam is his confidant. Because the writers found it difficult to communicate Dean's feelings, early drafts of the script included a number of internal monologues. These were ultimately replaced by a scene in which he discusses the djinn with a professor. The studio wanted the scene of Dean and his girlfriend Carmen kissing on the sofa to include sex. However, Kripke could not work it into the script, because he found it unrealistic that she would deliberately be late for her job as a hospital nurse.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Eric Kripke's first {{experience}} as director was slated for the twentieth {{episode of the}} season, and Raelle Tucker was scheduled to pen it. Kripke wanted a script that was as [...] "director-proof as possible", but that would [...] "play with structure and really do something different". He shot down every idea the writers pitched to him until Tucker suggested an alternate reality episode. Drawing inspiration from the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode [...] "Normal Again", Kripke was excited by the concept. He felt Dean's definitive moment was {{the death of his}} mother Mary, so the [...] "diversion path" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>reality</b> would be based on the question, [...] "What if mom never died?" [...] This change allows Sam and Dean to live normal lives, though at the cost of their relationship. The point of the false reality, in Kripke's opinion, was to show that the brothers would not be close if they had not become hunters. The staff tried to persuade him to remove this aspect, but {{he thought it would be}} [...] "lame" [...] for Sam and Dean to have a [...] "7th Heaven relationship". Once the story was fully developed, Tucker was given free rein over the script; this surprised her because she expected Kripke to [...] "be more of a backseat driver than he was".|$|E

500|$|In 1965, the {{influence}} of artists such as Bob Dylan, who moved beyond political protest by experimenting with abstract and surreal lyrical imagery, then switched to electric guitar, became increasingly pervasive across the musical landscape, affecting a number of genres, including garage rock. [...] The members of garage bands, like so many musicians of the 1960s, {{were part of a}} generation that was largely born into the paradigm and customs of an older time, but grew up confronting a new set of issues facing a more advanced and technological age. [...] Postwar prosperity brought the advantages of better education, was well as more spare time for recreation, which along with the new technology, made it possible for an increasing number of young people to play music. [...] With the advent of television, nuclear weapons, civil rights, the Cold War, and space exploration, the new generation was more global in its mindset and began to conceive of a higher order of human relations, attempting to reach for a set of transcendent ideals, often expressed through rock music. [...] Though set to a backdrop of tragic events that ultimately proved disillusioning, the various forms of personal and musical experimentation held promise, at least for a time, in the minds of many. [...] While testing the frontiers of what the new world had to offer, 1960s youth ultimately had to accept the limitations of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>reality,</b> yet often did so while experiencing the ecstasy of a moment when the range of possibilities seemed boundless and within reach.|$|E
