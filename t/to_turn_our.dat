But he was a first-rate contrapuntist, and his harmonic world can glow with a rare internal warmth.

500|$|Stewart himself {{says that}} he does not {{perceive}} his show as cynical. [...] "It's so interesting to me that people talk about late-night comedy being cynical," [...] he says. [...] "What's more cynical than forming an ideological news network like Fox and calling it 'fair and balanced'? What we do, I almost think, is adorable in its idealism." [...] Stewart has said {{that he does not}} take any joy in the failings of American government, despite the comedic fodder they provide. [...] "We're not the guys at the craps table betting against the line," [...] he said on Larry King Live. [...] "If government suddenly became inspiring... we would be the happiest people in the world <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> attention to idiots like, you know, media people, no offense." ...|$|E

500|$|DC Comics {{co-publisher}} Dan DiDio {{explained the}} decision by stating that [...] "e didn't want <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> back on the diversity issue, but she'll always be the most recognizable [...] We are working with concerns to diversify the line. We're always looking to re-position to be reflective of today's audience." [...] Gail Simone, who will be writing the series, stated: [...] "For many years, I got to write the character as Oracle, and there is to this day, no character who means more to me. This is classic Barbara as she was originally conceived, with a few big surprises. It’s {{a bit of a}} shock, to be sure, but we’re {{doing everything we can to}} be respectful to this character’s amazing legacy, while presenting something thrilling that a generation of comics readers will be experiencing for the first time... Barbara Gordon leaping, fighting, and swinging over Gotham. Now, when citizens of that city look up, they are going to see BATGIRL. And that is absolutely thrilling." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1963 Waldron {{had a major}} {{breakdown}} caused by a heroin overdose. He recounted in 1998 {{that a lot of}} musicians in the 1950s and 1960s felt that taking drugs was necessary for career progression. The police assumed they were all doing it, according to Waldron: The police would stop the musicians and search us as we came out of the clubs after work. We had <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> pockets inside out. After a while, the musicians thought ... well, if you have the name you might as well have the game. Eventually, I overdosed. I couldn't remember my own name. My hands were trembling, I couldn't play the piano. I needed shock treatments and a spinal tap to bring me back. [...] Waldron always felt that he had to return to playing, but this was a slow process. About a year after the overdose, his physical recovery was sufficient to allow him to start relearning his skills, which he did partly by listening to his own records. His recovery as a musician continued for another two years, as his speed of thought was still too slow over that period to allow genuine improvisation: [...] "I worked out my solos in advance and played what I had written out, until gradually all my faculties returned".|$|E
500|$|The lyrics on Riot Act {{were more}} direct than on {{preceding}} records, {{in response to}} the political climate after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Bassist Jeff Ament commented that he felt that love was a major theme of the album, and Vedder tried to convey themes such as love, loss and struggle to make a difference because of the difficulty in leading with events such as the September 11 attacks and the accidental death of nine fans during Pearl Jam's performance at the 2000 Roskilde Festival – [...] "You start feeling like, 'What do I have to say? What is my opinion?' Then I realized I did have an opinion. Not only did I have one, but I felt like it was formed by processing a lot of information and having good influences. Ament also told that [...] "I think the time's right <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> voice up a bit [...] And Ed did it in a great way, with humour and a mystical, magical approach. It isn't just, 'We're pissed off, and fuck you! Riot! Anarchy!' Cos I don't think that's the method. At least at this point." [...] Vedder, however, said, [...] "I have to admit this record came out a bit one-sided. But I think we as a country need to understand why we're involved in the Middle East. This hollow patriotism frightens me." [...] The singer added that the Riot Act lyrics [...] "represent my state of mind these days. I'm optimistic yet disillusioned, hopeful yet frustrated." [...] Several songs on the album were inspired by Roskilde tragedy, with the album's first single, [...] "I Am Mine", being written by Vedder in 2000 in a hotel room before the band's first show after Roskilde, and [...] "Love Boat Captain" [...] including a brief lyrical reference ("Lost nine friends we'll never know... two years ago today"). Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, [...] "There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Waiting for the Barbarians, {{an opera}} from J. M. Coetzee's novel (with the {{libretto}} by Christopher Hampton), had its premiere performance in September 2005. Glass defined {{the work as}} a [...] "social/political opera", as a critique on the Bush administration's war in Iraq, a [...] "dialogue about political crisis", and an illustration of the [...] "power of art <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> attention toward the human dimension of history". While the opera's themes are Imperialism, apartheid, and torture, the composer chose an understated approach by using [...] "very simple means, and the orchestration is very clear and very traditional; it's almost classical in sound", as the conductor D. Russell Davies notes.|$|E
