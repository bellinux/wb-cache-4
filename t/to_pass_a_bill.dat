5|$|Through 1935, as {{the breakup}} {{legislation}} wound through Congress, and litigation through the courts, Willkie was the industry's chief spokesman and lobbyist. When the Senate narrowly {{passed a bill}} for the breakup, Willkie {{made a series of}} speeches asking the public to oppose the legislation, and a storm of letters to congressmen followed. After the House of Representatives defeated the breakup clause, investigation proved that many of these communications were funded by the electric companies, signed with names taken from the telephone book, though Willkie was not implicated. Amid public anger, Roosevelt pressured Congress <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> requiring the breakup to take place within three years.|$|E
5|$|With {{the passage}} of the Pittman Act in 1918, the United States Mint was {{required}} to strike millions of silver dollars, and began to do so in 1921, using the Morgan dollar design. Numismatists began to lobby the Mint to issue a coin that memorialized the peace following World War I; although they failed to get Congress <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> requiring the redesign, they were able to persuade government officials to take action. The Peace dollar was approved by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon in December 1921, completing the redesign of United States coinage that had begun in 1907.|$|E
5|$|Aubame {{served as}} foreign {{minister}} under the coalition government, though in early 1963 he was {{dropped from the}} Cabinet for refusing to create a single-party Gabon. To oust Aubame from his legislative seat, M'ba appointed him President of the Supreme Court on 25 February, practically a powerless post. M'ba supporters tried <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> that declared that a member of parliament could only hold a single role in government. The president claimed that Aubame had resigned from the National Assembly, citing incompatibility with {{the functions of the}} assembly. Aubame, however, unexpectedly resigned from the Supreme Court on 10 January 1964, complicating matters for M'ba. In a fit of rage, M'ba dissolved the National Assembly on 21 January 1964. The New York Times speculates that this was due to it not supporting M'ba in Aubame's removal.|$|E
50|$|On May 11, 2006, Senate leaders {{declared}} {{that they would}} try <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> immigration <b>bill</b> of their own {{by the end of}} the month, S. 2611.|$|R
50|$|This drastic action {{prompted}} the General Assembly <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> military <b>bill</b> proposed by Governor Jackson, which reorganized the militia as the Missouri State Guard. Jackson appointed Sterling Price as {{commander of the}} Guard.|$|R
50|$|In 1894, Venstre and Estrup's Højre cooperated <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> budget <b>bill,</b> and Estrup resigned. He {{would not}} hold any future offices as minister, but {{retained}} significant {{influence in the}} following governments formed by Højre.|$|R
5|$|During World War I, Burnham {{was living}} in California and was active in counterespionage for Britain. Much of it {{involved}} a famous Boer spy, Captain Fritz Joubert Duquesne, who became a German spy in both World Wars and claimed to have killed Field Marshal Kitchener while en route {{to meet with the}} Russians. During the Second Boer War, Burnham and Duquesne were each under orders to assassinate the other, {{but it was not until}} 1910 that the two men first met while both were in Washington, D.C., separately lobbying Congress <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> in favor of the importation of African game animals into the United States (H.R. 23621). Duquesne was twice arrested by the FBI and in 1942 he and 32 other Nazi agents (the Duquesne Spy Ring) were jailed for espionage in the largest spy ring conviction in U.S. history.|$|E
25|$|On December 8, 1829, President Andrew Jackson made {{a speech}} announcing his {{intention}} <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> through Congress by the following spring requiring Indian tribes living in the Southeastern states to move west of the Mississippi.|$|E
25|$|Sir Ethelred: a Secretary of State (Home Secretary) to {{whom the}} Assistant Commissioner reports. At {{the time of the}} bombing he is busy trying <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> {{regarding}} the nationalisation of fisheries through the House of Commons against great opposition. He is briefed by the Assistant Commissioner throughout the novel whom he often admonishes not to go into detail.|$|E

5000|$|On January 30, Conger {{filed the}} {{accusation}} before the State Senate, stating that Allds had [...] "demanded, received and accepted $1,000 {{on or about}} April 23, 1901, in consideration for his failure <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> certain <b>bill</b> then pending before the Assembly." ...|$|R
5000|$|Governor J. Millard Tawes urges the Maryland General Assembly <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> {{anti-discrimination}} <b>bill</b> {{aimed at}} ending prejudice in establishments throughout the state, though {{the effort is}} hampered when Eastern Shore legislators push to allow counties to exempt themselves from enforcement of the bill.|$|R
25|$|In November 1779 The Maryland House of Delegates moved <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> confiscating the {{property}} {{of those who had}} sided with the Crown during the Revolution. Carroll opposed this measure, questioning the motives of those who pressed for confiscation and arguing that the measure was unjust. However, such moves to confiscate Tory property had much popular support and eventually, in 1780, the measure passed.|$|E
25|$|In April 2007, Ogletree {{appealed to}} the U.S. Congress <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> {{extending}} {{the statute of limitations}} for the case, given the state and city's accountability for the destruction and the long suppression of material about it. The bill was introduced by John Conyers, Jr. of Michigan and heard by the Judiciary Committee of the House but not passed. Conyers re-introduced the bill in 2009 as the John Hope Franklin Tulsa-Greenwood Race Riot Claims Accountability Act of 2009 (H.R. 1843), and in 2012. It has not gotten out of the Judiciary Committee.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Rauschenberg unsuccessfully lobbied U.S. Congress <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> that would {{compensate}} artists when {{their work is}} resold. The artist later supported a state bill in California that did become law, the California Resale Royalty Act of 1976. Rauschenberg took up his fight for artist resale royalties after the taxi baron Robert Scull sold part of his art collection in a 1973 auction, including Rauschenberg's 1958 painting Thaw that he had originally sold to Scull for $900 but brought $85,000 at an auction at Sotheby Parke Bernet in New York.|$|E
50|$|In Kosovo, {{the most}} popular TV shows in December 2012 were Fatmagül'ün Suçu Ne? (What is Fatmagül's Fault?), which ranked top of all {{programmes}} and Aşk ve Ceza (Love and Punishment), which came in third according to data by Index Kosova. In Serbia, research from January 2013 indicates that the top two Turkish shows in TV were Muhteşem Yüzyıl, which ranked fourth, and Öyle Bir Geçer Zaman Ki (As Time Goes By), which came in seventh. Fatmagul was one of {{the most popular}} shows in Macedonia which irked the government <b>to</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> restrict broadcasts of Turkish series during the day and at prime time in order to reduce the Turkish impact on Macedonian society.|$|R
5000|$|Citing the {{cultural}} and economic benefits of nightlife, Wiener introduced SB 384 to allow cities to extend alcohol sales in bars and restaurants to 4 AM. [...] Senator Mark Leno, Wiener’s predecessor, had attempted <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> similar <b>bill.</b> SB 384 passed the Senate with bipartisan support.|$|R
5000|$|Oregon's bottle bill {{inspired}} similar laws {{in eight}} other states between 1972 and 1983. California activists attempted <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> bottle <b>bill</b> {{beginning in the}} late 1970s but were blocked by recycling organizations. <b>A</b> modified <b>bill</b> <b>passed</b> in 1986. [...] In 1991, Germany enacted an entirely different method which taxes manufacturers {{on the basis of the}} amount of packaging.|$|R
25|$|In 1951, Daley {{succeeded in}} getting the state senate <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> calling for a Chicago campus. Daley became mayor of Chicago in 1955 and pressed the University of Illinois to upgrade the Chicago Undergraduate Center to a {{full-fledged}} four-year institution. After a long and controversial site decision process, in 1961, Mayor Daley offered the Harrison and Halsted Streets site for the new campus. In December 1961, the final decision to establish a four-year university in Chicago was made. In that same year, the Chicago Professional Colleges became the University of Illinois at the Medical Center (UIMC). In 1963, construction began on the University's new Chicago campus at Harrison and Halsted Streets.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} two years Berry clung to office while the colony was gripped with class conflict, {{including}} huge torchlit processions through Melbourne sponsored by The Age (pro-Berry) and The Argus (anti-Berry) - although, remarkably, there was almost no violence. Almost no legislation was passed and the administration ground to a halt as funds ran out. Berry's next tactic was <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> through the Assembly stating that finance bills {{did not need to be}} passed by the Council, but would become law when passed by the Assembly. Bowen thought this bill unconstitutional, but signed it on Berry's advice. When the Colonial Office learned of this, Bowen was recalled and the bill overturned.|$|E
25|$|In early April 2009, the Georgia General Assembly {{created a}} budget crisis for MARTA by failing <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> {{that would allow}} it to access its own capital reserve account, in order to {{compensate}} for a severe drop in sales-tax revenue during the late-2000s recession. MARTA stated that this could force the agency to discontinue operations one day out of the week, possibly a weekday. The agency's budget crisis forced MARTA to lay off 700 employees. Service cuts and other budget-stabilizing measures began in fiscal year 2011, with the first affected service mark-up in September 2010. Governor Sonny Perdue refused to call a special session as requested, and did not issue an executive order as he stated {{it would not be}} legal to do so.|$|E
50|$|During its brief existence, Girard's {{ministry}} promoted fiscal {{restraint and}} an effective system of auditing public accounts, also advocating {{the abolition of}} the unelected Legislative Council. It also managed <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> redistribution <b>bill</b> which allowed for 14 ridings with an English-speaking majority and 10 ridings with a French-speaking majority. Most considered this to be a fair compromise.|$|R
50|$|The {{election}} is notable in that no redistricting occurred despite {{the completion of}} the 1920 United States Census, as Congress failed <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> redistricting <b>bill.</b> This was the first and only election in which there was no redistricting after a census. The Apportionment Act of 1911 remained in effect until the Reapportionment Act of 1929.|$|R
50|$|The {{legislature}} met in {{a regular}} session from January 3, 1989, to May 22, 1989. A special session was convened from September 27, 1989, to September 29, 1989, <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> tax <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> replace the one which was vetoed by Governor Rudy Perpich, {{as well as to}} consider property tax relief and the statewide solid waste recycling program.|$|R
25|$|Oberstar {{was given}} a rating of 100 by the Environment America and the League of Conservation Voters in 2009. The American Wind Energy Association also gave him a rating of 100 in 2006. He voted to pass the Energy and Environmental Law Amendments which had the goal of {{establishing}} a program to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in 2009. He also voted <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill,</b> Trade-in Vouchers for Fuel-Efficient Cars, in 2009 which granted a $3,500 voucher, or document that could be exchanged for services {{in the place of}} money, for trading in an old vehicle with at least 4 miles per gallon more, the purpose of which was to increase the purchasing of fuel efficient cars. However, Oberstar went against most Democrats and voted in favor of allowing drilling in ANWR.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} attracted little notice at the time. Two years later, {{the possibilities}} it opened up became clearer when Citibank, squeezed by interest rate caps, {{decided to move}} its credit-card operations out of New York City. The company persuaded Bill Janklow, then governor of South Dakota, whose agricultural economy was struggling at the time due to high fuel prices, to persuade that state's legislature to formally invite the bank there, as required by federal law before a national bank can do business from a state. He then successfully lobbied the legislators <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> drafted by the bank that repealed the state's cap on interest rates, something {{a small group of}} legislators were already trying to do. Citibank quickly moved the 300 white-collar jobs in its credit-card division to Sioux Falls, where it has been ever since.|$|E
25|$|Sewall became {{involved}} in the state fight for women's right to vote in 1880, when the Indianapolis suffragists lobbied the Indiana General Assembly <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> that would give Indiana women the right to vote on an equal basis with men. The suffrage supporters, including Sewall, were successful in getting the Indiana Senate and the Indiana House of Representatives to adopt a suffrage amendment to the state constitution in 1881, but state law required amendments to the state constitution to be passage at two consecutive legislative sessions. Indiana's suffrage groups worked statewide to secure passage of the amendment in the 1883 legislative session. The House resolution passed on February 20, 1883, but the Senate refused to act on it. Frustrated with the Indiana legislature's failure to amend the state constitution, Sewall turned her efforts to securing voting rights for women at the national level.|$|E
50|$|Both Appropriation and Imprest Supply bills {{fall under}} the rubric of {{confidence}} and supply. A refusal by the House <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> such <b>a</b> <b>Bill</b> conventionally leads to either the resignation of the Government (unlikely, since there is usually no alternative Government immediately available) or to a dissolution of the House and a subsequent general election.|$|R
5000|$|Among {{the states}} in the US <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> such <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> was Georgia, whose State Bill 440 {{attempted}} [...] "to provide that certain juvenile offenders who commit certain violent felonies shall be tried as adults in the superior court." [...] However, in 2009, <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> softened the effects of that law, regressing from the default to try violent minor offenders as adults.|$|R
5000|$|The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (also {{known as}} [...] "Obamacare" [...] or the ACA) {{elicited}} major {{opposition from the}} Republican Party from its inception, and Trump called for a repeal of the law during the 2016 election campaign. On taking office, Trump promised <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> healthcare <b>bill</b> {{that would result in}} better and less expensive insurance that would cover everyone.|$|R
500|$|During the 113th United States Congress, {{both the}} United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives voted <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> that would award the Congressional Gold Medal to the World War II {{members of the}} Civil Air Patrol.

500|$|As {{chairman}} of the International Narcotics Control Caucus, Biden wrote the laws that created the U.S. [...] "Drug Czar", who oversees and coordinates national drug control policy. In April 2003, he introduced the controversial Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act, {{also known as the}} RAVE Act. He continued to work {{to stop the spread of}} [...] "date rape drugs" [...] such as flunitrazepam, and drugs such as Ecstasy and Ketamine. In 2004, he worked <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> outlawing steroids like androstenedione, the drug used by many baseball players.|$|E
500|$|The {{omission}} of the motto [...] "In God We Trust" [...] {{on the new}} coins caused public outrage, and prompted Congress <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> mandating its inclusion. [...] Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber added the words and made minor modifications to the design. [...] The Indian Head eagle was struck regularly until 1916, and then intermittently until President Franklin Roosevelt directed the Mint to stop producing gold coins in 1933. [...] Its termination ended the series of eagles struck for circulation begun in 1795. [...] Many Indian Head eagles were melted {{by the government in}} the late 1930s; the 1933 issue is a particular rarity, as few were distributed.|$|E
25|$|In 1874, Piper {{represented}} Storey County in the Nevada Senate. In {{an effort}} {{to raise money for}} Storey County to pay for railroad bonds, Piper managed to get the state senate <b>to</b> unanimously <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> that became law, removing the taxation limits on bullion in the county. Piper ran a chain of venues to accommodate touring companies. Among these were McKissick's Opera House in Reno and the Carson Opera House in Carson City.|$|R
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1985, Ohio Citizen Action and other groups across the country {{delivered}} {{more than a million}} petition signatures urging Congress <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>bill.</b> The measure <b>passed</b> by <b>a</b> one-vote margin, and included an important new component, the requirement that industries report the chemicals being used and stored at their facilities, and their emissions into the air, land, and water. That was the birth, in 1986, of the Toxics Release Inventory.|$|R
50|$|The MGP and {{politicians}} in Maharashtra were elated at the victory and touted it as a mandate {{that the majority}} of Goans were in favour of merger. Dayanand Bandodkar, the leader of MGP and the first Chief Minister of Goa, proclaimed that by voting the MGP into power, the people of Goa had, in effect, voted in favour of merger with Maharashtra. According <b>to</b> them, <b>passing</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> in the state legislature was all that was needed. <b>Passing</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> in the assembly would be easy for the MGP as they had a simple majority.|$|R
