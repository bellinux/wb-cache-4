5|$|Among the reds, Grenache, Syrah, Carignan, Cinsault, and Mourvedre {{are major}} grapes of the Corbières, Faugères, Fitou, and Minervois AOCs. Cinsault is also {{commonly}} used in rosé production along with Lladoner Pelut, Picpoul noir, <b>Terret</b> noir, and Grenache. Grenache is also the main grape used in the fortified wines of the Banyuls and Rivesaltes region. Some of the oldest vines in France are Carignan grapes. Winemakers often use carbonic maceration to soften the tannins.|$|E

25|$|After excavation, more finds {{included}} a bronze brooch and <b>terret</b> ring. The wider {{implications of the}} excavation were that {{it was discovered that}} occupation of the area had passed through five phases from the 1st to 4th century of the Romano-British empire.|$|E

50|$|The lines {{run from}} the hands of the driver, through the <b>terrets,</b> and then attach to the horse's bit to guide the horse. Most harnesss have two pairs of <b>terrets,</b> one on the harness saddle, and one on the hames of the collar (or on the neck-strap of a breast collar). <b>Terrets</b> are {{commonly}} made of brass or steel, and they may stand up stiffly, or they may consist of a hinged ring.

500|$|By {{the time}} of Julius Caesar's {{attempted}} invasion of Britain in 55BC, the inhabitants of Britain included proficient horsemen. Caesar's forces were met by British horsemen and war chariots, the chariots outfighting the Gaulish horsemen who had accompanied him. Caesar later faced organised resistance led by Cassivellaunus, with over 4,000war chariots. To {{the east of the}} Pennines, the Romans also encountered the Gabrantovici, or [...] "horse-riding warriors." [...] The spread and development of horse trappings recovered from this period, such as bits, strap junctions and <b>terrets,</b> have been used to indicate the withdrawal of ruling groups of Britons during the Roman conquest of Britain.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Terret</b> is {{an ancient}} Vitis vinifera vine that, like the parent Pinot vine of Pinot noir's history, mutated {{over the course of}} {{thousands}} of years into grape varieties of several color. Originating in the Languedoc-Roussillon wine of southern France, the descendents of <b>Terret</b> now include the red wine variety <b>Terret</b> noir, the white <b>Terret</b> blanc and the light-skinned <b>Terret</b> gris.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Terret</b> noir is a dark-skinned French {{wine grape}} variety grown {{primarily}} in the Rhône valley region of France. It is a mutation of the old Vitis vinifera vine <b>Terret.</b> [...] It is a permitted blending grape for Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Like the related <b>Terret</b> gris and <b>Terret</b> blanc, the vine tends to bud late and grow vigorously. <b>Terret</b> noir produces a light color wine that is perfumed and tart.|$|E
60|$|Mark {{how things}} happen! If Platte's sais {{had put the}} new saddle-pad on the mare, the butts of the <b>terrets</b> would not have worked through the worn leather, and the old pad into the mare's withers, when she was coming home at {{two o'clock in the}} morning. She would not have reared, bolted, fallen into a ditch, upset the cart, and sent Platte flying over an aloe-hedge on to Mrs. Larkyn's well-kept lawn; and this tale would never have been written. But the mare did all these things, and while Platte was rolling over and over on the turf, like a shot rabbit, the watch and guard flew from his waistcoat--as an Infantry Major's sword hops out of the {{scabbard}} when they are firing a feu de joie--and rolled and rolled in the moonlight, till it stopped under a window.|$|R
5000|$|The harness saddle has {{at least}} two lines of evolution, both departures from the very ancient throat-and-girth harness [...] One line was {{developed}} as a refinement of that harness and involved {{a wide variety of}} martingale and breastplate type straps in front of the shoulder and between the forelegs, all attached to a saddle and girth. This line is documented in Byzantium in the 10th century and Khmer in the 12th century, and occurs today in Japanese plough harnesses and Indian tongas. The other line, far more successful, evolved in China from ancient withers-straps that originally were used with a breastplate-and-breeching harness without a girth. This was the Han departure from the throat-and-girth harness. A minority of 2nd century Han art shows this new breastplate-and-breeching harness with a girth added to it, and in that context ancient Chinese texts sometimes refer to the withers-strap as a saddle. This 2nd century harness saddle supported one of two arches attached to shafts, and had <b>terrets</b> through which the reins were carried. The other arch resembles the shaft bow that is in use today in Finland and Russia.|$|R
5000|$|The more {{decorative}} late Iron Age finds include gold torcs from Ulceby, bronze <b>terrets</b> from Owmby and Whaplode, {{a bronze}} ornament from Dragonby, a strap link from Caythorpe and a sword and scabbard from the River Witham. Parts {{of a war}} horn were {{also found in the}} Witham, but were melted down in the 18th century. There was an [...] "extensive" [...] Iron Age settlement at Old Sleaford, where over 3,500 fragments of coin moulds have been discovered, the largest such find in Europe; {{it may have been a}} tribal centre, but never became a walled town under Roman rule. The Ancaster-Sleaford region has a high concentration of settlement, which may be due to geographical factors and the presence of two north-south communication lines, Mareham Lane and Jurassic Way. Similarly, the northern Wolds were more densely inhabited; settlements at Kirmington and Dragonby have been excavated, while North Ferriby was a crossing on the Humber connected to the south by High Street. The earliest coinage in Lincolnshire were gold copies of Gallo-Belgic types, but the distinctive South Ferriby type emerged as the dominant pattern in East Midlands and silver coins became much more common from the 2nd century BC.|$|R

In official statistics, the plantings of two [...] "light-berried" [...] <b>Terret</b> grapes (as distinguished from <b>Terret</b> noir, one of the permitted blending grapes for Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC) are often counted together.
