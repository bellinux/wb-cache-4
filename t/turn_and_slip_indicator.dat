50|$|Instruments, {{either the}} <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> <b>indicator</b> or the turn coordinator, have the {{standard}} rate or half standard rate turn clearly marked. Slower aircraft {{are equipped with}} 2-minute turn indicators while faster aircraft are often equipped with 4-minute turn indicators.|$|E
50|$|The <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> <b>indicator</b> can be {{referred}} to as the turn and bank indicator, although the instrument does not respond directly to bank angle. Neither does the turn coordinator, but it does respond to roll rate, which enables it to respond more quickly to the start of a turn.|$|E

5000|$|... 14:00 - {{the outside}} {{panel of the}} pilot's L-4 window shattered. The heat in the cockpit was {{unbearable}} at this time and had cracked the glass case for the ball on both pilot's <b>and</b> co-pilot's <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> <b>indicators.</b> It is estimated that the upper compartment heat level ranged from 125-160 degrees F or higher during this period. A {{decision was made to}} depressurize the aircraft and attempt to continue the mission. Altitude was 33,500 feet.|$|R
60|$|Willy <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>slipped</b> {{back into}} her room. Then, after sitting down upon her bed and getting up again, she stepped boldly {{to the door and}} knocked upon it. Instantly she heard Miss Barbara start and push back her chair.|$|R
50|$|A {{blind flying}} panel is a sub-panel {{in the cockpit}} {{containing}} six instruments mounted away from the main panel on three rubber suspension points. All the instruments on the blind flying panel are vacuum powered from a vacuum pump fitted {{on one of the}} engines, making the instruments independent of the electrical supply. It incorporates the following pitot/static and vacuum operated instruments:- Airspeed indicator, altimeter, climb/descent indicator, artificial horizon, <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> <b>indicator</b> and a directional gyro.|$|E
50|$|Standardized turn {{rates are}} often {{employed}} in approaches and holding patterns {{to provide a}} reference for controllers and pilots so that each will know what the other is expecting. The pilot banks the airplane such that the <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> <b>indicator</b> points to the mark appropriate for that aircraft and then uses a clock to time the turn. The pilot can roll out at any desired direction depending {{on the length of}} time in the turn.|$|E
5000|$|The turn {{coordinator}} (TC) is {{a further}} development of the <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> <b>indicator</b> (T/S) with the major difference being the display and the axis upon which the gimbal is mounted. The display {{is that of a}} miniature airplane as seen from behind. This looks similar to that of an attitude indicator. [...] "NO PITCH INFORMATION" [...] is usually written on the instrument to avoid confusion regarding the aircraft's pitch, which can be obtained from the artificial horizon instrument.|$|E
60|$|Then she <b>turned</b> <b>and,</b> <b>slipping</b> by him swiftly, {{moved across}} the lawn toward the house, while Jimmy stood where he was, exultant, but realizing that the {{struggle}} before them would tax all the courage that was in him and the girl.|$|R
50|$|In {{good weather}} a pilot can fly by {{looking out the}} window. However, when flying in cloud or at night at least one {{gyroscopic}} instrument is necessary to orientate the aircraft, being either an artificial horizon, <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>slip,</b> or a gyro compass.|$|R
50|$|The GRS {{system uses}} {{solid-state}} sensors to measure aircraft attitude, rate of <b>turn,</b> <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> <b>and</b> skid. This data is then provided {{to all the}} integrated avionics units and GDU display units. Unlike many competing systems, the AHRS can be rebooted and recalibrated in flight during turns of up to 20 degrees.|$|R
5000|$|Reid and Sigrist Ltd {{was formed}} in February 1928 as a private company with Â£4000 capital. The company {{was set up by}} Squadron-Leader (ret.) George Hancock Reid DFC and Frederick Sigrist, a joint {{managing}} director of H.G. Hawker Engineering Ltd, that would later become Hawker Siddeley Aircraft Ltd. The new company acquired the rights to the designs of Reid's previous company, Reid Manufacturing & Construction Company Ltd, which had designed and made precision aircraft instrumentation, most notably an aircraft <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> <b>indicator,</b> that Reid had invented and developed, and a pilot testing apparatus.|$|E
50|$|In aviation, the <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> <b>indicator</b> (T/S, a.k.a. {{turn and}} bank indicator) and the turn {{coordinator}} (TC) variant are essentially two aircraft flight instruments in one device. One indicates {{the rate of}} turn, or {{the rate of change}} in the aircraft's heading, the other part indicates whether the aircraft is in coordinated flight, showing the slip or skid of the turn. The slip indicator is actually an inclinometer that at rest displays the angle of the aircraft's lateral axis with respect to horizontal, and in motion displays this angle as modified by the acceleration of the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Initially {{the main}} {{business}} {{focus for the}} company was the development and manufacture of aircraft instrumentation. An important product was a type of gyroscopic <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> <b>indicator</b> invented and developed by George Reid. A later version of this device was incorporated into the standard blind-flying panel adopted by the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1937. A further development was the Gyorizon which combined the functions of a turn indicator and artificial horizon in one instrument. The design and manufacture of gyroscopic instrumentation and guidance systems continued after World War II and Reid and Sigrist 3-axis gyroscopes were used in the, RAE designed, guidance system for the Black Knight rocket.|$|E
60|$|As I gazed ruefully at {{the back}} of her haughty, royal head a gate at the {{opposite}} end of the garden opened and a man entered. As he did so he <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>slipped</b> something into the hand of the yellow guardsman beyond the gate, nor was the distance too great that I might not see that money had passed between them.|$|R
25|$|One {{week later}} Trout {{launched}} two torpedoes {{at what she}} {{thought to be a}} tanker as it emerged from a rain squall. The first torpedo blew off the target's bow but the second was a dud. As the enemy ship was still steaming at eight knots, the submarine surfaced for battle with her deck guns. Trout opened fire, but soon seven of her men were wounded by enemy machine gun fire. She then swung around and fired a stern torpedo and watched Hirotama Maru turn her stern straight up with her screws still <b>turning</b> <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> under the waves. The patrol ended when the submarine returned to Fremantle on 25 February 1943.|$|R
60|$|The {{creature}} addressed <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>slipped</b> {{through the}} doorway, {{closing the door}} after it, but first depositing its curved blade upon the floor without. Its post was immediately taken by another and Bradley now saw that at least twenty such guards loitered in the immediate vicinity. The doorkeeper was gone but for a moment, and when he returned, he signified that Bradley's party was to enter the next chamber; but first each of the Wieroos removed his curved weapon and laid it upon the floor. The door was swung open, and the party, now reduced to Bradley and five Wieroos, was ushered across the threshold into a large, irregularly shaped room in which a single, giant Wieroo whose robe was solid blue sat upon a raised dais.|$|R
60|$|It {{was long}} past midnight when Captain Byrne {{was rewarded with}} success--the {{tumblers}} clicked into position, {{the handle of the}} safe door <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> the bolts <b>slipped</b> back.|$|R
60|$|She lit a {{lamp and}} dressed herself noiselessly, but with feverish haste. Then she listened. The house was very still. Amelia and John {{had gone to}} bed. She wrapped herself in a heavy woollen shawl hanging {{in the hall and}} crept downstairs. With numbed fingers she fumbled at the key of the hall door, <b>turned</b> it <b>and</b> <b>slipped</b> out into the night.|$|R
60|$|Butzow saluted and the Princess Emma curtsied, as {{the king}} <b>turned</b> <b>and,</b> <b>slipping</b> his arm through that of Prince Ludwig, walked {{away in the}} {{direction}} of the royal apartments. Once at the king's desk Barney turned toward the chancellor. In his mind was the determination to save Lutha if Lutha could be saved. He had been forced to place the king in a position where he would be helpless, though that he would have been equally as helpless upon his throne the American did not doubt for an instant. However, the course of events had placed within his hands the power to serve not only Lutha but the house of Von der Tann as well. He would do in the king's place what the king should have done if the king had been a man.|$|R
6000|$|He {{knew that}} she had seen <b>and</b> <b>turning,</b> <b>slipped</b> away into the {{darkness}} back to the gate. As he went he heard the knight called Lord Charles, exclaim: ...|$|R
50|$|Yaw {{refers to}} the {{direction}} in which the nose of the aircraft is pointing. It is the left-right movement of the nose across the horizon. It is possible for the nose of the aircraft to be pointing in a different direction from that in which the aircraft is moving. This usually occurs in a <b>turn,</b> <b>and</b> is called <b>slip</b> (if the aircraft is moving sideways into the turn) or skid (if it is moving outwards). Yaw is almost impossible to detect by visual references. In fixed-wing aircraft it is detected by references to the <b>slip</b> <b>indicator.</b> Gliders usually have a piece of string mounted in the pilot's vision which indicates airflow over the glider, and is called the yaw string.|$|R
60|$|Walking through San Mateo, Carl {{swung his}} cocky green hat {{and scanned the}} sky for aircraft. He saw none. But as he tramped out on the flying-field he began to run {{at the sight of}} two wide, {{cambered}} wings, rounded at the ends like the end of one's thumb, attached to a fragile long body of open framework. Men were gathered about it. A man with a short, crisp beard and a tight woolen toboggan-cap was seated in the body, the wings stretching on either side of him. He scratched his beard and gesticulated. A mechanic revolved the propeller, and the unmuffled motor burst out with a trrrrrrrr whose music rocked Carl's heart. Black smoke hurled back along the machine. The draught tore at the hair of two men crouched on the ground holding the tail. They let go. The monoplane ran forward along the ground, and suddenly was off it, a foot up, ten feet up--really flying. Carl could see the aviator calmly staring ahead, working his arms, as the machine <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>slipped</b> away over distant trees.|$|R
60|$|The hills were {{reached at}} last, {{and the whole}} party was safe--as far, at least, as the flood was concerned--but a terrible {{prospect}} lay before them. The farm of Mount Hope was by that time a sea of tumultuous water, which seemed {{in the darkness of}} the night to be sweeping away and tearing up trees, bushes, and houses. Behind and around them were the hills, whose every crevice and hollow was converted into a wild watercourse. Above was the black sky, pouring down torrents of rain incessantly, so that the very ground seemed to be <b>turning</b> into mud, <b>and</b> <b>slipping</b> away from beneath their feet. Fortunately there was no wind.|$|R
40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: Aviemore Dam was {{constructed}} across the Waitaki River valley in the mid- 1960 s. The dam straddles the steeply WSW-dipping Waitangi Fault. At {{the time of}} construction, no evidence of late Quaternary movement was documented on the fault. However, in the mid 1990 s, dam safety review investigations unearthed evidence of late Quaternary deformation, and {{this led to the}} detailed paleoseismological investigations that are summarized here. The investigations documented two, and possibly three, surface rupture fault movements on the Waitangi Fault in the last c. 23, 000 years, with the most recent movement between 13, 100 and 14, 100 years ago. These ruptures were located up to 10 m west of the bedrock fault that juxtaposes Mesozoic- and Tertiary-age rocks (respectively east and west of the fault), and had single-event vertical separations in the range of 0. 5 m to 2. 0 m. Slickenside-lineations, <b>and</b> other <b>slip</b> <b>indicators,</b> show oblique right-lateral â reverse movement along the fault in the late Quaternary with horizontal (H) to vertical (V) ratios of displacement in the range of 1 H: 3 V to 1 H: 1 V, suggesting net single-event surface-rupture displacements in the range of 0. 53 m to 2. 9 m. In addition, a zone of âsmall-scale â late Quaternary faults and folds extends up to at least 150 m west of the Waitangi Fault. The fault displacement characterisations documented here were subsequently used to derive earthquake performance assessments for the dam, and to evaluate dam safety under direct fault rupture loadings. ...|$|R
6000|$|Hugh {{caught his}} foot in a willow root and fell. Eve and Grey Dick sped onward unknowing. They reached the point above the water, <b>turned,</b> <b>and</b> saw. Dick <b>slipped</b> his bow from its case, strung it, and set an arrow on the string. Hugh had gained his feet, but {{a man who had}} come up sprang, and cast his arms about him. Hugh threw him to the ground, for he was very strong, and shook himself free. Then he drew the short and heavy sword that he wore, and, {{shouting}} out, [...] "Make way!" [...] to those who stood between him and the little promontory, started to run again.|$|R
40|$|Background: Slips are {{a common}} cause of falls, and nonslip socks have been marketed to prevent slips in older people. However, few studies have {{investigated}} the biomechanical and clinical effects of walking in nonslip socks. This study aimed to examine gait parameters in older people walking on a slippery surface wearing nonslip socks compared with standard sock and barefoot conditions. Methods: Fifteen older people completed five trials of the fast-paced Timed Up and Go test while barefoot and while wearing standard socks and nonslip socks. Kinematic data (step length, heel horizontal velocity at heel strike, and foot-floor angle at heel strike) and clinical data (total Timed Up and Go test time, total number of steps, number of steps in <b>turn,</b> <b>and</b> observed <b>slips,</b> trips, or falls) were collected. Results: Performance on the Timed Up and Go test did not differ between the barefoot and nonslip sock conditions; however, participants walked more slowly and took shorter steps when wearing standard socks. Participants rated nonslip socks to feel less slippery than barefoot and standard socks. Conclusions: Compared with wearing standard socks, wearing nonslip socks improve...|$|R
50|$|The Hanuman offers full dual controls, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the main pilot seat having brakes and flap controls. Instrumentation consists of a tachometer, airspeed <b>indicator,</b> altimeter, <b>slip</b> <b>indicator,</b> battery charge indicator & coolant temperature or CHT, GPS etc.|$|R
60|$|While {{they were}} tussling at the bench, {{dragging}} it first {{here and then}} there {{in the trial of}} strength, Trot opened the door of the palace and walked in. It was pretty dark in the hall, and only a few dim blue lights showed at intervals down the long corridors. As the girl walked through these passages, she could hear snores of various degrees coming from behind some of the closed doors and knew that all the regular inmates of the place were sound asleep. So she mounted to the upper floor, and thinking she would be likely to find Cap'n Bill in the Room of the Great Knife, she went there and tried the door. It was locked, but the key had been left on the outside. She waited until the sentry who was pacing the corridor had his back toward her, <b>and</b> then she <b>turned</b> the key <b>and</b> <b>slipped</b> within, softly closing the door behind her.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} Elsa's face <b>turned</b> grave, <b>and</b> Adrian saw her {{glance at the}} animal she had been riding <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> her arm through its rein.|$|R
60|$|Arnold murmured a {{few words}} of excuse <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> away. Mr. Tidey Junior {{carefully}} arranged his necktie <b>and</b> <b>slipped</b> down from his stool.|$|R
60|$|Sobered, shamed, the Belfords {{fell back}} <b>and</b> <b>slipped</b> out while Agnes <b>turned</b> to Edwin <b>and</b> wiped {{the blood from}} his face with {{self-contained}} tenderness.|$|R
60|$|At this, the youth, who had donned {{his clothes}} and taken up his staff again, bowed without a word, then, taking the gloves and the ring, and {{thrusting}} the one into his girdle <b>and</b> <b>slipping</b> the other upon his thumb, he <b>turned</b> <b>and,</b> leaping lightly over the ropes again, made {{his way through the}} crowd, and was gone.|$|R
5000|$|All {{seemed to}} be going well, but {{in the early morning hours}} of the fourth day, however, a hundred armed zambuks and paraus swarm into the harbor from the nearby {{channels}} and quickly surround the Flor de la Mar. [...] The Flors high sides do not allow the Portuguese to respond with artillery - the ships cannons are mounted too high and the paraus are too close for an angle of shot, so the crew turns desperately to crossbows, musket fire and heaving rocks to keep them at bay. Days before the encounter, Gama had captured a large parau, which was now tied to the stern of the Flor. In the heat of the fighting, Malabari sappers row up to the tied parau, fill it with tinder, set it afire, and direct the flaming ship towards the Flor. Gama immediately orders the cables cut and the flames of the drifting parau only just miss them. Throughout all this, some of the Portuguese sailors are desperately trying to cut the cables on the anchor - a process that took time, as Gama had ordered it down with an iron chain. But eventually the anchor is cut, and the Flor begins to sail away. As distance is gained from the zambuks and paraus, the ships cannons can now come into play and fire on the pursuers. The Flor reaches the mouth of the harbor just as Vicente SodrÃ© arrives back from Cannanore with three caravels. Seeing the ambush is foiled, the Calicut boats <b>turn</b> around <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> back into the side-channels of the harbor.|$|R
5000|$|The black color {{effect was}} {{achieved}} by means of changing the amount of oxygen present during firing. This was done in {{a process known as}} three-phase firing and was likely accomplished with multiple firings of the pottery. First, the kiln was heated to around 920-950 Â°C, with all vents open bringing oxygen into the firing chamber <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> both pot <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> a reddish-brown (oxidising conditions) due to the formation of hematite (Fe2O3) in both the paint and the clay body. Then the vent was closed and green wood introduced, creating carbon monoxide which turns the red hematite to black magnetite (Fe3O4); at this stage the temperature decreases due to incomplete combustion. In a final reoxidizing phase (at about 800-850 Â°C) the kiln was opened and oxygen reintroduced causing the unslipped reserved clay to go back to orange-red.In the previous phase, chemical composition of the slipped surface had been altered, so it could no longer be oxidized and remained black. The technique which is mostly known as the [...] "iron reduction technique" [...] was decoded with the contribution of scholars, ceramists and scientists since the mid 18th century onwards to the end of 20th century, i.e. Comte de Caylus (1752), Durand-Greville (1891), Binns and Fraser (1925), Schumann (1942), Winter (1959), Bimson (1956), Noble (1960, 1965), Hofmann (1962), Oberlies (1968), Pavicevic (1974), Aloupi (1993), Walton (2009), Walton (2014).|$|R
