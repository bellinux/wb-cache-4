40|$|Mixtures offer {{potential}} advantages over pure compounds as working fluids in ocean <b>thermal</b> energy <b>conversion</b> cycles. Power plant capital costs {{per unit of}} energy output can be reduced using mixtures because of increased thermal efficiency and/or decreased heat exchanger size requirements. Mixtures also potentially offer the advantage of improved performance characteristics under conditions of progressive fouling of heat exchangers. Potentially, {{a significant portion of}} the world's future energy needs can be supplied by ocean thermal energy (1). In ocean <b>thermal</b> energy <b>conversion</b> schemes, the objective is to utilize the 30 to 40 F temperature differences between warm surface sea water and cold (1000 to 2000 feet deep) sea water which occur in numerous regions in the oceans. The utilization of these ocean temperature differences for power generation was proposed before 1900 by D'Arsonval (1). An open steam cycle for ocean <b>thermal</b> energy <b>conversion</b> was proven technically but not economically feasible in 1926 by Claude (1). Currently, the closed cycle proposed by Anderson and Anderson (2) is being given major consideration for ocean thermal cycles, partly owing to the fact that use of working fluids such as propane or ammonia leads to small turbine sizes relative to turbine sizes for the open steam cycle. Noteworthy conceptual designs for ocean <b>thermal</b> energy <b>conversion</b> plants have been proposed by Heronemus et al. (3) and Zener (4).
