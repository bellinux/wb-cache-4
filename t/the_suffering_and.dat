5|$|Since many Soviet {{soldiers}} had lost {{family and friends}} during the German invasion and partial occupation of the USSR (about 17 million Soviet civilians plus 10 million Soviet soldiers died in World War II, more {{than in any other}} country), many felt a desire for vengeance. Murders of Axis prisoners of war and German civilians are known from cases at Soviet military tribunals. Also, when Soviet troops moved into East Prussia, large numbers of enslaved Ostarbeiter ("Eastern workers") were freed, and knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>and</b> deaths of many of these workers hardened the attitude of many Soviet soldiers towards East Prussians.|$|E

Miaoshan, {{realising}} the fate that the executioner would meet at her father's hand should she fail to let herself die, forgave the executioner for attempting to kill her. It is said that she voluntarily took on the massive karmic guilt the executioner generated for killing her, thus leaving him guiltless. It is because of this that she descended into the Hell-like realms. While there, she witnessed first-hand <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>and</b> horrors that the beings there must endure, and was overwhelmed with grief. Filled with compassion, she released all the good karma she had accumulated through her many lifetimes, thus freeing many suffering souls back into Heaven and Earth. In the process, that Hell-like realm became a paradise. It is said that Yama, the ruler of hell, sent her back to Earth to prevent the utter destruction of his realm, and that upon her return she appeared on Fragrant Mountain.|$|E

500|$|That {{is not to}} say his operas did {{not come}} as great innovations. What sounds to a modern {{listener}} as derivative of the bel canto, his first major success, Nabucco, came as a something entirely new. Never before had opera been so harmonically complex and direct. No longer was there the empty vocal display of the bel canto period composers. Granted, there is a significant amount of vocal fireworks, but they exist for the purpose of drama, not to show off singers. Aside from this, his use of the chorus was entirely new. Before Nabucco, an opera's chorus was limited to be only a background voice, another instrument. In Nabucco, this is abolished; he uses the chorus as character, to show <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>and</b> consensus of the people. The famous [...] "Va, pensiero" [...] is an example of this.|$|E

His sole possessions were a kamandalu (water pot), staff and his two favourite books: the Bhagavad Geeta and The Imitation of Christ. Narendra travelled extensively in India for five years, visiting centres of learning and acquainting himself with diverse religious traditions and social patterns. He developed sympathy for <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>and</b> poverty of the people, and resolved to uplift the nation. Living primarily on bhiksha (alms), Narendra travelled on foot and by railway (with tickets bought by admirers). During his travels he met, and stayed with Indians from all religions and walks of life: scholars, dewans, rajas, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, paraiyars (low-caste workers) and government officials. Narendra left Bombay for Chicago on 31 May 1893 with the name [...] "Vivekananda", as suggested by Ajit Singh of Khetri, which means [...] "the bliss of discerning wisdom".|$|E

500|$|As the war intensified, the Achebe {{family was}} forced to leave Enugu for the Biafran capital of Aba. As the turmoil closed in, he {{continued}} to write, but most of his creative work during the war took the form of poetry. The shorter format was a consequence of living in a war zone. [...] "I can write poetry," [...] he said, [...] "something short, intense more in keeping with my mood... All this is creating in the context of our struggle." [...] Many of these poems were collected in his 1971 book Beware, Soul Brother. One of his most famous, [...] "Refugee Mother and Child", spoke to <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>and</b> loss that surrounded him. Dedicated to the promise of Biafra, he accepted a request to serve as foreign ambassador, refusing an invitation from the Program of African Studies at Northwestern University in the US.

500|$|Helena had a firm {{interest}} in nursing, {{and was the}} founding chair of the Ladies' Committee of the British Red Cross in 1870, playing {{an active role in}} recruiting nurses and organising relief supplies during the Franco-Prussian War. She subsequently became President of the British Nurses' Association (RBNA) upon its foundation in 1887. In 1891, it received the prefix [...] "Royal", and received the Royal Charter the following year. She was a strong supporter of nurse registration, an issue that was opposed by both Florence Nightingale and leading public figures. In a speech Helena made in 1893, she made clear that the RBNA was working towards [...] "improving the education and status of those devoted and self-sacrificing women whose whole lives have been devoted to tending the sick, <b>the</b> <b>suffering,</b> <b>and</b> the dying". In the same speech, she warned about opposition and misrepresentation they had encountered. Although the RBNA was in favour of [...] registration as a means of enhancing and guaranteeing the professional status of trained nurses, its incorporation with the Privy Council allowed it to maintain a list rather than a formal register of nurses.|$|E
