5|$|Gielgud's final West End {{play was}} Hugh Whitemore's <b>The</b> <b>Best</b> <b>of</b> <b>Friends</b> (1988). He played Sir Sydney Cockerell, {{director}} of the Fitzwilliam Museum, in a representation of a friendship between Cockerell, Bernard Shaw and Laurentia McLachlan, a Benedictine nun. Gielgud had some trouble learning his lines; at one performance he almost forgot them, momentarily distracted by seeing in a 1938 copy of The Times, read by his character, a review of his own portrayal of Vershinin in Three Sisters fifty years earlier.|$|E

5|$|Between 1871 and 1874, {{while he}} lectured at the Conservatory, Rimsky-Korsakov {{thoroughly}} grounded himself in Western compositional techniques, {{and came to}} believe in the value of academic training for success as a composer. Once Rimsky-Korsakov had made this turn-around, Tchaikovsky considered him an esteemed colleague, and, if not <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends,</b> was at least on friendly terms with him. When the other members of The Five became hostile toward Rimsky-Korsakov for his change of attitude, Tchaikovsky continued to support Rimsky-Korsakov morally, telling him that he fully applauded what Rimsky-Korsakov was doing, and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. Beginning in 1876, Tchaikovsky was a regular visitor to the Rimsky-Korsakov home during his trips to Saint Petersburg. At one point, Tchaikovsky offered to have Rimsky-Korsakov appointed to the directorship of the Moscow Conservatory, but he refused.|$|E

500|$|Along {{with his}} estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical {{competitiveness}} {{with him and}} kept an ear on his music. During his five-year career break he was content to sit back as long as McCartney was producing what Lennon saw as mediocre material. Lennon took notice when McCartney released [...] "Coming Up" [...] in 1980, which was the year Lennon returned to the studio and {{the last year of}} his life. [...] "It's driving me crackers!" [...] he jokingly complained, because he could not get the tune out of his head. That same year, Lennon was asked whether the group were dreaded enemies or <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends,</b> and he replied that they were neither, and that he had not seen any of them in a long time. But he also said, [...] "I still love those guys. The Beatles are over, but John, Paul, George and Ringo go on." ...|$|E
500|$|Ruth's {{marriage}} to David {{is central to}} her character. Finch explained that it took Ruth a while {{to see that there}} were good qualities in David, as his initial behaviour towards her was unpleasant. Finch called David [...] "a sexist pig" [...] and said he resented Ruth's presence almost immediately. However, Ruth had noticed his ruggedness and she was attracted to the way he helped the sickly animals. After David noticed his brother flirting with Ruth, he realised that he loved her and told her about his feelings. Despite getting off to a bad start, Ruth and David began dating and were married towards the end of 1988. Finch thought Ruth and David had [...] "a really believable partnership" [...] and were well-suited, saying [...] "They are both very capable of becoming highly emotional if something riles them but thankfully they tend to react to different things. So, often one will be able to calm, soothe and support the other through most crises. Or at least provide some kind of balance to a problem." [...] The actress added that Ruth and David are <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Carpenter's {{attorneys}} {{attacked the}} prosecution's case as circumstantial and inconclusive. They presented evidence, including witnesses {{from the restaurant}} where {{the two men had}} dined the evening prior to the murder, that Carpenter and Crane were still <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends.</b> [...] They noted that the murder weapon had never been identified or found; the prosecution's camera tripod theory was sheer speculation, they said, based solely on Carpenter's occupation. They disputed the claim that the newly discovered evidence photo showed brain tissue, and presented many examples of [...] "sloppy work" [...] by police, such as the mishandling and misplacing of evidence—including the crucial tissue sample itself. [...] They pointed out that Crane had been videotaped and photographed in compromising sexual positions with numerous women, implying that any one of them, fearing blackmail, might have been the killer. Other potential suspects proposed by defense attorneys included angry husbands and boyfriends of the seduced women, and an actor who had sworn vengeance after a violent argument with Crane in Texas several months earlier.|$|E
2500|$|Benjamin {{said when}} it comes to Lisa and Phil, [...] "there's always going to be drama [...] there's going to be fireworks" [...] as Phil [...] "isn't Lisa’s {{favourite}} person" [...] and [...] "in true Lisa and Phil fashion, it will be quite explosive." [...] Lisa sees Phil as the person that [...] "triggers episodes of things going wrong for her" [...] and the one who has [...] "caused all of the problems going on her life", caused by him taking Louise away from her, that leads to her wariness around him as she knows [...] "what he’s capable of doing." [...] Benjamin believes Lisa and Phil will never [...] "be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> or see eye-to-eye", but Louise should be the person they put first and be adults for. Lisa sees Sharon as [...] "the right woman for Phil" [...] and regards her as [...] "lovely", so she needs Sharon as an [...] "ally" [...] in order to help her relationship with Louise, but knows Sharon is [...] "no fool", who [...] "will stand her ground." [...] Benjamin added Lisa [...] "feels very guilty" [...] about leaving Louise and being excluded from her life, but her [...] "driving force is her unconditional love for her child", but has [...] "hard times ahead with Louise, explaining why she hasn’t been there. I think she just hopes her daughter will need her and see she’s better off having her mum in her life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following Button's fourth-place finish, {{which was}} the fifth time in the season that he {{finished}} in the top four, he stated he did not compete to attempt to prove anything but was in the sport [...] "to do my job and my job is to do the best job I can for myself and for the team and that's exactly what I did." [...] However, he was delighted at his battle with the Williams team, saying, [...] "It was a lot of fun. And then the battle with Kimi Raikkonen, going past him was mega – I really enjoyed that. We're not <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> but we battle hard but clean." [...] Alonso did not feel frustrated towards teammate Räikkönen over the pair's late-race battle for sixth place: [...] "The most important thing was not the battle with him, it was the battle with the other teams and we got some good points for Ferrari today. Even if I could have overtaken Kimi a little quicker I had to save a lot of fuel {{in the last couple of}} laps so a battle with Sebastian was never a possibility." [...] Räikkönen dismissed the battle as [...] "normal racing" [...] and felt the duel had not hindered his team because it made no difference for him or Ferrari, and no matter where he finished, the team would accumulate the same amount of points.|$|E
