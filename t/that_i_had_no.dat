To pursue her goal, she moved to Scottsdale, Arizona at the age of 15 and attended Horizon High School during her junior and senior years while living with multiple host families. Despite having a challenging time adjusting to life without her family and friends, she helped lead Sereno Soccer Club to state titles in 2007 and 2008. Of her move to the United States, she said, [...] "It was not easy. It {{was probably one of the}} most difficult things I ever had to do, move away from everything that I knew and was comfortable with to something <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea about. Not having any family around. Doing it on my own. As a 15-year-old, that's kind of hard. I had to grow up really fast [...] But I guess it's all worth it. Now I have a chance to prove myself, and that's what I enjoy, and that's why I did what I did." ...|$|E
500|$|Nichols {{had done}} {{commercial}} work {{and had a}} bit part as a model in the romantic drama film Autumn in New York (2000) when her modeling agent helped her get a one-episode role in the fourth season of Sex and the City (2002). She later said she had [...] "never really done a proper audition before", and added that [...] "I had such fun , that day actually {{made me want to}} pursue [...] more seriously." [...] Later that year she was cast in her first major film role as Jessica, a dogged student newspaper reporter, in [...] (2003). Although the film was panned by critics, making it was a learning experience for Nichols. She said, [...] "I was a sponge for the entire time I was in Atlanta [...] and freely admitted <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea what was going on. I had never done a big film before, I had never been the lead in a film before and any advice anyone wanted to give me, I was more than willing to take." [...] The following year, Nichols played a member of a high school debate team in the independent film Debating Robert Lee (2004) and had a two-episode role in the crime drama television series Line of Fire (2004), which was cancelled after 11 of 13 produced episodes were broadcast. By August 2004, she was cast in supporting roles in the horror films The Amityville Horror (2005) and The Woods (2006).|$|E
500|$|On {{his arrival}} in the United States, Woo went through several scripts before {{deciding}} on Hard Target. Describing the scripts he received, Woo stated that [...] "Some of them were good—some of them were very good—but the rest were simply martial-arts movies and I told producers <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> interest in doing those kinds of films anymore. I'd {{done a lot of}} them already." [...] One of the scripts offered to Woo at this period was for Face/Off, which he turned down at the time, turned off by the science fiction aspect of the story. The script for Hard Target was written by Chuck Pfarrer. Director Andrew Davis was interested in the script, but ultimately turned it down. Woo read Pfarrer's script for Hard Target appreciating that it was a [...] "simple but powerful story, with a lot of feeling underneath. For a good action film you need a solid structure. Chuck gave me that". Woo also stated that the story is [...] "less John Woo" [...] but the visual aspect would be [...] "very John Woo". Pfarrer wrote the script originally basing it on the film The Naked Prey. After the script did not turn out Pfarrer worked on a script influenced by the film Aliens that became the basis for his comic Virus. The final attempt was a script based on the 1932 film The Most Dangerous Game. Pfarrer had the story take place in New Orleans to give an explanation of Jean-Claude Van Damme's accent.|$|E

2500|$|An {{accident}} {{occurred during}} the 2009 FIA WTCC Race of France in Pau, France. A succession of first-lap accidents caused the safety car {{to be placed on}} standby, with yellow flags waving on the start-finish section of the track. The safety car driver then proceeded to drive onto the track at slow speed, without official approval, moving across the pit exit line immediately after exiting the pits, instead of confining to the inside of it until the line ended. Race leader Franz Engstler came through the kink on the start-finish straight and was unable to avoid hitting the side of the pace car. Engstler commented [...] "I saw the safety car coming out from the right and realized <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> chance to brake...

2500|$|Vita's first {{close friend}} was Rosamund Grosvenor (5 September 1888 – 30 June 1944), who {{was four years}} her senior. Rosamund was the {{daughter}} of Algernon Henry Grosvenor (1864–1907), and the granddaughter of Robert Grosvenor, 1st Baron Ebury. Vita met Rosamund at Miss Woolf's school in 1899, when Rosamund had been invited to cheer Vita up while her father was fighting in the Second Boer War. Rosamund and Vita later shared a governess for their morning lessons. As they grew up together, Vita fell in love with Rosamund, whom she called 'Roddie' or 'Rose' or 'the Rubens lady'. Rosamund, in turn, was besotted with Vita. [...] "Oh, I dare say I realized vaguely <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> business to sleep with Rosamund, and I should certainly never have allowed anyone to find it out," [...] she admits in her journal, but she saw no real conflict: [...] "I really was innocent." ...|$|E

2500|$|Schwarzenegger {{wanted to}} move from {{bodybuilding}} into acting, finally achieving {{it when he was}} chosen {{to play the role of}} Hercules in 1970's Hercules in New York. Credited under the stage name [...] "Arnold Strong", his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production. His second film appearance was as a deaf-mute mob hitman in The Long Goodbye (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film Stay Hungry (1976), for which he was awarded a Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: [...] "It was very difficult for me in the beginning– I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> chance." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2000 Panahi made The Circle, {{produced}} by Jafar Panahi Film Productions and Mikado-Lumiere Although Panahi {{claimed that he}} was not a political filmmaker, his third feature was a major departure from his first two works about children and is critical of the treatment of women under Iran's Islamist regime. Panahi has stated that [...] "I started my career making children’s films, and while doing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> problems with censors. As soon as I started making feature films, it all started and I had problems," [...] but that [...] "in my first films, I worked with children and young people, but I began to think of the limitations facing these girls once they grow up. In order to visualize these limitations and to have this constraint better projected visually, I went to a social class, which has more limitations to areas that are more underprivileged, so that this idea could come out ever stronger."

2500|$|The 1982 American {{theatrical}} version {{released by}} the studio included the [...] "happy ending" [...] and {{with the addition of}} Harrison Ford's voiceover. Although several different versions of the script had included a narration of some sort, Harrison Ford and Ridley Scott decided to add scenes to provide the information; but financiers rewrote and reinserted narration during post-production after test audience members indicated difficulty understanding the film. Scott did not have final cut privilege for the version released to cinemas. Ford said in 1999: [...] "I contested it mightily at the time. It was not an organic part of the film." [...] It has been suggested that Ford intentionally performed the voice-over badly, in the hope it would not be used, but in a 2002 interview with Playboy magazine, he said: [...] "I delivered it {{to the best of my}} ability, given <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> input. I never thought they'd use it. But I didn't try and sandbag it. It was simply bad narration." [...] The [...] "happy ending" [...] aerial shots were also not filmed by Scott, but rather were unused aerial helicopter shots from Stanley Kubrick's The Shining which Kubrick allowed the use of.|$|E

2500|$|When Darwin proved {{unable to}} persevere at medical studies, his father {{sent him to}} Christ's College, Cambridge, for a Bachelor of Arts degree {{as the first step}} towards {{becoming}} an Anglican parson. Darwin was at first uncertain, he later wrote: [...] "from what little I had heard and thought on the subject I had scruples about declaring my belief in all the dogmas of the Church of England; though otherwise I liked the thought of being a country clergyman. Accordingly I read with care 'Pearson on the Creed' and a few other books on divinity; and as I did not then in the least doubt the strict and literal truth of every word in the Bible, I soon persuaded myself that our Creed must be fully accepted. It never struck me how illogical it was to say that I believed in what I could not understand and what is in fact unintelligible. I might have said with entire truth <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> wish to dispute any dogma; but I never was such a fool as to feel and say 'credo quia incredibile'. He was particularly convinced by the reasoning of the Revd. John Bird Sumner's Evidences of Christianity which set out the logic that the unbelief of sceptics gave them the dilemma that if Christianity were untrue, then either [...] "Jesus did not live, or he actually lived, but was not the Son of God, hence an imposter." [...] The Gospels made this highly improbable, as his miracles had convinced unbelievers, hence we had [...] "no right to deny" [...] that such events were probable. Jesus's religion was [...] "wonderfully suitable... to our ideas of happiness in this & the next world" [...] and there was [...] "no other way... of explaining the series of evidence & probability." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sun Ce told Taishi Ci, [...] "In the past, when Liu Yao criticised me {{for helping}} Yuan Shu conquer Lujiang, he didn't have good {{intentions}} and his reasons were not convincing. Why? Yuan Shu had {{control over the}} thousands of troops {{which used to be}} under my father's command. I wanted to make great achievements, so I {{had no choice but to}} submit to Yuan Shu and ask him to give me control of my father's troops. Even then, he only gave me back about 1,000 men. When he ordered me to attack Lujiang, the circumstances I was in were so desperate <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> choice but to obey him. Later on, he turned evil and wanted to commit treacherous acts. I tried to dissuade him but he wouldn't listen. That was when I decided to sever ties with him. My relationship with Yuan Shu is only up to this extent. Now that Liu Yao is dead, there is no chance for me to explain to him anymore. However, his son still lives in Yuzhang. I don't know how Hua Ziyu treats him, and whether Liu Yao's former followers have decided to serve Hua Ziyu. You are from the same commandery as Liu Yao, and you served under him before. I hope you can visit his son and convey my wishes to his followers. If they wish to join me, I will welcome them; if they don't, do treat them kindly. At the same time, you can assess how strong Hua Ziyu's defences are, and see if the peoples of Luling and Poyang are willing to join me. You can bring along as many men as you wish." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I have committed unpardonable acts. Yet, you treat me as generously as how Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin treated former enemies who surrendered to them. The ancients lived by a code of loyalty until death. I don't need too many men to accompany me. Just a dozen or so will be sufficient." ...|$|E
