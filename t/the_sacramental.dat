5|$|From {{the end of}} {{the sixteenth}} century through the eighteenth century, a period known as Reformed orthodoxy, Reformed baptismal {{theology}} further developed the covenantal meaning of baptism. Theologians more carefully defined <b>the</b> <b>sacramental</b> union of baptism, or the relationship between the outward washing with that which it signifies. In the high orthodox period (middle to late seventeenth century), theologians such as Hermann Witsius expanded the covenantal meaning of baptism using analogies such as Noah's Ark and the crossing of the Red Sea, which carried the theological themes of the resurrection and eternal life. This period also saw the emergence of Reformed Baptists. Reformed Baptist theologians had much in common with the Reformed, but saw baptism {{as a sign of the}} baptized's fellowship with Christ rather than a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, and as a result did not baptize their children.|$|E
25|$|Official {{writings}} of the churches of the Anglican Communion have consistently affirmed Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist, a term that includes {{a belief in the}} corporeal presence, <b>the</b> <b>sacramental</b> union, as well as several other eucharistic theologies.|$|E
25|$|Bernini's final {{work for}} St. Peter's, {{undertaken}} in 1676, was {{the decoration of}} the Chapel of the Sacrament.

On either side is an angel, one gazing in rapt adoration and the other looking towards the viewer in welcome. Bernini died in 1680 in his 82nd year.|$|E

50|$|According to the Catholic Church, {{the means}} of grace that Christ {{entrusted}} to the Church are many. They include the entirety of revealed truth, the sacraments and the hierarchical ministry. Among the principal means of grace are the sacraments (especially the Eucharist), prayers and good works. <b>The</b> <b>sacramentals</b> also are means of grace.|$|R
25|$|The Roman Catholic Church {{maintains}} that the legitimate use of sacramentals in its proper disposition is encouraged only by a firm faith and devotion to the Trinity, and not by any magical or superstitious belief bestowed on <b>the</b> <b>sacramental.</b> In this regard, rosaries, scapulars, medals, and other devotional religious Catholic paraphernalia derive their power, not simply from the symbolism created by the object, but rather from {{the blessing of the}} Catholic Church which comes from the Trinity.|$|E
25|$|Blannbekin {{was born}} in Plambach, Austria to a peasant family. Her surname, which is also {{sometimes}} spelled Blanbakin, comes from {{the name of this}} village (i.e., Plambachen). At the age of seven or eight, Blannbekin began secretly giving her meals to the poor. By the age of ten or eleven, she began craving <b>the</b> <b>sacramental</b> bread. In around 1260, she joined the Third Order of Saint Francis in Vienna; {{for the rest of her}} life she refused to eat meat, claiming the body of Christ was enough meat for her.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until this}} time, with the {{exception}} of Strawbridge, none of the missionaries or American preachers was ordained. Consequently, the Methodist people received the sacraments at the hands of ministers from established Anglican churches. Most of the Anglican priests were Loyalists who fled to England, New York or Canada during the war. In the absence of Anglican ordination, a group of native preachers ordained themselves. This caused a split between the Asbury faction and the southern preachers. Asbury mediated the crisis by convincing the southern preachers to wait for Wesley's response to <b>the</b> <b>sacramental</b> crisis. That response came in 1784.|$|E

25|$|Civil {{authorities}} in the United States are usually respectful of this confidentiality, but in Eugene, Oregon, in 1996, jail authorities {{with the approval of}} the local District Attorney, clandestinely recorded <b>the</b> <b>sacramental</b> confession of a jailed suspect without the knowledge of the priest or the penitent. Following official protests by then local Archbishop Francis George and the Holy See, the tape was sealed but has never been destroyed.

She wears a crown and is dressed in a surcoat over a costly brocade skirt, symbols of royal status. St Barbara, patron of soldiers, sits opposite reading a missal in front of her emblem (the tower in which her father held her prisoner), which is shaped as a monstrance meant to hold <b>the</b> <b>sacramental</b> bread.

25|$|In Portugal, as in {{the rest}} of Europe, the {{printing}} press {{played a key role in}} its Renaissance. The first printing presses came to Portugal by the hand of Jewish printers via Italy. The first book printed in Portuguese in Portugal was <b>the</b> <b>Sacramental,</b> printed in Chaves, in 1488, by Clemente Sanches de Vercial. By 1490, books were being printed in Lisbon, Porto, and Braga. Because of the new access to mass production of language and literature pieces, the Portuguese Renaissance saw a great flourishment for written work, from treatises to theatre, as well as the advancement and sophistication of the Portuguese language. Because of Portugal's key place in global relations, at the time, literary works of the Portuguese Renaissance influenced a great deal of foreign literary movements and linguistic studies.|$|E

25|$|As {{numbers of}} clergy increased, the small apse which {{contained}} the altar, or table upon which <b>the</b> <b>sacramental</b> {{bread and wine}} were offered in the rite of Holy Communion, was not sufficient to accommodate them. A raised dais called a bema formed part of many large basilican churches. In the case of St. Peter's Basilica and San Paolo fuori le Mura (St Paul's outside the Walls) in Rome, this bema extended laterally beyond the main meeting hall, forming two arms so that the building took on {{the shape of a}} T with a projecting apse. From this beginning, the plan of the church developed into the so-called Latin Cross which is the shape of most Western Cathedrals and large churches. The arms of the cross are called the transept.|$|E
25|$|The Scottish Episcopalian Church was a {{combination}} of non-juror churches who did not accept the House of Hanover until the death of the last member of the House of Stuart in 1788, and Qualified Chapels of those that accepted the Hanoverians or were members of the Church of England resident in Scotland. A strand of Evangelicalism developed in the Church in the early nineteenth century, mainly among English and Irish immigrants to Lowland towns. It was less interested in <b>the</b> <b>sacramental</b> traditions of the church and put an emphasis on communicating a simple gospel message, leading to clashes with the High Church tendency within the Church. In 1843, the same year as the Great Disruption, a group in Edinburgh, under its leading figure David Drummond, broke away to form a separate English Episcopal congregation. There were fears that the schism would spread, but the departures weakened the Evangelical party within the church and it never recovered its position.|$|E

50|$|An interdict {{today has}} the effect of forbidding the person {{concerned}} to celebrate or receive any of the sacraments, including the Eucharist, or to celebrate <b>the</b> <b>sacramentals.</b> One who is under interdict is also forbidden to take any ministerial part (e.g., as a reader if a layperson or as a deacon or priest if a clergyman) in the celebration of the Eucharist or of any other ceremony of public worship.|$|R
500|$|In Reformed sacramental theology, {{the sign}} (in {{the case of}} baptism the {{external}} washing with water) may be {{described in terms of}} the thing signified (regeneration, remission of sin, etc.), because of the close connection between them. For example, baptism may be said to save, and baptism is often called the [...] "laver of regeneration". However, there is also a distinction between the sign and thing signified. The sign is seen as a pledge and seal of the inward washing of regeneration and purification. <b>The</b> <b>sacramental</b> union between the sign and thing signified means that the use or purpose of the visible action of the sacrament is changed even as its substance remains the same.|$|E
500|$|In 1520 the confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament (...) was {{entrusted}} with the church's care. The confraternity originated in Borgo in 1509. On a windy evening of 1506, a Carmelite {{coming from the}} old Santa Maria in Traspontina church (lying near Castel Sant'Angelo), followed by a lay brother bearing a candle, was bringing <b>the</b> <b>sacramental</b> bread to a sick person. Since the wind had extinguished the candle, the layman went into a nearby shop asking for fire, so that the priest was left alone. At {{the sight of the}} lone priest bearing the blessed Sacrament, several passers-by were moved, gathered around him and accompanied him, bearing a baldachin and torches. The group grew, and on 3 September 1509 its members formed a compagnia. The Carmelites assigned it to a chapel in Santa Maria in Traspontina, and in 1513 Pope Leo X (r. 1513–21) acknowledged the association, which in 1520 moved to San Giacomo.|$|E
500|$|Both Æthelberht and Sæberht died around 616 or 618, {{causing a}} crisis for the mission. Sæberht's three sons had not {{converted}} to Christianity, and drove Mellitus from London. Bede says that Mellitus was exiled because he refused the brothers' {{request for a}} taste of <b>the</b> <b>sacramental</b> bread. Whether this occurred immediately after Sæberht's death or later is impossible to determine from Bede's chronology, which has both events in the same chapter but gives neither an exact time frame nor the elapsed time between the two events. The historian N. J. Higham connects {{the timing of this}} episode with a change in the [...] "overkingship" [...] from the Christian Kentish Æthelberht to the pagan East Anglian Raedwald, which Higham feels happened after Æthelberht's death. In Higham's view, Sæberht's sons drove Mellitus from London because they had passed from Kentish overlordship to East Anglian, and thus no longer needed to keep Mellitus, who was connected with the Kentish kingdom, in office.|$|E

500|$|Justice Sandile Ngcobo, {{writing for}} the minority, said that [...] "he {{limitation}} analysis ... involves the weighing up of competing values and ultimately an assessment based on proportionality", and that in weighing competing interests and evaluating proportionality it was [...] "necessary to examine {{the relation between the}} complete ban on <b>the</b> <b>sacramental</b> use or possession of cannabis by the Rastafari and the purpose of the limitation as well as the existence of the less restrictive means to achieve this purpose".

500|$|Catechisms {{produced}} in specific dioceses from the mid-fourteenth century emphasized the Commandments {{and laid the}} foundation for the first official Church-wide catechism, the 1566 Roman Catechism. Commissioned by the Council of Trent, it provided [...] "thorough discussions of each commandment" [...] but gave greater emphasis to the seven sacraments to emphasize the Catholic belief that Christian life was dependent upon the grace solely obtained through <b>the</b> <b>sacramental</b> life provided by the Catholic Church. This emphasis conflicted with Protestant beliefs, which held the Commandments as the source of divine grace. While more recent papal encyclicals offer interpretations of Church teaching on individual commandments, throughout history official Church teachings on the Commandments are based on their mentions in the Old and New Testaments and the writings of the early Church Fathers Origen, Irenaeus and Augustine. Later, theologians Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure offered notable commentaries on the Commandments. Aquinas, a Doctor of the Church, considered them to be the [...] "primary precepts of justice and all law, and natural reason gives immediate assent to them as being plainly evident principles." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1526, Bucer {{published}} Apologia, {{defending his}} views. He proposed {{a formula that}} he hoped would satisfy both sides: different understandings of scripture were acceptable, and church unity was assured so long as both sides had a [...] "child-like faith in God". Bucer stated that his and Zwingli's interpretation on the eucharist was the correct one, but while he considered the Wittenberg theologians to be in error, he accepted them as brethren as they agreed on the fundamentals of faith. He also published two translations of works by Luther and Johannes Bugenhagen, interpolating his own interpretation of the Lord's Supper into the text. This outraged the Wittenberg theologians and damaged their relations with Bucer. [...] In 1528, when Luther published , detailing Luther's concept of <b>the</b> <b>sacramental</b> union, Bucer responded with a treatise of his own, [...] It {{took the form of}} a dialogue between two merchants, one from Nuremberg who supported Luther and the other from Strasbourg who supported Bucer, with the latter winning over his opponent. Bucer noted that as Luther had rejected impanation, the idea that Christ was [...] "made into bread", there was no disagreement between Luther and Zwingli; both believed in a spiritual presence of Christ in the eucharist. Luther harshly rejected Bucer's interpretation.|$|E
