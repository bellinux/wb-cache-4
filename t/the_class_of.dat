5|$|In 1923, John von Neumann {{developed}} an axiom system that eliminates the paradoxes {{by using an}} approach similar to Cantor's—namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and treating them differently. Von Neumann stated that a class is too big to be a set {{if it can be}} put into one-to-one correspondence with <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> all sets. He defined a set as a class that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> all sets. This axiom implies that these big classes are not sets, which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class. Von Neumann also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction implies that <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> all ordinals is not a set. Then his axiom provides a one-to-one correspondence between this class and <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> all sets. This correspondence well-orders <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> all sets, which implies the well-ordering theorem. In 1930, Zermelo defined models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's axiom.|$|E
