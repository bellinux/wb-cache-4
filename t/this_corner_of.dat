25|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, {{there had been}} a small inner court in <b>this</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the Enderûn Courtyard. This court led through the Kuşhane Gate into the harem. Today this is the gate from which the {{visitors}} exit from the Harem. Birds were raised for the sultan's table in the buildings around the gate. On the inscription over the Kuşhane door one reads that Mahmud I had the kitchen of the Kuşhane repaired. The balcony of the aviary facing the Harem Gate was constructed during repair work in 1916. The building's facade resembles traditional aviaries.|$|E
25|$|Tetepetl Hill is a sharp {{rise from}} the Valley of the Matlatzinco running along {{the west side of}} the modern town of Tenango de Arista in the State of Mexico. It forms an {{elongated}} mesa, with steep slopes on the north and east sides, varying in height from 70 to 250 meters that serve as natural defenses. While the surface of this mesa is 16.5km2, only about 2km2 in the extreme northeast of the mesa was inhabited. With the exception of <b>this</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the mesa, the entire hill is covered by a layer of dark gray solidified lava, the result of a volcanic eruption that occurred approximately 10,000 years ago. This makes most of the mesa difficult to cross and impossible to farm. To make the city possible, the northeast corner needed to be significantly modified by terracing and filling in low areas. The mesa contains no rivers, but there are a number of fresh-water springs which served as the ancient city’s water supply.|$|E

This sequence, which took {{two days to}} film, was shot on a dry expanse of land located an hour outside of Los Angeles. This area had been {{selected}} due to its resembles to an Iraqi desert. Series' co-executive producer Michelle MacLaren said: [...] "We [...] were {{way out in the}} desert and we drove around <b>this</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> these hills and I felt like we had entered another country. It was so desolate, and there were these stone buildings that looked like a bomb had gone off in them. It was perfect."

2500|$|The {{population}} of Lebanon {{was estimated to}} be [...] in , however no official census has been conducted since 1932 due to the sensitive confessional political balance between Lebanon's various religious groups. Identifying all Lebanese as ethnically Arab is a widely employed example of panethnicity since in reality, the Lebanese [...] "are descended from many different peoples who have occupied, invaded, or settled <b>this</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the world", making Lebanon, [...] "a mosaic of closely interrelated cultures". While at first glance, this ethnic, linguistic, religious and denominational diversity might seem to cause civil and political unrest, [...] "for much of Lebanon’s history this multitudinous diversity of religious communities has coexisted with little conflict".|$|E
2500|$|Located a {{few miles}} from the mouth of the Calycadnus (Greek: Kalykadnos, {{currently}} Göksu) River, Seleucia was founded by Seleucus I Nicator in the early 3rd century BCE, one of several cities he named after himself. It is probable that there were already towns called Olbia (or Olba) and Hyria and that Seleucus I merely united them giving them his name. The city grew to include the nearby settlement of Holmi (in modern-day Taşucu) which had been established earlier as an Ionian colony but being on the coast was vulnerable to raiders and pirates. [...] The new city up river was doubtless seen as safer against attacks from the sea so Seleucia achieved considerable commercial prosperity as a port for <b>this</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> Cilicia (later named Isauria), and was even a rival of Tarsus.|$|E

There is {{a cascade of}} [...] high leading out of the Eleven Acre Lake by a tunnel under the Warden Hill Walk on {{the western edge of}} the garden, into the Copper Bottom lake that was created in the 1830s just to the south-west of the gardens. The lake was originally lined with copper to waterproof the porous chalk into which the lake was dug. The copper was replaced by butyl sheeting when the Trust restored the lake. The rivers and lakes of both the park and gardens have many species of fish including: carp, perch, pike, roach, rudd & tench. The house's kitchen garden, extensively rebuilt by the 2nd Duke, was located at Dadford about 2/3 of mile north of the house. Only a few remains of the three walled gardens now exist, but originally they were divided into four and centred around fountains. There is evidence of the heating system: cast iron pipes used to heat greenhouses, which protected the fruit and vegetables, including then-exotic fruits, like peaches. About a mile and half north of the house lies Haymanger pond, which is a haven for wildlife and attracts grebes, snipe, buzzards and grass snakes, as well as other species. In what used to be the extreme north-east corner of the park, about [...] from the house over the county border lies Silverstone Circuit. <b>This</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the park used to be heavily wooded, known as Stowe Woods, with a series of avenues cut through the trees, over a mile of one of these avenues (or riding) still survives terminated in the north by the racing circuit and aligned to the south on the Wolfe Obelisk though there is a gap of over half mile between the two. It is here that one can find the remains of the gardener's treehouse, an innovative design comprising wood and textiles. The National Trust have reintroduced Longhorn cattle to graze the park north of the house.|$|E

2500|$|The Luncheon on the Grass is the {{greatest}} work of Édouard Manet, {{one in which he}} realizes the dream of all painters: to place figures of natural grandeur in a landscape. [...] We know the power with which he vanquished this difficulty. [...] There are some leaves, some tree trunks, and, in the background, a river in which a chemise-wearing woman bathes; in the foreground, two young men are seated across from a second woman who has just exited the water and who dries her naked skin in the open air. [...] This nude woman has scandalized the public, who see only her in the canvas. [...] My God! [...] What indecency: a woman without the slightest covering between two clothed men! [...] That has never been seen. [...] And this belief is a gross error, for in the Louvre there are more than fifty paintings in which are found mixes of persons clothed and nude. [...] But no one goes to the Louvre to be scandalized. [...] The crowd has kept itself moreover from judging The Luncheon on the Grass like a veritable work of art should be judged; they see in it only some people who are having a picnic, finishing bathing, and they believed that the artist had placed an obscene intent in the disposition of the subject, while the artist had simply sought to obtain vibrant oppositions and a straightforward audience. [...] Painters, especially Édouard Manet, who is an analytic painter, do not have this preoccupation with the subject which torments the crowd above all; the subject, for them, is merely a pretext to paint, while for the crowd, the subject alone exists. [...] Thus, assuredly, the nude woman of The Luncheon on the Grass is only there to furnish the artist the occasion to paint a bit of flesh. [...] That which must be seen in the painting is not a luncheon on the grass; it is the entire landscape, with its vigors and its finesses, with its foregrounds so large, so solid, and its backgrounds of a light delicateness; it is this firm modeled flesh under great spots of light, these tissues supple and strong, and particularly this delicious silhouette of a woman wearing a chemise who makes, in the background, an adorable dapple of white in the milieu of green leaves. [...] It is, in short, this vast ensemble, full of atmosphere, <b>this</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> nature rendered with a simplicity so just, all of this admirable page in which an artist has placed all the particular and rare elements which are in him.|$|E
