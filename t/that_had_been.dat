5|$|A later senatorial {{investigation}} into {{the disappearance of the}} public funds took no action against Octavian, since he subsequently used that money to raise troops against the Senate's arch enemy Mark Antony.

5|$|Another {{result of}} the coup was that the work <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> done by British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> achieved by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The coup and its immediate aftermath {{also contributed to the}} paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{during the rest of the}} war, due to ongoing disputes regarding the legitimacy of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the first attack took place, {{the walls of the}} fort still had not been finished, {{although}} they had been raised slightly. As a result of the hasty construction work, even at the wall's lowest part, it was high enough that the attacking force would need ladders to reach the top of the rampart. Every point where the fort was approachable, or thought weak by its defenders, was bolstered by stockades made out of stones and stakes <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> stuck into the ground. These were covered by cannons that were placed where they could be most effective, and a wicket gate that flanked {{a large part of the}} wall, was left open but cross-barred, to make it difficult for attacking soldiers to enter but also to channel their advance towards a cannon <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> placed at the gate to enfilade its approach with showers of grapeshot.|$|E
