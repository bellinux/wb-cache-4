5|$|According to {{the later}} Chronicle of Polish Dukes by Gallus, the battle {{occurred}} by accident: When Bolesław decided {{to throw a}} feast to boost his army's morale, Yaroslav's archers and scouts decided to create trouble for the Polish servants who were gutting the animals and preparing them near the river. However, they only annoyed <b>them</b> <b>enough</b> that the servants themselves crossed the relatively shallow river and chased away Yaroslav's surprised troops, who had been guarding the river. Bolesław learned of the skirmish sooner than Yaroslav, and managed to move most of his army across the river, defeating the surprised Yaroslav.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the {{formation}} of the Commando unit was changed. Each Commando now consisted of a small headquarters group, five fighting troops, a heavy weapons troop, and a signals platoon. The fighting troops consisted of 65 men of all ranks divided into two 30–man sections which were subdivided into three 10–man subsections. The heavy weapons troop was made up of 3-inch mortar and Vickers machine gun teams. The Commandos were provided with the motor transport needed to accompany them on operations. Their transport now consisted of the commanding officer's car, 15 motorcycles (six with side cars), ten 15 cwt trucks, and three 3-ton trucks. The heavy weapons troop had seven Jeeps and trailers and one Jeep for each of the fighting troops and the headquarters. This gave <b>them</b> <b>enough</b> vehicles of their own to accommodate two fighting troops, the heavy weapons troop, and the Commando Headquarters.|$|E
5|$|L/16 {{eventually}} landed, 30 minutes late, to {{the left}} of Fox Green, taking casualties as the boats ran in and more as they crossed the 200 yards (180m) of beach. The terrain at the very eastern end of Omaha gave <b>them</b> <b>enough</b> protection to allow the 125 survivors to organize and begin an assault of the bluffs. They were the only company in the first wave able to operate as a unit. All the other companies were, at best, disorganized, mostly leaderless and pinned down behind the shingle with no hope of carrying out their assault missions. At worst, they had ceased to exist as fighting units. Nearly all had landed at least a few hundred yards off target, and in an intricately planned operation where each section on each boat had been assigned a specific task, this was enough to throw the whole plan off.|$|E

5000|$|In the Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture, Peter Childs {{noted that}} the roots of big beat music, which became popular in the late 1990s, could {{be traced back to}} Give <b>'Em</b> <b>Enough</b> Dope Volume One, {{as well as to the}} Beastie Boys' album Paul's Boutique (1989). Jones later spoke with Richard Dorfmeister {{regarding}} the song [...] "High Noon" [...] on the former's radio show. Two sequels to the album were released, Give <b>'Em</b> <b>Enough</b> Dope Volume Two (1995) and Give <b>'Em</b> <b>Enough</b> Dope Volume Three (1996), both of which were even more popular and successful than the original album, with Robert Christgau naming the second edition the sixth best compilation of 1995.|$|R
5|$|Taoism was the {{official}} {{religion of the}} Tang. Buddhism, originating in India {{around the time of}} Confucius, continued its influence during the Tang period and was accepted by some members of imperial family, becoming thoroughly sinicized and a permanent part of Chinese traditional culture. In an age before Neo-Confucianism and figures such as Zhu Xi (1130–1200), Buddhism had begun to flourish in China during the Northern and Southern dynasties, and became the dominant ideology during the prosperous Tang. Buddhist monasteries played an integral role in Chinese society, offering lodging for travelers in remote areas, schools for children throughout the country, and a place for urban literati to stage social events and gatherings such as going-away parties. Buddhist monasteries were also engaged in the economy, since their land property and serfs gave <b>them</b> <b>enough</b> revenues to set up mills, oil presses, and other enterprises. Although the monasteries retained 'serfs', these monastery dependents could actually own property and employ others to help them in their work, including their own slaves.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} {{had been}} costly for both sides. Australian casualties included nine killed and 28 wounded, while one howitzer and two mortars had been damaged. North Vietnamese casualties included 52 dead, who lay strewn around the perimeter, while 23 small arms and seven crew-served weapons {{had also been}} captured by the Australians. While Radio Hanoi quickly announced a major North Vietnamese victory there was {{little doubt that the}} Australians had convincingly repulsed the attack, even if they had come close to suffering a military and political catastrophe, with the task force headquarters itself nearly being destroyed. The initial delays during the fly-in had left the defenders spread haphazardly and, had the North Vietnamese assaulted without the preparatory fire that ultimately alerted the Australians, the result may have been different. Equally, the fortunes of war had resulted in the Australian guns being laid {{in the direction of the}} main North Vietnamese assault, and the firepower they afforded had probably been decisive. The occupation of FSB Coral was one of the first such operations conducted by 1 ATF and many of the deficiencies evident had been due to this inexperience. Command and control had been insufficient and in hindsight the lack of co-ordination in setting up the defence could have been avoided with the appointment of a local defence commander. The absence of proper aerial reconnaissance prior to insertion had also resulted in units and their supporting elements landing on unsuitable ground in full view of the North Vietnamese, while the delay in the insertion of the second battalion denied <b>them</b> <b>enough</b> time to establish their positions before night fell. Failures in the assessment and timely distribution of intelligence were also identified.|$|E

25|$|Sailing {{from the}} Indian Ocean to the Bahamas was a journey {{halfway around the}} world, and the Fancy was forced to stop along the way at Ascension Island, located {{in the middle of}} the Atlantic.

The diner was named after a song by punk rock band The Clash, [...] "Rudie Can't Fail", from their album London Calling.

25|$|Three {{days after}} leaving Mopelia, the seamen reached Atiu Island, where they {{pretended to be}} Dutch-American mariners {{crossing}} the Pacific for a bet. The New Zealand Resident, the administrator of the island, gave <b>them</b> <b>enough</b> supplies to reach another island in the group, Aitutaki, where they posed as Norwegians. The New Zealand Resident in Aitutaki was suspicious but had no means of detaining the group, and Luckner quickly took his party to the island of Rarotonga. Approaching Rarotonga in the dark, Luckner saw a dark ship which he thought was an auxiliary cruiser, {{but in fact it}} was a beached ship.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, President Chen was re-elected to {{a second}} {{four-year}} term after an assassination attempt which occurred {{the day before the}} election. Two shots were fired, one bullet grazing the President's belly after penetrating the windshield of a jeep and several layers of clothing, the other bullet penetrated the windshield and hitting the vice president's knee cast (She was wearing a knee cast due to an earlier injury). Police investigators have said that the most likely suspect {{is believed to have been}} Chen Yi-hsiung, who was later found dead. Their injuries were not life-threatening, but the incident is believed by Pan-Blue to have gained <b>them</b> <b>enough</b> sympathy to influence the result.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Californians {{voted on}} Proposition 2, which {{requires}} California farmers to provide egg-laying hens, veal calves, and pregnant pigs with housing that gives <b>them</b> <b>enough</b> room {{to move around}} beginning January 1, 2015. The law would mostly impact the state's 18 million egg-laying hens. The current industry standards call for caged hens {{to get at least}} 67 square inches of space each, a little less than a regular-size sheet of paper, (a sheet of paper is 93.5 square inches) and hens are typically caged in groups of two to eight. Proposition 2 grew into the most expensive animal welfare ballot measure ever, with both sides raising nearly $8 million each. The measure passed with 63.2 percent of the vote.|$|E
5000|$|Give <b>'Em</b> <b>Enough</b> Dope Volume One {{coincided with}} the {{development}} of numerous new electronic genres incorporating sampling and live instrumentation that are represented on the album. According to John Bush of AllMusic, Give <b>'Em</b> <b>Enough</b> Dope Volume One is an acid jazz and trip hop compilation of music by European artists that incorporates elements from other genres such as funk, soul, jazz and rap. The album's liner notes describe the music: [...] "'Jazz not jazz', 'soul not soul', 'hip not hop', call it what you won't, the atoms keep splitting and new genres are created almost every year. The combination of live playing and sampling has opened up another preverbial can of worms." [...] In his book Drum 'n' Bass: The Rough Guide, writer Peter Shapiro also felt that the album incorporates downtempo music.|$|R
5000|$|The main riff is very {{reminiscent}} to The Who's debut single, [...] "I Can't Explain"'s main riff, {{and sounds}} like it has been expanded by The Clash.

25|$|The {{first day}} of the match at Stormont, Belfast was rained off, and Ireland, knowing that plenty of runs would give <b>them</b> <b>enough</b> to see them through to the semi-finals, chose to bat out 90 overs. The entire top order contributed with half-centuries and centuries - Jeremy Bray top scoring 135 - as the Dutch bowlers were slaughtered, debutant Ernst van Giezen taking two for 107 as the best bowler. Ireland {{declared}} on 407 for 4, having realised they could get no more points, and immediately dug into the Dutch top order. A recovery was staged thanks to a 115-run stand between Ryan ten Doeschate and Alexei Kervezee, but when Andre Botha took two wickets the Dutch realised the futility of their task. The match was eventually abandoned as a draw, which sent Ireland into the semi-finals of the tournament.|$|E
