Capote disapproved of many changes that were made to sanitise the story for the film adaptation, and would have {{preferred}} Marilyn Monroe to have been cast in the role, although he also stated that Hepburn [...] "did a terrific job". The character {{is considered one of}} the best-known in American cinema, and a defining role for Hepburn. The dress she wears during the opening credits is considered an icon of the twentieth century and perhaps the most famous [...] "little black dress" [...] of all time. Hepburn stated that the role was [...] "the jazziest of my career" [...] yet admitted: [...] "I'm an introvert. Playing the extroverted girl was <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> ever did." [...] She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.|$|E

On January 22, 1942, Carnegie was given an unconditional release from the Bisons, a move in which Buffalo general manager John Stiglmeier said [...] "was <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> ever had to do".|$|E

Our marriage has been on a false basis from the start, and I've been to blame for it. There is more to be said about the chances for a successful marriage in these days, but I'm not going to dwell on that now, or attempt to shoulder off my shortcomings on my bringing up, on the civilization in which we have lived. You've tried to do your share, and the failure hasn't been your fault.

5000|$|For over 25 years, Doug Ammons {{has been}} a world class kayaker. [...] He has {{accomplished}} many first descents, from the western states of Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho. Ammons also has travelled to many different areas for paddling, like Mexico, the Himalayas, South America, and Canada. Doug Ammons enjoys soloing rivers. In {{answer to a question}} asked by Ben Friberg about soloing, Ammons responded saying, [...] "The interesting thing is, I'm sure that nearly all serious paddlers solo at some point, mostly because it provides a truly rewarding sense of intimacy with a river". [...] The rivers he solos do not consist of just class III; he solos class V, deep gorges where paddlers need to be on top of their game for a successful trip. One river in particular that Doug Ammons soloed was the Grand Canyon of the Stikine. He was part of the second descent in 1990 but then decided he would solo it two years later. [...] Ammons comments later {{in an interview with the}} Missoulian, saying, [...] "I tried to do <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> could conceive of, in the purest style possible".

All graduate students rely on the vast network that makes up a lab and department and I have truly benefitted from this in more ways than I can recount. That said, I will attempt to acknowledge all of those individuals who have helped me reach this goal. I would like to first thank my advisors, Daryl Kipke and Cynthia Chestek. No graduate student is complete without their advisor and I have learned so much from them both. They have both taught me how to be a better scientist, engineer, and researcher. Throughout my many years at Michigan they have both always supported my research...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} wireless sensor networks, as illustrated by speck-nets, as an appropriate platform for developing novel immune-inspired algorithms. Properties {{of the immune system}} and wireless sensor networks are examined in parallel, revealing a potential mapping between the two. The cognitive view of the immune system is identified as appropriate for further investigation at the theoretical level, while the functionality of dendritic cells becomes the focus in terms of biology. An agent-based model is developed as an exercise in under-standing the dendritic cell function, emphasising the aspect of mobility. The model is then developed into a simulated implementation for specknets, using the application problem of temperature monitoring and control. The thesis concludes with an analysis about certain aspects the immune system and the specknet, and the proposal of a methodology to allow blending of ideas derived from two such complex systems. i Acknowledgements Preparing this thesis for submission is one of <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> ever did.
