[Footnote 28: In {{order that}} the reader who is not {{familiar}} with what is passing in New York may not suppose that exaggerated terms are here used, the writer will state a single expedient of the anti-renters in the Legislature to obtain their ends. It is generally known that the Constitution of the United States prevents the separate States from passing laws impairing the obligations of contracts. But for this provision of the Federal Constitution, it is probable, numbers would have succeeded, long ago, in obtaining {{the property of the}} few on their own terms, amid shouts in honor of liberty! This provision, however, has proved a stubborn obstacle, until the world, near {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century, has been favored with the following notable scheme to effect the ends of those who [...] "want farms and must have them." [...] The State can regulate, by statute, the laws of descents. It has, accordingly, been solemnly proposed in the Legislature of New York, that the statute of descents should be so far altered, that when a landlord, holding lands subject to certain leasehold tenures, dies, or a descent is cast, that it shall be lawful for the tenants, on application to the chancellor, to convert these leasehold tenures into mortgages, and to obtain the fee-simple of the estates in payment of the debt! In other words, A leases a farm to B forever, reserving a ground-rent, with covenants of re-entry, etc., etc. B wishes a deed, but will not pay A's price. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>says</b> the contract shall not be impaired, and the Legislature of New York is illustrated by the expedient we have named, to get over the provision of the Constitution! ...|$|E

50|$|In principle, an Australian {{resident}} is taxed on all worldwide income, while a non-resident is taxed only on Australian-sourced income. Both legs of {{the principle}} offer an opportunity for taxation {{in more than one}} jurisdiction. To avoid double taxation of income by different jurisdictions, Australia has entered into double taxation avoidance agreements (DTAs) with a number of other countries, under which both countries agree on which taxes will be paid to which country. For example, in the case of royalties, the DTA with <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>says</b> that the US will tax Australian residents at the rate of 5%, and Australia will tax it at normal rates (i.e., 30% for companies) but give a credit for the 5% already paid.

5000|$|Among {{the many}} closely watched {{decisions}} during Rehnquist's tenure was Romer v. Evans (1996). Colorado had adopted {{an amendment to}} the state constitution ("Amendment 2") that the Court majority said would have prevented any city, town, or county in the state from taking any legislative, executive, or judicial action to protect homosexual citizens from {{discrimination on the basis of}} their sexual orientation. Rehnquist joined the dissent, which argued that the Constitution of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>says</b> nothing about this subject, so [...] "it is left to be resolved by normal democratic means". The dissent, written by Justice Scalia, argued as follows (some punctuation omitted): [...] General laws and policies that prohibit arbitrary discrimination would continue to prohibit discrimination on the basis of homosexual conduct as well. This ... lays to rest such horribles, raised in the course of oral argument, as the prospect that assaults upon homosexuals could not be prosecuted. The amendment prohibits special treatment of homosexuals, and nothing more. It would not affect, for example, a requirement of state law that pensions be paid to all retiring state employees with a certain length of service; homosexual employees, as well as others, would be entitled to that benefit.|$|E
