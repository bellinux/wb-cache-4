5|$|Construction of <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> City Expressway {{started in}} the summer of 1962.

The portion between Route 42 in Turnersville and the Garden State Parkway in Egg Harbor Township was completed on July 31, 1964, and the portion between the Garden State Parkway and Atlantic City was finished in July 1965. Construction of <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> City Expressway cost a total of $48.2 million. Tolls on <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> City Expressway initially cost $0.75 at the Egg Harbor toll plaza and $0.15 at the Pleasantville toll plaza.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, <b>the</b> North <b>Atlantic</b> Treaty Organization (NATO) decided to {{establish}} a new major command, Allied Command <b>Atlantic,</b> under <b>the</b> command of a U.S. four-star admiral with headquarters in Norfolk, VA. Since this was primarily a naval command responsible for allied defense of <b>the</b> North <b>Atlantic,</b> <b>the</b> decision was made to co-locate this organization with that of <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Atlantic</b> Command and U.S. Atlantic Fleet, to form a triple-hatted command. On April 10, 1952, Admiral Lynde D. McCormick, <b>the</b> Commander-in-Chief, U.S. <b>Atlantic</b> Command and U.S. <b>Atlantic</b> Fleet, assumed <b>the</b> additional title as the first Supreme Allied Commander <b>Atlantic.</b> Like <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Atlantic</b> Command, <b>the</b> Allied Command <b>Atlantic</b> remained intact and part of a triple-hatted command organization until the Goldwater-Nichols Act occurred in 1985.

40|$|<b>The</b> North <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation is <b>the</b> {{dominant}} mode of winter climate {{variability in the}} Northern hemisphere. It is a complex 'see-saw' between two pressure systems located over Greenland {{and a group of}} Islands known as the Azores. <b>The</b> North <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation is most pronounced during the winter season and accounts for more than one third of the total variance in sea level pressure. <b>The</b> North <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation is closely related to the position of the storm track. During a positive phase of <b>the</b> North <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation <b>the</b> average storm track moves across <b>the</b> North <b>Atlantic</b> in a North Easterly direction towards Europe and the United Kingdom, During a negative phase of <b>the</b> North <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation, <b>the</b> storm track moves in a West to East direction towards Southern Europe.
