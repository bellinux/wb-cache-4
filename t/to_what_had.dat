5|$|Incorrect {{unloading}} sequences and ballasting {{which resulted}} in the buoyancy of the hull becoming uneven and the hull therefore strained: Lack of crew training or knowing malpractice were possible explanations. Total was held largely to blame for this. However, given that all the personnel involved in the unloading had died in the explosion, it was difficult to be certain as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened.|$|E
5|$|Shapley's {{measurements}} {{also indicated}} that the Sun is relatively far {{from the center of}} the galaxy, also contrary <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> previously been inferred from the apparently nearly even distribution of ordinary stars. In reality, most ordinary stars lie within the galaxy's disk and those stars that lie in the direction of the galactic centre and beyond are thus obscured by gas and dust, whereas globular clusters lie outside the disk and can be seen at much further distances.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} explosion, Thompson was {{informed}} by an Iowa crewman that the Navy was conducting a dishonest {{investigation into the}} cause of the tragedy. Thompson, a producer for the television newsmagazine 60 Minutes, later produced several television reports which disputed the Navy's conclusions as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> caused the explosion.|$|E

5|$|With {{the start}} of {{military}} operations in Croatia, Croats {{and a number of}} Serbian conscripts started to desert the JNA en masse, similar <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened in Slovenia. Albanians and Macedonians started to search for a way to legally leave the JNA or serve their conscription term in Macedonia; these moves further homogenized the ethnic composition of JNA troops in or near Croatia.|$|E
5|$|A second {{hindrance}} to Sicilian architects' fully achieving {{their potential}} earlier was that frequently {{they were only}} rebuilding a damaged structure, {{and as a consequence}} having to match their designs <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> been before, or remained. The Cathedral of San Giorgio at Modica (Illustration 10) is an example. It was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1613, rebuilt in 1643 in a Baroque style while keeping the medieval layout, then damaged again in 1693. Rebuilding again began in 1702, by an unknown architect. Finally, Rosario Gagliardi oversaw the façade's completion in 1760, but the compromises he had to make in deference to the existing structure are obvious. While Gagliardi used the same formulae he used so successfully at the church of San Giorgio in Ragusa, here in Modica the building is heavier, and lacks his usual lightness of touch and freedom of design.|$|E
5|$|The Liverpool badge {{is based}} on the city's liver bird, which in the past had been placed inside a shield. In 1992, to commemorate the centennial of the club, a new badge was commissioned, {{including}} a representation of the Shankly Gates. The next year twin flames were added at either side, symbolic of the Hillsborough memorial outside Anfield, where an eternal flame burns in memory of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster. In 2012, Warrior Sports' first Liverpool kit removed the shield and gates, returning the badge <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> adorned Liverpool shirts in the 1970s; the flames were moved to the back collar of the shirt, surrounding the number 96 for the number who died at Hillsborough.|$|E

5|$|The papal {{conclave}} {{that had}} elected Innocent XIII in 1721 {{was dominated by}} cardinals appointed by Clement XI, who had been Pope for 21 years and appointed over 70 cardinals during that time. The conclave that elected Innocent was marked by a new alliance between the French and Spanish cardinals due {{to a change in}} the Spanish dynasty following the War of the Spanish Succession that resulted in Philip V, a Bourbon and the grandson of Louis XIV of France, ascending <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> previously been a Habsburg throne. Innocent was elected unanimously with the prospect that he might cooperate with both Bourbon France and the Hapbsurg Holy Roman Emperor. Innocent had been in poor health for the year before his death on 7 March 1724 and preparations for the conclave to elect his successor had begun before his death.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also saw}} the {{planning}} and construction of additional junctions with new major roads in Perth. At Armadale, Armadale Road would connect <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> been a three-way junction with South Western Highway, while a highway deviation was proposed to connect to the extension of Roe Highway through Beckenham. The proposed deviation became Kenwick Link, constructed {{as part of the}} Roe Highway extension towards Fremantle. It was initially built as a single carriageway, and upgraded to a dual carriageway later. It opened on 17 April 1998, ahead of the Roe Highway extensions from Welshpool Road to Kenwick Link (opened 30 November 2002) and from Kenwick Link to Nicholson Road (opened 21 January 2003).|$|E
5|$|While {{the band}} was {{recording}} the new album and touring in the UK, their managers at HEC Enterprises had found an agreement for Deep Purple to support the Rolling Stones in their upcoming US tour during Spring 1969, the first in three years and a certain sold-out event. Unfortunately, the Rolling Stones decided {{to spend more time}} at Olympic Studios in London to record their album Let It Bleed and postponed their tour. Thus, in early April 1969 Deep Purple were on their way back to the US to start off a two-month coast-to-coast tour as headliners which, similarly <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened in Britain, brought them mainly to small clubs and colleges. This time their trek also touched Canada, where their albums were distributed by Polydor Records.|$|E

25|$|One {{component}} of Aristotle's theory of dreams introduces {{ideas that are}} contradictory to previously held beliefs.

Aristotle reasoned that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are happenstances not divinations. These ideas were contradictory <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> been believed about dreams, but at the time in which he introduced these ideas more thinkers were beginning to give naturalistic as opposed to supernatural explanations to phenomena.|$|E
