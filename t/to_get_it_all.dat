2500|$|Adam Gopnik of The New Yorker {{evaluated}} Updike as [...] "the first American writer since Henry James to {{get himself}} fully expressed, the man who broke the curse of incompleteness that had haunted American writing... He sang like Henry James, but he saw like Sinclair Lewis. The two sides of American fiction—the precise, realist, encyclopedic appetite <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> in, and the exquisite urge to make writing out of sensation rendered exactly—were both alive in him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the September 2014 issue of Paper, Love stated that a reunion of the band in 2015 was likely. In an earlier interview, Erlandson stated: [...] "I've also been doing research for a Hole box set that I'd like to finish as soon as possible. I have tapes galore that need to be digitized. I may have to do the dreaded [...] "kickstarter" [...] campaign <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> done. It's not easy listening back to old Hole rehearsals. Lemme tellya. The screaming, the anguish, the F-C-G chords over and over again like some sick folk loop." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A {{few months}} before you were born--on her trip to Australia--at Mola or Molo {{something}} or other. It took me three evenings <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> out.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was rather}} angry for a moment. Then {{he looked at}} the sky shining beyond the tower of the public baths, and he seemed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> over <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> He laughed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I seem <b>to</b> be <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> round, Mr. Westover," [...] said Jeff. [...] "This {{must make}} you feel good. I don't know but I begin to believe there's a God in Israel, myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Lady Franks, [...] "I {{had such}} a dreadful dream last night, such a dreadful dream. It upset me so much. I {{have not been able}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> over <b>it</b> <b>all</b> day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I suppose I must do it, though I {{would much}} rather not. Still, as you say, it were best <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> over at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But we don't have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> at once, Aunt Matilda," [...] said Harry, laughing; [...] "and you needn't {{be afraid}} that we can't do it. Come, Kate, it's {{time for us}} to be off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} leave it alone. I mayn't be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> but I'll {{do my best}} to secure a part of it. If any is to go, it had better be the land in Bostock and Twining. I think we could manage to keep Newton entire." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jojo {{is planned}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married but <b>it</b> <b>all</b> turns out {{bad in the}} end when she gets dumped.|$|R
50|$|If {{you have}} to {{multiply}} an agent <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> cancel, <b>all</b> other agents and ΔH must also be multiplied by that number.|$|R
6000|$|Gertie: [...] "Yes, isn't she, mamma.... Well, I {{was just}} saying: {{between you and}} me, Carl, she {{is to have the}} {{position}} in Fargo all ready and waiting for her, though of course they can't announce <b>it</b> publicly, with <b>all</b> the cats that would like <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it,</b> and <b>all.</b> Isn't that fine?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{need not}} say that my task does not end there. It would be {{comparatively}} easy if it did. There is much more before me. I have hills far steeper to climb, valleys much darker to pass through. And I have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> out of myself. Neither religion, morality, nor reason can help me at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "After all, my most {{peaceful}} {{times of}} late {{have been in}} walking about in those woods at Sirenwood; I should like to live there. You know he always wished {{it to be the}} purchase, because it joins Compton, and I should like <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> into perfect order and beauty, and leave it all to little Raymond." ...|$|E
60|$|Well now, I {{could not}} pass over my boyhood without {{telling you about}} this, which was the most {{important}} thing that happened to me. But I will go off upon no more side tracks; for when I think of all that is coming, I can see very well that I shall have more than enough to do before I have finished. For when a man has only his own little private tale to tell, it often takes him all his time; but when he gets mixed up in such great matters as I shall have to speak about, then it is hard on him, if he has not been brought up to it, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> set down to his liking. But my memory is as good as ever, thank God, and I shall try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> straight before I finish.|$|E
5000|$|... "Tired of the {{everyday}} grind? Ever dream of a life of romantic adventure? Want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from <b>it</b> <b>all?</b> We offer you... Escape!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Leave him to me,' {{says another}} member of the committee, with a {{significant}} look. 'I know how <b>to</b> <b>get</b> round him. <b>It's</b> <b>all</b> right.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll take {{it clean}} out, sir,' replied the man, winking to the company, 'before {{you can come}} across the room <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it.</b> Gentlemen <b>all,</b> observe the dark stain upon this gentleman's hat, no wider than a shilling, but thicker than a half-crown. Whether it is a wine-stain, fruit-stain, beer-stain, water-stain, paint-stain, pitch-stain, mud-stain, or blood-stain--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} must, Bullen. When a man {{performs}} brave deeds, {{he must be}} expected to be patted on the back--metaphorically, at any rate--by the ladies. So you have got to go through it all and, as I have sent word round that I shall bring you to my bungalow, you will be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> over at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} was quite right {{for you to do}} so, Mr. Popham, but you see I am quite unaccustomed to such things, and would {{personally}} have been much more pleased to have come home quietly. Still, as you say, it is only right that the tenants should have been informed, and at any rate it will be a satisfaction <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> over at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He has {{to set out}} a {{glass of}} Burmese brandy, {{powdered}} over with nutmeg and aromatics," [...] whispered Mrs. Rasselyer-Brown. [...] "I had the greatest hunt <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> for him. He said that nothing but Burmese brandy would do, because in the Hindu religion the god can only be invoked with Burmese brandy, or, failing that, Hennessy's with three stars, which is not entirely displeasing to Buddha." ...|$|E
50|$|A fading rock singer goes to {{the beach}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from <b>it</b> <b>all</b> and winds up getting {{involved}} {{in the lives of}} the teenage beachgoers.|$|R

50|$|After a {{few hours}} spent on the crowded beaches, Daneel leads Sophie to an almost {{abandoned}} island lost in the Black Sea. Once there, Daneel discovers pregnancy tests in Sophie’s luggage. The heat and the strange few inhabitants soon alter their own behaviors, and the island slowly reveals hidden fears that question their love. <b>To</b> <b>get</b> through <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> they have {{to jump into the}} unknown...|$|R
60|$|Burns took {{a measure}} of salt and {{went out into the}} pasture to salt the cows. On the sunlit slope of the field, where the cattle came running and bawling to meet him, he threw down the salt in handfuls, and then lay down to watch them as they eagerly licked it up, even gnawing a bare spot in the sod in their eagerness <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll go myself," [...] said Cartwright [...] "If she can't be persuaded, I'll {{bring her}} by force. It's lucky I can charge {{the cost to}} the office. The new wheat is coming down to Montreal, and the Conference people have a plan <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> but I expect to beat them and engage some cargo for our boats before the St. Lawrence freezes. However, since I'm going, I must get to work." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. H. As it's {{the only}} person in he world you ever do think of, and as I know your mind thoroughly, I do. You want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> over and--Oh, I can't keep you back! And you're going--think of it, Pip--to throw me over for another woman. And you swore that all other women were--Pip, my Pip! She can't care for you as I do. Believe me, she can't. Is it any one that I know? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure I am," [...] she said. [...] "Make home-coming {{a change}} to him. As you said {{yourself}} the other evening. It's {{good for him}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> now and then." ...|$|R
60|$|Now {{his mother}} was very sorrowful when she heard of this, but she knew quite well that if she tried to stop his having his own way he would only grow more {{determined}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it.</b> So <b>all</b> the answer she made was {{that the end of}} thieves was hanging at the bridge of Dublin, and then she left him alone, hoping that when he was older he might become more sensible.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{was really}} happy when I wrote this and when I'm {{in that kind}} of mood I always hope {{everyone}} else feels the same way. Everybody is looking for the same thing - to love someone and be loved back. Or just <b>to</b> <b>get</b> laid. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> depends on how you look for it. 'Love Today' captures that, the euphoric feeling you get when those things go right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True, boy, but it's {{not so easy}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> off yer stomach sometimes. What with {{confinement}} {{and want}} of exercise we was troubled with indigestion at first, but we're used to it now, and I have acquired quite a fancy for cooking. No doubt you'll hear Forsyth and Joe say that I've half-pisoned them four or five times, but that's all envy; besides, a feller can't learn a trade without doin' a little damage to somebody or something at first. Did you ever taste blackbird pie?" ...|$|E
60|$|Sept. 5. Closing in on {{the equator}} this noon. A sailor {{explained}} to a young girl that the ship's speed is poor because we are climbing up the bulge {{toward the center of}} the globe; but that when we should once get over, at the equator, and start down-hill, we should fly. When she asked him the other day what the fore-yard was, he said it was the front yard, the open area in the front end of the ship. That man has a good deal of learning stored up, and the girl is likely <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'A {{flash of}} faded {{lightning}} darted {{in through the}} black framework of the windows and ebbed out without any noise. I was thinking how I had best approach him (I {{did not want to}} be flung off again) when he gave a little laugh. [...] "No better than a vagabond now" [...] . the end of the cigarette smouldered between his fingers [...] "without a single--single," [...] he pronounced slowly; [...] "and yet [...] ." [...] He paused; the rain fell with redoubled violence. [...] "Some day one's bound to come upon some sort of chance <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> back again. Must!"

6000|$|... 'Lor,' cried Mrs Boffin, looking radiantly about her, 'we {{want to make}} {{everybody}} happy, not dismal!--And perhaps you wouldn't mind letting me know how used to <b>it</b> you begin <b>to</b> <b>get,</b> and how <b>it</b> <b>all</b> goes on?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Cornell Woolrich {{disliked the}} film version of his novel. Woolrich saw the film at the urging of Mark Van Doren, a Columbia University professor, and hated it. He wrote to Van Doren in 1947: [...] "I was so ashamed when I came out of there ... it took me two or three days <b>to</b> <b>get</b> over <b>it.</b> <b>All</b> I could keep {{thinking}} of in the dark was: Is that what I wasted my whole life at?" ...|$|R
