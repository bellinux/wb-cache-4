5|$|Further north, {{the missing}} {{men of the}} 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion were still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> brigade area. The smaller group {{commanded}} by the battalion intelligence officer observed a German convoy heading south towards Le Muy. They quickly set up an ambush and destroyed several vehicles before being forced to withdraw into the hills by the stronger German force.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} six crew members, {{a total of}} 160 {{passengers}} were on board {{at the time of}} the crash. Although there were 169 names on the original passenger list, nine did not board the flight. All the bodies were recovered from the wreckage. Karnataka Home Minister V. S. Acharya said eight people were initially reported to have survived, although one person died of his injuries—this was however refuted by an Air India spokesman who confirmed that all initial survivors were alive. This confusion arose after fire fighters rescued a little girl who died on the way to hospital. The airport manager at Mangalore, Peter Abraham confirmed that there were difficulties when <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> plane.|$|E

He is left standing on the platform without any fixed points in his life, with nothing but a life of emptiness stretching out before him.|$|E
5|$|Bitter, {{confused}} fighting continued {{behind the}} 35th Infantry's {{line for the}} next week. Battalions, companies, and platoons, cut off and isolated, fought independently of higher control and help except for airdrops which supplied many of them. Airdrops also supplied relief forces <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> front-line units. Tanks and armored cars drove to the isolated units with supplies of food and ammunition and carried back critically wounded on the return trips. In general, the 35th Infantry fought in its original battle line positions, while at first one battalion, and later two battalions, of the 27th Infantry fought toward it through the estimated 3,000 North Koreans operating in its rear areas.|$|E

But when the 15th Regiment was about to cross the river, the PVA 120th Division intercepted the South Koreans with heavy artillery fire. The South Koreans first believed the resistance {{to be the last}} remnants of the KPA, but the perception soon changed with the capture of the first Chinese prisoner in the Korean War. The prisoner revealed that there were 10,000 Chinese soldiers waiting to join the fight north of Unsan.|$|E

5|$|In March 1695, captain Juan Díaz de Velasco set {{out from}} Cahabón in Alta Verapaz with 70 Spanish soldiers, {{accompanied}} by {{a large number of}} Maya archers from Verapaz, and native muleteers; four Dominican friars led by Criollo friar Agustín Cano accompanied the expedition. Theoretically the Spanish soldiers were provided solely as an escort for the Dominicans. The Guatemalan expedition, under orders of President Jacinto de Barrios Leal, were secretly <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> Itzas before Martín de Ursúa could reach them from Yucatán; the existence of the expedition was carefully concealed during all communications between Guatemala and the governor of Yucatán. It formed a part of a three-pronged attack against the independent inhabitants of Petén and neighbouring Chiapas; the other two expeditions were launched against the Lakandon.|$|E
5|$|Konami, who had {{distributed}} the original Q*bert to Japanese arcades in 1983, produced {{a game with}} the title Q*bert for MSX computers in 1986, released in Japan and Europe. However, the main character is a little dragon, and the mechanics are based on Q*bert's Qubes. The player once again turns around colored cubes by jumping from cube to cube, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> displayed target pattern. Contrary to Mylstar's arcade game, each of the 50 stages has a different pattern of cubes, {{in addition to the}} known rule extensions in later stages. The game also features a competitive 2-player mode, where each side is assigned a different pattern, and the players can score points either by completing their pattern first, or by pushing the other off the board.|$|E
5|$|Blythe, who is nearsighted, {{took off}} his glasses before {{entering}} the stage, which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half-blind. Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage. One of the fans, who was identified as Milan Pořádek by Czech newspapers, and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings, managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security. Blythe testified that during the first attempt, Pořádek rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving. The second time, he tried to {{put his arms around}} Blythe in an attempt to hug him. Blythe, who according to his own words perceived this as a danger, caught Pořádek's collar, pushed him on the ground, knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop. He then led the fan by his hair {{to the edge of the}} stage, where the fan jumped off. It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back. Blythe further said that he saw Pořádek <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> stage yet again before finally being stopped by security.|$|E

5|$|It {{begins with}} a young girl playing in the {{backyard}} as snow falls on the ground. The scene shifts {{to that of a}} bedside, where a young woman who has died, lies. Her husband covers her with a white sheet as a priest prays. Madonna, wearing a long, black coat, sings the song underneath a snow-covered, dead tree, as the young girl plays with her dead mother's jewelry. The husband comes and shouts at the girl, tearing away the woman's pearl necklace which drop at the little girl's feet. The adult Madonna is shown lying beside another man singing the song as the little girl visits her mother's grave. The man gets up and slaps Madonna in the face, as the little girl cries in front of the grave. She is taken away from the graveyard by her father, as interspersed scenes show the girl being kissed by her mother, her <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> knob of a door, and Madonna powdering the bruise mark on her face.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation by}} the FBI was aided by another prisoner, Allen West, {{who was part of}} the escapees' group but was left behind. West's false wall kept slipping so he held it in place with cement, which set. When Morris and the Anglins accelerated the schedule, West desperately chipped away at the wall, {{but by the time he}} got out, his companions were gone. Articles belonging to the prisoners, including plywood paddles and parts of the raincoat raft were discovered on nearby Angel Island. The FBI's investigation from 1962 to December 1979 was finally treated as closed. The official report on the escape concludes that the prisoners drowned in the cold waters of the bay while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> mainland, it being unlikely that they made it the 1.25 miles to shore due to the strong ocean currents and the cold sea water temperatures ranging between 50 and 55 degrees Fahrenheit.|$|E

25|$|On June 6, 2007, Bork {{filed suit}} {{in federal court in}} New York City against the Yale Club over an {{incident}} that had occurred a year earlier.

(After his fall, he successfully climbed to the dais and delivered his speech.) According to the complaint, Bork's injuries required surgery, immobilized him for months, forced him to use a cane, and left him with a limp. In May 2008, Bork and the Yale Club reached a confidential, out-of-court settlement.|$|E

25|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744 - 1829) was {{the first}} {{biologist}} to describe a complex theory of evolution. His theory substantially comprised two statements: first, that animal organs and behaviour can change according {{to the way they}} are used; and second, that those characteristics can transmit {{from one generation to the}} next (the example of the giraffe whose neck becomes longer while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> upper leaves of a tree is well-known). The second statement is that every living organism, humans included, tends to reach a greater level of perfection. When Charles Darwin went to the Galápagos Islands, he was well aware of Lamarck's theories and was influenced by them.|$|E
25|$|Nazi Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939 and the German 1st Mountain Division {{reached the}} suburbs of Lviv on September 12 and began a siege. The city's {{garrison}} was ordered to hold out at all cost since the strategic position prevented the enemy from crossing into the Romanian Bridgehead. Also, a number of Polish troops from Central Poland were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> city and organise a defence there to buy time to regroup. Thus a 10-day-long defence of the city started and later became known as yet another Battle of Lwów. On September 19 an unsuccessful Polish diversionary attack under General Władysław Langner was launched. Soviet troops (part of the forces which had invaded on September 17 under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact) replaced the Germans around the city. On September 21 Langner formally surrendered to Soviet troops under Marshal Semyon Timoshenko.|$|E
25|$|Express {{was laid}} down on at Laird's Birkenhead {{shipyard}} on 1 December 1896 as Yard number 629, and was launched on 11 December 1897. Express {{was subject to}} an extensive series of trials over an 18-month period {{in an attempt to}} reach the contracted speed of 33 knots. Although Lairds managed to drive the ship's machinery to up to , well in excess of the rated , and experimented with different propellers, Express failed to reach the required speeds. It was eventually decided by the Admiralty to accept Express despite this failure in recognition of Laird's great efforts and expense in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> over-optimistic requirement, and the fact that forcing the ship's machinery further was likely to cause excessive wear. Express was delivered to Devonport for further trials in August 1902, and eventually commissioned later that year.|$|E
