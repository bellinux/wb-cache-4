The award is named after former collegiate and Major League Baseball (MLB) player and manager Dick Howser, who died of brain cancer in 1987 {{at the age of}} 51.

5000|$|In 2001, Dick's was {{acquired}} by Piggly Wiggly. Dick's continued to operate under <b>the</b> <b>Dick's</b> name until 2006, when they were briefly rebranded as [...] "Dick's Piggly Wiggly", featuring the Piggly Wiggly logo with a small rendition of <b>the</b> <b>Dick's</b> logo above and to the left. However, <b>the</b> <b>Dick's</b> brand has since been scrapped entirely, and all former Dick's locations still in operation are now simply Piggly Wiggly.|$|R
50|$|The {{hardcore}} punk style, {{a development}} {{from the earlier}} punk sound, arose spontaneously in various cities, but in Austin it was represented by MDC, Big Boys, The Huns, The Skunks and <b>The</b> <b>Dicks.</b> <b>The</b> bands often played together; Big Boys and <b>The</b> <b>Dicks</b> jointly released a split single and an LP, Live At Raul's.|$|R

He won <b>the</b> <b>Dick</b> Howser Trophy as college baseball's {{best player in}} 1998, and set Southeastern Conference (SEC) records in numerous offensive categories, including home runs and runs batted in (RBIs). He was among the National Collegiate Athletic Association's all-time leaders in home runs and RBIs {{at the time he}} graduated from college.|$|E
5|$|Batman Forevers tone is {{significantly}} different from the previous installments, becoming more family-friendly since Warner Bros. believed that the previous Batman film, Batman Returns (1992), failed to outgross its predecessor due to parent complaints about the film's violence and dark overtones. Schumacher eschewed the dark, dystopian atmosphere of Burton's films by drawing inspiration from the Batman comic book of <b>the</b> <b>Dick</b> Sprang era, as well as the 1960s television series. Keaton chose not to reprise the role due to Burton stepping down as director. William Baldwin and Ethan Hawke were initially considered for Keaton's replacement before Kilmer joined the cast.|$|E
50|$|These People is {{the second}} and last studio album by the American punk band <b>The</b> <b>Dicks,</b> {{released}} in 1985 on Alternative Tentacles. By the time this record was recorded, <b>The</b> <b>Dicks</b> had changed half of their lineup, and relocated from Texas to San Francisco.|$|R

5|$|Dick Tracy was {{released}} in 1990 to mixed reviews, but was a success {{at the box office}} and at awards time. It picked up seven Academy Award nominations and won in three of the categories: Best Original Song, Best Makeup and Best Art Direction. A sequel was planned, but a controversy over the film rights ensued between Beatty and Tribune Media Services. The lawsuit was resolved in Beatty's favor in October 2013. However, no plans for a sequel or follow-up have been publicly disclosed. Beatty created <b>The</b> <b>Dick</b> Tracy TV Special in 2008, which featured him reprising the character to be interviewed by film critic Leonard Maltin.|$|E
5|$|Humber {{finished}} his three-year career with a 35–8 win–loss record and 2.80 ERA, striking out 422 in 354 innings pitched. Humber's totals rank {{him with the}} third most wins in Rice baseball history and second most strikeouts. Among his honors for the season were selection to the 2004 Louisville Slugger All-America team by Collegiate Baseball and the 2004 USA TODAY/Sports Weekly All-America team. During the inaugural year for the Roger Clemens Award, which designates the top college pitcher, {{he was one of}} 10 named semifinalists. He was also among the 10 finalists for <b>the</b> <b>Dick</b> Howser Trophy in 2004, in recognition of his performance as one of college baseball's top players.|$|E
5|$|Inon Zur {{was born}} in Israel. At the age of five, {{he was trying to}} compose harmonies with his mother's singing, and became {{inspired}} by classical music. He learned to play french horn as a child, studied piano by the age of eight, and was studying composition by the age of ten. He graduated from the Music Academy of Tel Aviv, and spent four years in the Israeli military. He emigrated to the United States in 1990 to study at <b>the</b> <b>Dick</b> Grove School of Music for a year, and then under private tutor Jack Smalley, a television music composer, and others for two years at the University of California, Los Angeles.|$|E

5|$|Shaw is commemorated in Kilmarnock {{town centre}} by {{a statue of}} Carrara marble, about 17 feet tall, on a base of Aberdeen granite, {{executed}} by sculptor James Fillans (1808–52). The cost was defrayed by public subscription, which raised almost £1000. It was unveiled on 4 August 1848 and was originally located at the Kilmarnock Cross. On 28 March 1929 the statue {{was moved to the}} area of <b>The</b> <b>Dick</b> Institute just off the London Road because of the increase in traffic around the centre of the town.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Redding's departure, Hendrix began lodging at the eight-bedroom Ashokan House, in {{the hamlet}} of Boiceville near Woodstock in upstate New York, {{where he had}} spent some time vacationing in mid-1969. Manager Michael Jeffery {{arranged}} the accommodations {{in the hope that}} the respite might encourage Hendrix to write material for a new album. During this time, Mitchell was unavailable for commitments made by Jeffery, which included Hendrix's first appearance on U.S. TV—on <b>The</b> <b>Dick</b> Cavett Show—where he was backed by the studio orchestra, and an appearance on The Tonight Show where he appeared with Cox and session drummer Ed Shaughnessy.|$|E
5|$|Strasburg {{finished}} his junior year, the 2009 season, 13–1 with a 1.32 ERA, 59 hits allowed, 16 earned runs, 19 walks, and 195 strikeouts in 109 innings pitched. In his final home start on May 8, 2009, Strasburg threw his first career no-hitter while striking out 17 Air Force Falcons batters.

5|$|Terrapins {{have won}} several nationally {{recognized}} individual awards, including the Chuck Bednarik Award, <b>the</b> <b>Dick</b> Butkus Award, the Lombardi Award, and the Outland Trophy, {{each of which}} recognizes the best player at a particular position in a given season. The College Football Hall of Fame has inducted six former Maryland players, and the Pro Football Hall of Fame has enshrined two. Four former Maryland head coaches have also been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. The University of Maryland Athletic Hall of Fame has inducted sixty-two former football lettermen and two former head coaches who were not alumni.|$|E
5|$|Hepburn {{was known}} for being {{fiercely}} private, and would not give interviews or talk to fans for much of her career. She distanced herself from the celebrity lifestyle, uninterested in a social scene she saw as tedious and superficial, and she wore casual clothes that went strongly against convention {{in an era of}} glamour. She rarely appeared in public, even avoiding restaurants, and once wrestled a camera out of a photographer's hand when he took a picture without asking. Despite her zeal for privacy, she enjoyed her fame, and later confessed that she would not have liked the press to ignore her completely. The protective attitude thawed as she aged; beginning with a two-hour-long interview on <b>The</b> <b>Dick</b> Cavett Show in 1973, Hepburn became increasingly open with the public.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with The Sporting News in August 1951, Chandler cited his decision to void a trade between the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox for outfielder Dick Wakefield as {{a major factor in}} his inability to secure a new contract. The Yankees traded Wakefield to the White Sox for cash, but Wakefield refused to report to the White Sox after a salary dispute, leading to a disagreement between the teams over who was responsible for his salary. Chandler voided the trade, making Wakefield's contract the Yankees' responsibility and angering their owner, Del Webb. It was not until the 1970s that Chandler began to cite his involvement in the integration of baseball as a reason for his contract not being renewed. Historian John Paul Hill considers this unlikely, however, because two of Chandler's strongest allies, Connie Mack and Walter Briggs, Sr., were ardently opposed to integration while William DeWitt, the second owner in the American League to integrate, voted against him. Hill points to <b>the</b> <b>Dick</b> Wakefield dispute, as well as Chandler's investigations of Del Webb and Cardinals owner Fred Saigh involving their rumored connections to gambling interests, as more compelling reasons for Chandler's dismissal.|$|E

50|$|On the October 28 {{episode of}} SmackDown, <b>The</b> <b>Dicks</b> {{appeared}} once again, helping MNM capture the WWE Tag Team Championship when they attacked Heidenreich before Paul Burchill {{was about to}} receive the Doomsday Device finisher. This began a brawl with all the teams as <b>the</b> <b>Dicks</b> began attacking Road Warrior Animal. This allowed MNM to hit the Snapshot on Heidenreich and win the title.|$|R
5000|$|Dick's Picks Volume 4 is {{the fourth}} live album in <b>the</b> <b>Dick's</b> Picks series of {{releases}} by the Grateful Dead. It was recorded on February 13 and February 14, 1970 at the Fillmore East in New York City, and released in February 1996. It {{was the first of}} <b>the</b> <b>Dick's</b> Picks CDs to have three discs. It was also the first Dead album to include the song [...] "Mason's Children".|$|R
5|$|Ten {{winners of}} the Golden Spikes Award {{are members of the}} National College Baseball Hall of Fame, {{including}} Bob Horner, the inaugural winner in 1978. In that same year, he was the first overall MLB draft pick and proceeded to win the Rookie of the Year Award. Seven Golden Spikes Award winners {{went on to become the}} first overall draft pick. Only Horner achieved the Rookie of the Year Award in the same year (although Jason Jennings and Buster Posey were voted the top rookies of the National League several years after winning the Golden Spikes Award). Jim Abbott, Jered Weaver and Tim Lincecum are the only award winners to pitch a no-hitter, while Horner is the only one to hit four home runs in one game. Furthermore, 17 players won <b>the</b> <b>Dick</b> Howser Trophy (considered to be the Heisman Trophy of college baseball) alongside the Golden Spikes Award. No player has won the award more than once.|$|E
5|$|Various {{organizations}} bestow awards {{recognizing the}} best player overall or at a specific position, {{and some of these}} annual awards are considered highly prestigious honors. All of the following individual awards bestowed upon Terrapins have gone to linemen and defensive players. In 1952, tackle Dick Modzelewski was awarded the Outland Trophy, for best interior lineman, and the Touchdown Club's Knute Rockne Award for best lineman. The following year, Stan Jones won the Knute Rockne Award. In 1955, the Touchdown Club bestowed its Walter Camp Memorial Trophy, for best player, and Knute Rockne Award, for best lineman, upon center Bob Pellegrini, who was also named the Lineman of the Year by United Press International (UPI). In 1974, Randy White won the Lombardi Award, for best lineman or linebacker; the Outland Trophy, for best interior lineman; and was named the UPI Lineman of the Year. In 2002, E. J. Henderson received the Chuck Bednarik Award, for best linebacker, and <b>the</b> <b>Dick</b> Butkus Award for best lineman or linebacker.|$|E
5|$|With few exceptions, Hendrix played {{right-handed}} guitars {{that were}} {{turned upside down}} and restrung for left-hand playing. This had an important effect on {{the sound of his}} guitar; because of the slant of the bridge pickup, his lowest string had a brighter sound while his highest string had a darker sound, which was the opposite of the Stratocaster's intended design. In addition to Stratocasters, Hendrix also used Fender Jazzmasters, Duosonics, two different Gibson Flying Vs, a Gibson Les Paul, three Gibson SGs, a Gretsch Corvette, and a Fender Jaguar. He used a white Gibson SG Custom for his performances on <b>The</b> <b>Dick</b> Cavett Show in September 1969, and a black Gibson Flying V during the Isle of Wight festival in 1970.|$|E
