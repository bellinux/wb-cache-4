We have identified and characterized a population of fetally developed CD 4 T cells with an effector memory phenotype (TEM), which are present in cord blood. This population is polyclonal and has phenotypic features similar to those of conventional adult memory T cells, such as CD 45 RO expression. These cells express low levels of CD 25 but are distinct from regulatory T cells because they lack Foxp 3 expression. After T cell receptor activation, neonatal <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> readily produced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). We also detected interferon-γ (IFN-γ) -producing T helper 1 (TH 1) cells and interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) /IL- 13 -producing TH 2 -like cells, but not IL- 17 -producing cells. We used chemokine receptor expression patterns to divide this TEM population into different subsets and identified distinct transcriptional programs using whole-genome microarray analysis. IFN-γ was found in CXCR 3 (+) <b>TEM</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas IL- 4 was found in both CXCR 3 (+) <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> and CCR 4 (+) <b>TEM</b> <b>cells.</b> CCR 6 (+) <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> displayed a genetic signature that corresponded to TH 17 cells but failed to produce IL- 17 A.

40|$|In {{order to}} test the {{hypothesis}} that Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is associated with an ongoing immune effector response, even in remission, we examined the distribution of peripheral naive and memory T-lymphocytes in this disease, and analyzed the function-related phenotypes of the memory T-cell population. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were freshly isolated from WG-patients in remission (R-WG, n = 40), active WG-patients (A-WG, n = 17), and age-matched healthy controls (HCs, n 21). Expression of CD 4, CD 8, CD 45 RO, CCR 7, interleukin (IL) - 18 R alpha, ST 2 L, and FoxP 3 were determined by four-color flow cytometric analysis. CD 45 RO and CCR 7 were used for distinction between naive and memory T cells, IL- 18 R alpha, ST 2 L, and FoxP 3 for the assessment of Type 1, Type 2, and regulatory T-cells, respectively. In R-WG, the CD 4 (+) CD 45 RO(+) CCR 7 (-) effector memory T-cell subpopulation (T-EM) was relatively increased, whereas the CD 4 (+) CD 45 RO(-) CCR 7 (+) naive T-cell population (T-Naive) was decreased as compared to HC. The distribution of naive and memory CD 8 (+) T cells did not differ between R-WG, A-WG, and HC, nor did CD 4 (+) CD 45 RO(+) CCR 7 (+) central memory T cells (T-CM). In contrast to HC, the percentage of CD 4 (+) T(Naive) cells in R-WG correlated negatively with age, whereas CD 4 (+) <b>T(EM)</b> <b>cells</b> showed a positive correlation.

40|$|Through a {{combination}} of fluorescence microscopy and patch-clamp analysis we have identified a striking alteration in K+ channel expression in terminally differentiated human CCR 7 –CD 45 RA– effector memory T lymphocytes (TEM). Following activation, <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> expressed {{significantly higher levels of}} the voltage-gated K+ channel Kv 1. 3 and lower levels of the calcium-activated K+ channel IKCa 1 than naive and central memory T cells (TCM). Upon repeated in vitro antigenic stimulation, naive cells differentiated into Kv 1. 3 highIKCa 1 low <b>TEM</b> <b>cells,</b> and the potent Kv 1. 3 -blocking sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus peptide (ShK) suppressed proliferation of <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> without affecting naive or TCM lymphocytes. Thus, the Kv 1. 3 highIKCa 1 low phenotype is a functional marker of activated TEM lymphocytes. Activated myelin-reactive T cells from patients with MS exhibited the Kv 1. 3 highIKCa 1 low TEM phenotype, suggesting that they have undergone repeated stimulation during the course of disease; these cells may contribute to disease pathogenesis due to their ability to home to inflamed tissues and exhibit immediate effector function. The Kv 1. 3 highIKCa 1 low phenotype was not seen in glutamic acid decarboxylase, insulin-peptide or ovalbumin-specific and mitogen-activated T cells from MS patients, or in myelin-specific T cells from healthy controls.

METHODS: Sixty-four patients {{were included in the}} study; HCV monoinfected (n = 21), HIV monoinfected (n = 23), HCV/HIV coinfected (n = 20), and healthy controls (n = 20). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated; immunophenotyped and functional assays were performed. RESULTS: A significant increase in the naive T cells and central memory T cells and a marked reduction in effector memory T <b>cells</b> (<b>TEM)</b> were observed with coinfection as compared to monoinfection. Inhibitory markers programmed death 1 (PD- 1) and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing molecule 3 (TIM 3) were highly upregulated on TEM in coinfection and functionally, these <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> displayed lowered proliferation. Increased expression of PD- 1 and TIM 3 correlated with decreased levels of CD 8 +CD 107 a+ <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> in coinfection. Pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) secretion by <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> were also reduced during chronic viral infection. Secretion of IL- 10, a human cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor, was significantly upregulated in CD 4 TEM with HCV/HIV coinfection in comparison to HCV monoinfection. CONCLUSION: <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> play an important role during viral infection and enhanced expression of inhibitory markers {{is associated with}} decreased proliferation and cytotoxicity and increased IL- 10 production, which was pronounced in HCV/HIV coinfection.

Eventually, persistent SIV replication results in chronic-phase AIDS, but the responsible mechanisms remain controversial.

The instability of effector site CD 4 + <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> populations over time was not explained by increasing destruction of these cells, but rather was attributable to progressive reduction in their production, secondary to decreasing numbers of CCR 5 − CD 4 + TCM cells.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the main features}} of the timedomain reflectometry (TDR) measurement technique and, in particular, the TDR analysis performed using a proper operating mode of the vector network analyzer (VNA), which is called synthetic TDR. Furthermore, some results of reflection measurement, which aim to characterize the impedance behavior of transverse electromagnetic (TEM) and gigahertz <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> {{by means of a}} commercial VNA in time-domain mode, are presented...|$|R
40|$|Optimization of {{the shape}} of the {{cross-section}} of <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> was already shown very effective in providing both field uniformity in large regions and compact dimensions. In this paper, surface charge densities on the inner conductor and electrode shape are investigated, in order to secure maximal fields not exceeding those provided by traditional design practices. The optimization scheme already proposed is retained, and refined electrode shapes are introduced in the procedure. Some results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Heterologous {{prime-boost}} vaccination using plasmid DNA {{followed by}} replication-defective adenovirus vector generates {{a large number}} of specific CD 8 (+) T effector memory (<b>TEM)</b> <b>cells</b> that provide long-term immunity against a variety of pathogens. in the present study, we initially characterized the frequency, phenotype, and function of these T cells in vaccinated mice that were subjected to infectious challenge with the human protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. We observed that the frequency of the specific CD 8 (+) T cells in the spleens of the vaccinated mice increased after challenge. Specific <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> differentiated into cells with a KLRG 1 (High) CD 27 (Low) CD 43 (Low) CD 183 (Low) T-bet(High) Eomes(Low) phenotype and capable to produce simultaneously the antiparasitic mediators IFN and TNF. Using the gzmBCreERT 2 /ROSA 26 EYFP transgenic mouse line, in which the cells that express Granzyme B after immunization, are indelibly labeled with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein, we confirmed that CD 8 (+) T cells present after challenge were indeed <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> that had been induced by vaccination. Subsequently, we observed that the in vivo increase in the frequency of the specific CD 8 (+) T cells was not because of an anamnestic immune response. Most importantly, after challenge, the increase in the frequency of specific cells and the protective immunity they mediate were insensitive to treatment with the cytostatic toxic agent hydroxyurea. We have previously described that the administration of the drug FTY 720, which reduces lymphocyte recirculation, severely impairs protective immunity, and our evidence supports the model that when large amounts of antigen-experienced CD 8 (+) <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> are present after heterologous prime-boost vaccination, differentiation, and recirculation, rather than proliferation, are key for the resultant protective immunity.
