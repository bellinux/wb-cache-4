5|$|An old {{qualitative}} {{test for}} the presence of the alkene functional group is that alkenes turn brown aqueous bromine solutions colourless, forming a bromohydrin with some of the dibromoalkane also produced. The reaction passes through a short-lived strongly electrophilic bromonium intermediate. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of a halogen addition reaction.|$|E
5|$|King {{vultures}}, which {{lack the}} ability to smell carrion, follow the greater yellow-headed vultures to carcasses, where the king vulture tears open {{the skin of the}} dead animal. This allows the smaller greater yellow-headed vulture access to food, as it does not have a bill strong enough to tear the hide of larger animals. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of mutual dependence between species. It is generally displaced from carcasses by both turkey vultures and king vultures, due to their larger size.|$|E
5|$|Ka is the {{dissociation}} constant of a substituted compound, K is the {{dissociation constant}} when the substituent is hydrogen, ρ is a {{property of the}} unsubstituted compound and σ has a particular value for each substituent. A plot of log(Ka) against σ is a straight line with intercept log(K) and slope ρ. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of a linear free energy relationship as log(Ka) {{is proportional to the}} standard fee energy change. Hammett originally formulated the relationship with data from benzoic acid with different substiuents in the ortho- and para- positions: some numerical values are in Hammett equation. This and other studies allowed substituents to be ordered according to their electron-withdrawing or electron-releasing power, and to distinguish between inductive and mesomeric effects.|$|E

5|$|Manasollasa or Abhilashitartha Chintamani by king Someshvara III (1129) was a Sanskrit work {{intended}} for all sections of society. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> {{of an early}} encyclopedia in Sanskrit covering many subjects including medicine, magic, veterinary science, valuing of precious stones and pearls, fortifications, painting, music, games, amusements etc. While the book does not give any of dealt topics particular hierarchy of importance, {{it serves as a}} landmark in understanding the state of knowledge in those subjects at that time. Someshwara III also authored a biography of his famous father Vikramaditya VI called Vikraman-Kabhyudaya. The text is a historical prose narrative which also includes a graphic description of the geography and people of Karnataka.|$|E
5|$|A bike is also {{an example}} of an {{inverted}} pendulum. Just as a broomstick is more easily balanced in the hand than a pencil, a tall bike (with a high center of mass) can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because the tall bike's lean rate (rate at which its angle of lean increases as it begins to fall over) will be slower. However, a rider can have the opposite impression of a bike when it is stationary. A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than a bike which is just as tall but with a lower center of mass. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of a vertical second-class lever. A small force {{at the end of the}} lever, the seat or handlebars at the top of the bike, more easily moves a large mass if the mass is closer to the fulcrum, where the tires touch the ground. This is why touring cyclists are advised to carry loads low on a bike, and panniers hang down on either side of front and rear racks.|$|E
5|$|In principle, {{an atomic}} {{structure}} could be determined from applying X-ray scattering to non-crystalline samples, {{even to a}} single molecule. However, crystals offer a much stronger signal due to their periodicity. A crystalline sample is by definition periodic; a crystal is composed of many unit cells repeated indefinitely in three independent directions. Such periodic systems have a Fourier transform that is concentrated at periodically repeating points in reciprocal space known as Bragg peaks; the Bragg peaks correspond to the reflection spots observed in the diffraction image. Since the amplitude at these reflections grows linearly with the number N of scatterers, the observed intensity of these spots should grow quadratically, like N2. In other words, using a crystal concentrates the weak scattering of the individual unit cells into a much more powerful, coherent reflection that can be observed above the noise. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of constructive interference.|$|E

5|$|Warfare was {{prevalent}} in the Maya world. Military campaigns were launched {{for a variety of}} reasons, including the control of trade routes and tribute, raids to take captives, scaling up to the complete destruction of an enemy state. Little is known about Maya military organization, logistics, or training. Warfare is depicted in Maya art from the Classic period, and wars and victories are mentioned in hieroglyphic inscriptions. Unfortunately, the inscriptions do not provide information upon the causes of war, or the form it took. In the 8th–9th centuries, intensive warfare resulted in the collapse of the kingdoms of the Petexbatún region of western Petén. The rapid abandonment of Aguateca by its inhabitants has provided a rare opportunity to examine the remains of Maya weaponry in situ. Aguateca was stormed by unknown enemies around 810 AD, who overcame its formidable defences and burned the royal palace. The elite inhabitants of the city either fled or were captured, and never returned to collect their abandoned property. The inhabitants of the periphery abandoned the site soon after. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of intensive warfare carried out by an enemy in order to completely eliminate a Maya state, rather than subjugate it. Research at Aguateca indicated that Classic period warriors were primarily members of the elite.|$|E

25|$|Also, {{the nests}} {{located near the}} {{periphery}} {{are more likely to}} be attacked than the ones in the center which are usually completely surrounded by other nests. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of the selfish herd theory and demonstrates how individuals may cluster together for protection against predators, but the ones in the middle tend to be safer than those on the outside. However, each colony is more prone to attack if the colony next to it is attacked. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of the attacked neighbor risk and reduces some of the benefit gained by participating in selfish herd tactics.|$|E
