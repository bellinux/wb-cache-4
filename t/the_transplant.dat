5|$|In {{patients}} developing liver failure, a {{liver transplant}} is often the only option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain <b>the</b> <b>transplant.</b> That being the case, the criteria have been reassessed, such as onset of symptoms, prothrombin time (PTT), serum bilirubin, and presence of encephalopathy, for determining at what point a transplant becomes necessary for survival. Evidence suggests, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning, {{up to half of}} those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. A follow-up study has shown most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36 hours of mushroom ingestion.|$|E

40|$|A {{role for}} neutral endopeptidase 24. 11 (NEP) in growth and {{development}} {{is supported by the}} demonstration that NEP hydrolyses and inactivates a number of peptide growth factors including atrial natriuretic peptide, endothelins, bombesin-like peptides, and opioid peptides, including the enkephalins. In the present study, suspensions of cells obtained from the ventral mesencephalon or cortex of rat embryos (ED 14) were implanted into the striatum of the adult rat brain. Three to 15 weeks after transplantation the relative distribution of NEP-positive cellular elements was visualized histochemically. NEP staining in <b>the</b> <b>transplants</b> consistently appeared before NEP staining in the surrounding host striatum supporting a relative increase in NEP activity in <b>the</b> <b>transplants.</b> <b>The</b> NEP staining richly visualized cells of varying size and morphology which lacked the normal organization of the host striatum. The histochemical staining in <b>the</b> <b>transplants</b> and <b>the</b> surrounding host tissue was completely blocked by a 100 nM concentration of the selective NEP inhibitors phosphoramidon or JHF- 26, supporting the exclusive localization of NEP by this method. NEP localization in the embryonic (ED 14) cortex and ventral mesencephalon was also confirmed, suggesting one possible origin for the NEP-positive cells visualized in <b>the</b> <b>transplants.</b> Fluorescent double-labeling studies for NEP and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or transforming growth factor alpha precursor (TGF alpha p) revealed the presence of rich glial labeling within <b>the</b> <b>transplants</b> for both GFAP and TGFap. NEP-labeled cells in <b>the</b> <b>transplants</b> were closely associated with glial elements, however, only occasional glial elements in <b>the</b> <b>transplants</b> stained for NEP; supporting a non-astrocytic localization for the NEP in <b>the</b> <b>transplants.</b> <b>The</b> marked enhancement of NEP staining in <b>the</b> <b>transplants</b> may have significance for controlling the rate or pattern of growth of <b>the</b> <b>transplanted</b> cells through inactivation of peptide growth factors produced by, or in response to, <b>the</b> <b>transplants...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{mean and}} {{standard}} deviation of MTR values were calculated for descriptive analysis and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was applied to test for normality. Using a repeated measurement analysis of variance, the mean values of all ROI of all off-resonance frequencies and flip angles of <b>the</b> <b>transplanted</b> and not transplanted lungs were compared to evaluate the following factors: localisation of ROI placement, off-resonance frequency; flip angle; and transplantation/no transplantation. After checking for normality using Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, Student’s t-test was performed for all flip angles and off-resonance frequencies for the following different groups: comparison A: <b>the</b> <b>transplanted</b> well-ventilated vs transplanted infiltrated lung tissue; comparison B: <b>the</b> <b>transplanted</b> lung with CAF (including well-ventilated and infiltrated lung tissue) vs <b>the</b> <b>transplanted</b> lung without CAF (including well-ventilated and infiltrated lung tissue); comparison C: <b>the</b> <b>transplanted</b> infiltrated lung tissue with CAF vs <b>the</b> <b>transplanted</b> infiltrated lung tissue without CAF.

5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote for amatoxin poisoning is available, {{but some}} specific treatments such as intravenous penicillin G {{have been shown}} to improve survival. There is some evidence that intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of amatoxins, preventing their uptake by hepatocytes, thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue.

40|$|Introduction. The Quilty Effect (lymphoid-cellular {{infiltration}} of the endocardium) {{is a frequent}} finding in biopsies of <b>the</b> <b>transplanted</b> heart. <b>The</b> role of this phenomenon in the rejection of <b>the</b> <b>transplanted</b> heart remains unclear. Aim. Retrospective analysis of endomyocardial biopsies of <b>the</b> <b>transplanted</b> heart and assessment {{of the relationship between}} acute cellular rejection and Quilty Effect. Methods and results. 112 endomyocardial biopsies with Quilty Effect were identified out of 883 studied biopsies during the period from January 2010 to June 2014. The frequency of Quilty damage occurrence in acute cellular rejection is significantly higher than in its absence (17. 7 % and 5. 6 %; р 0. 05). Conclusion. The Quilty Effect is a kind of manifestation of acute cellular rejection of <b>the</b> <b>transplanted</b> heart when immunosuppressive therapy with calcineurin inhibitors is used.   </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> fourth hand <b>transplant</b> {{recipient}} in Louisville {{lost his}} graft at nine months post transplant from ischemia due to severe graft arteriopathy.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe a method to allow non-invasive monitoring of wall thicknesses in the radial, ulnar, palmar arch, and digital arteries of <b>the</b> <b>transplanted</b> hand. A novel ultrasound biomicroscopy unit (Vevo 2100) was used to image the blood vessels of <b>the</b> <b>transplanted</b> and native hands in four hand transplant recipients, ranging from 16 months to 11 years post <b>transplant.</b> <b>The</b> unit has a potential resolution of 30 µm, which allowed measurement of the intima and media layers of the arteries.

In addition, <b>the</b> <b>transplanted</b> hand had significantly higher intima to lumen diameter ratios.

40|$|The {{activation}} time of endothelial cells and myogenic cells (presumptive satellite cells) in small skeletal muscle transplants was examined, {{as well as}} in the muscle bed underlying <b>the</b> <b>transplants,</b> using autoradiography and light microscopy. At varying intervals, from 12 to 336 hours (14 days) after transplantation, <b>the</b> <b>transplants</b> and some of the underlying muscle were removed from two or four mice (at each interval), after the injection of each animal with tritiated thymidine 1 hour prior to transplant removal. Thus premitotic cells synthesising DNA were labelled. Only one labelled endothelial cell nucleus was seen in all 20 <b>transplants</b> examined during <b>the</b> first 60 hours. Contrastingly, labelled endothelial nuclei were plentiful in muscles underlying <b>the</b> <b>transplants</b> from 36 hours post-transplantation. There was no evidence of a functional vascular supply in <b>the</b> <b>transplants</b> until 72 hours when one of <b>the</b> eight <b>transplants</b> examined at this time showed very slight peripheral revascularisation, with these peripheral vessels containing labelled endothelial cell nuclei. Ninety six hours after transplantation half <b>the</b> <b>transplants</b> sampled showed peripheral revascularisation, with these vessels containing labelled nuclei, and by 120 hours all transplants showed functional blood vessels and contained labelled endothelial cell nuclei. By 14 days after transplantation revascularisation and myogenesis were complete with only an occasional labelled nucleus seen. Autoradiographically labelled premitotic muscle nuclei (presumptive satellite cells) were observed in transplants from 48 hours after transplantation. These results show that revascularisation of <b>the</b> <b>transplanted</b> muscles is not necessary for the activation of myogenic cells, but that activation is probably due to some other stimulus, possibly the diffusion of nutrients from blood vessels of the adjacent tissues...|$|R
