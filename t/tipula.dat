40|$|International audienceThe {{nematode}} Oscheius <b>tipulae</b> {{belongs to}} the same family (Rhabditidae) as the model species Caenorhabditis elegans. Both species reproduce through self-fertilizing hermaphrodites and facultative males. Recent {{studies have shown that}} the self-fertile C. elegans and C. briggsae displayed a 20 -fold lower genetic diversity than the male-female species C. remanei. Several explanations have been put forward to account for this difference, including their mode of reproduction and dynamic population structure. Here, we present the results of extensive worldwide sampling of O. <b>tipulae,</b> which we previously used as a laboratory organism for developmental genetics. We found that O. <b>tipulae</b> is much more widespread and common in soil throughout the world than Caenorhabditis species. We analysed 63 O. <b>tipulae</b> isolates from several continents using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). We found that O. <b>tipulae</b> harbours a 5 -fold higher genetic diversity than C. elegans and C. briggsae. As in C. elegans, a high proportion of this diversity was found locally. Yet, we detected significant geographical differentiation, both at the worldwide scale with a latitudinal structure and between three localities in France. In summary, O. <b>tipulae</b> exhibited significantly higher levels of genetic diversity and large-scale geographical structure than C. elegans, despite their shared mode of reproduction. This species difference in genetic diversity may be explained by a number of other differences, such as population size, distribution, migration and dynamics. Due to its widespread occurrence and relatively high genetic diversity, O. <b>tipulae</b> may be a promising study species for evolutionary studies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the purification of yolk proteins, which {{are important for}} the reproduction of egg-laying animals, and the structural characterization of two vitellogenins, VT 1 and OTI-VIT- 6, of the nematode Oscheius <b>tipulae.</b> O. <b>tipulae</b> is an alternative model organism to its relative, the widely used Caenorhabditis elegans, and is a good model to understand reproduction in insect parasitic nematodes of the genus Heterorhabditis. The native purified O. <b>tipulae</b> vitellogenin is composed of three polypeptides (VT 1, VT 2 and VT 3), whereas in C. elegans, vitellogenin is composed of four polypeptides. The gene (Oti-vit- 1) encoding yolk polypeptide VT 1 has been recently identified in the genome of O. <b>tipulae.</b> Immunoblotting and N-terminal sequencing confirmed that VT 1 is indeed coded by Oti-vit- 1. Utilizing the same experimental approaches, we showed that the polypeptides VT 2 and VT 3 are derived from the proteolytic processing of the C- and N-terminal portions of the precursor OTI-VIT- 6, respectively. We also showed that the recombinant polypeptide (P 40), corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of OTI-VIT- 6, preferentially interacts with a 100 -kDa polypeptide found in adult worm extracts, as we have previously shown for the native vitellins of O. <b>tipulae.</b> Using the putative nematode vitellogenin amino acid sequences available in the UniProtKB database, we constructed a phylogenetic tree and showed that the O. <b>tipulae</b> vitellogenins characterized {{in this study are}} orthologous to those of the Caenorhabditis spp. Together, these results represent the first structural and functional comparative study of nematode yolk proteins outside the Caenorhabditis genu...|$|R

Of beetles the honey-feeding ones prevailed, with European forms of others that inhabit yak-droppings.* [As Aphodius and Geotrupes. Predaceous genera were very rare, as Carabus and Staphylinus, so typical of boreal regions.

The genus Elaphomyia, discovered by Mr. Wallace[444] in New Guinea, is highly remarkable, as the males are furnished with horns, of which the females are quite destitute. The horns spring from beneath the eyes, and curiously resemble those of stags, being either branched or palmated. They equal in length {{the whole of the}} body in one of the species. They might be thought to serve for fighting, but as in one species they are of a beautiful pink colour, edged with black, with a pale central stripe, and as these insects have altogether a very elegant appearance, it is perhaps more probable that the horns serve as ornaments. That the males of some Diptera fight together is certain; for Prof. Westwood[445] has several times seen this with some species of <b>Tipula</b> or Harry-long-legs. Many observers believe that when gnats (Culicidæ) dance in the air in a body, alternately rising and falling, the males are courting the females.

40|$|AbstractThe cell {{interactions}} that specify the spatial pattern of vulval precursor cell (VPC) fates differ between the nematodes Oscheius <b>tipulae</b> CEW 1 and Caenorhabditis elegans. In the former, the centered pattern of fates is obtained by two successive inductions from the gonadal anchor cell, {{whereas in the}} latter, a single inductive step by the anchor cell (EGF–Ras–MAP kinase pathway) {{can act as a}} morphogen and is reinforced by lateral signaling between the vulval precursors (Notch pathway). We performed a genetic screen for vulva mutants in O. <b>tipulae</b> CEW 1. Here we present the mutants that specifically affect the vulval induction mechanisms. Phenotypic and epistatic analyses of these mutants show that both vulval induction steps share common components, one of which appears to be MEK kinase(s). Moreover, the inductive pathway (including MEK kinase) influences the competence of the vulval precursor cells and more strikingly their division pattern as well, irrespective of their vulval fate. Finally, a comparison of vulval mutant phenotypes obtained in C. elegans and O. <b>tipulae</b> CEW 1 highlights the evolution of vulval induction mechanisms between the two species...|$|R
60|$|If, {{however, the}} lobes {{are made to}} close over a bit of meat or an insect, the result is different, for the glands over the whole surface of the leaf now secrete copiously. [page 296] As {{in this case the}} glands on both sides are pressed against the meat or insect, the {{secretion}} from the first is twice as great as when a bit of meat is laid on the surface of one lobe; and as the two lobes come into almost close contact, the secretion, containing dissolved animal matter, spreads by capillary attraction, causing fresh glands on both sides to begin secreting in a continually widening circle. The secretion is almost colourless, slightly mucilaginous, and, judging by {{the manner in which it}} coloured litmus paper, more strongly acid than that of Drosera. It is so copious that on one occasion, when a leaf was cut open, on which a small cube of albumen had been placed 45 hrs. before, drops rolled off the leaf. On another occasion, in which a leaf with an enclosed bit of roast meat spontaneously opened after eight days, there was so much secretion in the furrow over the midrib that it trickled down. A large crushed fly (<b>Tipula)</b> was placed on a leaf from which a small portion at the base of one lobe had previously been cut away, so that an opening was left; and through this, the secretion continued to run down the footstalk during nine days,--that is, for as long a time as it was observed. By forcing up one of the lobes, I was able to see some distance between them, and all the glands within sight were secreting freely.|$|E
60|$|There {{is another}} wide {{difference}} in the action of leaves which enclose objects, such as bits of wood, cork, balls of paper, or which have had their filaments merely touched, and those which enclose organic bodies yielding soluble nitrogenous matter. In the former case the leaves, as we have seen, open in under 24 hrs. and are then ready, even before being fully-expanded, to shut again. But if they have closed over nitrogen-yielding bodies, they remain closely shut for many days; and after re-expanding are torpid, and never act again, or only after a considerable interval of time. In four instances, leaves after catching insects never reopened, but began to wither, remaining closed--in one case for fifteen days over a fly; in a second, for twenty-four days, though the fly was small; in a third for twenty-four days over a woodlouse; and in a fourth, for thirty-five days over a large <b>Tipula.</b> In two other cases leaves remained closed for at least nine days over flies, and for how many more I do not know. It should, however, be added that in two instances in which very small insects had been naturally caught the leaf opened as quickly {{as if nothing had}} been caught; and I suppose that this was due to such small insects not having been crushed or not having excreted any animal matter, so that the glands were not excited. Small angular bits of albumen and gelatine were placed at both ends of three leaves, two of which remained closed for thirteen and the other for twelve days. Two other leaves remained closed over bits of [page 310] meat for eleven days, a third leaf for eight days, and a fourth (but this had been cracked and injured) for only six days. Bits of cheese, or casein, were placed at one end and albumen {{at the other end of}} three leaves; and the ends with the former opened after six, eight, and nine days, whilst the opposite ends opened a little later. None of the above bits of meat, albumen, &c., exceeded a cube of 1/10 of an inch (2.54 mm.) in size, and were sometimes smaller; yet these small portions sufficed to keep the leaves closed for many days. Dr. Canby informs me that leaves remain shut for a longer time over insects than over meat; and from what I have seen, I can well believe that this is the case, especially if the insects are large.|$|E

This polypeptide is a specific worm`s vitellin-binding protein that is present only in adult worms. Blots containing purified O. <b>tipulae</b> vitellin preparations showed no detectable signal in the 100 kDa region, ruling out any possibility of yolk polypeptides self-assembling under the conditions used in our assay. Experiments done {{in the presence of}} alpha-methyl mannoside ruled out the possibility of vitellins binding to P 100 through mannose residues.

Most of the introns in the eEF 1 A genes are specific to O. <b>tipulae</b> and are not shared with any of the other genes described in metazoans. Most of the introns are phase 0 (inserted between two codons), and few are inserted in protosplice sites (introns inserted between the nucleotide sequence A/CAG and G/A). Two of these phase 0 introns are conserved in sequence in two or more of the four eEF 1 A gene copies, and are inserted in the same position in the genes. Neither of these characteristics has been detected in any of the nematode eEF 1 A genes characterized to date. The coding sequences were also compared with other eEF 1 A cDNAs from 11 different nematodes to determine the variability of these genes within the phylum Nematoda. Parsimony and distance trees yielded similar topologies, which were similar to those created using other molecular markers. The presence of more than one copy of the eEF 1 A gene with nearly identical coding regions makes it difficult to define the orthologous cDNAs.

40|$|Microsporidia are fungi-related {{intracellular}} pathogens {{that may}} infect virtually all animals, but are poorly understood. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has recently {{become a model}} host for studying microsporidia through the identification of its natural microsporidian pathogen Nematocida parisii. However, it was unclear how widespread and diverse microsporidia infections are in C. elegans or other related nematodes in the wild. Here we describe the isolation and culture of 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections. N. parisii {{is found to be}} the most common microsporidia infecting C. elegans in the wild. In addition, we further describe and name six new species in the Nematocida genus. Our sampling and phylogenetic analysis further identify two subclades that are genetically distinct from Nematocida, and we name them Enteropsectra and Pancytospora. Interestingly, unlike Nematocida, these two genera belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. All of these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells, except Pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host. At the subcellular level in the infected host cell, spores of the novel genus Enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane, instead of exiting via exocytosis as spores of Nematocida. Host specificity is broad for some microsporidia, narrow for others: indeed, some microsporidia can infect Oscheius <b>tipulae</b> but not its sister species Oscheius sp. 3, and conversely some microsporidia found infecting Oscheius sp. 3 do not infect O. <b>tipulae.</b> We also show that N. ausubeli fails to strongly induce in C. elegans the transcription of genes that are induced by other Nematocida species, suggesting it has evolved mechanisms to prevent induction of this host response. Altogether, these newly isolated species illustrate the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes, and provide a rich resource to investigate host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts...|$|R

40|$|Background: Gene {{silencing}} by RNA interference (RNAi) is {{a powerful}} tool for functional genomics. Although RNAi was first described in Caenorhabditis elegans, several nematode species are unable to mount an RNAi response when exposed to exogenous double stranded RNA (dsRNA). These include the satellite model organisms Pristionchus pacificus and Oscheius <b>tipulae.</b> Available data also suggest that the RNAi path way targeting exogenous dsRNA may not be fully functional in some animal parasitic nematodes. The genus Panagrolaimus contains bacterial feeding nematodes which occupy a diversity of niches ranging from polar, temperate and semi-arid soils to terrestrial mosses. Thus many Panagrolaimus species are adapted to tolerate freezing and desiccation and are excellent systems to study the molecular basis of environmental stress tolerance. We inve stigated whether Panagrolaimus is susceptible to RNAi to determine whether this nematode could be used in large scale RNAi studies in functional genomics. Results: We studied two species: Panagrolaimus sp. PS 1159 and Panagrolaimus superbus. Both nematode species displayed embryonic lethal RNAi phenotypes following ingestion of Escherichia coli expressing dsRNA for the C. elegans embryonic lethal genes Ce-lmn- 1 and Ce-ran- 4.

40|$|AbstractVulval {{epithelial}} tubes invaginate through concerted cell migration, ring formation, stacking of {{rings and}} intra-ring cell fusion in the nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans, Oscheius <b>tipulae</b> and Pristionchus pacificus. The number of rings forming the invaginations is invariantly seven, six, and eight, respectively. We hypothesize that each ring is formed from pairs of symmetrically positioned primordial vulval cells following three premises: If the final cell division is left–right, the daughters will fuse, migrate and form only one ring. If these cells do not divide, one ring will form. If the final division is anterior–posterior, two rings will form. We test the ring hypothesis and found coincidence between {{the patterns of}} vulva cell divisions {{and the number of}} rings for 12 species. We find heterochronic variations in the timing of division, migration and fusion of the vulval cells between species. We report a unique ring-independent pathway of vulva formation in Panagrellus redivivus. C. elegans lin- 11 (n 389) mutation results in cell fate transformations including changes in the orientation of vulval cell division. lin- 11 animals have an additional ring, as predicted by the ring hypothesis.
