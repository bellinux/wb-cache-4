500|$|The idea of reuniting with Nolan and Cooper {{was first}} {{proposed}} in January 2010, when Mark O'Connell suggested Lazzara talk with Nolan on the phone. Lazzara said: [...] "One day he [...] {{called me and}} was like, 'Hey, man, {{what do you think}} about us going back to our original lineup?' And I was like, 'Are you crazy?

[...] O'Connell continued to insist on the idea, [...] "and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> call from John ... it felt like no time had passed ... like we had just talked a few days ago".

5000|$|As a teenager, Joseph Mount began Metronomy as {{a bedroom}} project {{while he was}} still living with his parents in Devon.

The name Metronomy was originally chosen by Mount as the name sounded cool and interesting and was in keeping with the bands he was heavily into, namely Autechre and Funkstorung. The word 'Metronomy' is also linked to a metronome, which is a piece of equipment musicians use to help keep and set tempo.|$|R
60|$|And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> {{sample of}} Mulligan Jacobs. The venom of hatred I {{had already seen}} in his face was as nothing {{compared}} with what now was manifested.

6000|$|<b>Then</b> one day <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> {{letter from}} [...] "Kipper" [...] {{to say he}} was over for a holiday and was {{stopping}} at Morley's, and asking me to look him up.|$|R

6000|$|So <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> shovel, {{and then}} we picked and shoveled, turn about, and made the fur fly.

6000|$|All nodded. [...] "Well, <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> proposition, boys. You {{can take}} it or leave it, but just listen kindly to it.

60|$|He consented, and I {{brought him}} to the Bath, which was about fifteen miles, as I remember.

I sat up with him so much and so often, that at last, indeed, he would not let me sit up any longer, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> pallet-bed into his room, and lay in it just at his bed's feet.|$|E

500|$|I've {{been in a}} {{reflective}} state of mind. I've done lot of soul searching and I just felt in a romantic mood when I was writing for [...] so that's what I wrote about... I decided that I {{wanted to work with}} a whole bunch of different producers. [...] Björk's album was one of my favorite for years—it's brilliantly produced. And I also wanted to work with Massive Attack. So obviously, he was on the list.

5000|$|Bradfield also {{tackled the}} subject of the many guest that have {{appeared}} on the last two Manic Street Preachers records, Rewind the Film and Futurology: [...] "I'm 12 albums in - I know my voice can only do certain things, and if I can't take other people singing on the track <b>then</b> <b>I</b> really have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> Napoleon complex.

60|$|I did not {{quit the}} saddle until the planks of the wharf {{were under the}} horse's hoofs. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> view of the sloop's decks, for the first time. A respectable-looking, tall, slender, middle-aged man, with a bright dark eye, was on the quarter-deck, and I bowed to him, {{inferring}} at once {{that he was one}} of the medical gentlemen to whom I had sent the message. In effect, it was Post, the second named on my list, the first not being able to come. He returned my bow, but, before I could alight and go on board to receive him, Marble's head rose from the cabin, and my mate sprang ashore, and shook me cordially by the hand.|$|E
60|$|The {{first thing}} we did was to clew up the three top-gallant-sails. This gave us a much easier command of the vessel, short-handed as we were, and it {{rendered}} it less hazardous to the spars to keep the Dawn on a wind. When this was done, I ordered the after-braces manned, and the leaches brought as near as possible to touching. It was time; for the oars were heard, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> view of the boat as it came glancing down on our weather quarter. I instantly gave the order to fill the after sails, {{and to keep the}} ship full and by. The braces were manned, as well as they could be, by Marble, Neb and the cook, while I kept an eye on the boat, with an occasional glance at the man at the wheel.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at {{the bronze}} panels. I thought I heard {{something}} stir inside--to be explicit, I thought I {{heard a sound}} like a chuckle--but I must have been mistaken. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> big pebble from the river, and came and hammered till I had flattened a coil in the decorations, and the verdigris came off in powdery flakes. The delicate little people must have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand, but nothing came of it. I saw a crowd of them upon the slopes, looking furtively at me. At last, hot and tired, I sat down to watch the place. But I was too restless to watch long; I am too Occidental for a long vigil. I could work at a problem for years, but to wait inactive for twenty-four hours--that is another matter.|$|E
5000|$|In a 1992 interview, Lien said: [...] "My {{childhood}} was wild because I was very uncomfortable living where I lived (the South Side of Chicago). It was very industrial - if you didn’t fit in {{you got your}} ass kicked. I was just my own person, and I adopted this really tough skin because I had to if I wanted to survive. A {{lot of my friends}} were into drugs, and I saw a lot of them die." [...] In a 1993 interview, Lien said: When I was a little kid in Chicago, I always used to pretend I was somebody else. I wrote little plays, I was a tomboy, I hung out with the guys a lot. I never had much interest in hanging out with girls. I was always writing plays or watching movies or reading books, and when I was in seventh grade in junior high, I joined the drama club and found that I could fit right in, I could relax, I could do anything I wanted. I began to think I could make a difference, I could make people happy. I felt like I made the world just a little better for a while. Then, on the advice of an eighth grade teacher, I went to acting class, and <b>then</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> agent. <b>I</b> did industrial films and some theatre. Soon, casting directors started hiring me and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> interview with the people from AW. They liked me, asked me to come to New York, so here I am! ...|$|R
5000|$|Their {{first album}} was {{released}} in 1983 and was titled Crucificados pelo sistema. Released on the Ataque Frontal label, {{it was one of}} the fastest selling hardcore albums to come out of the country, and was soon considered a punk classic worldwide. The line up was João Gordo (vocals), Mingau (guitar - later in many punk and pop bands in Brazil), Jabá (bass) and Jão (drums). Soon after, with the fall of the São Paulo punk scene (because of associated gang violence), the band split up and since then João Gordo has been accused of selling out and betraying the DIY ethics of the punk movement for several alleged reasons; he has said, [...] "I'm a traitor since 1983, because I told the guys I played hardcore, not punk. <b>Then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> labelled.(...)That's <b>a</b> stigma".|$|R
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1932, Kipke ordered his {{veterans}} to pound Ward [...] "without mercy" [...] during practice.

6000|$|Sherrard Clemens was a Republican Congressman from West Virginia {{in the war}} days, {{and then}} went out to St. Louis, where the James Clemens branch lived, and still lives, and there he became a warm rebel.

The Clemenses have always done the best they could to keep the {{political}} balances level, no matter how much it might inconvenience them. I did not know what had become of Sherrard Clemens; but once I introduced Senator Hawley to a Republican mass meeting in New England, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> bitter letter from Sherrard from St. Louis. He said that the Republicans of the North--no, the [...] "mudsills of the North"--had swept away the old aristocracy of the South with fire and sword, and it ill became me, an aristocrat by blood, to train with that kind of swine.

60|$|We {{sat for a}} while, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> {{match and}} lit the lamp that stood ready on the table, for the half-light began to grow dreary, as it is apt to do when one has a short week ago buried the hope of one's life. Next, I opened a {{cupboard}} in the wainscoting and got a bottle of whisky and some tumblers and water. I always like {{to do these things}} for myself: it is irritating to me to have somebody continually at my elbow, as though I were an eighteen-month-old baby. All this while Curtis and Good had been silent, feeling, I suppose, that they had nothing to say that could do me any good, and content to give me the comfort of their presence and unspoken sympathy; for it was only their second visit since the funeral. And it is, by the way, from the presence of others that we really derive support in our dark hours of grief, and not from their talk, which often only serves to irritate us. Before a bad storm the game always herd together, but they cease their calling.|$|E
60|$|It {{is strange}} how {{attached}} we become to old friends, though they be but inanimate objects. The old pipe put aside, I {{turned to a}} meerschaum, which had been presented to me years before, with the caution that I must not smoke it unless I wore kid gloves. There was no savor in that pipe for me. I tried another brier, {{and it made me}} unhappy. Clays would not keep in with me. It seemed as if they knew I was hankering after the old pipe, and went out in disgust. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> new amber mouth-piece for my first love. In a week I had bitten that through too, and in an over-anxious attempt to file off the ragged edges I broke the screw. Moralists have said that the smoker who has no thought but for his pipe never breaks it; that it is he only who while smoking concentrates his mind on some less worthy object that sends his teeth through the amber. This may be so; for I am a philosopher, and when working out new theories I may have been careless even of that which inspired them most.|$|E
6000|$|Adele was {{not easy}} to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept running to the door and looking over the {{banisters}} to see if she could get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library, where I knew she was not wanted; <b>then,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> little angry, and made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her [...] "ami, Monsieur Edouard Fairfax de Rochester," [...] as she dubbed him (I had not before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little box in whose contents she had an interest.|$|R
