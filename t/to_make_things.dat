5|$|Due to an archaic law in Erie County, {{the town}} of Tonawanda and {{the town of}} Amherst, who {{completed}} the road in 1925, were requested in 1935 to take over $2million (1935USD) in debts bonded for its construction. The county noted that the towns' inability to pay for the road made the new road a financial burden for the county. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>things</b> worse, the new road did not bring the immediate influx of business that was advertised and was looking early on as a giant mistake {{on the part of the}} county and towns.|$|E
5|$|Perry {{was made}} a platypus because of the animal's {{striking}} appearance {{and the lack of}} public knowledge of the animal, which allowed the writers <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>things</b> up about the species. Critical reception for the character from both professionals and fans have been considerably positive. Merchandising of the character include plush toys, t-shirts, wooden toys, glasses, and coloring books, along with appearances in literature and a 2009 video game for the Nintendo DS.|$|E

5|$|On 2 March 1737, penniless, Johnson {{left for}} London {{with his former}} pupil David Garrick. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>things</b> worse, Johnson {{received}} word that his brother had died on the day they left. However, their prospects were not completely hopeless, as Garrick was set to inherit a large sum the next year. Also, Garrick had connections in London, and the two would stay with his distant relative, Richard Norris, who lived on Exeter Street. Johnson did not stay there long, and set out for Greenwich near the Golden Hart Tavern to finish Irene. During that time, he wrote to Cave on 12 July 1737 and proposed a translation for Paolo Sarpi's The History of the Council of Trent (1619), which Cave did not accept until months later.|$|E
5|$|The {{first to}} realise the mistake was General Dembiński, the {{commanding}} officer of the Reserve Corps tasked with defending the western sector. He immediately asked for reinforcements, but was denied by General Krukowiecki. Forced to fight alone, Dembiński did not reinforce the first line with his reserve 3rd Infantry Division and instead sent forward only a token force: half a battalion to man Fort 58 and support Fort 57. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>things</b> worse for the Poles, General Umiński, {{the commanding officer}} of the southern sector, focused entirely on the skirmishes around Królikarnia and did not notice {{what was happening in}} Wola. Around 7:00 he reinforced Królikarnia with almost six battalions of infantry (ca. 2,800 men) and three guns. Forts 54 and 55 received no reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} claims since WrestleMania III that the quoted attendance figure of 93,173 which established a world record attendance for an indoor event was false and that the real attendance figure was only around 78,000. This is based on claims by Dave Meltzer upon receiving information from the events promoter Zane Bresloff, and that wrestling promoters (including Vince McMahon) were known to regularly inflate attendance figures <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>things</b> look better. While the WWE and Silverdome management have always maintained that the 93,173 figure is correct, debate continues among wrestling fans {{as to what the}} true attendance was on the day. Also, Meltzer claimed that the 1992 SummerSlam at Wembley did 79,127, more than WrestleMania III. The record would be decisively broken by WrestleMania 32 in 2016.|$|E

5|$|The Heart of Ezra Greer is a 1917 American silent drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company and directed by Emile Chautard. The film focuses on Ezra Greer, a successful middle-aged man who searches for his college age daughter, Mary. The wayward Mary was romanced and abandoned by Jack Denbeigh, later bearing his child. Once Ezra becomes broke he finds employment as the valet for Jack Denbeigh. After Jack's engagement to a cabaret girl, Mary becomes upset and leaves her child at Jack's home.

Ezra convinces Jack <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>things</b> right and Ezra convinces the cabaret girl to leave Jack.

The film was released by Pathé on October 7, 1917. The film was the final release from Thanhouser and was deemed to be an average film by most reviewers. Criticism for the film hinged on far-fetched coincidences to drive the plot. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
