5|$|In {{addition}} to the evidentiary guidelines forensic anthropologists should always {{keep in mind that}} the remains they are working with were once a person. If possible, local customs regarding dealing with the dead should be observed and all remains should be <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> and dignity.|$|E
5|$|Andalusian {{horses are}} elegant and {{strongly}} built. Members of the breed have heads of medium length, {{with a straight}} or slightly convex profile. Ultra convex and concave profiles are discouraged in the breed, and are penalized in breed shows. Necks are long and broad, running to well-defined withers and a massive chest. They have a short back and broad, strong hindquarters with a well-rounded croup. The breed tends to have clean legs, with no propensity for blemishes or injuries, and energetic gaits. The mane and tail are thick and long, but the legs do not have excess feathering. Andalusians tend to be docile, while remaining intelligent and sensitive. When <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> they are quick to learn, responsive, and cooperative.|$|E
5|$|Mrs. Puff's {{friendliness}} {{toward other}} characters varies. She sympathizes with the short-tempered Squidward Tentacles, and considers {{him to be}} the prime example of an outstandingly good driver. Patrick, who has attended Mrs. Puff's class multiple times, is <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> by her in spite of his slow-wittedness (Patrick is an expert driver and has passed every time he appears, usually re-appearing in the school after losing his license in some way). Of all the residents of Bikini Bottom, she is closest to SpongeBob. While she normally dreads having to drive with SpongeBob, she often acts as a motherly figure towards him.|$|E

5|$|The {{only major}} battle {{that took place}} between Japan and Germany was the siege of the German-controlled Chinese port of Tsingtao in Kiautschou Bay. The German forces held out from August until November 1914, under a total Japanese/British blockade, {{sustained}} artillery barrages and manpower odds of 6:1 – a fact that gave a morale boost during the siege as well as later in defeat. After Japanese troops stormed the city, the German dead were buried at Tsingtao and the remaining troops were transported to Japan where they were <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> at places like the Bandō Prisoner of War camp. In 1919, when the German Empire formally signed the Treaty of Versailles, all prisoners of war were set free and returned to Europe.|$|E
5|$|When South Africa {{became a}} {{republic}} in 1961, the flag remained the same. The Afrikaner voting majority disliked the flag retaining the Union Jack in the centre. Repeated calls {{were made for}} it to be removed or for a new flag but no action was taken by the ruling National Party until 1968. B.J. Vorster convened a commission in that year to create a new flag in time for the 10th anniversary of South Africa's declaration of independence in 1971, but no changes were eventually made. The flag was <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> by Afrikaners with daily flag salutes in schools. It was also used as part of celebrations of the inauguration of the State President.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of his stronghold in Kediri, Trunajaya managed to escape to the {{mountains}} of eastern Java. VOC and the king's forces chased Trunajaya, who, isolated and deprived of food, surrendered to the VOC {{at the end of}} 1679. Initially, he was <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> as a captive of the VOC commander. However, during a ceremonial visit to the royal residence in Payak, East Java, on 2 January 1680, he was personally stabbed by Amangkurat, and the king's courtiers finished him off. The king defended this killing of a VOC prisoner by saying that Trunajaya had tried to kill him. The VOC was not convinced by this explanation, but it chose not to call the king into account. A romanticised account of Trunajaya's death appears in the 18th-century Central Javanese babads.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{travelled}} from Baghdad to Constantinople between 3 May and 17 August 1863, {{accompanied by}} a large group including family members and followers. During the trip, he was <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> in the towns he visited, and when he reached Constantinople, he {{was treated as a}} government guest. Why the Ottoman authorities did not permit his extradition to Persia, but instead invited him to come to Constantinople, is unclear. The reason may have been political because Bahá'u'lláh was viewed as a person of influence. After three and a half months in Constantinople, he was ordered to depart for Adrianople. The reason for this further move is also unclear. It may have been due to pressure from the Persian ambassador, combined with Bahá'u'lláh's refusal to work with the Ottoman authorities.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1344, Baligh, whose {{supporters}} and kinsmen served as Ahmad's well-spring of support, defected to the sultan's army. The local defectors informed besieging Mamluks of a vulnerability in al-Karak's defenses. With this intelligence, on 4 July, the Mamluks, {{under the command of}} Emir Sanjar al-Jawli, entered the fortress and captured an-Nasir Ahmad, who had been wounded and was <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> by his captors. Still suspicious of his Egyptian captors, he refused to eat meals provided by them, only agreeing to eat food handled by his al-Karak partisans. He was sent to Cairo, where as-Salih Isma'il secretly ordered to have him decapitated by a mercenary on 16 July. An-Nasir Ahmad's head was brought to the Cairo Citadel where it was displayed. His body was buried {{at the foot of the}} fortress of al-Karak.|$|E
5|$|Thedas is a {{world in}} which race and class combine to {{determine}} social class. Elves are often viewed as second-class citizens by humans, while human nobles are <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect.</b> Mages, on the other hand, are cloistered by the Chantry: they have access to the Fade, the unconscious realm that is the home of spirits, and a single lapse in vigilance could cause them to be possessed by demons. Apostate mages, who live outside the Chantry's control, are considered extremely dangerous, and the Chantry has a militant wing, the Templars, to seek them out and subdue them by any means necessary. Dwarves live in the Deep Roads, their kingdom a shadow of what it once was before the first Blight. Their society is rooted in tradition and a rigid caste system.|$|E

Mulligan was exchanged on October 30, 1861.|$|E

25|$|Free will here is predominately <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> to {{physical}} determinism {{in the strict sense}} of nomological determinism, although {{other forms of}} determinism are also relevant to free will. For example, logical and theological determinism challenge metaphysical libertarianism with ideas of destiny and fate, and biological, cultural and psychological determinism feed the development of compatibilist models. Separate classes of compatibilism and incompatibilism may even be formed to represent these.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} of Mongols was initially a fairly superficial affair. The process of establishment of Islam {{did not happen}} suddenly. Öljeitü's historian Qāshāni records that Qutlugh-Shah after losing patience with a dispute between Hanafis and Shafi'is, expressed his view that Islam should be abandoned and Mongols should return to the ways of Genghis Khan. Qāshani also stated that Oljeitu had in fact reverted for a brief period. As Muslims, Mongols showed a marked preference for Sufism with masters like Safi-ad-din Ardabili often <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> and favour.|$|E
