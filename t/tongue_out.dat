5|$|The opening segment, {{reminiscent}} of a traditional British 1950s working class street of terraced houses, was filmed at Carnew Street in Dublin, and features scenes of {{each member of the}} group knocking on different doors. Then during the first chorus, the group performs a hand-action dance, that was also used during their live performances. The second half of the video, set {{in the small town of}} Rathdrum, County Wicklow. showed the group interacting with young girls in various activities, such as running around the streets dancing, skipping rope, playing hopscotch, cat's cradle and pat-a-cake, hula hooping, Geri horseback riding, and participating in competitions of various kinds. The locals are depicted as working-class people who attend the local fair or have a drink in the pub. At the end of the video, the group performs at a stage in the local hall in front of an audience of young and old people. The audience applauds after the song is finished. Geri can be seen sticking her <b>tongue</b> <b>out</b> and the video ends.|$|E
25|$|Sticking one's <b>tongue</b> <b>out</b> {{at someone}} is {{considered}} a childish gesture of rudeness and/or defiance in many countries; the act may also have sexual connotations, depending {{on the way in}} which it is done. However, in Tibet it {{is considered a}} greeting. In 2009, a farmer from Fabriano, Italy was convicted and fined by the country's highest court for sticking his <b>tongue</b> <b>out</b> at a neighbor with whom he had been arguing. Proof of the affront had been captured with a cell phone camera. Blowing a raspberry can also be meant as a gesture of derision.|$|E
25|$|A {{variation}} {{is to put}} the V sign with the fingers {{on either side of the}} mouth (usually with the knuckles facing the observer) and to stick the <b>tongue</b> <b>out.</b> Most of the time the tongue is wriggled around. This is used to signify cunnilingus and the gesture is often off-colour.|$|E

25|$|This monitor has {{the ability}} to {{increase}} the size of its mouth by spreading the hyoid apparatus and dropping the lower jaw to eat large prey, a process similar in appearance to that of snakes, although the jaw of the mangrove monitor remains rigid. The mangrove monitor possesses a Jacobson's organ, which it uses to detect prey, sticking its <b>tongue</b> <b>out</b> to gather scents and touching it to the opening of the organ when the tongue is retracted.|$|E

Loeser pulled Dillinger's <b>tongue</b> <b>out</b> of his mouth {{with a pair of}} forceps, {{and at the same time}} forcing both elbows into his ribs. Dillinger gasped and resumed breathing. The procedure continued with only a local anaesthetic. Loeser removed several moles on Dillinger's forehead, made an incision in his nose and an incision in his chin and tied back both cheeks.|$|E
25|$|Australian born Tony Smith {{took charge}} of England in 2008 and his first game was against France in Toulouse where his Lions won 56–8. In his second game England were missing St Helens and Leeds Rhinos players but the team still created history with a record 74–0 win over Wales in Doncaster. It was England's biggest win they {{recorded}} over Wales since 1978. Smith {{has been living in}} England since he first arrived to play for Workington in 1996 and he controversially became a neutralised British citizen on 8 September 2008 in Huddersfield. It was World Cup year and he announced his ambitions that he wanted England to win their first World Cup since 1972 when Great Britain represented the country at the event. In the event they were placed in Group A alongside hosts Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. England faced a scare in their opening game against Papua New Guinea as the Lions were trailing 16–12 at halftime but they did go on to win the game. They were humiliated in their second game against the hosts suffering their biggest defeat to date, beating their 43-point margin against New Zealand eight years ago. In their final pool game against New Zealand they produced a much better performance but for only 28 minutes as they gave up a 24–8 lead to lose 24–36. Before and during the match England were accusing New Zealand of being soft, however after the match media outlets were calling England the biggest losers of the tournament. Controversy also occurred before the game kicked off, when England refused to face New Zealand's haka challenge. Smith said 'In some cultures poking your <b>tongue</b> <b>out</b> at others could be seen as insulting and the Kiwis pushed things too far by crossing into England’s side of halfway.' They took on New Zealand again in the semi-final. This time they never had the lead over the Kiwis as they lost the match by 10 points. After rumours Smith would be sacked from his position, the RFL announced they'd keep faith in Smith for the remainder of his contract. The World Cup players took the blame for their performances.|$|E

He had an eye on his stomach, round and yellow, emitting a glare like a fire-name. Looking wicked he thrust his big <b>tongue</b> <b>out</b> of his huge mouth licking the sides." [...] The Ramayana presents a similar description of Kabandha. Kabandha had a broad chest and was without a head or neck. He had only one eye {{on his chest and}} a mouth on his belly. He used his long arms to draw his prey closer. Kabandha is often depicted as a tree.|$|E

500|$|Kelly drank a lot; saxophonist Jimmy Heath {{described}} him as [...] "an alcoholic" [...] who [...] "could control his drinking" [...] and not let his playing be affected by it. Kelly was known [...] "for being a very warm, generous human being". Bassist Bill Crow reported that Kelly was [...] "full of fun": [...] "He was often the center of backstage laughing sessions as we told stories on each other. Wynton had a removable upper front denture. While on stage, if he saw some of us standing in the wings listening, he would turn around so the audience couldn't see, give us a stern look, and drop his upper plate forward onto his lower lip, creating a grotesquely comical effect. Sometimes he heightened it by sticking his <b>tongue</b> <b>out</b> at us over his upper teeth." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve is tested {{by examining the}} tongue and its movements. At rest, if the nerve is injured a tongue may appear to have {{the appearance of a}} [...] "bag of worms" [...] (fasciculations) or wasting (atrophy). The nerve is then tested by sticking the <b>tongue</b> <b>out.</b> If there is damage to the nerve or its pathways, the tongue will usually but not always deviate to one side. [...] When the nerve is damaged, the tongue may feel [...] "thick", [...] "heavy", or [...] "clumsy." [...] Weakness of tongue muscles can result in slurred speech, affecting sounds particularly dependent on the tongue for generation (i.e., lateral approximants, dental stops, alveolar stops, velar nasals, rhotic consonants etc.). Tongue strength may be tested by poking the tongue against the inside of their cheek, while an examiner feels or presses from the cheek.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} offered Dr. No to Guy Green, Guy Hamilton, Val Guest and Ken Hughes to direct, {{but all of}} them {{turned it}} down. They finally signed Terence Young who had a long background with Broccoli's Warwick Films as the director. Broccoli and Saltzman felt that Young would {{be able to make a}} real impression of James Bond and transfer the essence of the character from book to film. Young imposed many stylistic choices for the character which continued throughout the film series. Young also decided to inject much humour, as he considered that [...] "a lot of things in this film, the sex and violence and so on, if played straight, a) would be objectionable, and b) we're never gonna go past the censors; but the moment you take the mickey out, put the <b>tongue</b> <b>out</b> in the cheek, it seems to disarm." ...|$|E

500|$|In the summer, the privations of the captivity, {{including}} their closer confinement at the Ipatiev House negatively affected the family. According to some accounts, {{at one point}} Anastasia became so upset about the locked, painted windows that she opened one to look outside and get fresh air. A sentry reportedly saw her and fired, narrowly missing her. She did not try again. On July 14, 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg conducted a private church service for the family. They reported that Anastasia and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead, and that the girls had become despondent and hopeless, and no longer sang the replies in the service. Noticing this dramatic change in their demeanor since his last visit, one priest told the other, [...] "Something has happened to them in there." [...] But the next day, on July 15, 1918, Anastasia and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked and helped move the beds in their shared bedroom so that cleaning women could clean the floors. They helped the women scrub the floors and whispered to them when the guards weren't watching. Anastasia stuck her <b>tongue</b> <b>out</b> at Yakov Yurovsky, {{the head of the}} detachment, when he momentarily turned his back and left the room.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are also}} some {{possible}} variations to emoticons to get new definitions, like changing a character to express a new feeling, or slightly change {{the mood of the}} emoticon.

Others include wink), a grin :D, smug :->, and <b>tongue</b> <b>out</b> :P, such as when blowing a raspberry.
