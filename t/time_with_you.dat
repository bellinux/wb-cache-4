[...] "One Last Time" [...] is a dance-pop and EDM-light song, with a total length of three minutes and seventeen seconds (3:17). Its instrumentations consist in [...] "pummeling drums and a three-note synth line". [...] "One Last Time" [...] is written in the key of A-flat major, with a moderately fast tempo of 125 beats per minute. Grande's vocals range from F#3 to C6. Lyrically, the song is about asking a former lover to spend one last <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> although he has already moved on and is with someone new. As noted by Jason Lipshut of Billboard, [...] "the downbeat admission of 'I know/that you got everything/But I got nothing here without you' is the pained sound of a narrator racked with guilt, the chorus sets aside that humiliation and scoops up a sense of hope," [...] with the singer pleading, [...] "One last time/I need {{to be the one}} who takes you home/One more time/I promise after that, I'll let you go". Rob Copsey of The Official Charts Company noted that the song [...] " [...] reminded him of Swedish's recording artist, Loreen's 2012 Eurovision winning song [...] "Euphoria".|$|E
