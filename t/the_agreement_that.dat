5|$|In 2010, the Bavarian Administrative Court {{ruled that}} a woman working in a children's daycare centre, whose {{employment}} had been terminated when her ex-husband identified her as a Scientologist, should be reinstated. The woman had demonstrated to the court's satisfaction that her Scientological beliefs were irrelevant to her work. According to <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>that</b> concluded the case, she promised not to use Scientology methods in her work, and to inform the children's parents of her membership in Scientology.|$|E
5|$|The new Contract Sejm, {{named for}} <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>that</b> {{had been reached}} by the {{communist}} party and the Solidarity movement during the Polish Round Table Talks, would be dominated by Solidarity.

However, the communist candidate for Prime Minister, Czesław Kiszczak, who replaced Mieczysław Rakowski, failed to gain enough support to form a government.|$|E
5|$|The victorious allies regrouped, {{although}} {{too slowly}} to intercept Rupert {{as he left}} York. Once the allied army had reformed (and had been joined by Meldrum's and Denbigh's forces) they resumed the siege of York.

5|$|Central to the 2009 dispute was <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>that</b> {{ended the}} 2007 round of strikes. The 2007 Pay and Modernisation Agreement saw the parties {{involved}} agree to a four-phase plan, which would be implemented with dialogue between both sides at each stage of the process. However, the Communication Workers Union said that although Royal Mail had carried out three of the phases in this way, it had refused to discuss the final phase, which concerned the government's plans for modernisation, and how these would affect the job security of Royal Mail employees.|$|E
5|$|In 1296, <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>that</b> had {{followed}} from the Great Cause between King Edward I and the King of the Scots, John Balliol, broke down. King Edward resolved to depose King John, invading the kingdom and beginning the Wars of Scottish Independence. Nicholas, as pastor of Calder-Comitis, swore fealty to King Edward at Berwick on 28 August 1296. His lands were restored thereafter, on 2 September, Edward having notionally confiscated all {{the lands of}} the Scottish clergy {{earlier in the year}} pending homage.|$|E

5|$|In 1828, Ibrahim Pasha thus {{found himself}} in a {{difficult}} situation: he had just suffered a defeat at Navarino; the joint fleet exercised a blockade which prevented him from receiving reinforcements and supplies; his Albanian troops, whom he could no longer pay, had returned to their country under the protection of Theodoros Kolokotronis’ Greek troops. On August 6, 1828, a convention had been signed at Alexandria between the viceroy of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, and the British admiral Edward Codrington. Ibrahim Pasha had to evacuate his Egyptian troops and leave the Peloponnese to the few Turkish troops (estimated at 1200 men) remaining there. However, Ibrahim Pasha refused to honor <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>that</b> had been reached, continuing to control various Greek regions: Messenia, Navarino, Patras and several other strongholds. He had also ordered the systematic destruction of Tripoli.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Sanders {{sold the}} company {{to a group of}} investors led by John Y. Brown Jr. and Jack C. Massey for US$2 million (around US$15 million in 2013).

Sanders died in 1980, his promotional work making him a prominent figure in American cultural history.

Distrustful of her ability to manage her finances, Wyatt made an arrangement with her sister Henrietta Lenhardt.

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 63 BC, Hybrida went to Etruria {{to assist}} the praetor, Quintus Metellus Celer, in {{preventing}} Catiline escaping through the Alps and into Gaul. Catiline, hoping that Hybrida might choose to help him, choose to engage him and his consular army rather than the forces under the praetor. Hybrida, however, had given command of the army to his legate, Marcus Petreius, having either suffered a bout of gout or pretending to have. Catiline put up his final resistance in Pistoria, Etruria with an army of 3000 men. Here, Petreius and his soldiers massacred the entire army, killed and beheaded Catiline, and then sent his head to Rome. Hybrida, having adhered to <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>that</b> he had with Cicero and the Senate, was granted the governorship of Macedonia {{at the end of}} his consulship.|$|E
5|$|With {{the export}} issue settled, GE and SNECMA {{finalized}} <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>that</b> formed CFM International (CFMI), a 50–50 joint company {{that would be}} responsible for producing and marketing the 10-ton engine, the CFM56. The venture was officially founded in 1974. The two primary roles for CFMI were to manage the program between GE and SNECMA, and to market, sell and service the engine at a single point of contact for the customer. CFMI was made responsible for the day-to-day decision making for the project, while major decisions (developing a new variant, for example) required the go-ahead from GE and SNECMA management.|$|E
5|$|In 1944 Australia's {{war effort}} {{was focused on}} the Pacific War, and most {{elements}} of the country's military were in Australia and the islands to its north. Nevertheless, substantial numbers of RAAF personnel, most of whom had been trained through the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), were stationed in the United Kingdom (UK) and took part in operations against Germany. The Australian Government had very little influence over where Australian graduates of EATS were posted, and many were assigned directly to British units. As of 6 June 1944, 1,816 Australian airmen (including 584 pilots) were posted to RAF squadrons. Many of the thousands of Australian ground crew in the UK at this time were also serving with RAF units. In addition, ten RAAF flying squadrons were stationed in the UK. These included one regular RAAF unit, No. 10Squadron, and nine temporary Article XV squadrons, which had been formed under <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>that</b> underpinned EATS. While the ArticleXV squadrons were nominally Australian, most included a substantial proportion of personnel from Britain and other Commonwealth countries; as of 1 June 1944 they were manned by 796 Australian aircrew and 572 airmen from other countries. Owing to an over-supply of aircrew trained through the Empire Air Training Scheme, there were also hundreds of RAAF airmen in the UK who were assigned to personnel depots while they waited to be posted to a combat unit; prior to the invasion these unattached airmen were considered an asset by the Allied air forces as they could rapidly replace casualties.|$|E

5|$|The Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set, {{released}} in 1977, was an introductory {{version of the}} original D geared towards new players and edited by J. Eric Holmes. But in the same year, TSR Hobbies released a completely new and complex version of D, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD). The Monster Manual, released later that year, became the first supplemental rule book of the new system, and many more followed. The AD rules were not fully compatible {{with those of the}} D Basic Set and as a result, D and AD became distinct product lines. Splitting the game lines created a further rift between Gygax and Arneson; although Arneson received a 10% royalty on sales of all D products, Gygax refused to pay him royalties on AD books, claiming it was a new and different property. In 1979, Arneson filed a lawsuit against TSR; it was eventually settled in March 1981 with <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>that</b> Arneson would receive a 2.5% royalty on all AD products, giving him a very comfortable six-figure annual income for the next decade.|$|E
