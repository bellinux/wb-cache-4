25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>my</b> lead.|$|E
500|$|By then, Rodham {{was viewed}} as someone with a bright {{political}} future. Democratic political organizer and consultant Betsey Wright had moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham's career. Wright thought she {{had the potential to}} become a future senator or president. Meanwhile, boyfriend Bill Clinton had repeatedly asked Rodham to marry him and she continued to demur. After failing the District of Columbia bar exam and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision. As she later wrote, [...] "I chose <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>my</b> heart instead of my head". She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, where career prospects were brighter. He was then teaching law and running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in his home state. In August 1974, Rodham moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas and became one of only two female faculty members in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.|$|E

He believes in me that much. I'm really blessed ... It's the most incredible gift that Mr Gibson could have given me." [...] She acknowledged to the Herald Sun that it was helpful to have Gibson's production company assist with her music career, [...] "If you think about it, every talent needs a serious push and help from somebody who is stronger, because it's pretty much impossible for anybody to succeed in this industry. So I've become very lucky, and I'm very grateful. You don't control the situations or the people you meet. I did not plan this. I'm just doing what I've always been doing. It's not like I've changed my goals at all." ...|$|E

500|$|While still {{performing}} as the vocalist of Icelandic alternative rock group the Sugarcubes, Björk approached both Ásmundur Jónsson of Bad Taste and producer Derek Birkett of One Little Indian Records with a demo cassette {{of her own}} songs on which she had been working. These demos included versions of songs that would appear on Debut, including [...] "The Anchor Song" [...] and [...] "Aeroplane". After the Sugarcubes went on hiatus, she moved to London, England, where she and Birkett worked {{on the details of}} what would become Debut. Björk has admitted that The Sugarcube's music was not her taste, and that her contact with London's underground club culture of the late 1980s/early 1990s helped her find her own musical identity. She said: [...] "...as a music nerd, I just had <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>my</b> heart, and my heart was those beats that were happening in England. And maybe what I'm understanding more and more as I get older, is that music like Kate Bush has really influenced me. Brian Eno. Acid. Electronic beats. Labels like Warp." ...|$|E
500|$|Rehman {{has said}} that, his [...] "sole purpose {{in trying to}} be a success as a {{professional}} footballer is to inspire other Asian players <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>my</b> lead and achieve their goals." [...] He is an ambassador for the Asian Football Network (AFN), a grassroots community-led initiative designed to support and facilitate the development of grassroots Asian football in the UK. He has also worked with the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) to try {{to increase the number of}} British Asians taking up a career in professional football, and has attended meetings with the PFA in order to achieve this goal. He has also been involved in the Show Racism the Red Card campaign and he has taken part in Chelsea's [...] "Search for an Asian Star" [...] campaign. On 12 July 2008, he took part in the Islam Expo event at the Olympia exhibition centre in West Kensington, London, a four-day event whose primary purpose was to build bridges between Britain's Muslim communities and the rest of society. Rehman took part in a panel giving feedback from his own experiences about the positive use of sport.|$|E

2500|$|The Syrian {{ambassador}} to Iraq, Nawaf al-Fares defected to the opposition. He {{is the most}} senior diplomat to defect {{so far in the}} entire conflict. He gave a statement to Al Jazeera, saying [...] "I urge all honest members of this party <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>my</b> path because the regime has turned it to an instrument to kill people and their aspiration to freedom." [...] Fares also called upon the military to join the ranks of the Syrian revolution. His defection dealt a [...] "moral and political blow" [...] to the Syrian Government and another diplomat, the Syrian {{ambassador to}} Sweden, Mohammad Bassam Imadi defected in December 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Roberto F. Canuto {{was born}} in Asturias, Spain. Since an early age he was curious for moviemaking.

2500|$|The {{circumstances}} in which the trial took place were unusual in that, while Lever’s legal team were accommodated at Thornton Manor, Lord Northcliffe, the principal witness for the defence, was overseas and, according to Jolly, “had no intention of returning within range of any writ server while the case was on.” It seems clear, therefore, that Northcliffe {{was in the wrong}} and, moreover, he knew that he would most probably lose the case: he reportedly offered Lever a public apology shortly {{before the start of the}} trial. For the plaintiff, Carson accused Associated Newspapers of conduction a malicious campaign ‘with the object of smashing up Lever Brothers.’ Speaking for more than five hours, he listed a number of complaints and asked the jury to award punitive damages. He then called Lever as his first witness, inviting the leader of the defence team to [...] "cross-examine him to his heart's content, and, when his time comes, I hope he will be able <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>my</b> example and do the same, and call as his first witness his own client, Lord Northcliffe..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Xu Yin (徐胤), the Army Inspector (監軍) of the Jin {{garrison}} at Badong (巴東), led marine forces towards Jianping (建平), while Yang Zhao (楊肇), the Inspector (刺史) of Jing Province (also under Jin control), led troops towards Xiling. Lu Kang gave orders as such: Zhang Xian {{to reinforce}} Jiangling's defences; Sun Zun (孫遵), the Commandant of Gong'an (公安), {{to patrol the}} south river bank and resist Yang Hu; naval commander Liu Lü (留慮) and General Who Guards the West (鎮西將軍) Zhu Wan (朱琬) to defend against Xu Yin. He personally led three armies to hold off Yang Zhao {{with the aid of}} the defensive structures they constructed earlier. However, Lu Kang's subordinates Zhu Qiao (朱喬) and Yu Zan (俞贊) defected to Yang Zhao's side instead. Lu Kang said, [...] "Yu Zan has been serving under {{me for a long time}} and he is very aware of my situation. He knows that the tribal soldiers in my army may be unwilling <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>my</b> orders, so he'll definitely suggest to the enemy to take advantage of this weakness." [...] Hence, that night, Lu Kang immediately replaced the tribal soldiers in his army with other veteran soldiers whom he trusted more. The following day, as Lu Kang expected, Yang Zhao concentrated his attacks on the unit in Lu Kang's army which used to be made up of tribal soldiers, without knowing that they had been replaced. Lu Kang ordered his archers to retaliate, raining arrows on the enemy and inflicting heavy casualties.|$|E
