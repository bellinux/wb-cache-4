2500|$|The Trecento was {{a period}} of {{vigorous}} activity in Italy in the arts, including painting, architecture, literature, and music. The music of the Trecento paralleled the achievements in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>arts</b> in many ways, for example, in pioneering new forms of expression, especially in secular song in the vernacular language, Italian. [...] In these regards, the music of the Trecento may seem more to be a Renaissance phenomenon; however, the predominant musical language was more closely related to that of the late Middle Ages, and musicologists generally classify the Trecento {{as the end of the}} medieval era. Trecento means [...] "three hundred" [...] in Italian but is usually used to refer to the 1300s. [...] However, the greatest flowering of music in the Trecento happened late in the century, and the period is usually extended to include music up to around 1420.|$|E
2500|$|While status {{arising from}} {{patronage}} from the Church and State continued {{with the rise}} of Enlightenment and capitalism (e.g.,the position of architect Christopher Wren in the patronage of the British Crown, the City of London, the Church of England and Oxford University during the 17thcentury), there was an expansion in artistic and architectural services available, each competing for commissions with the growth of industry and the middle-classes. Architects nevertheless remained essentially servants to their clients: while Romanticism and Modernism in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>arts</b> encouraged individualism, progress in architecture was geared mostly to improvements in building performance (standards of comfort), engineering and the development of new building typologies (e.g.,factories, railway stations, and later airports) and public benevolence (the problems of urbanization, [...] "public housing", overcrowding, etc.), yet allowing some architects to concern themselves with architecture as an autonomous art (as flourished with Art Nouveau and Art Deco). The heroes of modern architecture, in particular Le Corbusier, were seen as heroic for generating theories about how architecture should be concerned with the development of society.|$|E
2500|$|File sharing is {{an example}} of {{transferring}} large amounts of data across the Internet. A computer file can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server for easy download by others. It can be put into a [...] "shared location" [...] or onto a file server for instant use by colleagues.

In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user authentication, the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by encryption, and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed– usually fully encrypted– across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by digital signatures or by MD5 or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission.
