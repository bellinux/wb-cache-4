25|$|The male Eciton burchellii are {{extremely}} {{affected by a}} fragmented forest habitat. Even though the males can fly, their dispersal {{is limited by the}} predation of nocturnal insectivores <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> spot their larger bodies in the cleared forest patches. Also, the males seem to have no defenses, which contrasts greatly with the queen's hordes of stinging protectors. With the fragmented forest hindering the males' dispersal, gene flow is reduced among the Eciton burchellii populations.|$|E
25|$|A mouse-related {{controller}} {{called the}} SpaceBall has a ball placed above the work surface <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> be gripped.

In November 2010 a German Company called Axsotic introduced a new concept of 3D mouse called 3D Spheric Mouse. This new concept of a true six degree-of-freedom input device uses a ball to rotate in 3 axes without any limitations.|$|E

25|$|The Clock drawing test (CDT) {{is a brief}} {{cognitive}} {{task that}} can be used by physicians who suspect neurological dysfunction based on history and physical examination. It is relatively easy to train non-professional staff to administer a CDT. Therefore, this is a test <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> be administered in educational and geriatric settings and can be utilized as a precursory measure to indicate the likelihood of further/future deficits. Also, generational, educational and cultural differences are not perceived as impacting the utility of the CDT.|$|E
25|$|Orion's seven {{brightest}} stars form a distinctive hourglass-shaped asterism, or pattern, {{in the night}} sky. Four stars—Rigel, Betelgeuse, Bellatrix and Saiph—form a large roughly rectangular shape, in the centre of which lie the three stars of Orion's Belt—Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka. Coincidentally, these seven stars {{are among the most}} distant <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> be seen with the naked eye. Descending from the 'belt' is a smaller line of three stars (the middle of which is in fact not a star but the Orion Nebula), known as the hunter's 'sword'.|$|E
25|$|Brown {{catsharks}} have long, slender {{bodies with}} broad, bell-shaped snouts. They are dark brown with light-colored markings on the posterior margins of their fins. Their bodies {{are soft and}} flabby, with a weak skin <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> be harmed. Brown catsharks' two dorsal fins are {{the same size and}} do not have spines. The first dorsal fin originates {{to the front of the}} pelvic fin and the second dorsal fin is located in front of the anal fin's insertion. They typically reach a maximum size of 68cm in total length, but they average between 30 and 60cm.|$|E

25|$|The {{index of}} a {{differential}} operator {{is closely related}} to the number of independent solutions (more precisely, it is the differences of the numbers of independent solutions of the differential operator and its adjoint). There are many hard and fundamental problems in mathematics <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> be reduced to the problem of finding the number of independent solutions of some differential operator, so if one has some means of finding the index of a differential operator these problems can often be solved. This is what the Atiyah–Singer index theorem does: it gives a formula for the index of certain differential operators, in terms of topological invariants that look quite complicated but are in practice usually straightforward to calculate.|$|E
25|$|Quiz shows {{virtually}} {{disappeared from}} prime time American television for decades. Those that continued to air had substantially reduced prizes, and many shows adopted {{limits on the}} number of games a player could win (usually five). Quiz shows became game shows, shifting focus from knowledge to puzzles and word games. NBC's comedy/game show Jackpot Bowling and ABC's more serious Make That Spare! were the only big-money game shows still on television after the fallout; as bowling is not a game <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> be rigged for television, those shows continued to air into the early 1960s. A quiz for big money would not return until ABC premiered 100 Grand in 1963; it went off the air after three weeks.|$|E
25|$|One {{must not}} mistake the Mozartian {{dramatic}} coloratura soprano with the Italian dramatic coloratura soprano. A singer that sings Konstanze, Donna Anna or Fiordiligi can not necessarily sing the Italian dramatic coloratura parts, due to other vocal demands. Imogene, Leonora and Violetta require a dramatic soprano voice and {{are most often}} sung by dramatic sopranos with an agile voice <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> produce coloratura and high notes. Roles like Norma, Lady Macbeth, Odabella or Abigaille are good examples of Italian roles that are not necessarily a coloratura soprano (even though the score calls for coloratura singing), but a full bodied dramatic soprano with a voice that can handle extreme dramatic singing and that is flexible enough to sing coloratura. Giuseppe Verdi wrote many parts like this in his early years.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds and levels of loss in Albee’s play A Delicate Balance. Most obvious {{is the loss of}} balance that has been precariously maintained by Agnes, the main character in the play and mistress of the house in which the play takes place. Agnes begins the play musing about sanity, a condition, at least in Agnes’s mind, <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> be lost. Agnes wonders what would happen if she were to lose her sense of the rational. Who would take care of things? The way in which Agnes maintains the delicate balance in her home, as well as the delicate balance of her sanity, is to lose contact with her own emotional reality. She also tries to convince everyone else to suppress his or her emotions. Agnes believes that by saying that the emotions are gone, circumstances will return to some condition that resembles normalcy.|$|E
25|$|The Duke of York {{decided to}} exploit this {{numerical}} superiority {{as soon as}} possible. He therefore prepared for {{an attack on a}} broad front. To understand the problems this attack encountered one needs to understand the peculiar nature of the terrain. The North Holland peninsula is bordered on the North-Sea side by a beach and a broad band of dunes (except for a short stretch south of Petten, where only a large dike defends the hinterland against flooding). Next to the dunes is a band of high land <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> be traversed by a marching army. Further east, the terrain changes to former bogland and other low-lying areas consisting of former lakes that had been drained by the Dutch in the 17th century. These low-lying areas were criss-crossed by ditches and larger drainage canals, needed in the water-management of the area, that formed serious impediments to manoeuvring forces, even when they were not inundated. Such inundations were increasingly performed by the Dutch engineers the more the campaign progressed, to deny more and more freedom of movement to the Anglo-Russian forces. At the time of the Battle of Bergen that commenced on 19 September, most of those inundations were not yet completed, so that at that time the main obstacles were still the watercourses.|$|E
25|$|The {{gameplay}} of Dragon Quest {{itself was}} non-linear, {{with most of}} the game not blocked in any way other than by being infested with monsters <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> kill an unprepared player. This was balanced by the use of bridges to signify a change in difficulty and a new level progression that departed from D, where in the 1st and 2nd editions, players are given random initial stats and a constant growth rate. Dragon Quest instead gave the player some extra hit points at the start and a level progression where the effective rate of character growth decelerates over time, similar to how the more recent editions of D have balanced the gameplay. Dragon Quest also gave players a clear objective {{from the start of the}} game and a series of smaller scenarios to build up the player's strength in order to achieve that objective. The ending could also be altered depending on the moral dialogue choice of whether or not the protagonist should join the antagonist on his evil conquest towards the end of the game. The game also had a limited inventory requiring item management, while the caves were dark, requiring the use of a torch to display a field of vision around the character. With Dragon Quest becoming widely popular in Japan, such that local municipalities were forced to place restrictions on where and when the game could be sold, the Dragon Quest series is still considered a bellwether for the Japanese video game market. Dragon Quest did not reach North America until 1989, when it was released as Dragon Warrior, the first NES RPG to be released in North America. The release of Dragon Quest was followed by NES remakes of the early Wizardry and Ultima titles over the next several years by Pony Canyon.|$|E
