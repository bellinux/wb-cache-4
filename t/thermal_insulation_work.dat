Since simulations based on the default wax parameters did not achieve a complete match with experiments, it was important to find out to what extent tuning of wax parameters was necessary. Three scenarios were created to match the experimental wax thickness, including studying the effect of changing wax porosity in OLGA, changing the crude oil components and the influence of simulation time on wax deposition.
