5|$|By the 18th century, {{the prison}} had {{separate}} areas for its {{two classes of}} prisoner: the master's side, which housed about 50rooms for rent, and <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>or</b> poor side, consisting of nine small rooms, or wards, into which 300people were confined from dusk until dawn. Room rents on the master's side were ten shillings a week in 1728, with most prisoners forced to share. John Baptist Grano paid 2s 6d (two shillings and six pennies) for a room with two beds on the master's side, shared with three other prisoners: Daniel Blunt, a tailor who owed £9, Benjamin Sandford, a lighterman from Bermondsey who owed £55, and a Mr. Blundell, a jeweller. Women prisoners who could pay the fees were housed in the women's quarters, known as the oak. The wives, daughters and lovers of male prisoners were allowed to live with them, if someone was paying their way.|$|E

25|$|British Prime Ministers {{have never}} been elected {{directly}} by the public. A Prime Minister {{need not be a}} party leader; David Lloyd George was not a party leader during his service as prime Minister during World War I, and neither was Ramsay MacDonald from 1931 to 1935. Prime Ministers have taken office because they were members of either <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> <b>or</b> Lords, and either inherited a majority in <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> <b>or</b> won more seats than the opposition in a general election.|$|R
25|$|The Manorial Court {{which had}} ceased to operate during the early 19th century as the Church Vestry and later parish {{meetings}} held greater sway, was revived by Henry Turner.

25|$|It {{is often}} {{treated as a}} {{subspecies}} of <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>or</b> black-winged stilt, using the trinomial name Himantopus himantopus mexicanus. However, the AOS has always considered it a species in its own right, and the scientific name Himantopus mexicanus is often seen. Matters are more complicated though; sometimes all five distinct lineages of the Common Stilt are treated as different species. But the white-backed stilt from southern South America (H. melanurus when the species is recognized), parapatric and intergrading to some extent with its northern relative where their ranges meet, would warrant inclusion with the Black-necked stilt when this is separated specifically, becoming Himantopus mexicanus melanurus. Similarly, the Hawaiian stilt, H. m. knudseni, is likely {{to belong to the}} American species when this is considered separate; while some treat it as another distinct species, the AOS, BirdLife International and the IUCN do not.|$|E
25|$|It nests on the ground, near {{water and}} under cover. The pairs {{form in the}} winter {{quarters}} and arrive on the breeding grounds together, starting about March. The breeding starts some weeks thereafter, not until May in the most northernly locations. The nest is a deep hollow lined with dry leaves and down feathers, built in dense vegetation near water. After the females have started laying, the males leave them and move away for shorter or longer distances, assembling in flocks on particular lakes where they moult into eclipse plumage; they will usually encounter their offspring only in winter quarters. The clutch may consist of 5–16 eggs, but usually numbers 8–11; they are incubated for 21–23 days. The young leave the nest soon after hatching and are attended by the mother for about 25–30 days, after which they fledge. The drakes and the hens with young generally move to the winter quarters separately. After the first winter, the young moult into adult plumage. The maximum recorded lifespan – {{though it is not}} clear whether this refers to <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>or</b> the green-winged teal—was over 27 years, which is rather high for such a small bird.|$|E

500|$|The popular {{periodic}} table layout, {{also known as}} <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>or</b> standard form (as shown at various other points in this article), is attributable to Horace Groves Deming. In 1923, Deming, an American chemist, published short (...) and medium (...) form {{periodic table}}s. Merck and Company prepared a handout form of Deming's 18-column medium table, in 1928, which was widely circulated in American schools. By the 1930s Deming's table was appearing in handbooks and encyclopaedias of chemistry. It was also distributed for many years by the Sargent-Welch Scientific Company.|$|E
500|$|The sagas {{incorrectly}} {{claim that}} the Earl of Orkney was called [...] "Turf-Einarr" [...] because he introduced the practice of burning turf or peat to the islands since wood was so scarce. This practice long pre-dates the Norse and {{the real reason for}} the nickname is unknown. The Orkneyinga saga has him organising peat cutting at Tarbat Ness far to the south of the Orkney heartland. While depletion of woodland could have caused a cultural shift from burning timber to peat, potentially the name arose because the sequestration of <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>or</b> allodial rights of the islanders by Einarr forced them away from coppicing towards cutting turves.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the hidden}} city of Gondolin, an {{isolated}} land, a peculiar Elvish dialect developed: [...] "This {{differed from the}} standard (of Doriath) (a) in having Western and some Northern elements, and (b) in incorporating a good many Noldorin-Quenya words in more or less Sindarized forms.

2500|$|The herpetologist Laurence Monroe Klauber proposed, in a tongue-in-cheek article which blames Dr. Watson {{for getting}} {{the name of the}} snake wrong, a theory that the swamp adder was an {{artificial}} hybrid between the Mexican Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) and Naja naja. His speculation suggests that Doyle might have hidden a double-meaning in Holmes' words. What Holmes said, reported by Watson, was [...] "It is a swamp adder, the deadliest snake in India"; but Klauber suggested what Holmes really said was [...] "It is a samp-aderm, the deadliest skink in India." [...] Samp-aderm can be translated [...] "snake-Gila-monster": Samp is Hindi for snake, and the suffix aderm is derived from heloderm, <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>or</b> vernacular name of the Gila monster generally used by European naturalists. Skinks are lizards of the family Scincidae, many of which are snake-like in form. Such a hybrid reptile will have a venom incomparably strengthened by hybridization, assuring the almost instant demise of the victim. And it will also have ears like any lizard, so it could hear the whistle, and legs and claws allowing it to run up and down the bell cord with a swift ease.|$|E
