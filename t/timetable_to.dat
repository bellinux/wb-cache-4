The samples need to be kept in a cold environment, and in the event weather delayed the landing, the team evaluated the best way to preserve the samples. The team approved a revised flight plan that allows Discovery to delay hatch closure and undocking slightly, to allow the samples to be kept inside the station's freezer longer, while still protecting the landing date of 28 March. Instead of closing the hatch the night before undocking, the hatch would be closed on the same day, flight day eleven.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Midway is {{generally}} considered to be the turning point of the war in the Pacific. Before Midway, a small and fractional U.S. Navy faced an overwhelmingly larger and battle-hardened Japanese Combined Fleet. After Midway, although the Japanese still held a temporary advantage in vessels and planes, the U.S. Navy and the nation gained confidence and, most critically, time. The setback in the Japanese <b>timetable</b> <b>to</b> encircle the Pacific gave the U.S. industrial machine time to crank up war production, and ultimately, to turn the advantage on Japan in the production of ships, planes, guns, and all the other matériel of war. The Battle of Midway infused the U.S. Pacific Navy with confidence. And with this battle the American forces gained, and afterwards continued to gain, hard combat experience; so the Japanese lost that crucial advantage as well.|$|E

25|$|By 1923, the A2 class 4-6-0 locomotives, which dated back to 1907, were {{frequently}} double-heading on interstate expresses to Serviceton and Albury as increasing traffic saw loads exceed the eight car maximum {{of a single}} A2 on these services. The Victorian Railways Commissioners recommended considerably more powerful locomotives to haul trains of up to eleven cars unassisted over the ruling gradients on these lines. The S class 4-6-2 Pacifics displaced the A2s from North East line express services from 1928 onwards and allowed a faster <b>timetable</b> <b>to</b> be introduced. However a Pacific-type locomotive was not particularly well suited to the Western line. The section between Melbourne and Ballarat had sharply curved, steep inclines, the most notorious {{of which was the}} , 1 in 48 (2.08&) ruling gradient of the Ingliston Bank. As early as 1923 VR locomotive designers were considering 4-8-2 Mountain-type locomotives for this purpose, along {{with the use of a}} third cylinder to allow increased power to be achieved without breaching the loading gauge.|$|E

At 04:40, Norwegian searchlights again illuminated the ship and at 04:21 the [...] guns of Oscarsborg Fortress opened fire on Blücher at very close range, beginning the Battle of Drøbak Sound with two hits on her port side. The first was high above the bridge, hitting the battle station for the commander of the anti-aircraft guns, killing AO II Kapitänleutnant Hans-Erich Pochhammer. The main range finder {{in the top of the}} battle mast was knocked out of alignment, but Blücher had four more major rangefinders (B-turret, on the bridge roof, the aft battle station (Nachtstand) and C-turret) and many smaller [...] on the bridge and the four rangefinder stations for the AA. The commander in D-turret, Oberstückmeister Waldeck, stated that the first 28cm hit had no influence on the battle capability of the 20.3cm guns. Blücher immediately returned fire.|$|E
