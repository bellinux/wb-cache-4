6000|$|The decisive cabinet was on Saturday, April 16. It {{was finally}} settled {{that the budget}} should be {{proposed}} as it stood, with its essential features unaltered. On Sunday, the chancellor of the exchequer went as usual twice to church, and read the Paradiso; 'but I was obliged,' he says, with an accent of contrition, 'to give several hours to my figures.' Monday brought the critical moment. 'April 18. Wrote minutes. Read Shakespeare at night. This day was devoted to working up my papers and figures for the evening. Then drove and walked with C. [Mrs. Gladstone]. Went at 4½ to the House. Spoke 4¾ hours in detailing <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>measures,</b> and my strength stood out well, thank God. Many kind congratulations afterwards. Herberts and Wortleys came home with us and had soup and negus.' ...|$|E
6000|$|They were chequered, {{and they}} were {{peculiar}} in this, that the [...] first blow struck was delivered {{by one of the}} best among its [...] friends. Lord John Russell, keenly alive to the discredit of any [...] tampering as in former years with the question of the franchise, [...] insisted on introducing his Reform bill on March 1, when the [...] treaty and the financial proposals of the year, numerous and [...] complex as they were, had not proceeded beyond their early stages. [...] This was in flat violation of a rule of Lord Bacon’s, even more [...] weighty now than in his time, which Sir James Graham was fond of [...] quoting: “Never overlap business.” The enemies of the treaty were [...] thus invited to obstruct it through prolonged debating on reform, [...] and the enemies of reform to discharge a corresponding office by [...] prolonged debating on the finance. A large majority of the House [...] were in disguised hostility to the extension of the franchise. The [...] discussions on it were at once protracted, intermittent, and [...] languid. No division was taken against it. It was defeated by the [...] pure vis inertiæ of the House skilfully applied: and it was [...] withdrawn on June 11. But it had done its work, by delaying the [...] tail of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>measures</b> until a time when the marriage [...] effected by the treaty between England and France had outlived its [...] parliamentary honeymoon. There had intervened the Savoy and Nice [...] explosion; settlement with China was uncertain; the prospects of [...] the harvest were bad; French invasion was apprehended by many men [...] usually rational. The Paper Duty bill, which would have passed the [...] Commons by a large majority in the beginning of March, only [...] escaped defeat on May 8 by a majority of nine.(22) ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{hostilities}} in China {{reached a}} rather early termination, and [...] {{in the early}} part of the session of 1861 it appeared almost [...] certain that there would be a surplus for 1861-2 such as I thought [...] would make it possible again to operate on the paper duties. [...] Unfortunately, the income tax was at so high a rate that we could [...] not reasonably hope to carry paper duty repeal without taking a [...] penny off the tax. The double plan strained the probable means [...] afforded by the budget. In this dilemma I received most valuable [...] aid from the shrewd ingenuity of Milner Gibson, who said: Why not [...] fix the repeal of the paper duty at a later date than had been [...] intended, say on the 10th of October, which will reduce the loss [...] for the year? I gladly adopted the proposition, and proposed a [...] budget reducing the income tax by one penny, and repealing the [...] paper duties from October 10, 1861. With this was combined what [...] was more essential than either—the adoption of a new practice with [...] respect to finance, which would combine all <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>measures</b> [...] of the year in a single bill. We had separate discussions in the [...] cabinet on the constitutional proposal [the single bill]. It was [...] not extensively resisted there, though quietly a good deal [...] misliked. I rather think the chancellor, Campbell, took strong [...] objection to it; and I well remember that the Duke of Newcastle [...] gave valuable and telling aid. So it was adopted. The budget was [...] the subject of a fierce discussion, in which Lord Palmerston [...] appeared to me to lose his temper for the first and only time. The [...] plan, however, to my great delight, was adopted. It was followed [...] by a strange and painful incident. I received with astonishment [...] from Lord Palmerston, immediately after the adoption of the [...] budget, a distinct notice that he should not consider it a cabinet [...] question in the House of Commons, where it was known that the [...] opposition and the paper makers would use every effort to destroy [...] the plan. I wrote an uncontroversial reply (with some [...] self-repression) and showed it to Granville, who warmly approved, [...] and was silent on the letter of Lord Palmerston. The battle in [...] parliament was hard, but was as nothing to the internal fighting; [...] and we won it. We likewise succeeded in the plan of uniting the [...] financial proposals in one bill. To this Spencer Walpole gave [...] honourable support; and it became a standing rule. The House of [...] Lords, for its misconduct, was deservedly extinguished, in effect, [...] as to all matters of finance.|$|E
