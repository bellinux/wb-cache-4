5|$|<b>The</b> <b>streetcar</b> {{system was}} built by Twin City Rapid Transit and {{operated}} efficiently through 1949, with a program of reinvesting their profits into system improvements. However, in 1949, New York investor Charles Green gained control of the system, halted the rebuilding program, and announced a goal of completely converting the system to buses by 1958. These policies alienated the public and he was ousted in 1951, but his successor, Fred Ossanna, continued to cut service and replace the system with buses. On June 19, 1954, the last streetcar took its run. A photo taken in 1954 shows James Towley handing Fred Ossanna a check while one of the streetcars burned in the background. Later on, {{it was discovered that}} Ossanna and associates had plundered <b>the</b> <b>streetcar</b> system for personal gain. A small section of the line between Lake Calhoun and Lake Harriet is now operated by the Minnesota Streetcar Museum.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the subway}} was built, the Bloor {{streetcar}} line operated {{along the route}} between Jane Street and Luttrell Avenue. Paired PCC streetcars or multiple units (MUs) operated from 1950 {{to the opening of}} the subway line in 1966. The TTC favoured this route because the Prince Edward Viaduct made it easier to build a subway across the Don Valley, and <b>the</b> <b>streetcar</b> that ran along the route was filled with passengers travelling from East York and Scarborough. To provide relief to this streetcar line and {{to make it easier to}} expand into the suburbs, the line was built under Bloor street and Danforth Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} rapid {{industrial}} growth that began in Indiana during the gas boom of the late 19th-century, labor unions began to form with goals of increasing wages and providing other benefits to workers through collective bargaining. The Indianapolis Traction and Terminal Company was founded to own and operate <b>the</b> <b>streetcar</b> terminal in downtown Indianapolis, and operate the Indianapolis Street Railway under a lease agreement for a term of 31 years. In 1892 the employees of Indianapolis Traction and Terminal Company launched a short-lived strike. The company was the primary public transportation provider in Indianapolis and operated the central transportation hub {{for the city of}} Indianapolis and state of Indiana. The company offered small concessions, and the workers returned to work without unionizing.|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the signaling control strategies giving priority to <b>the</b> <b>streetcars</b> at an intersection in Hiroshima City and carried out a computer-aided experiment by using VISSIM 1), 2). The first observation from the study is that the proposed signaling strategy improves the traffic situation of <b>the</b> <b>streetcars.</b> Secondly, <b>the</b> traffic situation of the automobiles may become worse. Thirdly when dealing with the whole network, the proposed signaling strategy improves the traffic situation of both <b>the</b> <b>streetcars</b> and <b>the</b> automobiles...|$|R
50|$|While {{future plans}} for the line were determined, <b>the</b> <b>streetcars</b> were stored in an old {{warehouse}} in SoDo {{for more than a}} decade. In 2015, the Federal Transit Administration informed King County that if <b>the</b> <b>streetcars</b> are not put back in service soon, Metro would need to pay $205,000 to compensate the agency for its remaining investment in the cars. At the same time, the warehouse used to store <b>the</b> <b>streetcars</b> was in poor condition and the land needed for expansion of a neighboring bus base.|$|R

5|$|The {{success of}} the {{suburban}} lines tempted KES to extend their streetcar service west from Skøyen as a suburban line; the Lilleaker Line opened to Lilleaker in 1919, to Avløs in 1924 and to Kolsås in 1930. A new section from Jar to Sørbyhaugen opened in 1942, connecting the line from Jar to Kolsås to Nationaltheatret, and making it a rapid transit and the replacement of stock with wide suburban standard. This service remained part of the municipal Oslo Sporveier, that had bought all <b>the</b> <b>streetcar</b> companies in 1924.|$|E
25|$|The {{portion of}} <b>the</b> <b>streetcar</b> route within Downtown and the Pearl District of <b>the</b> <b>streetcar</b> route used to lie within TriMet's Fareless Square, later {{known as the}} Free Rail Zone.

25|$|In February 2017, the Village Voice {{examined}} the BQX project's cost {{and found that}} the city had only tenuous sources of funding for the project. The Voice study found that the neighborhoods along the proposed BQX pay a combined $1 billion annually in residential taxes, with the tax revenue having increased 17% since 2015. However, to pay for the BQX, <b>the</b> <b>streetcar</b> alone would need to raise tax by another 17%, or else the city would need to resort to financing <b>the</b> <b>streetcar</b> out of its own budget. In addition, there would be less benefit in building in already-gentrified neighborhoods than in neighborhoods that are gentrifying or being redeveloped. The streetcar's feasibility study estimated that property values would go up even without <b>the</b> <b>streetcar.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{originally}} built, <b>the</b> <b>streetcars</b> {{operated by}} <b>the</b> Toledo Railways & Light Company shared the bridge with motor vehicles.The technique employed to keep <b>the</b> <b>streetcar's</b> power wire taut when in use, yet allowing {{the bridge to}} be raised, was considered innovative and was copied in similar bridges.The bridge's original deck was an open metal mesh.|$|R

50|$|With the {{electrification}} of cities, {{large and}} small, came <b>the</b> electric <b>streetcar.</b> In Montreal, <b>the</b> horse car was withdrawn from service in 1894 {{and replaced with}} <b>the</b> electric <b>streetcar,</b> operated by <b>the</b> Montreal Street Railway Company from that date until 1911. Many of <b>the</b> <b>streetcars</b> were manufactured by Canadian Car and Foundry of Montreal and the Ottawa Car Company. In Toronto, the horse car gave way to <b>the</b> electric <b>streetcar</b> in 1892, with that service being offered by the Toronto Railway Company from 1891-1921.|$|R
