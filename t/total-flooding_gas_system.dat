The full extents of the <b>gas</b> <b>systems</b> are 0. 1 to 3. 5 kpc, and the masses of the gas, log Mgas [M⊙], are 4. 2 to 7. 2. The AGN activity is well correlated with existence of the <b>gas</b> <b>systems.</b> None of galaxies without the <b>gas</b> <b>systems</b> show the AGN activity. On the other hand, some galaxies with the <b>gas</b> <b>systems</b> show the AGN activity; optical AGN activities are shown in 5 out of 11 galaxies of which AGNs are optically studied, and radio activities are shown in 6 out of 14 galaxies.

30|$|The {{increasing}} {{adoption of}} gas-fired power plants directly strengthens the coupling between electric power and natural <b>gas</b> <b>systems.</b> Current industrial practice in optimal power flow for electric power systems {{has not taken}} the security constraints of <b>gas</b> <b>systems</b> into consideration, resulting in an overly-optimistic solution. Meanwhile, the operation of electric power and natural <b>gas</b> <b>systems</b> is coupled over multiple periods because of the ramp rate limits of power generators and the slow dynamical characteristics of <b>gas</b> <b>systems.</b> Based on these motivations, we propose a multi-period integrated natural gas and electric power system probabilistic optimal power flow (M-GEPOPF) model, which includes dynamic gas flow models. To address the uncertainties originating from wind power and load forecasting, a probabilistic optimal power flow (POPF) calculation based on a three-point estimate method (3 PEM) is adopted. Moreover, power-to-gas (PtG) units are employed to avoid wind power curtailment and enable flexible bi-directional energy flows between the coupled energy systems. An integrated IEEE RTS 24 -bus electric power system and the Belgian 20 -node natural <b>gas</b> <b>system</b> are employed as a test case to verify {{the applicability of the}} proposed M-GEPOPF model, and to demonstrate the potential economic benefits of PtG units.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Daya Bay Antineutrino Detector <b>gas</b> <b>system</b> is {{designed}} to protect the liquid scin-tillator targets of the antineutrino detectors against degradation and contamination from exposure to ambient laboratory air. The <b>gas</b> <b>system</b> is also used to monitor the leak tightness of the antineu-trino detector assembly. The cover <b>gas</b> <b>system</b> constantly flushes the gas volumes above the liquid scintillator with dry nitrogen to minimize oxidation of the scintillator over the five year lifetime of the experiment. This constant flush also prevents the infiltration of radon or other contaminants into these detecting liquids keeping the internal backgrounds low. Since the Daya Bay antineutrino detectors are immersed in the large water pools of the muon veto <b>system,</b> other <b>gas</b> volumes are needed to protect vital detector cables or gas lines. These volumes are also purged with dry gas. Return gas is monitored for oxygen content and humidity to provide early warning of potentially damaging leaks.

40|$|AbstractThis paper aims at {{analysing}} {{the impacts}} of interdependencies between electricity and natural <b>gas</b> <b>systems</b> in terms of security of energy supply. When analysing both systems several interdependencies can be observed, however, the most significant interdependencies are as follows: (1) gas dependency of gas fired power plants in electricity system and (2) electric dependency of electric-driven compressors in <b>gas</b> <b>system.</b> Since both systems depend on each other, it is of major interest from an energy security perspective to investigate how failures triggered in either of the systems propagate from one system to the other. We proposed an integrated simulation model that aims at reflecting {{the dynamics of the}} systems in case of disruptions and takes the cascading effects of these disruptions into account. While developing the integrated model, first electricity and <b>gas</b> <b>systems</b> are modelled separately and then linked by an (MATLAB-based) interface. The effectiveness of the proposed model is investigated using characteristic disruption scenarios. Computational results demonstrate that the integrated simulation model is very user-friendly and quite effective and efficient in analysing the interactions between electricity and <b>gas</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

50|$|In 2006, the ISA 84 {{committee}} {{developed a}} working group to study {{the issue of how}} fire and <b>gas</b> <b>systems</b> should be treated with respect to the IEC 61511 standard for safety instrumented systems. Many industry practitioners were having trouble utilizing the IEC 61511 standard for the design of fire and <b>gas</b> <b>systems</b> for two reasons: fire and <b>gas</b> <b>systems</b> are not 100% effective in detecting fires and gas releases (i.e., coverage is not 100%), and even if a fire or gas release is detected, the consequences of the incident are not prevented, they are only reduced (i.e., mitigative). As a result, the techniques and metrics shown in IEC 61511 are not adequate to perform fire and <b>gas</b> <b>system</b> design. The ISA 84 committee formed {{a working group}} to study the issue. In 2010, this working group released the first version of the ISA 84.00.07 technical report that laid out new techniques and metrics that were required to effectively design FGS systems using the performance based techniques that underpin the IEC 61511 standard.|$|R
