50|$|Wave field {{synthesis}} is {{a spatial}} audio rendering technique that synthesizes wave fronts by using Huygens-Fresnel principle. First the original sound is recorded by microphone arrays and then loudspeaker arrays {{are used to}} reproduce the sound in the listening area. The arrays are placed along the boundaries of their own area. Microphones and loudspeakers {{are the same as}} the arrays with regard to their respective area. <b>The</b> <b>different</b> <b>part</b> this technique has is that it allows multiple listeners to move in the listening area and still hear the same sound from all directions. This is the unique thing that the binaural and transaural techniques can't achieve. Generally, the sound reproduction systems using wave field synthesis place the loudspeakers in a line or around the listener in a 2D space. And similar systems are also proposed to reproduce a sound field in a 3D space. However, since these systems are very expensive and the loudspeakers are visible in the listener’s field of vision, {{it is very difficult to}} construct an audio-visual system using these systems. So papers on how to reduce the number of microphones and loudspeakers have been written. One of them achieve their goal by considering the auditory capability of the listeners.|$|E
5000|$|The Fornacalia was an Ancient Roman {{religious}} festival {{celebrated in}} honour of the goddess Fornax, a divine personification of the oven (fornax), and {{was related to the}} proper baking of bread. Ovid wrote that [...] "the oven was made a goddess, Fornax: the farmers, pleased with her, prayed she’d regulate the grain’s heat." [...] It was held in early February on various dates in different curiae, [...] which in the period of the Roman monarchy and the Roman Republic were the thirty wards of the city of Rome. It was proclaimed every year by the curio maximus, who was a priest who {{was the head of the}} curiae. He announced <b>the</b> <b>different</b> <b>part</b> which each curia (sing. of curiae) had to take in the celebration of the festival; [...] "now the Curio Maximus, in a set form of words, declares the shifting date of the Fornacalia, the Feast of Ovens, and round the Forum hang many tablets, on which every ward displays its particular sign." [...] It is believed that every family in the curia brought far (spelt, a kind of grain), to be toasted in the meeting hall and sacrificed to ensure that bread in the household ovens wouldn’t be burnt in the coming year. The last day of this festival was the quirinalia, which was also jokingly nicknamed the 'feast of fools'. All the curiae met together on that day for a collective feast. Those who did not know to what curia they belonged were able to participate in its rites; [...] "foolish people don’t know which is their ward, so they hold the feast on the last possible day. This tradition indicates that in later times membership of a curia (singular of curiae) had little significance to most Romans, so much so that some people did not which curia they belonged to; the curiae included all citizens and that every Roman citizen was deemed to belong to a curia, even if he did not know which it was." ...|$|E
