5|$|Carlos {{arranged}} bus and plane {{travel for}} his team and 42 of the original 63 hostages, with stops in Algiers and Tripoli, planning to fly eventually to Baghdad, where Yamani and Amuzegar were to be killed. All 30 non-Arab hostages were released in Algiers, excluding Amuzegar. Additional hostages were released at another stop in Tripoli before returning to Algiers. With only 10 hostages remaining, Carlos held a phone conversation with Algerian President Houari Boumédienne, who informed Carlos that the oil ministers' deaths would result in {{an attack on the}} plane. Boumédienne must also have offered Carlos asylum at this time and possibly financial compensation for failing to complete his assignment. Carlos expressed his regret at not being able to murder Yamani and Amuzegar, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his comrades left the plane. All the hostages and terrorists walked away from the situation, two days after it began.|$|E

5|$|Longstreet's {{attack was}} delayed, however, because he {{first had to}} wait for his final brigade (Evander M. Law's, Hood's division) to arrive, and then he was forced to march on a long, {{circuitous}} route that could not be seen by Union Army Signal Corps observers on Little Round Top. It was 4 p.m. by the time his two divisions reached their jumping off points, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his generals were astonished to find the III Corps planted directly in front of them on the Emmitsburg Road. Hood argued with Longstreet that this new situation demanded a change in tactics; he wanted to swing around, below and behind, Round Top and hit the Union Army in the rear. Longstreet, however, refused to consider such a modification to Lee's order.|$|E

25|$|In Valle de Etla, {{one group}} of {{indigenous}} residents has taken to collecting old tires found on the highway and have begun converting them into handcrafts. The craft idea began with Esteban Perada, originally from Santiago Suchilquitongo. Originally he used them to support washers and retaining walls and car bumpers. Getting creative, he {{found a way to}} convert a tire into a toucan design to hang flowerpots, painting it bright colors. Others liked it and requested the item for their gardens. Since <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> others have created other figures such as parrots, squirrels and more, selling enough to supplement family income.|$|E

25|$|On May 27, 1862, Hoyt enlisted as {{a private}} in the 87th Ohio Infantry. After one month of service he was made a {{commissary}} sergeant and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his regiment were captured by Confederate forces at the Battle of Harpers Ferry. Hoyt was mustered out on October 3, 1862 and he reenlisted as a commissary sergeant in the 2nd Ohio Heavy Artillery. Later commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 2nd Ohio Light Artillery and on January 15, 1866, was mustered out as the rank of captain. After the war {{he was a member}} of the Grand Army of the Republic.|$|E
25|$|While AVRO was {{a strong}} tournament and Flohr's last-placed finish was no disgrace, his result may also be {{explained}} by his difficult personal circumstances at the time. The German invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938 had left Flohr, as a Polish-Ukrainian Jew, in grave personal danger. Flohr remained in the Netherlands in early 1939, playing in several small events. He tied for first place in Amsterdam KNSB with Max Euwe and László Szabó at 3½/5. He tied third/fourth place in Amsterdam VARA with 3/5, as Euwe and Salo Landau won. He won Baarn I with 2½/3. <b>Then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his family fled, first to Sweden, and then to Moscow {{with the help of}} his friend Botvinnik. While in Sweden, he tied for first place at Gothenburg with Rudolf Spielmann with 10 points out of 11.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Chicago moved the ball 68 {{yards to the}} Cowboys 2-yard line. On third and 1, Harbaugh was stuffed for no gain by linebacker Jack Del Rio, and Neal Anderson was dropped by lineman Tony Tolbert on the next play. This {{experience}} would be repeated later when Chicago drove 77 yards to the 2-yard line again, with rookie Darren Lewis rushing four times for 37 yards and catching a pass for 11. On second and goal, Norton tackled Anderson at the 1, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Tolbert dropped Anderson for no gain on the next play. Rather than try another fourth down conversion, Chicago settled for Kevin Butler's 19-yard field goal to make the score 10-3 with 15 {{seconds left in the}} half.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fifth}} match, Hulk Hogan and Shawn Michaels faced Muhammad Hassan and Daivari. Hogan and Hassan began and Hassan was {{immediately}} sent into the turnbuckles. Hogan double clotheslined both his opponents and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Michaels {{teamed up with}} a big double boot to Hassan's face. Michaels {{climbed to the top}} rope but missed an elbow drop. Daivari was tossed outside where Hogan bashed him. Michaels hit Daivari with a flying forearm smash and a kip up. Michaels was about to hit Daivari with Sweet Chin Music, but instead Hassan hit Michaels with a lead pipe. Hassan then took advantage and locked Michaels in the Camel Clutch. Michaels fought his way to his feet and dropped Hassan with an Electric Chair. Hogan then got tagged in and went for a leg drop to Daivari, but Hassan hit Hogan with a lead pipe instead. As the referee has his back turned at Hogan, Michaels hit Daivari with Sweet Chin Music allowing Hogan to get the pinfall and win the match for his team.|$|E
25|$|One {{summer night}} in 1916, near Ploegsteert, Eden had {{to lead a}} small raid into an enemy trench to kill or capture enemy soldiers, so as to {{identify}} the enemy units opposite. He and his men were pinned down in No Man’s Land under enemy fire, his sergeant seriously wounded in the leg. Eden sent one man back to British lines to fetch another man and a stretcher, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> three others carried the wounded sergeant back with, as he later {{put it in his}} memoirs, a “chilly feeling down our spines”, unsure whether the Germans had not seen them in the dark or were chivalrously declining to fire. He omitted to mention that he had been awarded the Military Cross for the incident, something of which he had made little mention in his political career. On 18 September 1916, after the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (part of the Battle of the Somme), he wrote to his mother “I have seen things lately that I am not likely to forget”. On 3 October, he was appointed an adjutant, with the rank of temporary lieutenant for the duration of that appointment. At the age of 19, he was the youngest adjutant on the Western Front.|$|E
500|$|Isaac grew old {{and became}} blind. He called his son Esau and {{directed}} him to procure some venison for him, {{in order to}} receive Isaac's blessing. While Esau was hunting, Jacob, after listening to his mother's advice, deceived his blind father by misrepresenting himself as Esau and thereby obtained his father's blessing, such that Jacob became Isaac's primary heir and Esau was left in an inferior position. According to Genesis 25:29–34, Esau had previously sold his birthright to Jacob for [...] "bread and stew of lentils". Thereafter, Isaac sent Jacob into Mesopotamia to take a wife of his mother's brother's house. After 20 years working for his uncle Laban, Jacob returned home. He reconciled with his twin brother Esau, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Esau buried their father, Isaac, in Hebron after he {{died at the age of}} 180.|$|E

500|$|At the Battle of Tobruk, Savige's 17thInfantry Brigade {{was again}} split up {{and given a}} {{secondary}} role. However, in the advance on Derna, the brigade managed to beat Robertson's 19thInfantry Brigade to Giovanni Berta. By late February, the campaign was over and Savige was tasked with holding a defensive line near El Agheila. He became convinced that German troops were moving into the area, but his concerns were dismissed by the Brigadier General Staff at ICorps, Brigadier Sydney Rowell. A month later, Savige was proven right when the Afrika Korps pounced on the British forces around El Agheila, but by <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> the 17thInfantry Brigade were in Egypt, preparing for the Battle of Greece. Although the campaign had raised doubts about his suitability for command—mostly resulting from his performance at Bardia, but also {{with regard to the}} running feud with Vasey, Berryman and Robertson—Savige was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

500|$|On a {{hard and}} {{dangerous}} playing surface, Small Heath had {{much the better}} of the game against Northwich Victoria. The visitors scored first, which only served to settle the home side. The forwards dominated, {{the remainder of the}} first half being [...] "practically a bombardment of the Northwich goal". After Hallam used his pace to equalise, inside-left Wheldon was actively involved {{in the rest of the}} goals. Hallam just failed to reach the rebound from Wheldon's shot, and full-back Billy Ollis headed home from a Wheldon cross. The same player's shot across goal was tapped in by Walton, and a goal was awarded despite the Northwich goalkeeper's claim that the ball had not crossed the line. Wheldon himself scored the fourth with a [...] "brilliant shot", <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Hands ran the ball upfield before crossing for Hallam to score with a header. In the second half, Wheldon scored Small Heath's sixth from , before the pace of the game dropped and Northwich scored a consolation with a long-range cross-shot.|$|E
