50|$|Representatives of {{the order}} <b>Tubulidentata</b> have been located from the Oligocene {{in what is now}} Europe, and it is {{believed}} that the order probably originated around 65-70 million years ago or in the Paleocene. They are thought to be closely related to the now extinct Ptolemaiida, a lineage of carnivorous afrotheres. The family arose in Africa in the Early Miocene Epoch, and spread to Eurasia later in the Miocene. Most of the family's diversity had become extinct {{by the end of the}} Pliocene.|$|E
50|$|Among recent mammals, Paenungulata (hyraxes, elephants, and sea cows), Perissodactyla (horses, rhinoceroses, and tapirs), Artiodactyla (pigs, deer, antelope, cows, camels, hippos, {{and their}} relatives), Cetacea (whales), and <b>Tubulidentata</b> (aardvarks) are {{traditionally}} regarded {{as members of}} the Ungulata. Besides these, several extinct animals also belong to this group, especially the endemic South American orders of ungulates, (Meridiungulata). Although many ungulates have hoofs, this feature does not define the Ungulata. Indeed, some condylarths had small hoofs on their feet, but the most primitive forms are clawed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aardvark}} {{is sometimes}} colloquially called [...] "African ant bear", [...] "anteater" [...] (not {{to be confused}} with the South American anteater), or the [...] "Cape anteater" [...] after the Cape of Good Hope. The name [...] "aardvark" [...] (...) comes from earlier Afrikaans (erdvark) and means [...] "earth pig" [...] or [...] "ground pig" [...] (aarde: earth/ground, vark: pig), because of its burrowing habits (similar origin to the name groundhog). The name Orycteropus means burrowing foot, and the name afer refers to Africa. The name of the aardvarks's order, <b>Tubulidentata,</b> comes from the tubule-style teeth.|$|E

50|$|Simpson {{established}} the grouping {{on the basis}} of morphological criteria, but this traditional understanding of Ferungulata has been challenged by a more recent classification, relying upon genetic criteria. These studies separated his ungulate orders into two distinct placental groups, within Afrotheria and Laurasiatheria, respectively. The 'true' ungulates, Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla, along with the whales, are included in the revised group, along with the Carnivora, and with the addition of pangolins (Pholidota), but the <b>Tubulidentata</b> and paenungulates are excluded. To reflect this difference, the revised clade is usually referred to as Fereuungulata. The Fereuungulata is a sister group to the Chiroptera (bats) and together they make up Scrotifera.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the five}} orders, hyraxes {{are the most}} basal, {{followed}} by embrithopods; the remaining orders (sirenians, desmostylians and elephants) are more closely interrelated. These latter three are grouped as the Tethytheria, because {{it is believed that}} their common ancestors lived on the shores of the prehistoric Tethys Sea; however, recent myoglobin studies indicate that even Hyracoidea had an aquatic ancestor. Although morphological evidence continues to support the position of paenungulates with the ungulates, the molecular evidence suggests that Paenungulata is part of the cohort Afrotheria, an ancient assemblage of mainly African mammals of great diversity. The other members of this cohort are the orders Afrosoricida (tenrecs and golden moles), Macroscelidea (elephant shrews) and <b>Tubulidentata</b> (aardvarks).|$|E

5000|$|The {{aardvark}} is not {{closely related}} to the pig; rather, it is the sole extant representative of the obscure mammalian order <b>Tubulidentata,</b> in which it is usually considered to form one variable species of the genus Orycteropus, the sole surviving genus in the family Orycteropodidae. The aardvark is not {{closely related to}} the South American anteater, despite sharing some characteristics and a superficial resemblance. The similarities are based on convergent evolution. The closest living relatives of the aardvark are the elephant shrews, tenrecs and golden moles. Along with the sirenians, hyraxes, elephants, and their extinct relatives, these animals form the superorder Afrotheria. Studies of the brain have shown the similarities with Condylarthra, and given the clade's status as a wastebasket taxon it may mean some species traditionally classified as [...] "condylarths" [...] are actually stem-aardvarks.|$|E
5000|$|The greatly {{elongated}} head {{is set on}} a short, thick neck, {{and the end of}} {{the snout}} bears a disc, which houses the nostrils. It contains a thin but complete zygomatic arch. The head of the aardvark contains many unique and different features. One of the most distinctive characteristics of the <b>Tubulidentata</b> is their teeth. Instead of having a pulp cavity, each tooth has a cluster of thin, hexagonal, upright, parallel tubes of vasodentin (a modified form of dentine), with individual pulp canals, held together by cementum. The number of columns is dependent on the size of the tooth, with the largest having about 1,500. The teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously. The aardvark is born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw, which fall out and are not replaced. Adult aardvarks have only cheek teeth at the back of the jaw, and have a dental formula of: [...] These remaining teeth are peg-like and rootless and are of unique composition. The teeth consist of 14 upper and 12 lower jaw molars. The nasal area of the aardvark is another unique area, as it contains ten nasal conchae, more than any other placental mammal.|$|E

A {{total of}} 182 non-dental {{morphological}} characters from 100 species (79 extant, 21 extinct; 98 mammals and 2 non-mammals) was analyzed by two maximum parsimony tree building algorithms. Parallel analyses of 2, 258 pairwise immunodiffusion (IMDFN) comparisons with 16 chicken antisera on 101 mammalian species (representing 22 taxa) and of {{amino acid sequence}} data of alpha and beta hemoglobins and other published protein sequences were also conducted. Morphological and molecular results agree that Eutheria consists of five major clades and that rates of evolution are similar in the two approaches.

40|$|The <b>Tubulidentata</b> {{are unique}} among mammals {{for being the}} only order {{represented}} nowadays by a single living species, Orycteropus afer : the aardvark. Nevertheless, {{it is one of}} the least studied mammalian orders. Aardvarks are currently distributed all over sub-Saharan Africa, but the fossil record extends their spatial range to Europe and Asia. The earliest known <b>Tubulidentata</b> are ca. 20 million years old. About 14 species and three to four genera have been recognised so far, but since the late Pliocene, aardvarks have only been represented by a single genus and are restricted to Africa. The extant aardvark is the only species of <b>Tubulidentata</b> with a large distribution area, i. e. the African continent. There are three known Plio-Pleistocene African species of aardvark: Orycteropus afer (Pallas, 1766), O. crassidens MacInnes, 1956, and O. djourabensis Lehmann et al., 2004. Fossils of these species have been discovered in North-Africa, Kenya, and Chad respectively. The present study is focused on the aardvark material found in the Plio-Pleistocene of East Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya). New specimens from Asa Issie (Ethiopia) and East Turkana (Kenya) are described, and published ones are re-examined in the light of the latest discoveries. This study demonstrates that Kenyan specimens identified as O. crassidens are in fact representatives of the Chadian O. djourabensis. Moreover, additional material from Ethiopia and Kenya shows a close relationship with the latter species too. The presence of specimens of O. djourabensis in Chad and in Kenya during the Plio-Pleistocene implies that this taxon is the oldest-known species of aardvark to have experienced a continental dispersal. It also shows that Tubulidentates were able to cross Africa from east-west during Plio-Pleistocene times, despite the presence of the Rift Valley. It is however not possible to infer the centre of origin of O. djourabensis. Finally, this study suggests that two species of aardvark might have co-existed in Kenya during the early Pleistocene. doi: 10. 1002 /mmng. 200800003 </a...|$|E
40|$|An {{outstanding}} {{problem in}} mammal phylogeny {{is the relationship}} of the aardvark (Orycteropus afer), the only living species of the order <b>Tubulidentata,</b> to the extant eutherian lineages. In order to examine this problem the complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule of the aardvark was sequenced and analysed. The aardvark tRNA-Ser (UCN) differs from that of other mammalian mtDNAs reported and appears to have reversed to the ancestral secondary structure of non-mammalian vertebrates and mitochondrial tRNAs in general. Phylogenetic analysis of 12 concatenated protein-coding genes (3325 amino acids) included the aardvark and 15 additional eutherians, two marsupials and a monotreme. The most strongly supported tree identified the aardvark as a sister group of a clade including the armadillo (Xenarthra) and the Cetferungulata (carnivores, perissodactyls, artiodactyls and cetaceans).
