The water resistant qualities ascribed to the finish are probably why there are many toiletry cases and associated objects such as shaving kits, snuff boxes and other items of a personal nature. The restrained look of the skin was felt to be very suitable for men.|$|R

50|$|Although {{violent crime}} inside public toilets in {{relatively}} rare, {{it is not}} unheard of, particularly {{in areas where the}} violent crime rate in general is very high. In South Africa for instance, many people have reported being afraid to use public toilets. There have been several highly publicized murders in public toilets, such as the Seocho-dong public <b>toilet</b> murder <b>case.</b> In the US, an infamous case was the murder of a 9-years-old boy in 1998 in a San Diego county public toilet (the murderer was sentenced to death and committed suicide in 2011).|$|R

The police later refuted his claims and said the incident was not a hate crime against women, as claimed, but one driven by mental illness.|$|R
25|$|The {{environmental}} impact of modern style washlets differs from regular flush toilets. Modern toilets use less water than old toilets, and the self-cleaning options also {{reduce the amount of}} detergent. Some toilets even change the amount of water for the flush depending if the seat was flipped up (indicating male urination) or not. They also cause less toilet paper to be used. On the other hand, these toilets also consume energy, and are estimated to consume 5% of the energy of the average Japanese household. In rural areas, toilets that use very little or no water have also been designed. These are also considered as emergency <b>toilets</b> in <b>case</b> of earthquakes.|$|R

25|$|Sleepwalking Sleepwalking {{can lead}} to bedwetting. During sleepwalking, the sleepwalker may think he/she is in another room.

50|$|In natural {{disasters}} and other emergencies, the portability of bucket latrines {{can make them}} a useful part of an appropriate emergency response, especially where pit latrines cannot be isolated from floodwater or groundwater (potentially leading to groundwater pollution) and where the contents can be safely disposed into sanitary systems, taking measures to avoid contact with the contents. Different organizations give {{advice on how to}} build bucket <b>toilets</b> in <b>case</b> of emergency. The Twin Bucket Emergency Toilet system (a two bucket system), for example, has been developed in Christchurch, New Zealand following their infrastructure destroying earthquake in 2011. The system has been endorsed by the Portland Bureau of Emergency Management. It is promoted by the volunteer advocacy group PHLUSH (Public Hygiene Lets Us Stay Human) for reasons of safety, affordability and matching ecological sanitation principles.|$|R

50|$|Upon {{the first}} {{announcement}} of the program's format a debate arose about ethical acceptability. Could a program like this be decent and/or in good taste? It was not known whether participants would be shown showering or in the <b>toilet.</b> Though both <b>cases</b> had been deemed unacceptable, only the latter still holds. Experts argued whether participants should be protected against themselves and whether participation would cause psychological or emotional damage. This discussion included the moral panic in Sweden after the first contestant voted off Expedition Robinson killed himself, his family reportedly blaming the rejection he felt due to being unpopular with the public.|$|R

Pete tells Berg that, during sex, Melissa laughs uncontrollably in a psychotic manner. Berg says that Pete is overreacting {{and that he would}} be making a mistake if he broke up with her. Worrying that he might be late, Pete refuses to listen to Berg's advice. Berg then exclaims that Sharon will be down to drive him to class any minute.

5000|$|Son, never trust {{a man who}} doesn't drink because he's {{probably}} a self-righteous sort, a man who thinks he knows right from wrong all the time. Some of them are good men, but {{in the name of}} goodness, they cause most of the suffering in the world. They're the judges, the meddlers. And, son, never trust a man who drinks but refuses to get drunk. They're usually afraid of something deep down inside, either that they're a coward or a fool or mean and violent. You can't trust a man who's afraid of himself. But sometimes, son, you can trust a man who occasionally kneels before a toilet. The chances are that he is learning something about humility and his natural human foolishness, about how to survive himself.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{identify}} {{risk factors}} for transmission of verocytotoxin producing Escherichia coli O 157 (VTECO 157) and means of prevention.  STUDY DESIGN—Outbreak investigation: retrospective cohort study.  SETTING—A nursery (child care centre) in North Wales.  SUBJECTS—Children attending (n = 104).  METHODS—Faeces were examined using sorbitol MacConkey agar (SMAC), with cefixime, tellurite, and rhamnose; enrichment in modified tryptone soya broth; and immunomagnetic separation. Symptoms and exposure data were obtained from questionnaires to parents/guardians and children's toiletting and feeding records kept at the nursery.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE—A "case" {{was defined as a}} child with verocytotoxin producing E coli O 157 isolated from faeces, or a history of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) and antibodies to E coli O 157 lipopolysaccharide, during the period 10 August to 30 September 1995.  RESULTS—The attack rate was 31 in 104. Two children developed HUS. There were higher attack rates among girls and friends who played together. Cases were more likely to attend the nursery more frequently. The mean number of recorded bowel motions/child/half day was 0. 51 in cases and 0. 21 in well children. Child to staff ratios were high preceding and during the outbreak.  CONCLUSIONS—A sick child is the most plausible source of infection with subsequent person to person transmission. The record of children's <b>toiletting</b> discriminated between <b>cases</b> and well children and might have allowed earlier detection of the outbreak. This simple record could be considered by other child care facilities as a means of giving early warning of problems with infectious intestinal diseases. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND : The sentinal node biopsy (SNB) is a {{reliable}} method {{for determining the}} status of the regional lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer. SNB technology is evolving rapidly, but no standardization has yet been accomplished. The aim {{of this study is to}} discuss the accuracy of this procedure and the optimal method for identifying micrometastases. METHODS : We collected data from 70 women with primary invasive breast carcinoma who underwent SNB for breast cancer. We examined two frozen sections levels from each half of each lymph node, as well as a cytology imprint before arriving at the frozen section diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry with pancytokeratin (AE 1 /AE 3) was done on the paraffin sections. For the association between the lymph node size and the possibility of metastases, Student&#x 2032;s t test was used and a P value of less than 0. 05 was regarded as significant. RESULTS : The number of patients with metastases in SNB was 19, from which 15 cases were correctly diagnosed in frozen sections/imprints and four cases were false negative. The axillary <b>toilet</b> from all <b>cases</b> with SNB metastases smaller than 2 mm showed no additional positive nodes. Lymph node diameter showed a significant association with sentinel node status (P &# 60; 0. 0001). CONCLUSION : Frozen section examination of SNB from patients with breast carcinoma is both specific (100 &#x 0025;) and sensitive (79 &#x 0025;). Diagnosis of lobular carcinoma can be difficult, and may require immunohistochemistry with cytokeratin for diagnosis. Small metastases in a non-optimal frozen section may be difficult to discern. Cytology imprints add nothing to the diagnosis...|$|R

It 2 ̆ 7 s more than just Eva 2 ̆ 7 s story, which is {{interesting}} in itself; it 2 ̆ 7 s also my story, puny like a pinky. The story starts on a frigid February morning in 1992, when my friend Jack, a criminal defense lawyer with a solo-practice in downtown Chicago, called to talk with me about his sixteen-year-old client, Eva, who had hidden her pregnancy from her family and then given birth in a <b>toilet.</b> Her <b>case</b> was going to trial. He had never heard a story like hers. Oddly enough, I had. Criminal law is not subtle; it 2 ̆ 7 s efficient. All the state needed to prove in order for Eva to be guilty of murder was that she had committed a prohibited act, an actus reus, such as drowning her newborn baby, and that she did so purposely, or with mens rea. Legally, it didn 2 ̆ 7 t matter why Eva didn 2 ̆ 7 t tell anyone she was pregnant. She could be guilty even though she was ashamed she had had sex, believed abortion was murder, and was convinced her family would throw her out if they knew she was pregnant. It didn 2 ̆ 7 t matter that her boyfriend of two weeks had left her when she told him she 2 ̆ 7 d missed her period, or that Eva had cried for them to bring her the baby afterwards, when she lay in the emergency room. The jury convicted Eva, but not of murder, which would have meant decades behind bars. Instead, she got only involuntary manslaughter and probation. 2 ̆ 2 A victory for the defense, 2 ̆ 2 Jack said, 2 ̆ 2 as these things go. 2 ̆ 2 Her story ended without her ever really telling it. Meanwhile, three years after Eva 2 ̆ 7 s trial I had read everything I could find about mothers who kill their children, and still I didn 2 ̆ 7 t really understand what had happened to her. I asked Jack if he thought Eva might talk to me. Jack suggested we meet for lunch. Eva sat without moving, waiting for me to begin questioning her. In the background, there was a low buzz of conversation from customers in line. Cashiers called out order numbers as they slid plates along the stainless steel counter. There was an insistent pulse of tuneless music coming through the overhead speakers. Everything sounded distant and blurry, as if we were under water. I didn 2 ̆ 7 t have much of a plan, but we both had come to hear her story, so I began...|$|R
5000|$|Oak Lodge was {{established}} by the London County Council and opened on August 28, 1905 as a school for deaf girls aged 11-16. Many of the girls were boarders. It was sited in a beautiful old house on Nightingale Lane which used {{to belong to the}} curator of Kew Gardens. There were lots of old oak trees in the garden, so the school was called Oak Lodge. There was another school for Jewish deaf children next door, actually on the site where the school is now, which had started in 1899. There was no contact between the two schools for the first 50 years - there was a high wall separating them. All the staff at that first Oak Lodge were women and they were all hearing. They never used Sign Language. It is interesting to look at the old records and see what the girls were taught - they learned English, Art, some P.E., a little Maths, but lots of cookery, needlework and laundry - they were really being prepared to become servants and domestic workers. Many came from poor homes where they had not been well fed and illness was common. The school thought that an important part of its job was to give the girls plenty of fresh air and better food to help them become stronger. There were about 50 girls in the school.At the start of the Second World War in 1939 it was decided that the school must be evacuated. All the pupils and staff moved to a camp near Bognor. In 1940 there were bombs near the camp so they decided they would have to move again, this time to Northampton. It must have been a very difficult time - looking at the old school records for one month in 1940, there were over 100 alarms because of bombs. At the end of the war, in 1945, everyone returned to London, but first they had to repair the Oak Lodge building because 2 bombs had hit the school during the war.In 1955 Oak Lodge became a day school. There was another school for deaf boys in Anerley, near Crystal Palace. This closed in 1957 and the boys transferred to Oak Lodge, so from that time it was a day school for about 60 boys and girls. There was still no Sign Language used by the staff. If anyone was naughty they were hit with the cane. The punishment book from those days makes for interesting reading. One entry from 1948 says: [...] "rudeness and impudence - 2 strokes [...] ".In 1965 the Jewish school closed and then in 1968 both schools were demolished and the present building - the new Oak Lodge - was built. There were 40 pupils, boys and girls, and the hostel started for children to sleep there Monday to Friday each week. There were just 6 full-time teachers with 3 part-time teachers of art, mime and music. It is interesting to read that the whole school cost just £241,000 to build, and all the furniture and equipment cost only £23,000. There was still very little signing in the school though the children signed amongst themselves. There were no deaf teachers. In the new Oak Lodge, for the first time, deaf children started to take and pass real exams - that had not happened before. The school became very successful. 1977 was the Queen's Silver Jubilee Year. Two schools in all of London were chosen for her to visit as part of the celebration, one of which was Oak Lodge. Preparations went on for months - rooms and corridors were painted, new tarmac in the playground, and they even built a new <b>toilet</b> in <b>case</b> the Queen wanted to use it during her visit! However, she retained her queenly waters and only stayed in the school for 40 minutes, meeting children and staff and signing the visitors' book. The Head Boy had just finished work experience at the factory where the Queen's handbags are made and he talked to her about that.The Headteacher from 1986 to 2009 was Peter Merrifield. In 1991 Wandsworth's Hearing-Impaired Service {{was established}}; In 1992 - the first 16 Plus students started at the school; in 1995 - the 16 Plus Centre opened; in 1996 the charity [...] "Aim HI" [...] was established.|$|R
40|$|Energy {{and waste}} {{management}} and water supply are possible means {{of increasing the}} quality of life in development countries. One of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG, defined by the UN in September 2000) is to halve, by 2015, the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation (under MDG 7 Ensure environmental sustainability). Although access to energy is not explicitly included in the MDG list, it surely may enable to reach some of these goals, such as: •	MDG 1 Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, trough the development of small economic activities to supply energy services to the population; •	MDG 2 Achieve universal primary education: supplying energy to primary and secondary schools the access to education and communication will be extended; •	MDG 3 Promote gender equality and empower women: the reduction of wood consumption will increase women quality of life, leaving them enough time to develop their economic activities; •	MDG 4 Reduce Child Mortality Rate and MDG 5 Improve maternal health, reducing the exposure to indoor pollutants produced during the wood combustion in poorly efficient stoves; •	MDG 7 : Ensure environmental sustainability, reducing the deforestation. In this paper we present two different case studies were organic waste management, access to clean water and energy were faced: water supply and sanitation in Ghana; sanitation and energy supply in northern Tanzania. The water supply and sanitation sector in Ghana faces severe problems even if the sector has been gradually modernized through the creation of an autonomous regulatory agency, introduction of private sector participation, and decentralization of the rural supply. The water supply and sanitation infrastructure is insufficient, especially in rural areas and concerning sanitation, with a very poor control oh hygienic aspects. The proposal regards toilet facilities building and wastewater depuration system. The proposed solution can contribute to face the problem of water supply and sanitation and can be easily adopted and results interesting also under the economic point of view. Best Ray - Bringing Energy Service to Tanzania Rural Area is an European Commission funded project (2008 - 2011) that aims at providing energy services to poor un-served rural communities living in Arumeru District, Northern Tanzania, through appropriate and renewable technologies. A particular attention was focused on biogas technologies, trough the participation to the Tanzanian Domestic Biogas Programme. Domestic biogas plants convert animal manure and human excrement at household level into small, but valuable, amounts of combustible methane gas that can be used in simple gas stoves for cooking or in lamps for lighting. Farmers may use biogas especially in remote rural areas where the electric grid is still not present or would be too costly to be developed. Given the success history of TDBP, the Best Ray project team explored the possibility to install three bigger biogas plants to supply energy for the kitchens of three secondary schools. Biogas plants can be connected directly to the <b>toilets.</b> In this <b>case</b> Biogas production from toilet can fulfill between 9 a 19...|$|R
