25|$|The {{following}} is {{a complete list of}} titles made available during the <b>test</b> <b>market</b> campaign in Boston and Seattle. These are the only titles that were part of the <b>test</b> <b>market</b> campaign. Many other DualDisc releases were issued in subsequent years, following the completion of the <b>test</b> <b>market,</b> but these were not part of the original set of releases. The <b>test</b> <b>market</b> version of any title on this list should be considered scarce or rare. Two of these 15 titles were issued after the <b>test</b> <b>market</b> had begun; these late addition titles are those by Fischerspooner and Jane's Addiction. The remaining 13 titles were available {{from the start of the}} test marketing campaign.|$|E

5000|$|The simple go or no-go decision, {{together}} with the related reduction of risk, is normally the main justification for the expense of <b>test</b> <b>markets.</b> At the same time, however, such <b>test</b> <b>markets</b> {{can be used to}} test specific elements of a new product's marketing mix; possibly the version of the product itself, the promotional message and media spend, the distribution channels and the price. In this case, several `matched' <b>test</b> <b>markets</b> (usually small ones) may be used, each <b>testing</b> different <b>marketing</b> mixes. Clearly, all <b>test</b> <b>markets</b> provide additional information in advance of a launch and may ensure that launch is successful: it is reported that, even at such a late stage, half the products entering <b>test</b> <b>markets</b> do not justify a subsequent national launch. However, all <b>test</b> <b>markets</b> do suffer from a number of disadvantages: ...|$|R
40|$|Selection of "matched" {{areas for}} <b>test</b> <b>marketing</b> is an {{important}} undertaking if reliable comparisons among markets are to be made. This usually {{has been done on}} a rather arbitrary basis, largely because of the large number of market characteristics on which markets can be viewed as similar or different. The authors suggest a numerical procedure [...] cluster analysis [...] for matching prospective <b>test</b> <b>markets</b> {{on the basis of a}} large variety of characteristics which could affect <b>test</b> <b>marketing</b> results. In this way, markets can be pre-selected so as to reduce undesired variability among test areas. ...|$|R

25|$|Oatmeal {{was added}} to the breakfast menu on December 27, 2010, after it test-marketed well in Washington, D.C. and some parts of Maryland. In the <b>test</b> <b>market</b> areas, oatmeal started selling in late January 2010.|$|E
25|$|The DualDisc {{version was}} later reissued {{in a more}} widely {{distributed}} version. The original <b>test</b> <b>market</b> version differs from this common version in both packaging elements and {{in the design of}} the back of the inlay card.|$|E
25|$|The titles by Fischerspooner and Jane's Addiction were {{released}} {{during the test}} marketing phase, but {{were not in the}} initial shipments. They shipped to the select <b>test</b> <b>market</b> retailers after the test began. Three additional titles were announced as being part of the test, but were never issued: Barbra Streisand: The Movie Album (82796-90789-2-1), Missy Elliott: This is Not a Test (0-7559-62934-2-6) and Sheryl Crow: The Globe Sessions (02498-61433-4).|$|E

25|$|When {{dealing with}} {{promotion}} a marketing manager must {{account for all}} the market complexities {{that are involved in}} a decision. As it is difficult to account for all aspects of the market, a manager should look to incorporate both experienced judgements from senior executives as well modifying these judgements in light of economically justifiable information gathering. An example of the application of Bayesian decision theory for promotional purposes could be the use of a test sample in order to assess the effectiveness of a promotion prior to a full scale rollout. By combining prior subjective data about the occurrence of possible events with experimental empirical evidence gained through a <b>test</b> <b>market,</b> the resultant data {{can be used to make}} decisions under risk.|$|E
25|$|On September 8, 2008, at 12 noon, WWAY, WECT, WSFX, WILM-LP and W51CW {{all turned}} off their analog signals, making Wilmington the first {{market in the}} nation to go digital-only as part of a test by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to iron out {{transition}} and reception concerns before the nationwide shutoff. Wilmington was chosen as the <b>test</b> <b>market</b> because the area's digital channel positions will remain unchanged after the transition. As the area's official conduit of emergency information, WUNJ did not participate in the early analog switchoff, and kept their analog signal on until the national digital switchover date of June 12, 2009. W47CK did not participate due to its low-power status; FCC rules currently exempt low-powered stations from the 2009 analog shutdown. WILM-LP and W51CW chose to participate, even though they are exempt as LPTV stations.|$|E
25|$|Below {{is a list}} of the 15 DualDisc titles {{released}} as part of a test marketing campaign that was run before DualDiscs were released nationwide. These releases were only available in two test markets: Boston and Seattle, and only at a handful of stores in each market (15 stores in the Boston area, 12 in the Seattle area). The test marketing campaign started on February 3, 2004. It is believed that fewer than 1000 copies of any title were sold during the test marketing, making them all scarce and now collectible. One title, Dave Brubeck's Time Out, was recalled shortly after the start of the <b>test</b> <b>market</b> campaign due to a rights lawsuit. As a result, very few copies of this title were ever sold. It is estimated that fewer than 50 copies of this title are known to exist, {{making it one of the}} rarest commercially released CDs of all time.|$|E

50|$|The sauce was <b>test</b> <b>marketed</b> by Rich Davis, {{who was a}} child psychiatrist, in 1977 in Kansas City, Missouri as K.C. Soul Style Barbecue Sauce. The sauce, which {{originally}} {{started with}} only five ingredients, sold more than 3,000 cases. Davis renamed it KC Masterpiece. During this same time, he also <b>test</b> <b>marketed</b> Muschup (a combination of ketchup and mustard) and Dilled Muschup.|$|R

25|$|Sales were {{encouraging}} {{throughout the}} holiday season, though sources vary {{on how many}} consoles were sold then. In 1986, Nintendo said it sold nearly 90,000 units in nine weeks during its 1985 New York City test run. Nintendo added Los Angeles as a <b>test</b> <b>market</b> in February 1986, followed by Chicago and San Francisco, then other top 12 US markets, and nationwide sales in September. It and Sega, which was similarly exporting its Master System to the US, planned to spend $15 million {{in the fourth quarter}} of 1986 to market their consoles; later, Nintendo said it planned to spend $16 million and Sega said more than $9 million. Nintendo obtained a distribution deal with toy company Worlds of Wonder, which leveraged its popular Teddy Ruxpin and Lazer Tag products to solicit more stores to carry the console. The largest retailer Sears sold it through its Christmas catalog and the second largest retailer Kmart sold it in 700 stores. Nintendo sold 1.1 million consoles in 1986, estimating that it could have sold 1.4 million if inventory had held out. Nintendo earned $310 million in sales, out of total 1986 video game industry sales of $430 million, compared to total 1985 industry sales of $100 million.|$|E
2500|$|A new package may be {{evaluated}} in a <b>test</b> <b>market</b> that uses people {{to try the}} packages at home. [...] Consumers {{have the opportunity to}} buy a product, perhaps with a coupon or discount. [...] Return postcards or Internet sites provide feedback to package developers. [...] Perhaps the most critical feedback is repeated sales items in the new package. Packaging evaluations {{are an important part of}} marketing research.|$|E
2500|$|All {{of these}} DualDisc titles are {{now out of}} print. Some were reissued as {{standard}} commercial issue DualDiscs once the test marketing phase was over, but in every case this was done with packaging changes (although not necessarily changes to the UPC). For example, the <b>test</b> <b>market</b> version of AC/DC's Back in Black {{does not have a}} large [...] "FBI warning" [...] logo on the back, whereas the standard reissue does.|$|E

2500|$|When {{testing the}} EMH one inevitably finds either 1) that [...] {{the market is}} inefficient, or 2) that the asset pricing model used to <b>test</b> <b>market</b> {{efficiency}} is incorrect. Hence tests of market efficiency run into this joint hypothesis problem. For instance, early tests of market efficiency used the CAPM, which could be an incomplete model of asset prices; test results on market efficiency would thus be inconclusive.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in November 2005, Staples began a test called [...] "Heavy Up" [...] {{primarily}} using {{stores in}} New York state {{to experiment with}} {{the expansion of the}} offerings by the Staples Tech Center. A subsequent test known as [...] "Double Up" [...] was planned for an unspecified <b>test</b> <b>market</b> and was scheduled to begin the first half of 2006. The tests ran to promote competition with Best Buy's Geek Squad and Circuit City's Fire dog.|$|E
2500|$|Despite a {{nationwide}} advertising campaign and intense media attention, OK Soda was marketed only in select areas, representing different demographic areas {{during the summer}} of 1993. Four separate can designs were used (with each <b>test</b> <b>market</b> getting all four designs). [...] Coke announced at the time that they would continually update the cans with new designs (later designs can be identified by having an explanatory tag saying that it is [...] "A unique fruity soda").

2500|$|Farm Sanctuary {{prompted}} Burger King franchise owner David Kessler {{to bring}} a veggie burger to customers in western New York in 1993. Mr. Kessler said that getting corporate approval for his request to <b>test</b> <b>market</b> the Griller [...] "was like turning the [...] around in a bathtub", {{but that he was}} able to prove that the veggie burger was very popular. [...] In March 2002, Burger King announced it was adding a veggie burger nationwide to its permanent menu, with Morningstar Farms as its sole supplier.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, a Rebel Raider [...] two-door hardtop {{was sold}} only in New York and New Jersey. The {{marketing}} of these cars was timed {{to coincide with}} the New York City Auto Show. Three hundred Raiders were built and many were part of a “driveaway” by area dealers {{on the eve of the}} Auto Show. All Raiders came with a V8 engine with automatic transmission, as well as “blow-your mind colors to choose from: electric green, tangerine, and blue-you’ve never seen.” This was a <b>test</b> <b>market</b> of the “Big Bad” colors by AMC through a regional dealer-lead promotional campaign. The bright hues were later introduced at mid-year on the Javelin and AMX models. Other standard features on the Raider included black upholstery and carpeting, black front grille, black vinyl roof, a sports-type steering wheel, AM radio, power steering, and power brakes. The total price of the special Raider models was advertised at US$2,699.|$|E
2500|$|In 2016, Cleese reprised {{his role}} as Basil {{in a series of}} TV adverts for High Street {{optician}} chain Specsavers. The same year, Cleese and Booth reunited to create and co-write the official theatrical adaptation of Fawlty Towers, which premiered in Melbourne at the Comedy Theatre. It was critically well received, subsequently embarking on a successful tour of Australia. Cleese was intimately involved {{in the creation of the}} stage version from the beginning, including in the casting. He visited Australia to promote the adaptation, as well as oversee its success. Melbourne was chosen to premiere the adaptation due to Fawlty Towers' [...] enduring popularity in Australia, and also because it has become a popular international <b>test</b> <b>market</b> for large-scale theatrical productions in recent years, having recently been the city where the revised Love Never Dies and the new King Kong were also premiered. Cleese also noted he did not believe the London press would give the adaptation fair, unbiased reviews, so he deliberately choose to premier it elsewhere.|$|E
