500|$|A second Solid Steel album called Foley Room Recorded Live in Brussels was {{recorded}} in Brussels at the Ancienne Belgique in 2007 and was released for free in November 2008. According to Tobin's official website, [...] "After months of {{back and forth and}} despite everyone's best efforts the mix was in danger of being edited into the ground to accommodate big labels and publishers. Rather than release a compromised version commercially, the decision was made <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> for free instead." ...|$|E
500|$|Whereas {{the first}} song {{was a little bit}} more artistic and a little bit more soulful, and it has done everything, it {{probably}} exceeded my expectations, I mean, from the moment I was able <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> I was able to kind of be reintroduced in a way musically, and thank you to [...] Diplo, but 'Scream' is really like the next step. It's just in time for summer and the type of experience that I want people {{to get out of the}} album.|$|E
500|$|Grant wrote [...] "Buck Rogers" [...] with The Pixies as an influence, but [...] "on a {{comic book}} level". He had {{originally}} written the track for another band Echo Park producer Gil Norton was working with, but decided not <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> as he felt Feeder could have a hit with it themselves. [...] "Buck Rogers" [...] still receives regular airplay on alternative radio stations in the United Kingdom. Kerrang!'s writers have also approved of the track {{as one of their}} [...] "666 Songs You Must Own", when it appeared at #5 in their rock songs list in November 2004.|$|E
6000|$|... "Less of the thieves. This {{is just a}} {{straight}} business proposition. I've got something valuable to sell, and I'm darned if I'm going <b>to</b> keep <b>giving</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> I've been too easy. I ought to have thought of this before. All right, then, that's settled. Now it's up to you. You can think {{out the rest of}} it yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No game at all," [...] {{returned}} Brooks coolly. [...] "You {{came here}} to sell a secret. I don't propose <b>to</b> have <b>it</b> <b>given</b> <b>away</b> first <b>to</b> any listener." ...|$|R
25|$|It {{was around}} this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by {{merchandising}} offers and, underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose <b>to</b> effectively <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> Seltaeb was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles merchandising rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrneâ€™s favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which eventually cost NEMS an estimated $100 million in licensing fees.|$|R
500|$|... "Lisa's Pony" [...] is {{the eighth}} {{episode in the}} third season of the American {{animated}} television series The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 7, 1991. In this episode, Homer goes drinking at Moe's Tavern instead of buying a new reed for Lisa's saxophone, resulting in her flopping at the school talent show. Desperate to win back his daughter's love, Homer gives Lisa the one thing she has always wanted: a pony. Homer struggles with two jobs {{to cover the cost}} of sheltering and feeding the pony. Lisa, upon seeing what Homer must go through to pay for the pony, decides <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
500|$|Lopez {{arrived on}} the red carpet of the 42nd Grammy Awards in the company of then-boyfriend Sean Combs; he was dressed in a gray suit. Although the fashion house Versace had only loaned the dress, it {{subsequently}} decided <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> as a token of gratitude for the enormous publicity generated. The singer immediately monopolized the attention and curiosity of the public and photographers at the event. Actor David Duchovny appeared on stage with Lopez to present the award for Best R Album and declared to the audience, [...] "This {{is the first time in}} five or six years that I'm sure that nobody is looking at me", eliciting laughter from the audience and Lopez.|$|E
500|$|However, {{according}} to the authorized biography Prism of the Night, by Katherine Ramsland, Rice's father {{was the source of}} his daughter's birth name: [...] "Thinking back to the days when his own name had been associated with girls, and perhaps in an effort <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> Howard named the little girl Howard Allen Frances O'Brien." [...] Rice became [...] "Anne" [...] on her first day of school, when a nun asked her what her name was. She told the nun [...] "Anne," [...] which she considered a pretty name. Her mother, who was with her, let it go without correcting her, knowing how self-conscious her daughter was of her real name. From that day on, everyone she knew addressed her as [...] "Anne", and her name was legally changed in 1947. Rice was confirmed in the Catholic Church when she was twelve years old and took the full name Howard Allen Frances Alphonsus Liguori O'Brien, adding the names of a saint and of an aunt, who was a nun. [...] "I was honored to have my aunt's name," [...] she said, [...] "but it was my burden and joy as a child to have strange names." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 {{established}} {{the concept of}} fee simple ownership, by which ownership was in perpetuity with unlimited power <b>to</b> sell or <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> This was called the [...] "first guarantee of freedom of contract in the United States." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Papa, {{you know}} it is a shame. After all your hopes, all your {{expectations}} to get back to your old house, <b>to</b> see <b>it</b> <b>given</b> <b>away</b> in this way to a perfect stranger!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Gaites {{nodded in}} proud assent, and Birkwall went on: [...] "I {{thought you were}} faking the name last night; but I didn't want <b>to</b> <b>give</b> you <b>away.</b> <b>It</b> was the real thing, wasn't it, after all." ...|$|R
500|$|Other reviews {{were not}} as positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. [...] The two criticized the idea that Scully would give her child up for {{adoption}} solely based on the word of Jeffrey Spender, noting [...] "if she wasn't going <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> {{for the sake of}} its own protection after a UFO cult abducted it , then why should she because Jeffrey Spender of all people comes along and informs her that it's under threat?" [...] Shearman and Pearson, however, did praise Chris Owens' acting, writing that he did a [...] "great job". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, wrote a largely negative review of the episode and derided its plot. He heavily criticized the idea that Scully would offer William up for adoption. Kessenich did however praise Duchovny's directing, noting that [...] " [...] did a masterful job of luring me back to this world of The X-Files". Aaron Kinney from Salon wrote that the episode [...] "scuttled the entire" [...] baby William subplot. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, praised the decision to conclude the William subplot but called the episode's conclusion [...] "sappy".|$|E
2500|$|In June 2014, the ABW {{conducted}} {{a raid on}} editorial office of [...] "Wprost" [...] newspaper, after [...] "Wprost" [...] published stenographic records of private conversations between country officials implicating them in many unconstitutional acts and bribery. The ABW used physical force on newspapers editor-in-chief Sylwester Latkowski {{in an attempt to}} illegally seize his laptop computer, after he refused <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> without court warrant.|$|E
2500|$|Menotti wrote Amahl {{with the}} stage in mind, {{even though it was}} {{intended}} for broadcast. [...] "On television you're lucky if they ever repeat anything. Writing an opera is a big effort and <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> for one performance is stupid." [...] The composer appeared on-screen in the premiere to introduce the opera and give the background of the events leading up to its composition. He also brought out director Kirk Browning and conductor Thomas Schippers to thank them on-screen.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning with [...] "Man of the World"'s melancholy lyric, Green's bandmates {{began to}} notice changes {{in his state of}} mind. He was taking large doses of LSD, grew a beard and began to wear robes and a crucifix. Mick Fleetwood recalls Green {{becoming}} concerned about wealth: [...] "I had conversations with Peter Green around that time and he was obsessive about us not making money, wanting us <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> all <b>away.</b> And I'd say, 'Well you can do it, I don't wanna do that, and that doesn't make me a bad person.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|Walden's ex-wife {{describes}} him as [...] "having {{the emotional}} maturity of a 12-year-old", and she, his housekeeper Berta and his ex-girlfriend Zoey have all {{described him as}} needy. However, he drives a Fisker Karma as he cares about the environment, and {{does not believe in}} lending money, as it is never repaid and leads to resentment of the person to whom the money is lent; instead he prefers <b>to</b> just <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> He does not like the taste of alcohol and so does not drink much. Kutcher described him as [...] "somewhere between an alien and Jesus Christ".|$|R
30|$|The other spout has a {{receiving}} tippy bucket (corresponding to {{the accumulation}} of magnetic energy) which tips when it is full or the spring attached <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>away.</b> <b>It</b> is this impulsive flipped flow (energy) {{which is responsible for}} the expansion phase and causes the expansion phase of auroral substorms for about 1 Â h; the current driven by the tippy bucket produces the unloading (UL) current in the ionosphere, which is a single-cell current system (Fig.Â  5) [Akasofu et al. 1965]; it will be shown later the limit of amount of water (energy) is about 2 [*]Ã—[*] 1022 Â ergs. At the peak of the expansion phase, the UL current can exceed the DD current (see Fig.Â  9), indicating that the energy for the expansion phase is not just an enhancement of the Sâ€“M dynamo power and thus once stored before expansion onset. Thus, the growth phase is not caused by a system delay (Akasofu, 2013; p. 7222 [18]) and thus is the loading period.|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean," [...] said Harry hastily, [...] "that youâ€™ve got sich {{a generous}} nature that when youâ€™ve â€™ad a glass or two youâ€™re {{just as likely}} as not <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> to somebody." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would not}} be doing justice to the lad, neither. He won the garment, and had a right <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> The most you may think, Mabel, is to believe that, had I won it, it {{would have gone to}} the same person." ...|$|E

60|$|He kept it six months, {{and then}} {{returned}} <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me. I <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> twice after that, but it wouldn't stay; it came back. Then I <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> our coachman, Patrick McAleer, who was very grateful, {{because he did not}} know the animal, and thought I was trying to make him wiser and better. As soon as he got wiser and better he traded it to a heretic for a side-saddle which he could not use, and there my knowledge of its history ends.|$|R
5000|$|In the Chula Vista Handicap on September 1, Bayakoa battled {{for almost}} the entire race with Fantastic Look, to whom she was conceding 14 pounds. In mid-stretch Bayakoa looked beaten but she then rallied, winning by a nose in the final stride. [...] "That was a tough one," [...] said McAnally. [...] "I don't think she's ever had to run harder than that. That was {{an awful lot of}} weight <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>away.</b> <b>It's</b> a lot <b>to</b> ask; even a horse like her.|$|R
2500|$|Proby {{travelled}} to London {{after being}} introduced to Jack Good by Sheeley and Jackie DeShannon. [...] He appeared on The Beatles' television special in 1964. Under Good, Proby had UK top 20 hits in 1964 and 1965 including [...] "Hold Me" [...] (UK No.3), [...] "Together" [...] (UK No.8, featuring guitarists Big Jim Sullivan and Jimmy Page), [...] "Somewhere" [...] (UK No.6), and [...] "Maria" [...] (UK No.8); the latter two songs were both lifted from the musical West Side Story. He also recorded the Lennonâ€“McCartney composition [...] "That Means a Lot", a song The Beatles attempted <b>to</b> record before <b>giving</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b>|$|R

60|$|They made {{signs to}} the natives for some food, {{and they went}} and fetched several herbs and roots, and some milk; but it was evident they did not design <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> but to sell it, making signs to know what our men would give them.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Edward, {{who was on}} duty at the time, sniffed disagreeably, but {{she said}} nothing. The dress was of no value in her eyes, for the pattern was so ugly and old-fashioned that none of her smart daughters would have worn it. Had it been otherwise, Aunt Caroline would {{probably}} not have been allowed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{two most}} famous philanthropists of the Gilded Age pioneered {{the sort of}} {{large-scale}} private philanthropy of which foundations are a modern pillar: John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie. The businessmen each accumulated private wealth at a scale previously unknown outside of royalty, and each in their later years decided <b>to</b> <b>give</b> much of <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> Carnegie <b>gave</b> away {{the bulk of his}} fortune in the form of one-time gifts to build libraries and museums before divesting almost the entirety of his remaining fortune in the Carnegie Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation of New York. Rockefeller followed suit (notably building the University of Chicago) and gave nearly half of his fortune to create the Rockefeller Foundation.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2010, {{while working}} as a {{bartender}} at the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C., Jones recorded a collection of songs he titled The Little Fox. That June, he traveled to SXSW in Austin, Texas, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> copies of <b>it</b> <b>away</b> [...] and shop it around to record labels. He was approached by Thirty Tigers with a distribution deal, but still needed a record label. [...] This prompted Jonesâ€™ manager at the time and 9:30 Club co-owner Seth Hurwitz, who felt strongly about Jonesâ€™ music after hearing Jones play at an opening at an art gallery in D.C., to start 9:30 Records to put out Jonesâ€™ releases. [...] The Little Fox EP was released that year through 9:30 Records to favorable reviews.|$|R
25|$|Rick Porcello pitched seven innings, {{struck out}} seven, and was aided by 13 runs as he cruised to his twentieth win {{of the season}} in the Friday opener, the first 20-game winner for the Red Sox since Josh Beckett in 2007. The hot bats did not carry over to game two and Boston lost another one-run game. Eduardo RodrÃ­guez went six innings and allowed three runs, two earned, on four hits. Game three saw {{eighteen}} pitchers used by both teams. The respective starters did not make it through the fourth inning, each allowing six runs. Toronto put a five-spot on the board in the third inning, to take a two-run lead, only <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> right <b>away</b> in the fourth and reclaiming it {{in the bottom of the}} inning. Hanley RamÃ­rez made it a one-run game in the fifth on a solo shot and with runners on first and second in the sixth, John Gibbons summoned JoaquÃ­n Benoit from the bullpen to face David Ortiz, the same pitcher he hit a grand slam off in game two of the 2013 ALCS, which was the turning point of the series. Ortiz hammered the second pitch into the right field stands to put the Red Sox up for good in this game. He passed Jimmie Foxx in the all-time home run list with 535.|$|R

5000|$|In early February 2010, the Israeli-based {{humanitarian}} organization, IsraAid, {{opened a}} child education {{center in the}} PÃ©tion-Ville tent city, {{in conjunction with other}} agencies, such as Operation Blessing. The center was set up initially in the tents from the IDFâ€™s field hospital. The [...] "Muncheez" [...] pizza restaurant was turned into a community soup kitchen. It served approximately 1,000 free meals a day. Before the quake, the restaurant chain was a place where few even in PÃ©tion-Ville could afford to eat. After the quake, owners realized that the food stored at the three restaurants would spoil before it would get back into business and decided <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> all <b>away.</b> Although still living in the streets, the cooks still came to cook for the masses. Owners distributed blue bracelets throughout PÃ©tion-Ville, one bracelet for one meal. They selected one of the outlets to become the soup kitchen and moved all 105 employees to that site to cook. When food ran out after two days, the HÃ´tel Montana donated what could be salvaged from their freezers. When they began running out of fuel, cooking oil and food, a convoy from relatives of the owners in the Dominican Republic arrived, funded by donations with more food and fuel. USAID supplied fuel, cooking oil and food to cook, and World Vision supplied bulgur and lentils.|$|R
40|$|A {{small set}} of game makers in Australia are placing {{creative}} expression over financial gain, writes Daniel Golding {{in the final}} instalment of a three-part series on the videogame industry. Why do Australians make videogames? In recent articles, I've looked at who makes games in Australia, {{and what kinds of}} games it is that they're making. When it comes to the next logical issue-why make games at all?-some of the question has been tacitly explored in these previous two articles. We can already talk about why, for example, the structures of big and small Australian studios have been created to make videogames. Certainly, there's a lot of compelling work being done in this area of the industry-and even a cursory glance at the small fleet of independent designers at the gargantuan PAX videogames expo held in Melbourne this last weekend reveals a lot of confident, creative work being done in this vein locally. However, what I'm interested in here, by means of concluding this semi-formal trilogy of articles, is the margins of videogame making in Australia. As long as many Australians still pay $ 100 for a videogame in a box from a store, the videogame will remain a commercial object deeply ingrained in the money-making cycle. So why would anyone make a videogame if they're going <b>to</b> just <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> for free? What else could be going on for Australians to want to dedicate their lives to this medium...|$|R
60|$|The {{letter is}} {{accompanied}} by two photographs of the young lady. I should have cried myself had I seen her as she was at first. She was a stumpy, flat-headed, squat-nosed, cross-eyed thing. She did not even look good. One virtue she appears to have had, however. It was faith. She believed what the label said, she did what the label told her. She is now a tall, ravishing young person, her only trouble being, I should say, {{to know what to}} do with her hair--it reaches to her knees and must be a nuisance to her. She would do better <b>to</b> <b>give</b> some of <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> Taking this young lady as a text, it means that the girl who declines to be a dream of loveliness does so out of obstinacy. What the raw material may be does not appear to matter. Provided no feature is absolutely missing, the result is one and the same.|$|R
