5|$|It is, as an Upanishad, {{a part of}} {{the corpus}} of Vedanta {{literature}} that presents the philosophical concepts of Hinduism. The Varaha Upanishad emphasizes that liberation from sorrow and fear requires a human being to know the non-dualistic nature of existence, oneness between Self, Brahman and Vishnu, and the role of Yoga in self-liberation, and lists ten Yamas (virtues) as essential to a liberation of one's soul: nonviolence, satya, asteya, brahmacharya, compassion, rectitude, kshama, non-hypocrisy, mitahara, and shaucha. The text describes the Jivanmukta as one whose inner state, amongst other things, is neither affected by happiness nor by suffering inflicted on him, who does not shrink out of fear from the world, nor the world shrinks from him with fear, and whose sense of calm and inner contentment is free from anger, fear, and joy <b>toward</b> <b>others.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{tendency}} towards reciprocity {{implies that}} people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them. This {{has been used by}} charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity. Another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation. The tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful <b>toward</b> <b>others</b> in general after being helped. On the other hand, people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating. People sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to, or their helping may not be noticed, which may cause unintended conflicts. As such, it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of non-cooperation.|$|E
25|$|Another primary {{advantage}} to imagination is that, {{though it is}} contextualized by physical elements and time, it is not entirely subject to them, therefore enabling the kind of creativity they need to imagine possibilities not readily visible in their physical world and further weigh alternatives. Put otherwise, imagination provides “the means for navigating between our experiences in conversations and practices, and the theories we develop about our selves, our lives, and our world.” Through discourse, it also enables people to envision the experiences of others in their minds and by so doing invoke a deeper understanding and empathy <b>toward</b> <b>others.</b> Martin and Sugarman write {{that this kind of}} empathic envisioning is instrumental to therapeutically conceptualizing and understanding the clients with which therapists work.|$|E
25|$|Prayer {{is fairly}} {{prevalent}} in the United States. About 75% of the United States reports praying {{at least once a}} week. However, the practice of prayer is more prevalent and practiced more consistently among Americans who perform other religious practices. There are four primary types of prayer in the West. Poloma and Pendleton, utilized factor analysis to delineate these four types of prayer: meditative (more spiritual, silent thinking), ritualistic (reciting), petitionary (making requests to God), and colloquial (general conversing with God). Further scientific study of prayer using factor analysis has revealed three dimensions of prayer. Ladd and Spilka’s first factor was awareness of self, inward reaching. Their second and third factors were upward reaching (toward God) and outward reaching (<b>toward</b> <b>others).</b> This study appears to support the contemporary model of prayer as connection (whether to the self, higher being, or others).|$|E

25|$|The moral {{influence}} {{doctrine of}} atonement is typically taught within a paradigm of salvation {{which focuses on}} positive moral change as the core of Christianity. God is depicted as concerned with whether a person's inner character is good or evil (where 'good' refers primarily to unselfish love <b>toward</b> <b>others).</b> In this system, God works to bring positive moral change within the hearts of individuals and to transform societies to become more loving. He acted to bring such change through {{the teachings of the}} Old Testament Law, the Jewish Prophets, and the teaching and example of Jesus. The inspiring power of Jesus' martyrdom and subsequent resurrection are also often cited as catalysts for moral change. Many holding a moral influence view also believe that the Holy Spirit works to help people toward moral change. In the moral influence view, it is generally believed that God will judge the souls of the dead in the afterlife based on their moral character, attested to by their conduct (a belief that many Evangelical Protestants reject). Most advocates of the view strongly endorse the concept of Free Will, insisting that humans are responsible for their actions and capable of change. However, some advocates (e.g. Augustine) have held the view that humans are incapable of moral change themselves and require God to radically alter their psychology through the Holy Spirit's working in them. The moral influence model of atonement is usually associated with a minimal doctrine of Original Sin or complete denial thereof, although not always (again Augustine is a notable exception).|$|E

500|$|Townsend had {{asserted}} {{in chapter}} {{one that the}} cause of China's present misery lies in the fundamental defects that exist in the ethnic characteristics of the Chinese people and in chapters three and four he explains what he believes these defects are. Townsend states that dishonesty is [...] "the most prominent characteristic in the Chinese mentality as opposed to our own". Townsend gives many examples of him being lied to by Chinese employees, coolies, shopkeepers, and government officials, and notes that many other consuls were driven out of the service by this relentless and [...] "aimless lying, with each lie merely a pretext for another". The other highly salient trait of the Chinese is their [...] "indifference to fellow suffering". Through a large number of personal and second-hand anecdotes, Townsend argues that the Chinese may be the only {{people in the world who}} are completely unable to comprehend the basic human impulses of sympathy or gratitude toward other people. Because the Chinese feel no empathy <b>toward</b> <b>others,</b> they behave in an unbelievably sadistic and cruel fashion toward one another, and they view altruistic foreigners as targets to be mercilessly taken advantage of. Other traits Townsend identifies as being typically Chinese are cowardice, [...] lust for money, lack of a sense of personal hygiene, lack of critical thinking skills, insincerity, and obsession with hollow rites. Townsend believes that these traits are as notable among China's leaders and educated strata as much as they are in the poor masses, and his analysis of historical documents leads him to believe that they are not a recent product of the present chaos, but rather are deeply ingrained traits of China's national character. He concludes that the [...] "outstanding characteristics" [...] of the Chinese people [...] "neither enable other peoples to deal satisfactorily with them, nor enable the Chinese to deal satisfactorily with themselves." ...|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "hostile {{attribution}} bias" [...] {{was first}} coined in 1980 by Nasby, Hayden, and DePaulo who noticed, {{along with several}} other key pioneers in this research area (e.g., Kenneth Dodge), that a subgroup of children tend to attribute hostile intent to ambiguous social situations more often than other children. Since then, hostile attribution bias has been conceptualized as a bias of social information processing (similar to other attribution biases), including the way individuals perceive, interpret, and select responses to situations. While occasional hostile attribution bias is normative (particularly for younger children), {{researchers have found that}} individuals who exhibit consistent and high levels of hostile attribution bias across development {{are much more likely to}} engage in aggressive behavior (e.g., hitting/fighting, reacting violently, verbal or relational aggression) <b>toward</b> <b>others.</b>|$|E
