Fundamental {{problems}} in California???s civil service processes result in increased costs and places California at risk to address future workforce needs given the {{increased number of}} retiring state employees. This study examines various reports issued over a fifteen year period by the Little Hoover Commission, the Legislative Analyst's Office, California Bureau of State Audits, and the California Performance Review, {{to gain a better}} understanding of the challenges that surround civil service practices in California. This study also explored reform trends in other states to determine how other governmental entities resolved similar challenges. Using the challenges framed in this thesis, I reassessed California???s current civil service practices to determine if <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>addressed</b> the initial challenges identified. The results of my study found the civil service practices of classification, recruitment and selection, workforce planning, and employee performance management to be the greatest challenges to improving inefficient and ineffective processes. Specifically, the governance structure of the State Personnel Board and the Department of Personnel Administration, and the relationship between labor and management in California hinder efforts to improve the civil service. This study suggests several approaches to addressing civil service challenges through the restructuring the governance of statewide human resource functions, adopting a collaborative approach for labor-management negotiations around classifications and employee performance, expanding testing methods, establishing mandated workforce plans, and ensuring leadership development.

40|$|This Final Report on the Monitoring Phase of {{the former}} Weeks Island Strategic Petroleum Reserve crude oil storage {{facility}} details the results of five years of monitoring of various surface accessible quantities at the decommissioned facility. The Weeks Island mine was authorized by the State of Louisiana as a Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil storage facility from 1979 until decommissioning of the facility in 1999. Discovery of a sinkhole over the facility in 1992 with freshwater inflow to the facility threatened {{the integrity of the}} oil storage and led to the decision to remove the oil, fill the chambers with brine, and decommission the facility. Thereafter, a monitoring phase, by agreement between the Department of Energy and <b>the</b> <b>State,</b> <b>addressed</b> facility stability and environmental concerns. Monitoring of the surface ground water and the brine of the underground chambers from the East Fill Hole produced no evidence of hydrocarbon contamination, which suggests that any unrecovered oil remaining in the underground chambers has been contained. Ever diminishing progression of the initial major sinkhole, and a subsequent minor sinkhole, with time was verification of the response of sinkholes to filling of the facility with brine. Brine filling of the facility ostensively eliminates any further growth or new formation from freshwater inflow. Continued monitoring of sinkhole response, together with continued surface surveillance for environmental problems, confirmed the intended results of brine pressurization. Surface subsidence measurements over the mine continued throughout the monitoring phase. And finally, the outward flow of brine was monitored as a measure of the creep closure of the mine chambers. Results of each of these monitoring activities are presented, with their correlation toward assuring the stability and environmental security of the decommissioned facility. The results suggest that the decommissioning was successful and no contamination of the surface environment by crude oil has been found...|$|E
