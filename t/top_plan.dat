Funding for the STEM school is included in the Tennessee Race to the <b>Top</b> <b>plan.</b> $2 million was provided to the school through the Race to the Top funding. The idea for the L&N STEM Academy began with the district’s strategic plan from 2009 that aimed for a “high quality, stand-alone technology high school.” While applying for the Race to the Top funding, two plans for the L&N STEM Academy were merged; plans for a school to focus on science, math, and engineering and a plan for a STEM platform school were merged. To receive the funding from Race to the Top, the school had to meet the following requirements: “enrollment has to be open for any students who show the motivation to study in that environment and sharpen their skills, the school must be willing to try new things and officials must share with their neighbors their successes and failures.”In January 2011, Becky Ashe was appointed principal of the school and also the coordinator of STEM education for Knox County Schools. At the same time, the L&N station was officially chosen as the site for the school.|$|E

A pervasive challenge is that many teacher preparation programs operate in isolation, removed from the realities of working in today's schools.

Information automation is responsible for the collection, processing, analysis, and presentation of information to the flightcrew.

Air transport pilots interacted with an example information automation system in ways that allowed investigation of the information automation characteristics of automation visibility and information quality. The evaluation found that poor information quality appeared to be difficult for participants to detect, even when they were presented with the highest automation visibility level.

40|$|Steel storage racks, made of cold-formed steel, {{are used}} {{extensively}} in industry for storing goods. Two main racking systems prevail, {{referred to as}} "selective" and "drive-in" racks. International racking design codes mainly deal with selective racks, while limited design guidelines are available for drive-in racks. Drive-in racks require minimum floor space by storing pallets {{one after the other}} with no space between them. The forklift truck drives into the rack to store the pallets on the first-in, last-out principle. To allow forklift passage, drive-in racks can only be braced at the back (spine bracing) and at the <b>top</b> (<b>plan</b> bracing) in the down-aisle direction resulting in a complex slender structure with poorly understood 3 D behavior and increased risk of collapse. As yet, tests on drive-in rack systems to accurately capture their 3 D behavior are not available in the literature.

Next-generation air transportation system operational concepts will dramatically affect the types and amount of information available on flight decks. Information automation systems collect, process, and present information to support pilot tasks and awareness. The definition of flight deck information automation was refined to differentiate it from other types of automation. Pilots interacted with an example information automation system to investigate the premise that automation visibility {{will have an impact}} on the ability of pilots to detect problems resulting from poor information quality. Poor information quality appeared to be difficult for pilots to detect, even when presented with high automation visibility.

40|$|Three pilot-scale, horizontal-flow biofilm {{reactors}} (HFBRs 1 - 3) {{were used}} to treat methane (CH 4) -contaminated air to assess the potential of this technology to manage emissions from agricultural activities, waste and wastewater treatment facilities, and landfills. The study was conducted over two phases (Phase 1, lasting 90 days and Phase 2, lasting 45 days). The reactors were operated at 10 degrees C (typical of ambient air and wastewater temperatures in northern Europe), and were simultaneously dosed with CH 4 -contaminated air and a synthetic wastewater (SWW). The influent loading rates to the reactors were 8. 6 g CH 4 /m 3 /hr (4. 3 g CH 4 /m 2 TPSA/hr; where TPSA is <b>top</b> <b>plan</b> surface area). Despite the low operating temperatures, an overall average removal of 4. 63 g CH 4 /m 3 /day was observed during Phase 2. The maximum removal efficiency (RE) for the trial was 88 %. Potential (maximum) rates of methane oxidation were measured and indicated that biofilm samples taken from various regions in the HFBRs had mostly equal CH 4 removal potential. In situ activity rates were dependent on which part of the reactor samples were obtained. The results indicate {{the potential of the}} HFBR, a simple and robust technology, to biologically treat CH 4 emissions. Implications: The results {{of this study indicate that}} the HFBR technology could be effectively applied to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from wastewater treatment plants and agricultural facilities at lower temperatures common to northern Europe. This could reduce the carbon footprint of waste treatment and agricultural livestock facilities. Activity tests indicate that methanotrophic communities can be supported at these temperatures. Furthermore, these data can lead to improved reactor design and optimization by allowing conditions to be engineered to allow for improved removal rates, particularly at lower temperatures. The technology is simple to construct and operate, and with some optimization of the liquid phase to improve mass transfer, the HFBR represents a viable, cost-effective solution for these emissions...|$|E
