500|$|Fonville's son, Carl Eric Fonville, {{later wrote}} {{that his father}} was troubled by the unequal {{treatment}} given to African-American athletes during the Kansas meet at which he set the world record. Upon arriving at the Kansas Relays, Fonville and Harrison Dillard of Baldwin-Wallace College were housed at the home of a black family. His son wrote: [...] "Without unpacking they decided to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the University of Kansas campus where they found the other visiting white athletes being given campus tours and their treatment far different than their own. They both considered leaving but decided to stay and compete. Charles called Ann Arbor, Michigan to tell them that he wanted leave, he got Don Canham who told him that he was 'Sent to Kansas City to represent the University of Michigan,' the conversation was short and clear." [...] Fonville and Dillard both set new world records at the event.|$|E

6000|$|Meanwhile {{his wife}} and Edith wandered along the rocks picking up shells and pebbles; and the men dispersed, some to smoke and chat, others to search for eggs. Bryan and La Roche, who were both {{aspiring}} geniuses, and had formed a sort of rough attachment to each other, asked permission to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the point ahead, where they would wait for the canoes.

I'm glad, yes, I'm glad Godfrey knocked him down, though I suppose {{there will be a}} scandal. Well, my hands are clean; I have done my duty, and I must not {{complain}} if it is unpleasant, since I have dragged Godfrey back {{from the mouth of the}} pit.

60|$|In {{the morning}} the lads {{inspected}} {{the vicinity of the}} fire once more, and spent some time in shooting off a pistol and a shotgun which Roger possessed. Then, acting on a suggestion from Dave, they <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the railroad station.|$|R
60|$|The {{messenger}} {{came back}} with the information that Mrs. Petherwin had <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the Close, her companion alone remaining at the hotel.

He had not walked far when he saw Ethelberta moving slowly along the High Street before him.|$|R
60|$|My {{talk with}} the Stranger came about in this wise. One evening I had <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> Victoria Park--a {{favourite}} haunt of mine at summer time. It was a fair and peaceful evening, and I fell a-wandering there in pleasant reverie, until the waning light hinted to me the question of time. I looked about me. Only one human being was in sight, a man with his back towards me, seated upon a bench overlooking the ornamental water.|$|R
60|$|The party {{returned}} from the fishing excursion about eight o'clock; but as it was still {{half an hour before}} sunset, Mr. George proposed to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> one of the castles. The waiter at the hotel had told them that he could give them a ticket, and then the porter at the castle would let them in at the gate, and allow them to walk about the grounds and around the castle, but they could not go into it, for the proprietor and his family were residing there.|$|E
60|$|The {{whole of}} that {{afternoon}} he spent playing lawn-tennis with Miss Boncassen. Lady Mabel {{was asked to}} join the party, but she refused, having promised to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> a distant waterfall where the Codlem falls into the Archay. A gentleman in knickerbockers was to have gone with her, and two other young ladies; but {{when the time came}} she was weary, she said,--and she sat almost the entire afternoon looking at the game from a distance. Silverbridge played well, but not so well as the pretty American. With them were joined two others somewhat inferior, so that Silverbridge and Miss Boncassen were on different sides. They played game after game, and Miss Boncassen's side always won.|$|E
6000|$|Tom excepted, Martin Poyser {{had some}} {{pride in his}} {{servants}} and labourers, thinking with satisfaction {{that they were the}} best worth their pay of any set on the estate. There was Kester Bale, for example (Beale, probably, if the truth were known, but he was called Bale, and was not conscious of any claim to a fifth letter), the old man with the close leather cap and the network of wrinkles on his sun-browned face. Was there any man in Loamshire who knew better the [...] "natur" [...] of all farming work? He was one of those invaluable labourers who can not only turn their hand to everything, but excel in everything they turn their hand to. It is true Kester's knees were much bent outward by this time, and he walked with a perpetual curtsy, as if he were among the most reverent of men. And so he was; but I am obliged to admit that the object of his reverence was his own skill, towards which he performed some rather affecting acts of worship. He always thatched the ricks--for if anything were his forte more than another, it was thatching--and when the last touch had been put to the last beehive rick, Kester, whose home lay at some distance from the farm, would <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the rick-yard in his best clothes on a Sunday morning and stand in the lane, at a due distance, to contemplate his own thatching walking about to get each rick from the proper point of view. As he curtsied along, with his eyes upturned to the straw knobs imitative of golden globes at the summits of the beehive ricks, which indeed were gold of the best sort, you might have imagined him to be engaged in some pagan act of adoration. Kester was an old bachelor and reputed to have stockings full of coin, concerning which his master cracked a joke with him every pay-night: not a new unseasoned joke, but a good old one, that had been tried many times before and had worn well. [...] "Th' young measter's a merry mon," [...] Kester frequently remarked; for having begun his career by frightening away the crows under the last Martin Poyser but one, he could never cease to account the reigning Martin a young master. I am not ashamed of commemorating old Kester. You and I are indebted to the hard hands of such men--hands that have long ago mingled with the soil they tilled so faithfully, thriftily making the best they could of the earth's fruits, and receiving the smallest share as their own wages.|$|E

60|$|Some {{six hundred}} years after Christianity sprang {{up in the}} East and swept westwards, another great faith arose in almost the same eastern lands and {{followed}} it like its gigantic shadow. Like a shadow, it was at once a copy and a contrary. We call it Islam, or the creed of the Moslems; and perhaps its most explanatory description {{is that it was}} the final flaming up of the accumulated Orientalisms, perhaps of the accumulated Hebraisms, gradually rejected as the Church grew more European, or as Christianity turned into Christendom. Its highest motive was a hatred of idols, and in its view Incarnation was itself an idolatry. The two things it persecuted were the idea of God being made flesh and of His being afterwards made wood or stone. A study of the questions smouldering in the track of the prairie fire of the Christian conversion favours the suggestion that this fanaticism against art or mythology was at once a development and a reaction from that conversion, a sort of minority report of the Hebraists. In this sense Islam was something like a Christian heresy. The early heresies had been full of mad reversals and evasions of the Incarnation, rescuing their Jesus from the reality of his body even {{at the expense of the}} sincerity of his soul. And the Greek Iconoclasts had poured into Italy, breaking the popular statues and denouncing the idolatry of the Pope, until routed, in a style sufficiently symbolic, by the sword of the father of Charlemagne. It was all these disappointed negations that took fire from the genius of Mahomet, and launched out of the burning lands a cavalry charge that nearly conquered the world. And if it be suggested that a note on such Oriental origins is rather remote from a history of England, the answer is that this book may, alas! contain many digressions, but that this is not a digression. It is quite peculiarly necessary to keep in mind that this Semite god haunted Christianity like a ghost; to remember it in every European corner, but especially in our corner. If any one doubts the necessity, let him <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> all the parish churches in England within a radius of thirty miles, and ask why this stone virgin is headless or that coloured glass is gone. He will soon learn that it was lately, and in his own lanes and homesteads, that the ecstasy of the deserts returned, and his bleak northern island was filled with the fury of the Iconoclasts.|$|E

The site is marked at Walcha a mosaic made with the ideas and help of the local Dhungutti community. Apsley Falls are in the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park, just off the Oxley Highway, 20 km south of Walcha.
