5|$|A {{reusable}} Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) {{launch vehicle}} was {{planned to be}} implemented about 15 years after the addition of LFBBs to Ariane 5. However, only a preliminary analysis of TSTO was completed. The proposed configuration consisted of two boosters with retractable wings attached to the external fuel tank, and a reusable orbiter with fixed wings carrying payload on top of it. During geostationary <b>transfer</b> <b>orbit</b> (GTO) missions, an additional, expandable upper stage would be used.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, 2014, Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), {{launched}} by the Indian Space Research Organisation, reached Mars orbit. ISRO launched MOM on November 5, 2013, {{with the aim of}} analyzing the Martian atmosphere and topography. The Mars Orbiter Mission used a Hohmann <b>transfer</b> <b>orbit</b> to escape Earth's gravitational influence and catapult into a nine-month-long voyage to Mars. The mission is the first successful Asian interplanetary mission.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{element of}} the STS-8 mission payload was INSAT-1B. It was the second {{in a series of}} {{multi-purpose}} weather and communications satellites to be operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); the first, INSAT-1A, had been launched by a Delta rocket in April 1982, but had to be shut down shortly afterwards due to a failure of the onboard reaction control system. The satellite was carried {{in the rear of the}} shuttle's payload bay, and was boosted into a geosynchronous <b>transfer</b> <b>orbit</b> by a Payload Assist Module (PAM-D), a small solid rocket upper stage, after its release from the orbiter.

25|$|Hohmann {{transfer}} orbit: An orbit {{that moves}} a spacecraft from one approximately circular orbit, usually {{the orbit of}} a planet, to another, using two engine impulses. The perihelion of the <b>transfer</b> <b>orbit</b> {{is at the same}} distance from the Sun as the radius of one planet's orbit, and the aphelion is at the other. The two rocket burns change the spacecraft's path from one circular orbit to the <b>transfer</b> <b>orbit,</b> and later to the other circular orbit. This maneuver was named after Walter Hohmann.|$|E

50|$|<b>Transfer</b> <b>orbits</b> {{are usually}} {{elliptical}} orbits that allow spacecraft {{to move from}} one (usually substantially circular) orbit to another. Usually they require a burn at the start, a burn at the end, and sometimes one or more burns in the middle.|$|R

25|$|Using low thrust engines (such as {{electrical}} propulsion), if {{the initial}} orbit is supersynchronous {{to the final}} desired circular orbit then the optimal <b>transfer</b> <b>orbit</b> is achieved by thrusting continuously {{in the direction of}} the velocity at apogee.

25|$|The {{space agency}} had planned the launch on 28 October 2013 but was {{postponed}} to 5 November following {{the delay in}} ISRO's spacecraft tracking ships to take up pre-determined positions due to poor weather in the Pacific Ocean.

50|$|Like the Hohmann <b>{{transfer}},</b> both <b>transfer</b> <b>orbits</b> {{used in the}} bi-elliptic transfer constitute {{exactly one}} half of an elliptic orbit.

50|$|All three {{satellites}} {{were successfully}} deployed, {{one at a}} time, and their booster stages fired automatically to lift them to geosynchronous <b>transfer</b> <b>orbits.</b> Their respective owners assumed charge, and later fired the onboard kickmotors at apogee, to circularize the orbits and align them with the equator.|$|R

25|$|The Japanese {{government}} made both companies share the 110°E position, and thus both made a joint order on November 1998 for N-SAT-110 from Lockheed Martin. It was also called JCSAT-7 by JCSAT, and Superbird-5 by SCC. On December 2, an Ariane-44P successfully orbited JCSAT-5, which became JCSAT-1B. JSAT-6 was rechristened as JCSAT-4A after successfully being injected in its <b>transfer</b> <b>orbit</b> by an Atlas IIAS on February 16, 1999.|$|E
