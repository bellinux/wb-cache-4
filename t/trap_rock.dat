25|$|The {{topography}} of present-day Science Hill was primarily formed during the Wisconsinan glaciation. The Laurentide ice sheet flattened the soft sandstone of New Haven Harbor but had less effect on its surrounding, hard <b>trap</b> <b>rock</b> formations like East Rock and West Rock.

25|$|Mount Holyoke, {{like much}} of the Metacomet Ridge, is {{composed}} of basalt, also called <b>trap</b> <b>rock,</b> a volcanic rock. The mountain formed {{near the end of}} the Triassic Period with the rifting apart of the North American continent from Africa and Eurasia. Lava welled up from the rift and solidified into sheets of strata hundreds of feet thick. Subsequent faulting and earthquake activity tilted the strata, creating the dramatic cliffs and ridges of Mount Holyoke. Hot, dry upper slopes, cool, moist ravines, and mineral-rich ledges of basalt talus produce a combination of microclimate ecosystems on the mountain that support plant and animal species uncommon in greater Massachusetts. (The Metacomet Ridge article has more information on the geology and ecosystem of Mount Holyoke).|$|E

The Siberian traps, which occupy an area of more than 1, 500, 000 km^ 2, are best developed there.

25|$|Talcott Mountain hosts a {{combination}} of microclimates unusual in New England. Dry, hot upper ridges support oak savannas, often dominated by chestnut oak {{and a variety of}} understory grasses and ferns. Eastern red cedar, a dry-loving species, clings to the barren edges of cliffs. Cooler east-facing backslopes tend to support extensive stands of eastern hemlock interspersed with the oak-hickory forest species more common in the surrounding lowlands. Narrow ravines crowded with hemlock block sunlight, creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in eastern Connecticut. Because the <b>trap</b> <b>rock</b> ridges generate such varied terrain, they are the home of several plant and animal species that are state-listed or globally rare.|$|E

In most but not all cases, the basalt layers are dominant, prevalent, and exposed. Although only [...] above sea level at its highest, with an average summit elevation of , the Metacomet Ridge rises dramatically from much lower valley elevations, making it a prominent landscape feature.|$|E
500|$|Located in {{then both}} Union Hill and New Durham, the Reformed Church at New Durham {{which was also}} known as the [...] "Grove Church", was for many years the only Methodist church in the area. It has been {{operational}} since April 12, 1843, {{and was one of the}} first religious bodies established in the wilds of North Hudson, the Bergen Woods. The first pastor was Reverend Philip Duryee who acted until 1844, and was succeeded by William Taylor, a Rutgers graduate who later acted as pastor for a nearby Jersey City congregation. Taylor was succeeded by William Mabon in 1846. The land at the cemetery has been used for burial purposes since 1847, which has made it one of the oldest burial grounds in Hudson County. Typical grave depths are approximately five feet, and the grounds bare dry soils of yellowish earth, loose drift gravel, and pockets of sand, as well as occurrences of <b>trap</b> <b>rock.</b> Before the turn of the 20th century, there were two vaults on the premises, one made of brick and the other of stone; there are many more now. Overall, the grounds at Grove Church Cemetery are roughly [...] Because of the natural descent of the cemeteries location on the western side of the Palisades, ground water flows into the surrounding marshes in Secaucus, and contamination of wells, springs, and water-courses in the surrounding area is very low. Other than having a relatively large congregation, many of the church members were of wealth, and owned plots and vaults in the cemetery.|$|E

Finally the action of the atmosphere removed the Deccan traps in parts exposing Gondwana and Laments beds. During the last stage also alluvial soil, the common black cotton soil, was spread over parts of the District.|$|R

From south to north, the trail uses the ridges of the Hanging Hills, Short Mountain, Ragged Mountain, Bradley Mountain, Pinnacle Rock, Rattlesnake Mountain, Farmington Mountain, Talcott Mountain, Hatchet Hill, Peak Mountain, and West Suffield Mountain. Abrupt vertical cliffs with visible talus slopes and frequent viewpoints are common throughout. Views are generally to the west from West Suffield Mountain south through Ragged Mountain; with views in all directions at varying points in the Hanging Hills. The Farmington River cuts through the ridgeline between Hatchet Hill and Talcott Mountain in the Tariffville Gorge (east of Simsbury).
