25|$|Another notable female {{smuggler}} was Hannah Seller, {{one time}} landlady of the Ship in Distress, {{who has a}} channel in the harbour named after her (Mother Sillar's Channel). This channel, now silted up, used to lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> pub and thus was a convenient 'trade' route. Next door to the pub was a tobacco and snuff factory, owned by the by then 'respectable' John Streeter who had earlier been gaoled {{for his part in}} the Battle of Mudeford. Perhaps not unsurprisingly, many of the deliveries came at night and other local tobacco traders complained that they were unable to compete with Streeter.|$|E
2500|$|At {{approximately}} 9:20 PM, October 5, 1980, an unclothed {{white female}} between 13 and 25 years old (most likely younger than 19) {{was found with}} blunt force trauma <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head (believed to be from a hammer), signs of injury to the face and stab wounds {{on her head and}} back. She was found near Arroyo Grande Boulevard, close to state highway 146, where interstate 215 is now. She had been placed in a [...] "posed" [...] position and was face-down. The body was discovered by two men driving on a dirt road, one of whom was an off-duty police officer. Examiners determined that the blade of the weapon, believed to be an ice pick, that was used to stab the victim was around three inches long. The body appeared to have been washed and fragments of a shower curtain were nearby.|$|E
2500|$|Polly Moore, born November 10, 1928, {{graduated}} {{high school}} in 1945 in Atlanta, Texas, {{at the age of}} 16 and had worked for the Red River Arsenal (now Red River Army Depot) as a checker since July of that year. The seventeen-year-old was living with her cousin, Mrs. Ardella Campbell, in a boardinghouse at 1215 Magnolia St (demolished during widening of State Line Avenue). She had been dating Griffin for six weeks {{at the time of her}} death. Friends described her as being [...] "homey", as she did not go out with boys much. She was last seen with Griffin on Saturday at 2 p.m. at a W 7th street café, and later around 10 p.m. at another café on W 7th street, having dinner with Griffin's sister and her boyfriend. Her body was found fully clothed, sprawled face down across the back seat of Griffin's car, with a gunshot wound <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head. A picture of her at her former home in Douglassville, Texas, with her arm wrapped around a black and white dog, was found in her purse, beside her on the seat; it was printed in the next morning's newspaper. She was also wearing her class ring, with the inscription [...] "P.A.M. -- '45", which allowed police to identify the body.|$|E

5000|$|The subjunctive in Modern English {{occurs in}} a variety of {{contexts}} usually relating to desire or conditional actions. Regardless of the subject, the form of the present subjunctive verb that expresses present or past desires (and other uses) in that clauses is the bare form of the infinitive (not preceded by [...] "to"). Hence, the present subjunctive of [...] "to go" [...] is [...] "I go", [...] "you go", [...] "he/she/it go", [...] "we go", [...] "they go". For instance: [...] "It was required that he go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line" [...] (compared with the past indicative [...] "Everyone knows that he went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line"); and [...] "It is required that he go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line" [...] (compared with the present indicative [...] "Everyone knows that he goes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line").|$|R

60|$|The {{first person}} that came was a pretty-looking peasant girl of about seventeen, {{who had a}} tub upon her head. What was in the tub Rollo could not see. With such a burden on her head, however, it is plain that the girl could not wear her hat in the {{ordinary}} manner, and so she carried it tied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck, with its broad brim covering her shoulders. This, Mr. Holiday said, seemed to him to be carrying the modern fashion of wearing the bonnet quite to an extreme.|$|E
