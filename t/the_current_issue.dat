25|$|Meanwhile, on February 24, the Amyotha Hluttaw (the Upper House) invited {{six major}} groups of {{stakeholders}} - the NNER, the ACDE, some 20 political parties, relevant {{members of the}} public, civil society groups and individuals who submitted the suggestions to the parliament - on <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>issue</b> to attend public hearings between March 5 – 15. Later that day, the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee (SSMNC) – a body of government-appointed monks in charge of regulating Buddhist monks in Burma – issued {{a statement to the}} parliament publicly accusing that the proposed amendment bill that recognized unions will result in confusion between religious and political issues, leading to the demise of the roots of Theravada Buddhism]]. Arkar Moe Thu, a member of NNER, however, pointed out that according to Article 68(a), “schools that only teach religion are not governed by the law”. Meanwhile, the students confirmed that they would continue marching on March 1, accusing the parliament for intentionally delaying the process of passing the amendment bill.|$|E
25|$|The TAIC {{released}} its interim {{report on the}} accident on 10 May 2012. Examination of the wreckage showed electrical arcing on the basket {{and one of the}} four propane cylinders, consistent with a power line strike. Details about the maintenance and record-keeping of the balloon were released. The most recent inspection had occurred on 14 September 2011, with several errors made in the records and inspection. The inspection report erroneously recorded the type certificate as B2GL, which is applicable to Cameron Balloons United States for serial numbers 5000 and higher – ZK-XXF was manufactured in the United Kingdom and was serial number 4300, so the correct type certificate was BB12. It also recorded the basket and burners as being of Cameron Balloons, not as being of Thunder and Colt. Anomalies were also identified in the maintenance logbook, including incorrect identification of the basket and burners, no record of four airworthiness directives, and no entry regarding the use of the gas bottles. The maintenance provider was also found to be using outdated versions of the Flight and Maintenance Manuals, using the 1992-released Issue 7 rather than <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>Issue</b> 10, and that the maintainers had tested the strength of the envelope by hand, rather than the prescribed method of using a spring gauge to measure actual strength.|$|E

2500|$|The Egyptian government, {{along with}} those of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates, broke off {{diplomatic}} relations with Qatar on 5 June 2017. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry announced it was closing its air and sea ports to Qatari transportation. The Egyptian, Saudi, Bahraini, and Emirati governments cited Qatar's continuing support for [...] "terrorism", such as the Muslim Brotherhood. Islam Hassan argues [...] "Egypt has had troubled relations with Qatar for many years, except of Mohamed MorsiÕsperiod in power. The Egyptian government has seen Qatar as a source of instability. TheEgyptian regime also sees that Qatar challenges its rule by financing the Muslim Brotherhood, and other organizations, which the regime has outlawed and consider terrorist organizations. Thus, the Egyptian regime has been trying to push back on Qatar by any means. <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>issue</b> between the Saudi bloc and Qatar seemed to be an opportunity to put pressure on Qatar to stop financing the Muslim Brotherhood, its affiliates, and supporters, and to support the Sisi regime." ...|$|E

6000|$|Now {{for that}} great {{multitude}} of prosperous people {{who find themselves}} at once deeply concerned in our present social and economic crisis, and either helplessly entangled in party organisation or helplessly outside politics, the elimination and cure of this disease of statecraft, the professional politician, has become a very urgent matter. To destroy him, {{to get him back}} to his law courts and keep him there, it is necessary to destroy the machinery of the party system that sustains him, and to adopt some electoral method that will no longer put the independent representative man at a hopeless disadvantage against the party nominee. Such a method {{is to be found in}} proportional representation with large constituencies, and to that we must look for our ultimate liberation from our present masters, these politician barristers. But the Labour situation cannot wait for this millennial release, and for <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>issue</b> it seems to me patent that every reasonable prosperous man will, even at the cost to himself of some trouble and hard thinking, do his best to keep as much of this great and acute controversy as he possibly can out of the lawyer's and mere politician's hands and in his own. Leave Labour to the lawyers, and we shall go very deeply into trouble indeed before this business is over. They will score their points, they will achieve remarkable agreements full of the possibility of subsequent surprises, they will make reputations, and do everything Heaven and their professional training have made them to do, and they will exasperate and exasperate! ...|$|E
