40|$|This report {{investigates the}} {{potential}} for the culture of G. gracilis, an indigenous red alga, into the west coast mariculture farm Jacobs Bay Sea Products Pty. Various methods for cultivating Gracilaria as well as environmental parameters, which influence growth of Gracilaria, are disltussed below. From these optimal conditions for the polycultivation of G. gracilis are determined. Cultivation can take place either, in open waters, or on land. Open water systems are generally less intensive than land based operations. Open water systems can be either bottom planted or suspended. Suspended cultivation has the advantage of maintaining the plant thalli in optimal light intensities. Land based systems can make use of ponds, raceways or tanks. <b>Tanks</b> <b>and</b> <b>raceways</b> are more productive than ponds, but require higher ﬂow rates and regulated nutrient regimes...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Tilapia is {{the common}} name applied to three genera of fish in the family Cichlidae: Oreochromis, Sarotherodon, and Tilapia. The species that are most {{important}} for aquaculture are in the genus Oreochromis, including the Nile tilapia, O. niloticus, the Mozambique tilapia, O. mossambicus, the blue tilapia, O. aureus, and O. urolepis hornorum. Fish farmers are now growing many strains of these parent species along with many hybrid strains. Native to Africa and the Middle East, these species have become {{the second most common}} farm raised food fish in the world. In the 1960 s and 1970 s tilapia culture was aimed at the production of food for local consumption, utilizing primarily extensive or semiintensive culture methods with minimal inputs of fertilizer or feeds. However, tilapia culture has expanded rapidly during the last decade as a result of technological advances associated with the intensification of culture practices. These include the development of new strains and hybrids, monosex male culture, formulated diets, a variety of semiintensive and intensive culture systems (e. g., ponds, cages, <b>tanks,</b> <b>and</b> <b>raceways)</b> and the utilization of greenhouses, geothermal, or industrial waste heat and advanced water treatment methods. Marketing programs have also nurtured a growin...|$|E
40|$|Brown trout (Salmo trutta) {{broodstock}} from {{a single}} population were separated prior to spawning and exposed to two different holding environments: a ‘raceway system’ and a ‘tank system’. Eggs were stripped from females and 13 measures of egg quality were collected, analysed individually, combined by principle components analysis into an integrated egg quality score which was validated against egg survival. The multivariate egg quality score (PC 1) differed for fish held in the <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> <b>raceway</b> systems. Egg survival, chorion breaking strength and chorion Se concentrations were higher in eggs produced by broodstock held in the tank system compared {{to those in the}} raceway system. In contrast, chorion concentrations of P and K were higher in eggs from fish held in the raceway system. The results suggest that brown trout broodstock reared in tank systems produced higher quality eggs compared to trout reared in raceways. Finally, this study also indicates that multivariate statistical analysis can be used to determine egg quality from multiple egg parameters...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} water {{movement}} or agitation on the biological performance of planktonic organisms under intensive culture have been rarely studied quantitatively. Stagnation or minimum values are considered {{important in the}} problem of scale-up based on optimum conditions. Near stagnation, inadequate water movement brings about undesirable effects, e. g. accumulation of metabolites, uneven distribution of feed and low dissolved oxygen concentration. An important mechanism associated with water movement at these conditions is the oxygenation process which defines the oxygen transfer rate from the gas to the water. Experiments were conducted using potable water to determine the overall oxygen mass transfer coefficient in two types of container geometries: a) cylindri-conical <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> b) oblong-shaped center-partitioned raceway. For each type of container, three geometrically similar sizes were investigated with scale ratio of approximately 1 : 2 : 3 : 5. Agitation was induced {{by the introduction of}} air into the system. General correlations for both tank geometries were obtained from experimental data and were expressed in terms of the operating and geometric parameters. The correlations are in the form of dimensionless groups (Froude and Reynolds numbers) making them appropriate for scale-up estimates. The general correlations for the overall oxygen mass transfer coefficient were subsequently used to provide the scaling equations to define the operating parameters in different sizes of containers for the culture of brine shrimp in sea water fed with rice bran. The high correlation coefficient obtained for the relationship between total brine shrimp biomass production and the overall mass transfer coefficient applicable to different sizes of both the cylindri-conical <b>tank</b> <b>and</b> the <b>raceway</b> indicates that the overall oxygen mass transfer coefficient is an effective scale-up criterion in brine shrimp culture...|$|R

40|$|The stress {{responses}} of migrating smolts of chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss (formerly Salmo gairdneri) to passage through three flumes (small baffled, large baffled, and unbaffled with corrugations) {{were determined by}} assaying plasma cortisol concentrations before and after fish passed through each flume. The flumes were tested under three conditions: nighttime, partly darkened in the daytime (400 - 900 lx at surface of water), and completely darkened in the daytime (1 - 4 lx). Flume design significantly affected post-passage cortisol concentrations in steelhead but not in chinook salmon smolts; concentrations were lowest in steelhead smolts that passed through the corrugated flume. In daytime tests, cortisol concentrations were significantly lower in chinook salmon smolts that passed through completely darkened flumes than in those that passed through partly darkened flumes. Cortisol concentrations did not, however, differ significantly in steelhead smolts that passed through partly and completely darkened flumes. Plasma cortisol concentrations followed a diel cycle in chinook salmon smolts held in both darkened (1 - 4 lx) and undarkened (3, 800 lx) <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> <b>raceways</b> for 40 - 60 h, being higher by day than by night.

40|$|All {{water for}} the Ennis NFH is {{supplied}} from Blaine Spring which surfaces about 3 mile north of the hatchery. The water flows about 600 feet before it is collected into pipelines to the hatchery. Buildings and a hypalon cover have been placed over both arms of the spring. This water at the ground source is low in oxygen (6. 3 ppm, 71 % saturation) and supersaturated (130 %) with nitrogen gas. The water must be treated to make it suitable for fish production. Historically the untreated water, after flowing through about 1000 feet of pipe and entering <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> <b>raceways</b> at the hatchery, contained about 7. 5 ppm oxygen (85 % saturation) and 110 % to 115 % nitrogen gas. Total gas averaged about 108 % saturation. Under the above conditions, the fish were severely stressed with gas bubble disease {{as evidenced by the}} presence of gas bubbles in blood vessels, under the skin, in the gills and behind the eyeballs. Mortality of sac fry and swim up fry was excessive. Prior to installation of packed columns, post spawning mortality was as much as 50 % among females and 50 % to 100 % of males.

40|$|Giant clams are {{the largest}} extant {{bivalves}} and widespread inhabitants of the Indo-Pacific coral reefs. These organisms are particularly sought after by the food industry because of their large mantle and adductor muscle, while also {{are relevant to the}} aquarium trade market. The aquaculture of giant clams is dependent of a land-based hatchery divided in several tanks with different purposes for larval rearing. Prior to reproductive events, broodstock are conditioned and gametogensis is stimulated by frequent food additions, increased photoperiod and intense physical-chemical stability at optimum conditions. Several different methods can be employed to induce spawning, most notoriously the intragonadal injection of serotonin, thermal stress and addition of macerated gonadal tissue of a conspecific. The success of the method is based on spawning occurrence, time for response and events of broodstock mortality. After spawning, gametes are fertilized and a succession of planktonic larval stages is cultured in hatching <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> <b>raceways.</b> Embryonic development lasts for approximately 12 hours until the hatch of free-swimming and non-feeding trochophore larvae. After 24 hours post-fertilization larvae morph into veliger stage, made evident by the presence of calcium carbonate shells and velum. Veliger larva are fed with live or preserved phytoplankton and must also acquire symbiotic zooxanthellae. The last stage is the pediveliger stage at approximately one week post-fertilization, when settlement takes place and metamorphosis is soon attained...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Mixed-cell Raceway (MCR) is {{a design}} that intends to combine the best {{characteristics}} of circular <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> linear <b>raceways</b> in a single production system. The conceptual idea is to convert traditional linear raceways {{into a series of}} hydraulically separated cells, each of which behaves as an individual circular tank. The MCR {{can take advantage of the}} solids removal ability of circular <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> can be managed as either a partial reuse or intensive recirculation system. This study investigated the hydrodynamics of a large-scale (90 m 3) MCR composed of three in-series 5. 5 m× 5. 5 m mixed-cells (∼ 1 m water depth). Water velocity measurements of the entire tank were used to generate velocity-magnitude contours and vector plots, investigate the distribution of water velocities, and evaluate the self-cleaning characteristics and related management issues of an MCR. The grand mean of the water velocities of the three MCR in-series cells was 16. 5 cm/s (16. 1, 15. 5, and 17. 8 cm/s for cell 1, cell 2, and cell 3, respectively). Results showed that water velocities decreased somewhat in a linear manner from the tank bottom to the top, i. e., 18. 9, 15. 8 and 14. 7 cm/s, and in the same way from the periphery (21. 9 cm/s) to the center of the cells (3. 7 cm/s). Analyses indicated that these water velocities were in the optimum range to promote fish health and condition as well as to achieve tank self-cleaning. For a water exchange rate of 1. 7 volumes per hour and an operating head of 1. 36 m in the jet port manifolds, the power requirements of the MCR reached 8. 9 W/m 3. Contour and vector velocity plots showed that the mixed-cells develop a well-defined rotational pattern around the center drain. Also, strategically located water jets directed across the width of the MCR were able to limit the rotational flow to each cell and create the required counter-rotational pattern between adjacent cells. Velocity vectors showed a relatively low turbulence in the corners of the cells, even in the middle cell (cell 2) that had solid-walls on only two sides. Velocity vectors and contour plots also suggested an absence of dead volumes or short-circuiting within the cells, indicating that adequate mixing was being attained in the MCR...|$|R

40|$|With {{the decline}} in wild fish stock due to over fishing, habitat loss and the {{increased}} demand for fish as a food source, the aquaculture industry has become an important component {{in the global economy}} not only in a consumable goods sense but also as a means of stock replenishment through release programs. Capture fisheries reached their maximum sustainable yield of 100 million metric tons (MMT) more than ten years ago, and the demand for seafood has shown no signs of abating (FAO 2004). The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations’ annual report states that in 2002, aquaculture supplied 29. 9 % of the global supply (FAO 2004). In aquaculture, fish are commonly reared in net cages, ponds, <b>tanks,</b> <b>and</b> <b>raceways.</b> Aquaculture systems are typically designed to optimize water quality, which results in flow parameters that may not be optimal for growth. Fish with increased growth rates reach marketable size faster and with a higher proportion of muscle mass. A faster growth rate also allows individuals to more rapidly achieve a size suitable for over-wintering in tanks, possibly decreasing the high mortality seen in fingerlings in aquaculture. This would lead to decreasing the release time, enhancing the stock replenishment, and decreasing the holding costs to the hatchery. The early rearing conditions have a substantial influence on muscle growth and proliferation of muscle fibers (Johnston 2001 a) making exploration of growth conditions for early juveniles an attractive area of focus for aquaculture...|$|E
40|$|The stress {{response}} of chinook salmon and steelhead trout smolts to passage through three different flumes was tested by assaying plasma cortisol concentrations {{before and after}} flume passage. In addition, descaling of fish was recorded before and after flume passage, {{and the ability of}} the flumes to pass adult chinook salmon and debris was determined. The three flumes were a corrugated metal flume (CMF), a 4 -foot wide baffled flume (BF 4), and a 2 -foot wide baffled flume (BF 2). Each flume was tested under three conditions: (1) at nights, (2) during the day with a perforated metal cover, which reduced the amount of light entering the flume by about half (partially darkened), and (3) during the day with the perforated cover and an additional double layer of black plastic (completely darkened). Plasma cortisol concentrations were not significantly elevated in chinook salmon smolts after passage through any of the flumes (P 3 ̆e 0. 2, ANOVA). In daytime tests of partially and completely darkened flumes cortisol concentrations were consistently decreased following flume passage. We attribute this to pre-test stress (holding of fish in small tanks) and to the absence of a strong {{stress response}} to flume passage. Flume design did not {{have a significant effect on}} cortisol concentrations (P = 0. 9). Total darkening of the flumes during daytime was beneficial: cortisol concentrations were lower (P = 0. 03) in chinook salmon smolts passing through completely darkened flumes than in smolts passing through partially darkened flumes. In steelhead trout smolts, plasma cortisol concentrations were significantly elevated after passage through the flumes, and flume design did have a significant effect (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001, ANOVA). Cortisol concentrations were most increased in fish that had passed through the BF 2, followed by fish that passed through the BF 4. The smallest increase occurred in fish than passed through the CMF. Complete darkening of the flumes during daytime tests did not have a significant effect on cortisol concentrations (P= 0. 4). Plasma cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in daytime than in nighttime samples of chinook salmon smolts held in darkened and undarkened <b>tanks</b> <b>and</b> <b>raceways.</b> This diel cortisol cycle was unaffected by light intensity. The cortisol response to passage through darkened flumes was greater in nighttime than in daytime tests with both species. None of the flumes tested caused descaling of fish. Descaling was measured in two ways: as a mean percent of body area descaled, and as the percent of fish in a sample with greater than 5...|$|E
