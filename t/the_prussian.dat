5|$|Kronprinz (Crown Prince) {{was built}} for <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> Navy in 1866–1867. The ship was laid down in 1866 at the Samuda Brothers {{shipyard}} at Cubitt Town in London. She was launched in May 1867 and commissioned into <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> Navy that September. The ship was the fourth ironclad ordered by <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> Navy, after , , and , though she entered service before Friedrich Carl. Kronprinz was built as an armored frigate, armed with a main battery of sixteen 21cm (8.3in) guns; several smaller guns were added later in her career.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} 13, Domery had {{enlisted in}} <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> Army, and became part of an army besieging Thionville during the War of the First Coalition. <b>The</b> <b>Prussian</b> Army was {{suffering}} from food shortages which Domery found intolerable; he entered the town and surrendered to the French commander who rewarded him with a large melon, which Domery immediately ate, including the rind. He was then given {{a wide variety of}} other foodstuffs by the French general, all of which he ate straight away.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{differences}} on other matters, discussed at length in Carl von Clausewitz's {{study of the}} Campaign of 1815 and Wellington's famous 1842 essay in reply to it, <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> Clausewitz agreed with Wellington on this assessment. Indeed, Clausewitz viewed the battle prior to <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> intervention more as a mutually exhausting stalemate than as an impending French victory, with the advantage, if any, leaning towards Wellington.|$|E

50|$|The Chronicon terrae Prussiae {{stated that}} Herkus was {{originally}} from Natangia, {{one of the}} lands of <b>the</b> Old <b>Prussians.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Prussians</b> were <b>the</b> first of the Baltic tribes to be conquered by the Teutonic Knights, who first arrived in Chełmno in 1226 {{at the request of}} Konrad I of Masovia, whose own struggle with <b>the</b> <b>Prussians</b> had proved unsuccessful. As part of the Northern Crusades, the Knights proceeded to attack <b>the</b> <b>Prussians</b> with <b>the</b> purported aim of converting them to Christianity.|$|R
50|$|The {{battle was}} a {{strategic}} victory for <b>the</b> <b>Prussians.</b> Bazaine {{had failed to}} make it to Verdun. In a short time, <b>the</b> <b>Prussians</b> trapped Bazaine in the city, and the siege of Metz ensued.|$|R
5|$|In 1594, Albert Frederick's then 14-year-old {{daughter}} Anna {{married the}} son of Joachim Frederick of Hohenzollern-Brandenburg, John Sigismund. The marriage ensured the right of succession in <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> duchy {{as well as in}} Cleves. Upon George Frederick's death in 1603, the regency of <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> duchy passed to Joachim Frederick. Also in 1603, the Treaty of Gera was concluded by the members of the House of Hohenzollern, ruling that their territories were not to be internally divided in the future.|$|E
5|$|In Prussia, {{a reform}} in 1816 defined <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> civil pound {{in terms of}} <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> foot and {{distilled}} water. It also redefined the apothecaries' pound as 12 ounces, i.e. 3/4, of the civil pound: 350.78g. This reform was not popular with apothecaries, because it broke the uniformity of the apothecaries' pound in Germany {{at a time when}} a German national state was beginning to form. It seems that many apothecaries did not follow this reduction by 2%.|$|E
5|$|King Frederick William IV {{suffered}} a stroke in 1857 and could no longer rule. This led to his brother William becoming Prince Regent of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1858. Meanwhile, Helmuth von Moltke had become chief of <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> General Staff in 1857, and Albrecht von Roon would become Prussian Minister of War in 1859. This shuffling of authority within <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> military establishment would have important consequences. Von Roon and William (who took an active interest in military structures) began reorganizing <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> army, while Moltke redesigned the strategic defense of Prussia by streamlining operational command. Prussian army reforms (especially {{how to pay for}} them) caused a constitutional crisis beginning in 1860 because both parliament and William—via his minister of war—wanted control over the military budget. William, crowned King Wilhelm I in 1861, appointed Otto von Bismarck to the position of Minister-President of Prussia in 1862. Bismarck resolved the crisis in favor of the war minister.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the growing}} {{intensity}} of attacks, Pope Honorius III sent a papal bull to Christian in March 1217 allowing him to begin preaching a crusade against <b>the</b> militant <b>Prussians.</b> <b>The</b> following year the pagans attacked Chełmno Land and Masovia again, plundering 300 cathedrals and churches. Duke Conrad of Masovia succeeded in expelling <b>the</b> <b>Prussians</b> by paying a huge tribute, which only encouraged <b>the</b> <b>Prussians,</b> however.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> next <b>Prussian</b> {{attack was}} {{directed}} at the center-right position at the hamlet of Zames where they encountered the Veronese 45th regiment of Piret's brigade, which they easily drove off. 9th Brigade was able to occupy the hamlet {{in the center of}} the Austrian position with two battalions. Neither Piret's brigade, nor Leiningen's reserve, were sent in to plug the hole in the Austrian center, leaving <b>the</b> <b>Prussians</b> in control of the center of the Austrian line. The feeble counterattacks by hussars from 1st Light Cavalry Division were easily held off by <b>the</b> <b>Prussians.</b> <b>The</b> Austrian artillery, bombarding the hamlet, then set Zames aflame, forcing <b>the</b> <b>Prussians</b> holding <b>the</b> hamlet to attack forward towards Dilec. <b>The</b> advancing <b>Prussians</b> were then able to beat the Saxons to Dilec and occupied the town at 7:30 PM. To plug this hole and to aid the faltering Saxons, Piret decided to attack <b>the</b> <b>Prussians</b> on his left but Piret was easily held off by <b>the</b> <b>Prussians,</b> reinforced by Tümpling's reserve battalion, and their use of the superior Dreyse needle gun to smash the Austrian storm columns, which then collapsed and fled. Simultaneously Werder's attack towards Lochov, in order to outflank Ringelsheim, caused the collapse of the Austrian left as well, and <b>the</b> <b>Prussians</b> were able to push Abele and Ringelsheim back to Jičín, which they eventually occupied at 10:30 PM.|$|R
5000|$|The Battle of Woerth {{was fought}} on December 23, 1793 and {{resulted}} {{the victory of}} the French under General Hoche against <b>the</b> <b>Prussians</b> under General Hotze. <b>The</b> <b>Prussians</b> redoubts were taken at bayonet by French soldiers [...]|$|R
5|$|Offsetting these handicaps, <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> Army had {{excellent}} and professional leadership in its General Staff organisation. These officers came from four schools developed {{for this purpose}} and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was {{in marked contrast to}} the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> army concentrated for battle with 24 hours notice.|$|E
5|$|The Camäleon {{class was}} based on the earlier s, though they were {{significantly}} larger. <b>The</b> <b>Prussian</b> Navy had determined that larger gunboats with more powerful engines would be more versatile for peacetime use; members of <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> House of Representatives suggested the vessels could be used for commercial voyages. The Landtag authorized funds for the first four ships of the Camäleon class in 1859, and the design was prepared by Chief Constructor Carl Elbertzhagen. In 1860, the Landtag approved another four vessels of the class.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Prussian</b> {{army was}} {{in the throes of}} reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and Freikorps {{volunteer}} formations from the wars of 1813–1814 {{were in the process of}} being absorbed into the line, along with many Landwehr (militia) regiments. The Landwehr were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. <b>The</b> <b>Prussian</b> cavalry were in a similar state. Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance– guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Prussians</b> arrived {{first and}} managed to break through at the western (Mühlenthor) gate, driving the outnumbered Swedes in disarray through the streets. However, {{reinforcements}} arrived, and <b>the</b> <b>Prussians,</b> who had failed to burn the bridge, were forced to retreat.|$|R
6000|$|Amid cannonading {{from both}} sides they draw nearer to <b>the</b> <b>Prussians,</b> [...] though lanes are cut through them by the latter's guns. They drive [...] <b>the</b> <b>Prussians</b> out of Ligny; who, however, rally in the houses, [...] churchyard, and village green.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Prussians</b> {{lost their}} entire horse {{artillery}}, {{an amalgam of}} cavalry and artillery in which the crews rode horses into battle, dragging their cannons behind them, one of Frederick's notable inventions. <b>The</b> <b>Prussians</b> also lost 60 percent of their cavalry, killed or wounded, animals and men. <b>The</b> <b>Prussians</b> lost 172 of their own cannons plus the 105 that they had captured from the Russians in the late morning on the Mühlberge. They also lost 27 flags and two standards.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Prussian</b> uprisings {{were two}} major and three smaller uprisings by the Prussians, {{one of the}} Baltic tribes, against the Teutonic Knights {{that took place in}} the 13th century during <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> Crusade. The crusading {{military}} order, supported by the Popes and Christian Europe, sought to conquer and convert the pagan Prussians. In the first ten years of the crusade five of the seven major Prussian clans fell under the control of the less numerous Teutonic Knights. However, the Prussians rose against their conquerors on five occasions.|$|E
5|$|The second {{episode in}} Bismarck's {{unification}} efforts occurred in 1866. In {{concert with the}} newly formed Italy, Bismarck created a diplomatic environment in which Austria declared war on Prussia. The dramatic prelude to the war occurred largely in Frankfurt, where the two powers claimed to speak for all the German states in the parliament. In April 1866, <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> representative in Florence signed a secret agreement with the Italian government, committing each state to assist {{the other in a}} war against Austria. The next day, <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> delegate to the Frankfurt assembly presented a plan calling for a national constitution, a directly elected national Diet, and universal suffrage. German liberals were justifiably skeptical of this plan, having witnessed Bismarck's difficult and ambiguous relationship with <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> Landtag (State Parliament), a relationship characterized by Bismarck's cajoling and riding roughshod over the representatives. These skeptics saw the proposal as a ploy to enhance Prussian power rather than a progressive agenda of reform.|$|E
5|$|This last attempt {{effectively}} ended <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> Crusade and the Knights {{concentrated on}} conquering Samogitia and Lithuania. Lithuanian historians note that fierce resistance by the Prussians won {{time for the}} young Lithuanian state to mature and strengthen so it could withstand the hundred-year crusade, culminating in the 1410 Battle of Grunwald, with minimal territorial losses. <b>The</b> <b>Prussian</b> lands were repopulated by colonists from Germany, who after the 16th century eventually outnumbered the natives. It is estimated that around 1400 Prussians numbered 100,000 and comprised {{about half of the}} total population in Prussia. The Prussians were subject to Germanization and assimilation and eventually became extinct sometime after the 16th century. It is believed that <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> language became extinct sometime {{at the beginning of the}} 18th century.|$|E
50|$|Houchard {{surprised}} <b>the</b> <b>Prussians,</b> who, believing themselves safe in Limburg, {{had established}} negligible defenses. The French quietly installed their batteries before the enemy {{even thought of}} defending themselves. Nevertheless, after some hesitation, <b>the</b> <b>Prussians</b> brought out their troops, who threw themselves into battle, sowing some confusion. French artillery fire forced them to retreat. The French expelled <b>the</b> <b>Prussians</b> from <b>the</b> city, who retreat to Montabaur, while the French fortified themselves in their conquest. The entire battle took 90 minutes.|$|R

50|$|The Bartians, {{along with}} <b>the</b> other <b>Prussians,</b> were conquered by the Teutonic Knights, who Christianized them, brought in {{newcomers}}, and built many towns and cities. <b>The</b> <b>Prussians</b> assimilated with <b>the</b> newcomers and <b>the</b> Old <b>Prussian</b> language became extinct {{by the end}} of the 17th century.|$|R
5|$|Zieten had by {{this time}} brought up his 1st Brigade, but had become {{concerned}} {{at the sight of}} stragglers and casualties from the Nassau units on Wellington's left and from <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> 15th Brigade. These troops appeared to be withdrawing and Zieten, fearing that his own troops would be caught up in a general retreat, was starting to move away from Wellington's flank and towards <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> main body near Plancenoit. Zieten had also received a direct order from Blücher to support Bülow, which Zieten obeyed and marched to Bülow's aid.|$|E
5|$|By mid-March, <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> {{ships were}} ready for action and the ice had receded far enough that Prince Adalbert ordered Jachmann to conduct a {{reconnaissance}} of the blockading force on 16 March. In the meantime, Dockum's squadron had arrived off Swinemünde two days before. Arcona and Nymphe patrolled off Greifswald, but the weather was very poor, with snow showers hampering visibility. <b>The</b> <b>Prussian</b> gunboats, led by the paddle steamer , remained closer to Swinemünde. Jachmann spotted three vessels at around 15:30, but {{there was not enough}} time before dark to catch them. Instead, Jachmann turned back to Swinemünde, intending to try again the following day.|$|E
5|$|For most of {{the twentieth}} and at the {{beginning}} of the twentieth-first centuries, the painting has been hung in the National Museum gallery in the Sukiennice Museum in Kraków, where it is usually displayed in <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> Homage Hall.|$|E
5000|$|Passing beyond Saint-Gratien, <b>the</b> 31st <b>Prussian</b> Brigade (von Gneissnau) {{received}} {{an order to}} reach Montigny-sur-l'Hallue. At about 3 p.m. <b>the</b> <b>Prussians</b> brought into action with the 2nd French Brigade (Pittié) of the Derroja Division; {{after the fall of}} Montigny, they pushed the French back towards Béhencourt, who, in their withdrawal, destroyed the Hallue bridges, but <b>the</b> <b>Prussians</b> under a strong fireguns, launched a foot-bridge over the river.|$|R
50|$|The Warmians, {{along with}} <b>the</b> other <b>Prussians,</b> were conquered by the Teutonic Knights, a crusading {{military}} order under direct {{command of the}} pope. The Knights conquered <b>the</b> <b>Prussians</b> and converted them to Christianity. Many cities and towns were built and the population increased by bringing in colonists from Germany and Poland, {{as well as other}} countries of Europe. <b>The</b> <b>Prussians</b> were eventually assimilated by the colonists and <b>the</b> Old <b>Prussian</b> language became extinct {{by the end of the}} 17th century or beginning of the 18th century.|$|R
50|$|The French forces under Marshal François Achille Bazaine {{attempted}} {{to break through}} the lines of <b>the</b> <b>Prussians</b> investing Metz.

5|$|Frederick William's {{excise tax}} (Akzise), which since 1667 {{replaced}} {{the property tax}} raised in Brandenburg for Brandenburg-Prussia's standing army with the estates' consent, was raised by the elector without consultation of the estates. The conclusion of the Second Northern War had strengthened the elector politically, enabling him to reform the constitution of Cleves and Mark in 1660 and 1661 to introduce officials loyal to him and independent of the local estates. In the Duchy of Prussia, he confirmed the traditional privileges of the estates in 1663, but the latter accepted the caveat that these privileges {{were not to be}} used to interfere with the exertion of the elector's sovereignty. As in Brandenburg, Frederick William ignored the privilege of <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> estates to confirm or veto taxes raised by the elector: while in 1656, an Akzise was raised with the estates' consent, the elector by force collected taxes not approved by <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> estates {{for the first time in}} 1674. Since 1704, <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> estates had de facto relinquished their right to approve the elector's taxes while formally still entitled to do so. In 1682, the elector introduced an Akzise to Pomerania and in 1688 to Magdeburg, while in Cleves and Mark an Akzise was introduced only between 1716 and 1720. Due to Frederick William's reforms, the state income increased threefold during his reign, and the tax burden per subject reached a level twice as high as in France.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Carl {{was built}} for <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> Navy in the mid-1860s in the French Societé Nouvelles des Forges et Chantiers {{shipyard}} in Toulon. Built as an armored frigate, she mounted her main battery of sixteen 21cm guns on the broadside. Her hull was laid in 1866 and launched in January 1867. The ship was commissioned into <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> Navy in October 1867, after which she served with the fleet. During the Franco-Prussian War, the ship formed part of the main German squadron commanded by Vice Admiral Jachmann. Engine trouble, however, plagued the ship {{and two of the}} other three vessels in the squadron; as a result, they made only two sorties from the port of Wilhelmshaven to challenge the French blockade. Neither resulted in combat.|$|E
5|$|Geographically, Protestantism is {{concentrated}} in the northern, central and eastern parts of the country. These are mostly members of the EKD, which encompasses Lutheran, Reformed and administrative or confessional unions of both traditions dating back to <b>the</b> <b>Prussian</b> Union of 1817. Roman Catholicism {{is concentrated}} {{in the south and}} west.|$|E
50|$|Wellington was {{to stand}} fast {{to receive the}} attack, whilst <b>the</b> <b>Prussians</b> should close round Napoleon's exposed right and support Wellington's left. <b>The</b> <b>Prussians</b> were thus <b>the</b> real general reserve, and it was Wellington's task to receive Napoleon's attack and prepare him for the decisive counter-stroke.|$|R
5|$|The first {{uprising}} {{was supported}} by Duke Swietopelk II, Duke of Pomerania. <b>The</b> <b>Prussians</b> were successful at first, reducing the Knights to only five of their strongest castles. Conversely, the duke suffered a series of military defeats and was eventually forced {{to make peace with}} the Teutonic Knights. With Duke Swietopelk's support for <b>the</b> <b>Prussians</b> broken, a prelate of Pope Innocent IV then negotiated a peace treaty between <b>the</b> <b>Prussians</b> and <b>the</b> Knights. However, this treaty was never honored or enforced, especially after the Battle of Krücken at the end of 1249.|$|R
