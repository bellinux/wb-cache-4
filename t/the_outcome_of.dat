These choices are typically moral decisions made through Jodie's dialogue options, interventions with various characters, success or failure in her combat scenes, or psychic actions that the player chooses to have Aiden perform. Examples of choice-based outcomes are the chapter titled The Party, where the player is given the choice of unleashing brutal revenge toward a group of bullies or simply running away, and the chapter titled The Embassy, where the player can either engage in psychic information retrieval or can jeopardize the mission by forcing one of the guards to commit suicide. Choices also determine the finale of Beyond: Two Souls, as any number of possible plot endings can be experienced by the player.|$|E

The study sorted out the general grounds for applying <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> task-related detecting operation at criminal trial, namely: a) by their relevance for immediate investigation, or preliminary inquiry or court trial; b) by their form of presentation (in writing, orally); c) depending on transcripts available upon {{the sources of}} information received. The study considered several issues <b>of</b> applying <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carried task-related detecting operations {{that should not be}} subject to transcripts, and particularly emphasized that generally such outcomes to apply for tactical purposes, while setting out leads.   The author presented the survey upon statistics data showing <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> study conducted on implementation by task force officers of a task-related detecting operation named «interrogatories». Thus, 39 % of respondents explained that «interrogatories» gave rise to taking statements for using them in criminal trial, 37 % made use of statements taken for task-related purposes, 13 % conduct «interrogatories» for preparing and carrying out other TRDO, 11 % use TRDO «interrogatories» for tactical purposes. Finally, the paper examined a contribution made by the «Instructions on a procedure <b>of</b> presenting <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> task-related detecting operation to a body of immediate investigation, to a preliminary inquiry officer or in court» in completing criminal proceedings with <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> task-related detecting operation data.   </p...|$|R

5|$|Herodotus {{tells us}} that, on seeing <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> the battle {{hung in the}} balance, the {{disarmed}} Samians had joined in {{on the side of}} the allies, doing what they could. This inspired the other Ionian contingents to turn on the Persians as well. At which stage in the battle this happened is not clear; the Samians were presumably not in the main battle line (being disarmed), so it may have been after the Persians retreated to the camp.
