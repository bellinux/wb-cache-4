A keen stamp collector, he was once at his local philately club's annual meeting, more than 40 years after the war, when he fell into a {{conversation}} about politics with <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> to him. The man {{told him it was}} [...] "terrible" [...] that Holocaust denial was illegal in Germany, and went on to tell Gröning how so many bodies could not have been burnt, and that the volume of gas that {{was supposed to have been}} used would have killed all living things in the vicinity.|$|E
500|$|For {{the landing}} each man carried a {{rucksack}} weighing [...] containing extra ammunition, for the Brens, mortars, Vickers K guns and PIATs. This {{was on top}} of their own personal weapon and ammunition. Unusually each man chose whether to would wear a steel helmet or the Commando green beret. No. 4 Commando were in the second wave and landed behind the initial assault battalion, from the East Yorkshire Regiment, part of the 3rd Infantry Division. Captain Porteous described how their dead and wounded were [...] "just swilling around in the water." [...] Captain McDougal later wrote, [...] "as we were coming ashore the assault troops were committing suicide by trying to dig in on the beach. In passing I kicked the nearest man telling him to keep going. The man was dead. So was <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> to him and a third was seriously wounded by machine gun fire." [...] The Commandos followed their drills and cleared the beach as quickly as possible. Once clear they headed for their assembly area, which was also the commando medical post. Leaving their rucksacks behind, they set off along the Lion sur Mer road towards their objectives.|$|E

500|$|The phalanx {{formation}} used by Greek armies had {{a distinct}} tendency to veer {{to the right}} during battle, [...] "because fear makes each man do his best to shelter his unarmed side with the shield of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> him on the right". Traditionally, a phalanx therefore lined up for battle with the elite troops on the right flank to counter this tendency. Thus, in the Spartan phalanx at Leuctra, Cleombrotus and the elite 'Spartiates' were on the right, while the less experienced Peloponnesian allies were on the left. However, needing to counter the Spartans' numerical advantage, Epaminondas implemented two tactical innovations. Firstly, he took the best troops in the army, and arranged them 50 ranks deep (as opposed to the normal 812 ranks) on the left wing, opposite Cleombrotus and the Spartans, with Pelopidas and the Sacred Band on the extreme left flank.* Davis, 100 Decisive Battles, 24; Gabriel, The Great Armies of Antiquity, 182183 [...] Secondly, recognizing, {{that he could not}} have matched the width of the Peloponnesian phalanx (even before the deepening the left flank), he abandoned all attempts to do so. [...] Instead, placing the weaker troops on the right flank, he [...] "instructed them to avoid battle and withdraw gradually during the enemy's attack". The tactic of the deep phalanx had been anticipated by Pagondas, another Theban general, who used a 25 man deep formation at the Battle of Delium.* Kagan, The Archidamian War, 283 However, the reversing of the position of the elite troops, and an oblique line of attack were innovations; it seems that Epaminondas was therefore responsible for the military tactic of refusing one's flank.* Davis, 100 Decisive Battles, 24; Gabriel, The Great Armies of Antiquity, 182; Hanson, The Soul of Battle ...|$|E
500|$|Sam Lansky of {{the website}} Idolator, noted how the video was a [...] "high-concept" [...] one further [...] "balancing out the {{low-level}} minimalism of the... track with arresting visuals and a star-studded cast". Mike Wass {{of the same}} website deemed it a recreation of the riot scene of the singer's own [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] (2011). He further described Destiny's Child reunion as [...] "heartwarming". Michelle Collins, a journalist of Vanity Fair echoed his statements, noting how the band reunion was the video's key moment. Although Anupa Mistry of Spin felt that the video for [...] "Superpower" [...] {{was one of the}} [...] "relatively mundane" [...] on the visual album, it was a feat of [...] "production value and styling". Kathy Iandoli from Vice, praised the singer's overall look in the clip. MuuMuse's [...] Bradley Stern felt the clip was one of the singer's [...] "most artistic moment", praising her [...] "ridiculously sexy stealth superhero outfit". He interpreted the wall of police officers as critics, political statements and life obstacles and concluded that the last image where the singer is seen holding hands with <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> to her is a [...] "lasting" [...] one. The Fader writer Michael Zelenko said that the clip resembled a short movie with Beyoncé as [...] "an Occupy-style protest heroine leading a ragtag gang". Listing it as the fifth best video on the album, Melinda Newman of HitFix elaborated how the video managed to transform the [...] "simple love ballad into a political statement", furthering how it added meaning to its lyrics. rent DiCrescenzo of the magazine Time Out named it the sixth best on the album. Trent Wolbe of The Verge criticized Åkerlund's work on the album, feeling that his contributions [...] "feel like boring opulence porn", something he found on [...] "Superpower".|$|E
2500|$|The nave of the {{basilica}} {{was covered in}} mosaics representing Old Testament events of Moses leading the Jews out of Egypt across the Red Sea. [...] "The nave mosaics (which represents stories of Old Testament history and accordingly offered Christians in Rome a new 'past') are illusionistic in a colorful and impressionist manner" [...] as this scholar puts it the scene was filled with movement, emotion, and it was to inspire thinking of Rome's [...] "new" [...] past; the past of the Old Testament. As one scholar describes it: [...] "Moses strikes {{the waters of the}} Red Sea in a heroic gesture, his toga in light and dark grays and blues, but lined in black, the folds white lines, the tunic underneath light blue; <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>next</b> to him wears a deep blue toga over a gray and white tunic." [...] Another panel shows the demise of the Egyptians in the Red Sea. An observer describes the mosaic: [...] "The Egyptians, clad in blue armor with gold bands and scarlet cloaks wildly flying, drown in the greenish blue waters; the horses, white or light brown shaded with darker browns, highlighted in white, the accoutrements a bright red." ...|$|E
