5|$|Birds {{returning}} {{north in}} spring across the central Mediterranean appear {{to follow a}} well-defined route. Large concentrations of ruffs form every year at particular stopover sites to feed, and individuals marked with rings or dye reappear in subsequent years. The refuelling sites are closer together than the theoretical maximum <b>travel</b> <b>distance</b> calculated from the mean body mass, and provide evidence of a migration strategy using favoured intermediate sites. The ruff stores fat as a fuel, but unlike mammals, uses lipids as {{the main energy source}} for exercise (including migration) and, when necessary, keeps warm by shivering; however, little research has been conducted on the mechanisms by which they oxidise lipids.|$|E

25|$|The Ansei Treaties {{included}} stipulations {{restricting the}} area of activity open to foreign residents, and in Kobe this consisted of an area of ten ri (about 40km) around the Hyōgo prefectural office. In 1869, the prefecture released regulations concretely defining this 10-ri area in terms of actual <b>travel</b> <b>distance,</b> bounded by the sea {{to the south and}} by villages on all sides: to the east by Ōbe, Sakane, Hirai, and Nakashima in Kawabe District, the west by Sone and Amida in , and the north by Ōharano-mura in Kawabe District, Kawahara, Yado, Yakamishimo, and Inugai in , and Takō, Myōrakuji, and Yokō in Taka District. However, the foreign countries instead interpreted the ten ri as a radius of direct distance, expanding the treaty limits to encompass the entirety of Innami to the west and Kawabe, Taki, and Taka districts to the north. The space beyond this area was accessible to foreigners only for recreation and scholarship, and when foreigners did enter it they were obligated to carry a travel license from the prefectural office. In actuality, though, foreigners often left the treaty area without permission on excursions, which frequently caused trouble for the prefecture. When the settlement was returned in 1899, foreigners were permitted to reside and travel freely within Japan.|$|E

500|$|While some {{scientists}} have claimed other objects (such as Abell 1835 IR1916) have higher redshifts (and therefore {{are seen in}} an earlier stage of the Universe's evolution), IOK-1's age and composition have been more reliably established.

500|$|Launching the Musashi also {{presented}} problems. The ship's [...] thick launch platform, made of nine [...] Douglas fir planks bolted together, {{took two years}} to assemble (from keel-laying in March 1938) {{because of the difficulty}} in drilling perfectly straight bolt holes through 4m of fresh timber. The problem of slowing and stopping the massive hull once inside the narrow Nagasaki Harbour was met by attaching [...] of heavy chains {{on both sides of the}} hull to create dragging resistance in the water. The launch was concealed by means including a citywide air-raid drill staged on the launch day to keep people inside their homes. Musashi was launched on 1 November 1940, coming to a stop only [...] in excess of the hull's expected [...] <b>travel</b> <b>distance</b> across the harbour. The entry of such a large mass into the water caused a [...] tsunami, which swept the harbour and local rivers, flooding homes and capsizing small fishing boats. Musashi was fitted out at nearby Sasebo, with Captain Kaoru Arima assigned as her commanding officer.|$|E
500|$|Ruffed lemurs are {{the only}} known {{primates}} to build arboreal nests, used exclusively for birth {{and for the first}} week or two of life. Starting three weeks prior to birth, females begin constructing the nest from twigs, branches, leaves, and vines, locating it within her core area and [...] above ground. The nests have only one apparent entry point, and are shallow and dish-shaped. During the first couple of weeks, the mother is mostly solitary and does not travel far from the nest, spending as much as 70–90% of her time with the newborns (in captivity). In order to find food, she will leave the infants alone in the nest or, after the first couple of weeks, will carry them in her mouth and stash them in concealed locations in the canopy while she forages. Since this early developmental period corresponds {{with the end of the}} cold, dry season, which offers the least amount of fruit, energy is conserved for lactation while travel is limited. As the hot, rainy season begins, fruit availability rises, lactation demands rise as well, and females increase their <b>travel</b> <b>distance</b> in search of food.|$|E
