5|$|Convinced {{that he has}} {{not done}} {{anything}} wrong, Bart decides to run away from home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While wandering the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start to regret the bad things they said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He climbs up onto the roof of the house to <b>think</b> <b>things</b> out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E

Vašek {{tells them}} {{that he no longer}} wants to marry Mařenka, having learned her true nature from a beautiful, strange girl. They are horrified ("He does not want her – what has happened?"). Vašek runs off, and moments later Mařenka arrives with her parents. She has just learned of Jeník's deal with Kecal, and a lively {{ensemble}} ("No, no, I don't believe it") ensues. Matters are further complicated when Vašek returns, recognises Mařenka as his [...] "strange girl", and says that he will happily marry her. In the sextet which follows ("Make your mind up, Mařenka"), Mařenka is urged to <b>think</b> <b>things</b> over. They all depart, leaving her alone.|$|E
500|$|... "Climax" [...] {{was written}} by Usher, Redd Stylez, Ariel Rechtshaid, and Diplo, who also {{produced}} the song. Diplo introduced the song's concept to Usher, who was working {{with him on a}} new album. Usher wanted to expand his music's style and depth by working with Diplo. Diplo recounted the experience in an interview for The Guardian, saying that [...] "I had explained to him about a moment I had with a girl where I felt like I could die with her and be content, but I didn't and life moved on, and that point in my life was over. It was a sad feeling but it was beautiful. He was relating with me about the idea and how many times you <b>think</b> <b>things</b> are perfect and feel that way but they can pass." [...] They discussed the concept throughout the song's development and how it relates to Usher's life, as Diplo [...] "tried to help realise these lyrics and feelings." [...] After conceiving some melody lines, they wrote the song in about an hour.|$|E
500|$|In the United States, Chekhov's {{reputation}} {{began its}} rise slightly later, partly through {{the influence of}} Stanislavski's system of acting, with its notion of subtext: [...] "Chekhov often expressed his thought not in speeches," [...] wrote Stanislavski, [...] "but in pauses or between the lines or in replies consisting of a single word... the characters often feel and <b>think</b> <b>things</b> not expressed in the lines they speak." [...] The Group Theatre, in particular, developed the subtextual approach to drama, influencing generations of American playwrights, screenwriters, and actors, including Clifford Odets, Elia Kazan and, in particular, Lee Strasberg. In turn, Strasberg's Actors Studio and the [...] "Method" [...] acting approach influenced many actors, including Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro, though by then the Chekhov tradition may have been distorted by a preoccupation with realism. In 1981, the playwright Tennessee Williams adapted The Seagull as The Notebook of Trigorin. One of Anton's nephews, Michael Chekhov would also contribute heavily to modern theatre, particularly through his unique acting methods which developed Stanislavski's ideas further.|$|E

500|$|HeartGold and SoulSilver were {{released}} in 2009, {{ten years after}} Gold and Silvers release for the Game Boy Color. Shigeki Morimoto, the games' director, commented {{on the development of}} the remakes: [...] "The first thing that I knew I needed to bear in mind was to respect the feelings of those people who'd played Gold and Silver ten years before. I think that players have very strong memories of the game, so they'd <b>think</b> <b>things</b> like 'Ah, this trainer is still strong' and 'If I do this here, this is going to happen'. I knew I needed to respect these feelings." [...] However, Morimoto also needed to make sure that the games would feel as new games to players who began playing Pokémon in recent years on the Game Boy Advance or the Nintendo DS. An in-game author surrogate of Game Freak's President in Celadon City states that the team strove to make a game that would appeal to players with fond memories without [...] "redoing the same thing". He also states that making the game was a [...] "rewarding challenge". HeartGold and SoulSilver introduced many new features that were absent in the original Gold and Silver. Several of these features came from the previously released Nintendo DS Pokémon games, such as Diamond (2006), Pearl (2006), and Platinum (2008).|$|E
500|$|Kirkwood branded Mercedes [...] "a savvy, ballsy {{girl that}} can't say no and is unapologetic about it". Metcalfe has {{described}} Mercedes {{as someone who}} [...] "hates every woman in Hollyoaks" [...] except her own sisters, and as someone who talks too much and has a [...] "mouth like a foghorn". She {{went on to say}} that Mercedes [...] "always looks after her family and would never do anything to deliberately hurt them. Mercedes' heart is definitely in the right place". Metcalfe observed that Mercedes is [...] "completely mad" [...] and she [...] "just does whatever she feels like doing at the time. She doesn't exactly <b>think</b> <b>things</b> through". Metcalfe further explained that Mercedes did not [...] "consider consequences", which led her to unintentionally [...] "destroy everything". She elaborated on this, saying that Mercedes never has a happy ending [...] "because she can't. I don't think with Mercedes there is ever a happy ending. Just when something might go her way or something's going to go right for her, she destroys it". She said that her character is [...] "used to getting her own way" [...] so she thought that despite her actions, [...] "everything will turn out right in the end". She opined that Mercedes was at her best in this state, being [...] "minxy and destructive". Metcalfe described Mercedes in this way: [...] "Whatever she does that's bad, she manages to justify in her head. She doesn't have much self-worth and she knows what she's like". Metcalfe also expressed the hope that Mercedes could be happy [...] "free and single". She explained that Mercedes was unable to remain happy, saying: [...] "she has moments of happiness but ruins them herself". She went on to explain that due to Mercedes' first love having [...] "messed her up", Mercedes behaved [...] "the way she is where men are concerned". She further explained that Mercedes believed she could change but was disappointed when she could not. Metcalfe said, [...] "When she says that she's going to change, she actually means it; she just can't sustain it." ...|$|E

2500|$|By now firmly {{established}} as an outstanding bebop soloist, in 1960 Harriott turned {{to what he}} termed [...] "abstract" [...] or [...] "free-form" [...] music. He had been toying with some loose free-form ideas since the mid-1950s, but finally settled upon his conception in 1959, after a protracted spell in hospital with tuberculosis gave him time to <b>think</b> <b>things</b> over. At first he struggled to recruit other like-minded musicians to his vision. Indeed, two of his core band members, Harry South and Hank Shaw, left when these ideas surfaced. He finally settled on a line-up of Shake Keane (trumpet, flugelhorn), Pat Smythe (piano), Coleridge Goode (bass) and Phil Seamen (drums). Les Condon temporarily replaced Keane on trumpet in 1961, while Seamen left permanently the same year, his place taken by {{the return of the}} quintet's previous drummer, Bobby Orr. The legendary Frank Holder also toured with Harriott and contributed to recording projects over this period.|$|E
