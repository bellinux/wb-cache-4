500|$|Sam Wollaston for The Guardian said he {{was missing}} the interplay between Rodney and Del Boy from the original, {{and that the only}} fun in the drama was [...] "recognising the nods, working out who's who and how it all fits into place. Otherwise, it's pretty lame." [...] The Daily Mirrors Jim Shelley didn't find the storyline [...] "interesting or convincing", finding Lyndhurst's {{performance}} as Freddie [...] "laughable" [...] and saying it was [...] "bizarre" [...] that the storyline [...] "virtually abandoned its main character (the young Del Boy) and its best actor (the engaging James Buckley from The Inbetweeners) who played him". In The Independent, Tom Sutcliffe said that [...] "the narrative's focus was blurred and the pacing weirdly off – quite a lot of the <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> well ahead of the drama and hanging around for it to catch up with you". Benji Wilson from The Daily Telegraph also wasn't impressed saying the viewer would have been disappointed if they [...] "tuned in wanting to be entertained, enthused, or anything in between", and that it was an [...] "ocean-going stinker".|$|E
500|$|Snippets {{of voices}} between {{and over the}} music are another notable feature of the album. [...] During {{recording}} sessions, Waters recruited both the staff and the temporary occupants of the studio to answer {{a series of questions}} printed on flashcards. [...] The interviewees were placed in front of a microphone in a darkened Studio 3, and shown such questions as [...] "What's your favourite colour?" [...] and [...] "What's your favourite food?", before moving on to themes more central to the album (such as madness, violence, and death). [...] Questions such as [...] "When was the last <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> violent?", followed immediately by [...] "Were you in the right?", were answered in the order they were presented. Roger [...] "The Hat" [...] Manifold proved difficult to find, and was the only contributor recorded in a conventional sit-down interview, as by then the flashcards had been mislaid. [...] Waters asked him about a violent encounter he had had with another motorist, and Manifold replied [...] "...give 'em a quick, short, sharp shock..." [...] When asked about death he responded [...] "live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me..." [...] Another roadie, Chris Adamson, who was on tour with Pink Floyd, recorded the snippet which opens the album: [...] "I've been mad for fucking years – absolutely years". [...] The band's road manager Peter Watts (father of actress Naomi Watts) contributed the repeated laughter during [...] "Brain Damage" [...] and [...] "Speak to Me". [...] His second wife, Patricia [...] "Puddie" [...] Watts (now Patricia Gleason), was responsible for the line about the [...] "geezer" [...] who was [...] "cruisin' for a bruisin used in the segue between [...] "Money" [...] and [...] "Us and Them", and the words [...] "I never said I was frightened of dying" [...] heard halfway through [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky".|$|E

2500|$|The {{legacy that}} Cruyff gave Barcelona, however, was {{about more than}} just trophies and records, as he gave Barça a winning mentality and footballing identity/ideology that runs through the club till this day. As Barcelona manager, he laid {{systematic}} foundations for a prominent school of football: [...] "Barçajax school" [...] or [...] "Barça-Ajax school", as it has been termed by many. The predominant style of play, now known as tiki-taka or tiqui-taca, had been transferred and improved from Ajax to Barça. It was that which has sustained Barcelona since the days of Vic Buckingham, Rinus Michels and Cruyff (as player) in the early 1970s: they were the ideas of Ajax; Total Football, a predominant belief in possession-oriented football with an attack-minded 3–4–3/4–3–3 team formation, rooted in a high offside line, pressing and the interchange of players on the field. When Cruyff became Barcelona’s manager in 1988, he reinforced this footballing philosophy. He was also responsible for introducing “rondos” (a circle of players pass the ball to each other, while one in the centre tries to catch it) into the team's training sessions. About Cruyff's lasting influence on Barça's youth academy La Masia, Guillem Balagué noted, [...] "Cruyff demanded changes at the academy and La Masía began regularly producing the players he wanted as well as providing the kids with a sound education, dual ambitions of the Dutch coach and the club. “The player who has come through La Masía has something different from the rest, it's a plus that only comes from having competed in a Barcelona shirt from the <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a child,” says Guardiola. He is talking not only about the understanding of the game and their ability, but about human qualities. The players who go through La Masía are taught to behave with civility and humility. The theory being that, not only is it pleasant to be unassuming, but also if you are humble, you are capable of learning – and the capacity to learn is the capacity to improve. If you aren't capable of learning you won't improve. Since his arrival, Johan had tried and succeeded in convincing the club to train all the junior teams {{in the same way as}} the first eleven – and to favour talent over physique.” ...|$|E
