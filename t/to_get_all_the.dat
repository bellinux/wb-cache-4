25|$|The clocks at CERN and LNGS {{had to be}} in sync, and {{for this}} the {{researchers}} used high-quality GPS receivers, backed up with atomic clocks, at both places. This system timestamped both the proton pulse and the detected neutrinos to a claimed accuracy of 2.3nanoseconds. But the timestamp could not be read like a clock. At CERN, the GPS signal came only to a receiver at a central control room, and had to be routed with cables and electronics to the computer in the neutrino-beam control room which recorded the proton pulse measurement (Fig.3). The delay of this equipment was 10,085nanoseconds and this value had {{to be added to the}} time stamp. The data from the transducer arrived at the computer with a 580nanoseconds delay, and this value had to be subtracted from the time stamp. <b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> corrections right, physicists had to measure exact lengths of the cables and the latencies of the electronic devices. On the detector side, neutrinos were detected by the charge they induced, not by the light they generated, and this involved cables and electronics as part of the timing chain. Fig.4 shows the corrections applied on the OPERA detector side.|$|E
25|$|Less than a {{week after}} the assassination, President Johnson demanded in the name of {{patriotic}} duty that Warren head the governmental commission to investigate the death of John F. Kennedy. It was an unhappy experience for Warren, who did not want the assignment. As a judge, he valued candor and justice, but as a politician he recognized the need for secrecy in some matters. He insisted that the commission report should be unanimous, and so he compromised {{on a number of issues}} in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> members to sign the final version. Many conspiracy theorists have attacked the commission's findings ever since, claiming that key evidence is missing or distorted and that there are many inconsistencies in the report. The Commission concluded that the assassination was the result of a single individual, Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone. Fears of possible Soviet or Cuban foreign involvement in the assassination necessitated the establishment of a bipartisan commission that, in turn, sought to depoliticize Oswald's role by downplaying his Communist affiliations. The commission weakened its findings by not sharing the government's deepest secrets. The report's lack of candor furthered antigovernment cynicism, which in turn stimulated conspiracy theorists who propounded any number of alternative scenarios, many of which appear mutually contradictory.|$|E

Sapochnik also stated about the sequence, [...] "The main chunk of the sequence was essentially a courtroom drama and then lots of little scenes surrounding it shot in many different sets and locations and even countries so {{it took a long time}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> pieces into the editing system and start actually editing." [...] He also said that the main goal of the scene was to [...] "bring all these intersecting storylines surrounding King's Landing together and end them," [...] and that the music in the scene played an important role in reflecting how the scenes played out on screen tonally, praising Ramin Djawadi's opening score.

500|$|Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors is {{a visual}} novel {{adventure}} {{game in which}} the player assumes {{the role of a}} man named Junpei. The gameplay is divided into two types of sections: Novel and Escape. In the Novel sections, the player progresses through the storyline and converses with non-playable characters. These sections require little interaction from the player as they are spent reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of Junpei. During Novel sections, the player will sometimes be presented with decision options that affect the course of the game. The decisions made result in one of six branching storylines, each with a unique ending. The whole plot is not revealed in just one playthrough; the player needs to reach the [...] "true" [...] ending <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> information behind the mystery.

500|$|It {{was after}} the {{coronation}} of Richard that Nonant had a dispute with the monks of his cathedral chapter which led to Nonant replacing the monks with secular clergy. He {{was said to have}} commented that [...] "I call my clerks gods and the monks demons." [...] Nonant was very shrewd and eloquent, but he was also violent in his attempts to reform or expel his monastic clergy from Coventry. In October 1189 he attempted to persuade his fellow bishops who had monastic cathedral chapters to expel the monks and replace them with secular clergy. He also attempted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> bishops to prosecute a joint case at Rome to expel the monastic cathedral chapters, but gave up that idea after the Archbishop of Canterbury, Baldwin of Exeter declined to go along. Nonant did, however, receive papal sanction for the replacement of monks at Coventry. By 1197, however, Pope Celestine III issued instructions to Hubert Walter, the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Hugh of Lincoln, the Bishop of Lincoln and Samson of Tottington, the Abbot of Bury St Edmunds, to restore the monks to the cathedral.|$|E

Fire fighters were called to the scene shortly after 3:30am and spent ninety minutes fanning the blaze, which started in the bus ventilation/air-conditioning unit and caused an estimated $50,000 (€32,000) worth of damage.
