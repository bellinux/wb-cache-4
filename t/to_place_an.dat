5|$|Although coal, hydrocarbons, iron ore, platinum, copper, chromium, nickel, {{gold and}} other {{minerals}} have been found, {{they have not}} been in large enough quantities to exploit. The 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty also restricts a struggle for resources. In 1998, a compromise agreement was reached <b>to</b> <b>place</b> <b>an</b> indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary economic activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000–01 reported landing 112,934tonnes.|$|E

Two featured bouts were scheduled on the undercard, including The Undertaker versus Mr. Kennedy, in a match where the objective was <b>to</b> <b>place</b> <b>an</b> opponent in a hearse located on the entrance stage and drive {{them out of the}} arena, which Undertaker won. The other match was an Inferno match featuring wrestlers attempting to set the opponent on fire with flames surrounding the ring. Kane defeated Montel Vontavious Porter.|$|E
5|$|The Tamil remake {{rights to}} Siva were {{initially}} sold for 100,000. After the film's release, Venkat and Surendra dubbed it into Tamil as Udhayam and sold its distribution rights for 8.5 million. Released on 12 January 1990 in 24 centres, Udhayam was commercially successful and {{earned more than}} 20million. Nagarjuna's father Akkineni Nageswara Rao advised Varma <b>to</b> <b>place</b> <b>an</b> advertisement thanking the audience for the film's success. Varma opposed it, believing that a film's success should be credited to the production team and its failure attributed to the director. When Varma's second film, Kshana Kshanam (1991) under-performed at the box office, Siva success was considered accidental. In addition to the Filmfare Award for Best Film– Telugu, Siva won three Nandi Awards: Best Director (Varma), Best First Film of a Director, and Best Dialogue Writer (Bharani).|$|E

5|$|Though the Earl {{had come}} out as homosexual, on 14 September 1984 he married Francesca Fisher, then 20, the day before his 30th birthday. In sharp {{contrast}} to the Earl, Fisher was a teetotaler and a vegetarian, and he hoped she would be a calming influence on his life. He also wanted to give up drug use and homosexuality and produce an heir. His father refused to attend the wedding, going as far as <b>to</b> <b>place</b> <b>an</b> advertisement in The Times that he had a prior engagement. The marriage lasted for three years, but quickly fell apart after he started freebasing cocaine and using rent boys. During the marriage, the Earl accidentally drove a car half way over a cliff while Francesca was a passenger. They had no children. He later formed a close friendship with James Whitby, who became a companion for most of the remainder of his life.|$|E
