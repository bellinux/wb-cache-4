5|$|Accordingly, {{building}} a new oil terminal in Europe capable of handling the largest vessels that were planned was judged appropriate. The intention was that oil coming from the Middle East would be off-loaded at this <b>terminal</b> <b>and</b> then stored for trans-shipment to European refineries using smaller vessels. The closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 {{as a result of}} the Six-Day War reinforced the economic viability of this scheme. Oil shipments had to come round the Cape of Good Hope, thus avoiding the vessel size constraints previously imposed by the canal.|$|E

From that early start, Balukas completely dominated women's professional pool during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
5|$|By the 1970s {{the airport}} was again {{in need of}} {{expansion}} and modernization. In 1973 the newly created Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority (MNAA) finalized a master plan to coordinate the long-term growth of the airport along projected increases in needed passenger capacity.

5|$|Double-articulation cranes, {{which can}} load {{at a rate}} of 1,000tons per hour, {{represent}} a widely used method, and the use of shore-based gantry cranes, reaching 2,000tons per hour, is growing. A crane's discharge rate is limited by the bucket's capacity (from 6 to 40tons) and by the speed at which the crane can take a load, deposit it at the <b>terminal</b> <b>and</b> return to take the next. For modern gantry cranes, the total time of the grab-deposit-return cycle is about 50seconds.|$|E
