Ross returns home, dejected, and finds a message from Rachel on the phone. She explains her actions and decides to get off the plane, but the message cuts off. Ross panickingly tries fixing the answering machine, wondering to himself out loud if she got off the plane. From behind him, Rachel says she did. They kiss and get back together for good, both agreeing that this is where they want to be. The following morning, the friends gather in Monica and Chandler's empty apartment. With some time remaining before Monica and Chandler leave for their new house, the six all leave their keys to the apartment on <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>counter</b> and decide to go for one last cup of coffee together, to which Chandler sarcastically quips, [...] "Where?". The final scene is a shot of the apartment, panning round slowly from the living space to the front door.|$|E

50|$|In modern American and Canadian homes, {{the dining}} room is {{typically}} adjacent to the living room, being increasingly used only for formal dining with guests or on special occasions. For informal daily meals, most medium size houses and larger will have a space adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> where table and chairs can be placed, larger spaces are often known as a dinette while a smaller one is called a breakfast nook. Smaller houses and condos may have a breakfast bar instead, often of a different height than <b>the</b> regular <b>kitchen</b> <b>counter</b> (either raised for stools or lowered for chairs). If a home lacks a dinette, breakfast nook, or breakfast bar, then <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> or family room {{will be used for}} day-to-day eating.|$|R
50|$|Junger's book {{raises the}} {{possibility}} that Smith's conviction was founded on circumstantial evidence, and in part on racism, because the prosecution's narrative of Smith's day in Belmont was built on witnesses who remembered seeing Smith chiefly because he was a black man walking in a white neighborhood. Smith had cleaned the victim's house on the day in question and left a receipt (for his work) with his name on <b>the</b> victim's <b>kitchen</b> <b>counter.</b> There was no physical evidence, such as bruises or blood, linking Smith to the crime. In 1976, he was granted commutation of his life sentence; however, before his release, Smith died of lung cancer.|$|R

These scenes are seen throughout the video. When the first verse begins, the official version of Spears wearing a slip nightgown is making breakfast for her boyfriend (...) as he gets ready for work. When {{he is at the}} office, he sees a new secretary, which is actually Spears in disguise wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a pencil skirt. She starts dancing {{in front of him and}} sings the chorus. She makes him follow her into the photocopier, where she photocopies her buttocks. On the back, we see an awkward-looking man, the same who appears in the plane scene on [...] "Toxic". Then, Spears is disguised as a red-haired, tattooed waitress in a restaurant. She dances around him with her dancers and plays with him over <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>counter.</b> After this, her boyfriend is seen getting driven home by Spears, disguised as a chauffeur. She starts to kiss him, driving the car with her heel until both get home. Once they get into the bedroom, Spears reveals that she was the three women he was [...] "womanizing" [...] all along. She then begins attacking her boyfriend. This is shown through Spears as her three alter egos, and then as the real version of herself. Spears throws a blanket over her boyfriend and makes the bed. The video ends with Spears smiling, and a repeat of the opening caption.|$|E

25|$|Observant Jews {{spend the}} weeks before Passover {{in a flurry of}} {{thorough}} housecleaning, to remove every morsel of chametz from every part of the home. Jewish law requires the elimination of olive-sized or larger quantities of leavening from one's possession, but most housekeeping goes beyond this. Even <b>the</b> cracks of <b>kitchen</b> <b>counters</b> are thoroughly scrubbed, for example, to remove any traces of flour and yeast, however small. Any item or implement that has handled chametz is generally put away and not used during Passover.|$|R

5000|$|On June 18, 2013, fifteen {{pictures}} of the new house including a video tour were released. The house's theme has been called [...] "mid-century modern" [...] by Julie Chen.

Included are nods to Charles and Ray Eames, Mary Blair, the 1964 World's Fair, Pan-Am, Catch Me If You Can, and Mad Men.

A large globe hangs from the wall in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>counters</b> in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> are round instead of box shaped. The bathroom features mostly wood, and also features red rugs and pillows. Images of Los Angeles International Airport {{can be found in}} the hallway leading to the Head of Household bedroom. One of the bedrooms is architecture oriented, and featured walls decorated with blueprints and sketches. The third bedroom is filled with various colors on the walls in an abstract form.

50|$|The main {{residence}} {{consists of three}} buildings; a kitchen and office, a dining room connected to it by a covered way and a bedroom wing. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> building is set on low timber stumps with logs as bearers.

5000|$|<b>The</b> {{market and}} <b>kitchen</b> scenes showing <b>the</b> lavish produce {{available}} in Antwerp {{at the time}} have often been interpreted as showcasing the prosperity of Antwerp, the then most important trading port in the Netherlands. [...] Others see the compositions as satirical and bearing a moralistic intention. [...] Some commentators have pointed to the erotic tension between the various actors in the scenes. For instance, the composition [...] shows a cook {{standing in front of}} a fireplace, while she holds a big cabbage under her left arm and her right hand points to a chicken on a spit. A kitchen boy sitting at her feet on a bench with a dog on his lap is turning the spit. With his right hand he points to a young <b>kitchen</b> helper behind <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> maid. This young helper is placing a pot on a <b>kitchen</b> <b>counter</b> and is returning the boy's gaze. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> interior is unmistakably dominated by erotic tension between <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> boy and <b>the</b> older <b>kitchen</b> maid. <b>The</b> big dog in the lap of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> boy refers to his sexual desire while various comical and farcical foods, such as the rotisserie chicken, the cauldron of porridge, the cucumbers and the large cabbage under the arm of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> maid indicate that she is available. In [...] another popular theme of Flemish genre art is depicted: that of the unequal love between an older man and a younger woman.|$|R
