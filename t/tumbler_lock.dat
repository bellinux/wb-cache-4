25|$|The pin <b>tumbler</b> <b>lock</b> is a lock {{mechanism}} that uses pins of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key. Pin tumblers are most commonly employed in cylinder locks, but may {{also be found in}} tubular or radial locks. The earliest pin-tumble locks were made over 4,000 years ago by the Egyptians. But due to their large, cumbersome size and since they were made of wood, the locks were not practical to use. In 1848, Linus Yale, Sr. invented the modern pin-tumbler lock. In 1861, Linus Yale, Jr. was inspired by the original 1840s cylindrical lock designed by his father, thus inventing and patenting a smaller flat key with serrated edges as well as pins of varying lengths within the lock itself, the same design of the pin-tumbler lock which still remains in use today.|$|E
25|$|Until 1998, {{when it was}} {{withdrawn}} from service, the WE.177 bomb was armed with a standard tubular pin <b>tumbler</b> <b>lock</b> (as used on bicycle locks) and a standard allen key was used to set yield and burst height. Currently, British Trident missile commanders are able to launch their missiles without authorisation, whereas their American colleagues cannot. At {{the end of the}} Cold War the U.S. Fail Safe Commission recommended installing devices to prevent rogue commanders persuading their crews to launch unauthorised nuclear attacks. This was endorsed by the Nuclear Posture Review and Trident missile Coded Control Devices were fitted to all U.S. SSBNs by 1997. These devices prevented an attack until a launch code had been sent by the Chiefs of Staff on behalf of the President. The UK took a decision not to install Trident CCDs or their equivalent on the grounds that an aggressor might be able to wipe out the British chain of command before a launch order had been sent.|$|E
50|$|A wafer <b>tumbler</b> <b>lock</b> {{is a type}} of lock {{that uses}} a set of flat wafers to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. This type of lock is similar to the pin <b>tumbler</b> <b>lock</b> and works on a similar principle. However, unlike the pin <b>tumbler</b> <b>lock,</b> where each pin {{consists}} of two or more pieces, each wafer in the lock is a single piece. The wafer <b>tumbler</b> <b>lock</b> is often incorrectly referred to as a disc <b>tumbler</b> <b>lock,</b> which uses an entirely different mechanism.|$|E
50|$|By 1878, Yale Lock had {{purchased}} Shepardson's company, The United States Lock Company, {{as well as}} Felter's American Lock Manufacturing Company. For the next 35 years, production of wafer <b>tumbler</b> <b>locks</b> languished in the U. S. And while Felter and Shepardson had designed their wafer <b>tumbler</b> <b>locks</b> {{for a variety of}} applications such as drawer and desk locks as well as padlocks and door <b>locks,</b> the wafer <b>tumbler</b> <b>locks</b> made during this era were mainly used for doors in mortise locks and night-latches.|$|R

50|$|A tubular pin <b>tumbler</b> <b>lock,</b> {{also known}} as a circle pin <b>tumbler</b> <b>lock,</b> radial lock, or Ace lock after its {{original}} manufacturer, is a variety of pin <b>tumbler</b> <b>lock</b> in which a number of pins are arranged in a circular pattern, and the corresponding key is tubular or cylindrical in shape. Most locks use between six and eight pins, although some use as few as four or as many as ten.|$|E
50|$|In 1805, the {{earliest}} patent for a double-acting pin <b>tumbler</b> <b>lock</b> was granted to American physician Abraham O. Stansbury in England.

5000|$|Lock bumping is {{a recent}} trend in burglaries, which can make it easy and fast to break into homes without needing too much special {{equipment}} or leaving any trace of forced entry. It works almost as well as actually having a key, {{and a set of}} 10 rapping keys can make the criminals capable of opening 90% of common <b>tumbler</b> <b>locks</b> [...] However, criminals might choose to avoid lock bumping when stealth is required, because of the noisiness of the process. Almost all <b>tumbler</b> <b>locks</b> are vulnerable to bumping.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Double acting' lever <b>tumbler</b> <b>locks</b> {{were invented}} in 1778 by Robert Barron of England. These {{required}} the lever {{to be lifted}} to a certain height by having a slot cut in the lever, so lifting the lever too far was as bad as not lifting the lever far enough. This type of lock is still currently used today, mostly on doors in the UK and some parts of Scandinavia, but can still be found on safes or gun cabinets. In modern times, these locks have declined in popularity because pin <b>tumbler</b> <b>locks</b> have become cheaper.|$|R
50|$|Emil Christoph {{developed}} a wafer <b>tumbler</b> <b>lock</b> in 1913 which used a double-bitted key. His patent {{was assigned to}} King Lock of Chicago, a new lock manufacturer. By 1915 Briggs & Stratton Corporation was using King wafer tumbler locks in their ignition switches. In 1919, Briggs & Stratton applied for a switch patent using a wafer <b>tumbler</b> <b>lock</b> of their own design, which used a double-bitted key. Five years later, Edward N. Jacobi of Briggs & Stratton filed for a patent for a five-wafer, single-bitted wafer <b>tumbler</b> <b>lock.</b> The first recorded use of this lock was for an automobile, the 1924 Hupp Eight.|$|E

50|$|Until 2004, Kryptonite locks {{used the}} tubular pin <b>tumbler</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism. In 2005, {{after it was}} {{demonstrated}} that the tubular pin <b>tumbler</b> <b>locks</b> used on Kryptonite locks could easily be opened with the shaft of a Bic ballpoint pen of matching diameter, Kryptonite changed their locks from the tubular to a disc mechanism, preventing the use of cylindrically-shaped objects to defeat the locking system.After this problem became public, Kryptonite offered a free exchange program for all owners of locks with tubular mechanisms.Kryptonite launched a Messenger Collection in 2015, created with input from actual bicycle messengers in New York City.|$|R
50|$|Wafer <b>tumbler</b> <b>locks</b> can use single-bitted or double-bitted keys. Though wafer {{arrangements}} {{within the}} plug may vary, such as automotive locks, where the wafers {{are arranged in}} opposed sets, requiring a double-bitted key, the operating principle remains the same.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} the wafer <b>tumbler</b> <b>lock</b> in the United States is the patent in 1868 by Philo Felter. Manufactured in Cazenovia, New York, it used a flat double-bitted key. Felter's lock was patented only three years after Linus Yale, Jr. received a patent for his revolutionary pin tumbler mortise lock, {{considered to be the}} first pin <b>tumbler</b> <b>lock</b> of the modern era. That lock featured a flat steel key, referred to as a [...] "feather key" [...] because of the marked contrast with the heavy bit keys of the day. Just two years later, Hiram S. Shepardson produced a different type of wafer <b>tumbler</b> <b>lock,</b> which used a single-bitted flat steel key, similar to Yale's feather key.|$|E

50|$|Lever <b>tumbler</b> <b>locks</b> can {{be picked}} with a tool called a curtain pick which is {{inserted}} into the keyway of the lock, and a {{force is applied to}} the locking bolt.

50|$|Most wafer <b>tumbler</b> <b>locks</b> {{with low}} {{tolerances}} can be {{opened with a}} set of jigglers or try-out keys (see picture on right). These sets of keys are designed with the most common patterns of key available. The key is inserted into the lock like a normal key, and a turning force is applied whilst the key is rocked back and forth until the lock opens.|$|R
50|$|Tubular pin <b>tumbler</b> <b>locks</b> are {{generally}} considered to be safer and more resistant to picking than standard locks. This is primarily because they are often seen on coin boxes for vending machines and coin-operated machines, such as those used in a laundromat. However, the primary reason the locks are used in these applications is their lack of the depth requirement that most other locks require.|$|R
50|$|Time locks, {{combination}} locks, electronic locks, electromagnetic locks, {{and locks}} using rotating disks, such as disc <b>tumbler</b> <b>locks,</b> are inherently invulnerable to this attack, since their mechanism {{does not contain}} springs. However, some electronic locks feature a key backup that is susceptible to bumping. Warded locks are not vulnerable to bumping, but they are vulnerable to a similar attack called a skeleton key, {{which is also a}} filed-down key.|$|R
50|$|The disc <b>tumbler</b> <b>lock</b> or Abloy lock is {{composed}} of slotted rotating detainer discs. They are considered very secure and almost impossible to pick.|$|E
50|$|Disc tumbler locks are {{composed}} of slotted rotating detainer discs. A specially cut key rotates these discs like the tumblers of a safe to align the slots, allowing the sidebar to drop into the slots, thus opening the lock. Unlike a wafer <b>tumbler</b> <b>lock</b> or a pin <b>tumbler</b> <b>lock,</b> this mechanism does not use springs. Because they do not contain springs, they are better suited for areas with harsh conditions and are often used at outdoor locations like railroad and public utility installations.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} new attacks for amplifying {{rights in}} mechanical pin <b>tumbler</b> <b>locks.</b> Given {{access to a}} single master-keyed lock and its associated change key, a procedure is given that allows discovery and creation of a working master key for the system. No special skill or equipment, beyond {{a small number of}} blank keys and a metal file, is required, and the attacker need engage in no suspicious behavior at the lock's location. Countermeasures are also described that may provide limited protection under certain circumstances...|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, for cheaper locks, {{the disks}} can be {{bypassed}} by inserting a screwdriver or similar torqueing device, causing the retainer to pop {{off and the}} inside 'guts' of the lock to spill out. The same effect can be created by turning a torque tool in the lock until the end-cap pops off. After this, cheap plastic locks can be turned by hand, pulled out with pliers, or deformed by heating - causing the lock to open, or completely fall apart. More expensive disk <b>tumbler</b> <b>locks</b> use metal parts that can defeat this technique or make it more difficult.|$|R
50|$|Commonly pin <b>tumbler</b> <b>locks</b> {{are found}} in a {{cylinder}} {{that can be easily}} unscrewed by a locksmith to facilitate rekeying. The first main advantage to a cylinder lock, also known as a profile cylinder lock or euro, is that the cylinder can be changed without altering the boltwork hardware. Removing the cylinder typically requires only loosening a set screw, then sliding the cylinder from the boltwork. The second is that it is usually possible to obtain, from various lock manufacturers, cylinders in different formats that can all be used with the same type of key. This allows the user to have keyed-alike, and master-keyed systems that incorporate a wide variety of different types of lock, such as nightlatches, deadbolts and roller door locks.|$|R
