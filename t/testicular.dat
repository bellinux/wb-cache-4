5|$|Mutant Huntingtin is {{expressed}} {{throughout the body}} and associated with abnormalities in peripheral tissues that are directly caused by such expression outside the brain. These abnormalities include muscle atrophy, cardiac failure, impaired glucose tolerance, weight loss, osteoporosis, and <b>testicular</b> atrophy.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{had several}} health problems, {{including}} childhood tuberculous scrofula resulting in deep facial scarring, deafness {{in one ear}} and blindness in one eye, gout, <b>testicular</b> cancer, and a stroke in his final year that left him unable to speak; his autopsy indicated that he had pulmonary fibrosis along with cardiac failure probably due to hypertension, a condition then unknown. Johnson displayed signs consistent with several diagnoses, including depression and Tourette syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Robben did {{not make}} his {{competitive}} debut for Chelsea until November 2004, as he was injured in a pre-season friendly match against Roma, breaking a metatarsal bone in his right foot in a challenge from Olivier Dacourt. During this time, he told club doctors that he had noticed an unfamiliar growth {{on one of his}} testicles. The medical team quickly did tests to check for <b>testicular</b> cancer, but he was subsequently given the all clear.|$|E
5|$|Spaying or neutering {{increases}} life expectancy: {{one study}} found neutered male cats live {{twice as long as}} intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females. Having a cat neutered confers health benefits, because castrated males cannot develop <b>testicular</b> cancer, spayed females cannot develop uterine or ovarian cancer, and both have a reduced risk of mammary cancer.|$|E
5|$|After {{the birth}} of their daughter, her husband was {{diagnosed}} with <b>testicular</b> cancer. During this period, Ginsburg attended class and took notes for both of them, typed her husband's dictated papers and cared for their daughter and her sick husband – all while making the Harvard Law Review. They celebrated their 56th wedding anniversary on June 23, 2010. Martin Ginsburg died of complications from metastatic cancer on June 27, 2010. They spoke publicly of being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage including in a speech Martin Ginsburg wrote and had intended to give before his death that Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered posthumously.|$|E
5|$|Fleas are {{holometabolous}} insects, {{going through}} the four lifecycle stages of egg, larva, pupa, and imago (adult). In most species, neither female nor male fleas are fully mature when they first emerge but must feed on blood before they become capable of reproduction. The first blood meal triggers the maturation of the ovaries in females and {{the dissolution of the}} <b>testicular</b> plug in males, and copulation soon follows. Some species breed all year round while others synchronise their activities with their hosts' life cycles or with local environmental factors and climatic conditions. Flea populations consist of roughly 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} India, they moult their feathers from June to October. The wing moult {{begins in}} July {{with the first}} primary and proceeds towards the tenth. Secondaries are replaced from August after the primaries are at the third quill. The secondary moult is not orderly, the 8th and 7th being dropped earlier than the rest. The tail feathers are moulted centrifugally. Seasonal colour changes in the <b>testicular</b> tissues are caused by variation in melanin synthesis, with the dark pigmentation being lost during the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|New {{state laws}} prohibiting fast food {{restaurants}} in low-income neighborhoods {{result in the}} closure of all KFC eateries in Colorado, much {{to the dismay of}} Cartman, who is addicted to the food. When Randy Marsh learns that South Park's KFC outlet is now a medical marijuana dispensary, he attempts to give himself cancer so he can get a doctor's referral for marijuana after first gaining {{a clean bill of health}} from his doctor since he had assumed permits are given to the healthy. By irradiating his groin with a microwave oven, Randy successfully gives himself <b>testicular</b> cancer, making his testicles so large that he has to use a wheelbarrow to carry them. Randy obtains his medical referral and starts smoking marijuana regularly. Meanwhile, his testicles continue to grow to the point that he uses them as a space hopper for movement. Randy finds that larger testicles are attractive to women, including his wife, Sharon Marsh, so he encourages his friends to also get <b>testicular</b> cancer. The local doctor, unaware of the men's self-irradiation, becomes convinced that a recent change in South Park is responsible for the cancer outbreak.|$|E
5|$|On 20 July 2015, Ginóbili re-signed {{with the}} Spurs. On 14 January 2016, in {{a win over}} the Cleveland Cavaliers, Ginóbili played his 900th NBA game, all with the Spurs. On February 4, he {{underwent}} surgery after suffering a <b>testicular</b> injury in the Spurs' win over the New Orleans Pelicans the previous night. He was subsequently sidelined for one month. He returned to the action on March 5 after missing 12 games with the injury, scoring 22 points in 15 minutes against the Sacramento Kings.|$|E
5|$|The 2014–15 season saw Newcastle fail to win any {{of their}} first seven games, {{prompting}} fans to start a campaign to get Pardew sacked as manager before a six-game winning run in all competitions (including knocking holders Manchester City out of the League Cup) saw them climb to fifth in the table. After they ended Chelsea's unbeaten start to the season, Pardew left for Crystal Palace. On 26 January 2015, his assistant John Carver {{was put in charge}} {{for the remainder of the}} season but came close to relegation, staying up on the final day with a 2–0 home win against West Ham, with Jonás Gutiérrez, who beat <b>testicular</b> cancer earlier in the season, scoring the team's second goal.|$|E
5|$|After a {{short period}} at Wigan Athletic in 2003, he joined West Bromwich Albion, with whom he again won {{promotion}} to the Premier League. In 2006, he moved to Sheffield United, but {{much of his time}} there was spent on loan to other clubs, namely Leeds United, Leicester City and Scunthorpe United. Horsfield announced his retirement from football in 2008 after being diagnosed with <b>testicular</b> cancer, but after successful treatment he resumed his career, signing a six-month contract for Lincoln City in January 2009. In July of that year he was appointed player-assistant manager at Port Vale under Micky Adams, and the following summer he took up coaching full-time, before leaving the game completely in May 2012. In March 2013 he returned to playing football for Alvechurch.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Uribe {{signed with}} the Giants and was again used as utility player. He spent most of 2010 as the Giants' shortstop, hit a career-high 24 home runs, and had several key hits in the playoffs as the Giants won the 2010 World Series. Following that season, he signed a three-year {{contract}} with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The next two years were plagued by injuries and poor hitting, but he regained his starting role at third base and made strong contributions to the team in 2013 and 2014. Uribe {{was traded to the}} Braves in late May of the 2015 season and again to the Mets in July of the 2015 season. Before the start of spring training in 2016, he signed a one-year contract with the Cleveland Indians. He was injured by a ground ball on June 12, 2016 and was later diagnosed with a <b>testicular</b> contusion. The Indians designated him for assignment on August 1 and released him on August 5.|$|E
5|$|In case {{of failure}} with PVS, {{spermatozoa}} are sometimes collected by electroejaculation: an electrical probe is {{inserted into the}} rectum, where it triggers ejaculation. The success rate is 80–100%, but the technique requires anaesthesia and {{does not have the}} potential to be done at home that PVS has. Both PVS and electroejaculation carry a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, so drugs to prevent the condition can be given in advance and blood pressure is monitored throughout the procedures for those who are susceptible. Massage of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles is another method to retrieve stored sperm. If these methods fail to cause ejaculation or do not yield sufficient usable sperm, sperm can be surgically removed by <b>testicular</b> sperm extraction or percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration. These procedures yield sperm in 86–100% of cases, but nonsurgical treatments are preferred.|$|E
5|$|It {{has long}} been {{believed}} that a male black-throated blue warbler achieves reproductive maturation well into its first breeding season. A yearling participates in extra-pair mating and cuckoldry as much as or even more than older males. However, research by Graves has found opposing evidence in terms of <b>testicular</b> size and sperm production. Directional asymmetry is present in many passerine birds. The left testicle is often larger in size than the right one, and this holds true for both yearling and older male warblers. However, the testicle to body mass ratio nonetheless is much lower in yearlings than in older males. Moreover, older males have {{a greater degree of}} directional asymmetry than do yearlings. Because the size of testes in birds is correlated to the ejaculate quality, it is likely that females employ age-dependent choice in favor of older males who can be distinguished by their definitive age-specific plumage.|$|E
5|$|Mike Bullen {{vowed that}} he would not write a fifth series after the fourth ended so well in 2001, but was persuaded to write it when {{executive}} producer Andy Harries suggested he should kill off a character. James Nesbitt was not keen to return to do another series but Bullen persuaded him to by offering to have Adam's cancer return with fatal consequences (the character had recovered from a <b>testicular</b> cancer scare in the second series). Despite this, Bullen was unable to make Adam's death funny and, following a meeting with Harries, decided it should be Rachel who died. Harries scheduled a meeting with Helen Baxendale at the Groucho Club, where they discussed the development. The scenes where Adam talks to Rachel's spirit were inspired by Truly, Madly, Deeply and Ghost. Bullen co-wrote the script of episode three with Matt Greenhalgh.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before {{mating season}} begins, females exhibit {{swelling}} of the sex skin, which reaches its peak around {{the middle of their}} 14.8 day estrous cycle. Male sexual physiology also undergoes its own change, with <b>testicular</b> volume increasing during mating season, peaking around the time of breeding. Aggression also increases during the mating season, both between members of the same sex and by females towards the male attempting to mate with her. Females have been observed grappling, cuffing, and biting the male during copulation. Either sex may approach the other when the female is in estrus. Initially they may roar-shriek with each other. When a male approaches a female he often lowers his head and squeals, inspecting the female's genitalia by licking or sniffing, scent-marking, and offering a submissive chattering vocalization. When a female approaches a male, she may posture herself for mounting. Mating pairs often copulate many times {{during the course of a}} mating bout.|$|E
5|$|The unnamed Narrator is a {{traveling}} automobile recall specialist {{who suffers from}} insomnia. When he is unsuccessful at receiving medical assistance for it, the admonishing doctor suggests he realize his relatively small amount of suffering by visiting {{a support group for}} <b>testicular</b> cancer victims. The group assumes that he, too, is affected like they are, and he spontaneously weeps into the nurturing arms of another man, finding a freedom from the catharsis that relieves his insomnia. He decides to participate in support groups of various kinds, always allowing the groups to assume that he suffers what they do. However, he begins to notice another impostor, Marla Singer, whose presence reminds him that he is attending these groups dishonestly, and this disturbs his bliss. The two negotiate to avoid their attending the same groups, but, before going their separate ways, Marla gives him her phone number.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} the last series, Rachel returns from London and tells Adam that she aborted the baby, and their {{relationship}} seems over for good. They both start seeing other people—he one of Pete's colleagues (Rosie Cavaliero) and she a man much younger than her (Hugh Dancy)—but reconcile after Adam is diagnosed and treated for <b>testicular</b> cancer in Episode 5. David is made redundant at work and decides to be a stay-at-home dad for Josh. After some interference from Karen, he takes a new job. Their relationship improves from the first series; they spend their wedding anniversary in Paris and Karen announces in Episode 6 that she is pregnant. Pete and Jenny's marriage deteriorates when she reveals she {{had a crush on}} Adam. Pete later sleeps with a co-worker— with whom Adam was also briefly involved—and Jenny tells him {{to move out of the}} house. They decide to give their marriage another chance when Adam's cancer puts things into perspective. In Episode 6, all three couples see in the new millennium on a trip to Lindisfarne, where Pete and Jenny's relationship worsens again as the others' improve.|$|E
25|$|<b>Testicular</b> {{cancer and}} other {{neoplasms}} To improve the chances of catching possible cases of <b>testicular</b> cancer or other health issues early, regular <b>testicular</b> self-examination is recommended.|$|E
25|$|<b>Testicular</b> {{enlargement}} is an unspecific sign {{of various}} <b>testicular</b> diseases, {{and can be}} defined as a <b>testicular</b> size of more than 5 cm (long axis) x 3 cm (short axis).|$|E
25|$|Cryptorchidism, hypospadias, <b>testicular</b> {{cancer and}} poor semen quality {{make up the}} {{syndrome}} known as <b>testicular</b> dysgenesis syndrome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Testicular</b> tumors and <b>testicular</b> torsion {{are rare}} in cryptorchid cats, but {{castration}} is usually performed due to unwanted behavior such as urine spraying.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} signs of <b>testicular</b> cancer is often a lump or {{swelling}} in the testes. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine screening for <b>testicular</b> cancer in asymptomatic adolescent and adults including routine <b>testicular</b> self-exams. However, the American Cancer Society suggests that some men should examine their testicles monthly, especially if they {{have a family history of}} cancer, and the American Urological Association recommends monthly <b>testicular</b> self-examinations for all young men.|$|E
25|$|The main way <b>testicular</b> {{cancer is}} {{diagnosed}} is via a lump or mass inside a testis. More generally, if {{a young adult}} or adolescent has a single enlarged testicle, {{which may or may}} not be painful, this should give doctors reason to suspect <b>testicular</b> cancer.|$|E
25|$|A {{pregnancy}} test {{may be used}} to detect high levels of chorionic gonadotropin, however, the first sign of <b>testicular</b> cancer is usually a painless lump. Note that only about 25% of seminomas have elevated chorionic gonadotropin, so a {{pregnancy test}} is not very sensitive for making out <b>testicular</b> cancer.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>testicular</b> cancer {{occurring}} in undescended testes is seminoma. It is usually treatable if caught early, so urologists often recommend that boys who had orchiopexy as infants be taught <b>testicular</b> self-examination, to recognize <b>testicular</b> masses and seek early medical care for them. Cancer developing in an intra-abdominal testis would be unlikely to be recognized before considerable growth and spread, and {{one of the advantages of}} orchiopexy is that a mass developing in a scrotal testis is far easier to recognize than an intra-abdominal mass.|$|E
25|$|Higher {{rates of}} <b>testicular</b> cancer in Western nations {{have been linked}} to the use of cannabis. A study {{conducted}} by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and funded by the National Institutes of Health, published in the journal Cancer 15 March 2009, linked long-term use of cannabis to an increased risk for <b>testicular</b> cancer with the scientists concluding that cannabis is harmful to the human endocrine and reproductive system. In September 2012, {{a study published in the}} journal Cancer became the third to link marijuana use to the development of <b>testicular</b> cancer.|$|E
25|$|Before 1970, {{survival}} rates from <b>testicular</b> cancer were low. Since {{the introduction of}} adjuvant chemotherapy, chiefly platinum-based drugs like cisplatin and carboplatin, the outlook has improved substantially. Although 7000 to 8000 new cases of <b>testicular</b> cancer occur in the United States yearly, only 400 men are expected to die of the disease.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>testicular</b> {{germ cell}} tumors {{have too many}} chromosomes, and most often they are {{triploid}} to tetraploid. An isochromosome 12p (the short arm of chromosome 12 {{on both sides of}} the same centromere) is present in about 80% of the <b>testicular</b> cancers, and also the other cancers usually have extra material from this chromosome arm through other mechanisms of genomic amplification.|$|E
25|$|To some extent, it is {{possible}} to change <b>testicular</b> size. Short of direct injury or subjecting them to adverse conditions, e.g., higher temperature than they are normally accustomed to, they can be shrunk by competing against their intrinsic hormonal function through the use of externally administered steroidal hormones. Steroids taken for muscle enhancement (especially anabolic steroids) often have the undesired side effect of <b>testicular</b> shrinkage.|$|E
25|$|Cisplatin is {{particularly}} effective against <b>testicular</b> cancer; the cure rate was improved from 10% to 85%.|$|E
25|$|In boys, <b>testicular</b> {{enlargement}} is {{the first}} physical manifestation of puberty (and is termed gonadarche). Testes in prepubertal boys change little in size from about 1 year of age to the onset of puberty, averaging about 2–3cm in length and about 1.5–2cm in width. The size of the testicles is among {{the parameters of the}} Tanner scale for male genitals, from stage I which represents a volume of less than 1.5 ml, to stage V which represents a <b>testicular</b> volume of greater than 20 ml. <b>Testicular</b> size reaches maximal adult size about 6 years after the onset of puberty. After the boy's testicles have enlarged and developed for about one year, the length and then the breadth of the shaft of the penis will increase and the glans penis and corpora cavernosa will also start to enlarge to adult proportions. While 18–20cm3 is an average adult size, there is wide variation in <b>testicular</b> size in the normal population.|$|E
25|$|<b>Testicular</b> {{cancer is}} cancer that {{develops}} in the testicles, {{a part of}} the male reproductive system.|$|E
