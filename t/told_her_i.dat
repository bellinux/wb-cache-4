500|$|After {{returning}} to London, Mills asked Karmal to marry her. Karmal said yes, but on one condition: [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> couldn't marry {{her until she}} did something about her compulsive lying, and she agreed to see a psychiatrist for eight weeks. She admitted she had a problem {{and said it was}} because she'd been forced to lie as a child by her father". Although Mills proposed to Karmal, she later said that every man she has been out with [...] "has asked me to marry him within a week". The couple married on 6 May 1989. While married to Karmal, she suffered two ectopic pregnancies, so Karmal paid for her to go on holiday to Croatia with his children and ex-wife (with whom Mills had become friends) in 1990, but Mills ended up living with her ski instructor, Miloš Pogačar, shortly before the Croatian War began. Mills set up a refugee crisis centre in London, helping over 20 people to escape the war. She drove to deliver donations to Croatia, taking modelling assignments in Austria on the way to pay for the trip, later saying that she [...] "worked on the front line in a war zone in the former Yugoslavia for two years where there were mines everywhere that weren't marked". Karmal and Mills were divorced in 1991 and Mills was later engaged to Raffaele Mincione (a bond dealer for the Industrial Bank of Japan) in 1993.|$|E
500|$|David Hill, 18, {{was asked}} to [...] "sit in" [...] at the house, and while there heard Dudson shout [...] "Shut up, you slag!" [...] in the back room. When he asked what was going on, Leigh had shown him Capper. He said: [...] "She {{had a sort of}} cloth over her face, from just above the eyebrows and {{covering}} her nose. She had a bit of dried blood on her lip. She had no hair." [...] Hill also said he had heard them talking about [...] "dentistry work. It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She asked me if I could help but I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. She asked me if I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. I was too shocked to do anything." [...] While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiance Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: [...] "They could have told me there and then. The door would have been kicked down and I would have got Suzanne out. I did not think they were capable of such savagery. Now all I want is ten minutes with them in a back room." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the role}} of the evil Asa and her {{innocent}} descendant Katia, Bava noted: [...] "A strange type was needed, and we chose Steele from pictures." [...] Bava reportedly found Steele difficult to work with. According to Bava, the actress [...] "was somewhat irrational, afraid of Italians. One day she refused to come to the set, because somebody <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> was using a special film-stock that made people appear naked." [...] Steele recalled: [...] "Lord alone knows I was difficult enough. I didn't like my fangs – I had them changed three times. I loathed my wig – I changed that four times. I couldn't understand Italian. I certainly didn't want to allow them to tear open my dress and expose my breasts, so they got a double that I didn't like at all, so I ended up doing it myself – drunk, barely over eighteen, embarrassed and not very easy to be around." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>'er</b> <b>I</b> {{was coming}} {{straight}} away to drownd myself," [...] pursued Mr. Heard. [...] "My last words to 'er was, 'When {{you see my}} bloated corpse you'll be sorry.'" ...|$|R
60|$|EILEEN. No, that didn't {{amount to}} anything. She seemed mad because <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> so little. <b>I</b> think she guessed <b>I</b> only <b>told</b> <b>her</b> what <b>I</b> did so she'd {{let me stay}} up, maybe--your last day,--and {{to keep her from}} {{thinking}} what she did--about us.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{as we went}} on to {{the corner}} together, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> why <b>I</b> did it, and {{recalled}} the car-ride.|$|R
2500|$|On {{her fifth}} album, Ciara {{contributed to both}} the writing and {{production}} of the album's songs. She wrote [...] "Sweat" [...] (featuring 2 Chainz), a song that was originally {{supposed to be the}} album's first single when the album was called One Woman Army. Ciara also co-wrote and co-produced [...] "Sorry", the song that was chosen to supersede [...] "Sweat" [...] as one of One Woman Armys two lead singles, along with [...] "Got Me Good", also written by Ciara. None of these records made the final album. [...] "Sorry" [...] was co-written and co-produced by Jasper Cameron, who previously worked with Ciara on her 2006 single [...] "Promise" [...] and 2009 single [...] "Never Ever". Together the duo wrote and produced [...] "Super Turnt Up" [...] which did make the final listing for Ciara. [...] "Got Me Good" [...] was co-written with Rodney Jerkins and Livvi Franc (Olivia Waith). When interviewed by Rap-Up TV, Jerkins said [...] "I had a meeting with her about what her future holds and I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> was there if she ever needed my creative juices, so hopefully me and her get in the studio and work." [...] Jerkins previously produced records for [...] and Fantasy Ride.|$|E
2500|$|After {{playing a}} piano riff and singing the melody for Jimmy Jam, they {{recorded}} a rough vocal track. Jam stated, [...] "She sang me the melody, {{and then asked}} [...] "well, {{what do you think}} it needs?" [...] I said, Nothing. Go write some lyrics, it's fine," [...] adding, [...] "She had a bunch of different melodies, so we picked the two melodies that worked best." [...] Jam and Lewis chose to forego its production, deciding another producer should execute the song: [...] "We stay away from things we can't do. It's not like, 'We've got to do this, and it's got to be our way.' We're going for the best way." [...] Jam contacted Jellybean Johnson to develop the song with Jackson and help her produce it. Johnson recalled, [...] "She first played the groove for me on piano... I thought it would be cool if I could make Janet sound like a heavy metal queen. I knew the rest of them thought I was out of my mind, but I got a friend to play the guitars. I put toms and cymbals on it. Terry played bass and some sparse keyboards, and it was there." [...] In addition to Johnson, guitarist Dave Barry was asked to contribute after previously providing guitar on [...] "You Can Be Mine" [...] from Jackson's prior album. Barry stated, [...] "I wanted it to be authentic rock and roll. I rocked it out, then Janet and I got together to do the vocals. Janet is a very nice, warm person, and she was receptive to my ideas." [...] Jackson sang the song in an alternate tone, quickly adjusting her vocals in a single take. Johnson described, [...] "One night I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> wanted her to sound like a rock and roll queen on it–she usually uses one of her other voices [...]. this, you wanted to be funky, but more rocked out. She did it in one or two takes." [...] Jam added, [...] "I tried to get her to sing a couple of the other vocals in her natural [...] with kind of an edge on it; she [...] didn't like the way her voice sounded, but for Black Cat, that was exactly what was needed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> {{was out of}} a job," [...] said Corley. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> was in Pim's. She doesn't know my name. I was too hairy to {{tell her}} that. But she thinks I'm a bit of class, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|Rectus couldn't; but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> {{understood}} the language tolerably well, {{and asked her}} why she wished to know.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{there was}} ... Florence. You know, Aunt Emmy, {{we were always}} {{intimate}} friends until last year. Then Florence once told Rose Watson something <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> in confidence. <b>I</b> found it out and I was so hurt. I couldn't forgive Florence, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> plainly <b>I</b> could never be a real friend to her again. Florence felt badly, because she really did love me, and {{she asked me to}} forgive her, but it seemed as if I couldn't. Well, Aunt Emmy, that was my Christmas gift to <b>her</b> ... my forgiveness. <b>I</b> went down last night and just put my arms around <b>her</b> and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> loved <b>her</b> as much as ever and wanted to be real close friends again.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> thanked <b>her</b> and accepted. She {{was curious}} {{to hear about}} Asquith and its people, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all <b>I</b> knew.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps, if you haven't {{tried to}} make her, you have tried to prevent her. Haven't you <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> am unsuccessful, I am poor?' ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> {{was ready}} to explain my self, if she would give me her Word, she would not resent it, and would take nothing ill.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{mother gave}} me the lunch," [...] said Horace Kelsey, as he handed the basket to Ralph. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> was coming down to see you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother {{took the}} oranges {{out of the}} knapsack, and then I pulled it up again. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> had plenty more for myself.|$|R
60|$|I {{called to}} Euphemia and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> {{had found the}} old tavern sign. She came to look at it, and I pulled it out.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hardly remember. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> what <b>I</b> {{thought would}} please her. I've been in Florence a week. I hoped {{you would come}} to see me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So do I, {{but not so}} much as I {{thought at}} that time, and--oh, surely that is not Rachel Curtis? I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> thought you would call." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> {{had met her}} on Saturday last, {{had been}} so {{fortunate}} as to render her a trifling service, and was come now on the young lady's invitation.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Kilcullen. [...] "I have bid {{her good}} bye. But give her my kindest love, {{and tell her}} that I did what I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> would do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} <b>told</b> <b>her</b> who <b>I</b> am after all, or {{found out the}} {{particulars}} of Ambrose's history,' she murmured. 'But her being in love alters everything.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> as <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> Major Fitz-David, that I {{had reason}} to think Mr. Dexter's advice might be of real {{assistance}} to me at starting.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> {{loved you}} {{in spite of}} myself, and would make you my wife {{in the face of}} all opposition. Now, Jean, your answer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Mrs. Somers!' she whispers, {{her eyes}} poppin'. 'Are you crazy?' An' I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> shore wasn't crazy an' I shore was sober. An' thet my name wasn't Moran, but Somers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Grandfather, {{this letter}} is from my aunt. She wishes me to go and live with her and prepare for the stage. I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> wished to do so. I am going." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I met {{the owner}} in Rome last winter. It {{belongs to a}} Mrs. Craddock, and when I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> was looking out for a house, she {{suggested}} that I should come and see this.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't help it, George! Don't you be popping your ugly head {{so close}} to my ears, Gumbo! After what has passed between us, I am bound in honour to stand by her. If she sees no objection, I must find none. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that Madam would be very rusty at first; but {{that she was very}} fond of me, and must end by relenting. And when you come to the property, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> knew my dearest George so well, that I might count upon sharing with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> what <b>I</b> had seen, {{and while}} I spoke {{she put on}} <b>her</b> bonnet, and <b>I</b> exulted, thinking--and then she took off <b>her</b> bonnet, and <b>I</b> knew she would not go away with me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I only <b>told</b> <b>her</b> what <b>I</b> hoped," [...] he said quietly. [...] "That is all I dared {{say even}} to myself. But I {{want you to}} listen to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; {{no doubt}} you will too. I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> should come to you, {{and she did not}} object. I think she was glad to be saved {{broaching}} the subject, for she is half ashamed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Missis Gummidge,' he returned, 'not {{being a good}} scholar, sir, Ham kindly drawed it out, and {{she made}} a copy on it. They <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> was gone to seek her, and what my parting words was.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} she doesn't think that I {{care much about}} it. When I <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> did it all of a heap, you see; and I fancy she thought I was just mad at the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is {{not expecting}} me, as it happens," [...] Draconmeyer lied smoothly. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> might be dining at the Villa Mimosa. I {{have to be}} there later on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My sister," [...] she answered. [...] "It {{was to try}} {{and save}} <b>her</b> life that <b>I</b> wanted the money. When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> could not get it, she gave up and died. Your uncle killed her. Come." ...|$|R
