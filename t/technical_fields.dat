5|$|Georgia Tech's {{undergraduate}} and graduate programs are divided into six colleges. Collaboration among the colleges is frequent, as mandated {{by a number of}} interdisciplinary degree programs and research centers. Georgia Tech has sought to strengthen its {{undergraduate and}} graduate offerings in less <b>technical</b> <b>fields,</b> primarily those under the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts. That particular College has seen a 20% increase in admissions. Also, even in the Ivan Allen College, the Institute does not offer a Bachelor of Arts degree, only a Bachelor of Science.|$|E
5|$|An {{emigrant}} {{from his}} native Belgium, he arrived in the New York area in 1897 and dabbled in several <b>technical</b> <b>fields</b> before hitting upon instant coffee manufacture during a sojourn in Central America in 1906 or 1907. He began selling his coffee in 1909 and founded a company to manufacture it in 1910. Based in New York and New Jersey, his company prospered and became an important military supplier during World War I. The company's products were also advertised in New York newspapers and on the radio. The success of his company made Washington wealthy, and {{he lived in a}} mansion in Brooklyn and then moved to a country estate in New Jersey in 1927. In that same year, he lost a dispute with the tax authorities. Washington was married and had three children.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} for Times Higher Education, Jack Harris says that Walker is an {{extremely}} good writer and even {{those who do not}} specialise in <b>technical</b> <b>fields</b> will derive enjoyment from the book. According to Harris, Walker has unique experience as historian to the NRC which has placed him in an unrivalled position to tell the TMI story. But Harris identifies some omissions in the book. There is little on the other two major nuclear that threatened large civilian populations: the Windscale fire (UK, October 1957), and the Chernobyl disaster (Ukraine, April 1986). Harris states that Windscale threw up similar problems to TMI, particularly relating to whether large-scale evacuations should have been initiated, but he could find no reference to the Windscale accident in the book's index which is surprising in a book that aims to put TMI in historical perspective.|$|E

5|$|The Southern Technical Institute (STI) was {{established}} in 1948 in barracks {{on the campus of}} Naval Air Station Atlanta (now DeKalb Peachtree Airport) in Chamblee, northeast of Atlanta. At that time, all colleges in Georgia were considered extensions of the state's four research universities, and the Southern Technical Institute belonged to Georgia Tech. STI {{was established}} as an engineering technology school, to help military personnel returning from World War II gain hands-on experience in <b>technical</b> <b>fields.</b> Around 1958, the school moved to Marietta, to land donated by Dobbins Air Force Base. STI was split from Georgia Tech in 1981, {{at a time when most}} other regional schools separated from the University of Georgia, Georgia State University, and Georgia Southern University.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus Tech {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{technical}} colleges in Denmark, teaching undergraduate study programmes in English, including vocational education and training (VET), continuing vocational training (CVT), and human resource development. Business Academy Aarhus is among the largest business academies in Denmark and offers undergraduate and some academic degrees, in IT, business and <b>technical</b> <b>fields.</b> The academic level technical aspects are covered in a collaboration with Aarhus Tech, Aarhus School of Marine and Technical Engineering and Aarhus Educational Centre for Agriculture. The Danish School of Media and Journalism (DMJX) is the oldest and largest of the colleges, offering journalism courses since 1946, with approximately 1,700 students as of 2014. DMJX has been an independent institution since 1974, conducting research and teaching at undergraduate level, and in 2004, master's courses in journalism was established in a collaboration with Aarhus University. The latter is offered through the Centre for University studies in Journalism, granting degrees through the university.|$|E
5|$|Post-independence, {{there was}} growing black resentment towards the Asian {{domination}} of the small business sector. Kenyatta's government put pressure on these Asian-owned businesses, intending to replace them with African-owned counterparts. In 1965, the government established the Kenya National Trading Corporation to ensure indigenous control over the trade in essential commodities, while the Trade Licensing Act of 1967 prohibited non-citizens from involvement in the rice, sugar, and maize trade. During the 1970s, this was expanded to cover the trade in soap, cement, and textiles. Many Asians had retained their British citizenship rather than taking on Kenyan citizenship and were affected by these measures, with their work permits not being renewed. The government established the Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation to provide loans for black-owned businesses, and secured a 51% share in the Kenya National Assurance Company. It also passed laws to encourage foreign investment, recognising that Kenya needed foreign-trained specialists in scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>fields</b> to aid its economic development. Under Kenyatta, Western companies regarded Kenya as a safe and profitable place for investment.|$|E

25|$|In several <b>technical</b> <b>fields,</b> in particular, {{computer}} science, mathematics, engineering, and physics, TeX {{has become}} a de facto standard. Many thousands of books have been published using TeX, including books published by Addison-Wesley, Cambridge University Press, Elsevier, Oxford University Press and Springer. Numerous journals in these fields are produced using TeX or LaTeX, allowing authors to submit their raw manuscript written in TeX. While many publications in other fields, including dictionaries and legal publications, have been produced using TeX, {{it has not been}} as successful as in more <b>technical</b> <b>fields,</b> because TeX was primarily designed for mathematics. When he designed TeX, Donald Knuth did not believe that a single typesetting system would fit everyone's needs; instead, he designed many hooks inside the program so that {{it would be possible to}} write extensions, and released the source code, hoping that publishers would design versions tailored to their needs. While such extensions have been created (including some by Knuth himself), most people have extended TeX only using macros and it has remained a system associated with technical typesetting.|$|E

In automobile repair, an ignition analyzer is used to show the spark waveforms for each cylinder. All of these are essentially oscilloscopes, performing the basic task of showing the changes in one or more input signals over time in an X‑Y display.|$|E
25|$|The {{governorate}} of Muscat comprises six wilayats: Muttrah, Bawshar, Seeb, Al Amrat, Muscat and Qurayyat. Of the wilayats, Seeb, {{located in}} the western section of the governorate, was the most populous (with over 220,000 residents), while Muttrah had {{the highest number of}} expatriates (with over 100,000). Approximately 71% of the population was within the 15–64 age group, with the average Omani age being 23 years. About 10% of the population is illiterate, an improvement when compared to the 18% illiteracy rate recorded during the 1993 census. Expatriates accounted for over 60% of the labour force, dominated by males, who accounted for 80% of the city's total labour. A majority of expatriates (34%) engineering-related occupations, while most Omanis worked in engineering, clerical, scientific or <b>technical</b> <b>fields.</b> The defense sector was the largest employer for Omanis, while construction, wholesale and retail trade employed the largest number of expatriates.|$|E

25|$|The {{household}} income levels of American Muslims {{are about as}} evenly distributed as the general American population. Among South Asians in the country, the large Pakistani American community stands out as particularly well educated and prosperous, with education and income levels exceeding those of U.S.-born whites. Many are professionals, especially in medicine (they account for 2.7-5% of America’s physicians), scientists, engineers, and financial analysts, {{and there are also}} a large number of entrepreneurs. There are more than 15,000 medical doctors practicing medicine in the USA who are of Pakistani origin alone and the number of Pakistani American millionaires was reported to be in the thousands. Shahid Khan a Pakistani-born American multi billionaire businessmen owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL) making him the first and only ethnic minority member to own one, he also owns English Premier League team Fulham F.C., and automobile parts manufacturer Flex-N-Gate in Urbana, Illinois. 45 percent of immigrant Muslims report annual {{household income}} levels of $50,000 or higher. This compares to the national average of 44 percent. Immigrant Muslims are well represented among higher-income earners, with 19 percent having annual household incomes of $100,000 or higher (compared to 16 percent for the Muslim population as a whole and 17 percent for the U.S. average). This is likely due to the strong concentration of Muslims in professional, managerial, and <b>technical</b> <b>fields,</b> especially in information technology, education, medicine, law, and the corporate world.|$|E
500|$|Carson {{attempted}} {{to leave the}} Bureau (by then transformed into the Fish and Wildlife Service) in 1945, but few jobs for naturalists were available as most money for science was focused on <b>technical</b> <b>fields</b> {{in the wake of}} the Manhattan Project.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} a statistical theory for estimating {{the rate of}} development of a <b>technical</b> <b>field.</b> The patent activity in the <b>technical</b> <b>field</b> is determined and used as a criterion of development in this field. The paper comprises three sections: 1. 1. Formation of basic statistical ideas about the creation and materialization of an invention. Finding an appropriate mathematical expression of these ideas. 2. 2. Derivation of numerical methods enabling {{the solution of the}} statistical problem stipulated in the first section. 3. 3. Testing of the created theory through several examples of a patent activity in the world. In first section it is shown {{that it is possible to}} find an analogy between the methods of statistical mechanics and the methods of statistical mechanics and the methods describing the process of inventing. The theory is created using these analogy- based axioms and enables the creation of a great numer of models by which the process of inventing can be controlled. In the third section the theory is tested through the example of the patent activity in the <b>technical</b> <b>field</b> chamber X-ray apparatus supplied by a current of frequency considerably higher than from the mains in the F. R. G., U. S. A and U. S. S. R. The simplest model already {{provides a}} very good agreement between the number of patent applications actually deposited and the theoretical results and enables the prognosis of the patent activity and in this way also the estimation of the future development in a <b>technical</b> <b>field.</b> On the other hand the sensitivity of the method upon the correct selection of patent applications into the fields is shown. The theory may be used as an effective help in deciding about license investments, in regulation of research works, for production of <b>technical</b> <b>field</b> development prognosis and in many problems relating to economics in which a knowledge of supposed development of the <b>technical</b> <b>field</b> is important. ...|$|R
