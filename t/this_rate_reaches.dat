Haemophilia B plasma was obtained from untreated patients with different levels of FIX deficiency and from severe haemophilia B patient treated with FIX concentrate (Ahemphil B) during its clearance with half-life t 1 / 2 = 12 hours. As reported previously (Ataullakhanov et al. Biochim Biophys Acta 1998; 1425 : 453 - 468), clot growth in space showed two distinct phases: activation and propagation. The activation phase is characterized by the time required to start clot growth from the activator, while the characteristic parameter of the propagation phase is the clot elongation rate. <b>This</b> <b>rate</b> <b>reaches</b> steady state in approximately ten minutes after the beginning of growth.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the association of}} motor and cognitive/learning deficiencies and overall disabilities in very preterm (VPT) children and their relations to gestational age (GA) and brain lesions. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: EPIPAGE is a longitudinal population-based cohort study of children born before 33 weeks' gestation (WG) in 9 French regions in 1997 - 1998. Cumulating data from all follow up stages, neurodevelopmental outcomes were available for 90 % of the 2480 VPT survivors at 8 years. Main outcomes were association of motor and cognitive deficiencies and existence {{of at least one}} deficiency (motor, cognitive, behavioral/psychiatric, epileptic, visual, and/or hearing deficiencies) in three GA groups (24 - 26, 27 - 28, and 29 - 32 WG) and four groups of brain lesions (none, minor, moderate, or severe). RESULTS: VPT had high rates of motor (14 %) and cognitive (31 %) deficiencies. Only 6 % had an isolated motor deficiency, 23 % an isolated cognitive one and 8 % both types. <b>This</b> <b>rate</b> <b>reached</b> 20 % among extremely preterm. Psychiatric disorders and epilepsy were observed in 6 % and 2 % of children, respectively. The risks of at least one severe or moderate deficiency were 11 and 29 %. These risks increased as GA decreased; only 36 % of children born extremely preterm had no reported deficiency. Among children with major white matter injury (WMI), deficiency <b>rates</b> <b>reached</b> 71 % at 24 - 26 WG, 88 % at 27 - 28 WG, and 80 % at 29 - 32 WG; more than 40 % had associated motor and cognitive deficiencies. By contrast, isolated cognitive deficiency was the most frequent problem among children without major lesions. CONCLUSIONS: In VPT, the lower the GA, the higher the neurodisability rate. Cerebral palsy is common. Impaired cognitive development is more frequent. Its occurrence in case without WMI or early motor disorders makes long-term follow up necessary. The strong association between motor impairments, when they exist, and later cognitive dysfunction supports the hypothesis of a common origin of these difficulties...|$|R

Axial displacement and radial deformation are considered as two major types of mechanical defects in this study.

This technique is called Frequency Response Analysis (FRA). Thereafter, some features based on cross-correlation and other mathematical patterns are selected from the obtained signals. These features are then used to train an ANN classifier. The proposed method is able to discriminate between radial deformation and axial displacement defects precisely and determine the axial displacement extent and radial deformation location with a good accuracy. <b>This</b> accuracy <b>rate</b> <b>reaches</b> 81. 25 � 0 for axial displacement extent and 75 � 0 for radial deformation location...|$|R

All nymphs put in the containers placed in the sun died rapidly, while a high moulting rate (94 %) was observed in containers placed in the shade. <b>This</b> <b>rate</b> <b>reached</b> 63 % for the ticks released in the cages. The moulting period lasted from less than 4 to more than 6 weeks, depending on the release period: unfed adults are therefore present in the pasture 4 - 5 months before the onset of the adult infestation period. The {{survival rate}} of the unfed adults did not vary according to the release period of the nymphs: at the beginning of the rainy season, 20 - 25 % of the adult ticks were still alive in the cages. Very important variations in survival and disappearance rates were observed according to the place where the cages had been installed: within a few metres, the survival rate could vary from 0 to 90 %, presumably because of the activity of predators which removed also dead tick from the plastic containers. Predators may then have a great but highly variable and unpredictable impact on the natural population of A. variegatum adults. Engorged nymphs released on pasture were able to find suitable micro-habitats allowing survival, covered up to 2. 8 metres to reach them, and grouped together at the neck or root network of bushes and grass clumps, sometimes burrowing to a depth of 10 cm.

For a thick condensed layer it is found that 1 keV Ar+ ions sputter the condensed layer with a yield of 160 XeF 2 molecules per ion for 1 keV Ar+ ions and 280 for 2 keV ions. For thinner layers (below 9 nm for 1 keV ions), <b>this</b> sputter <b>rate</b> by ions decreases significantly.

This evaluation {{is accomplished by}} direct sputum smear &amp; sputum culture. These examinations must be done in regular and preferably monthly after beginning of treatment. These tests have two important aims, including, determining of treatment efficacy &amp; duration of isolation. "nMethods and Materials: Most of the studies have that classic six month regimen led to sputum smear conversion &amp; negative sputum culture in 85 % of patient. This treatment regimen has two phases, including, attack phase and maintenance phase. In the attack phase we use four drugs, including, Isoniazid (INH), Rifampin (RMP), Pyrazinamide (PZA) and Ethambutol (EMB) for the first 2 months and if necessary {{until the end of}} third month. In the maintenance phase we use INH and Rif for the remaining of treatment course. The main objectives of this study were to determine the time needed for smear conversion and assessment of probable factors which may influence the smear conversion until 4 months after beginning of therapy. The factors that were assessed, were, Age, nationality, sex, clinical symptoms, underlying diseases, chest radiography (number of cavities), smoking, drug abuse and concentration of AF 13 in the sputum Generally, we did this cross sectional study on the patient's records, who had been observed in Imam Khomeni Hospital, west health service center and masih daneshvary hospital between.

For example, between 1976 and 2008, African Americans were victims of 329,825 homicides. Although {{there is a widespread}} perception that war is the most dangerous form of armed violence in the world, the average person living in a conflict-affected country had a risk of dying violently in the conflict of about 2.0 per 100,000 population between 2004 and 2007. This can be compared to the average world homicide rate of 7.6 per 100,000 people. This illustration highlights the value of accounting for all forms of armed violence rather than an exclusive focus on conflict related violence. Certainly, there are huge variations in the risk of dying from armed conflict at the national and subnational level, and the risk of dying violently in a conflict in specific countries remains extremely high.

We further studied the efficacy of this approach by using the 9 L rat gliosarcoma model, and cells producing 5 x 10 (3), 9 x 10 (4), 3 x 10 (5) HSV-tk retroviral particles per milliliter. Their stereotactic injection in 9 L brain tumors and GCV treatment did not result in any increase of survival. To study a model of optimal in vivo transduction, we examined the survival of rats with tumors growing from 9 L cells that had been previously transduced in vitro with the HSV-tk vectors (9 LTk cells). We observed that GCV administration cured 26 % (n = 42) of the animals with 9 LTk brain tumors, with most of the relapsing tumors remaining HSV-tk positive. The increase of either the dose or the duration of GCV treatment did not improve the survival rate. But the cerebral localization of the tumor played an important role, because <b>this</b> survival <b>rate</b> <b>reached</b> 67 % (n = 12) when similar tumors were growing subcutaneously. No or only marginal antitumoral responses were induced by the presence of a selectable marker gene in the HSV-tk vectors.
