But he preferred <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>calm</b> as {{he does not want}} to hurt his father. Subramaniam realises his mistake and apologises to everyone saying that he always wanted to take care of his family members so well but had never thought that they are sacrificing a lot to make him happy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of January, 1894 a meeting of the Central Committee of the Fasci took place in Palermo to discuss the {{position}} of the movement. Two sharply contrasting positions emerged. De Felice Giuffrida, known for his anarchist tendencies, supported the need {{to take advantage of the}} situation of unrest to provoke a revolution on the island. However, the majority took an opposite view, arguing the need to proceed peacefully. A revolt was not only inappropriate, but it would be detrimental to the movement. The meeting condemned the violent incidents in various parts of the island, and launched an appeal <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>calm</b> and not to retaliate. In the end De Felice Giuffrida accepted the position of the majority. But the die was cast for the authorities to arrest De Felice, Montalto, Petrina, and others. Garibaldi Bosco, Barbato and Verro were arrested on board the steamship Bagnara that was about to leave for Tunis.|$|E

He was pleased with the result, saying it was [...] "a very special win" [...] and that he felt he was close to the form he had achieved in 2005: [...] "I tried hard <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>calm.</b> And I'm not the best at it sometimes. We all know that." [...] He added, [...] "We do this to win. Winning these races is the greatest. Winning a championship would be the ultimate. What we’re trying to do is win the championship this year. That’s our number-one goal.” Second-place finisher Earnhardt was disappointed, saying he had his car in his chosen position but the red-flag period prevented him from winning the race: [...] "Carl wasn't going to get beat today. He had it in the bag. He was so strong... I was terrible on cold tires. I wish all of you knew what that felt like. I hate it." [...] Biffle was philosophical as he argued that he had the fastest car but did not gain the track position he needed to challenge Edwards because he slid on pit road.|$|E

Empty spaces are thought to be unplanned areas, which is better to avoid in order <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> secure, <b>calm</b> and peaceful.

2500|$|According <b>to</b> Gildas, Aurelianus <b>stayed</b> <b>calm</b> {{despite the}} fact that his parents had been killed in the attacks and became leader of the {{remaining}} British, organised them, and led them in their first victory against the Saxons, although subsequent battles went both ways. Gildas also writes that Aurelianus's parents [...] "wore the purple", and thus were apparently descended from Roman emperors. The Aurelii were a noted Roman senatorial family and it is possible that Ambrosius was descended from them. Owing to a possible mistranslation of a word from Gildas, describing Aurelianus as either the [...] "ancestor" [...] or the [...] "grandfather" [...] of his descendants of Gildas's generation, it is possible that Aurelianus lived in the generation before the Battle of Badon. According to the Major Chronicle Annals, he rose to power in 479.|$|R

50|$|Green-winged teal inhabit inland lakes, marshes, ponds, pools, {{and shallow}} streams with dense {{emergent}} and aquatic vegetation. They prefer shallow waters and small ponds and pools during the breeding season. Green-winged teal are often found resting on mudbanks or stumps, or perching on low limbs of dead trees. These ducks nest in depressions on dry ground {{located at the}} base of shrubs, under a log, or in dense grass. The nests are usually 2 to 300 ft from water. Green-winged teal avoid treeless or brushless habitats. Green-winged teal winter in both freshwater or brackish marshes, ponds, streams, and estuaries.

40|$|Here {{are some}} tips <b>to</b> help you <b>stay</b> <b>calm</b> during exams, {{so that you can}} reach your potential. 1. Start to prepare for your exams well in advance. Try to keep up with your uni work on a day to day basis if you can. Avoid relying on last minute cramming {{in the days leading up}} to an exam. 2. Put the exam in perspective. It is only an exam. The result is not a {{reflection}} of who you are as a person. If you invest too much of your self-worth in studying and exams it can create additional stress and anxiety. 3. Get a good night’s sleep beforehand. It’s important that you feel rested on the day of the exam. Even 4 - 5 hours may be enough. It’s hard to produce your best work in the exam if you are feeling exhausted. 4. Eat sensibly before the exam. Some people overeat when they are feeling anxious, while others stop eating at all. Eating a nutritious meal can help you feel physically comfortable and stay alert and focused for your exam...|$|R
5000|$|Ebert's first {{action as}} {{chancellor}} was {{to issue a}} series of proclamations asking the people <b>to</b> remain <b>calm,</b> <b>stay</b> out of the streets and to restore peace and order. It failed to work. Ebert then had lunch with Scheidemann at the Reichstag and, when asked to do so, refused {{to speak to the}} masses gathered outside. Scheidemann however seized upon the opportunity, and in hopes of forestalling whatever the Communist leader Karl Liebknecht was telling his followers at the now-former royal palace, proclaimed Germany a republic. A furious Ebert promptly reproached him: [...] "You have no right to proclaim the Republic!" [...] By this he meant that the decision was to be left to an elected national assembly, even if that decision might be the restoration of the monarchy. Later that day, Ebert even asked Prince Maximilian <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> on as regent, but was refused.|$|R

5000|$|For their {{demographic}} {{the main}} point was the choice to avoid foreign conflicts. The new [...] "Steppe Lords" [...] were relatively peaceful while the Tang dynasty was later greatly weakened by the An-Shi rebellion of 755-763 providing a new intra-China situation with a weak center and with provincial generals pacification and strengthening of their respective provinces. In this context the Khitans and their close-relatives the Xi had opposite strategies. Kumo Xi kept a relatively aggressive foreign policy slowly exhausting their forces. The Khitans chose <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> as a <b>calm</b> self-defensive power enjoying most of the Manchurian plain and working to improve their daily situation. While previous centuries had seen successive Turko-Chinese provocations or recall to obeisance, and the following wars had prevented Khitan gaining any notable expansion, the 8th-century situation eventually allowed one. This demographic growth would strongly support the other qualitative changes.|$|R
