40|$|This is {{an essay}} {{concerning}} {{the density of}} the city. An increasing amount of today’s cities have a shortage of space available for the erection of new buildings and settlements, especially in areas close to the city-centre. New buildings and settlements are therefore often found in the outskirts of the city, resulting in long distances between work and living for many people. These long distances are a waste of limited resources and are inconsistent with the vision of the sustainable city. The challenge for the future is to insert new buildings and settlements in the existing city-structure and in this way reduce the distances between different city-functions. The density of the city can be increased in two different ways; by inserting new buildings between existing ones or by extension existing buildings, for example by an additional floor. The subject of this essay is to examine the latter way of increasing the city’s density, that is through extensions of existing buildings by building on rooftops, so called “vertical concentration”. <b>Vertical</b> <b>concentration</b> lacks tradition in Sweden, but is quite common on the European continent, especially in the Netherlands. This essay therefore aims to examine <b>the</b> conditions for <b>vertical</b> <b>concentration</b> to be applied in the city-planning of Sweden, with the city of Norrköping as a case-study. A circumstance which has greatly simplified <b>the</b> implementation of <b>vertical</b> <b>concentration</b> in Sweden came with the introduction of a new regulation concerning “three-dimensional property formation” in 2004. For example, this regulation enables a floor in a building to become a property of its own, separated from the rest of <b>the</b> building. <b>Vertical</b> <b>concentration</b> gives new opportunities to obtain a mix between spaces for living and working in the same building. For instance it enables a floor of apartments to be put on top of a building consisting of offices. An important aspect to keep in mind when applying <b>vertical</b> <b>concentration</b> is to avoid an impoverishment of city-functions, for example by adding a floor of apartments on top of a dwelling complex. An analysis was carried out of Norrköping and its buildings in order to investigate the town’s suitability for <b>vertical</b> <b>concentration.</b> For a building to be used for <b>vertical</b> <b>concentration</b> it had to pass a number of restrictions formulated in different rules and regulations concerning city-planning.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the distribution and mineralogy of radioactive Cs in a core sample from reservoir sediment affected by the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident.

X-ray diffraction analyses of the size-fractionated sample revealed that the contribution of clay minerals (14 Å minerals, kaolin mineral and mica) increased concomitantly with the decrease of particle size, implying a close relation between radioactive Cs concentration and clay mineralogical compositions. Periodical airborne monitoring showed that the 137 Cs inventory in the reservoir catchment area decreased significantly with time after the accident. Results of a 137 Cs inventory in the reservoir sediment were almost identical to those for the catchment area immediately after the accident, but {{were significantly higher than}} those in the core sampling period.

40|$|A laser-induced {{fluorescence}} (LIF) {{technique is}} described to measure two-dimensional <b>vertical</b> <b>concentration</b> profiles of {{gases in the}} aqueous mass boundary layer at a free water surface. The technique uses an acid-base reaction of the fluorescence indicator fluorescein at the water surface to visualize the concentration profiles. It is shown that this technique is capable of measuring <b>the</b> two-dimensional <b>vertical</b> <b>concentration</b> profiles {{at a rate of}} 200 frames per second with a spatial resolution of 20 µm. The results show that the decrease of the measured mean concentration profiles into the bulk is faster than predicted by the small eddy model. The measurements agree with the predictions of the surface renewal model. Combined experiments with a wave slope imaging technique reveal that there is no local correlation between wave slope and boundary layer thickness. The image sequences indicate that there is only a weak correlation between the occurrence of surface renewal phenomena and steep wave trains. Surface renewal effects for a fully developed wave field renew the fluid in the aqueous mass boundary layer up to the water surface. This is not true for the case of a flat interface. Here, the changes of the boundary layer thickness after a surface renewal event are significantly smaller...|$|R
