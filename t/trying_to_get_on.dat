25|$|In Jersey, {{where the}} school {{children}} were on two weeks holiday {{to help with}} the potato harvest, everyone who wished to leave was asked to register, queues quickly appeared, with 23,000 eventually registering. The civil service could not cope and scared of potential riots with desperate people <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> ships, announcements that it was best to stay in the island resulted in only about 1,000 Jersey children being evacuated with their parents and 67 teachers.|$|E
25|$|AOL charged {{its users}} an hourly fee until December 1996, {{when the company}} changed to a flat monthly rate of $19.95. During this time, AOL {{connections}} would be flooded with users <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on,</b> and many canceled their accounts due to constant busy signals. A commercial featuring Steve Case telling people AOL was working day and night {{to fix the problem}} was made. Within three years, AOL's user base grew to 10 million people. In 1995 AOL was headquartered at 8619 Westwood Center Drive in the Tysons Corner CDP in unincorporated Fairfax County, Virginia, near the Town of Vienna.|$|E
25|$|Other common {{causes of}} death {{included}} hypothermia, drowning in river crossings, getting run over by wagons, and accidental gun deaths. Later, more family groups started traveling, and many more bridges and ferries were being put in, so fording a dangerous river became much less common and dangerous. Surprisingly few people were taught to swim in this era. Being run over was {{a major cause of}} death, despite the wagons' only averaging 2–3 miles per hour. The wagons could not easily be stopped, and people, particularly children, were often <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> and off the wagons while they were moving—not always successfully. Another hazard was a dress getting caught in the wheels and pulling the person under. Accidental shootings declined significantly after Fort Laramie, as people became more familiar with their weapons and often just left them in their wagons. Carrying around a ten-pound rifle all day soon became tedious and usually unnecessary, as the perceived Indian threat faded and hunting opportunities receded.|$|E

500|$|According to the artist, {{the songs}} on the Truth Serum EP talk about her most intense failed relationship. Following the {{narrative}} of the EP, Lo indicated that the track talks about the part when the relationship is over and she is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> with her life in [...] "not the healthiest way". The recording was also included in [...] "The Pain" [...] section of Lo's debut studio album, Queen of the Clouds, a concept album that describes {{the pattern of the}} singer's relationships.|$|E
500|$|Luce {{refused to}} take any action to save himself—he had told Baalham, before the second officer's departure, that [...] "the fate of the ship shall be mine". When {{he could no longer}} render {{assistance}} to those still on board, he climbed with his young son to his command post atop the starboard paddle box, and waited for the end. By this time, many on board had become resigned to their fate; they huddled together for comfort while some sang hymns or recited scripture. A few still frantically sought for means of survival; those who could not find a place on the raft lashed together anything that might float—chairs, stools, caskets, sofas and doors, while Holland continued to fire the cannon. Peter McCabe, a waiter on his first transatlantic voyage, later described the scene: [...] "Several persons were floating about on doors and beds... I seized hold of a door which had been taken down to save passengers, and went into the sea, where I left the door and got upon the raft... A great many persons were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the raft... Among the number who were on it I saw four ladies". Many were lost from the raft when it fouled the sinking hull—a section broke off, spilling its occupants into the sea. After this, McCabe counted seventy-two men and four women either on or clinging to the structure, as it moved slowly away from the ship.|$|E
2500|$|Kelly {{later said}} of the album, [...] "I was heavily under the {{influence}} of Sandinista!, the Clash album, at the time. Sandinista! has this kind of 3D thing on it, which I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> record, but it was my first effort at production so it didn't turn out that great." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the draft, Quinn {{was criticized}} by fellow Notre Dame quarterback Joe Theismann {{in a radio}} interview, {{claiming}} that Quinn looked [...] "unprofessional" [...] {{when he was on}} stage following his name being called. Theismann was bothered by the appearance of Quinn's hair {{and the fact that he}} was chewing gum. Quinn responded, saying, [...] "I apologize to anyone, obviously, who is a Notre Dame alum, or for those fans who thought I wasn't being very business like. I was there for awhile, and at that moment in time, when you finally get picked after waiting for 4 1/2 hours, the last thought in my head was spit out your gum, fix your hair or make sure your shirt and everything looked good. I was just <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> stage as fast as possible and get that Browns jersey in my hand." ...|$|E
