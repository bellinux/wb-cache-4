5|$|In 2004, four {{female athletes}} – Anette Sagen, Helena Olsson Smeby, Line Jahr, and Lindsey Van – {{were invited to}} perform test jumps prior to the men's 2004 Continental Cup event in Vikersund. However, this was {{initially}} blocked by Torbjørn Yggeseth, founder of the Ski Jumping World Cup {{and a member of}} the FIS technical committee at the time, on the grounds that it was too dangerous to allow women on ski flying hills. Sagen challenged this and eventually won the right <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>from</b> the hill, along with her fellow athletes. Both Sagen and Smeby jumped , which remains the third longest distance for women.|$|E
5|$|Rathbone {{jumped from}} his seat and {{struggled}} with Booth, who dropped the pistol and drew a knife, then stabbed Rathbone in the left forearm.

As he began crossing the stage, many in the audience thought {{he was part of}} the play.|$|E

Separate footage of the rig exploding—created by {{combining}} actual shots of the rig with CGI—was then filmed, and the two shots were composited on top of one another.|$|E

5|$|C-17s {{have also}} {{supported}} ADF training. In this role they have moved helicopters {{and other equipment}} between Australian bases, and supported training deployments to the United States. In April 2010, members of the Australian Army's No. 176 (Air Dispatch) Squadron became the first paratroopers <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>from</b> a non-American Globemaster; the type was first used to support training by the Army's Parachute Training School in June that year. A C-17 transported an Army M1 Abrams tank {{for the first time}} during a training exercise conducted on 11 May 2012. To mark the arrival of the RAAF's final Globemaster, four of the aircraft flew over Brisbane together on 22 November 2012. Each of the C-17s involved in the flight carried a different type of cargo to showcase the type's capabilities; A41-211 was configured for aeromedical evacuation tasks, another C-17 embarked an Abrams tank, one carried two Tiger helicopters and the fourth was loaded with several Bushmasters.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{took his}} fifth win {{of the season}} when he crossed {{the line at the}} end of the 56th lap, almost 15seconds ahead of the second-placed Massa. Räikkönen took third ahead of Alonso. Heidfeld managed <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>from</b> ninth on the grid to finish in fifth place, just ahead of his {{teammate}} Kubica, who climbed from eleventh on the grid. A one-stop pit strategy worked well for Glock as he finished seventh; Piquet took eighth. Vettel, Coulthard, Barrichello and Nakajima took the next four places; Bourdais recovered from his early contact with Trulli to take 13th. Webber's initial success with a two-stop strategy faded as he finished 14th. Rosberg took 15th, ahead of Button and Fisichella. Trulli, Sutil and Kovalainen were the three retirements from the 56lap race.|$|E
5|$|Many of Royal Oaks crew who {{had managed}} <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>from</b> the sinking ship {{were dressed in}} little more than their nightclothes and were {{unprepared}} for the chilling water. A thick layer of fuel oil coated the surface, filling men's lungs and stomachs and hampering their efforts to swim. Of those who attempted the half-mile (800 m) swim to the nearest shore, only a handful survived. Gatt switched the lights of Daisy 2 on and he and his crew managed to pull 386 men from the water, including Royal Oaks commander, Captain William Benn. The rescue efforts continued for another {{two and a half hours}} until nearly 4:00am, when Gatt abandoned the search for more survivors and took those he had to Pegasus. Although aided by boats from Pegasus and the harbour, he was responsible for rescuing almost all the survivors, an act for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the only military award made by the British in connection with the disaster.|$|E
