5|$|In the episode, newly wedded companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) {{are trapped}} on a {{crashing}} space liner {{which has been}} caught in a strange cloud belt. <b>They</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> Doctor (Matt Smith), who lands on the planet below and meets the miserly Kazran Sardick (Michael Gambon), {{a man who can}} control the cloud layer but refuses to help.

5|$|Raëlism (also {{known as}} Raëlianism or the Raëlian movement) is a UFO {{religion}} that {{was founded in}} 1974 by Claude Vorilhon (b. 1946), now known as Raël. The Raëlian Movement teaches that life on Earth was scientifically created by a species of extraterrestrials, which <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> Elohim. Members of this species appeared human when having personal contacts with {{the descendants of the}} humans that they made. They purposefully misinformed early humanity that they were angels, cherubim, or gods. Raëlians believe that messengers, or prophets, of the Elohim include Buddha, Jesus, and others who informed humans of each era. The founder of Raëlism received the final message of the Elohim and that its purpose is to inform the world about Elohim and that if humans become aware and peaceful enough, they wish to be welcomed by them.|$|E
5|$|The 10th-century Persian {{geographer}} Ibn al-Faqih {{wrote of}} a local legend related {{by the people of}} Lajjun regarding the source of the abundant spring used as the town's primary water source over the ages: there is just outside al-Lajjun a large stone of round form, over which is built a dome, which <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> Mosque of Abraham. A copious stream of water flows from under the stone and it is reported that Abraham struck the stone with his staff, and there immediately flowed from it water enough to suffice for the supply {{of the people of the}} town, and also to water their lands. The spring continues to flow down to the present day.|$|E
5|$|Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) {{find out}} that Dave was {{planning}} on marrying Linda; however, as the two were an interracial couple, they gained an enemy in Eric Singleton (Alexander Cendese), who stole the engagement ring out of the couple’s car, but after they were dead. Megan later finds residue in Linda's eyes {{to suggest that the}} killer closed her eyes after she died, which leads them back to Linda's parents, who knew that Dave intended to propose. When <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> two into the office, Al admits he killed Dave and Linda. He had only wanted to scare them so they would not marry; however, the gun discharged, killing Linda, and in panic, he killed Dave too. After apologizing to Laura, Al is taken away. Throughout the day, Megan tries to reconnect with her daughter Lacey (Mary Mouser); however, her attempts to create a better relationship with her backfire.|$|E

25|$|On maps {{a united}} realm, Inkarra {{is rife with}} kings great and small who {{constantly}} scheme for power and place. The greatest is the Storm King Zandaros, both the High King of Inkarra and perhaps the mightiest human Air Wizard. As High King, all other kings of Inkarra must pay tribute to Zandaros. The Inkarrans despise the Rofehavanish, who <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> Dayborn, considering them to be utter barbarians.|$|E
25|$|The Daleks {{also appear}} in Lego Dimensions where they ally {{themselves}} with Lord Vortech and possess the size-altering scale keystone. When Batman, Gandalf, and Wyldstyle encounter them, {{they assume that}} they are allies of the Doctor and attack the trio. The main characters continue to fight the Daleks until <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> Doctor to save them. A Dalek saucer also appears in the level based on Metropolis, in which {{the top of it}} serves as the stage for the boss battle against Sauron and includes Daleks among the various enemies summoned to attack the player. A Dalek is also among the elements summoned by the player to deal with the obstacles in the Portal 2 story level.|$|E
25|$|Several {{decades later}} the Klingons {{encountered}} a race <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> Kinshaya, {{on the side}} of their empire opposite to the Federation. This led to a period of total war which nearly resulted in the destruction of the Klingons by the Kinshaya. The war lasted for five years and ended in a stalemate with continuing skirmishes. Unable to expand in this direction, the Klingons started a war of expansion against the Federation, called The Four Years War. It ended in a humiliating loss by the Klingons, and they conceded territory to the Federation. After a decade of rebuilding, another effort at expansion into the Federation was halted when the Klingons encountered the Organians (as seen in the original series episode Errand of Mercy).|$|E

25|$|Leto Atreides, {{on hearing}} {{news of this}} assignment, realizes {{that there must be}} a trap, but the {{opportunity}} is too valuable to decline. He arranges his trusted advisors, including Swordmaster Duncan Idaho, Mentat Thufir Hawat, Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, and troubadour-soldier Gurney Halleck, to prepare for any eventuality. Meanwhile, Reverend Mother Mohiam accuses Leto's concubine, the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica, of defying their secret centuries-long breeding program, aimed to produce a male Bene Gesserit <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> Kwisatz Haderach who would have mental powers to see throughout time and space. Jessica had been ordered to produce a daughter to continue the program, but out of love for Leto she had given him a son, Paul Atreides. Jessica has since trained Paul in the Bene Gesserit ways, and Mohiam is reluctantly impressed by the boy.|$|E
25|$|Quakers {{traditionally}} use {{numbers to}} denominate {{the names of}} the months and days of the week, something <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> plain calendar. This does not use names of calendar units derived from the names of pagan deities. The days begin with First Day (Sunday) and ends on Seventh Day (Saturday), and months run from First Month (January) to Twelfth Month (December). This is based on the terms used in the Bible: e.g., Jesus Christ's followers went to the tomb early on the First Day of the week. The plain calendar emerged in the 17th century in England in the Puritan movement, but became closely identified with Friends {{by the end of the}} 1650s, and was commonly employed into the 20th century. It is less commonly encountered today. The term First Day School is commonly used, for what is called by most churches Sunday School.|$|E
25|$|Anderson {{suggested}} that <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> new band Life while Squire {{suggested that}} it be called World. After renaming themselves Yes! at Banks' suggestion, the first gig under the new brand followed at a youth camp in East Mersea, Essex on 4 August 1968. Early sets were formed of cover songs from artists such as the Beatles, the 5th Dimension and Traffic. On 16 September, Yes performed at Blaise's club in London {{as a substitute for}} Sly and the Family Stone, who failed to turn up. They were well received by the audience, including the host Roy Flynn, who became the band's manager that night. That month, Bruford decided to quit performing to study at the University of Leeds. His replacement, Tony O'Reilly of the Koobas, struggled to perform {{with the rest of the}} group on-stage. After Bruford was refused a year's sabbatical leave from Leeds, Anderson and Squire convinced him to return for Yes's supporting slot for Cream's farewell concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 26 November.|$|E

25|$|Yaroslavna {{is alone}} {{worrying}} about why {{she has not}} heard from Igor and his companions (Yaroslavna's Arioso). She sings of her tearful nights and nightmares and reminisces about when she was happy with Igor by her side. The nurse brings in the young women who tell Yaroslavna of their abducted friend. They are reluctant at first to reveal the culprit but eventually name Galitsky and talk of {{how he and his}} drunken followers cause trouble around Putivl. Galitsky enters and the women run away. Yaroslavna questions him as to the truth of their story and he mocks her saying she should treat him as a guest in her house. She threatens him with what Igor will do on his return, but Galitsky replies that he can seize the throne whenever he wants. Yaroslavna accuses him of repeating the betrayal that he carried out against their father, but he replies that he was only joking and asks if she has a lover now her husband is away. She threatens him with sending him back to their father. He replies that he will return the girl but will take another later and leaves. The council of boyars arrive to inform Yaroslavna that the Polovtsy under Khan Gzak are about to attack Putivl. Igor's army has been utterly destroyed and he has been wounded and captured with his son and brother. After a moment of faintness, Yaroslavna orders messengers sent to the city's allies, but the Boyars report that the roads are cut, some towns are in revolt and their princes will be captured. The Boyars say that they will organise the defence but Galitsky returns with his followers to demand that a new Prince be chosen. His retinue say it should be him as he is Yaroslavna's brother and Igor's brother-in-law. The boyars refuse. The argument is interrupted by the sight of flames and the sound of crying women. Some of the boyars flee; some join the battle, others guard the Princess. <b>They</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> attack God's judgment.|$|E
500|$|Some {{contemporary}} Jews in the United States {{choose not}} to circumcise their sons. They are assisted by {{a small number of}} Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis, and have developed a welcoming ceremony that <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> brit shalom ("Covenant [...] Peace") for such children, also accepted by Humanistic Judaism.|$|E
500|$|Although a few Christian {{denominations}} {{follow the}} Judaic practice of observing the Sabbath on Saturday, Catholics, {{along with most}} Christians, observe Sunday as a special day, which <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Lord's Day". This practice dates to the first century, arising from their belief that Jesus rose from the dead {{on the first day}} of the week. The Didache calls on Christians to come together on the Lord's Day to break bread and give thanks. Tertullian is the first to mention Sunday rest: ...|$|E
