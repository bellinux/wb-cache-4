40|$|This paper {{uses the}} British Household Panel Survey (1991 - 2008) and the UK Census (waves 1991, 2001 and 2011) {{to examine the}} {{association}} between gentrification and displacement in English cities. Gentrification is the phenomena of a large and relatively sudden in-migration of wealthy or middle class residents into a previously poor or working class neighbourhood. I measure this using the change in share of neighbourhood population that holds a degree certificate conditional on the initial share. The effect is found to depend crucially on household income and homeownership status {{as well as how}} gentrified the initial share. In a ward with an initial degree share of 5 %, a renter household with an income of 0. 5 times <b>travel-to-work-area</b> (TTWA) median is found to be 1. 5 percentage points more likely to exit for each percentage point increase in degree share, after controlling for other factors. However, if the household income is 1. 5 times the TTWA average then this effect becomes statistically insignificant. For homeowners, on the other hand, the effect remains stable at around 1 pp across all income levels. This result may be explained by institutional context since, in the UK, property tax is only applied at the point of sale. This means that a low-income homeowner facing increasing property value is not forced to sell due to escalating tax assessments, as may be the case in the US. So whilst the rising housing costs associated with gentrification do induce homeowners to sell, there is no income dimension to this effect as there is with rising rental costs. These results provide a significant contribution to the literature on displacement, which has previously found little evidence for the effect...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary and {{incomplete}} (Do not cite) The drop in transactions in UK housing markets which followed the 2007 / 2008 credit crunch was concentrated in relatively cheaper housing. I document this happened within most major UK housing markets by ana-lyzing {{the distribution of}} traded homes using location, dwelling type and repeat-sales data for the universe of housing transactions for English and Welsh <b>travel-to-work-areas.</b> I propose an explanation based on the changes in loan-to-value ratios in the mortgage market {{which took place in}} mid- 2008. The results stress how changes in down-payment constraints affect tenure choice, entry into and moves along the British housing ladder...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} local human capital on individuals’ wages through external effects. Employing wage regressions, {{it is found that}} changes in individuals’ wages are positively associated with changes in the shares of high-paid occupation workers in the British <b>travel-to-work-areas</b> for the late 1990 s. I examine this positive association for different occupational groups (defined by pay) in order to disentangle between production function and consumer demand driven theoretical explanations. The wage effect is found to be stronger and significant for the bottom-paid occupational quintile compared to the middle-paid ones, and using also sectoral controls the paper argues to provide evidence for the existence of consumer demand effects.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I review {{aggregate}} spatial trends in employment in health care. This is a neglected {{area in the}} study of employment change. Although much attention has been given recently to the producer services sector, in numerical terms the health-care sector is a major employer and, locally, can provide a substantial proportion of jobs within individual labour markets. I first consider regional trends in health-care employment over time, and then disaggregate these, where possible, by grade of staff. The contribution of health care to total employment is then examined for standard regions and also for <b>travel-to-work-areas</b> (TTWAs). Possible interpretations of these changes are then discussed. Four interrelated factors are implicated: the impact of the public expenditure policies of successive governments; the effect of policies designed to redistribute resources in the NHS; local decisions on the siting and closing of NHS hospitals; and the impact of private sector growth in health care. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} mismatch unemployment in two local labour markets in Scotland. A total of seven possible sources of such unemployment are identified and examined {{within the context of}} a predominantly urban area and a mixed urban-rural area. These are contiguous <b>travel-to-work-areas</b> (TTWAs). The paper attempts to identify what causes recruitment difficulties and discusses the extent to which the problem is demand-induced. A survey of employer practices and attitudes is followed up by multiple regression analysis to determine the effect of these practices on vacancy duration. The analysis shows that there are certain recruitment practices and inherent characteristics of employers which result in job offers that are either unattractive or inaccessible to the unemployed. It is argued that design of policy for implementation at the local level needs to take account more explicitly of the demand side of the local labour market than has so far been evident in the UK approach to the skill mismatch issue...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the wage effects arising from changing local human {{capital in the}} labour market areas of Britain. Employing wage regressions, {{it is found that}} individuals' wages are positively associated with changes in the employment shares of high-paid occupation workers in the British <b>travel-to-work-areas</b> for the late 1990 s. I examine this positive association for different occupational groups (defined by pay) in order to disentangle between production function and consumer demand driven theoretical justifications. The former refer to production complementarities or wider productivity spillovers arising in areas with high shares of high-skill workers. According to the latter, the presence of a high income workforce in the economy boosts the demand for consumer services leading to an increase in low-pay, service related employment. As these services are non-traded, the increased demand for local low-paid services should be reflected in a wage premium for the relevant low-paid occupation employees in the areas with larger shares of high-paid workers. The wage impact is found to be stronger and significant for the bottom occupational quintile compared to the middle-occupational quintiles and using also sectoral controls the paper argues to provide some preliminary evidence for the existence of consumer demand effects. The empirical investigation addresses potential sources of biases controlling for time invariant unobserved area-specific characteristics and unobserved individual characteristics. Nevertheless, the paper points to a number of caveats of the analysis that warrant future research. local labour markets, wages, consumer demand, human capital externalities...|$|R
