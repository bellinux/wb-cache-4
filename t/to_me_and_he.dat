500|$|In a Playboy {{interview}} with David Sheff {{shortly before his}} death, Lennon said, [...] "Sean was a planned child, {{and therein lies the}} difference. I don't love Julian any less as a child. He's still my son, whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didn't have pills in those days. He's here, he belongs <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> always will." [...] He said he was trying to re-establish a connection with the then 17-year-old, and confidently predicted, [...] "Julian and I will have a relationship in the future."

2500|$|... {{this movie}} is about visuals. It's about excitement, it's about thrills. Don't worry about the script... I {{remember}} mentioning it to six or seven people that the script was trashy and I always got the same answer... The script doesn't matter. This movie is about visuals... Then {{we go to the}} first edit, the first cut of the movie in the screening room and it's [...] Iovine and me and Joel Silver... And about 20 minutes into the movie Jimmy turns <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> goes... {{this movie is}} really shitty isn't it? It's really bad. I said, yeah, it's a really bad script. Why didn't anyone notice that the script was bad? It stinks. I can't even watch it... Joel's on the other side going, what am I gonna do next? There's gotta be a next project, and they're sitting there and there's so many lessons I learned during that movie. It went $14 million over budget, I think and I kept saying to Joel, how are they allowing this? 'Cause they kept screaming at us, it's over the budget. I said, how, and they, you've gotta understand, they built all, Walter Hill didn't want to go to Chicago. The story took place in Chicago, so they built Chicago in LA.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout series three (2007), {{companion}} Martha Jones pines for the Doctor's affection {{ever since}} a kiss between them {{which was only}} used as a [...] "genetic transfer" [...] to distract their pursuers. She is distraught when, temporarily turned into a human in [...] "Human Nature", the Doctor's human persona John Smith, {{falls in love with}} nurse Joan Redfern.
