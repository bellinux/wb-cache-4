5|$|In a four-part series {{published}} between April and August 1995, Brock {{returns to}} New York City in prusuit of supervillain Carnage after learning about Carnage Unleashed, {{a video game}} based on Carnage's rampage in Maximum Carnage (1993). Carnage discovers a method of transporting his symbiote through phone lines, which he uses to hack computers and attack people playing the game. He escapes from the Ravencroft asylum and kidnaps his caregiver, Dr. Pazzo. Venom confronts Carnage in cyberspace, before Pazzo douses Carnage in flammable liquid and sets him ablaze. Venom saves Carnage from dying, reasoning <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>is</b> what he wants. A subplot has Brock meeting Kirstin, a young musician. When Brock accidentally paralyzes her boyfriend Clive, Kirstin asks her mother to avenge him; this storyline continues in Venom: Sinner Takes All.|$|E
5|$|Several weeks later, Kevin tells Wendy of his {{research}} about the explosion of Flight 180 and the subsequent deaths of the survivors, believing that the survivors of Devil's Flight are in a similar situation. Thinking that Kevin is deriding her, Wendy dismisses his theory and leaves. Ashley and Ashlyn are later killed in a tanning salon when their tanning beds short circuit. Then, a shelf falls, trapping them inside, and the girls are burned alive. Now convinced <b>that</b> <b>Death</b> <b>is</b> after them, seeking to kill those who escaped Devil's Flight in sequence, Wendy and Kevin set out to save the remaining survivors using omens hidden in photos taken by Wendy {{on the night of}} the roller coaster's derailment.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceremony}} is often held weeks, months, or {{years after the}} death so that the deceased's family can raise the significant funds needed to cover funeral expenses. Torajans traditionally believe <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>is</b> not a sudden, abrupt event, but a gradual process toward Puya (the land of souls, or afterlife). During the waiting period, {{the body of the}} deceased is wrapped in several layers of cloth and kept under the tongkonan. The soul of the deceased is thought to linger around the village until the funeral {{ceremony is}} completed, after which it begins its journey to Puya.|$|E

25|$|Death was {{historically}} {{believed to}} be an event that coincided {{with the onset of}} clinical death. It is now understood <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>is</b> a series of physical events, not a single one, and determination of permanent death is dependent on other factors beyond simple cessation of breathing and heartbeat.|$|E
25|$|Nigamananda {{said that}} one should {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>is</b> coming. Before working on good or evil deeds one should also remember <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>is</b> not far off. Contemplating death drives away the desire for sensual pleasure and evil thoughts and stops acts of injustice. Attachment to wealth and relations will then diminish. Earthly matters remain even after departure from this world. Only spiritual wealth remains as an asset to the individual. Those who have puffed with pride on account of their accomplishments will submit to the God of death meekly when that hour comes. Drunk with pride, some persons ill-treat their brethren. They will {{be left in the}} deserted crematory ground with the beasts and birds joyously waiting to feast upon their flesh. Thinking of this will drive evil thoughts from the mind.|$|E
25|$|As the {{manuscript}} {{comes to a}} close, Chris explains that he is soon going to be reborn and will forget all that has happened. He ends with a message of hope, telling his readers <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>is</b> not to be feared, and that he knows {{that in the future}} he and Ann will ultimately be reunited in Heaven, even if in different form.|$|E

25|$|Ultimately {{paralysis}} {{becomes so}} severe that an animal is unable to stand or even lift its head. The breathing becomes slow, exaggerated and gasping. A foul odor on the breath can signal aspiration pneumonia. Although pain is not regarded as being a feature of tick paralysis animals {{would appear to be}} in severe distress. Finally, the mucous membranes develop a bluish hue (cyanosis) and a state of coma indicates <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>is</b> imminent.|$|E
25|$|The opening quatrain {{begins with}} the {{personification}} of time, a destroyer of great things built by man, a force man cannot equal. The second quatrain portrays a victorless struggle between {{the sea and the}} land. In the last quatrain the speaker applies these lessons to his own situation, realizing <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>is</b> inevitable and time will come and take his love away. The concluding couplet, in contrast to Shakespeare's typical practice, provides no solution, no clever twist; only inevitable tears.|$|E
25|$|Catholics {{say that}} Santa Muerte is an idol, {{the worship of}} which has been {{rejected}} by God in the Old Testament. Veneration of this or any other idol can be a form of inadvertent devil-worship, because regardless of the intent of the worshipers; the devil can trick people into doing such things. Priests regularly chastise parishioners, telling them <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>is</b> not a person but rather a phase of life. However, the Church stops short of labeling such followers as heretics, instead accusing them of heterodoxy.|$|E

25|$|Other objects {{associated}} with Santa Muerte include scales, an hourglass, an owl, and an oil lamp. The scales allude to equity, justice, and impartiality, {{as well as}} divine will. An hourglass indicates the time of life on earth and also the belief <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>is</b> not the end, as the hourglass can be inverted to start over. The hourglass denotes Santa Muerte's relationship with {{time as well as}} with the worlds above and below. It also symbolizes patience. An owl symbolizes her ability to navigate the darkness and her wisdom. The owl is also said to act as a messenger. A lamp symbolizes intelligence and spirit, to light the way through the darkness of ignorance and doubt.|$|E
25|$|The {{countess of}} Bedford wrote “Elegy on Mistress Boulstred” in {{response}} to Donne’s first elegy that characterized Death as a gluttonous monster. In the poem, she refers to Donne’s Holy Sonnet 10, which starts with the famous line, “Death be not proud.” Russell argues that Donne’s interpretation of Death was more accurate in this Holy Sonnet instead of in his elegy. She says <b>that</b> <b>Death</b> <b>is</b> something {{that should not be}} proud, and that Donne’s elegy gave Death too much credit. As a Christian, Boulstred went to Heaven when she died, and Donne did not give Boulstred enough credit when he characterized her as a helpless victim of Death in his elegy. After this criticism, Donne wrote his second elegy for Boulstred, focusing on Boulstred’s virtues instead of on Death.|$|E
25|$|The Buddha also {{asserted}} that karma influences rebirth, {{and that the}} cycles of repeated births and deaths are endless. Before the birth of Buddha, ancient Indian scholars had developed competing theories of afterlife, including the materialistic school such as Charvaka, which posited <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>is</b> the end, there is no afterlife, no soul, no rebirth, no karma, and they described death to be a state where a living being is completely annihilated, dissolved. Buddha rejected this theory, adopted the alternate existing theories on rebirth, criticizing the materialistic schools that denied rebirth and karma, states Damien Keown. Such beliefs are inappropriate and dangerous, stated Buddha, because such annihilationism views encourage moral irresponsibility and material hedonism; he tied moral responsibility to rebirth.|$|E
5000|$|In early May 2013, {{after an}} {{investigation}} of Ziegel's death, Peoria County Coroner Johnna Ingersoll said <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>was</b> caused by alcohol and drug intoxication, not by the fall. The analysis showed that Ziegel had a blood alcohol level of [...]123 and a level of morphine indicating the presence of heroin was 540 ng/ml. None of these values are lethal in themselves. The cause of death, according to Ingersoll, was {{the combination of these}} substances. Coroner's jury acknowledged <b>that</b> Ziegel's <b>death</b> <b>was</b> accidental.|$|R
50|$|Another {{independent}} autopsy {{was conducted}} in June of 2016 by Dr. Adel Shaker, a former medical examiner in Alabama and Mississippi. Shaker also concluded <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>was</b> caused by positional asphyxia, suffocation from being restrained in a prone position.|$|R
50|$|Liverseege's {{career was}} now {{beginning}} to take off and his work was selling well for decent prices. His health, however, rapidly declined {{towards the end of}} 1831 and by the beginning of 1832 he realised <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>was</b> near.|$|R
25|$|John Donne {{was under}} the matronage of Lucy Russell {{during the time that}} Boulstred fell ill and died. As {{previously}} mentioned, he visited her when she was sick and concluded that she was suffering from hysteria. After she died, he wrote two poems in her honor, “Elegy on Mistress Boulstred” and “Elegy Upon the Death of Mistress Boulstred.” The former poem characterizes Death as an “all-consuming glutton who swallows the good” and argues that Boulstred was one of the good ones. The latter poem says <b>that</b> <b>Death</b> <b>is</b> no longer needed because Boulstred was the epitome of virtue, and now that she is dead, it is like the entire world is dead. Donne most likely wrote these elegies in the hopes of getting a reward from his literary matron Lucy Russell.|$|E
25|$|The Faceless Men {{believe that}} all the slave {{population}} of Valyria prayed for deliverance to the same god of death, in different incarnations. In Qohor, the Many-Faced God is called the Black Goat of Qohor; in Yi Ti, the Lion of Night and in the Faith of the Seven, the Stranger. This belief of a single god with many incarnations or 'faces' came to {{be reflected in the}} Guild's House of Black and White, which contains a public shrine with idols of many death gods, including the Stranger of the Faith of the Seven. The worshipers of the Many-Faced God believe <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>is</b> a merciful end to suffering. God may grant a 'gift' of death to those worthy. In the Guild's temple, those who seek an end to suffering may drink from a poisonous fountain.|$|E
500|$|J.B. Aspinall's novel Sycorax (2006) {{places the}} origin of the story with a 14th-century peasant woman from Yorkshire. The Indian poet Suniti Namjoshi in Sycorax: New Fables and Poems imagines Sycorax {{returning}} to the island after Prospero and the others have left (including Caliban). Namjoshi has stated, [...] "The Sycorax in my poem is still alive [...] [...] [...] She is still defiant, still fierce, but she is old and knows <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>is</b> no longer so far away that it need not be thought of... I wanted to follow Sycorax, keep her company, as it were, up to the final moment".|$|E
6000|$|The terrible feeling <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>was</b> so near almost unnerved me, but {{the thought}} of Waboose caused me to utter a roar of mingled rage and despair as I doubled my fist and {{launched}} it full against the monster's nose! ...|$|R
2500|$|Finally, the Court {{considered}} {{whether the}} <b>death</b> penalty <b>is</b> [...] "disproportionate {{in relation to}} the crime for which it <b>is</b> imposed". Although <b>death</b> <b>is</b> severe and irrevocable, the Court could not say <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>was</b> always disproportionate to the crime of deliberately taking human life. [...] "It is an extreme sanction, suitable to the most extreme of crimes." ...|$|R
50|$|There was {{significant}} press interest and internet speculation in 2006 when the sauna {{was closed for}} Easter Weekend, after a 24-year-old man's body was found.

500|$|Three {{modes of}} {{critical}} {{response to the}} Final Destination franchise have predominated. First, it has been framed as a postmodern horror franchise, one which, {{in the style of}} the Scream franchise, self-consciously refers to the history of horror cinema and rewards viewers for their knowledge. Second, the films have been examined for their visual effects. This is particularly true of The Final Destination (2009) and Final Destination 5 (2011). Third, the franchise has been criticized for being cynical and reductive. For example, the film studies scholar Reynold Humphries dismisses the franchise as [...] "obscurantist nonsense whose only 'idea' is <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>is</b> an agency that has a 'plan' for each of us".|$|E
500|$|The {{nightingale}} described {{within the}} poem experiences {{a type of}} death but does not actually die. Instead, the songbird is capable of living through its song, which is a fate that humans cannot expect. The poem ends with an acceptance that pleasure cannot last and <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>is</b> an inevitable part of life. In the poem, Keats imagines {{the loss of the}} physical world and sees himself deadas a [...] "sod" [...] over which the nightingale sings. The contrast between the immortal nightingale and mortal man sitting in his garden, is made all the more acute by an effort of the imagination. The presence of weather is noticeable in the poem, as spring came early in 1819, bringing nightingales all over the heath.|$|E
500|$|Firefight {{was praised}} as [...] "addictive", {{especially}} for showcasing the excellent artificial intelligence of enemies. Jeff Marchiafava of Game Informer credited the enemies with differentiating Firefight from similar game modes in games such as Gears of War 2 or Left 4 Dead, which featured mindless zombies or cannon fodder. The staff of Official Xbox Magazine UK {{wrote that the}} gametype's depth and options made Gears of Wars comparable mode look [...] "simple" [...] in comparison, and that Firefight extended {{the life of the}} game. In contrast, Bramwell felt that in Firefight [...] "there is both a sense of futility in the knowledge <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>is</b> {{only a matter of time}} and odds, and fatigue in the realisation that many levels play out just as they did in the campaign, except a bit more so".|$|E
5000|$|Jing [...] "essence" [...] {{referring}} to the energies of the physical body. Based upon the idea <b>that</b> <b>death</b> <b>was</b> caused by depleting one's jing, Daoist internal alchemy claimed that preserving jing allowed one to achieve longevity, if not immortality. (Schipper 1993, 154).|$|R
