This approach requires the study of micromanipulation strategies adapted to the microworld and especially to the surface and adhesion forces. We are focusing our works on the study of robotic assembly methods applied to objects whose size is below 100 micrometers. The handling strategy used is based on a <b>two</b> <b>fingered</b> <b>gripper.</b> In order to reduce the adhesion between the gripper and the manipulated objects specific end-effectors have been developed. Moreover, to improve the release reliability we are using a polymer substrate which induces high adhesion with the objet. Some automatic pick-and-places on objects whose typical size is 40 micrometers have been done (cycle time of 1. 8 second). There show the reliability of the proposed approach...|$|E

40|$|We are {{investigating}} the problem of removing 3 D objects from a heap without having recourse to object models. As we are relying on geometric information alone, the use of range data is a natural choice. To ensure that we see opposite patches of the object surfaces, we use up to three range views from different directions. These views are triangulated using the data points as vertices. After merging the views, the resulting surface description is segmented into patches which correspond to object parts. We present a novel approach to search for grasping opportunities on a selected part. We allow all combinations of two vertices to be possible contact points for the <b>two</b> <b>finger</b> <b>gripper.</b> Based on evidence accumulation of local features, a quality measure is defined {{for each of these}} vertex pairs.

40|$|In the MIT ci ss Introduction to Robotics, a two link {{robotic arm}} {{is used to}} learn about robots however, the arm is limited since its only {{function}} is movement. In {{order to create a}} more meaningful and useful experience for students in the class, an end effecter with position feedback is going to be design and created as a third link for the current arm. Once complete, it will add functionality to the robot, namely picking up objects, by providing students with hands-on experience accomplishing a fundamental human task with a robot. The end effecter is comprised of a gravity link with <b>two</b> <b>finger</b> <b>grippers</b> each having rotating compliant tips which will compress around the object selected for lifting. The gravity link will insure that the <b>two</b> <b>fingers</b> are always vertical and the rotation on the tips will allow the fingers to be in the correct orientation so they can grasp around an object and pick it up.

40|$|The {{key element}} of robot is its gripper system, which can {{accommodate}} a variety of work pieces. <b>Two</b> <b>finger</b> <b>grippers</b> sometimes of lever type, cam type, gear type or mixed type are very common for many industrial applications. The present paper aims at the design and development of a four-fingered dextrous gripper with suitable electrical actuator system for transferring and transmitting flexural motions of the articulated fingers with suitable mechanical structures and tendons. Various hardware elements have been designed, constructed and evaluated for the dextrous hand. Each finger is having distal, proximal and metacarpophalangeal joints having three degrees of freedom so as to open and close with different postures for manipulating the objects with electric tendon actuation system. As a first step towards achieving pretension, optimal flexibility, high performance and well-behaved characteristics of the gripper, a multiple degree-of-freedom dextrous hand has been designed, constructed and evaluated. Various tactile and non-tactile sensors have been designed and mounted on the fingers with necessary control. During the execution of tasks, slip sensors provide information for grasping and manipulating the objects with certainty. The force sensors provide the magnitude of optimum force during grasping without slip. Thus the prototype gripper {{has been found to}} be capable of grasping the objects of different shapes with an optimal force...|$|R

The system primarily comprises of four main modules: (1) Perception module responsible for recognizing query objects and localizing them in the 3 -dimensional robot workspace; (2) Planning module generates necessary paths that the robot end- effector has to take for reaching the objects in the rack or in the tote; (3) Calibration module that defines the physical workspace for the robot visible through the on-board vision system; and (4) Gripping and suction system for picking and stowing different kinds of objects. The perception module uses a faster region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) to recognize objects. We designed a novel <b>two</b> <b>finger</b> <b>gripper</b> that incorporates pneumatic valve based suction effect to enhance its ability to pick different kinds of objects.

To make an arm robot simulator, we used acrylic as a base material, servomotor as a driver and an Arduino Uno SMD as microcontroller. Acrylic was chosen because it is light, strong and durable.

IPMC actuation for micro gripping is produced by deflecting material according to bending moment theory. An external electric field generated by suitable RC circuit causes this deflection. It is found that an IPMC actuates from 1 – 5 seconds. The maximum jaw opening and closing position of micro gripper are found to be 5 mm and 0. 5 mm respectively.

40|$|This {{study has}} been {{conducted}} {{to take advantage of}} geometrical similarity of parts within a family in the design of a robotic gripper set for the quick-gripper-changer. The group technology concept was used to define the part families. Four different coding and classification methods are used to analyze and define the sets of grippers. These methods include two different coding methods and two different classification methods. The coding methods include production flow analysis (PFA) based on a process routing and the Opitz system based on a part geometry. The classification methods include rank order cluster analysis (ROCA) and cluster analysis with similarity coefficients (CASA). The following four methods have been used in this study to group parts into families. (1) Production flow analysis/Rank order cluster analysis. (2) Production flow analysis/Cluster analysis with similarity coefficient. (3) Opitz/Rank order cluster analysis. (4) Opitz/Cluster analysis with similarity coefficient;Softwares for the four coding and classification methods were developed in this research. By means of the software, part families were defined.

40|$|Variable {{reluctance}} actuators {{have been}} used widely as low-cost, on-off type mechanical actuators, due to their inherit advantages of rugged-construction and ease-of-manufacture. This paper reports on the investigation work of applying variable-reluctance principle {{to the design of}} a novel two-finger gripper. Contrary to previous on-off type variable reluctance devices, the proposed actuator can be operated in position-control, velocity-control, and force-control modes. To enable effective control of the two-finger variable-reluctance gripper, its electromagnetic and mechanical properties have to be fully investigated, and an efficient model has to be constructed. Since the forces on the <b>two</b> <b>fingers</b> of the <b>gripper</b> are produced by the variation of flux, and flux is a nonlinear quantity, the electromagnetic characteristics of the two-finger gripper are much more complex than other types of devices (e. g. permanent magnet voice coil). Moreover, the existences of coupling effects make the characterization of the gripper even more complicated. In the past, most mutual coupling effects in variable reluctance machines are neglected for the sake of simplicity. However, due to the unique structure of the two-finger variable-reluctance gripper, it was found that mutual coupling can constitute significant modeling discrepancy. The work described in this paper is {{the first of its kind}} to carry out a detail study on the electromagnetic properties of a tightly-coupled two-finger variable-reluctance gripper, including its mutual-coupling effects. In the study, the flux modeling of a mutually coupled variable reluctance gripper is carried out. Magnetic equations of the actuator structure are derived and the flux model is constructed. To verify the study results, a similar two-finger variable-reluctance gripper was fabricated and its electro-magnetic characteristics were measured. When the measured results were compared with the model simulation, it was found that the two sets of data matched quite well with each other and confirmed that the model was an accurate representation of the two-finger variable-reluctance gripper. The investigation work describes in this paper enables a better understanding of mutually-coupled limited-stroke variable-reluctance actuators. Furthermore-, it produces an effective simulation model for the future design and control of this class of device. Department of Electrical EngineeringRefereed conference pape...|$|R
