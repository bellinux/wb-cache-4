40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effects of a}} traditional speed and agility training program (TSA) and an enforced stopping program emphasizing deceleration (ESSA). Twenty college-aged team sport athletes (16 males, 4 females) were allocated into the training groups. Pretesting and posttesting included: 0 – 10, 0 – 20, 0 – 40 m sprint intervals, change-of-direction, and acceleration test (CODAT), T-test (multidirectional speed); vertical, standing broad, lateral, and drop jumps, medicine ball throw (power); Star Excursion Balance Test (posteromedial, medial, anteromedial reaches; dynamic stability); and concentric (240 °·s - 1) and eccentric (30 °·s - 1) knee extensor and flexor isokinetic testing (unilateral strength). Both groups completed a 6 -week speed and agility program. The ESSA subjects decelerated to a stop within a specified distance in each drill. A repeated measures analysis of variance determined significant (p ≤ 0. 05) within- and between-group changes. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) were calculated. The TSA group improved all speed <b>tests</b> (<b>d</b> = 0. 29 – 0. 96), and most power <b>tests</b> (<b>d</b> = 0. 57 – 1. 10). The ESSA group improved the 40 -m sprint, CODAT, T-test, and most power <b>tests</b> (<b>d</b> = 0. 46 – 1. 31) but did not significantly decrease 0 – 10 and 0 – 20 m times. The TSA group increased posteromedial and medial excursions (d = 0. 97 – 1. 89); the ESSA group increased medial excursions (d = 0. 99 – 1. 09). The ESSA group increased concentric knee extensor and flexor strength, but also increased between-leg knee flexor strength differences (d = 0. 50 – 1. 39). The loading associated with stopping can increase unilateral strength.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that male rats have an advantage in acquiring place-learning strategies, allowing them to learn spatial tasks more readily than female rats. However many of these differences have been examined solely during acquisition or in 24 h memory retention. Here, we investigated whether sex differences exist in remote long-term memory, lasting 30 d after training, and {{whether there are differences}} in the expression pattern of molecular markers associated with long-term memory maintenance. Specifically, we analyzed the expression of protein kinase M zeta (PKMζ) and the α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit GluA 2. To adequately evaluate memory retention, we used a robust training protocol to attenuate sex differences in acquisition and found differential effects in memory retention 1 d and 30 d after training. Female cohorts tested for memory retention 1 d after 60 training trials outperformed males by making significantly fewer reference memory errors at test. In contrast, male cohorts <b>tested</b> 30 <b>d</b> after 60 training trials outperformed females of the same condition, making fewer reference memory errors and achieving significantly higher retention test scores. Furthermore, given 60 training trials, females <b>tested</b> 30 <b>d</b> later showed significantly worse memory compared to females <b>tested</b> 1 <b>d</b> later, while males <b>tested</b> 30 <b>d</b> later did not differ from males <b>tested</b> 1 <b>d</b> later. Together these data suggest that with robust training males do no retain spatial information as well as females do 24 h post-training but maintain this spatial information for longer. Males also showed a significant increase in synaptic PKMζ expression and a positive correlation with retention test scores, while females did not. Interestingly, both sexes showed a positive correlation between retention test scores and synaptic GluA 2 expression. Furthermore, the increased expression of synaptic PKMζ, associated with male memory but not with female memory, identifies another potential sex-mediated difference in memory processing...|$|R

Gerrits*, Wageningen University, Wageningen, the Netherlands. Effects of linoleic acid (LA) and a-linolenic acid (ALA) on behaviour of individually housed pigs (15 - 30 kg BW) were studied. In a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, 32 gilts from 4 litters were {{assigned to one of}} four dietary treatments, varying in LA and ALA intake. Differences between low and high intake levels were designed to be identical for LA and ALA: Low ALA and LA intakes were 0. 15 and 1. 30, and high ALA and LA intakes were 1. 45 and 2. 60 g/(kg BW 0. 75. d), respectively.

(BNI) on the River Protection Project-Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (RPP-WTP) project to perform {{research}} and development activities to resolve technical issues identified for the Pretreatment Facility (PTF). The Pretreatment Engineering Platform (PEP) was designed, constructed and operated {{as part of a}} plan to respond to issue M 12, "Undemonstrated Leaching Processes" of the External Flowsheet Review Team (EFRT) issue response plan. The PEP is a 1 / 4. 5 -scale test platform designed to simulate the WTP pretreatment caustic leaching, oxidative leaching, ultrafiltration solids concentration, and slurry washing processes. The PEP replicates the WTP leaching processes using prototypic equipment and control strategies. The PEP also includes non-prototypic ancillary equipment to support the core processing. Two operating scenarios are currently being evaluated for the ultrafiltration process (UFP) and leaching operations. The first scenario (Test B and D) has caustic leaching performed in the UFP- 2 ultrafiltration feed vessels (i. e., vessel UFP-VSL-T 02 A in the PEP and vessels UFP-VSL- 00002 A and B in the WTP PTF). The second scenario (Test A) has caustic leaching conducted in the UFP- 1 ultrafiltration feed preparation vessels (i. e., vessels UFP-VSL-T 01 A and B in the PEP and vessels UFP VSL- 00001 A and B in the WTP PTF). In <b>Test</b> <b>D,</b> 19 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH, caustic) was added to the waste slurry in the UFP VSL T 02 vessel after the solids were concentrated to ~ 20 % undissolved solids. The NaOH was added to leach solid aluminum compounds (e. g., gibbsite, boehmite). Caustic addition is followed by heating to 85 °C using direct injection of steam to accelerate the leach process. The main difference of <b>Test</b> <b>D</b> compared to Test B is that the leach temperature is 85 °C for 24 hrs as compared to 100 °C for 12 hours. The other difference is the <b>Test</b> <b>D</b> simulant had Cr in the simulant from the start of processing and Test B had Cr added to adjust the simulant composition after aluminum leaching. Following the caustic leach, the UFP-VSL-T 02 A vessel contents are cooled using the vessel cooling jacket. The slurry was then concentrated to 17 wt% undissolved solids and washed with inhibited water to remove NaOH and other soluble salts. Next, the slurry was oxidatively leached using sodium permanganate to solubilize chrome. The slurry was then washed to remove the dissolved chrome and concentrated...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} a custody dispute on {{preschool}} children The motivation for the research on which {{this article is based}} highlights the consequences of the placement of children after the divorce of their parents and in instances in which a custody dispute erupts. The functions and purpose of the family advocate in this process are also taken into consideration. The aim of this article was to evaluate children with respect to three variables, namely, 1) positive selfesteem, 2) the loyalty conflict between biological parents and 3) depression. These evaluations were undertaken within three groups, namely, 1) children in a nuclear family, 2) children in a single-parent family where divorce had occurred and 3) children in a family where a custody dispute had taken place. A nonexperimental method of research was used. To test the specific hypotheses the following test instruments were used: 1) Bene-Anthony family relations 2) Draw a Person <b>Test</b> (<b>D.</b> A. P.) and 3) Draw a Family <b>Test</b> (<b>D.</b> A. F.). The conclusions arrived at indicate firstly, that children in nuclear families do have a higher self-esteem than children from single-parent divorced families, but the latter, in turn, do not have a higher self-esteem than those from families undergoing a custody dispute. Furthermore, children from nuclear families do not experience less loyalty conflict than children from single-parent divorced families, but the latter experience less loyalty conflict than those from families undergoing a custody dispute. Finally, children from nuclear families suffer less from depression than children from single-parent divorcedfamilies, but the latter do not experience less depression than those from families exposed to a custody dispute. As the research on which this article is based merely has an exploratory nature, only general trends can be deduced from the results.
