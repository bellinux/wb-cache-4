40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to describe the Salmonella prevalence in turkey flocks before and after the implementation of the Salmonella control program in Germany and to identify factors that are potentially associated with the presence of Salmonella in the flocks. To achieve this, all breeding flocks and a representative sample of the fattening flocks were tested for Salmonella. None of the 98 turkey breeding flocks but 31 (10. 3 %) of 300 <b>turkey</b> <b>fattening</b> flocks were positive for Salmonella spp. in the baseline study during 2006 / 2007. In 11 (3. 7 %) fattening flocks S. Enteritidis (1 flock; 0. 3 %) or S. Typhimurium (8 flocks; 2. 7 %) or monophasic S. Typhimurium (2 flocks; 0. 3 %), which are of special public health relevance in Germany, were detected. Logistic regression analysis confirmed that production type and season were significant risk factors for the presence of Salmonella spp. in <b>fattening</b> <b>turkey</b> flocks in Germany. Data from mandatory official testing within the Salmonella control program in 2010 and 2011 revealed that Salmonella prevalence in <b>turkey</b> <b>fattening</b> flocks has decreased significantly to 3. 3 % and 2. 6 %. In line with this result, prevalence of S. Enteritidis or S. Typhimurium had decreased to 2. 6 % and 1. 5 %.

This species is considered by EFSA to be suitable for the {{qualified presumption of safety}} approach to establishing safety for the target species, consumers and the environment. This approach requires the identity of the active agent to be established and the absence of toxigenic potential and resistance to antibiotics of human or veterinary clinical significance to be demonstrated. EFSA considered these issues and reported the results in a previous opinion {{on the use of the}} product in chickens for fattening. The applicant is now requesting the authorisation of the additive in diets for <b>turkeys</b> for <b>fattening</b> and <b>turkeys</b> reared for breeding at a dose of 1 × 108 CFU/kg complete feedingstuffs.

The additive {{is to be used}} as a feed additive for chickens and <b>turkeys</b> for <b>fattening,</b> laying hens, piglets (weaned) and pigs for fattening, ducks, guinea fowls, quails, geese, pheasants and pigeons. Tolerance trials performed in chickens and <b>turkeys</b> for <b>fattening,</b> laying hens and piglets showed that the animals tolerated well 200 -fold (chickens, turkeys and piglets) or 20 -fold (laying hens) the recommended dosage. Therefore, the additive is safe for these target species at the recommended dose. The conclusion can be extended to pigs for fattening and can be extrapolated to ducks, guinea fowls, quails, geese, pheasants and pigeons provided that the same dose applies. The fermentation product used for the preparation of the additive gave negative results for mutagenicity. The results obtained in a sub-chronic oral toxicity study raised no concerns regarding the product. Therefore, the additive gives rise to no concern for consumer safety.

To accomplish this aims, totally 288 d old large white turkey chicks (144 in each sex) were used. Beaks of 77 male and female poults were trimmed when 8 d old with an electrical beak trimmer. The birds were fed by commercial turkey rasion. Experiment was designed as 2 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with 3 replications in each group. Beak trimming and stocking density did not affect live weight, carcass composition and its components. The higher LW and carcass weight observed in trimmed groups. As expected, male birds are heavier than female, and carcass percentage (CP) would be adverse. However, in this study, CP of male was higher in trimmed, in 0. 25 m 2 /bird. (D) × sex (S) interaction had an effect on both CP and thigh weights (p< 0. 05). Significantly D×S was observed in LW, CP and PG. The weight of carcass and its some components were higher in male.

40|$|The {{additive}} hydroxy-analogue of selenomethionine {{consists of}} synthetic R,S- 2 -hydroxy- 4 -methylselenobutanoic acid (HMSeBA) and {{is intended to}} be used as a source of the essential trace element selenium for all animal species/categories. Based on data from tolerance studies in chickens and <b>turkeys</b> for <b>fattening</b> and piglets, the additive is considered as safe for all species/categories up to the maximum authorised total selenium level in complete feed. After being absorbed, HMSeBA is metabolised to selenomethionine; consequently, no residues of the compound itself occur in animal tissues and products. Compared with inorganic selenium sources, the use of HMSeBA in animal nutrition would result in a similar increase in selenium deposition in animal tissues/products as that resulting from selenised yeast. To ensure consumer safety from consumption of food originating from animals supplemented with HMSeBA, the FEEDAP Panel concluded that selenium supplementation from the additive should not exceed a maximum of 0. 2 mg Se/kg complete feed. The additive should be regarded as an eye irritant, but should not be classified as skin irritant or skin sensitiser. Inhalation exposure poses a hazard to users; the FEEDAP Panel concludes, therefore, that the formulation and conditions of use of the solid form of the additive should minimise user exposure by inhalation. The use of HMSeBA in feed does not pose an additional risk to the environment, compared to other sources of selenium for which it will substitute, as long as the maximum authorised content in feedingstuffs is not exceeded. Based on the response of plasma glutathione peroxidase activity and the plasma/liver concentration of selenium in chickens for fattening and pigs for fattening, the FEEDAP Panel considers that HMSeBA is an efficaceous source of selenium for all animal species/categories.

The FEEDAP Panel notes that for <b>turkeys</b> for <b>fattening,</b> equines, bovines, ovines and pigs the maximum content for vitamin D 3 in feed {{does not provide}} any margin of safety, and that, except for pigs, the maximum content is above the upper safe level, according to National Research Council data when animals were fed a supplemented diet for more than 60 days. No safety concern was identified {{for the use of}} vitamin D 3 in chickens for fattening and fish. Not withstanding the long history of supplementing compound feed with vitamin D and the absence of publicly reported intolerances, the FEEDAP Panel is {{not in a position to}} draw final conclusions on the safety of vitamin D and considers the current maximum contents as temporarily acceptable. Any additional administration of vitamin D 3 via water for drinking represents a safety concern. Current nutritional surveys in 14 European countries showed that vitamin D intake is sufficiently below the upper safe limit. The FEEDAP Panel assumes that foodstuffs of animal origin were produced following current production practices, including vitamin D 3 supplementation of feed and concludes that the use of vitamin D in animal nutrition at the currently authorised maximum dietary content has not and will not cause the tolerable upper intake level to be exceeded. Vitamin D 3 is not an irritant to skin and eyes and is not a skin sensitiser. Inhaled vitamin D 3 is highly toxic; exposure to dust is harmful to persons handling the additive. No risk to the environment resulting from the use of vitamin D 3 in animal nutrition is expected. The vitamin D 3 under application is regarded as an effective dietary source of the vitamin in animal nutrition...|$|R
40|$|In a {{long term}} {{research}} project in Germany the influence of husbandry {{on the health of}} <b>fattening</b> <b>turkeys</b> (Study 1) as well as the influence of practiced rearing conditions on the health of turkey poults (Study 2) was examined in 24 farms and at the meat processing plant. In all examined rearing farms, litter samples for the determination of litter moisture were taken. This paper summarizes the results obtained by our working group from 2007 until 2012. The results elucidate the universal problem of foot pad dermatitis (FPD). Nearly 100 % of the observed turkeys showed a clinically apparent FPD at the meat processing plant. Furthermore, skin lesions of the breast, especially breast buttons were diagnosed, particularly at the slaughterhouse. FPD was detected {{in the first week of}} the rearing phase. Prevalence and degree showed a progressive development up to the age of 22 – 35 days, whereas 63. 3 % of the poults had foot pad alterations. As even mild alterations in the foot pad condition can be indicators for suboptimal design of the rearing environment, especially high litter moisture, it is important to focus on the early rearing phase...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze the effect of a blend of phytogenic {{additive}} on nutritional and mineral composition of breast, thigh muscles and liver in <b>fattening</b> <b>turkeys.</b> A total 300 female turkeys were monitored in the trial. 1 -day old broad-breasted white turkeys hybrid XL were randomly divided into two groups (150 pcs per each). Turkeys in control group were fed by standard diet for fattening and in experimental group from the 1 st to the 12 th week by complete feed mixture with supplementation of a blend of essential oils from origanum, anise and citrus fruits as well as a prebiotic rich fructooligosaccharides in dosage 1 kg per 1000 kg of feed mixture. Turkeys were housed in group on deep litter. Experiment lasted 18 weeks. Samples of breast and thigh muscles, and liver for nutritional analysis were collected during turkey’s dissection (10 samples per each group). After the determination of nutrients, there were found significant (P 0. 05) content of DM and fat was recorded in liver. After analysis the macro and microelements, significant (P 0. 05) concentrate only in content of manganese in experimental group. Occurrence of manganese was not observed in both muscles...|$|R
40|$|Skin {{samples of}} {{reticulate}} scales from the metatarsal and digital foot pads from heavy-breed Big 6 turkeys were macroscopically, light microscopically, histochemically, transmission and scanning electron microscopically {{as well as}} biochemically examined. Additionally, a field trial investigating the influence of variable, economically justifiable biotin levels on the devel-opment of foot pad lesions was conducted and statistically analysed. In its basic structures, the reticulate scale epidermis of <b>fattening</b> <b>turkeys</b> is {{comparable to that of}} broilers. Nevertheless, the results presented here suggest that there are differences within the bird population and that an age dependent maturation of the skin as a whole occurred. The results on the epidermal lipid metabolism of the reticulate scales are contrary to any pre-vious investigation in birds and emphasises the need of further investigations of the mecha-nism and structure of the avian permeability barrier. Based on my results, the permeability barrier in turkeys is solely maintained by the interdigitation of glycolipids located within the lipid cell envelope of neighbouring sebocorneocytes. In birds these glycolipids originate from lipid bilayer residuals of the broken down multigranular bodies, rather than their limiting membrane as in mammals. The observed foot pad lesions are the consequence of a progressive inflammatory reaction. In severe cases an ulcer is formed. With increasing age these ulcers can heal, leaving visible scar tissue behind. The occurrence of foot pad lesions is associated with a decrease of epi-dermal &# 969; 6 -fatty acids and a change in the hydroxy fatty acid pattern. It was not possible to demonstrate an influence of the different biotin levels on the structure of the reticulate scales from the examined turkeys. An influence of biotin on the epidermal fatty acid pattern and the macroscopic evaluation of the foot health was detectable only in positive environmental conditions. None of the applied biotin levels compensated for the negative environmental influences or prevented the development of foot pad lesions. A posi-tive effect on the healing of existing foot pad lesions was detectable using high biotin levels in the last seven weeks of fattening. The skin from the various turkeys examined had an indi-vidually varying affinity to develop foot pad lesions and also, a genetic factor cannot be ex-cluded. Consequently, exclusion of affected chicks from the breeding program should be considered. Avoiding a decrease of biotin levels during the last seven fattening weeks under optimal envi-ronmental conditions seems advisable to improve foot health in male <b>fattening</b> <b>turkeys.</b> With-out a doubt, foot pad lesions are an issue concerning animal welfare and should attract more attention. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of a phytogenic additive on blood serum indicator levels and fatty acids profile of breast, leg muscles and liver in <b>fattening</b> <b>turkeys.</b> The experiment was realized in private turkey farm and in the Department of Animal Nutrition, Faculty of Agrobiology and Food Resources, Slovak University of Agriculture in Nitra. A total of 300 clinically healthy female turkeys (broad-breasted white turkey, hybrid XL) were used in the experiment. Female turkeys were randomly divided into two groups (150 pcs per each). In the control group, turkey were fed with standard complete feed mixtures for fattening, in the experimental group, standard diets from the beginning to 12 th week were supplemented with the a blend of essential oils from origanum, anise and citrus fruits as well as a prebiotic rich fructooligosaccharides in dosage 1 kg per 1000 kg of feed mixture. Fattening lasted 18 weeks. Blood serum was collected at the end of the experiment, during the slaughter of birds. Samples of breast and leg muscles, and liver for fatty acids composition evaluation were collected during birds dissection (10 samples per each group). After the 12 weeks of phytoadditive supplementation, a tendency of lower activity of serum alanine aminotransferase (53. 963 vs. 3. 499 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (6. 238 vs. 1. 012 U/L) in experimental group of turkeys was found (P 0. 01) content of cis- 8, 11, 14 -eicosadienoic and arachidonic acids. The phytoadditive supplementation significantly (P< 0. 01) decreased content of some unsaturated fatty acids in turkeys tissues, as well.
