25|$|In the {{two years}} {{following}} the sinking, engineers used ROVs to seal cracks in the tanker's hull, now 4000 meters below the sea surface, and slowed the leakage to a trickle of 20 litres a day. By 2004, engineers had removed the oil still in the tanker by drilling small holes in the wreck, using remotely operated submersible vehicles (ROVs) {{like the one that}} originally explored the wreck of the RMS Titanic. The oil was then pumped into large aluminium shuttles, specially manufactured for this salvage operation. The filled shuttles were then floated to the surface. The original plan to fill large bags with the oil proved to be too problematic and slow. After the oil removal was completed, a slurry rich in microbiologic agents was pumped in the hold to speed up the breakdown of any remaining oil.

500|$|By the 1950s, motor {{traffic levels}} along Park Lane had reached {{saturation}} point. A 1956 {{survey by the}} Metropolitan Police reported [...] "at peak hours it is overloaded", with traffic surveys showing 91,000 and 65,000 vehicles travelling around Hyde Park Corner and Marble Arch respectively in a twelve-hour period, making Park Lane {{the link between the}} busiest and third busiest road junctions in London. Between 1960 and 1963, the road was widened to three lanes each way either side of a central reservation. This required the demolition of Nos.145–148 Piccadilly, near Hyde Park Corner, which had previously formed a line east of Apsley House. The work also re-appropriated East Carriage Drive inside Hyde Park as the northbound carriageway, moving the park's boundary westwards. Additionally, a car park was installed under the road, which became the largest underground parking area in London. Care was taken to preserve as much of the park as possible during the widening works; in all, [...] of park was removed and around 95 trees were felled. At the time of opening, the project was the largest road improvement scheme in Central London since the construction of Kingsway in 1905. The <b>total</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>cost</b> was £1,152,000 (now £). Further traffic signals were installed at the junction of Park Lane and Hyde Park corner in 1983.|$|E
