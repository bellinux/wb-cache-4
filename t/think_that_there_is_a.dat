25|$|When {{scientists}} use {{the idea}} of parsimony, it has meaning only in a very specific context of inquiry. Several background assumptions are required for parsimony to connect with plausibility in a particular research problem. The reasonableness of parsimony in one research context may {{have nothing to do}} with its reasonableness in another. It is a mistake to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> single global principle that spans diverse subject matter.|$|E

2500|$|The Spectator in 1869 concurred with Stott's opinion, writing [...] "Mr Dickens {{has brought}} people to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sort of piety in being gushing and maudlin," [...] {{and that his}} works are heavily imbued with the [...] "most mawkish and unreal sentimentalism", but the {{unsigned}} critic still maintained that Dickens {{was one of the}} great authors of his time.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after {{completing}} his lengthy confessions in 1991, Dahmer had requested to Detective Patrick Murphy {{that he be}} given {{a copy of the}} Bible. This request was granted and Dahmer gradually devoted himself to Christianity and became a born-again Christian. On his father's urging, he also read creationist books from the Institute for Creation Research. In May 1994, Dahmer was baptized by Roy Ratcliff, a minister in the Church Of Christ and a graduate of Oklahoma Christian University, in the prison whirlpool. Following his baptism, Ratcliff visited Dahmer on a weekly basis up until November 1994. Dahmer and Ratcliff regularly discussed the prospect of death, and Dahmer questioned whether he was sinning against God by continuing to live. Referring to his crimes in a 1994 interview with Stone Phillips on Dateline NBC, Dahmer had stated: [...] "If a person doesn't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> God to be accountable to, then what's the point of trying to modify your behavior to keep it within acceptable ranges? That's how I thought anyway." ...|$|E
