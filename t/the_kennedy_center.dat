5|$|After Isaacs left, {{there was}} a period of {{managerial}} instability, with three chief executives in three years.

A new board appointed Michael Kaiser as general director in September 1998. He oversaw the restoration of the two companies' finances and the re-opening of the opera house.

When the family visits the White House, they encounter then-First Lady Barbara Bush in the bathtub {{of one of the}} many bathrooms. Another American landmark mentioned in the episode is Mount Rushmore.

In addition, Lisa proposes that the family attend the memorial of the fictional Winifred Beecher Howe, an early crusader for women's rights who later appeared on the unpopular 75-cent coins according to Lisa. This is a reference to the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin, which was only minted for three years and never became popular.|$|E
