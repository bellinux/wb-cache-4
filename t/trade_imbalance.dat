Its positive effects are felt throughout the economy of Croatia in terms of increased business volume observed in retail business, processing industry orders and summer seasonal employment. The industry is considered an export business, because it significantly reduces the country's external <b>trade</b> <b>imbalance.</b> Since {{the conclusion of the}} Croatian War of Independence, the tourist industry has grown rapidly, recording a fourfold rise in tourist numbers, with more than 11million tourists each year. The most numerous are tourists from Germany, Slovenia, Austria, Italy and the Czech Republic as well as Croatia itself. Length of a tourist stay in Croatia averages 4.9 days.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{contentious}} {{issues facing the}} First Congress during its inaugural session was {{the issue of how}} to raise revenue for the federal government. There were both domestic and foreign Revolutionary War-related debts, as well as a <b>trade</b> <b>imbalance</b> with Great Britain that was crippling American industries and draining the nation of its currency. The first effort to begin addressing these issues resulted in the Tariff of 1789, authorizing the collection of duties on imported goods. Signed into law by the president on July 4, 1789, the act established the United States Customs Service and its ports of entry. One year later, the Revenue-Marine was established when Washington signed legislation authorizing construction of ten cutters to enforce federal tariff and trade laws and to prevent smuggling. Until Congress established the Navy Department in 1798, it served as the nation's only armed force afloat. Renamed a century later as the Revenue Cutter Service, it and the U.S. Life-Saving Service were merged in 1915 to form the United States Coast Guard.|$|E

He {{established}} his own business in 1746 and published his first book of engravings around the same time. Boydell did not think much of his own artistic efforts and eventually started buying the works of others, becoming a print dealer {{as well as an}} artist. He became a successful importer of French prints during the 1750s but was frustrated by their refusal to trade prints in kind. To spark reciprocal trade, he commissioned William Wollett's spectacular engraving of Richard Wilson's The Destruction of the Children of Niobe, which revolutionised the print trade. Ten years later, {{largely as a result of}} Boydell's initiative, the <b>trade</b> <b>imbalance</b> had shifted, and he was named a fellow of the Royal Society for his efforts.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multi-asset model of stock returns {{in a market}} where some investors place inelastic orders that are uncorrelated with fundamentals. Risk-averse rational arbitrageurs accommodate <b>trading</b> <b>imbalances</b> but require compensation. The compensation manifests itself as predictable return reversals. Our model predicts that whenever underlying fundamentals are correlated, <b>trading</b> <b>imbalances</b> also create cross-stock (temporary) price pressure. We test implications of the model and show pervasive price pressure at daily, weekly, and monthly frequencies. A zero-cost portfolio based on sorting <b>trading</b> <b>imbalances</b> into deciles earns a riskadjusted average return of 79 bp per week. Contemporaneous cross-stock <b>trading</b> <b>imbalances</b> have a price impact that is four times larger for same-industry versus different-industry pairs of stocks.

He supported Alexander Hamilton's economic policies whereby the federal government assumed the debts of the state governments and established the First Bank of the United States, the United States Mint, and the United States Customs Service. Congress passed the Tariff of 1789, the Tariff of 1790, and an excise tax on whiskey to fund the government and, {{in the case of the}} tariffs, address the <b>trade</b> <b>imbalance</b> with Britain. Washington personally led federal soldiers in suppressing the Whiskey Rebellion, which arose in opposition to the administration's taxation policies. He directed the Northwest Indian War, which saw the United States establish control over Native American tribes in the Northwest Territory. In foreign affairs, he assured domestic tranquility and maintained peace with the European powers despite the raging French Revolutionary Wars by issuing the 1793 Proclamation of Neutrality. He also secured two important bilateral treaties, the 1794 Jay Treaty with Great Britain and the 1795 Treaty of San Lorenzo with Spain, both of which fostered trade and helped secure control of the American frontier. To protect American shipping from Barbary pirates and other threats, he re-established the United States Navy with the Naval Act of 1794.|$|E
25|$|Canton was {{the only}} port in China open to foreign countries, mostly European, for trade under the Canton System. In {{the early stages of}} this {{commerce}} the demand in foreign countries for commodities including tea, silk and porcelain greatly outweighed Chinese needs for foreign products, and thus a significant <b>trade</b> <b>imbalance</b> developed. This unequal situation ended in the late 18th century when opium was shipped into China from plantations in India owned by the British East India Company. The number of people using the drug in China grew rapidly, {{to the point that the}} <b>trade</b> <b>imbalance</b> shifted in the foreign countries' favor.

25|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries {{demand for}} Chinese goods (particularly silk, porcelain, and tea) in Europe created a <b>trade</b> <b>imbalance</b> between Qing Imperial China and Great Britain. European silver flowed into China through the Canton System, which {{confined}} incoming foreign trade {{to the southern}} port city of Canton. To counter this imbalance, the British East India Company began to auction opium grown in India to independent foreign traders in exchange for silver, {{and in doing so}} strengthened its trading influence in Asia. The opium was transported to the Chinese coast where local middlemen made massive profits selling the drug inside China. The influx of narcotics reversed the Chinese trade surplus, drained the economy of silver, and increased the numbers of opium addicts inside the country, outcomes that worried Chinese officials.|$|E
25|$|In 1841, Jardines had 19 {{intercontinental}} clipper ships, {{compared to}} close rival Dent and Company with 13. Jardines also {{had hundreds of}} small ships, lorchas and small smuggling crafts for coastal and upriver smuggling. The trading concerns of Jardine's included smuggling opium into China from India, trading spices and sugar from the Philippines, importing Chinese tea and silk into England, handling cargo papers and cargo insurance, renting of dockyard facilities and warehouse space, trade financing and other numerous lines of business and trade. During the mid-1830s, trade with China was becoming more difficult due to the Qing government's increasing restrictions on the narcotic trade in part to control the worsening outflow of silver. This <b>trade</b> <b>imbalance</b> stemmed {{from the fact that}} Western traders were importing more opium into China than they were exporting teas and silk.|$|E
25|$|In {{early modern}} Europe, there was {{significant}} demand for products from Mughal India, particularly cotton textiles, {{as well as}} goods such as spices, peppers, indigo, silks, and saltpeter (for use in munitions). European fashion, for example, became increasingly dependent on Mughal Indian textiles and silks. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Mughal India accounted for 95% of British imports from Asia, and the Bengal Subah province alone accounted for 40% of Dutch imports from Asia. Amiya Kumar Bagchi estimates 10.3% of Bihar's populus were involved in hand spinning thread, 2.3% weaving, and 9% in other manufacturing trades, in 1809-13, to satisfy this demand. In contrast, {{there was very little}} demand for European goods in Mughal India, which was largely self-sufficient, thus Europeans had very little to offer, except for some woolens, unprocessed metals and a few luxury items. The <b>trade</b> <b>imbalance</b> caused Europeans to export large quantities of gold and silver to Mughal India in order to pay for Indian imports.|$|E
