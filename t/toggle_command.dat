5000|$|The JK {{flip-flop}} augments {{the behavior}} of the SR flip-flop (J=Set, K=Reset) by interpreting the J = K = 1 condition as a [...] "flip" [...] or <b>toggle</b> <b>command.</b> Specifically, the combination J = 1, K = 0 is a command to set the flip-flop; the combination J = 0, K = 1 is a command to reset the flip-flop; and the combination J = K = 1 is a command to toggle the flip-flop, i.e., change its output to the logical complement of its current value. Setting J = K = 0 maintains the current state. To synthesize a D flip-flop, simply set K equal to the complement of J. Similarly, to synthesize a T flip-flop, set K equal to J. The JK flip-flop is therefore a universal flip-flop, because it can be configured to work as an SR flip-flop, a D flip-flop, or a T flip-flop.|$|E
50|$|Like Propellerhead's Reason, Record's {{interface}} {{includes a}} <b>Toggle</b> Rack <b>command,</b> which flips the rack around {{to display the}} devices from the rear. Here the user can route virtual audio and CV cables from one piece of equipment to another. This cable layout enables the creation of complex effects chains and allows devices to modulate one another.|$|R
5000|$|... 4 April 2007: First use of firecode reset of {{spacecraft}} {{at approximately}} 2130 UTC. This <b>command</b> <b>toggles</b> the reset {{switch on the}} MIP-405 processor and reboots the operating system. This reset returned the CFTP and MiDN experiments to off and cleared all command buffers. At 2324 UTC the spacecraft responded to a transmitter on command. Telemetry confirmed that the reboot was successful.|$|R
5000|$|Reason's {{interface}} {{includes a}} <b>Toggle</b> Rack <b>command,</b> which turns the [...] "rack" [...] around {{to display the}} devices from the rear. Here the user can route virtual audio and CV cables from one piece of equipment to another. This cable layout enables the creation of complex effects chains and allows devices to modulate one another. This offers flexibility {{in the way that}} is familiar to users of physical electronic music hardware. For example, Redrum's main outputs could be connected to a single channel of the mixing desk, or instead each of its drum sounds could be routed to a separate EQ before sending them to separate channels in the mixer, or rather than audio output the channels of the ReDrum could be used to trigger the gates of an Alligator via CV. The user can always choose where to draw the line between simplicity and precision, allowing the software to remain useful at various levels of knowledge on the user's part.|$|R
