5|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> {{deficiency}} of the Roman army remained its shortage of cavalry, especially heavy cavalry. As Rome's borders expanded and its adversaries changed from largely infantry-based to largely cavalry-based troops, the infantry-based Roman army began to find itself at a tactical disadvantage, {{particularly in the}} East.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> {{benefit of}} {{adopting}} {{a single currency}} is to remove the cost of exchanging currency, theoretically allowing businesses and individuals to consummate previously unprofitable trades. For consumers, banks in the eurozone must charge the same for intra-member cross-border transactions as purely domestic transactions for electronic payments (e.g., credit cards, debit cards and cash machine withdrawals).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> {{difference}} between the brains of mammals and other vertebrates {{is in terms of}} size. On average, a mammal has a brain roughly twice as large as that of a bird of the same body size, and ten times as large as that of a reptile of the same body size.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> {{manifestation of}} these links {{can be seen}} in the annual St. Patrick's Day Festival. The festival is {{sponsored}} by the Irish Government and Guinness. The festival runs for over a fortnight and includes lectures, film shows, dance/Gaelic football competitions and music performances. The festival is the largest Irish celebration in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> technology, the centrifuge, failed, but {{electromagnetic}} separation, gaseous diffusion, {{and thermal}} diffusion technologies were all successful {{and contributed to}} the project.

5|$|Whale {{morphology}} shows {{a number}} of examples of convergent evolution, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> being the streamlined fish-like body shape. Other examples {{include the use of}} echolocation for hunting in low light conditions— which is the same hearing adaptation used by bats— and, in the rorqual whales, jaw adaptations, similar to those found in pelicans, that enable engulfment feeding.|$|E
5|$|In autumn and winter, the {{extensive}} flood plain of the Shannon Callows supports {{a large number}} of waders, swans, wildfowl and other bird life. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> of all Shannon birds is the mute swan. Also seen are the coot, moorhen and little grebe (or dabchick). The kingfisher is widespread as are the meadow pipit and pied wagtail. The area has one of the largest concentrations of breeding waders in Ireland including lapwing, redshank, sandpiper and godwit.|$|E
5|$|While the {{traprock}} cliffs remain <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> {{evidence of}} the prehistoric geologic processes of the Metacomet Ridge, the sedimentary rock of the ridge and surrounding terrain has produced equally significant evidence of prehistoric life {{in the form of}} Triassic and Jurassic fossils; in particular, dinosaur tracks. At a state park in Rocky Hill, Connecticut, more than 2,000 well preserved early Jurassic prints have been excavated. Other sites in Holyoke and Greenfield have likewise produced significant finds.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the nobility}} {{there were many}} educated and cultured women, of which Queen Mary is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> example. By the early eighteenth century their {{education}} was expected to include basic literacy and numeracy, musical instruments (including lute, viol and keyboard), needlework, cookery and household management, while polite accomplishments and piety were also emphasised. From the seventeenth century they were some notable aristocratic female writers. The first book written by a woman and published in Scotland was Elizabeth Melville's Ane Godlie Dreame in 1603. Later major figures included Lady Elizabeth Wardlaw (1627–1727) and Lady Grizel Baillie (1645–1746). There are 50 autobiographies extant from the late seventeenth to the early eighteenth century, of which 16 were written by women, {{all of which are}} largely religious in content.|$|E
5|$|Each module {{was fitted}} with {{external}} components {{specific to the}} experiments that were carried out within that module, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> being the Travers antenna mounted to Priroda. This synthetic aperture radar consisted of a large dish-like framework mounted outside the module, with associated equipment within, used for Earth observations experiments, as was {{most of the other}} equipment on Priroda, including various radiometers and scan platforms. Kvant-2 also featured several scan platforms and was fitted with a mounting bracket to which the cosmonaut manoeuvring unit, or Ikar, was mated. This backpack was designed to assist cosmonauts in moving around the station and the planned Buran {{in a manner similar to}} the US Manned Maneuvering Unit, but it was only used once, during EO-5.|$|E
5|$|El Toro {{has several}} {{similarities}} to Viper, the coaster that it replaced. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> similarity is that El Toro uses Viper's station, {{the only part}} of Viper that was not torn down. The station previously held two Viper trains at once, with a loading platform in the front and an unloading platform in the rear. The ramp that was previously Viper's main exit is now used only for wheelchair access, as El Toro has a new exit {{on the other side of}} the station. During El Toro's construction, the station was gutted and an entirely new platform built. Like El Toro, Viper turned left out of the station before the lift hill and turned left at the top of the lift before the first drop.|$|E

5|$|GameSpot and GameSpy {{called the}} dialog sharply written, with many memorable lines. Eurogamer {{noted that the}} characters' {{frequent}} use of vulgar language worked; written as real people, such language fit their character rather than giving the game an adult veneer. The website appreciated the breadth of dialog options, allowing the player greater control of how to play their character. PC Zone opined that the quantity of well-written dialog did not guarantee quality; many player choices seemed to have little effect on a conversation's outcome, and the best response was often <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>obvious.</b> The voice acting was repeatedly praised for the actors' quality {{and the amount of}} voice work, due to the many dialog options.|$|E
5|$|Georgia's defense {{managed a}} strong {{performance}} statistically and in real terms. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> {{examples of this}} were the threeinterceptions and one forced fumble {{that proved to be}} the turning point in the game. Two of the interceptions were caught by linebacker Tony Taylor, who also had ninetackles, two for a loss of yards. The tackles tied him with Paul Oliver, who also had nine. The third interception came from Kelin Johnson, while the fumble was forced by Charles Johnson. Johnson had an active day as well. In addition to the forced fumble, he recorded fourtackles, twosacks, and a passbreak-up.|$|E
5|$|Inappropriate {{handling}} {{in rough}} weather was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> cause for Kronans sinking. Unlike Vasa, Kronans sailing characteristics were not inherently flawed {{and the ship}} had served for several years in rough seas. During {{the work of the}} commission, artillery officer Anders Gyllenspak even made direct comparisons to Vasa. He testified that Kronans ballast had been lightened at Dalarö {{at the beginning of the}} campaign and that she had not replenished her supply of drink, so that the ship had a shallower draft and would have been somewhat less stable than with full stores, though he did not blame this on Creutz.|$|E

5|$|Kristall {{contained}} furnaces for use {{in producing}} crystals under microgravity conditions (hence the choice of name for the module). The module was also equipped with biotechnology research equipment, including a small greenhouse for plant cultivation experiments which was equipped with a source of light and a feeding system, in addition to equipment for astronomical observations. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> features of the module were the two Androgynous Peripheral Attach System (APAS-89) docking ports designed to be compatible with the Buran spacecraft. Although they were never used in a Buran docking, they were useful later during the Shuttle-Mir programme, providing a berthing location for US Space Shuttles.|$|E
5|$|Pleuronectiformes (flatfish) are {{an order}} of ray-finned fish. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> {{characteristic}} of the modern flatfish is their asymmetry, with both eyes {{on the same side}} of the head in the adult fish. In some families the eyes are always on the right side of the body (dextral or right-eyed flatfish) and in others they are always on the left (sinistral or left-eyed flatfish). The primitive spiny turbots include equal numbers of right- and left-eyed individuals, and are generally less asymmetrical than the other families. Other distinguishing features of the order are the presence of protrusible eyes, another adaptation to living on the seabed (benthos), and the extension of the dorsal fin onto the head.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises are a {{group of}} fully aquatic marine mammals that are {{sometimes}} referred to as mereswine, all of which are classified under the family Phocoenidae, parvorder Odontoceti (toothed whales). There are six extant species of porpoise. They are small toothed whales that are very closely related to oceanic dolphins. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> visible {{difference between the two groups}} is that porpoises have shorter beaks and flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. Porpoises, and other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged from them about 40 million years ago.|$|E
