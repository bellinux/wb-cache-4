5|$|Bryant's career did not recover. She {{attempted}} to stage comebacks in Eureka Springs, Arkansas in 1992, Branson, Missouri in 1994 ("People {{who come to}} my performances are hungry for the truth. They <b>thank</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> reminding them {{of the importance of}} God and country."), and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee in 1997. However, at each venue her audiences dwindled and investors were non-existent. By 2002, Bryant and her second husband Charlie Dry had claimed bankruptcy in three states. As of 2006 Bryant was living in Oklahoma City.|$|E
500|$|In February 2013 his agent, Terry Baker, told BBC Radio 5 Live that Gascoigne had relapsed again: [...] "He won't <b>thank</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> {{saying it}} but he {{immediately}} {{needs to get}} help... His life is always in danger because he is an alcoholic. Maybe no one can save him – I don't know. I really don't know." [...] Gascoigne was placed in intensive care in a US hospital while being treated for alcoholism in Arizona in a rehabilitation programme thanks to financial support provided by ex-cricketer Ronnie Irani and broadcaster Chris Evans. He was arrested for assaulting a railway security guard and being drunk and disorderly at Stevenage railway station on 4 July 2013; he was fined £1,000 after admitting the offence, and ordered to pay £100 compensation to the guard.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Freedom" [...] is a hip hop and R {{song that}} follows a similar style to other Minaj songs heard on her debut album, Pink Friday. The song {{features}} street-slang bravado and [...] "venomous" [...] rapping in the verses with thin, fragile vocals over whipsy soft pop choruses. The instrumentation in [...] "Freedom" [...] mixes together smooth ambient riffs, pop-inspired crystal-clear synthesizers, and a smooth R beat, creating a sonically breezy soundscape. Lyrically, Minaj is still confrontational yet reflective, {{talking about her}} life in the spotlight and rise to fame. In the lyrics, Minaj states how other rappers [...] "in the competition" [...] will never thank her for opening the doors for them, and how they don't even thank their creator Jesus Christ for helping them get far, saying: [...] "They'll never <b>thank</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> opening doors / But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross / 'Cause your spirit is ungrateful, bitches is so hateful, I remain a staple." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many {{parents have}} since stopped {{me on the}} street or in {{airports}} to <b>thank</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> helping them to raise fine children, and they've often added, [...] "I don't see any instant gratification in Baby and Child Care" [...] I answer that they're right--I've always advised parents to give their children firm, clear leadership and to ask for cooperation and politeness in return. On the other hand I've also received letters from conservative mothers saying, in effect, [...] "Thank God I've never used your horrible book. That's why my children take baths, wear clean clothes and get good grades in school." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{resulted}} in the Education Reform Act 1990 (NSW) (now the Education Act 1990). Prior to its assent on 1 June 1990, school education in New South Wales had been provided under a law developed 110 years earlier by Henry Parkes and William Wilkins in their [...] "Public Instruction Act 1880 (NSW)". On {{the significance of this}} law, Metherell said in early 1990: [...] "Chifley in his time was thought of as somewhat of an ogre, but now when we look back on Ben Chifley we reflect upon his statesmanship. People will eventually <b>thank</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> these reforms - this is a blueprint for education into the 21st century".|$|E
2500|$|The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation {{called upon}} Hilton to {{apologize}} for using an anti-gay slur against will.i.am during the incident, saying [...] "We have reached out to Hilton {{and asked him to}} apologize [...] [...] [...] and we would ask media outlets to avoid repetition of the slur in their coverage of this story." [...] Hilton initially refused to apologize, saying, [...] "I am saddened GLAAD chose to victimize me further by criticizing me for how I non-violently dealt with a very scary situation that, unfortunately, turned violent." [...] On June 25, 2009, however, Hilton did apologize, stating [...] "I am NOT apologizing to GLAAD...I am apologizing to the gay community, to anyone who was hurt by my choice of words, and to all the people who have ever emailed me to <b>thank</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> all that I have done to fight for gay rights over the last few years." [...] In addition, he pledged to donate any money won in the lawsuit against Molina to the Matthew Shepard Foundation. In a statement released on its website, Judy Shepard, Chair of the MSF, declined the gift, saying that [...] "because the lawsuit presumably involves the physical attack prompted by Mr. Hilton's admitted use of an anti-gay slur, the Foundation will be unable to accept any funds obtained in such a manner." ...|$|E
