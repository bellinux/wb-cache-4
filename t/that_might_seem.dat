5|$|On average, {{the light}} that Gliese 581d {{receives}} from its star has about 30% of the intensity of light the Earth receives from the Sun. By comparison, sunlight on Mars has about 40% of the intensity of that on Earth. <b>That</b> <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> to suggest that Gliese 581d is too cold to support liquid water and hence is inhospitable to life. However, an atmospheric greenhouse effect can significantly raise planetary temperatures. For example, Earth's own mean temperature would be about −18°C without any greenhouse gases, ranging from around 100°C on the day side to −150°C at night, much like that found on the Moon. If the atmosphere of Gliese 581d produces a sufficiently large greenhouse effect, and the planet's geophysics stabilize the CO2 levels (as Earth's does via plate tectonics), then the surface temperature might permit a liquid water cycle, conceivably allowing the planet to support life. Calculations by Barnes et al. suggest, however, that tidal heating is too low to keep plate tectonics active on the planet, unless radiogenic heating is somewhat higher than expected.|$|E
25|$|According to Zbigniew Dumienski, {{the very}} concept of human {{trafficking}} is murky and misleading. It has been argued that while human trafficking is commonly seen as a monolithic crime, in reality it is an act of illegal migration that involves various different actions: some of them may be criminal or abusive, but others often involve consent and are legal. Laura Agustin argues that not everything <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> abusive or coercive is considered as such by the migrant. For instance, she states that: 'would-be travellers commonly seek help from intermediaries who sell information, services and documents. When travellers cannot afford to buy these outright, they go into debt'. Dumienski says that while these debts might indeed be on very harsh conditions, they are usually incurred on a voluntary basis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{movement}} combines disparate {{people and}} ideas <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> incompatible in another context.

2500|$|Decided by the US Supreme Court in 2002 {{this case}} [...] held that even {{requests}} for accommodation <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> reasonable on their face, e.g., a {{transfer to a}} different position, can be rendered unreasonable because it would require {{a violation of the}} company's seniority system. [...] While the court held that in general a violation of a seniority system renders an otherwise reasonable accommodation unreasonable a plaintiff can present evidence that despite the seniority system the accommodation is reasonable in the specific case at hand, e.g., the plaintiff could offer evidence that the seniority system is so often disregarded that another exception wouldn't make a difference.|$|E
2500|$|Nicknames (t, s, chuòhào, or , wàihào) are {{acquired}} in China {{in much the}} same way they are in other countries. Not everyone has one. Most that do received theirs in childhood or adolescence from family or friends. Common Chinese nicknames are those based on a person's physical attributes, speaking style, or behavior. Names involving animals are common, although those animals may be associated with different attributes than they are in English: for example, Chinese cows are strong, not stupid; foxes are devious, not clever; pigs are ugly, lazy, stupid, or content, but not dirty. Similarly, nicknames <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> especially insulting in English—such as [...] "Little Fatty" [...] (...) —are more acceptable in Chinese. One especially common method of creating nicknames is prefixing Ā- (...) or Xiǎo (...) to the surname or the second character of the given name. Ā- is more common in southern China and abroad, while Xiǎo is common throughout China. Both Ā- and Xiǎo are distinguished from Lǎo ( [...] , [...] "old" [...] but see below for usage). Nicknames are rarely used in formal or semi-formal settings, although a famous exception is A-bian.|$|E
2500|$|Paxes with {{elaborate}} metalwork framing an image {{in a medium}} that would withstand kissing and wiping are the sort that have been most likely to survive. Other objects <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> to have had another purpose, such as plaquettes, ivory panels or small painted enamel plaques, may have been made for a pax. [...] Equally other objects began life as serving some other purpose, and were turned into paxes. Some still have a metal fitting at the rear, either a handle or a slot for a long wooden handle to fit into (a few of these survive). Glass or rock crystal over an image below allowed the image to be kissed repeatedly but not damaged, and enamel also wore relatively well. [...] Carved shell and mother of pearl are sometimes used. [...] Even with a frame paxes are usually less than a foot high, and the images often 4 to 6 inches high. [...] The inventory of the royal treasure of King Richard II of England lists many paxes among its nearly 1,200 items, including two of plain ungilded silver with red crosses, which Jenny Stratford suggests were for use in Lent. [...] Several record who gave them, or from whom they were seized for offences.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave [...] "We Dance On" [...] a {{four out}} of five rating. He felt that when N-Dubz teamed up with Bodyrox for their soundtrack {{contribution}} to StreetDance 3D, they clearly took on board what the film was all about: overcoming prejudices and, the merging of diverse styles of music and dance. Copsey said, [...] "Much like the film itself, 'We Dance On' features an assortment of different influences <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> contradictory on paper, but inevitably work out for the best in the end." [...] He noted that the verses about pursuing your dreams like a [...] "fox on a mission" [...] and [...] "the big, Bob Marley-inspired chorus – [...] "I know everything's gonna be alright/Now you're standing here by my side" [...] will surely tug at the heartstrings of the song's listener. Copsey {{went on to say that}} the track [...] "leaves you feeling warm, fuzzy and [...] better inside." [...] BBCs Fraser McAlpine felt that [...] "We Dance On" [...] was capable of bringing its listener to tears with, [...] "massive churning string section" [...] from Johann Pachelbel's [...] "Canon in D Major" [...] and few [...] "everything's gonna be alright" [...] chants. McAlpine noted that the string section contains influences from The Farm's [...] "All Together Now" [...] (1990). He went on to interpret the song's chants as being inspired by Bob Marley's [...] "No Woman, No Cry" [...] (1974). Gavin Martin of the Daily Mirror gave [...] "We Dance On" [...] three out of five stars in his review of the single. He highlighted Tulisa Contostavlos' contribution in the song, saying: [...] "Often forced to take a back seat while her male counterparts lead, N-Dubz' front lady Tulisa comes out front for this". Martin went on to describe the song as a [...] "crowd-pleasing and unifying floor filler with a hint of classical spice." ...|$|E
