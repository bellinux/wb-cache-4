5|$|A. Bjarne Riis has {{admitted}} to doping during the 1996 Tour de France. The {{organizers of the}} Tour de France have stated that <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer consider {{him to be the}} winner, although Union Cycliste Internationale has so far refused to change the official status due to the amount of time passed since his win. Jan Ullrich was placed second on the podium in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Campbell died in 1971 {{at the age}} of 61 in Mountainside, New Jersey. At {{the time}} of his sudden death after 34 years at the helm of Analog, Campbell's quirky {{personality}} and eccentric editorial demands had alienated a number of his most illustrious writers to the point that <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer submitted works to him.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of International Velvet, and the heavy touring that followed, the band were pleased {{to return to the}} Monnow Valley Studio to record a third studio album. On the {{recommendation}} of TommyD, the band had been recording sample tracks onto a DPS12 hard disk recorder in their tour bus while on an American tour and they returned to Monnow Valley to record them properly. The band felt less pressure on them for the new album, due to {{the success of}} International Velvet and because <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer feared being dropped by the label.|$|E

5|$|Notable {{businesses}} that started accepting Octopus cards {{at a very}} early stage include PARKnSHOP, Wellcome, Watsons, 7-Eleven, Starbucks, McDonald's, and Circle K. As of 21 November 2004, all parking meters in Hong Kong were converted. <b>They</b> <b>no</b> longer accept coins and Octopus became the only form of payment accepted.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{from the}} release of Stage 2, changes {{were made to the}} hunter classes. Every class now {{possesses}} the ability to deploy a force field, an ability once exclusive to the Trapper class. It can be used to limit the Monster's movement to a small area. The ability's cooldown time decreases when the hunters deal enough damage to the monster. Starting from Stage 2, the health of all hunters regenerate if they manage to avoid damage, and <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer have to rely on the Medic class.|$|E
5|$|The 42nd Infantry Division Murska and Detachment Ormozki {{were cut}} off north of Zagreb, and those {{elements}} that did not disperse to their homes withdrew into the Ivanšćica and Kalnik mountains. Leaders of a Slovene nationalist movement announced that <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer recognised the Yugoslav government, and began to call for Slovene soldiers to cease fighting and return home, compounding the effect of Ustaše propaganda on Croat military personnel and accelerating the disintegration of Yugoslav forces.|$|E
5000|$|Another speech {{included}} the following: They were faithful and true to you then; <b>they</b> are <b>no</b> less so today. And yet <b>they</b> ask <b>no</b> special favors as a class; <b>they</b> ask <b>no</b> special protection as a race. They {{feel that they}} purchased their inheritance, when upon the battlefields of this country, they watered the tree of liberty with the precious blood that flowed from their loyal veins. <b>They</b> ask <b>no</b> favors, <b>they</b> desire; and must have; an equal chance in the race of life.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Rishi Sufis {{were focused}} on seclusion and emphasis on meditation. In his memoirs, Jahangir says that [...] "though <b>they</b> have <b>no</b> religious knowledge or learning of any sort, yet they possess simplicity and are without pretence. <b>They</b> abuse <b>no</b> one. <b>They</b> restrain the tongue of desire and the foot of seeking. <b>They</b> eat <b>no</b> flesh, <b>they</b> have <b>no</b> wives and always plant fruit bearing trees in the fields so that men may benefit by them, themselves desiring no advantage. There are about 2,000 of these people." ...|$|R

5|$|The Optimize system section {{includes}} TuneUp Program Deactivator, which unloads {{programs from}} memory and prevents their further automatic execution, {{an alternative to}} uninstalling them. While disabled programs continue to consume disk space, <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer affect the startup time, the shutdown time and the system performance. Other components include a defragmentation tool, a registry cleaner, and a startup manager to replace MSConfig.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} N. J. Higham {{speculates that}} Gregory had {{originally intended to}} send the British slave boys as missionaries, until in 596 he received news that Liudhard had died, thus opening the way for more serious missionary activity. Higham argues {{that it was the}} lack of any bishop in Britain which allowed Gregory to send Augustine, with orders to be consecrated as a bishop if needed. Another consideration was that cooperation would be more easily obtained from the Frankish royal courts if <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer had their own bishop and agent in place.|$|E
5|$|The plan {{itself is}} not without controversy, as it has made the local club Kingstonian F.C.'s future very uncertain, with them unable {{to play in a}} ground that is now too big and {{expensive}} for a non-league side and one which <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer have any decision over.|$|E

5|$|The third disc from Integral was {{released}} as a stand-alone game in North America {{under the title}} of Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions on September 23, 1999. While the content of VR Missions are virtually identical to Integrals VR Disc, the unlocking requirements for the Ninja missions and the photoshoot mode were changed accordingly so that <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer required save data from the main game or any use of the PocketStation.|$|E
5|$|Thorkildsen's {{relationship}} with the Norwegian hurdler Christina Vukicevic generated some unwanted publicity on his part. When Thorkildsen and Vukicevic won the King's Cup {{for men and women}} respectively at the 2006 Norwegian championships, Thorkildsen left the stadium to avoid photographers, whom he had shown the finger the previous day. In March 2011 Vukicevic and Thorkildsen announced in the Norwegian media that <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer were a couple.|$|E
5|$|As Germany's {{military}} and economic situation grew steadily worse, on 25 August 1943 Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler took over the post of interior minister, replacing Wilhelm Frick. Intensive air raids on Berlin and other cities took {{the lives of thousands}} of people. Göring's Luftwaffe attempted to retaliate with air raids on London in early 1944, but <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer had sufficient aircraft to make much of an impact. While Goebbels' propaganda in this period indicated that a huge retaliation was in the offing, the V-1 flying bombs, launched on British targets beginning in mid-June 1944, had little effect, with only around 20 per cent reaching their intended targets. To boost morale, Goebbels continued to publish propaganda to the effect that further improvements to these weapons would have a decisive impact on the outcome of the war. Meanwhile, in the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944, the Allies successfully gained a foothold in France.|$|E

5|$|At 11:00 the {{security}} situation at the Air America compound was deteriorating as General Carey {{did not wish to}} risk his Marines by extending his perimeter to cover the Air America compound (LZ 40), so all Air America helicopters from this time operated out of the tennis courts in the DAO Annex (LZ 35). This move created fuel problems for Air America as <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer had access to the fuel supplies in their compound and at least initially they were refused fuel by the ships of TF76. According to US Naval Archives, at 12:30 an Air America Bell 205 landed Air Vice Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, Madame Kỳ, Dorothy Martin (wife of Ambassador Martin) and others on the USS Denver; contemporary reports state and photos show that Marshal Kỳ piloted his own UH-1H Huey to the USS Midway.|$|E
5|$|In May 1942, Gens secured German {{permission}} for {{residents of the}} ghetto to sell belongings or property they left with gentiles outside the ghetto. The proceeds were to be split half and half between the Jewish owners and the Germans. In practice, the Germans often kept {{more than half the}} value, but it still allowed ghetto residents to receive some value for property <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer controlled. Then in October 1942, the Germans allowed the Jewish ghetto police to retrieve Jewish property left with others outside the ghetto and bring it back to the ghetto. In the same month Gens set up a program to collect, repair, and redistribute winter clothing. The clothes were donated by ghetto residents, repaired in workshops in the ghetto, and then given to the poor and needy. The effort was credited with helping many of the poorest residents survive the winter of 1942–1943.|$|E
5|$|In late 1999, Runnels {{arranged}} the Terri Invitational Tournament, a best-of-five series, between Edge and Christian and The Hardy Boyz, with the winner receiving her managerial {{services and the}} sum of $100,000. The Hardy Boyz won the tournament, which culminated in a ladder match at No Mercy (with the prize money suspended above the ring in a bag). Runnels spent {{the next few months}} as their manager until she was injured when Bubba Ray Dudley powerbombed her through a table. She returned on February 27 at No Way Out and cost the Hardy Boyz a match. She then became the manager of Edge and Christian, and the storyline originally called for her to come between the duo, resulting in them becoming singles wrestlers with Runnels managing Christian. The storyline, however, was rewritten, and on an episode of SmackDown!, Edge and Christian—who would now continue wrestling as a tag team—revealed <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer wanted Runnels's services. She, therefore, slapped Edge, who responded by spearing her.|$|E
5000|$|Watson {{has said}} the [...] "double hook" [...] of her title refers to the idea “that when you fish for the glory you catch the {{darkness}} too. That if you hook twice the glory you hook twice the fear.” She explained that her novel is [...] "about how people are driven, how if <b>they</b> have <b>no</b> art, how if <b>they</b> have <b>no</b> tradition, how if <b>they</b> have <b>no</b> ritual, <b>they</b> are driven in one of 2 ways, either towards violence or towards insensibility - if <b>they</b> have <b>no</b> mediating rituals which manifest themselves in what I suppose we call art forms." ...|$|R

5|$|It {{is unknown}} how much support there was for {{persecution}} within the aristocracy. After Gallienus's peace, Christians reached high ranks in Roman government. Diocletian appointed several Christians to those positions himself, {{and his wife}} and daughter may have been sympathetic to the church. There were many individuals willing to be martyrs, and many provincials willing to ignore any persecutory edicts from the emperors as well. Even Constantius was known to have disapproved of persecutory policies. The lower classes demonstrated little of the enthusiasm they had shown for earlier persecutions. <b>They</b> <b>no</b> longer believed the slanderous accusations that were popular in the 1st and 2nd centuries. Perhaps, as the historian Timothy Barnes has suggested, the long-established Church had become another accepted part of their lives.|$|E
5|$|Madzimbamuto petitioned for {{the right}} to appeal against his {{detention}} to the Privy Council in London; the Rhodesian Appellate Division ruled that he had no right to do so, but the Privy Council considered his case anyway. It ruled in his favour on 23 July 1968, deciding that orders for detention made by the Rhodesian government were invalid regardless of whether they were under the 1961 or 1965 constitution, and that Madzimbamuto was illegally detained. Harry Elinder Davies, one of the Rhodesian judges, announced on 8 August that the Rhodesian courts would not consider this ruling binding as <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer accepted the Privy Council as part of the Rhodesian judicial hierarchy. Justice JR Dendy Young resigned in protest at Davies's ruling on 12 August and four days later became Chief Justice of Botswana. Madzimbamuto would remain in prison until 1974.|$|E
5|$|Manning explores {{these themes}} {{not only in}} her major novels set in Europe and the Middle East, but also in her Irish fiction, The Wind Changes (1937) and eight short stories which were mostly written early in her career. In these works, {{colonialist}} attitudes are reproduced by Manning's stereotyping of Catholic southerners as wild, primitive and undisciplined, while northerners live lives of well-ordered efficiency. Displaced principal characters struggle to find their place in social groups whose values <b>they</b> <b>no</b> longer accept. Manning has also been noted for her direct and early focus {{on the impact of}} the end of colonial rule. The Rain Forest (1974) presents a later, highly pessimistic view, satirising British expatriate values on a fictional island. It also critiques those involved in the independence movement, expressing a disillusioned view of the island's future post-independence prospects.|$|E

Most importantly, they lack a self-consciousness or even the possibility to become conscious of their own existence. <b>They</b> have <b>no</b> subjective claim to life, as their feelings are just simple elemental ones such as {{those found in the}} lower animals.|$|R
