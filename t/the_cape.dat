5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cape</b> sparrow {{was first}} {{described}} by Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller in 1776, as Loxia melanura. Some other earlier biologists described <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> sparrow in Loxia or Fringilla, {{but it has}} otherwise been regarded {{as a member of}} the genus Passer along with the house sparrow and other sparrows of the Old World. Within this genus, morphological comparisons and geography were insufficient to elucidate to which species <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> sparrow is most closely related. Mitochondrial DNA phylogenies have strongly suggested that <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> sparrow is among the most basal members of its genus, having diverged from the rest of the genus during the late Miocene, over 5million years ago. It is genetically closest to the southern grey-headed sparrow and the other grey-headed sparrows of Africa and the saxaul sparrow of Central Asia, so these species may be sibling species of <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> sparrow or similarly early offshoots.|$|E
5|$|The Invasion of <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> Colony was a British {{military}} expedition {{launched in}} 1795 against the Dutch Cape Colony at <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> of Good Hope, {{the southern tip}} of Southern Africa. The Dutch colony at <b>the</b> <b>Cape,</b> established in the seventeenth century, was at the time the only viable South African port for ships making the journey from Europe to the European colonies in the East Indies. It therefore held vital strategic importance, although it was otherwise economically insignificant. In the winter of 1794, during the French Revolutionary Wars, French troops entered the Dutch Republic, which was reformed into the Batavian Republic. In response, Great Britain launched operations against the Dutch Empire to use its facilities against the French Navy.|$|E

5|$|After {{taking on}} {{supplies}} at Las Palmas, Lucas sailed to Praia on Cape Verde, before continuing south on 29 May {{in the direction}} of the Brazilian coast, hoping to profit from favourable winds and currents. In fact, due to persistent calms, a position off the Brazilian shore was only reached on 27 June. Because of the delay, Lucas decided not to supply himself but to sail directly to <b>the</b> <b>Cape.</b> Because Lucas made no stops on his journey between Cape Verde and <b>the</b> <b>Cape,</b> the fact that his voyage took far longer than a journey of this distance should have taken has surprised several authors. Historian C. Northcote Parkinson ascribed the delay, at least partially, to the poor quality of seamanship among Lucas's crews. The Batavian expeditionary force did not speak to another vessel during this time and thus had no information regarding British dispositions when it eventually reached <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> on 26 July. They first reconnoitred Saldanha Bay, then Table Bay to the south, and eventually on 6 August they anchored in Saldanha Bay.|$|E

5|$|Batavian {{control of}} the Dutch Cape Colony was a serious risk to British {{shipping}} rounding <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> of Good Hope, and a substantial force under Sir George Keith Elphinstone was sent from Britain to eliminate it. Arriving in early August, Elphinstone initially attempted to intimidate the governor into surrender, but eventually authorised a landing at Simon's Town. On 7 August the expeditionary force fought a skirmish at Muizenberg and clashes continued throughout August. A major Dutch attack on 3 September was forestalled {{by the arrival of}} a large fleet of Indiamen carrying British reinforcements, and as these troops came ashore the outnumbered Dutch surrendered.
