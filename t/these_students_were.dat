Education policies in Australia do not recognise that <b>students</b> can <b>be</b> both academically gifted and have a learning disability.

This style of monasticism allowed for the monastery to connect with, and become a part of, the community at large.

2500|$|With the first-year {{students}} enrolled in the 2006–2007 school year, Grinnell has ended its need-blind admissions policy for international applicants. Under the old policy, students from countries outside the U.S. were admitted without any consideration of their ability to afford four years of study at the college. However, financial aid offers to <b>these</b> <b>students</b> <b>were</b> limited to half the cost of tuition. International students frequently carried very high workloads in an effort to pay the bills, and their academic performance often suffered. Under the new [...] "need-sensitive" [...] or [...] "need-aware" [...] policy, international students whose demonstrated financial needs can be met are given a slight admissions edge over applicants who can't. The twin hopes are that the enrolled international students will be able to dedicate more energy to their schoolwork, and also that this will ultimately allow the college to provide higher tuition grants to international students.|$|E
