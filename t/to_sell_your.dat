As this is {{absolute}} oppression, if I were a bookseller in this town, I would use all the safe means to reprint London books, and run them to any town in England, that I could, because whoever offends not the laws of God, or the country he lives in, commits no sin.... But I am so incensed against the oppresions from England, and have so little regard to the laws they make, that I do, as a clergyman, encourage the merchants both to export wool and woollen manufactures to any country in Europe, or anywhere else, and conceal it from the Custom-house officers, as I would hide my purse from a highwayman, if he came to rob me on the road, although England hath made a law to the contrary; and so I would encourage our booksellers here <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>your</b> author's books printed here, and send them to all the towns in England, if I could do it with safety and profit; because I repeat, it is no offence against God, or the laws of the country I live in.|$|E

5000|$|The {{debate on}} the ethics and {{morality}} of organ trade remains spirited in modern society. Relevant evidence changes frequently due to the dynamic nature of our technological advancements in medicine and our understanding of ethics itself. [...] At the moment, although organ trade is illegal in almost all countries, it is still difficult to provide a solid conclusion {{in the field of}} business ethics without a bias based on one's basic beliefs, culture, or religion. Particularly, religion {{plays a major role in}} the topic of bodily autonomy as it relates to organ trade. Bodily autonomy is defined as the [...] "ability to make choices about how one's body is to be treated by others." [...] Many religious activists and theorists say this idea of bodily autonomy treats the body as property, which violates many religious views that the body and self are one entity. Therefore, from many religious stances, selling a part of your body is analogous <b>to</b> <b>selling</b> <b>your</b> inner self, or soul, which many religious communities regard as a violation of human dignity.|$|R
