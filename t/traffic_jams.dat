5|$|As {{traffic levels}} increased, {{bottlenecks}} at the two-lane tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{became a major}} problem. By the late 1950s, <b>traffic</b> <b>jams</b> formed at the tunnels, especially during the summer. In 1959, four Senators urged state officials {{to work with the}} turnpike commission to study ways to reduce the <b>traffic</b> <b>jams.</b> That year, the commission began studies aimed at resolving the <b>traffic</b> <b>jams</b> at the Laurel Hill and Allegheny Mountain tunnels; studies for the other tunnels followed. At the conclusion of the studies, the turnpike commission planned to make the entire turnpike four lanes by either adding a second tube at the tunnels or bypassing them. The new and upgraded tunnel tubes would feature white tiles, fluorescent lighting, and upgraded ventilation.|$|E
5|$|The {{congestion}} tax {{is being}} introduced at the access and exit ramps of two interchanges on Essingeleden {{in order to}} reduce <b>traffic</b> <b>jams</b> in peak periods, and with shorter <b>traffic</b> <b>jams</b> on Essingeleden, the surrounding roads are expected to have shorter tailbacks. The transport agencies involved expected to reduce traffic on Essingeleden by some 10% in peak hours. One week after the tax began to be charged, traffic on the motorway had decreased by 22% compared to a normal day in mid-December.|$|E

5|$|Heat {{waves are}} a common feature of summers in the city. These heat waves place extra demand on {{electricity}} usage, leading to shortages. In extreme cases, these power shortages during heat waves can cause <b>traffic</b> <b>jams</b> and protests, such as the December 2013 heat wave (longest heat wave ever recorded in Buenos Aires) where increased energy demand lead to energy shortages and power cuts, protests against the government over the lack of service, and <b>traffic</b> <b>jams</b> {{as a result of}} these protests. However, most heat waves are of short duration (usually less than a week), and are followed by the passage of the cold, dry Pampero wind, which brings violent and intense thunderstorms with strong gusts and hail followed by cooler temperatures and lower humidity. Occasionally, a tornado can form, which can strike the city although most tornadoes are relatively weak and rarely cause deaths. The greatest risk for tornadoes occurs in the summer season due to the favourable conditions. These severe storms can damage cars, houses and disrupt public services such as transportation and collection and disposal of urban solid waste.|$|E
5|$|The Sibu Night Market was {{established}} in 1973. It was situated in the town centre. Local traders will usually set up their mobile stalls from 5pm to 10pm every day.

In August 2012, the market was relocated to Butterfly Garden at Cross Road near the Tua Pek Kong Temple to ease <b>traffic</b> <b>jams.</b>|$|E

As {{recreational}} use of Fossil Creek increased after 2008, accumulations of trash and human waste as well as damage to forests and stream banks became problematic. The Forest Service at times closes parts of Forest Road 708 (Fossil Creek Road) to limit danger from <b>traffic</b> <b>jams.</b> Campfires are prohibited between the Fossil Creek headwaters and the dry bed of Stehr Lake, and other restrictions apply.

5|$|The {{crossing}} {{is problematic}} because passing freight trains often result in delays both on Route 126, {{as well as}} Route 135 which crosses it {{just south of the}} tracks. The frequent blockage of the crossing by passing trains reduces capacity in the intersection by 21% during the morning rush and 16% in the afternoon, resulting in delays and <b>traffic</b> <b>jams</b> in the downtown area. Increased service levels planned by the MBTA would result in morning capacity reduction of 34% and afternoon reduction of 28%.|$|E
5|$|The crucial factor which {{frustrated}} firefighting efforts was the narrowness of the streets.

The changes were expected to be complete by 2011, as part of improvements to convert the Route17 expressway into I-86. However, in 2009 they were postponed due to funding constraints. Work was slated to begin in 2013, but just before it could start Governor Andrew Cuomo redirected the money to repair projects elsewhere in the state. The project was put on indefinite hold in 2014 until it could be funded.|$|E

Starting on November25, turnpike management personnel collected flat-rate passenger tolls of $2 and commercial tolls of $15 from cash customers on the ticketed system, while E-ZPass customers were charged the lesser of the actual toll or the same flat rates. The strike ended after seven days when both sides reached an agreement on November30. Normal toll collection resumed December1.|$|E

The division advanced towards the canal, but movement was hampered by the massive <b>traffic</b> <b>jams</b> on the roads leading to the canal. When Adan realized that Akavish was closed, he ordered a tank battalion to make a turning maneuver through the desert to reach Deversoir. When it arrived, Sharon contacted Adan, explaining Reshef's difficult situation, and requested that the battalion be placed under his command. Adan accepted, and Sharon in turn authorized Reshef's request to pull back and regroup, replacing his brigade with the tank battalion.|$|E
5|$|The British 3rd Infantry Division, of I Corps, came ashore on Sword {{beach on}} 6 June 1944, with Caen— inland—as their final objective. The {{vicinity}} of Caen was attractive to Allied planners because it contained airfields and was open, dry and conducive to swift offensive operations, {{for which the}} Allies {{had the advantage of}} numerical superiority in tanks and mobile units. The attempt to capture Caen on D-Day was ambitious and <b>traffic</b> <b>jams</b> on the beaches delayed the 27th Armoured Brigade. The advance of the 3rd Infantry Division diminished as it fought past German fortifications and was stopped short of Caen before dark, by elements of the 21st Panzer Division.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} circles, or roundabouts, that span and connect west Amman. Successive waves of {{immigrants}} to the city {{has led to the}} rapid construction of new neighborhoods, but Amman's capacity for new or widened roads remains limited despite the influx. This has resulted in increasing <b>traffic</b> <b>jams,</b> particularly during summer when there are large numbers of tourists and Jordanian expatriates visiting. The municipality began construction on a bus rapid transit (BRT) system as a solution in 2015. In 2015, a ring road encompassing the city was constructed, which aims to connect the northern and southern parts of the city in order for traffic to be diverted outside Amman and to improve the environmental conditions in the city.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a decentralized control problem for suppressing the <b>traffic</b> <b>jam</b> in a cyclic traffic flow. In recent years, {{to explain the}} mechanism that causes the <b>traffic</b> <b>jam,</b> several experiments have been done for multiple vehicles on the circle. The <b>traffic</b> <b>jam</b> {{can be explained by}} the so-called optimal velocity model, the optimal velocity function which is a nonlinear function of the headway of the preceding vehicle and describes driver's characteristics. In this paper, we apply washout control to suppress the <b>traffic</b> <b>jam</b> in a cyclic traffic flow not to disturb driver's characteristics. Then, we show a method to select parameters to keep stability of the closed-loop system. We find that our proposed method for selecting parameters is better than the conservative method using the small gain theorem. In addition, we illustrate the effectiveness with several simulations. © 2011 IFAC...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we present}} an {{interactive}} system for visual analysis of urban traffic congestion based on GPS trajectories.
