5|$|Climate is the {{statistics}} of weather {{over long periods}} of time. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region {{over long periods of}} time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of <b>these</b> <b>variables</b> in a given region.|$|E
5|$|Four {{anatomic}} features must {{be present}} for orotracheal intubation to be straightforward: adequate mouth opening (full {{range of motion}} of the temporomandibular joint), sufficient pharyngeal space (determined by examining {{the back of the}} mouth), sufficient submandibular space (distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin, the space into which the tongue must be displaced in order for the larygoscopist to view the glottis), and adequate extension of the cervical spine at the atlanto-occipital joint. If any of <b>these</b> <b>variables</b> is in any way compromised, intubation should be expected to be difficult.|$|E
5|$|The 2-satisfiability {{problem is}} to find a truth {{assignment}} to <b>these</b> <b>variables</b> that makes the whole formula true. Such an assignment chooses whether to make each of the variables true or false, so that at least one literal to true in every clause becomes true. For the expression shown above, one possible satisfying assignment is the one that sets all seven of the variables to true. Every clause has at least one non-negated variable, so this assignment satisfies every clause. There are also 15 other ways of setting all the variables so that the formula becomes true. Therefore, the 2-satisfiability instance represented by this expression is satisfiable.|$|E

5|$|Before {{accretion}} {{of material}} pushes a white dwarf {{close to the}} Chandrasekhar limit, accreted hydrogen-rich material on the surface may ignite in a less destructive type of thermonuclear explosion powered by hydrogen fusion. These surface explosions can be repeated {{as long as the}} white dwarf's core remains intact. This weaker kind of repetitive cataclysmic phenomenon is called a (classical) nova. Astronomers have also observed dwarf novae, which have smaller, more frequent luminosity peaks than the classical novae. These are thought to be caused by the release of gravitational potential energy when part of the accretion disc collapses onto the star, rather than through a release of energy due to fusion. In general, binary systems with a white dwarf accreting matter from a stellar companion are called cataclysmic variables. As well as novae and dwarf novae, several other classes of <b>these</b> <b>variables</b> are known, including polars and intermediate polars, both of which feature highly magnetic white dwarfs. Both fusion- and accretion-powered cataclysmic variables have been observed to be X-ray sources.|$|E

40|$|Pathogenic {{species of}} Neisseria utilize {{variable}} outer membrane proteins to facilitate infection and proliferation within the human host. However, the mechanisms behind {{the evolution of}} <b>these</b> <b>variable</b> alleles remain largely unknown due to analysis of previously limited datasets. In this study, we have expanded upon the previous analyses to substantially {{increase the number of}} analyzed sequences by including multiple diverse strains, from various geographic locations, to determine whether positive selective pressure is exerted on the evolution of <b>these</b> <b>variable</b> genes. Although Neisseria are naturally competent, this analysis indicates that only intrastrain horizontal gene transfer among the pathogenic Neisseria principally account for these genes exhibiting linkage equilibrium which drives the polymorphisms evidenced within these alleles. As the majority of polymorphisms occur across species, the divergence of <b>these</b> <b>variable</b> genes is dependent upon the species and is independent of geographical location, disease severity, or serogroup. Tests of neutrality were able to detect strong selection pressures acting upon both the opa and pil gene families, and were able to locate the majority of these sites within the exposed variable regions of the encoded proteins. Evidence of positive selection acting upon the hypervariable domains of Opa contradicts previous beliefs and provides evidence for selection of receptor binding. As the pathogenic Neisseria reside exclusively within the human host, the strong selection pressures acting upon both the opa and pil gene families provide support for host immune system pressure driving sequence polymorphisms within <b>these</b> <b>variable</b> genes...|$|R

25|$|The {{temporal}} {{behavior of}} Na+ channels can be modeled by a Markovian scheme {{or by the}} Hodgkin–Huxley-type formalism.

Each of <b>these</b> <b>variables</b> can attain a value between 1 (fully permeant to ions) and 0 (fully non-permeant), the product of <b>these</b> <b>variables</b> yielding the percentage of conducting channels.

We develop variable change methods for discrete symplectic (i. e., J-orthogonal) systems.

We generalize results of Bohner and Došlý on transformations of formally self-adjoint scalar difference operators.
