40|$|Risk {{and nuclear}} waste - {{a study of}} <b>the</b> <b>experts</b> in modern society Modem {{societies}} are characterized by their extensive <b>expert</b> <b>systems,</b> which penetrate all aspects of social life. The point of departure {{in this article is}} Anthony Giddens’ theory of <b>expert</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>The</b> theory is criticized and said to be both wide and vague, and depend too much on the notion of trust. It is in the article argued that there are life worlds outside <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems,</b> with their own rationalities, which possibly can work as counter forces and sometimes also are able to change <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems.</b> Giddens’ theory, based on the notions of trust and weak inductive knowledge, ignores the independent cognitive capacities among the laymen. Supplementing Giddens’ theory with some results from the sociology of science it is argued that both the experts’ and the laymen’s relations to <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> should be understood as alternating between trust and a cognitive attitude. <b>The</b> theory of <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> is illustrated by the history of nuclear waste management in Sweden, which is an activity highly dependent on trust and legitimacy among the general public.

40|$|AbstractWe {{compared}} {{the performance of}} expert-crafted rules, a Bayesian network, and a decision tree at automatically identifying chest X-ray reports that support acute bacterial pneumonia. We randomly selected 292 chest X-ray reports, 75 (25 %) of which were from patients with a hospital discharge diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia. The reports were encoded by our natural language processor and then manually corrected for mistakes. The encoded observations were analyzed by three <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> {{to determine whether the}} reports supported pneumonia. The reference standard for radiologic support of pneumonia was the majority vote of three physicians. We compared (a) the performance of <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> against each other and (b) the performance of <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> against that of four physicians who were not part of the gold standard. Output from <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> and <b>the</b> physicians was transformed so that comparisons could be made with both binary and probabilistic output. Metrics of comparison for binary output were sensitivity (sens), precision (prec), and specificity (spec). The metric of comparison for probabilistic output was the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. We used McNemar's test to determine statistical significance for binary output and univariate z-tests for probabilistic output. Measures of performance of <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> for binary (probabilistic) output were as follows: Rules—sens, 0. 92; prec, 0. 80; spec, 0. 86 (Az, 0. 960); Bayesian network—sens, 0. 90; prec, 0. 72; spec, 0. 78 (Az, 0. 945); decision tree—sens, 0. 86; prec, 0. 85; spec, 0. 91 (Az, 0. 940). Comparisons of <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> against each other using binary output showed {{a significant difference between the}} rules and the Bayesian network and between the decision tree and the Bayesian network. Comparisons of <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> using probabilistic output showed no significant differences. Comparisons of binary output against physicians showed differences between the Bayesian network and two physicians. Comparisons of probabilistic output against physicians showed a difference between the decision tree and one physician. <b>The</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> performed similarly for the probabilistic output but differed in measures of sensitivity, precision, and specificity produced by the binary output.
