5|$|Teller {{later learned}} of Oppenheimer's {{solicitation}} {{and his role}} in the Interim Committee's decision to drop the bombs, having secretly endorsed an immediate military use of the new weapons. This was contrary to the impression that Teller had received when he had personally asked Oppenheimer about the Szilard petition: that the nation's fate should be left to <b>the</b> <b>sensible</b> politicians in Washington. Following Teller's discovery of this, his relationship with his advisor began to deteriorate.|$|E
5|$|The {{trade off}} is between {{capacity}} and price. I've had some conversations with people saying 'it's {{getting a bit}} expensive Alan' and I know it is. I think the obvious route is the Geoffrey Watling stand, whether you put another layer on it or take it down and re-build, I don't know. Probably <b>the</b> <b>sensible</b> {{thing to do is}} bite the bullet, take it down and build a new stand, but it means 18 to 24 months without revenue and the people in that stand tend to be {{the people who have been}} the supporters for many generations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{before and after the}} first {{demonstration}} of a nuclear weapon, the Trinity test in July 1945, his fellow Hungarian Leo Szilard circulated the Szilard petition, which argued that a demonstration to the Japanese of the new weapon should occur prior to actual use on Japan, and with that hopefully the weapons would never be used on people. In response to Szilard's petition, Teller consulted his friend Robert Oppenheimer. Teller believed that Oppenheimer was a natural leader and could help him with such a formidable political problem. Oppenheimer reassured Teller that the nation's fate should be left to <b>the</b> <b>sensible</b> politicians in Washington. Bolstered by Oppenheimer's influence, he decided to not sign the petition.|$|E

This lets us make judgments such as “you ought to have done that thing that you did not do.” Kant argues that this notion of freedom cannot be derived from our experience.

25|$|On the air side of HVAC coils a {{significant}} difference exists between those used for heating, and those for cooling. Due to psychrometrics, air that is cooled often has moisture condensing out of it, except with extremely dry air flows. Heating some air increases that airflow's capacity to hold water. So heating coils need not consider moisture condensation on their air-side, but cooling coils must be adequately designed and selected to handle their particular latent (moisture) as well as <b>the</b> <b>sensible</b> (cooling) loads. The water that is removed is called condensate.|$|E
25|$|In an 1847 lecture {{entitled}} On Matter, Living Force, and Heat, James Prescott Joule {{characterized the}} terms latent heat and sensible heat as components of heat each affecting distinct physical phenomena, namely the potential and kinetic energy of particles, respectively. He described latent energy as the energy possessed via a distancing of particles where attraction was over a greater distance, i.e. {{a form of}} potential energy, and <b>the</b> <b>sensible</b> heat as an energy involving the motion of particles or what {{was known as a}} living force. At the time of Joule kinetic energy either held 'invisibly' internally or held 'visibly' externally was known as a living force.|$|E
25|$|Compared to Aristotle and his strictest medieval followers, these Roman {{authors were}} not so strict about the {{boundary}} between animal-like common sense and specially human reasoning. As discussed above, Aristotle had attempted to make a clear distinction between, on the one hand, imagination and the sense perception which both use <b>the</b> <b>sensible</b> koina, and which animals also have; and, on the other hand, nous (intellect) and reason, which perceives another type of koina, the intelligible forms, which (according to Aristotle) only humans have. In other words, these Romans allowed that people could have animal-like shared understandings of reality, not {{just in terms of}} memories of sense perceptions, {{but in terms of the}} way they would tend to explain things, and in the language they use.|$|E

40|$|Sensible lambda {{theories}} are equational {{extensions of the}} untyped lambda-calculus that equate all the unsolvable lambda-terms and are closed under derivation. <b>The</b> least <b>sensible</b> lambda theory is the lambda theory (generated by equating all the unsolvable terms), while <b>the</b> greatest <b>sensible</b> lambda theory is the lambda theory ^* (generated by equating terms with the same Böhm tree up to possibly infinite η-equivalence). A longstanding open problem in lambda calculus is whether there exists a non-syntactic model of lambda calculus whose equational theory is <b>the</b> least <b>sensible</b> -theory. A related question is whether, given a class of models, there exist a minimal and maximal sensible lambda-theory represented by it. In this paper we give a positive {{answer to this question}} for the semantics of lambda calculus given in terms of graph models (graph semantics, for short). We conjecture that <b>the</b> minimal <b>sensible</b> graph theory (where "graph theory" means "lambda-theory of a graph model") is equal to, while in the main result of the paper we characterize <b>the</b> maximal <b>sensible</b> graph theory as the lambda-theory (generated by equating -terms with the same Böhm tree). In fact, we prove that all the equation M = N between solvable lambda-terms M and N, which have different Böhm trees, fail in every graph model. In a further result of the paper we prove the existence of a continuum of different graph models whose equational {{theories are}} sensible and strictly included in...|$|R

However, Kiwi Party President Larry Baldock failed to submit enough signatures for a petition that might have led to a non-binding referendum on whether or not binding citizens referenda should be introduced after being granted permission to circulate a petition calling for that innovation, so the status quo remains. Although the Kiwi Party applied for deregistration, the cause has been taken up by the Conservative Party of New Zealand and its leader, Colin Craig.|$|E

25|$|While {{the image}} of a ninja clad in black garb (shinobi shōzoku) is {{prevalent}} in popular media, there is no written evidence for such a costume. Instead, it was much more common for the ninja to be disguised as civilians. The popular notion of black clothing is likely rooted in artistic convention; early drawings of ninja showed them dressed in black in order to portray a sense of invisibility. This convention was an idea borrowed from the puppet handlers of bunraku theater, who dressed in total black in an effort to simulate props moving independently of their controls. Despite the lack of hard evidence, it has been put forward by some authorities that black robes, perhaps slightly tainted with red to hide bloodstains, was indeed <b>the</b> <b>sensible</b> garment of choice for infiltration.|$|E
