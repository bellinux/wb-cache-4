500|$|Eminem {{responded to}} Cannon's {{comments}} sarcastically, clarifying that {{the song was}} really [...] "wishing the couple the best", {{and that it was}} a misunderstanding. In an interview with BBC Radio, Eminem clarified that although contained a [...] "harsh" [...] line, he meant well: [...] "There's a line on there that was a little harsh. It's a harsh line. But it's like this, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, I had no idea he was gonna take it like he took it. I had no idea Nick Cannon was gonna start wildin' out on me. No pun intended." [...] He later commented that he respected Cannon for his comment, and that he expected him to stand up for his wife: [...] "I didn't read his blog or anything. But it is what it is. He's supposed to defend his wife, and I expected him to do that. But {{at the end of the}} day, it's a line I said – it's a song. What I actually meant to say is, I wish them the best. That's what I meant to say. That's the whole message of the record." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Nobody's Business" [...] mixes Chicago {{stepping}} {{and house}} styles, featuring strings, piano, and a four-on-the-floor kick drum. Rihanna {{said that the}} song's lyrics show [...] "basically <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> everything regarding my personal life." [...] Lyrically, the couple proclaims their eternal fealty, make out in a Lexus and acknowledge {{the world that the}} romantic relationship between them is only their business.|$|E

6000|$|Oh, {{blow the}} Mister and blow the Bush. Call me Jimmie. I can't stand ceremony. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> {{on it is}} this. We're both of us gentlemen. Now, mind you, I'm not a fellow to praise myself. But I will say this: I am a gentleman. That's not self-praise, is it? ...|$|R
2500|$|In August 2013, New York Post sports {{reporter}} Justin Terranova {{wrote that}} the butt fumble [...] "has come to define Sanchez’s downfall with the Jets." [...] Terranova {{wrote that the}} play had unfairly overshadowed Sanchez's AFC Championship campaigns in the previous two seasons, as well as Moore's [...] "ten years manning a generally-solid Jets offensive line." [...] When Moore retired in 2013, he reflected on the play, [...] "It's amusing to me that people think it's so amusing. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, I don't think it should have any link to my career. I don't think it stands for what I was as a player for 10 years. I really don't give it much thought." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before the 2008 presidential {{election}}, Trudeau {{sent out}} strips {{to run in}} the days after the election in which Barack Obama was portrayed as the winner. Newspapers were also provided with old strips as an alternative. When asked whether he created the original strip with complete confidence in an Obama victory, Trudeau replied: [...] "'Nope, more like rational risk assessment. Nate Silver at Fivethirtyeight.com is now giving McCain a 3.7% chance of winning – pretty comfortable odds. Here's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it: If Obama wins, I'm in the flow and commenting on a phenomenon. If he loses, it'll be a massive upset, and the goofy misprediction of a comic strip will be pretty much lost in the uproar. I figure I can survive a little egg on my face'." [...] In response, McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said, [...] "We hope the strip proves to be as predictive as it is consistently lame." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, she {{released}} her second album, Now Is the Time, a ballad-driven record that featured less glitzy production than Alanis and contained more thoughtful lyrics. Morissette wrote the songs with the album's producer, Leslie Howe, and Serge Côté. She {{said of the}} album, [...] "people could go, 'Boo, hiss, hiss, this girl's like another Tiffany or whatever.' But <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it ... people will like your next album if it's a suck-ass one." [...] As with Alanis (1991), Now Is the Time (1992) was released only in Canada and produced three top 40 singles—"An Emotion Away", the minor adult contemporary hit [...] "No Apologies" [...] and [...] "(Change Is) Never a Waste of Time". It was a commercial failure, however, selling {{only a little more}} than half the copies of her first album. With her two-album deal with MCA Records Canada complete, Morissette was left without a major label contract.|$|E
50|$|I think it's fair to {{say that}} that long period allowed me to change <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at life. Until then, for me, the {{professionals}} were gods. Now, when I see a sportsman, I see the man. The status of champion isn't enough. A champion can be a good guy as much as a bad one.|$|R
5000|$|Bajo said Ask Good Game is [...] "my {{favourite}} {{part of the}} show, reading {{those letters}} and making the noises". He added [...] "It's my dream that one day kids might look back on GGSP in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> back on shows from my youth, I hope we do it well enough that this might happen." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kurt Cobain listed {{it in his}} top fifty albums of all time. The album has {{attracted}} praise from rock musicians.

2500|$|Hathcock {{once said}} that he survived in his work because of an ability to [...] "get in the bubble", to put himself {{into a state of}} [...] "utter, complete, {{absolute}} concentration", first with his equipment, then his environment, in which every breeze and every leaf meant something, and finally on his quarry. After the war, a friend showed Hathcock a passage written by Ernest Hemingway: [...] "Certainly there is no hunting like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and like it, never really care for anything else thereafter." [...] He copied Hemingway's words on a piece of paper. [...] "He got that right," [...] Hathcock said. [...] "It was the hunt, not the killing." [...] Hathcock said in a book written about his career as a sniper: [...] "I like shooting, and I love hunting. But I never did enjoy killing anybody. It's my job. If I don't get those bastards, then they're gonna kill a lot of these kids dressed up like Marines. That's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1996, {{the long-running}} Somalia inquiry claimed a {{prominent}} victim when General Jean Boyle {{was forced to}} resign as Chief of the Defence Staff allowing allegations that he attempted to stymie the work of the inquiry and he had committed perjury when he testified before the inquiry about his role in the alleged Somalia cover-up of 1993. That same month, David Collenette, whose position was widely seen as untenable after Boyle's resignation given that he had personally selected Boyle, resigned as Defence Minister, ostensibly because of a minor violation of the ethics rules, to be replaced with Doug Young. Young frankly admitted in an interview in late 1996 he [...] "certainly wouldn't want to be in an election campaign with the inquiry still going on". In early 1997, Young ordered the inquiry to be shut down despite the complaints from the commissioners that their work was far from done. This marked the effective end of the Somalia Affair. Speaking about the shut-down of the inquiry, one of the commissioner Peter Desbarats said: [...] "The fact that Chrétien was willing to tamper with something like an independent inquiry for the sake of what appeared to be minuscule political advantage, I just thought, Wow, if he'll do that, he'll do anything." [...] Desbarats stated that he once been a fan of Chrétien, but the shut-down of the Somalia inquiry [...] "changed <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him totally".|$|E

6000|$|... "I am {{delighted to}} find that we agree on one point," [...] he rejoined, dryly. [...] "I don't despair yet of convincing you in that far more serious matter which is still in dispute between us. And, what is more, if you will throw no {{obstacles}} in <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> to Dexter himself to help me." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I sing low now, but {{my voice}} {{used to be}} a lot higher. Because of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look,</b> <b>I</b> needed {{something}} to ground the entire project. Otherwise I think people would assume I was some airhead singer. Well, I don't think... I know. I've sung one way, and sung another, and I've seen what people are drawn to", she said on the topic.|$|R

6000|$|... "That's just it. It was tit for tat, I think. That's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it. At {{any rate}} {{we are living}} {{together}} now, {{and no one can}} say we're not man and wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't the {{commodore}} {{allow that}} we should keep right on bein' oystermen?" [...] Darius asked with just a shade of impatience. [...] "How do you expect we can sneak around the British fleet unless we've got some excuse for goin' there? It was in Joshua Barney's mind, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at it, that we might sell oysters to the fleet, which would account for our bein' among the vessels, an' to do that we've got {{to put in a}} cargo." ...|$|R
5000|$|In May 1949, Davis {{performed}} with the Tadd Dameron Quintet with Kenny Clarke and James Moody at the Paris International Jazz Festival, his first trip abroad. Davis took a strong liking for Paris and its cultural environment, where black jazz musicians, and African Americans in general, were better respected than in America. The trip, he described, [...] "changed <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at things forever". During his time there Davis began {{a love affair with}} singer and actress Juliette Gréco which lasted for several years.|$|R
5000|$|... "There’s {{something}} about {{the simplicity of the}} lyrics, with the openness of my heart, I just didn’t want anything dramatic," [...] she told InStyle of her look, a relaxed little white dress and bare feet. [...] "I wanted classy and simple." [...] "I wanted to <b>look</b> exactly <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> right now in this video, in a dress I would wear at home or on stage, in my jewelry, with the minimal makeup I actually wear, and just being me", she said.

6000|$|... "Well, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it is this. It's no use grumbling. One has got {{to realise}} that in England one is in a savage country, and one should simply be thankful one isn't eaten by the natives." ...|$|E

5000|$|Later, in an {{interview}} to the media, Sivaji spoke about his character in the film. He spoke [...] "I change <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> — from <b>the</b> clothes I wear to my dressing to my moustache, hair styling. A military man {{who works in the}} Burmese Army, comes hunting for a friend and meets a girl called Kamala and falls for her." [...] He also added [...] "The entire film was shot in rain from the first frame to the last frame. Wherever there was water we would stop and shoot there.

5000|$|... "I {{was kind}} of at a dead end in what I was {{listening}} to, and it just {{opened up a whole}} new world for me," [...] he said in a 2011 interview with Noise Narcs. [...] "That was in 1999. For a while it affected <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at my music, but I was still playing drums in bands, and it didn’t seem like something I should pursue. You go through these fads or trends as a listener, where you’re really into something for a month and then it changes.

60|$|It {{was no time}} {{to think}} about not waking Peter. This was {{something}} definite, something that had to be attended to quick. I was up with a jump, yelling.

So even though I'll do a 'Hotline Bling' cover, the fact that there's aspects of the music that are foreign and even the aspects of me — <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> — <b>I</b> think that makes a difference because it's something people haven't seen, and it's something people need to see." ...|$|R
