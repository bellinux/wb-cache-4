5|$|Belldandy is {{regarded}} by commentators {{as an example}} of the magical girlfriend character, and comparisons have been drawn with <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> Samantha from Bewitched and Jeannie from I Dream of Jeannie. The character's very conservative nature, however, which almost completely subordinates her to her fictional boyfriend, Keiichi, has led to some concerns from critics and has polarized the audience.|$|E

5|$|Kanhopatra's {{history is}} known through stories passed down over centuries, {{making it hard}} to {{separate}} fact and fiction.

40|$|This article {{begins with}} a {{theological}} argument, then proceeds to practical application. Its thesis {{is that there is}} an inherent link between <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preacher, <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> congregation, and <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gospel proclaimed. They mirror one another. Many congregations are not equipped to deal with change, growth, or evangelism because they have become entrenched in one style of leadership or structured life; thus, before congregations can change, before a congregation can take a new direction in gospel living, <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preacher must be converted. This contribution to the topic proposes that <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preacher and the preacher’s congregation can draw closer to <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gospel through the practice and teaching of homiletics...|$|R

5|$|Several P.G. Wodehouse novels use {{the setting}} of Piccadilly as the {{playground}} of the rich, idle bachelor in the inter-war period of the 20th century.

5|$|Some critics {{believed}} that {{the name of the}} apartment building, as well as Walter's coin tosses coming up heads, are references to the 1966 tragicomedy Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, which in turn derives from <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two minor characters in Shakespeare's Hamlet.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> the God of War {{video game}} {{franchise}} {{belong to a}} fictional universe that was, originally, loosely based on Greek mythology—an eighth installment is in development and will be loosely based on Norse mythology.

5|$|The {{critical}} {{reception for}} the episode was mostly positive.

5|$|The {{episode was}} written {{as a way}} to signal Mulder's exit from the FBI.
