40|$|A new anaerobic, mesophilic, spore-forming {{cellulolytic}} bacterium is described. Cellulose is cleared within 24 <b>to</b> 48 <b>h</b> <b>around</b> colonies {{formed in}} cellulose agar roll tubes. Cells stain gram negative and are nonmotile rods which form oblong spores either centrally or subterminally in a clostridial swelling. Colonies are irregular with an opaque edge and a center devoid of both vegetative cells and spores. Cellulose, xylan, pectin, cellobiose, glucose, maltose, galactose, sucrose, lactose, and mannose serve as substrates for growth. H 2, CO 2, acetate, butyrate, formate, and lactate are produced during fermentation of cellulose or cellobiose. The temperature and pH for optimum growth are 37 °C and 7. 0, respectively. The DNA composition is 26 to 27 mol% guanine plus cytosine. This bacterium resembles “Clostridium lochheadii” in morphological and some biochemical characteristics {{but is not}} identical to it. The name Clostridium cellulovorans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 743 B (ATCC 35296) ...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} whether a single episode of physical activity is capable of inducing rapid phase shifts in human circadian rhythms, 17 subjects were studied two times under constant routine conditions, once {{in the absence of}} stimulus and once with a 3 -h nighttime pulse of exercise interrupting the constant routine conditions. The profiles of plasma cortisol, thyrotropin (TSH), and melatonin and of body temperature were monitored continuously to derive estimations of circadian phase position. The phase shifts were measured on the 1 st day after exercise exposure. The timing of the exercise period ranged from - 5 <b>h</b> <b>to</b> + 4 <b>h</b> <b>around</b> the time of the minimum body temperature rhythm. Nighttime exercise was associated with 1 - to 2 -h phase delays of both the melatonin and TSH rhythms, with the size of the delays tending to be smaller when the exercise was presented {{in the latter part of}} the nighttime period and in the early morning. These data demonstrate that nonphotic stimuli may exert phase-shifting effects on the human circadian pacemaker. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tResearch Support, U. S. Gov't, Non-P.

The searches cover both the prompt and a possible precursor emission {{as well as a}} model-independent, wide time window of - 1 <b>h</b> <b>to</b> + 3 <b>h</b> <b>around</b> each GRB. In contrast to previous searches with a large GRB population, we do not utilize a standard Waxman?Bahcall GRB flux for the prompt emission but calcu- late individual neutrino spectra for all 41 GRBs from the burst parameters measured by satellites. For all three time windows the best estimate for the number of signal events is zero. Therefore, we place 90 percent CL upper limits on the fluence from the prompt phase of 3. 7 x 10 - 3 erg cm- 2 (72 TeV - 6. 5 PeV) and on the fluence from the precursor phase of 2. 3 x 10 - 3 erg cm- 2 (2. 2 TeV - 55 TeV), where the quoted energy ranges contain 90 percent of the expected signal events in the detector.

40|$|THP- 1 {{cells are}} human {{monocyte}} like cell line that is blocked at certain {{steps of the}} differentiation process and its differentiation into macrophages can be induced by addition of PMA. PMA activates Protein Kinase C (PKC) that mimics the physiological activator diacylglycerol (DAG) thus differentiation into macrophage occurs. These cells mimic the alveolar macrophages. So, is a good model to study tuberculosis. According <b>to</b> W. <b>H.</b> O. <b>around</b> 1. 3 million people die of this disease every year. Mycobacterium tuberculosis the causative organism of this disease enters into the body through the airway passages. The alveolar macrophages phagocyte the bacteria. Once inside they escape degradation by preventing the phagosomes-lysosome fusion. Thus, they survive inside the phagosomes by inhibiting autophagy. To curtail this bacterial load, various host defence mechanisms like apoptosis, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, phagosome-lysosome fusion and autophagy play a very important role. Autophagy in the cells is induced by ATP, vitamin D, cytokines. ATP is known to increase the intracellular calcium level that facilitates autophagy. Calcimining, an important calcium ionosphere increases the intracellular calcium level thus facilitates autophagy. Since autophagy {{plays an important role}} in curtailing bacterial load so we attempted to study the role of PMA in inducing autophagy in THP- 1 cells...|$|R

The overall averaged transmission coefficients, (T(N)) (av), calculated from sixteen chromosomes are shown to be significantly different from values calculated from random as well as periodic sequences. Sequences from the S. cerevisiae genome promise better charge conduction ability than random sequences. Finally, delocalized electronic wave function patterns are also shown through calculations using the tight binging model. Slightly delocalized electronic wavefunctions are seen on sequences in sixteen chromosomes, as compared with those obtained from random sequences on the same eigenenergies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

Immunolocalization of PHase was studied using an anti-rat PHase subunit monoclonal antibody, and the amount of immunoreactive PHase was measured by enzymeimmunoassay. No obvious immuno-localization of PHase was observed in theca cells throughout the ovulatory process exceptjust after follicular rupture. In contrast, in granulosa cells, PHase was first observed at 9 h after the hCG injection, and the staining intensity apparently increased from 9 <b>to</b> 15 <b>h,</b> especially <b>around</b> the apex of preovulatory follicles and the orifice of ruptured follicles. Consistent with these observations, PHase concentration in granulosa cells isolated from the ovaries significantly increased by 9 h (0. 45 =+-. 03 pg per cell), and reached a peak at 15 h(0. 66 =+-. 06 pg per cell) after the hCG injection. This peak was inhibited when 20 mg RU 486 kg =- was administered at 8 h (0. 46 =+-. 05 pg per cell), and the RU 486 -inhibited PHase concentration was recovered by the concomitant administration of 10 mg progesterone kg =- (0. 65 =+-. 02 pg per cell).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sodium aurothiomalate {{has been}} {{reported}} to have in vitro activity against Helicobacter pylori. Intramuscular gold, as given to patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), may therefore influence the colonisation of the gastric mucosa with H pylori. METHODS: Two groups were compared. One group of 42 patients was treated with intramuscular gold; the other group of 58 patients was treated with antimalarial drugs. Antibodies <b>to</b> <b>H</b> pylori (IgA and IgG) were assessed by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and total IgA and IgG were measured by nephelometry. RESULTS: IgA and IgG antibody titres against H pylori and total IgA and IgG levels were lower in the patients treated with gold than in the group treated with antimalarial drugs. The ratio of IgA antibodies <b>to</b> <b>H</b> pylori <b>to</b> total IgA antibodies and the ratio of IgG antibodies <b>to</b> <b>H</b> pylori <b>to</b> total IgG antibodies were lower in the group treated with gold. The percentage of seropositivity <b>to</b> <b>H</b> pylori was significantly lower in the group treated with gold than in the group treated with antimalarial drugs for the two IgA antibodies (35 and 55 % respectively) and IgG antibodies <b>to</b> <b>H</b> pylori (40 and 65 % respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although this study cannot completely exclude the possibility that a suppressive effect of intramuscular gold on total immunoglobulin production plays a part in the decrease in the titres of IgA antibodies <b>to</b> <b>H</b> pylori and IgG antibodies <b>to</b> <b>H</b> pylori, the lower ratios of antibodies <b>to</b> <b>H</b> pylori <b>to</b> total immunoglobulin antibodies and the lower percentages of seropositivity <b>to</b> <b>H</b> pylori in the group treated with gold suggests that treatment with intramuscular gold decreases H pylori colonisation...|$|R
