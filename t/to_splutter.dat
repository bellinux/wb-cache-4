2500|$|Owain {{remained}} free {{but now he}} was a hunted guerilla leader. The revolt continued <b>to</b> <b>splutter</b> on. In 1410, Owain readied {{his supporters}} for a last raid deep into Shropshire. Many of his most loyal commanders were present. It may have been a last desperate suicide raid. Whatever was intended, the raid went terribly wrong and many of the leading figures still at large were captured. Rhys Ddu ("Black Rhys") of Cardigan, one of Owain’s most faithful commanders, was captured and taken to London for execution. A chronicle of the time states that Rhys Ddu was: [...] "…laid on a hurdle and so drawn forth to Tyburn through the City and was there hanged and let down again. His head was smitten off and his body quartered and sent to four towns and his head set on London Bridge." [...] Philip Scudamore and Rhys ap Tudur were also beheaded and their heads displayed at Shrewsbury and Chester (no doubt to discourage any further thoughts of rebellion).|$|E

60|$|I had but {{an instant}} <b>to</b> think. <b>Spluttering</b> <b>to</b> himself, my assailant was endeavoring {{to rise to}} his feet.|$|R
60|$|Had he {{not every}} excuse? He was {{dripping}} from head <b>to</b> foot, <b>spluttering,</b> blinded, choked and bruised.|$|R
6000|$|... "And another pond for {{the healthy}} folk," [...] {{suggested}} Captain Arkal; [...] "we {{like to give}} ourselves a wash now and then, and it would never do for the healthy <b>to</b> go <b>spluttering</b> about with the sick--would it?" ...|$|R
60|$|A large drop of water, {{splashing}} {{down from}} the roof of the cavern, caused the light <b>to</b> <b>splutter</b> and go out.|$|E
60|$|The {{light of}} the lantern began <b>to</b> <b>splutter</b> and flare up, showing that the oil in the cup was running low.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Brewster, {{who was not}} deeply {{interested}} in Mr. Connolly's old mother, continued <b>to</b> <b>splutter</b> inarticulately, like a firework trying to go off.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop! Stop! What are {{you trying}} <b>to</b> do?" [...] <b>spluttered</b> Spouter. [...] "Trying to drown me in a flood of questions? Why don't you ask {{one thing at a}} time?" ...|$|R
50|$|In pre-qualifying, the Life Racing Engines team {{saw their}} car <b>splutter</b> <b>to</b> a halt 400 metres after exiting the pits, Gary Brabham claimed the {{mechanics}} were on strike {{and refused to}} put oil in the car.|$|R
40|$|How can {{quality of}} product sounds be measured? This {{question}} was investigated on basis of shaver, vacuum cleaner and spray sounds, which were matched in loudness according to DIN 45631 and were separately presented to subjects. Using open questions, {{the perception of}} the sounds was determined and a list with word pairs was created as a basis for a semantic differential. The sounds were presented to subjects in a listening booth and were rated separately for each product group. The data were analysed by means of polarity profiles and factor analyses. Groupings could be found for sounds and word pairs. For the word pairs, one factor representing quality could be found for each product group. This factor, the factor loadings and the answers of the subjects were used as basis for a linear model. The results indicate that spectral and temporal properties of spray sounds correlate with perception of quality. Stationary spray sounds were rated with a high quality in contrast <b>to</b> <b>spluttering</b> sounds. Vacuum cleaners need to sound powerful and functional to be perceived as top quality. Precise, cutting and fast sounds were perceived as top quality for shavers. The results are discussed on basis of auditory models...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hi! Hi! What's this? You let me go!" [...] cried Codfish, {{and then}} began <b>to</b> <b>splutter</b> as the dry cornmeal got {{into his mouth and}} nose.|$|E
6000|$|Erling made no reply, but Glumm {{started up}} and was in so great a passion that he could hardly speak; {{nevertheless}} he made shift <b>to</b> <b>splutter</b> out-- ...|$|E
60|$|They {{had just}} started to loosen a second stone, when the candle began <b>to</b> <b>splutter.</b> They saved {{it as much as}} they could, but in five minutes it flickered for the last time and went out, leaving them in a {{darkness}} that seemed more intense than ever.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good gracious, what’s {{the matter}} with the man?" [...] said Mrs. Bradd, with a scream. She {{snatched}} up a bowl of flowers and flung the contents in his face as her husband burst into the room. The mate sprang <b>to</b> his feet, <b>spluttering.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Oh, Mr. Froude, how {{wise and}} good, [...] To point us {{out this way}} to glory-- [...] They're no great shakes, those Snowdon Lakes, [...] And all their pounders myth and story.

60|$|The {{man with}} the shade became aware of my {{presence}} for the first time, and threw his head {{back for a moment}} and sideways, to see me. I caught a momentary glimpse of his eyes, small and bright and inflamed. Then he began <b>to</b> cough and <b>splutter</b> again.|$|R
60|$|While he {{was thus}} engaged, he chanced {{to raise his}} eyes towards the {{south-western}} horizon, and there saw something which caused him <b>to</b> <b>splutter,</b> for his mouth was too full to speak, but his speaking eyes and pointing finger caused his companions to turn their faces quickly to the quarter indicated.|$|E
60|$|Left {{again to}} himself, Tom lost {{no time in}} making way, {{not only with the}} {{sandwiches}} and cake, but also some of the bread and milk, for his day's traveling had left him tremendously hungry. The bit of candle was less than two inches long, and began <b>to</b> <b>splutter</b> just as the meal was finished.|$|E
60|$|The long fuse {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>splutter</b> and all {{watched it}} as if fascinated, and the girls put their hands to their ears {{in anticipation of a}} fearful explosion. Then came a tiny flash, a strange clicking, and off flew the top of the cannon cracker, sending a shower of confetti of various colors in all directions.|$|E
6000|$|Everything {{that met}} him in that breakfast-parlour was warm. The fire, of course, was warm, and it seemed <b>to</b> leap and <b>splutter</b> with a {{distinctly}} Christmas morning air; the curtains and carpets and arm-chairs were warm and cosy in aspect; the tea-urn was warm, indeed it was hot, and so were the muffins, while the atmosphere itself was unusually warm. The tiny thermometer on the chimney-piece told that it was 65 degrees of Fahrenheit. Outside, the self-registering thermometer indicated 5 degrees below zero! ...|$|R
60|$|They went on, and {{the memory}} of that {{afternoon}} long remained with them. They were grimed with black dust and ashes, and the ranks of charred trunks cast only thin strips of shade, while a scorching sun poured down an almost intolerable heat into the deep valley. The ground was ankle-deep in dust and charcoal, and, as they floundered through it, feathery ash rose in clouds. Their clothing grew crusted with it, and it worked through and irritated their heated skin; while every now and then one of them was compelled <b>to</b> stop and <b>splutter.</b> Their throats, as Grenfell remarked, certainly felt very much like ash-heaps. None of them had drunk anything since supper the night before, and then only a very little water that tasted alkaline.|$|R
5000|$|On 4 January 1847 he {{left the}} valley again, this {{time in order to}} enlist as a soldier for King Charles Albert. [...] He participated in the First Italian War of Independence, taking part in the Battles of Goito and Santa Lucia. He was {{captured}} by the Austrians and briefly held as a prisoner of war, before being released on 7 September 1948. In his autobiography he later took care to stress the humanity with which, as a prisoner, he was treated by the Austrian army. [...] After the Battle of Novara (23 March 1849) the war <b>spluttered</b> <b>to</b> an end, and he was sent on indefinite leave: he returned to Saint-Nicolas where, despite his age, he resumed his habit of attending the village school as a pupil, alongside the children.|$|R
60|$|This the northeast, was over-ready to do, and {{in answer}} to his whim a leaden, inky pall now lay over Thanet, whilst the gale {{continued}} its mighty, wanton frolic, lashing the sleet against the tiny window-panes of the cottage, or sending it down the chimneys, upon the burning logs below, causing them <b>to</b> <b>splutter</b> and to hiss ere they changed their glow to black and smoking embers.|$|E
60|$|The {{accident}} had sobered all the boys, {{consequently the}} lunch was not near so lively {{as it might}} otherwise have been. Still the irrepressible Randy could not hold back altogether, and he got what little sport he could out of it by putting some red pepper on Fatty's last mouthful of pie. He used a liberal dose, and the pie had scarcely disappeared within the stout youth's mouth when the boy began <b>to</b> <b>splutter.</b>|$|E
60|$|Jim Leonard {{thought the}} fellows had come along to pity him and help him; {{but when he}} heard Archy Hawkins say that, and Hen Billard began <b>to</b> <b>splutter</b> and choke with the laugh he was holding in, he flung them off and began to fight at them with his fists, and strike right and left blindly. He broke out crying, and then the fellows made a ring around him and danced and mocked him.|$|E
5000|$|In {{these stories}} {{we can see}} some of the {{elements}} that go into Heinlein's later works. There is a willingness to look at society, humanity in a slightly askance manner, for example, Delilah and the Space Rigger argues for more gender equality, before the argument had grown in Europe, before spreading outwards to Britain and the US. Similarly, while only a [...] "lowly secretary" [...] in [...] "We Also Walk Dogs", Grace Cormet, and scientist Mary Lou Martin in 'Let There Be Light', are very much role models for later, even more dynamic heroines like Helen Ripley. Heinlein's views on women taking a greater role in the workplace were expounded in [...] "Delilah and the Space Rigger', with G.B McNye and the attitude of her immediate boss. Given {{the role of women in}} the few SF films and books of the decade after these stories were written, which was to stand around and scream a lot or make up numbers, Heinlein was clearly displaying his radicalism and an amazing foresight that is unmatched by any other writer in the genre. Heinlein's feminist credentials were tarnished by revisionist reviews of his later female characters, but this was still the same man who, during an Apollo mission, reduced Walter Cronkite <b>to</b> a <b>spluttering</b> mess when he suggested women should be trained as astronauts.|$|R
60|$|As soon as I {{could do}} it I got myself free from the clothes-line and {{staggered}} out on the grass. I was trembling so much I could scarcely walk, but when I saw that young woman looking {{as if she was}} dead on the ground I felt I must do something, and seeing a pail of water standing near by, I held it over her face and poured it down on her a little at a time, and it wasn't long before she began to squirm, and then {{she opened her eyes and}} her mouth just at the same time, so that she must have swallowed about as much water as she would have taken at a meal. This brought her to, and she began <b>to</b> cough and <b>splutter</b> and look around wildly, and then I took her by the arm and helped her up on the bench.|$|R
5000|$|An early {{critical}} test of Kubrick's {{obsession with}} {{control on the}} set came during the making of Paths of Glory. As recalled by Kirk Douglas: He made the veteran actor Adolphe Menjou do the same scene 17 times. [...] "That was my best reading." [...] Menjou announced. [...] "I think we can break for lunch now." [...] It was well past the usual lunch time but Kubrick said he wanted another take. Menjou went into an absolute fury. In front of Douglas and the entire crew he blasted off on what he claimed was Kubrick's dubious parentage, and made several other unprintable references to Kubrick's relative greenness {{in the art of}} directing actors. Kubrick merely listened calmly, and, after Menjou had <b>spluttered</b> <b>to</b> an uncomplimentary conclusion, said quietly: [...] "All right, let's try the scene once more." [...] With utter docility, Menjou went back to work. [...] "Stanley instinctively knew what to do," [...] Douglas says.|$|R
60|$|Throughout the trip, he had {{manifested}} great curiosity {{concerning the}} kettle. He would {{sit and watch}} it, as it boiled, with a puzzled expression, and would try and rouse it {{every now and then}} by growling at it. When it began <b>to</b> <b>splutter</b> and steam, he regarded it as a challenge, and would want to fight it, only, at that precise moment, some one would always dash up and bear off his prey before he could get at it.|$|E
6000|$|A sea swept over. Jukes {{understood}} the boatswain <b>to</b> <b>splutter</b> that the bridge ladders were gone. [...] "I'll lower you down, sir, by your hands," [...] he screamed. He shouted also {{something about the}} smoke-stack being as likely to go overboard as not. Jukes thought it very possible, and imagined the fires out, the ship helpless. [...] . The boatswain by his side kept on yelling. [...] "What? What is it?" [...] Jukes cried distressfully; and the other repeated, [...] "What would my old woman say if she saw me now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'll {{tell him}} fast enough," [...] said Alderling, nursing his knee, and {{bringing}} it well up toward his chin, between his clasped hands. [...] "Marion {{has always had}} the notion that I should live again if I believed I should, and that as I don't believe I shall, I am not going to. The joke of it is," [...] and he began <b>to</b> <b>splutter</b> laughter round the stem of his pipe, [...] "she's {{as much of an}} agnostic as I am. She doesn't believe she is going to live again, either." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "At {{one point}} during the show, Glenn said to the audience, 'I'm sorry we're not playing very well, but we're very tired and jet-lagged.' And I {{remember}} <b>spluttering</b> <b>to</b> myself, 'Speak for yourself.' I was working like a Trojan {{to try and make}} this work...Paicey was playing like a madman just to keep it all together...Coverdale was singing his socks off. So to hear this guy who was extremely high on various substances telling the audience, 'I'm sorry, WE aren't playing well' kind of rankled me a bit. I came off stage and went straight to my dressing room, which I was sharing with Ian Paice, and I said, 'Ian...that's it, isn't it? That's absolutely the end of this band as far as I'm concerned. Why are we doing this to ourselves?' So he and I shook hands and said, 'It's over. Thank God.' About ten minutes later, Coverdale came in, big blustery guy that he is, and he said, 'I'm leaving the band!' And we said, 'David, there's no band to leave.'" ...|$|R
40|$|This year saw a {{consolidation}} {{of interest in}} the commercial aspects of Australian publication (labelled 2 ̆ 7 cultural materialism 2 ̆ 7) including enthusiastic calls for the application of statistical analysis to publishing history. The Mark Davis debate on the recent decline of Australian literary publishing <b>spluttered</b> <b>to</b> life again in articles that were mostly written in the final year of the Howard conservative government, although {{it is by no means}} clear that the advent of a Labor government will have much effect on those publishing conditions. Poetry again shows itself as a vital if uneconomic force, with many articles and three full-length books of criticism appearing, the best of which was Philip Mead 2 ̆ 7 s Networked Language: Culture and History in Australian Poetry. Eco-poetics continues to define itself, sometimes by claiming resonance with Aboriginal writing and sensibility. A useful article that attempts to lay out the field is that by Libby Robin discussed below. The year also saw Australian criticism looking outwards to other cultures and literature,with books and articles concerned with Australia 2 ̆ 7 s representation of and relationships with China, Japan, Italy, Britain and Russia...|$|R
40|$|Dear Scott— A playwright’s {{more or less}} unrequited {{correspondence}} with the Minister/s for Immigration & Border Protection I’d signed petitions and marched on demonstrations. With friends and colleagues {{there was a lot}} of talk—about mean spirits and narrow minds, about dirty political tricks to win votes. But it wasn’t enough. For all the anger I felt about Australia’s treatment of asylum-seekers, what had I, Noëlle Janaczewska, actually done? My outrage was aired in cafés and across dinner tables with people who shared it, and there it stayed. Because whenever I thought about the cruel and punitive way this country deals with refugees I felt hopeless—or helpless—or both. The issue seemed too big. The people who could change things had no heart to do so. But it wasn’t enough <b>to</b> sigh and <b>splutter</b> at each successive policy announcement. I needed to translate my anger into something tangible, challenge those responsible for sending asylum-seekers to offshore gulags. Words would be my weapon of choice. Christmas Day 2013. I wrote a letter to Scott Morrison, then Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. A paper, snail-mail missive, not an email likely to get ‘lost’ in his department’s spam filter. And every Wednesday for the next 6 months, I wrote to the Minister. This is our correspondence...|$|R
