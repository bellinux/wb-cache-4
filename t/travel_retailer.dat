40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the structure of}} the Korean package tour industry in Australia. Because of the demand by Korean consumers for cheap package tours, Korean tour wholesalers have lowered the wholesale package price to <b>travel</b> <b>retailers</b> to maintain market share. Rather than suffering a fall in profit from lower receipts, the Korean wholesale sector has forced the Inbound Tour Operator sector in Australia to absorb the cost of low retail prices. Unable to absorb lower revenue, the Inbound Tour Operators have been forced to recover losses through a range business practices that include the payment of commissions from tourist specialist shops, reduced tour quality and forced shopping. The operation of the Korean inbound market that facilitates the operation of such business practices is discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Tourists {{are one of}} {{the main}} market {{segments}} for service providers such as parks, museums, restaurants, and <b>retailers.</b> <b>Travel</b> agencies expose tourists in their package tours to service providers for a referral fee. This paper studies the competitive effects of travel agency referral in a setting where differentiated products are sold by two competing service providers. Using a simple spatial competition model, a non-cooperative game is analysed with informed tourists where duopolistic service providers compete on price, focusing on equilibrium prices and the profit of each service provider. This paper shows that referral is beneficial except where the cost of referral is too high. Service providers employ travel agency referral in order to mitigate the intensity of price competition by committing to higher prices. tourism; <b>travel</b> agency referrals; <b>retailer</b> referral strategies; retailer competition; consumer welfare; retail prices; pricing strategy; price competition; tour packages; non-cooperative games; travel agencies; retailing; package tours; equilibrium prices; profits; referral fees...|$|R
