5|$|Sponges with photosynthesizing endosymbionts produce up {{to three}} times more oxygen than <b>they</b> <b>consume,</b> {{as well as more}} organic matter than <b>they</b> <b>consume.</b> Such {{contributions}} to their habitats' resources are significant along Australia's Great Barrier Reef but relatively minor in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|Who pays: Where the {{purchaser}} {{does not}} directly pay for the good <b>they</b> <b>consume,</b> such as with corporate expense accounts, demand {{is likely to be}} more inelastic.|$|E

5000|$|The Neanderthal {{skeleton}} suggests <b>they</b> <b>consumed</b> [...] {{more per}} day than male modern humans of 68.5 kg and females of 59.2 kg.|$|R
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the diets of other species of porpoises. A {{dissection}} of three Burmeister's porpoises shows that <b>they</b> <b>consume</b> shrimp and euphausiids. A dissection of a beached Vaquita showed remains of squid and grunts. Nothing {{is known about}} the diet of the spectacled porpoise.|$|E
5|$|Scotch bonnets are predators; {{they search}} for their food on sandy {{stretches}} of the ocean floor, where <b>they</b> <b>consume</b> echinoderms such as sand dollars, sea biscuits, and other sea urchins (such as Echinocardium cordatum), drilling into their tests {{with the aid of}} sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|While the {{military}} is examining GORT, the robot transforms into a swarm of winged, insect-like, nano-machines that self-replicate as <b>they</b> <b>consume</b> everything in their path. The swarm soon devours the entire facility, emerging above ground to continue feeding.|$|E
50|$|Humans {{have also}} been shown to develop {{conditioned}} place preferences; for example, individuals taking therapeutic doses of amphetamine develop a CPP for where <b>they</b> <b>consumed</b> the drug.|$|R
50|$|The National Renewable Energy Laboratory {{believes}} that US counties {{have the potential}} to produce more renewable hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles than the gasoline <b>they</b> <b>consumed</b> in 2002.|$|R
50|$|In February 2009 a Malaysian {{fisherman}} {{died and}} four others were hospitalised after <b>they</b> <b>consumed</b> {{a meal of}} puffer fish when {{they ran out of}} food while at sea.|$|R
5|$|Slow lorises have {{an unusually}} low basal {{metabolic}} rate, about 40% {{of the typical}} value for placental mammals of their size, {{comparable to that of}} sloths. Since <b>they</b> <b>consume</b> a relatively high-calorie diet that is available year-round, it has been proposed that this slow metabolism is due primarily to the need to eliminate toxic compounds from their food. For example, slow lorises can feed on Gluta bark, which may be fatal to humans.|$|E
5|$|A decade-long {{study of}} urine and faecal samples at the Gunung Palung Orangutan Conservation Project in West Kalimantan {{has shown that}} orangutans give birth {{during and after the}} high fruit season (though not every year), during which <b>they</b> <b>consume</b> various {{abundant}} fruits, totalling up to 11,000 calories per day. In the low-fruit season, they eat whatever fruit is available in addition to tree bark and leaves, with daily intake at only 2,000 calories. Together with a long lactation period, orangutans also have a long birth interval.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, prokaryotes were {{regarded}} as a single group of organisms and classified based on their biochemistry, morphology and metabolism. For example, microbiologists tried to classify microorganisms based on the structures of their cell walls, their shapes, and the substances <b>they</b> <b>consume.</b> In 1965, Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling proposed instead using the sequences of the genes in different prokaryotes to work out how they are related to each other. This approach, known as phylogenetics, is the main method used today.|$|E
30|$|This {{frequency}} {{was chosen}} by asking a sample of 15 avocado fruit consumers how many times <b>they</b> <b>consumed</b> avocado during {{the period in which}} the fruit is on the market.|$|R

5|$|Laboratory {{studies have}} found that rice rats {{assimilate}} 88% to 95% of the energy in their food. They lose weight when fed on Spartina, fiddler crabs, or sunflower seeds alone, but a diet consisting of several of those items or of mealworms is adequate to maintain weight. In an experiment, marsh rice rats did not show hoarding behavior, but wild rice rats have been observed carrying food to a nest. Even when they live in uplands, they mostly eat water plants and animals, although <b>they</b> <b>consume</b> some upland plants.|$|E
5|$|Like {{almost any}} herbivore, <b>they</b> <b>consume</b> other plants if {{presented}} with them, but their diet in nature consists {{almost entirely of}} grass, with only minimal consumption of aquatic plants. Hippos are born with sterile intestines, and require bacteria obtained from their mothers' feces to digest vegetation. Hippos have (rarely) been filmed eating carrion, usually close to the water. There are other reports of meat-eating, and even cannibalism and predation. The stomach anatomy of a hippo is not suited to carnivory, and meat-eating is likely caused by aberrant behaviour or nutritional stress.|$|E
5|$|Shingouz {{have a high}} alcohol {{tolerance}} and preference for strong alcoholic beverages, which <b>they</b> <b>consume</b> in large quantities. The Shingouz society is capitalist to the extreme. Shingouz want a profit from everything they do. They are especially adept in trading important and sensitive information to interested parties. Valérian and Laureline have struck up {{a relationship with a}} group of three Shingouz who have a particularly useful network of contacts in all the major space communities. They are especially fond of Laureline, which she often uses to her advantage in striking favourable deals with them.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{observed}} that overall <b>they</b> <b>consumed</b> 27% of the dicotyledon leaf, 29% fungi, 17% invertebrate, and 14% of seeds. But {{there can be}} dietary differences depending on the local vegetation that the new holland mouse inhabits.|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} {{chemical}} process, PUREX (Plutonium–URanium EXtraction) reprocesses {{spent nuclear fuel}} to extract plutonium and uranium {{which can be used}} to form a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for reuse in nuclear reactors. Weapons-grade plutonium can be added to the fuel mix. MOX fuel is used in light water reactors and consists of 60kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel; after four years, three-quarters of the plutonium is burned (turned into other elements). Breeder reactors are specifically designed to create more fissionable material than <b>they</b> <b>consume.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} {{been implicated in}} the spread of weeds by {{consuming}} and dispersing fruit and seed. In {{the first half of}} the twentieth century, pied currawongs were shot as they were considered pests of corn and strawberry crops, as well as assisting in the spread of the prickly pear. They were also shot on Lord Howe Island for attacking chickens. However, they are seen as beneficial in forestry as <b>they</b> <b>consume</b> phasmids, and also in agriculture for eating cocoons of the codling moth.|$|E
5|$|Bullet souls {{are often}} projectiles, and consume a set amount of magic points upon use. Guardian souls provide {{continuous}} effects, including transforming into mythical creatures, defensive abilities, and the summoning of familiars. The movement and attacking of familiars {{can be directly}} controlled with the stylus. Guardian souls continually drain magic points {{so long as they}} are activated. Several Guardian souls can be used in conjunction with Bullet souls to execute special attacks called Tactical Soul combos. Enchant souls offer statistical bonuses and resistance against several forms of attack. They are passive, and require no magic points to remain active. Ability souls give the player new abilities and are required to move into certain areas of the castle. They are always active, and therefore not equipped, nor do <b>they</b> <b>consume</b> magic points. Some examples include the ability to break ice blocks with the stylus, and the ability to double-jump.|$|E
50|$|The fax {{machines}} {{of this period}} typically used expensive thermal paper and a common complaint about junk faxes was that <b>they</b> <b>consumed</b> that expensive paper without permission, thus shifting the cost of printing the advertisement to the recipient.|$|R
25|$|The Soviet Army {{provided}} five divisions, their supporting artillery formations, four tank battalions, 193 {{military aircraft}} and 45 captured German tanks {{to recreate the}} open field battles portrayed in The Fall of Berlin. <b>They</b> <b>consumed</b> 1.5 million liters of fuel during the filming.|$|R
50|$|Suppose that, in the {{caffeine}} study, the researcher {{was not able}} to assign 30 volunteers to each dose. Instead, 170 volunteers reported the estimated amount of caffeine <b>they</b> <b>consumed</b> in the previous 24 hours. The data are shown in the table below.|$|R
5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species <b>they</b> <b>consume.</b> This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill, Daniel, and Teal'c try {{to obtain}} {{intelligence}} {{on the little}} self-replicating robotic invaders in the submarine, but {{they are forced to}} fall back. With Daniel's new theory that the Replicators are made up of the same materials <b>they</b> <b>consume,</b> the Replicators may be eliminated through sinking the iron submarine as long as the surviving Replicator from Thor's advanced ship is destroyed beforehand. Meanwhile, Carter witnesses a short battle against the Replicators in the Asgard galaxy during which five Asgard ships are lost. Carter notices the Replicators' attraction to new technology and proposes to use the O'Neill, an incomplete Asgard ship originally designed to fight the Replicators, as a lure to draw the Replicators into hyperspace and destroy them in the O'Neills self-destruct. Thor eventually accepts the plan, the Replicators take the bait and are destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of deer to New Zealand {{began in the}} middle of the 19th century, and current populations are primarily European red deer, with only 15 percent being elk. There is significant hybridization of elk with the more numerous red deer to the extent that pure elk may no longer exist in the wild in New Zealand. These deer have had an adverse impact on forest regeneration of some plant species, as <b>they</b> <b>consume</b> more palatable species which are replaced with those that are less favored by the elk. The long-term impact will be an alteration of the types of plants and trees found, and in other animal and plant species dependent upon them. As in Chile and Argentina, the IUCN has declared that red deer and elk populations in New Zealand are an invasive species.|$|E

50|$|Their {{success on}} the Mendip hills {{prompted}} the Midland to try them on the East Midlands coal trains, {{but they were not}} so satisfactory. They were, after all, designed for climbing hills, but perhaps the reasons were fuel efficiency, for <b>they</b> <b>consumed</b> considerable amounts of high quality coal.|$|R
