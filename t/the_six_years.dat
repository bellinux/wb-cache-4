Interim President Abelardo L. Rodríguez did not get his cabinet's approval for the plan in 1933, so that Calles's next move was to present it in draft form to the party convention.

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>six</b> <b>years</b> {{of absolutism}} that {{followed}} Ferdinand's {{return to the}} throne on 1 January 1820, Rafael del Riego initiated an army revolt {{with the intent of}} restoring the 1812 Constitution. By March, the king was forced to agree, but by September 1823, after an unstable period, a French invasion supported by an alliance of the major powers had removed the constitutional government. The last prints were probably not completed until after the Constitution was restored, though certainly before Goya left Spain in May 1824. Their balance of optimism and cynicism makes it difficult to relate them directly to particular moments in these rapidly moving events.|$|E
