25|$|Most {{sources say}} that Democritus {{followed}} {{in the tradition of}} Leucippus and that they carried on the scientific rationalist philosophy associated with Miletus. Both were thoroughly materialist, believing everything {{to be the result of}} natural laws. Unlike Aristotle or Plato, the atomists attempted to explain the world without reasoning as <b>to</b> <b>purpose,</b> prime mover, or final cause. For the atomists questions of physics should be answered with a mechanistic explanation ("What earlier circumstances caused this event?"), while their opponents search for explanations which, in addition to the material and mechanistic, also included the formal and teleological ("What purpose did this event serve?").|$|E

However, due to the entrenchment of the ICCPR as applied in Hong Kong in Article 39 of the Basic Law, the significance of the Bill of Rights Ordinance, which was modelled after the ICCPR, has been reinstated.|$|E

Established by Royal Charter in 1583, the University of Edinburgh is one of Scotland's ancient universities and is the fourth oldest in the country after St Andrews, Glasgow and Aberdeen. Originally centred on Old College the university expanded to premises on The Mound, the Royal Mile and George Square.

[...] These European architects found the building's attention <b>to</b> <b>purpose</b> and functional expression inspiring. Bauhaus architect Ludwig Hilberseimer wrote that [...] "The false solution—unfortunately too common—of applying meaningless and misplaced adornment is here instinctively avoided. An innate feeling for proportion gives this great building inner consistency and logical purity." ...|$|E
500|$|When it was built, {{many critics}} called the {{building}} too extreme, {{and lacking in}} style.

Early 20th-century European architects found inspiration in its attention <b>to</b> <b>purpose</b> and functional expression. It {{was one of the}} first buildings named a Chicago Architectural Landmark in 1958. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, and named as part of the National Historic Landmark South Dearborn Street – Printing House Row North Historic District in 1976.

2500|$|Spinoza was {{considered}} to be an atheist because he used the word [...] "God" [...] (Deus) to signify a concept that was different from that of traditional Judeo–Christian monotheism. [...] "Spinoza expressly denies personality and consciousness to God; he has neither intelligence, feeling, nor will; he does not act according <b>to</b> <b>purpose,</b> but everything follows necessarily from his nature, according to law...." [...] Thus, Spinoza's cool, indifferent God is the antithesis to the concept of an anthropomorphic, fatherly God who cares about humanity.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{presence}} of the UNIPOM's 14 field stations, and over 90 observers, the Ceasefire was not always honoured. There were flagrant, breaches of the Cease fire agreement by both the sides. On 27 September 1965, the UN Security Council adopted resolution 214 which while expressing its 'grave concern' recorded that [...] " [...] the cease-fire agreed to unconditionally by the Governments of India and Pakistan is not holding". It demanded that [...] "the parties urgently honor their commitment to the Council to observe the cease-fire". This was followed on 5 November 1965, by resolution 215, which demanded [...] "that representatives of India and Pakistan meet with a representative of the Secretary-General <b>to</b> <b>purpose</b> schedules for the withdrawals." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{led to a}} {{distinction}} between proximate causes and explanations - [...] "how" [...] questions dealing with the phenotype; and ultimate causes - [...] "why" [...] questions, including evolutionary causes, focused on the genotype. This clarification {{was part of the}} great reconciliation, by Ernst Mayr, among others, in the 1940s, between Darwinian evolution by natural selection and the genetic model of inheritance. A commitment to conceptual clarification has characterised many of these philosophers since. Trivially, this has reminded us of the scientific basis of all biology, while noting its diversity - from microbiology to ecology. A complete philosophy of biology would need to accommodate all these activities. Less trivially, it has unpacked the notion of [...] "teleology". Since 1859, scientists have had no need for a notion of cosmic teleology - a programme or a law that can explain and predict evolution. Darwin provided that. But teleological explanations (relating <b>to</b> <b>purpose</b> or function) have remained stubbornly useful in biology - from the structural configuration of macromolecules to the study of co-operation in social systems. By clarifying and restricting {{the use of the term}} to describe and explain systems controlled strictly scientifically by genetic programmes, or other physical systems, teleological questions can be framed and investigated while remaining committed to the physical nature of all underlying organic processes.|$|E
