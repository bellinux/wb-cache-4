25|$|Having {{discovered}} his sexual inclination early in life, Negoiţescu {{claimed to have}} had his first sexual experiences while still a young boy. According to his own testimony, he made his coming out at around age sixteen, when he wrote about his homosexuality in a <b>test</b> <b>paper</b> which he then handed to his supervising teacher. Reportedly, the paper was graded a ten out of ten, without further commentary from its recipient. Negoiţescu later openly assumed his sexual identity and, in contrast to other gay men of 20th century Romania, did not deny {{it in front of}} the conservative cultural establishment (see LGBT rights in Romania). At the time however, the various ways in which the adolescent Negoiţescu disregarded social conventions caused a rift between him and his parents, resulting in the first of his several suicide attempts. Negoiţescu's subsequent life was marked by successive bouts of clinical depression and self-hatred.|$|E
40|$|With {{the rapidly}} {{increasing}} entrance examinations for the School of Continuing education of CUGB, {{there is an}} urgent need of the examination papers that have the parallel testing ability for the same academic program. Based on the analysis of parallel factors and the comparison of the manual generated mode and the computer generated mode, the most time-consuming and experience-consuming steps are found. By providing supports to those steps automatically, a semi-auto computer generated <b>testing</b> <b>paper</b> system was designed and developed for reducing the workload of the experienced faculties to generate <b>testing</b> <b>papers.</b> The papers were generated based on a gradually constructed item-bank. The system offered multiple templates of the <b>testing</b> <b>paper</b> structure plan for assisting semi-auto paper generated procedure and guaranteeing the parallel of the generated papers. In order to construct an item-bank in a short time, an easy-to-use authoring tool with powerful functions was designed and developed. The system supported the spring entrance examination of SCECUGB in 2010 successfully. Faculties gave positive feedback toward the system.

2500|$|It {{appeared}} as if Knox {{had found his}} niche, as he published follow up articles on the Cube Imitation Test and other intelligence tests to be used at Ellis Island. In late 1913, he published a short article as a follow up of the original Cube Imitation <b>Test</b> <b>paper,</b> in which he introduced a new form board, which normally developing six-year-olds were reportedly easily able to complete. He argued that adults who {{were not able to}} complete the task in the same time as six-year-olds should be classified as Imbeciles; thus, it was called the Imbecile Test [...] In this article he also introduced another test, which he called the Moron test, which was also a form board that could be completed by ten-year-olds rather quickly, and thus, adults who could not complete this test in {{the same amount of time}} were determined to be morons. [...] In this article he argued that normally developing six [...] In 1914, he published an article that addressed the issue of examining intelligence in emigrants over the age of 12. Through 1914, Knox published a number of articles in which he introduced various tests used at Ellis Island, as well as various batteries or combinations of tests used together, including the Construction Blocks Test, the Knox-Kempf profile test (also known as the Feature Profile Test), and the Ship Test, as well as a series of tests that could be used as make up tests for adults who had failed their original round of mental age tests. On his series of make-up tests, Knox also introduced the idea that various start points should be implemented on tests involving tasks which could be reportedly mastered at various ages; specifically, if an individual was assumed to be at a mental age of 9, they should begin the series of tests on the item that was ostensibly able to be successfully completed by a nine year old.|$|E

A platina wire one twelfth of an inch in diameter, weighing two hundred and sixty grains, had the extremity rendered plain, so as to offer a definite surface equal to a circle of the same diameter as the wire; it was then connected in turn with the conductor of the machine, or with the voltaic apparatus (369.), so as always to form the positive pole, {{and at the same}} time retain a perpendicular position, that it might rest, with its whole weight, upon the <b>test</b> <b>paper</b> to be employed. The <b>test</b> <b>paper</b> itself was supported upon a platina spatula, connected either with the discharging train (292.), or with the negative wire of the voltaic apparatus, and it consisted of four thicknesses, moistened at all times to an equal degree in a standard solution of hydriodate of potassa (316.).|$|E

Then by shifting the end of the wire from place to place upon the <b>test</b> <b>paper,</b> the effect of the current for five, six, seven, or any number of the beats of the watch (369.) was observed, and compared with that of the machine. After alternating and repeating the experiments of comparison many times, it was constantly found that this standard current of voltaic electricity, continued for eight beats of the watch, was equal, in chemical effect, to thirty turns of the machine; twenty-eight revolutions of the machine were sensibly too few.|$|E
