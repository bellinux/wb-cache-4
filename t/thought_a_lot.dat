He was thinking about Albert Camus, and about work as meaning in and of itself. At the same time, Dimitris Papaioannou concentrated deeply on simplicity, interaction with real materials, and silence — musically-composed silence.|$|E
500|$|In the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four-stars, saying [...] "Tomorrow Never Dies gets the job done, {{sometimes}} excitingly, often with style" [...] with the villain [...] "slightly more contemporary and plausible than usual", bringing [...] "some subtler-than-usual satire into the film". James Berardinelli described it as [...] "the best Bond film in many years" [...] and said Brosnan [...] "inhabits his character with a suave confidence that is very like Connery's." [...] However, in the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan <b>thought</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of Tomorrow Never Dies had a [...] "stodgy, been-there feeling", with little change from previous films, and Charles Taylor wrote for Salon.com that the film was [...] "a flat, impersonal affair".|$|E
500|$|... "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] {{has been}} {{performed}} more than 600 times by U2. It was first heard by a live audience in December 1982 in Glasgow, Scotland, on a twenty-one show [...] "Pre-War Tour." [...] The band were particularly nervous about playing {{the song in}} Belfast, Northern Ireland. Introducing the song there at the Maysfield Leisure Centre, Bono stated [...] "It's not a rebel song.", attempted to further clarify this point by reciting the entire second verse ("Broken bottles under children's feet ..."), and added as a final note, [...] "If you don't like it, you let us know." [...] The crowd overwhelmingly enjoyed the song; the Edge recalls that [...] "the place went nuts, it drew a really positive reaction.", also saying that [...] "We <b>thought</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about the song before we played it in Belfast and Bono told the audience that if they didn't like it then we'd never play it again. Out of the 3,000 people in the hall about three walked out. I think that {{says a lot about}} the audience's trust in us." [...] The band remained apprehensive, however. Even by the song's sixth performance, Bono was introducing the song with the statement [...] "This song is not a rebel song." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{graphics}} received mixed opinions from critics. Rick Sanchez of IGN felt {{disappointed with}} the game's visuals, opining that its graphics had not changed since he had played it at E3 2001. Sanchez stated that the game looked like an [...] "early first generation PS2 game", and asserted that had it been released a year from writing his review, the graphics would not have looked as dated. Louis Bedigan from GameZone praised the game's attention to detail, stating that the game's visuals had improved by [...] "110%" [...] since Wipeout 3 and <b>thought</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time was put into Wipeout Fusions graphics, resulting in [...] "something truly extraordinary". John Kauderer of GameSpy praised the game's key improvements over its predecessor – in particular its cutting edge graphic design, stating that it [...] "sets [...] worlds apart from the tired side scrollers and kiddy characters that populated the 16-bit systems". A reviewer from GamePro enjoyed the game's [...] "slickly renovated" [...] graphics. Ryan Davis of GameSpot criticised the game's visuals, asserting that although the track designs appear more [...] "flamboyant" [...] over Wipeout 2097, the game [...] "keeps its visual flash to a minimum". Additionally, Davis also expressed disappointment in the lack of awe-inspiring tracks, {{as well as the}} game's occasional slowdown and graphical pop-up issues. In contrast, Tom Bramwell from Eurogamer considered that Wipeout Fusions only improvement from its predecessors was its improved graphics engine.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{felt this}} was one of his {{favorite}} episodes to write, as he found it interesting to explore how the character of Fox Mulder would react to the death of his father. Carter had recently lost a parent himself when he began work on the episode. Frank Spotnitz said of the episode [...] "The expectations were very high coming after a summer's worth of anticipation to see how Mulder got out of the boxcar. We knew we had to answer that question and still leave an intriguing enough dilemma {{at the end of the}} show to bring viewers back for the third and final part. I also thought it was a big gamble to do all that Indian mysticism stuff. I <b>thought</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people would not necessarily respond to that. So I was nervous about that, but very excited about the Scully storyline and the way all of that played out with Mulder and Skinner." [...] Carter attended Navajo chants and rituals to ensure the accuracy of the events in this episode, after being alerted to inaccuracies in the previous episode by Navajo scholars. A sand painter was brought in to create the two sand paintings for the Blessing Way sequence, which took an entire day to create. The scenes set in New Mexico were filmed in the same Vancouver quarry that had been used as a stand-in in the previous episode, [...] "Anasazi", the repainting of which required only minor touch-ups.|$|E
500|$|The Orkneyinga saga {{states that}} Ölvir {{was the son}} of Þorljót, from Rekavík. The 19th-century {{historian}} Joseph Anderson was of the opinion that Rekavík likely refers to Rackwick on the island of Hoy, Orkney; or possibly, but less likely, to Rackwick on the island of Westray, Orkney. The saga states that Ölvir's mother was Þorljót's wife, Steinnvör 'the Stout'. Ölvir's parents had several other children in the saga: sons Magnús, Ormr, Moddan, Eindriði; and daughter Auðhildr. Steinnvör's mother is given as Frakökk; her father was Frakökk's husband, Ljótr 'Villain', from Sutherland. The saga states that Frakökk was a daughter of Moddan, a wealthy and noble farmer from i Dali, [...] "Dale". According to 21st-century historian Gareth Williams, this probably refers to a dale within the [...] "Dales of Caithness". The 21st-century historian Barbara Crawford stated that the Dales of Caithness refer to [...] "that part of Caithness which includes the river valleys running down towards the Pentland Firth". The saga records that another daughter of Moddan's was Helga, who was the concubine of the Orcadian earl, Hákon Pálsson, and the mother of the earl's son, Earl Haraldr Hákonsson. According to the saga, Frakökk's brothers included: Engus 'the Generous'; and Earl Óttarr, from Thurso, who is described as [...] "a man worthy of honour". The saga declares that the descendants of Moddan [...] "were high-born and <b>thought</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of themselves", and Williams suggested that they could be related to a powerful dynasty in the Irish Sea zone that included an Óttarr who seized control of the Kingdom of Dublin in 1142. Williams noted that Frakökk appears {{as one of the great}} villains of the Orkneyinga saga. Williams noted that while some of Moddan's descendants had legitimate claims for the earldom, Frakökk did not—however, she made a claim on behalf of her descendants, specifically Ölvir.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout his life, Gimblett's {{personality}} {{was inclined}} to be morose and depressive, and there is evidence from across his cricket career of a gulf between his entertaining cricket style and his own personal negativism.
