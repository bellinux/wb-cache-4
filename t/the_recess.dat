40|$|In this article, {{a linear}} dynamic {{characteristic}} model of <b>the</b> <b>recessed</b> chamber in a gas–liquid shear coaxial injector is developed. The gaseous injector flow before <b>the</b> <b>recessed</b> chamber {{is considered to}} be steady, and we just investigate the response of pressure drop across <b>the</b> <b>recessed</b> chamber to <b>the</b> mass flow rate fluctuation of the liquid injector. The transfer function of <b>the</b> <b>recessed</b> chamber is obtained, considering the distribute characteristics of liquid droplets within <b>the</b> <b>recessed</b> chamber. <b>The</b> results show that the amplitude of pressure drop pulsation would decrease as the liquid flow pulsation frequency increases, when the variation of liquid velocity is not taken into account. While considering the variation of liquid velocity, the result is opposite. The amplitude of pressure drop oscillation on the boundary of <b>the</b> <b>recessed</b> chamber increases with the increase in liquid velocity oscillation frequency...|$|R

The motion was adopted, and the convention took a four-hour recess until 5:00 P.M. After <b>the</b> <b>recess,</b> a motion was made for the Committee on Rules to be directed to report, but a substitute motion from George H.

5|$|Whether counsel are {{appointed}} or retained, the Clause protects {{the role of}} counsel and certain attributes of the attorney-client relationship. For example, the Clause requires that the defendant be given time to consult with counsel and that counsel be given time to investigate the case pre-trial. And, the Clause also prohibits a state from barring a defendant from being cross-examined by counsel, or restricting {{the order in which}} the defendant may be called as a witness. Further, the court may not prevent a defendant from consulting with her counsel during an overnight recess, even if <b>the</b> <b>recess</b> bisects direct- and cross-examination of the defendant. Similarly, the defendant has a right to have her counsel make a closing argument, even if a bench trial.|$|E
5|$|Cotto {{returned}} to action on February 21, 2009, in a card {{held at the}} Madison Square Garden, sporting {{the first of his}} trademark tattoos which he has expanded on ever since. This time competing against Michael Jennings for the vacant WBO welterweight title. After both pugilists used the first round to study their opponent's style, the tempo accelerated during the second. In the third, Cotto pursued the offensive more fluidly, connecting with jabs and hooks. One round later, Cotto scored two knockdowns on Jennings, who was able to continue until <b>the</b> <b>recess.</b> In the fifth, Jennings was trapped against the ropes, which Cotto utilized to connect a right hook to score a third knockdown. Jennings incorporated, but the referee decided to stop the fight. With this action, Cotto was awarded a technical knockout victory, in the process winning his second championship in the welterweight division. On April 8, 2009, Cotto fired his uncle from the team's staff, following a violent discussion where his property was damaged. However, neither side expressed interest in pursuing any sort of legal action. Consequently, Cotto named Joe Santiago, who had served as the team's nutritionist as his new trainer.|$|E
40|$|Flush {{mounting}} of {{a sensor}} on a surface {{is provided by}} first forming a <b>recessed</b> area on <b>the</b> surface. Next, an adhesive bonding mixture is introduced into <b>the</b> <b>recessed</b> area. <b>The</b> adhesive bonding mixture is chosen to provide thermal expansion matching with the surface surrounding <b>the</b> <b>recessed</b> area. A strip of high performance polymeric tape is provided, with the sensor attached to the underside thereof, and the tape is positioned over <b>the</b> <b>recessed</b> area so that it acts as a carrier of the sensor. A shim having flexibility {{so that it will}} conform to the surface surrounding <b>the</b> <b>recessed</b> area is placed over the tape, and a vacuum pad is placed over the shim. The area above the surface is then evacuated while holding the sensor flush with the surface during curing of the adhesive bonding mixture. After such curing, the pad, shim, and tape are removed from the sensor, electrical connections for the sensor are provided, after which the remaining space in <b>the</b> <b>recessed</b> area is filled with a polymeric foam...|$|R
50|$|Surfaces {{can be made}} {{hydrophobic}} {{without the}} use of coating through the altering of their surface microscopic contours, as well. The basis of hydrophobicity is <b>the</b> creation of <b>recessed</b> areas on a surface whose wetting expends more energy than bridging <b>the</b> <b>recesses</b> expends. This so-called Wenzel-effect surface or lotus effect surface has less contact area by an amount proportional to <b>the</b> <b>recessed</b> area, giving it a high contact angle. <b>The</b> <b>recessed</b> surface has a proportionately diminished attraction foreign liquids or solids and permanently stays cleaner. This has been effectively used for roofs and curtain walls of structures that benefit from low or no maintenance.|$|R

5|$|As {{a strong}} proponent {{for a new}} constitution, White helped Queen Liliʻuokalani draft the 1893 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Nāwahī was the other {{principal}} author, and Samuel Nowlein, captain of the Household Guard, was another contributor. These three had been meeting with the queen in secret since August 1892 after attempts to abrogate the Bayonet Constitution by legislative decision through a constitutional convention had proved largely unsuccessful. The proposed constitution would increase {{the power of the}} monarchy, restore voting rights to economically disenfranchised Native Hawaiians and Asians, and remove the property qualification for suffrage imposed by the Bayonet Constitution, among other changes. On the afternoon of January14, after the knighting ceremony of White and Nāwahī and the prorogation of the legislature, members of Hui Kālaiʻāina and a delegation of native leaders marched to ʻIolani Palace with a sealed package containing the constitution. According to William DeWitt Alexander, this was pre-planned by the queen to take place while she met with her newly appointed cabinet ministers in the Blue Room of the palace. She was attempting to promulgate the constitution during <b>the</b> <b>recess</b> of the legislative assembly. However, these ministers, including Samuel Parker, William H. Cornwell, John F. Colburn, and Arthur P. Peterson, were either opposed to or reluctant to support the new constitution.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{gate of the}} {{fortress}} lies in the northwestern side of the outer ward, originally within a small recess in the outer curtain wall, protected by a portcullis. <b>The</b> <b>recess</b> was later filled by the Turks with a smaller set of walls, so as to preserve unbroken the outer wall's frontage. The Ottomans also added additional buttresses to the junctions of their wall with the original curtain wall, while {{the space between the}} original gate and the new, Ottoman entrance was left unroofed and open to the sky. From the gate, the outer wall continues east and then south, in three distinct stretches of walls, to the keep. The wall is built of limestone masonry, with little evidence of brick or tiles, topped by a small inner parapet and Ottoman-built crenellations, now largely ruined. From the beginning, buildings were built leaning on the outer wall, as evidenced by the remnant of their foundations, side walls joining the curtain wall's inner face, or the presence of fireplaces and lancet windows in the curtain wall. One of these buildings is largely preserved immediately next to the outer gate. Windows, fireplaces etc. display a uniformity of style that points to their construction {{at the same time as}} {{the fortress}} itself. At the point where the outer wall joins the keep, a small postern is located, as well as a stairway leading up to the outer wall's chemin de ronde.|$|E
