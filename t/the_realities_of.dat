5|$|Farm {{animals are}} {{widespread}} {{in books and}} songs for children; the reality of animal husbandry is often distorted, softened, or idealized, giving children an almost entirely fictitious account of farm life.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950s, {{reflecting}} {{both the}} threat of possible invasion by the Soviet Union and <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> nuclear warfare, Swiss military doctrine changed to that of a dynamic (mobile) defense that included missions for the Swiss Air Force outside of its territory, in order to defeat standoff attacks and nuclear threats, including the possibility of defensive employment of air-delivered nuclear weapons.

5|$|Recorded {{throughout}} 2003, Blink-182 marks {{a departure}} from the band's earlier work, infusing experimental elements into their usual pop punk sound. These elements were inspired by lifestyle changes (the band members all became fathers before the album was released) and side projects. Its songs are characterized by downcast and expansive sonic atmospheres, showcasing what critics dubbed a more elaborate, mature side of the band. Songwriting is more personal in nature and explores darker territory, touching upon <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> adulthood and unexpected hardships. The record features a collaboration with The Cure frontman Robert Smith.|$|E

30|$|Images {{produce a}} <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> their own. This {{specific}} reality cannot be grasped by dualistically separating {{it from an}} alleged <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> ‘the factual’. We can clearly see this effect of creating an ‘own’ <b>reality</b> in works <b>of</b> art of abstract modernism displaying something which eludes objective, measurable and countable approaches. What is displayed by these images points to meaning (or emotion) rather than matter. This implicit meaning of the image is perceived as <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image. From an epistemological perspective, <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image and <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factual are incongruent and disparate (Schütz 2016 a, 2016 b). <b>The</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image with its inherent logic and materiality can become tangible precisely in this incongruity. From an epistemological point <b>of</b> view, <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image is not only perceived as reality, but also responded to immediately. The multitude of experiences which are constituted while looking at an image are immediate responses {{to the meaning of}} the image. <b>The</b> inherent, experiential <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image is grounded in this pre-verbal and implicit meaning.|$|R

After having firmly established his auteur status with these films, Kim's unique vision began to wane in his films of the later 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The cadet pledge was {{considered}} a statement of intention rather than a binding contract. The attrition rate for cadets was comparable to that reported for other schools of nursing in the same period.

5000|$|Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi had {{originally}} declared <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quran (haqiqat-i quran) and <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ka'ba (haqiqat-i ka'ba-yi rabbani) {{to be above}} <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> Muhammad (haqiqat-i Muhammadi). This caused fury of opposition, particularly among certain sufis and ulama of Hijaz who objected to the Ka'ba having exalted spiritual [...] "rank" [...] than the Prophet. Sirhindi argued in response that <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prophet is superior to any creature. The real Ka'ba is worthy of prostration since it is not created and is covered with the veil of nonexistence. It is this Ka'ba in the essence of God that Sirhindi was referring to as <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ka'ba, not {{the appearance of the}} Ka'ba (surat-i ka'ba), which is only a stone.

Elvis Presley was drafted, Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran died in 1959 and 1960 respectively, Chuck Berry was in jail, and Jerry Lee Lewis had been disgraced by press reports that he married his 13-year-old cousin. Music and culture critic Nelson George disagrees with music historians who attest {{the last two years}} of the 1950s were barren of talent, {{pointing}} to Charles and this song in particular. George writes that the themes in Charles' work were very similar to the young rebels who popularized rock and roll, writing By breaking down the division between pulpit and bandstand, recharging blues concerns with transcendental fervor, unashamedly linking the spiritual and the sexual, Charles made pleasure (physical satisfaction) and joy (divine enlightenment) seem the same thing. By doing so he brought <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> the Saturday-night sinner and Sunday-morning worshipper—so often one and the same—into raucous harmony.|$|E
5|$|Keable {{eventually}} achieved {{his wish}} {{of going to}} war in 1917, when a South African contingent was mustered for military service in France and Keable volunteered {{to go with them}} as chaplain. His experiences there were to form the basis for his first and most successful novel, Simon Called Peter. Appointed an army chaplain on 26 May 1917, Keable travelled to the Rouen sector with a Native Labour Contingent of 21,000 men. These men were paid £3 per month to unload supply ships and provide infrastructure support for military operations in Europe. As a chaplain, with the rank of captain, Keable was expected to be at the disposal of the army at large, and ministered to those seeing active infantry service as well as to labourers. Padres were formally required to remain behind the lines, but it is apparent that Keable nonetheless saw something of <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> the frontline.|$|E

Later that same week on the April 15 episode of SmackDown, Edge officially relinquished the World Heavyweight Championship, retiring as the World Champion {{in the process of}} recapping his announcement and expressing gratitude over this happening now rather than it being too late.|$|E

5|$|Van Gogh's stylistic {{developments}} are usually {{linked to the}} periods he spent living in different places across Europe. He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout. His evolution as an artist was slow, and {{he was aware of}} his painterly limitations. He moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill. Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes, and that Van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> his then current situation.|$|E

5|$|In the Malaysian case Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan (1996), the {{appellant}} had appealed {{against his}} wrongful dismissal from employment {{on the grounds}} of procedural unfairness. One of the issues brought up was whether an unfair procedure meant that he had been deprived of his constitutional right to life or liberty protected by Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram held that the courts should take into consideration the unique characteristics and situation of the country, and must not be blind to <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> life. He went on to suggest that a liberal approach be adopted to grasp the intention of the framers of the Constitution by giving life a broad and liberal meaning. He opined that such an interpretation would include elements that form the quality of life, namely the right to seek and be engaged in lawful and gainful employment, and the right to live in a reasonably healthy and pollution-free environment. He also noted that life cannot be extinguished or taken away except according to procedure established by law.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1925 {{tensions}} between the Druze chiefs of the Hauran led by Sultan Pasha al-Atrash and the French authorities culminated with the Great Syrian Revolt, which spread throughout Syria within months. While Quwatli's Istiqlal Party lobbied the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini {{to set up a}} financial support network for the rebellion, Quwatli had already secured the funneling of funds and arms from the Hejaz and also diverted some of the military aid to the Jerusalem-based committee. As the revolt's initial momentum began to recede in mid-1926, bickering between opposition leaders, inside and outside of Syria, increased significantly. Quwatli was accused by his rivals in Cairo of pocketing some money he raised and paying off rebels to prevent rebel raids against his family's extensive apricot orchards in the Ghouta. Tensions between Istiqlalists like Quwatli and Arslan and other Syrian nationalist leaders like al-Bakri and Shahbandar, were particularly sharp, with the latter accusing Quwatli of being out of touch from <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> the revolt, and Quwatli accusing Shahbandar of treason for attempting to stop the insurrection.|$|E
5|$|Political realism {{formed the}} basis of Kennan's work as a diplomat and {{historian}} and remains relevant to the debate over American foreign policy, which since the 19th century has been characterized by a shift from the Founding Fathers' realist school to the idealistic or Wilsonian school of international relations. According to the realist tradition, security is based on the principle of a balance of power, whereas Wilsonianism (considered impractical by realists) relies on morality as the sole determining factor in statecraft. According to the Wilsonians the spread of democracy abroad as a foreign policy is important and morals are valid universally. During the Presidency of Bill Clinton, American diplomacy represented the Wilsonian school {{to such a degree that}} those in favor of the realism likened President Clinton's policies to social work. According to Kennan, whose concept of American diplomacy was based on the realist approach, such moralism without regard to <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> power and the national interest is self-defeating and will result in the decrease of American power.|$|E
