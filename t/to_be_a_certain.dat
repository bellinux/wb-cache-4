Slower-growing but more heat-tolerant corals have become more common. The changes in temperature and acclimation are complex. Some reefs in current shadows represent a refugium location {{that will help them}} adjust to the disparity in the environment even if eventually the temperatures may rise more quickly there than in other locations. This separation of populations by climatic barriers causes a realized niche to shrink greatly in comparison to the old fundamental niche.|$|E
5|$|The first EC-137 {{made its}} maiden flight on 9 February 1972, with the fly-off {{between the two}} radars taking place during March–July that year. Favorable test results led to the {{selection}} of Westinghouse's radar for the production aircraft. Hughes's radar was initially thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> winner, simply because much of its design was also going into the new F-15 Eagle's radar program. The Westinghouse radar used a pipelined fast fourier transform (FFT) to digitally resolve 128 Doppler frequencies, while Hughes's radars used analog filters based on the design for the F-15 fighter. Westinghouse's engineering team won this competition by using a programmable 18-bit computer whose software could be modified before each mission. This computer was the AN/AYK-8 design from the B-57G program, and designated AYK-8-EP1 for its much expanded memory. This radar also multiplexed a beyond-the-horizon (BTH) pulse mode that could complement the pulse-Doppler radar mode. This proved to be beneficial especially when the BTH mode is used to detect ships at sea when the radar beam is directed below the horizon.|$|E

The 14 May affair {{ended in a}} 1–1 draw between the two camps as the Rapids' Drew Moor netted a 23rd-minute brace to give the visitors an advantage. The hosts, United, continued to press throughout the match, dominating possession. In the 56th minute, what seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> foul in the box for a penalty from Colorado's Jeff Lorentowictz on D.C.'s Joseph Ngwenya was waved off, resulting in heavy dissent from both {{the players and the}} bench of United. The incident was seemingly hindered in the 62nd minute when the Rapids' Kosuke Kimura collided with United's Chris Pontius. Pontius would subsequently score from the penalty spot, leveling the scoreline and thus giving United a draw.|$|E
