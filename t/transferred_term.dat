As {{the values of the}} <b>transfer</b> <b>term</b> and Coulomb interactions increase, various soliton states tend to have energies close to one another. It is suggested that the neutral soliton of two-site type is the lowest-energy defect state in a certain range of the strengths of those perturbations. This situation is consistent with the results of the ultraviolet-induced EPR experiment in [Pt(en) 2][Pt(en) 2 Cl 2](ClO 4) 4 (with en=ethylenediamine).

40|$|It {{is noted}} that several {{terms in the}} {{two-point}} spectral equation for homogeneous turbulence {{can be interpreted as}} spectral-transfer terms; that is, they represent the net rate of energy transfer into a wavenumber region from all other wavenumbers. This holds for terms associated with both turbulence and self-interaction and interaction between turbulence and mean gradients. It is not seen as obvious, however, that similar interpretations apply when the turbulence is not homogeneous. In particular, one might question the interpretation for the terms associated with turbulence self-interaction because the condition of homegeneity is generally used in making the interpretation.

Direct numerical simulations are conducted for moderate and rapid rotation rates and comparisons are made with the predictions of generalized Eddy Damped Quasi-Normal Markovian (EDQNM) approximations. It is shown that at high rotation rates the nonlinear <b>transfer</b> <b>terms</b> remain small and {{that the development of}} the spectrum is through pure viscous decay. This shows that the effect of rapid rotation on the turbulence kinetic energy is through the shutting off of the production term in the dissipation rate equation. At moderate and relatively rapid rates, the rotation causes a discernible anisotropy to develop in the integral length scale with a mild trend toward a two-dimensionalization of the flow. As the flow decays, the Rossby number decreases, leading again to the shutting off of the nonlinear <b>transfer</b> <b>terms.</b> For extremely rapid rotation rates, the anisotropies in the integral length scales are small and direct numerical simulation results are in good agreement with rapid distortion theory...|$|R

40|$|The {{interphase}} {{transfer of}} turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) {{is an important}} term that affects the evolution of TKE in fluid and particle phases in particle-laden turbulent flow. This work shows that the interphase TKE <b>transfer</b> <b>terms</b> must obey a mathematical constraint, which in the limiting case of statistically homogeneous flow with zero mean velocity in both phases, requires these terms be equal and opposite. In the single-point statistical approach called the two-fluid theory, the interphase TKE <b>transfer</b> <b>terms</b> are unclosed {{and need to be}} modeled. Multiphase turbulencemodels that satisfy this constraint of conservative interphase TKE transfer admit a term-by-term comparison with true direct numerical simulations (DNS) that enforce the exact velocityboundary condition on each particle’s surface. Analysis of three models reveals that not all models satisfy the requirement of conservative interphase TKE transfer. DNS that invoke the point-particle assumption also do not obey this principle of conservative interphase TKE transfer, and this precludes the comparison of model predictions of TKE budgets in each phase with point-particle DNS. This study motivates the development of multiphase turbulencemodels based on the insights revealed by this analysis, leading to a meaningful comparison of TKE budgets with true DNS...|$|R

The main contribution of the work presented here is the new formulation to account SLR correlations in ISO 13790, obtained for sunspaces, but generalizable for other solar systems with known SLR functions. Simulation models are used to perform a sensitivity analysis of internal gains and heat transfer through solar collector surfaces, both issues that distinguishes ISO 13790 from Load Ratio methods. The analysis shows that internal gains {{can be added to}} the heat source term or subtracted to heat <b>transfer</b> <b>term</b> without influencing the utilization factor dependence with the gain-to-loss ratio. On the other hand, the SLR assumption that solar collector surfaces are neutral elements and, therefore, not added to the heat <b>transfer</b> <b>term,</b> results in large inconsistencies between SLR and ISO 13790 methods. The detailed monthly methodology of ISO 13790 fairly reproduces results obtained by simulation.

Upconversion dynamics of Er$ sp{ 3 +}$:YAP, and Er$ sp{ 3 +}$:YAG are analyzed by a rate equation model which includes four energy transfer processes. It was found that good fits to the experimental data can be achieved only when the fourth power activator concentration dependent energy <b>transfer</b> <b>terms</b> (when the energy transfer is fourth order kinetically) {{are included in the}} rate equation. To study avalanche upconversion dynamics of Tm$ sp{ 3 +}$:YLF measurements of the time dependent upconversion luminescence intensity were made under different pumping wavelengths and different pumping powers at both low temperature and room temperature. The pumping power dependent upconversion luminescence was also measured. To describe the avalanche upconversion dynamics a rate equation model which includes both the cross-relaxation and energy transfer processes was developed. Satisfactory fits or simulations of the experimental data were obtained in every case. Through this work {{it was found that the}} energy <b>transfer</b> <b>term</b> is proportional to the second power of the activator concentration (second order kinetically) at low activator concentration and proportional to the fourth power of the activator concentration (fourth order kinetically) at high activator concentration.

40|$|The {{interfacial}} <b>transfer</b> <b>terms</b> {{are important}} for modeling the dynamic coupling between the phases in a two-fluid formulation. The geometric factor of these <b>transfer</b> <b>terms</b> is recognized by the interfacial area concentration. An independent experimental study of the interfacial structure in adiabatic two-phase flow {{was carried out in}} a 25. 4 mm ID pipe. The local void fraction, interfacial area concentration, interfacial velocity, bubble frequency, and Sauter mean diameter were measured by a double-sensor probe. The flow structure development was visualized by measuring the radial distribution of these phasic parameters at three axial locations (L/D = 12, 62, and 112). More detailed measurements in the fully developed flow were conducted at L/D = 120. The interfacial structure was measured by the double- and four-sensor probes. Other parameters such as the Taylor bubble film thickness, bubble length, and slug unit length in the slug flow regime were measured by a thin-film probe. ^ A simplified one-dimension interfacial area concentration transport equation with only the coalescence sink term was presented. An analytical solution was obtained by using a self-similarity transformation. A set of data of interfacial area concentration decay from the flow development study was used to compare with the model predictions. The coalescence rate was determined by the results of the experimental results. ^ For the interfacial momentum transfer, a multiparticle drag law was used to model the interfacial momentum <b>transfer</b> <b>term.</b> This term appeared in both gas and liquid momentum balance equations. In order to solve the momentum equations, it was necessary to close the system equations with a two-phase turbulent model and to set the boundary condition by a wall friction factor. An empirical mixing length model was proposed and computed from the experimental data obtained from the literature. The wall friction was calculated by the homogeneous equilibrium mixture model. The predicted gas and liquid velocities were compared with the experimental results. The gas and liquid velocities were measured by the double-sensor probe and hot-film anemometer, respectively. The model overpredicted the gas velocity in all cases. This is an indication that a higher interfacial drag is felt by individual bubble in the dispersed flow. ...|$|R
