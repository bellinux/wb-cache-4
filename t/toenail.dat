5|$|On January 8, 2009, an 18-year-old male {{member of}} Anonymous {{ran into the}} New York Scientology {{building}} shirtless and covered with Vaseline, pubic hair, and <b>toenail</b> clippings. He then proceeded to toss books around and smear the mixture on objects in the building. The man, identified by police as Mahoud Samed Almahadin, was charged with burglary, criminal mischief, and aggravated harassment as hate crimes. Two weeks later, 21-year-old film student and Anonymous member Jacob Speregen was charged with aggravated harassment and criminal mischief as hate crimes after he filmed Almahadin carrying out his prank. According {{to his mother and}} the video, Speregen was filming the event from behind the barricade. Scientology critics Mark Bunker and Jason Beghe disagreed with the individual's actions.|$|E
5|$|From 1277, Stratton {{acted in}} the {{capacity}} as Countess Isabella's steward, though he never officially used that title. It was in this post that he committed {{some of his most}} grievous offences. In 1278 he was accused of cutting off the seal of a charter from Quarr Abbey, thereby invalidating its authenticity. As a result, several other similar cases were brought to light, but none led to conviction. It was widely believed that he had bought himself off with bribes. Stratton's transgressions continued however, and by the late 1280s the complaints reached King Edward I. Edward returned from a prolonged stay in Gascony in late 1289, and immediately started a purge of corruption in the royal administration, including proceedings against Ralph de Hengham, Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Stratton was relieved of his office of chamberlain, along with his temporal possessions, on 17 January 1290. On his arrest, £12,666 17s 7d was found in his possession, a vast sum at the time, equivalent to about £ in present-day terms. According to the chronicle of Bartholomew Cotton, a silk-lined chest was also discovered, containing fingernail and <b>toenail</b> clippings, women's pubic hair, and feet of toads and moles. These were considered the ingredients of witchcraft, and the box was sealed up by officials, but Stratton managed to break the seal and throw the contents down a latrine.|$|E

50|$|When <b>toenailing,</b> nails can {{be driven}} {{from the inside}} or outside of the joint, {{depending}} on access available to use the hammer. Skew nailing is also a technique used by other woodworkers, for example a drawer or box can be glued and skew-nailed with finer nails or panel pins. Skew nailing will fasten the joint, while the glue sets, avoiding the use of clamps. A variation of <b>toenailing</b> is to use screws for the same purpose, which might be called <b>toenailing</b> or toe-screwing.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The authors {{describe}} a clinical {{case of a}} 5 -year-old girl with history of thickening and yellow discoloration of the great <b>toenails</b> with lateral deviation, since her first month of life. The patient was diagnosed with congenital malalignment of the great <b>toenails.</b> The congenital malalignment of the great <b>toenails</b> was first described as a nosological entity in 1983, by Baran et al. It is a nail disorder in which the nail plates are laterally deviated {{with respect to the}} longitudinal axis of the distal phalanx. Other additional clinical features include yellow-green discoloration, transverse ridging (Beau lines) and thickening with dystrophy...|$|R
25|$|The {{common opinion}} is that the nail enters inside the paronychium, but an ingrown <b>toenail</b> can simply be {{overgrown}} toe skin. The condition starts from a microbial inflammation of the paronychium, then a granuloma, which results in a nail buried inside of the granuloma. While ingrown nails can occur in the nails of both the hands and the feet , they occur most commonly with the toenails.|$|E
25|$|In 1848, Hannah Greener, a 15-year-old {{girl who}} was having an {{infected}} <b>toenail</b> removed, died after being given the anesthetic. Her autopsy establishing {{the cause of death}} was undertaken by John Fife assisted by Robert Mortimer Glover. A number of physically fit patients died after inhaling it. However, in 1848 John Snow developed an inhaler that regulated the dosage and so successfully reduced the number of deaths.|$|E
25|$|A {{horseshoe}} is a fabricated product, normally made of metal, although sometimes made partially or wholly {{of modern}} synthetic materials, {{designed to protect}} a horse's hoof from wear. Shoes are attached on the palmar surface (ground side) of the hooves, usually nailed through the insensitive hoof wall that is anatomically akin to the human <b>toenail,</b> although much larger and thicker. However, there are also cases where shoes are glued.|$|E

25|$|Injuries due to toe {{misalignment}} {{are often}} avoided by adjusting toe alignments with gel toe spacers. <b>Toenail</b> bruising {{can be caused}} by heavy pressure {{on the surface of the}} nail; this is typically prevented by keeping toenails clipped short, by wrapping tape around the toes, by using padding, or combinations of these. Bruising can also occur on the tips of the toes, especially when no padding is used. It is highly unadvised to dance en pointe without any padding at all.|$|E
25|$|Hand, foot, {{and mouth}} disease (HFMD) {{is a common}} {{infection}} caused {{by a group of}} viruses. It typically begins with a fever and feeling generally unwell. This is followed a day or two later by flat discolored spots or bumps that may blister, on the hands, feet, and mouth, and occasionally buttocks and groin. Signs and symptoms normally appear 3–6 days after exposure to the virus. The rash generally goes away on its own in about a week. Fingernail and <b>toenail</b> loss may occur a few weeks later, but will regrow with time.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{treatment}} for an ingrown nail {{is carried out}} by a podiatrist, a foot and ankle specialist. This is typically an in-office procedure requiring local anesthesia and special surgical instruments. The surgical approach is {{the removal of the}} offending part of the nail plate known as a wedge resection. If the ingrown <b>toenail</b> recurs despite this treatment, destruction of the sides of the nail with chemicals or excision is done; this is known as a matrixcestomy. Antibiotics may be used after the procedure but are not recommended, as they may delay healing. Surgical {{treatment for}} ingrown nails is more effective at preventing the nail from regrowing inwards compared to non-surgical treatments.|$|E
