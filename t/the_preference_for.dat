5|$|Another {{instance}} of population control is {{the prevalence of}} female infanticide. People in rural areas practiced female infanticide and selective neglect due to a preference of sons over daughters. Since the 1980s, roughly 200,000 female infants would be killed per year because of <b>the</b> <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> male children and the advancement in technologies such as ultrasound, which help {{to find out the}} sex of the fetus. In addition to female infanticide, girls are being unregistered or are abandoned by their families, which stops them from receiving education and legal benefits the government offered. These methods of controlling population have resulted in a huge gender gap in China.|$|E
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} <b>the</b> <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> language use and modes of learning of university students who were completing undergraduate degrees in Australia. Of the sixty students surveyed, forty percent were international students. For seventy five percent of all students sampled, either they or their parents (or both) were bi- or multilingual. Questions which this research sought to answer were: Do <b>the</b> <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> learning of university students differ according to the culture and / or language backgrounds of the students? Does an individual student’s preferred learning style influence <b>the</b> student’s <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> learning in a group situation? For students whose first language is not English, do their <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> language use vary in group learning? General findings resulting from a statistical analysis of responses to the questionnaire indicated in many, but not all, cases that <b>the</b> <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> learning of university students differed according to the cultural and / or language backgrounds of the students, that an individual student’s preferred learning style influenced <b>the</b> student’s <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> learning in a group situation, and that <b>the</b> <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> language use of students whose first language was not English varied in group learning. Reid’s (1984 in Richards, J. C. & Lockhart, C., 1994) “Perceptual learning style preference questionnaire” comprised {{one section of the}} questionnaire for this study. This replication made possible a comparison of the findings which related to students’ learning styles from this study with findings from similar studies in which Reid’s survey instrument had been used. Findings of the present study indicate a number of differences from Reid’s findings. This study found, for example, that most language groups showed a minor <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> group learning using this survey instrument whereas Reid had found that group learning was a negligible <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> most of <b>the</b> language groups in her study. This study may give tertiary educators a greater understanding of their students’ <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> group and other learning styles. It may also inform them of <b>the</b> likely <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> language use of those of their students who have first languages other than English.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> sons over {{daughters in}} India {{is rooted in}} social, {{economic}} and religious reasons. Women are often believed to be of a lower value in society due to their non-breadwinner status. Financial support, old age security, property inheritance, dowry and beliefs surrounding religious duties all contribute to the preference of sons over daughters. One {{of the main reasons}} behind the preference of sons is the potential burden of having to find grooms for daughters. Families of women in India often have to pay a dowry and all expenses related to marriage in order to marry off a daughter, which increases the cost associated with having a daughter.|$|E
5|$|An 18th-century account {{suggests}} that females {{might have left}} their newborn calves in isolation and returned regularly to suckle them until the calves {{were old enough to}} join herds, which is similar to the behaviour of roan and sable antelopes. Akin to other grazing antelopes, the bluebuck probably calved mainly where rainfall, and thus the availability of grasses, peaked. Such locations could be the western margin of the CFR during winter and the eastern margin of the CFR during summer. Faith et al. 2013 found that the occurrence of juveniles in bluebuck fossils decreases linearly from the west to the east, indicating that most births took place in the western CFR; due to <b>the</b> <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> rainfall, it may be further assumed that most births occurred during winter, when the western CFR receives most of its rainfall. The annual west-to-east migration would have followed in summer, consistent with the greater number of adult juveniles in the east that would have joined herds. Juvenile fossils also occur in other places across the range, but appear to be concentrated in the western CFR.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters {{consume a}} wide range of insects; beyond a few distasteful {{butterflies}} they consume almost any insect from tiny Drosophila flies to large beetles and dragonflies. At some point bee-eaters have been recorded eating beetles, mayflies, stoneflies, cicadas, termites, crickets and grasshoppers, mantises, true flies and moths. For many species the dominant prey item are stinging members of the order Hymenoptera, namely wasps and bees. In a survey of 20 studies the proportion of the diet made up by bees and wasps varied from 20% to 96%, with the average being 70%. Of these honeybees can comprise {{a large part of the}} diet, as much as 89% of the overall intake. <b>The</b> <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> bees and wasps may have arisen because of the numerical abundance of these suitably sized insects. The giant honeybee is a particularly commonly eaten species. These bees attempt to congregate in a mass defence against the bee-eaters. In Israel, a European bee-eater was documented attempting to eat a small bat that it had caught, which probably couldn't fit down its throat.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBased on a Danish survey {{including}} {{respondents with}} on-shore viewshed experience and {{varying degrees of}} off-shore viewshed experience, it is estimated how {{the different types of}} wind power experience influence <b>the</b> <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> wind power, biomass energy and solar energy development in Denmark. <b>The</b> <b>preference</b> relations indicate that on-shore viewshed experience reduces <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> wind power by 6 % and increases <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> biomass and solar energy solutions relative to wind power by nearly 5 %. In contrast, off-shore viewshed experience increases <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> wind power relative to biomass energy by 24 %. However, the effect is dependent on the type of off-shore wind farm experience. Thus, experience of near-shore wind farms can reduce <b>the</b> <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> wind power. <b>The</b> results also suggest that wind turbines in the viewshed influence the relative preferences between solar energy and biomass energy...|$|R

The larger this income ratio, <b>the</b> lower <b>the</b> <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> social security (health care, retirement and unemployment) but <b>the</b> larger <b>the</b> <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> education spending.
