5|$|<b>Tea</b> <b>is</b> also {{a widely}} {{consumed}} beverage and is served at cafés and drunk at home. <b>Tea</b> <b>is</b> prepared in many ways, from plain brewed Russian and Turkish-style black tea with sugar, to tea with lemon or milk, and, {{available as a}} common option in most establishments, Middle Eastern-style with mint (nana).|$|E
5|$|Yellow tea: This <b>tea</b> <b>is</b> {{processed}} {{in a similar}} manner to green tea, but instead of immediate drying after fixation, it is stacked, covered, and gently heated in a humid environment. This initiates oxidation in the chlorophyll of the leaves through non-enzymatic and non-microbial means, which results in a yellowish or greenish-yellow colour.|$|E
5|$|Aging / Curing: While {{not always}} {{required}}, some teas required additional aging, secondary fermentation, or baking {{to reach their}} drinking potential. For instance, a green tea puerh, prior to curing into a post-fermented <b>tea,</b> <b>is</b> often bitter and harsh in taste, but becomes sweet and mellow through fermentation by age or dampness. Additionally, oolong can benefit from aging if fired over charcoal. Flavoured teas are manufactured in this stage by spraying the tea with aromas and flavours or by storing them with their flavorants.|$|E
50|$|Most {{fermented}} <b>teas</b> <b>are</b> made in China, {{but several}} varieties are produced in Japan. In Shan State, Myanmar, lahpet {{is a form}} of fermented <b>tea</b> that <b>is</b> eaten, and similar pickled <b>teas</b> <b>are</b> also eaten in northern Thailand and southern Yunnan.|$|R
50|$|Leaf <b>teas</b> <b>are</b> {{processed}} {{either by}} roasting or steaming. Roasted <b>tea</b> <b>are</b> also called pan-fried tea. Generally, roasted varieties are richer in flavor, while steamed varieties are more vivid in color.|$|R
50|$|Whisking: The {{powdered}} <b>tea</b> <b>was</b> {{mixed into}} {{hot water and}} frothed with a whisk before serving. The colour and patterns formed by the powdered <b>tea</b> <b>were</b> enjoyed while the mixture was imbibed.|$|R
5|$|<b>Tea</b> <b>is</b> {{the second}} most {{consumed}} beverage in the world, after water. Argo was founded {{in response to a}} realization that Americans had so few tea offerings that they generally were unfamiliar with anything but bagged teas. At the time, most tea retailers either supplied bulk tea for home brewing or traditional sit-down service, but Argo focused on premium specialty drinks in paper cups. Meanwhile, a minority of Asian immigrants from countries such as India, Vietnam and China where <b>tea</b> <b>is</b> the national beverage were spreading some of their traditions. Argo endeavored to emphasize the healthy aspects of tea as an alternative to coffee. When it was founded, Argo was part of a field of blossoming tea cafe franchises meeting a burgeoning demand. By 2002, there were 1,100 tearooms with sit-down service. In 2003, retail sales of tea totaled $5.1billion, and in 2005, as the specialty tea market was growing 20percent per year, the total retail tea market was expected to surpass $10 billion by 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{recorded}} {{history of the}} town starts from the early 19th century when the colonial administration under the British Raj set up a sanatorium and a military depot in the region. Subsequently, extensive tea plantations were established {{in the region and}} tea growers developed hybrids of black tea and created new fermentation techniques. The resultant distinctive Darjeeling <b>tea</b> <b>is</b> internationally recognised and ranks among the most popular black teas in the world.|$|E
5|$|Two hot {{beverages}} that Palestinians consume is coffee—served in {{the morning}} and throughout the day—and tea which is often sipped in the evening. <b>Tea</b> <b>is</b> usually flavored with na'ana (mint) or maramiyyeh (sage). The coffee of choice is usually Turkish or Arabic coffee. Arabic coffee is similar to Turkish coffee, but the former is spiced with cardamom and is usually unsweetened.|$|E
50|$|Despite often being {{considered}} of mediocre quality, hyson <b>tea</b> <b>was</b> highly prized by the 18th century British and tea tax on hyson <b>tea</b> <b>was</b> {{higher than for}} other teas. During the Boston Tea Party hyson tea represented 15 {{of the more than}} three hundred chests of <b>tea</b> that <b>were</b> destroyed.|$|R
5000|$|Korean <b>teas</b> <b>were</b> {{divided into}} the five {{different}} tastes: bitterness, sweetness, astringency, saltiness and [...] "sourness". Aging is rare and most <b>teas</b> <b>are</b> consumed {{as fresh as}} possible, with particular note to new harvests.|$|R
50|$|Black <b>tea</b> grading <b>is</b> usually {{based upon}} {{one of four}} scales of quality. Whole-leaf <b>teas</b> <b>are</b> the highest quality, {{followed}} by broken leaves, fannings, and dusts. Whole-leaf <b>teas</b> <b>are</b> produced {{with little or no}} alteration to the tea leaf. This results in a finished product with a coarser texture than that of bagged <b>teas.</b> Whole-leaf <b>teas</b> <b>are</b> widely considered the most valuable, especially if they contain leaf tips. Broken leaves are commonly sold as medium-grade loose teas. Smaller broken varieties may <b>be</b> included in <b>tea</b> bags.|$|R
5|$|A popular snack in Kalimpong is the momo, steamed dumplings {{made up of}} pork, beef or {{vegetable}} cooked in a wrapping of flour and served with watery soup. Wai-Wai is a packaged Nepalese snack made of noodles which are eaten either dry or in soup form. Churpee, a kind of hard cheese made from yak's or chauri's (a hybrid of yak and cattle) milk, is sometimes chewed. A form of noodle called Thukpa, served in soup form is popular in Kalimpong. There are {{a large number of}} restaurants which offer a wide variety of cuisines, ranging from Indian to continental, to cater to the tourists. <b>Tea</b> <b>is</b> the most popular beverage in Kalimpong, procured from the famed Darjeeling tea gardens. Kalimpong has a golf course besides Kalimpong Circuit House.|$|E
5|$|About 190 {{species of}} {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} park have been registered, {{most of which are}} part of the natural composition of the Siberian taiga. Marsh Labrador <b>tea</b> <b>is</b> the most common, the park being one of only three locations in Norway where it occurs. The most common berry plant is lingonberry; common bilberry and bog bilberry are also common, but do not carry good yields of berries. In August there is normally a good yield of cloudberry, and occasionally there can be found Arctic raspberry. There is a limited number of marine plants. The steep cliffs at Revsaksskaret allow mountainous plants to thrive, such as Alpine chickweed, white bluegrass and brittle bladder-fern. These were common throughout the area after the last glacial period, but have vanished with forestation. Other mountainous plants common in the region are not found in Pasvik because of low oxygen levels in the lower soil levels.|$|E
5|$|Homemade {{fruit juices}} {{are also a}} common {{household}} drink during warm days and during Ramadan, the holy month for fasting by Muslims. In the Palestinian culture, coffee and <b>tea</b> <b>is</b> traditionally served to adults during a visit or gathering, while juice is served to everyone. Drinks such as tamar hind or qamar deen are served during special occasions to everyone. Tamar hind, originally from Africa is a liquorice drink made by soaking or infusing liquorice sticks, and adding lemon juice. Qamar deen is traditionally served to break the Ramadan fast (as is water), and is an iced drink made from a dry sheet of apricots soaked in water, and mixed with lemon juice or syrup.|$|E

5|$|Lana {{makes her}} first {{literary}} appearance in Smallville: Strange Visitors, published by Aspect. In Strange Visitors, Lana attempts {{to organize a}} fund raiser for {{the family of a}} school mate, Stewart, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Her effort is rendered moot when Lex Luthor and Dr. Donald Jacobi, a con artist that comes to Smallville, pick up Stewart's medical bills after a meteor rock removes all of the malignant cancer cells in his brain. In Smallville: Dragon, Lana visits an antiques dealer, Mrs. Mayfern, looking for a gift for her boyfriend, Whitney. When she leaves she breaks up with Whitney and starts dating Clark. It is eventually discovered that she was hypnotized by Mrs. Mayfern, whose homegrown herbal <b>tea</b> <b>is</b> fertilized by meteor rocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} trees are widely {{gathered}} as fodder for livestock and some can be eaten by humans but {{they tend to}} be high in tannins which makes them bitter. Leaves of the curry tree (Murraya koenigii) are eaten, those of kaffir lime (Citrus × hystrix) (e.g., Thai food) and Ailanthus (e.g., in Korean dishes such as bugak) and those of the European bay tree (Laurus nobilis) and the California bay tree (Umbellularia californica) are used for flavouring food. Camellia sinensis, the source of <b>tea,</b> <b>is</b> a small tree but seldom reaches its full height, being heavily pruned to make picking the leaves easier.|$|E
5|$|The {{most popular}} local snack food is Momos, a steamed {{dumpling}} containing meat or vegetables cooked in a doughy wrapping {{and served with}} clear soup and achar. Locals love Alu Dom (Spicy steamed potato curry) and various versions of it are served. For example, they add Wai Wai Mimi instant noodles over a bowl of Alu Dom and call it Alu Mimi. Another popular Tibetan food is 'Thukpa', which is a hot noodle soup with meat, eggs and vegetables. Kinema, Chhurpi, Shaphalay,(Tibetan bread stuffed with meat). Fermented foods and beverages are consumed by {{a large percentage of}} the population. Fermented foods include preparations of soybean, bamboo shoots, milk and Sel roti, which is made from rice. Tea (esp. the butter <b>tea)</b> <b>is</b> the most popular delicacy, Alcoholic beverages include Tongba, Jnaard and Chhaang, variations of a local beer made from fermenting finger millet.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} kinds of cooling tea. Different kinds of <b>tea</b> <b>are</b> purported to cure or relieve a variety of diseases. Some <b>teas</b> <b>are</b> {{consumed}} to alleviate sore throats, some for flu, and others {{for a number of}} ailments.|$|R
5000|$|Within these main {{categories}} of <b>tea</b> <b>are</b> vast varieties of individual beverages. Some researchers have counted more than 700 of these beverages. Others {{put the number}} at more than 1,000. Some of the variations are due to different strains of the Camillia plant. The popular Tieguanyin, for example, is traced back to a single plant discovered in Anxi in Fujian province. Other teas draw some of their characteristics from local growing conditions. However, the largest factor in the wide variations comes from differences in tea processing after the <b>tea</b> leaves <b>are</b> harvested. White and green <b>teas</b> <b>are</b> heat-treated (...) soon after picking to prevent oxidization, often called fermentation, caused by natural enzymes in the leaves. Oolong <b>teas</b> <b>are</b> partially oxidized. Black <b>teas</b> <b>are</b> fully oxidized. Other differences come from variations in the processing steps.|$|R
25|$|Originally <b>tea</b> <b>was</b> {{used for}} {{ceremonial}} purposes or {{as part of}} traditional herbal medicine. Some of teas made of fruits, leaves, seeds or roots are enjoyed. Five tastes of <b>tea</b> <b>are</b> distinguished in Korea: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and pungent.|$|R
5|$|Green tea: This tea has {{undergone}} {{the least amount}} of oxidation. The oxidation process is halted by the quick application of heat after tea picking, either with steam, the method preferred in Japan, or by dry roasting and cooking in hot pans, preferred in Chinese tea processing. Tea leaves may be left to dry as separate leaves or they may be rolled into small pellets to make gunpowder tea. This process is time consuming and is typically done with pekoes of higher quality. The <b>tea</b> <b>is</b> processed within one to two days of harvesting, and if done correctly retains most of the chemical composition of the fresh leaves from which it was produced. Variation in steaming time for fixation or processing from additional stages of rolling and drying are sometimes used to improve or altering the flavour for types of green tea. Green tea leaves undergo fixation by either roasting (panning) or steaming. Generally, roasted varieties are richer in flavor, while steamed varieties are more vivid in color.|$|E
5|$|In 2015–2016, {{percentage}} {{share of}} Gross Value Added (GVA) at factor cost by Economic Activity at constant price (base year 2011–2012) was Agriculture-Forestry and Fishery – 14.84%, Industry 18.51% and Services 66.65%. It {{has been observed}} {{that there has been}} a slow but steady decline in the percentage share of industry and agriculture over the years. Agriculture is the leading economic sector in West Bengal. Rice is the state's principal food crop. Rice, potato, jute, sugarcane, and wheat are the top five crops of the state. <b>Tea</b> <b>is</b> produced commercially in northern districts; the region is well known for Darjeeling and other high quality teas. State industries are localised in the Kolkata region, the mineral-rich western highlands, and the Haldia port region. The Durgapur–Asansol colliery belt is home to a number of major steel plants. Important manufacturing industries are engineering products, electronics, electrical equipment, cables, steel, leather, textiles, jewellery, frigates, automobiles, railway coaches, and wagons. The Durgapur centre has established a number of industries in the areas of tea, sugar, chemicals, and fertilisers. Natural resources like tea and jute in and nearby parts has made West Bengal a major centre for the jute and tea industries.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{the hotel}} {{fell into a}} {{turbulent}} period. Terrorist threats from the Irish Republican Army became the chief concern, and bomb scares were not uncommon. The oil crisis in the early 1970s directly affected business and prompted the Bracewell-Smith family to sell their stake to Trafalgar House on 5 April 1976 for £2.75m. At {{the time of the}} sale, the hotel's occupancy rate was just 45 percent; the Ritz Grill Room had been closed and it had lost quite a bit of money in recent times. In 1984, the Ritz brought back its weekly Sunday tea dances which were popular during the 1920s and 1930s. Because of demand, the hotel considered restricting afternoon tea at the Ritz to hotel guests only, as those staying at the Ritz were often unable to get a table. Many Londoners who would have been barred by this restriction voiced disapproval and the Ritz compromised by requiring reservations for afternoon tea at the hotel. Proper attire for <b>tea</b> <b>is</b> a must; the Ritz once refused to admit Mick Jagger for tea because he was not wearing a jacket and tie.|$|E
50|$|Fermented <b>teas</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} sold as compressed tea {{of various}} shapes, including bricks, discs, bowls, or mushrooms. Ripened Pu-erh <b>teas</b> <b>are</b> ripened while loose, then compressed. Fermented <b>teas</b> can <b>be</b> aged {{for many years}} to improve their flavor, again comparable to wines. Raw Pu-erh <b>tea</b> can <b>be</b> aged up to 50 years in some cases without diminishing in quality, and ripened Pu-erh can be aged up to 10 or 15 years. Experts and aficionados disagree about the optimal age.|$|R
30|$|Polyphenolic {{compounds}} {{from green}} <b>tea</b> <b>are</b> antioxidants used in modern dentistry [11, 14]. Green <b>tea,</b> which <b>is</b> {{extracted from the}} plant Camellia sinensis, contains various catechin compounds. Catechins are chemical antioxidants that {{have the ability to}} destroy free radicals. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the most active and abundant catechin present in green <b>tea,</b> which <b>is</b> a water-soluble and a safe material [15]. Moreover, several {{studies have shown that the}} catechins in green <b>tea</b> <b>are</b> rapidly metabolized, which explains its antioxidant property [16].|$|R
5|$|Tea: The <b>tea</b> plant <b>is</b> {{indigenous}} to western Yunnan; {{by the mid}} 2nd millennium BC, <b>tea</b> <b>was</b> being consumed in Yunnan for medicinal purposes. <b>Tea</b> drinking <b>was</b> already an established custom in the daily life in this area {{as shown by the}} Contract with a Slave, written by Wang Bao in 59 BC. This written record also reveals that <b>tea</b> <b>was</b> processed and used as a drink instead of a medicinal herb, emerged no later than the 1st century BC. Early Chinese tea culture began from the time of Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) to the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420–589) when <b>tea</b> <b>was</b> widely used by Chinese gentry, but only took its initial shape during the Tang Dynasty (618–907).|$|R
5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} flushes, which {{includes}} a terminal bud and two young leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early {{spring and early summer}} or late spring. Autumn or winter pickings of tea flushes are much less common, though they occur when climate permits. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality <b>tea</b> <b>is</b> needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a snap of the forearm, arm, or even the shoulders, with the picker grasping the tea shoot using the thumb and forefinger, with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though there will be more broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown that machine plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.|$|E
