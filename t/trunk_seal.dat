50|$|The female {{hornbill}} {{builds a}} {{nest in the}} hollow of a large tree <b>trunk,</b> <b>sealing</b> the opening with a plaster made up mainly of feces. She remains imprisoned there, relying on the male to bring her food, until the chicks are half developed. During this period the female undergoes a complete moult. The young chicks have no feathers and appear very plump. The mother is fed by her mate through a slit in the seal. The clutch consists of one or two eggs, which she incubates for 38-40 days. The female voids feces through the nest slit, as do the chicks from the age of two weeks. Once the female emerges from the nest, the chicks seal it again.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} use, however, is {{probably}} in vehicles. It {{is used in}} door <b>seals,</b> window <b>seals,</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>seals,</b> and sometimes hood seals. Frequently, these seals {{are the source of}} noise due to movement of the door against the car body and the resulting friction between the EPDM rubber and the mating surface (painted sheet metal or glass). This can be alleviated using specialty coatings that are applied at the time of manufacture of the weather seal. Such coatings can also greatly increase the chemical resistance of EPDM rubber. Some vehicle manufacturers also recommend a light application of silicone dielectric grease to weatherstripping to reduce noise. Other uses in vehicles include cooling system circuit hoses where water pumps, thermostats, EGR valves, EGR coolers, heaters, oil coolers, radiators, and degas bottles are connected with EPDM hoses, as well as charge air tubing on turbocharged engines to connect the cold side of the charge air cooler (intercooler) to the intake manifold.|$|R

The much {{published}} grocery slips, {{found at}} the Carmel-by-the-Sea cottage and asserted by the prosecution to be in McPherson's handwriting; mysteriously disappeared from the courtroom in early August. They were last seen being examined by a juror who left the courtroom on a break. Some speculated the juror was sympathetic to McPherson and dropped them down a toilet while in the restroom. [...] The juror was investigated and determined to have no connection with the McPherson party {{and the loss of}} the grocery slips determined an accident. Mildred Kennedy purported assistant DA Ryan might have disposed of them himself. [...] The defense made a serious accusation against the prosecution stating the police photostats of the grocery slips, as supported by several area photographers, did not match the photograph taken of them. Their contention was, the photostats, which were in police custody, were altered to look like the evangelist's handwriting. 4. A big, blue steamer trunk purportedly belonging to Kenneth Ormiston, was confiscated in September from a New York hotel. Its contents were inventoried and the <b>trunk</b> <b>sealed.</b> Upon arrival in Los Angeles, Prosecutor Asa Keyes checked its contents against the inventory list, however, several articles of clothing were missing.|$|R
50|$|When {{woody plants}} {{naturally}} shed branches {{because they are}} nonproductive, usually from lack of light reaching lower branches, these lower branches typically die back to the branch collar. Insects and fungi decompose the dead branch, and it eventually falls off, leaving the exposed branch core {{at the point of}} its attachment at the branch collar. This arrangement helps to resist the spread of decay organisms into the parent branch or trunk during the time it takes for the increment growth of the <b>trunk</b> to <b>seal</b> over the dead branch stub.|$|R
50|$|Tacy Atkinson {{left the}} diary in a <b>sealed</b> <b>trunk</b> {{in her home}} in Turkey {{when she left the}} country in 1917, since the Turkish {{government}} prohibited anything written be sent out of the country. Nine years later, the unopened trunk was sent to her in the United States of America.|$|R
5000|$|Usually in North America, {{cars are}} only sold as [...] "two-door" [...] or [...] "four-door" [...] models. This American-style {{labelling}} only includes the passengers' and driver's doors, and not hatches on hatchbacks and station wagons. This {{has led to}} many not understanding that hatches are counted as doors in Europe, whilst the lids to <b>sealed</b> <b>trunks</b> aren't.|$|R
40|$|Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) rubber {{emerges as}} a {{dominant}} elastomer for major engineering applications. The major properties of EPDM are its outstanding heat, ozone and weather resistance ability. It has a good resistance to polar substances and steam condition too. In automobiles EPDM rubber has a common use as seals. This includes door <b>seals,</b> window <b>seals,</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>seals</b> and sometimes hood seals. Frequently these seals {{are the source of}} noise due to the movement of the door versus the car body. This is due to friction between the EPDM rubber parts and the mating surfaces. Thus, the contact iteration between the rubber sealing and the indenting object must be known to optimize the performance of rubber sealing. However, it is need less to mention that the behaviour of any viscoelastic material is very difficult to be predicted. In the present work various tribo-characteristics of EPDM rubber of different hardness have been evaluated utilizing the available laboratory test facilities in the Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India. Compression tests have been carried out using ‘Instron’ to determine the flow behaviour of EPDM rubber of different hardness both in dry as well as under different conditions of lubrication. The flow behaviour like load -vs. - elongation curves, true stress -vs. - elongation curves and true stress -vs. - true strain curves have been drawn from the experimental data. Abrasive wear behaviour has been evaluated using a two-body abrasion tester and the pattern abrasion has been appraised through SEM/EDAX study. Experimental results reveal that the hardness of EPDM rubber has significant effect on the flow behaviour and wear characteristics. The hardness, again, depends on the proportion of carbon black (CB) content. Thus it can be stated that the flow behaviour can be governed by controlling the CB concentration in the EPDM rubber. Based on the experimental results conclusion has been drawn accordingly. Some of the important tribo-characteristics of EPDM have been highlighted. Light has also been shed on various possible areas of further researches those should be undertaken in the future to come...|$|R

He realises that there is a connection between Ralston and the South African apartheid government. Avoiding an attempt by the scarred Frenchman, Poidatz, to kill him, he breaks open Ralston's <b>sealed</b> <b>trunk</b> in the British embassy in Rome. He expects to find blueprints of a missile Ralston is illegally supplying to South Africa; instead, he finds the King, drugged and unconscious.|$|R
5000|$|A compact sedan may be {{a better}} choice than a subcompact owing to better load {{capacity}} and more room for battery placement. Some commercial EV Conversions use vehicles in this size range. One example is a 1992 Honda Civic. [...] In this conversion, the back seat was retained, and there is still enough room to sink nine flooded lead-acid batteries low in the trunk where the spare tire was located, as well as another nine batteries under the hood. Another example is a 1987 Mitsubishi Tredia where the rear batteries have been raised above the <b>trunk</b> floorspace, <b>sealed,</b> and externally vented. With suspension modifications, increasing shock length & spring rating, the car must still be below GVWR, even with the driver and passengers. Exceeding the total design weight of the vehicle would be illegal in some states, and might result in cancellation by an insurance company.|$|R
60|$|Apparently the King thought himself safe now, and {{actually}} {{did not take}} the trouble to see whether his compromising letters were in the <b>sealed</b> <b>trunks</b> or not! At least, if he did know that they were absent, and that Perez could produce proof of his guilt, {{it is hard to see}} why, with endless doubts and hesitations, he allowed the secret process for murder against Perez to drag on, after a long interruption, into 1590. Vasquez examined and re-examined Perez, but there was still only one witness against him, the scoundrel Enriquez. One was not enough.|$|R
40|$|With the {{increased}} adoption of thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) in automotive weather seat systems. the foams of TPVs present an important milestone in providing key {{applications such as}} <b>trunk</b> and door <b>seals.</b> In this study, microcellular foams of TPV based on waste ground rubber tire powder (WGRT) were investigated. In order to investigate the relationship between processing conditions and structure of TPV foams, we first prepared the thermoplastic vulcanizates of PP-g-MA/WGRT, then the samples were saturated with carbon dioxide and the saturated specimens were expanded during the pressure-quench process. The {{results indicated that the}} microcellular structure was dependent on the processing conditions. Cell size increased with saturation temperature, whereas cell density and relative density decreased. Different nucleation processes were produced with saturation pressure.

5000|$|Other {{species have}} evolved {{internal}} inflatable air spaces {{connected to the}} vocal tract, which {{play a role in}} vocal tract resonance. The male Mongolian gazelle and musk ox possess an air space (paired and two-chambered in the former) attached to the larynx, while bears have such spaces connected to the pharynx. Male howler monkeys have an unpaired rostroventral laryngeal air sac within the hyoid bulla (extension of the hyoid bone) and a pair of ventral laryngeal air spaces outside. The hammer-headed bat has a pouch in the palatine that connects to an enlarged nasopharynx region, in addition to paired cheek pouches which extend to the rostrum. Elephants possess a pharyngeal pouch associated with their larynx and hyoid apparatus, and their roars can also be modified by the nostrils in their <b>trunks.</b> Male elephant <b>seals</b> and saiga antelopes have an enlarged and inflated proboscis, which also affects resonance. Saiga nevertheless roar with their mouths closed and produce a [...] "nasal roar".|$|R
6000|$|Upon which, {{they sent}} poor Dorn with the <b>sealed</b> <b>trunk</b> in CORPORE, {{to have it}} opened by Voltaire himself. Collini, in THE BILLY-GOAT, next morning (July 7th)) says, he (Collini) had just loaded two journey-pistols, part of the usual carriage-furniture, and they lay on the table. At sight of poor Dorn darkening his chamber-door, Voltaire, the prey of various flurries and high-flown vehemences, {{snatched}} one of the pistols ("pistol without powder, without flint, without lock," [...] says Voltaire; [...] "efficient pistol just loaded", testifies Collini);--snatched said pistol; and clicking it to the cock, plunged Dorn-ward, with furious exclamations: not quite unlikely to have shot Dorn (in the fleshy parts),--had not Collini hurriedly struck up his hand, [...] "MON DIEU, MONSIEUR!" [...] and Dorn, with trunk, instantly vanished. Dorn, naturally, ran to a Lawyer. Voltaire, dreading Trial for intended Homicide, instantly gathered himself; and shot away, self and Pucelle with Collini, clear off;--leaving Niece Denis, leaving moneys and other things, to wait till to-morrow, and settle as they could.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} how the emission of isoprenoids that follows wounding of pine needles is restrained and how this can be associated to wound sealing processes and to defense mechanisms against pathogenic attacks. Needles of two Mediterranean pines (Pinus pined and Pinus halepensis) emitted a high amount of monoterpenes immediately after wounding but the emission became undetectable within 24 h. Histochemical analysis revealed that the purple stain coloring the isoprenoids in fresh needle sections turned black 24 h after wounding the needles. This suggests that isoprenoids accumulated at the wounding sites. Sections below the wounds showed that the ducts were still full of isoprenoids stained in purple. This excluded {{the possibility that the}} emission from wounded needles ceases because the ducts were empty. Chromatographic analysis of the resin covering the wounds indicated a high amount of sesquiterpenes 1 h after wounding and a considerable increase in oxygenated isoprenoids 24 h after wounding. Our results indicate that the emission from wounded needles may be rapidly limited and eventually stopped by the accumulation of oxidation products of the same emitted isoprenoids. This mechanism is similar to that used to <b>seal</b> <b>trunk</b> wounding and may constitute a physical and chemical barrier against pest attacks...|$|R
60|$|Perez {{offered to}} stand his trial, knowing that {{evidence}} against him could not be found. His accomplices were far away; he would be acquitted, as Bothwell was acquitted of Darnley's death. Philip could not face the situation. He bade Perez consult the President of the Council, De Pazos, a Bishop, and tell him all, while De Pazos should mollify young Escovedo. The Bishop, a casuist, actually assured young Escovedo that Perez and the Princess 'are as innocent as myself.' The Bishop {{did not agree with}} the Inquisition: he could say that Perez was innocent, because he only obeyed the King's murderous orders. Young Escovedo retreated: Vasquez persevered, and the Princess d'Eboli, writing to the King, called Vasquez 'a Moorish dog.' Philip had both Perez and the Princess arrested, for Vasquez was not to be put down; his business in connection with the litigations was to pursue the Princess, and Philip could not tell Vasquez that he was on the wrong trail. The lady was sent to her estates; this satisfied Vasquez, and Perez and he were bound over to keep the peace. But suspicion hung about Perez, and Philip preferred that it should be so. The secretary was accused of peculation, he had taken bribes on all hands, and he was sentenced to heavy fines and imprisonment (January 1585). Now Enriquez confessed, and a kind of secret inquiry, of which the records survive, dragged its slow course along. Perez was under arrest, in a house near a church. He dropped out of a window and rushed into the church, the civil power burst open the gates, violated sanctuary, and found our friend crouching, all draped with festoons of cobwebs, in the timber work under the roof. The Church censured the magistrates, but they had got Perez, and Philip defied the ecclesiastical courts. Perez, a prisoner, tried to escape by the aid of one of Escovedo's murderers, who was staunch, but failed, while his wife was ill treated to make him give up all the compromising letters of the King. He did give up two <b>sealed</b> <b>trunks</b> full of papers. But his ally and steward, Martinez, had first (it is said) selected and secreted the royal notes which proved the guilt of Philip.|$|R
