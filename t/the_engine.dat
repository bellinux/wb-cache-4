5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Boeing {{selected}} the CFM56-3 to exclusively power the Boeing 737-300 variant. The 737 wings were {{closer to the}} ground than previous applications for the CFM56, necessitating several modifications to <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> The fan diameter was reduced, which reduced the bypass ratio, and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> accessory gearbox was moved {{from the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> (the 6o'clock position) to the 9o'clock position, giving <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> nacelle its distinctive flat-bottomed shape. The overall thrust was also reduced, from , mostly due to the reduction in bypass ratio.|$|E
5|$|The Department of Civil Aviation {{performed}} {{tests on}} {{parts of the}} DC-4 fuel system. Tests on <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> fuel system showed that when <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> boost pump was operating, a vortex formed in <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> fuel tank. If {{a small amount of}} water was present, this vortex held the water in suspension and prevented it from entering <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> The tests also showed that when the boost pump was turned off, the vortex dissipated and any water would soon find its way into <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> Investigators believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> boost pumps would be turned off.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> used {{a single}} updraft carburetor; early {{versions}} used a Stromberg unit, which {{was replaced by}} a Schebler unit. The carburetor was {{on the right side of}} <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> the mixture went into a passage through <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> block to the intake manifold on the left side of <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> Ignition was by Delco coil and breaker points, with the distributor at the end of the generator/starter unit.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> bear {{a passing}} {{resemblance}} to <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> on <b>the</b> Snowdon Mountain Railway, Christopher Awdry {{notes that he}} doesn't believe his father intended any of <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> to correspond with particular SMR locomotives.|$|R

50|$|Remnants of {{the aerial}} tramway (flying fox) {{foundations}} are located outside the fenced enclosure around <b>the</b> <b>engines.</b> Part of <b>the</b> tram track {{is visible in}} front of the flying fox foundations. The tracks run north-south along the river bank and finish near <b>the</b> <b>engines.</b> <b>The</b> chimney stands slightly northwest of <b>the</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
5|$|A new {{tricycle}} undercarriage was fitted, {{with the main}} gear units retracting into <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> nacelles.|$|E
5|$|After version 1.0 {{had been}} finished, the engine's code name White Engine {{was changed to}} the {{official}} title Crystal Tools. This was not only done to represent {{the company and its}} works better, but also due to the refractive effects of real-life crystals that were meant to symbolize the flexibility of <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> Over the next few months, the programmers advanced <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> to version 1.1 and added preliminary support for the Wii. In September 2011, Final Fantasy Versus XIII director Tetsuya Nomura announced that his team had replaced Crystal Tools with a proprietary action game engine that was supplemented by the lighting technology of the company's new Luminous Studio engine. Other teams, such as the staff behind Final Fantasy XIII-2, kept using and refining Crystal Tools. For , <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> was adjusted to make it more suitable to games with an open world design.|$|E

5|$|Another {{effort to}} raise Monitors {{propeller}} was successful on 8 June 1998, although {{the amount of}} effort required {{to work in the}} difficult conditions off Cape Hatteras was underestimated and the fewer than 30 divers used were nearly overwhelmed. The 1999 dive season was mostly research oriented as divers investigated the wreck in detail, planning how to recover <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and determining if they could stabilize the hull so that it would not collapse onto the turret. In 2000 the divers shored up the port side of the hull with bags of grout, installed <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> recovery system, an external framework to which <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> would be attached, in preparation for the next season, and made over five times as many dives as they had the previous season.|$|E
5|$|By 2012 {{the latest}} version had seen many {{improvements}} to the design, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and the overall driving experience. It now had 517 PS and 620 Nm of torque from <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and came with carbon ceramic brakes as standard.|$|E
5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{uses the}} SCUMM engine {{developed}} for Maniac Mansion. LucasArts had gradually modified <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> since its creation. For example, {{the number of}} input verbs was reduced and items in the character's inventory are represented by icons rather than text. While implementing an animation, the designers encountered a problem later discovered to be limitation of <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> Upon learning of the limitation, Gilbert reminisced about the file size of the first game. The staff then resolved to include it in the sequel.|$|E

A replacement for <b>the</b> M-series inline-6 <b>engines,</b> <b>the</b> JZ <b>engines</b> were 24-valve DOHC <b>engines.</b> <b>The</b> JZ <b>engine</b> was offered in 2.5- and 3.0-litre versions.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> B-series <b>engines,</b> {{which are}} still <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> with <b>the</b> highest {{production}} volume today, were developed and introduced in <b>the</b> 1990s. <b>Engines</b> with vertical crankshaft followed shortly later.|$|R
5|$|Early {{versions}} of the Su-25 were equipped with two R95Sh non-afterburning turbojets, in compartments {{on either side of}} the rear fuselage. The engines, sub-assemblies and surrounding fuselage are cooled by air provided by the cold air intakes on top of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> nacelles. A drainage system collects oil, hydraulic fluid residues and fuel from the engines after flight or after an unsuccessful start. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> control systems allows independent operation of each engine. The latest versions (Su-25T and TM) are equipped with improved R-195 engines.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann {{said the}} German pilots {{themselves}} still learned from their enemy. Oil freezing in the DB 605 engines of the Bf109G-6s made them difficult {{to start in}} the extreme cold of the Russian winter. A captured Soviet airman showed them how pouring fuel into the aircraft's oil sump would thaw the oil and enable <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> to start on the first try. Another solution, also learned from the Soviets, was to ignite fuel under <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Garuda Indonesia Flight 421 had {{to ditch}} {{in a river}} because of hail-induced engine flameouts, killing a flight {{attendant}} and injuring dozens of passengers. Prior to this accident, there were several other incidents of single or dual flameouts due to these weather conditions. After three incidents through 1998, CFMI made modifications to <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> to improve {{the way in which}} <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> handled hail ingestion. The major changes included a modification to the fan/booster splitter (making it more difficult for hail to be ingested by the core of <b>the</b> <b>engine)</b> and the use of an elliptical, rather than conical, spinner at the intake. These changes did not prevent the 2002 accident, and the investigation board found that the pilots did not follow the proper procedures for attempting to restart <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> which contributed to the final result. Recommendations were made to better educate pilots on how to handle these conditions, as well as to revisit FAA rain and hail testing procedures. No further engine modifications were recommended.|$|E
50|$|Investigators {{then thought}} that the crew may have mishandled <b>the</b> right <b>engine</b> after <b>the</b> left <b>engine</b> flamed out. There were no indications, however, that the crew mishandled <b>the</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Reaction <b>Engines</b> Scimitar is a {{derivative}} of <b>the</b> SABRE <b>engine</b> technology, but intended for jet airliners (<b>the</b> Reaction <b>Engines</b> A2 concept), rather than space launch applications. Consequently, most of <b>the</b> Scimitar <b>engine</b> technology {{is similar to}} Sabre but designed for much longer life. Both engines are designed around existing gas turbine, and ramjet technology, but <b>the</b> Scimitar <b>engine</b> lacks <b>the</b> rocket features and has high bypass features for greater efficiency. <b>The</b> <b>engines</b> burn liquid hydrogen as fuel.|$|R

5|$|In April 1951 Justice Simpson {{advised the}} Minister for Civil Aviation that new {{evidence}} had become available. The Minister gave permission for the Inquiry to be re-opened. The Inquiry re-opened in Melbourne on 4 June 1951. The Department of Civil Aviation had recently completed {{tests on the}} DC-4 fuel system. The tests showed that when an engine boost pump was operating, a vortex in <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> fuel tank prevented water from entering <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> The tests also showed that when the boost pump was turned off, any water would soon {{find its way into}} <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> The Department of Civil Aviation believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> boost pumps would be turned off. However, Justice Simpson stated that the re-opened Inquiry served only to confirm his view that the Amana's loss of power was not due to water in the fuel.|$|E
5|$|In October 1990, while {{flying a}} {{training}} route in eastern Colorado, B-1B (s/n 86-0128) from the 384th Bomb Wing, 28th Bomb Squadron, McConnell AFB, experienced an explosion as the engines reached full power without afterburners. Fire on the aircraft's left was spotted. The #1 engine {{was shut down}} and its fire extinguisher was activated. The accident investigation determined that <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> had suffered catastrophic failure, engine blades had cut through <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> mounts and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> became detached from the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In a competition, using <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> {{ends the}} soaring flight. Unpowered gliders are lighter and, {{as they do}} not need a safety margin for {{starting}} <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> they can safely thermal at lower altitudes in weaker conditions. Consequently, pilots in unpowered gliders may complete competition flights when some powered competitors cannot. Conversely, motor glider pilots can start <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> if conditions will no longer support soaring flight, while unpowered gliders will have to land out, away from the home airfield, requiring retrieval by road using the glider's trailer.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>engines</b> {{were later}} marketed as the CD-135 by Continental <b>Engines.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engines</b> {{produced}} in St. Egidien, Germany were granted final assembly in Fairhope, Alabama for the U.S. retrofit market in 2015.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>engines</b> were {{connected}} to a common gearbox that was mounted in the nose. <b>The</b> rear <b>engine</b> {{was connected to the}} nose-mounted gearbox by a long drive shaft similar to the American Bell P-39 Airacobra. The gearbox did not combine the power output of <b>the</b> two <b>engines.</b> Instead, <b>the</b> rear <b>engine</b> drove <b>the</b> forward controllable-pitch propeller, while <b>the</b> front <b>engine</b> independently drove <b>the</b> rearward fixed-pitch propeller.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>engines</b> were {{featured}} in both Titanic films, [...] "A Night To Remember" [...] (1958) and the made-for-TV film [...] "S.O.S. Titanic" [...] (1979). <b>The</b> <b>engines</b> {{are very similar}} to <b>the</b> actual <b>engines</b> on board <b>the</b> Titanic albeit <b>the</b> Titanic's <b>engines</b> were 4 cylinders as opposed to three. Yet <b>the</b> Kempton <b>engines</b> are <b>the</b> correct size (4 stories tall) and of the correct type (triple expansion). Alas, land based pumping engines, Like Kempton Park's engines have flywheels: Marine Steam Engines have no flywheels.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the cemetery's operation, the {{locomotives}} hauling the funeral trains from Waterloo would not travel down the branch into the cemetery, as it would leave <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> at the wrong end of the train for the return journey. Instead, the train would stop immediately after passing Necropolis Junction, and the carriages would be uncoupled from <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> A team of black horses would then haul the carriages down the sloping branch line to the two cemetery stations. While the train was on the branch line <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> would be repositioned so as to be at the front of the train once the horses drew it back out of the branch and onto the main line.|$|E

50|$|The scenery outside quickly {{becomes a}} blur {{as the train}} travels faster and faster. Casey adds more coal to <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> furnace, and, when running out, also uses up his coal shovel and rocking chair, until the ribbing on <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> boiler {{exterior}} is forced off. Casey grabs and fits <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> funnel back on, before it falls off, when the train speeds down one hill, it heads past a 7 mile sign, and burns it and the tracks. As <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> cowcatcher nearly snaps off, Casey pulls it back on, before <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> boiler gets so hot that the parts fall off, and while Casey manages to fix it time, he bravely gives his engine some running repairs while the train is seen roaring down a hill.|$|R
50|$|During {{conventional}} flight, <b>the</b> lift <b>engines</b> {{would be}} inactive; shortly prior to entering vertical flight, compressed air provided by <b>the</b> single cruise <b>engine</b> {{would be used}} to accelerate the startup of <b>the</b> lift <b>engines.</b> Considerable attention was paid during development to the design of the air intake for <b>the</b> <b>engines,</b> while involved a set of 7 variable hinged grills which open in a forward-facing position to increase airflow to the lift engines; flow into <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> had to be relatively consistent and stable to avoid issues such as engine surges and vibration. Initially, the series of scuttles were fitted to the exit nozzles of <b>the</b> lift <b>engines</b> to maintain a low-pressure environment beneath <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> and ensure that that the turbine blades rotated in the correct direction; due to the effectiveness of <b>the</b> intake and <b>engine</b> refinements, <b>the</b> scuttles became unnecessary.|$|R
5000|$|Ventura County uses {{two main}} types of <b>engines.</b> <b>The</b> first is <b>the</b> {{standard}} <b>engine,</b> {{which is often}} referred to as a [...] "triple-combination pumper" [...] as it has a fire pump, water tank and fire hose.
