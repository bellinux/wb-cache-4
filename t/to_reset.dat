Founded by Jeff Seibert and Wayne Chang, Crashlytics had rapidly gained popularity {{as a tool to}} help mobile developers identify and fix bugs in their apps. Twitter committed to continue supporting and expanding the service.|$|E
5|$|Cage and Vrataski {{infiltrate}} the MoD Main Building {{to obtain a}} prototype built by Carter that can locate the Omega. Cage finally compels General Brigham {{to give him the}} device. During the ensuing car chase, Cage discovers the Omega is under the Louvre Pyramid in Paris. However, Cage is captured and seriously injured. He wakes up in a hospital to find he has been given a transfusion and thus has lost the ability <b>to</b> <b>reset</b> the day.|$|E
5|$|Fox {{ran with}} an unusual gait, as he was {{required}} to hop-step on his good leg due to the extra time the springs in his artificial leg required <b>to</b> <b>reset</b> after each step. He found the training painful as the additional pressure he had to place on both his good leg and his stump led to bone bruises, blisters and intense pain. Fox found that after about 20minutes of each run, he crossed a pain threshold and the run became easier.|$|E

5|$|In 1940 Johnson had an {{operation}} <b>to</b> <b>reset</b> his collarbone, and began flying regularly. He {{took part in}} the offensive sweeps over German-occupied Europe from 1941 to 1944, almost without rest. Johnson was involved in heavy aerial fighting during this period. His combat tour included participation in the Dieppe Raid, Combined Bomber Offensive, Battle of Normandy, Operation Market Garden,the Battle of the Bulge and the Western Allied invasion of Germany. Johnson progressed to the rank of group captain {{by the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|On 19 February 2007, a free {{downloadable}} pack {{was made}} available for the game. The pack includes four new playable male agents, three of whom have unique, upgradable headgear. A free update was released on 11 May 2007, which allows the player <b>to</b> <b>reset</b> gangs, {{makes it easier to}} find orbs, improves stunt ring visibility, enhances targeting and camera angles when driving, and provides several other minor fixes. This update also includes a new ground strike attack.|$|E
5|$|On July 19, 2017, Update 6.66 was {{released}} for Dooms multiplayer. Update 6.66 features a revised progression system, all 3 DLC bundled {{into the core}} game, a new 'rune' system (replacing the Hack Module system) and enhanced kill notifications. Update 6.66 required everyone <b>to</b> <b>reset</b> their level and gave players the option to retain all unlocked items or reset them. Players who played before Update 6.66 and players who obtained the 'Slayer' level received unique medals to show their status.|$|E

40|$|Noise in photodiode-type CMOS {{active pixel}} sensors (APS) is {{primarily}} due <b>to</b> the <b>reset</b> (kTC) noise at the sense node, {{since it is}} difficult to implement in-pixel correlated double sampling for a 2 -D array. Signal integrated on the photodiode sense node (SENSE) is calculated by measuring difference between the voltage on the column bus (COL) - before and after the reset (RST) is pulsed. Lower than kTC noise can be achieved with photodiode-type pixels by employing "softreset" technique. Soft-reset refers <b>to</b> <b>resetting</b> with both drain and gate of the n-channel reset transistor kept at the same potential, causing the sense node <b>to</b> be <b>reset</b> using sub-threshold MOSFET current. However, lowering of noise is achieved only at the expense higher image lag and low-light-level non-linearity. In this paper, we present an analysis to explain the noise behavior, show evidence of degraded performance under low-light levels, and describe new pixels that eliminate non-linearity and lag without compromising noise...|$|R
5|$|By 1826, {{economic}} prosperity {{was beginning to}} return to the state. The Old Court party augmented their majority in the House and gained a majority in the Senate. One legislator's proposition to resolve the controversy was to call for the resignation of the governor and lieutenant governor, the entire General Assembly, as well as the justices from both the Old and New Courts, essentially allowing the state <b>to</b> <b>reset</b> its entire government. This extreme measure was rejected. Instead, on December 29, 1826, the General Assembly repealed the reorganization act, and overrode Governor Desha's veto of the measure. They also repealed the replevin law that had touched off the controversy. On January 1, 1827, Francis Blair returned the court records in his possession to the Old Court.|$|E
5|$|The ATA Secure Erase {{command is}} {{designed}} to remove all user data from a drive. With an SSD without integrated encryption, this command will put the drive back to its original out-of-box state. This will initially restore its performance to the highest possible level and the best (lowest number) possible write amplification, {{but as soon as}} the drive starts garbage collecting again the performance and write amplification will start returning to the former levels. Many tools use the ATA Secure Erase command <b>to</b> <b>reset</b> the drive and provide a user interface as well. One free tool that is commonly referenced in the industry is called HDDErase. Gparted and Ubuntu live CDs provide a bootable Linux system of disk utilities including secure erase.|$|E
5|$|While it {{contains}} some small role-playing elements, Dawn of Mana diverges from the prior two-dimensional action role-playing game titles {{of the series}} to focus directly on action-adventure gameplay in a full 3D world. Incorporating the Havok physics engine, the gameplay focuses on the player grabbing and throwing objects and monsters in order to startle enemies before attacking them with a sword and magic. Keldric grows more powerful as the player journeys through an area, only <b>to</b> <b>reset</b> to his base abilities with each new zone unless difficult extra challenges are met. Unlike many of its predecessors, the game does not feature any cooperative multiplayer component.|$|E

5|$|A second prototype, {{completed}} {{near the}} end of 1978, had only about eight rooms, a single dragon, and two objects, and Robinett recognized that the game, though demonstrating what he had set out to do, was boring. He put the game aside for a few months and came back with additional ideas to improve the game, finishing it by June 1979. Two changes that Robinett added were the possibility of being eaten by the dragon, as well as the means <b>to</b> <b>reset</b> the avatar if this should happen, and the addition of the sword object, which could kill the dragon. Robinett found the various possibilities that arose from this combination of elements improved the excitement of the game, and subsequently made three dragons, reusing the same code for the behavior of all three. The magnet was created to work around a potential situation where the player could drop an object into a wall space and make it irretrievable.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Eddie {{continues}} to persuade his superiors {{to form a}} task force to hunt down the Flash, expressing his zero tolerance for vigilantes. When an enraged and jealous Barry, as Flash, makes an attempt on Eddie, Oliver tries to stop Barry, and the two engage in a fight. Oliver manages to wrangle Barry long enough for Harrison Wells and Joe to use colored strobe light <b>to</b> <b>reset</b> Barry's emotional state. Afterward, Barry and Oliver capture Bivolo and place him in the prison at S.T.A.R. Labs. Due to the incident, Eddie gets the grounds to form a police task force to arrest the Flash. Barry confirms Oliver's belief that the former has a lot to learn. Oliver advises him to stay away from Iris West, with whom Barry is in love, because men with secret identities never get the girl. Oliver asks Team Flash to keep his alter ego a secret. A new metahuman able to manipulate fire appears in Central City.|$|E
5|$|Over time, Vrataski trains Cage {{to excel}} in combat training. Frustrated by his {{continued}} failures to excel, he retreats to London to spare his own life, but discovers that the Mimics will attack there after defeating the UDF in France. Eventually receiving {{a vision of a}} dam in Germany, indicating that the Omega is hiding there, Cage and Vrataski spend many loops figuring out how to escape the invasion and reach the dam. Cage comes to know Vrataski and falls in love with her, but Vrataski, who lost a loved one to the Mimics, is only interested in the mission. Upon reaching a point where she is killed whatever they do, Cage decides to fly to the dam on his own. Inside the dam, he is ambushed by an Alpha and Mimic struggling to bleed him out and strip off his ability <b>to</b> <b>reset</b> time. Before they can slowly bleed him to death, Cage deliberately drowns himself to avoid the process.|$|E

5|$|The Odyssey {{consists}} of a black, white, and brown oblong box connected by wires to two rectangular controllers. The primary console box connects to the television set through an included switchbox, which allows the player to switch the television input between the Odyssey and the regular television input cable, and presents itself like a television channel. The controllers, which are designed {{to sit on a}} flat surface, contain one button marked Reset {{on the top of the}} controller and three knobs: one on the right side of the controller, and two on the left with one extending from the other. The reset button does not reset the game, but instead is used by different games <b>to</b> <b>reset</b> individual elements, such as making a player's dot visible after it is turned off during a game. The system can be powered by six C batteries, which were included. An optional AC power supply was sold separately. The Odyssey lacks sound capability and can only display monochrome white shapes on a blank black screen.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{features}} various Bonus Challenges. When Cooper collects five Rare books (there are 100 Rare books in total) during his adventure in Ghoulhaven Hall, a Bonus Challenge is unlocked. The main {{objective of the}} Bonus challenges is to revisit {{one of the rooms}} and perform a different task within it, such as defeating a number of enemies in a certain amount or time or surviving a duel with the Grim Reaper. Upon completing a Bonus Challenge, the player is awarded with a bronze, silver, gold or platinum medal based on their performance. For every platinum medal earned, a piece of the game's concept art is unlocked. If the player collects all 100 Rare books and earns gold or better on all 20 challenges, the player is given the option <b>to</b> <b>reset</b> the game with Amber unlocked as the new playable character in a 21st bonus challenge. Here Amber has 10 health in every level and there are no power ups. When the game is beaten this way the old E3 trailer for the game as well as a deleted cutscene are unlocked to view.|$|E
5|$|When he proves {{unable to}} defeat Data-Sora himself, Pete infects Data-Riku's code with bugs and forces him to fight, putting the datascape {{in danger of}} being totally corrupted. Seeing no alternative, Data-Sora chooses to debug Data-Riku from inside, an act which will cause the datascape <b>to</b> <b>reset</b> if he succeeds, wiping his memories. The {{debugging}} process also activates the bug responsible for the data's corruption, which takes the form of Sora's Heartless. Data-Sora destroys the bug while Mickey and the others are returned to their world by Data-Riku before the reset occurs. In a scene exclusive to HD 2.5 ReMix, after Maleficent and Pete take their leave, Maleficent speaks with Pete about the Book of Prophecies, an ancient artifact capable of transcribing events that have yet to take place and even conjuring them, including entire worlds; she resolves to find it, believing it may hold a connection with the datascape and the journal.|$|E
40|$|Stochastic {{dynamics}} with random <b>resetting</b> leads <b>to</b> a non-equilibrium steady state.

5|$|Although Desha and {{his entire}} {{administration}} campaigned {{on behalf of}} New Court candidates during the legislative elections of 1825, Old Court supporters regained the state House and evenly split the Senate between Old and New Court supporters. Desha's message to the newly reconstituted General Assembly remained critical of banks and the judiciary, but urged legislators to seek a compromise to resolve the court question. Stickles records that Desha was sincere in his desire for a compromise, albeit one that would save face for the New Court Party. He promised that, if the legislature would again authorize appointment of {{a new set of}} judges, he would appoint them equally from both parties. Another plan would have expanded the court to six judges, with three appointed from each party. One legislator proposed that all members of both courts resign, along with Desha, lieutenant governor Robert B. McAfee, and all the legislators in the General Assembly, essentially allowing the state government <b>to</b> <b>reset</b> itself. This bill passed the House but was killed in the Senate. The House passed a measure to restore the Old Court, but the Senate deadlocked on the measure and McAfee, the presiding officer in the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote to defeat it.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) shows Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) a photo taken {{moments before}} Teddy's death, {{showing that the}} balloon moved {{horizontally}} against the wind. Chuck Burks (Bill Dow), a digital photo expert, uses software to uncover evidence of electromagnetic disturbances {{in the shape of}} a child, holding the balloon. During a visit by the agents, the Holveys adamantly dispute Mulder's theory that Teddy was led onto the tracks. Scully sees Golda (Lilyan Chauvin), Maggie's elderly Romanian mother, drawing a swastika on Charlie’s hand. Scully hypothesizes that the Holvey children may be victims of Munchausen by proxy, perpetrated by their grandmother. At a meeting with Steve Holvey, he explains that Golda was against his marriage to Maggie, and that strange things began to happen when Teddy was born and Golda came to live with the family. Steve hints that Golda might be hurting Charlie, leading Scully to suggest that they visit a social worker named Karen Kosseff (Christine Willes). When preparing to leave for a session with Kosseff, Steve and Charlie get in the car but the garage sliding door seems to be malfunctioning, making Steve to step out and take a double-sided ladder <b>to</b> <b>reset</b> the sliding door's motor but in doing so, his tie is caught in the door rails with the motor suddenly starting, strangling and hanging him.

5|$|Turvey's team {{asked him}} <b>to</b> <b>reset</b> his vehicle {{and a yellow}} flag was shown to warn drivers about his {{stranded}} car. After three laps, however, {{he was unable to}} restart his vehicle and retired, causing the safety car to be sent onto the track for the second time. With the field closed up, di Grassi and d'Ambrosio opted to make the mandatory switch into their second cars on the 18th lap. Although the switch would allow di Grassi and d'Ambrosio to gain positions when other drivers made their stops, it required them to conserve electrical energy towards the race's conclusion. The race restarted when the safety car drove into the pit lane on the following lap with López remaining in first place, followed by Heidfeld, Vergne, Bird and Buemi. López built a small lead over {{the rest of the field}} and attention switched to Heidfeld who came under pressure from Vergne, Bird, Buemi and Rosenqvist. Although he had enough electrical energy to do another lap, Vergne became the first of the leading drivers to make a pit stop to switch into his second car at the end of lap 24 in an effort to drive in clean air and undercut the field. The rest of the field followed in response one lap later. Swift work from López's team allowed him to remain narrowly ahead of Vergne, who in turn, moved in front of Heidfeld. The Mahindra driver lost seven positions while Buemi moved from fifth to tenth, both as a result of slow pit stops. Prost led the field for one lap before making his stop on lap 26.|$|E
