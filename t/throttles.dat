5|$|Haynes asked Fitch {{to observe}} the ailerons through the {{passenger}} cabin windows to see if control inputs were having any effect. Fitch reported back that the ailerons were not moving at all. Nonetheless, the crew continued to manipulate their control columns {{for the remainder of}} the flight, hoping for at least some effect. Haynes then asked Fitch to take over control of the <b>throttles</b> so that Haynes could concentrate on his control column. With one throttle in each hand, Fitch was able to mitigate the phugoid cycle and make rough steering adjustments.|$|E
5|$|On 16 December 1982, B-52G 57-6482, {{assigned}} to 328th BS, 93rd BW, Castle AFB, California, was {{participating in a}} Minimum Interval Take-Off (MITO; 12 seconds between each aircraft on takeoff) from Mather AFB, CA. The incident aircraft was in the number two position of a three-ship group. The B-52G was equipped with water injection to give additional thrust for take-off, but the lead aircraft was not equipped with this system. After takeoff the aircraft began to rapidly overtake the lead, so the pilot retarded the <b>throttles</b> rapidly, causing flameout of four engines. The aircraft then stalled and crashed. Nine crew members were killed.|$|E
5|$|On 7 October 1964, Vulcan B.2 XM601 crashed during {{overshoot}} from an asymmetric power practice approach at Coningsby. The copilot had executed the asymmetric {{power approach}} with two engines producing thrust and two at idle. He was being checked by the Squadron Commander, who was {{unfamiliar with the}} aircraft. When he commenced the overshoot the copilot moved all the <b>throttles</b> to full power. The engines that had been producing power reached full power more quickly than the engines at idle and the resultant asymmetric thrust exceeded the available rudder authority, causing the aircraft to spin and crash. All the crew perished.|$|E
5000|$|On many cars, the {{accelerator}} pedal motion is communicated via the <b>throttle</b> cable, {{to activate the}} <b>throttle</b> linkages, which move the <b>throttle</b> plate. In cars with electronic <b>throttle</b> control (also known as [...] "drive-by-wire"), an electric motor controls the <b>throttle</b> linkages and {{the accelerator}} pedal connects not to the <b>throttle</b> body, but to a sensor, which sends the pedal position to the Engine Control Unit (ECU). The ECU determines the <b>throttle</b> opening based on accelerator pedal position and inputs from other engine sensors.|$|R
50|$|As the <b>throttle</b> {{is opened}} up {{slightly}} from the fully closed position, the <b>throttle</b> plate uncovers additional fuel delivery holes behind the <b>throttle</b> plate {{where there is a}} low pressure area created by the <b>throttle</b> plate/Valve blocking air flow; these allow more fuel to flow as well as compensating for the reduced vacuum that occurs when the <b>throttle</b> is opened, thus smoothing the transition to metering fuel flow through the regular open <b>throttle</b> circuit.|$|R
50|$|Usually, the <b>throttle</b> valve is {{controlled}} with a <b>throttle</b> pedal or lever via a direct mechanical linkage. In vehicles with electronic <b>throttle</b> control, the manual <b>throttle</b> control sends {{a signal to}} the Engine Control Unit (ECU), which then directly controls the position of the <b>throttle</b> valve. This means that the operator does not have direct control over the <b>throttle</b> valve; the ECU can finely control the valve in order to reduce emissions or maximize performance.|$|R
5|$|The F-22 has a {{glass cockpit}} with all-digital flight instruments. The {{monochrome}} head-up display offers a wide {{field of view}} {{and serves as a}} primary flight instrument; information is also displayed upon six color liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels. The primary flight controls are a force-sensitive side-stick controller and a pair of <b>throttles.</b> The USAF initially wanted to implement direct voice input (DVI) controls, but this was judged to be too technically risky and was abandoned. The canopy's dimensions are approximately 140inches long, 45inches wide, and 27inches tall (355cm x 115cm x 69cm) and weighs 360 pounds.|$|E
5|$|The Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was the inadequate consideration given to human factors limitations in the inspection and quality control procedures used by United Airlines' engine overhaul facility. These resulted in the failure to detect a fatigue crack originating from a previously undetected metallurgical defect located in a critical area of the titanium-alloy stage 1 fan disk that was manufactured by General Electric Aircraft Engines. The uncontained {{manner in which the}} engine failed resulted in high-speed metal fragments being hurled from the engine; these fragments penetrated the hydraulic lines of all three independent hydraulic systems on board the aircraft, which rapidly lost their hydraulic fluid. The subsequent catastrophic disintegration of the disk resulted in the liberation of debris in a pattern of distribution and with energy levels that exceeded the level of protection provided by design features of the hydraulic systems that operate the DC-10's flight controls; the flight crew lost its ability to operate nearly all of them. Despite these losses, the crew was able to attain and then maintain limited control by using the <b>throttles</b> to adjust thrust to the remaining wing-mounted engines. By using each engine independently, the crew made rough steering adjustments, and by using the engines together they were able to roughly adjust altitude. The crew guided the crippled jet to Sioux Gateway Airport and lined it up for landing on one of the runways. Without the use of flaps and slats, they were unable to slow down for landing, and were forced to attempt landing at a very high ground speed. The aircraft also landed at an extremely high rate of descent due to the inability to flare (reduce the rate of descent before touchdown by increasing pitch). As a result, upon touchdown the aircraft broke apart, rolled over and caught fire. The largest section came to rest in a cornfield next to the runway. Despite the ferocity of the accident, 185 (62.5%) passengers and crew survived owing to a variety of factors including the relatively controlled manner of the crash and the early notification of emergency services.|$|E

50|$|When {{the driver}} presses on the {{accelerator}} pedal, the <b>throttle</b> plate rotates within the <b>throttle</b> body, opening the <b>throttle</b> passage to allow more air into the intake manifold. Usually an airflow sensor measures this change and communicates with the ECU. The ECU then increases the amount of fuel {{being sent to the}} fuel injectors in order to obtain the desired air-fuel ratio. Often a <b>throttle</b> position sensor (TPS) is connected to the shaft of the <b>throttle</b> plate to provide the ECU with information on whether the <b>throttle</b> is in the idle position, wide-open <b>throttle</b> (WOT) position, or somewhere in between these extremes.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>throttle</b> {{position}} sensor (TPS) is a sensor {{used to monitor}} the <b>throttle</b> position of a vehicle. The sensor is usually located on the butterfly spindle/shaft {{so that it can}} directly monitor the position of the <b>throttle.</b> More advanced forms of the sensor are also used, for example an extra closed <b>throttle</b> {{position sensor}} (CTPS) may be employed to indicate that the <b>throttle</b> is completely closed. Some engine control units (ECUs) also control the <b>throttle</b> position electronic <b>throttle</b> control (ETC) or [...] "drive by wire" [...] systems and if that is done the position sensor is used in a feedback loop to enable that control.|$|R
25|$|In 2002, the RS-68 {{became the}} first large liquid-propellant rocket engine {{designed}} in the U.S. since the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) in the 1970s. The primary goal for the RS-68 was to reduce cost versus the SSME. Some sacrifice in chamber pressure and specific impulse was made, hurting efficiency; however, development time, part count, total cost, and assembly labor were reduced to {{a fraction of the}} SSME, despite the RS-68's significantly larger size. Typically, the RS-68 runs at 102% rated thrust for the first few minutes of flight, and then <b>throttles</b> down to 58% rated thrust before main engine cutoff. On the Heavy variant, the main CBC's engine <b>throttles</b> down to 58% rated thrust around 50 seconds after liftoff, while the strap-on CBCs remain at 102%. This allows the main CBC to conserve propellant and burn after booster separation. After the strap-on CBCs separate, the main CBC's engine <b>throttles</b> back up to 102% before throttling back down to 58% prior to main engine cutoff.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} ignition characteristics with air-throttling in an ethylene-fueled scramjet under flight Ma 6. 5 conditions was conducted. The dynamic process of air-throttling ignition was explored systematically. The influences of <b>throttling</b> parameters, i. e., <b>throttling</b> mass rate and duration, were investigated. When the <b>throttling</b> mass rate was 45 % of the inflow mass rate, ambient ethylene could be ignited reliably. The delay time from ignition to <b>throttling</b> was about 45 – 55  ms. There was a threshold of <b>throttling</b> duration under a certain <b>throttling</b> mass rate. It was shorter than 100  ms when the <b>throttling</b> mass rate was 45 %. While a 45 % <b>throttling</b> mass rate {{would make the}} shock train propagate upstream to the isolator entry in about 10 – 15  ms, four lower <b>throttling</b> mass rates were tested, including 30 %, 25 %, 20 %, and 10 %. All of these <b>throttling</b> mass rates could ignite ethylene. However, combustion performances varied with them. A higher <b>throttling</b> mass rate made more ethylene combust and produced higher wall pressure. Through these experiments, {{some aspects of the}} relationships between ignition, flame stabilization, combustion efficiency, and air-throttling parameters were brought to light.

The experiments are carried out with different mixture strength, stream velocity and <b>throttle</b> positions. It is observed that A/F ratio has no effect on SMD. However, stream velocity and <b>throttle</b> position have a significant influence on SMD. The new <b>throttling</b> method is found to be more effective in reducing the SMD, particularly at low <b>throttle</b> opening and high stream velocity compared to the conventional <b>throttle</b> plate...|$|R
25|$|Executed {{just above}} the runway, the flare arrests the aircraft's descent just prior to touchdown. By raising the aircraft's nose (pitching up) lift {{momentarily}} increases, reducing the descent rate, and allows the main wheels to gently contact the runway. During the flare, pilots retard the <b>throttles</b> to idle to reduce engine thrust. A squat switch in the main landing gear detects the touchdown and automatically deploys the spoilers, if armed. This destroys any remaining lift and helps the aircraft slow down.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{asymmetrical}} thrust {{has been}} used for directional control: if the left engine is idled and power is increased on the right side this will result in a yaw to the left, and vice versa. If throttle settings allow the <b>throttles</b> to be shifted without affecting the total amount of power, then yaw control can be combined with pitch control. If the aircraft is yawing, then the wing on the outside of this yaw movement will go faster than the inner wing. This creates higher lift on the faster wing, resulting in a rolling movement, which helps to make a turn.|$|E

It has also been shown that the cavitation erosion resistance of the secondary <b>throttling</b> pipeline is better than that of the ordinary <b>throttling</b> pipeline. Cavitations first appear at the entrance of <b>throttling</b> pipelines, and as the pressure difference between the two ends increases, the cavitations appears inwards.
