The ratio of ground defatted meal:solvent (1 : 30, w/v) used in the preliminary experiments would not be practical for industrial application, thus {{the use of a}} higher ratio (1 : 5, w/v) was evaluated. As expected, the results showed that when the meal: solvent ratio used for <b>protein</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>was</b> increased from 1 : 30 to 1 : 5, <b>protein</b> <b>extraction</b> efficiency decreased from 80 % to 60 %. The {{efficiency of}} <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> <b>extraction</b> process developed in this study was compared with that of a published protocol (Milanova et al. 2006).

40|$|Huge {{efforts have}} been made in extracting {{proteins}} from various sources for food applications. So far, proteins from two major sources (milk proteins and soy protein) are most widely used in the food industry, either as a general nutrients supply or as functional ingredients. Milk proteins (e. g., whey proteins or caseins) are probably the most commonly used proteins in all major types of food products (Fox and McSweeney, 1998). As from non-animal source, soy protein becomes increasingly used in food products because of its health benefits and characteristic physico-chemical properties (Endres, 2001; Hoogenkamp, 2005). Proteins from other sources have also been studied for their functionality and potential food applications. Examples include corn protein (Myers et al., 1994), wheat protein (Hettiarachchy and Ziegler, 1994), rice protein (Morita et al., 1996), seaweed protein (Fleurence, 1999), protein from yeast (Ganeva and Galutzov, 1999), fish protein (Afonso et al., 2004), etc. However, the applications of these proteins were still very limited, either due to the limited source of supply or the non-satisfactory functionality.

The data obtained suggest that different nutritional compositions led to the expression of different proteins derived from alternatives metabolic pathways expressed by the electrophoretic profiles. The construction of a database of protein fingerprints and numerical analysis based on such data, may have some implications in the classification and identification of such species with epidemiological, ecological and taxonomic purposes. A well defined or synthetic culture media seems to be much properly. Key words: oral yeasts, SDS-Page, numerical analysis, differentiation, protein extracts, culture media...|$|R

To understand plant’s response to the cold stress, former studies have led researchers to the identification of several proteins either in wheat or in other plants. In order to achieve further information regarding with the mechanism of spring wheat response to the cold stress at protein expression level, proteomics was applied for an Iranian local spring wheat cv. Kohdasht (LT 50 =− 4 to − 6 ∘C). Seedlings were first grown in a controlled growth room at 20 ∘C for 14 days and subsequently were transferred to 4 ∘C (experimental day 0) for 42 days (cold treatment), or they were maintained at 20 ∘C (control treatment). Sampling was done on days 0, 21 and 42 of <b>the</b> cold exposure. <b>Protein</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>was</b> carried out and two dimensional analysis were done. Proteins that showed at least two levels of expression changes were identified and mass spectrometry was carried out for their identification. The study led us to the identification of 92 proteins several of which seem to play important role in plant’s response to the cold stress such as cold regulated protein and ferredoxin-NADP(H) oxidoreductase as well as heat shock protein 70. Here we report proteomics analysis of cold responsive proteins and discuss their role in Kohdasht spring wheat cultivar...|$|R

A simple, integrated process {{was used to}} extract and purify <b>the</b> target <b>protein.</b> Chemical <b>extraction</b> <b>was</b> shown to {{be as effective as}} homogenization at releasing <b>the</b> inclusion body <b>proteins</b> from <b>the</b> bacteria] cells, with complete release taking less than 20 min. An expanded bed adsorption (EBA) column utilizing immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) was then used to purify <b>the</b> denatured KSI-(His(6)) <b>protein</b> directly from <b>the</b> chemical extract. This integrated process greatly simplifies the recovery and purification of inclusion body <b>proteins</b> by removing <b>the</b> need for mechanical cell disruption, repeated inclusion body centrifugation, and difficult clarification operations. The integrated chemical extraction and EBA process achieved a very high purity (99 %) and recovery (89 %) of the KSI-(His(6)), with efficient utilization of the adsorbent matrix (9. 74 mg KSI-(His(6)) /mL adsorbent).

O isolamento destas proteínas tóxicas é interessante tanto pela sua ação antinutricional, como pela sua aplicação em biotecnologia. Algumas lectinas necessitam da presença de íons divalentes para exercer sua atividade hemaglutinante (AH). O objetivo neste trabalho foi estudar diferentes métodos de extração da lectina da farinha de folhas de {{mandioca}} (FFM) e avaliar o efeito dos íons Ca 2 + e Mn 2 + para sua AH. Foram feitos testes de extração das proteínas utilizando dois extratores, água e solução salina (0, 15 mol. L- 1, pH 7, 4), em quatro tempos de extração, 15, 60, 120 e 180 minutos. Para avaliar o efeito dos íons Ca 2 + e Mn 2 + na AH da lectina da FFM, o extrato proteico foi dialisado contra EDTA e a AH determinada. O efeito desses cátions na aglutinação de hemácias também foi avaliado isoladamente. O método de extração proteica usando água destilada como extrator por 15 minutos é o mais adequado. Não houve perda da AH na ausência dos íons. Os cátions Ca 2 + (5 mmol. L- 1), Mn 2 + (1, 3 e 5 mmol. L- 1) e a mistura de ambos nas mesmas concentrações provocam aglutinação de hemácias, na ausência de lectina.

40|$|Summary With {{the rapidly}} growing world {{population}} and improving living standards, food demand is increased with a simultaneous desire for less human impact on the environment, such that “Twice the food production at half the ecological footprint” could be the EU goal for 2050. In fact, a boost in food demand is mainly required in developing countries, where the farmlands are limited and/or they are of poor quality. Rather than improving crop-production yield, developing biorefinery technology with unused biomass, such as leaves, in developing countries {{may be the key}} to fulfil the food demand. Four major components, protein, pectin, lignin, and (hemi-) cellulose, account for more than 70 % of the materials in leaves in almost all species. Among these components, protein and pectin can be used in food and animal feed, and they are key components for supplementing food production. However, the production and application of leaf products is limited for four reasons: unstable raw materials, complex components, rigid plant cell walls, and underdeveloped leaf logistics and economics. The limitations cause low pectin and protein yields, and low cost-efficiency in current extraction technologies, including mechanical milling, chemical extraction (acid and alkaline), solvent <b>extraction,</b> and ammonia <b>protein</b> <b>extraction.</b> Development of an integrated process for multiple products might be a good option for leaf biorefinery, but the compatibilities of these processes were unknown. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop new processes and applications that optimally utilize all components, particularly protein, of leafy biomass in the feed and/or food industry using green tea residues as a starting material. The method should also be applicable to other leafy biomass. The research started from the development of alkaline <b>protein</b> <b>extraction</b> technology as presented in Chapter 2. We found that in alkaline <b>protein</b> <b>extraction,</b> temperature, NaOH amount, and <b>extraction</b> time <b>are</b> <b>the</b> parameters determining <b>protein</b> yield, while pH and volume of <b>extraction</b> liquid <b>are</b> critical parameters for production cost. After optimization, more than 90 % of leaf protein could be extracted at a cost of 102 €/ton protein by single step alkaline <b>extraction.</b> <b>The</b> extracted <b>protein</b> nutritional value was comparable to soybean meal and this technique can be adapted to various leafy biomass. Main drawback of this technique is the overuse of alkali, generation of salts, and the destruction of key amino acids, such as lysine, during the extraction. We tried to overcome its drawbacks by developing integrated process with a recycle for chemicals. Chapter 3, 4, 5, and 6 refer to the integrated biorefinery. For a better design, we investigated how <b>the</b> alkali aided <b>protein</b> <b>extraction</b> (Chapter 3), and proved that alkaline <b>protein</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>was</b> not facilitated by increased solubility or hydrolysis of protein, but positively correlated to leaf tissue disruption. HG pectin, RGII pectin, polyphenols, and organic acids can be extracted before <b>protein.</b> <b>Protein</b> <b>extraction</b> can then <b>be</b> followed by the extraction of cellulose and hemi-cellulose. RGI pectin and lignin yield were both linearly correlated to protein yield, which indicated that they are likely to be the key limitation to leaf <b>protein</b> <b>extraction.</b> Based on <b>the</b> above findings, an integrated biorefinery that combined <b>protein</b> <b>extraction</b> with a pre-treatment was proposed. In Chapter 4, ethanol, viscozyme, and H 2 O 2 were selected for pre-treatments targeting on the removal of polyphenols and pigments, carbohydrates, and lignin accordingly. Ethanol and viscozyme could extract their targeting components efficiently while H 2 O 2 could bleach GTR with no lignin extracted. The best pre-treatment was the combination of viscozyme and 50 % ethanol extraction, which not only reduced the use of alkali by 50 %, but also improved protein content and its nutritional value. As pectin can be applied for food or chemicals, enzyme and PBS buffer were investigated for pectin extraction (Chapter 5). Both enzyme and PBS buffer extraction could not only extract high yield HG pectin (predominated by galacturonic acid) with no <b>protein</b> <b>extraction,</b> but also reduced alkali usage in subsequent <b>protein</b> <b>extraction.</b> Pectin obtained using PBS buffer could be present in its native form, which can be precipitated by 40 % ethanol. Buffer is suggested to extract pectins when pectins are to be used in food. Otherwise, hydrolyzed pectin that mainly contains galacturonic acid, can be converted to other useful chemicals. For this the enzymatic methods, such as using Viscozyme® L, are recommended. Alkali usage was further optimized. It was found that by using potassium hydroxide, <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> <b>extraction</b> efficiency <b>was</b> similar to that using sodium hydroxide. The waste water, mainly containing potassium salts, can then be used as fertilizer. This technique is highly depending on the location of factories, which should be built close to the field. Alternatively, calcium hydroxide can be used. As calcium salts can be precipitated by CO 2 and calcium hydroxide can be regenerated through burning of the precipitate, this scheme is sustainable and adaptable to most situations. However, as calcium also precipitated pectin, ployphenols, and even <b>proteins,</b> <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> yield is relatively low. Although a pre-treatment can improve extraction efficiency of calcium hydroxide, economic results suggested that a pre-treatment is not necessary unless the products obtained by pre-treatment have an attractive market value. In Chapter 7, we extend our knowledge on leaf biorefinery with some additional experiments and literature. Simplified models of leaf tissues and cell walls were proposed and used to explain the mechanism of alkaline <b>protein</b> <b>extraction.</b> <b>The</b> models <b>were</b> also used to explain other mechanisms for protein extraction; mechanical milling, steam explosion, acid, and enzyme aided extraction. The possible improvements of leaf biorefinery economics were illustrated either by reducing production cost, by e. g. using counter current extraction or ultrafiltration, or by upgrading product value by applying protein and pectin in food. The processes recommended in this thesis show an excellent prospective, in which they are applicable to other leaf biomass and suitable for small-scale production.  ...|$|R
