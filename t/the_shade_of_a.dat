5|$|In early 1816, the Territory {{approved}} a census and Pennington {{was named to}} be the census enumerator. The population of the territory {{was found to be}} 63,897, above the cutoff required for statehood. A constitutional convention met on June 10, 1816, in Corydon. Because of the heat of the season, the delegation moved outdoors on many days and wrote the constitution beneath <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> giant elm tree. The state's first constitution was completed on June 29, and elections were held in August to fill the offices of the new state government. In November Congress approved statehood.|$|E
5|$|Péron {{stated that}} the nest was usually {{situated}} near water {{and on the ground}} under <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bush. It was constructed of sticks and lined with dead leaves and moss; it was oval in shape and not very deep. He claimed that seven to nine eggs were laid always on 25 and 26 July, but the selective advantage of this breeding synchronisation is unknown. The female incubated the eggs, but the male apparently developed a brood patch, which indicates it contributed as well. The non-incubating parent also stayed by the nest, and the chicks left the nest two to three days after hatching. The eggs were preyed upon by snakes, rats, and quolls. Péron gave the incubation period as five or six weeks, but since the mainland emu incubates for 50 to 56 days, this may be too short. He stated a mother emu would defend its young from crows with its beak, but this is now known to be strictly male behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, a joint {{study by}} Manhattan College and the New York State Water Resources Institute found {{high levels of}} human fecal {{bacteria}} in the water, likely due to municipal wastewater. All 12 sites exceeded the state maximum of a monthly median of 200 organisms per 100 milliliters (ml) over five months. Levels were, as {{with most of the}} river's other pollutants, generally the highest near the mouth. However, the uppermost sampling site in the study, at the Chappaqua Metro-North station recorded the greatest single reading of any site, 1.2 × 10 organisms per 100 ml, as well as the second-highest; the researchers speculated that this was due to sewer overflow in the area at the times of those readings. Most of the high coliform readings came after rainfall except at the two sites furthest downstream; the study theorized that some older buildings in this area of Yonkers may still discharge sewage directly to the river. Since most of the Saw Mill River flows under <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> forest canopy, the bacteria may be less likely to be inactivated by sunlight than in other streams.|$|E

25|$|Numbers of the Portuguese force were rapidly reduced {{before the}} Sinhalese army charged {{up the hill}} and {{attacked}} them.

Approximately 4,000 soldiers of the Portuguese force were killed. Only 33 Portuguese soldiers were left alive, along with a number of mercenaries. Rajasinghe and Wijayapala ordered their men not to kill the survivors after the battle was won. Heads of the killed soldiers were piled before the Sinhalese king. A search was made for Melo's body, but it was not found. However, some Sinhalese soldiers found Melo's sword, and presented it to Rajasinghe.|$|E

25|$|In {{that stage}} thirteen, the {{temperature}} was extremely high. Two riders from the North African team, Marcel Molinès and Abdel-Kader Zaaf, broke away after 15 kilometers, and created a large gap, also because the other cyclists were more occupied with getting drinks. Some 20 kilometers from the finish, Zaaf started to zigzag across the road. A safety official pulled him from the race, afraid for his safety, and Molinès rode through alone. Zaaf {{did not agree with}} the safety official, and mounted his bicycle again. He quickly fell off his bicycle and fell asleep, and spectators moved him into <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tree. When he woke up, he realized that he was in a race, got on his bicycle again and rode away, but going into the wrong direction. An ambulance was called, and Zaaf was taken away. Zaaf claimed that he had received wine from a spectator, and as a Muslim he was not used to the alcohol. Behind the two North-African cyclists, Kübler had attacked, and left his rivals Raphaël Géminiani and Louison Bobet minutes behind. Of the favourites, only Ockers managed to stay with Kübler.|$|E
