Moving {{along the lines of}} the <b>triple</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> that analyzes the social, environmental and financial output of a given enterprise, PROUT advocates a measure of progress that encompasses the qualities of what could be termed a „fourth bottom line“ , characterized by the incorporation of a transcendental dimension of human life that focuses on the integrated development of the body, mind and spirit. This fourth bottom line will allow society in general and individuals in particular to develop an expanded sense of identity, allowing for a neo-humanistic will of inclusion, creating a society where material gains are not the summum bonum of life and allowing space to be created for people to work together in a symbiotic movement that primes for individual and collective welfare through social, cultural, as well as technological development.|$|E

In sustainable business design, {{it is crucial to}} consider interaction between the core business and external environment, which does not seem to influence the profit of the core business but necessary to explain their intended environmental and social value proposition. To construct a particular model of sustainable business, the paper conducted a survey on the study of business models and, in particular, sustainable business models (e. g., eco-innovations, sustainable innovations, product-service systems). The survey focuses on how the study models external environment and its influences on the core business characterized by “externality”. Through discussion on the findings of the literature review, three key issues to be addressed for constructing sustainable business model are identified: taxonomy of externality, identification of a set of models (i. e., aspect model), and identification of interrelationship among them. First and second issues clarify particular aspects of externality. By considering third issue, the designer is able to design sustainable business by integrating these aspects...|$|R

40|$|HOW CAN WE MEASURE THE SUSTAINABILITY? Nagy Tamás West-Hungarian University, Faculty of Economics István Széchenyi Management and Organisation Sciences Doctoral School The {{science has}} a lot of {{developed}} indicators to measure and monitor economic, social phenomena and processes and environmental conditions, but we want now to measure sustainability. The first step is to make an exact definition of the sustainability. The definition made by the Brundtland Commission has two bases: the duality of needs and limitations. For this reason the growth of human needs can only be achieved with harmonic development. The harmonic development is based upon three grounds: on the social forms, on the economical level and on the carrying capacity of natural systems. Therefore, the economical efficiency determines the social reasonableness, and these are limited by the carrying capacity of natural systems. To reach this goal, I analyzed the mainstream of the science in this regard. The Canadian National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy made six sustainability indicators. A US company called Sustainable Measures defined ten measurable interaction factors of the sustainable development. The Global Report Initiative uses <b>triple</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>lines</b> in the assessment. In my dissertation, I survey and compare these methods, and make proposals for usable routines for the European companies...|$|R

Sustainable business practices, on the other hand, integrate ecological concerns with social and economic ones (i.e., the <b>triple</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line).</b> Growth that depletes ecosystem services is sometimes termed [...] "uneconomic growth" [...] as it leads to a decline in quality of life. Minimizing such growth can provide opportunities for local businesses. For example, industrial waste can be treated as an [...] "economic resource in the wrong place". The benefits of waste reduction include savings from disposal costs, fewer environmental penalties, and reduced liability insurance. This may lead to increased market share due to an improved public image. Energy efficiency can also increase profits by reducing costs.|$|E

This view has been expressed {{as an illustration}} using three overlapping ellipses indicating that the three pillars of sustainability {{are not mutually exclusive}} and can be mutually reinforcing. In fact, the three pillars are interdependent, and in the long run none can exist without the others. The three pillars have served as a common ground for numerous sustainability standards and certification systems in recent years, in particular in the food industry. Standards which today explicitly refer to the <b>triple</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> include Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade and UTZ Certified. Some sustainability experts and practitioners have illustrated four pillars of sustainability, or a quadruple bottom line.

500|$|By this logic, market-based {{solutions}} to ecological crises (ecological economics, environmental economics, green economy) are rejected as technical tweaks {{that do not}} confront capitalism's structural failures. [...] "Low-risk" [...] technology/science-based solutions such as solar power, sustainable agriculture, and increases in energy efficiency are seen as necessary but insufficient. [...] "High-risk" [...] technological solutions such as nuclear power and climate engineering are entirely rejected. Attempts made by businesses to [...] "greenwash" [...] their practices are regarded as false advertising, and it is pointed out that implementation of renewable technology (such as Walmart's proposition to supply their electricity with solar power) has the effect opposite of reductions in resource consumption, viz. further economic growth. Sustainable business models and the <b>triple</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> are viewed as morally praiseworthy but ignorant to the tendency in capitalism for the distribution of wealth to become increasingly unequal and socially unstable/unsustainable. Ecosocialists claim that the general unwillingness of capitalists to tolerate—and capitalist governments to implement—constraints on maximum profit (such as ecotaxes or preservation and conservation measures) renders environmental reforms incapable of facilitating large-scale change: [...] "History teaches us that although capitalism has at times responded to environmental movements ... at a certain point, at which the system's underlying accumulation drive is affected, its resistance to environmental demands stiffens." [...] They also note that, up until the event of total ecological collapse, destruction caused by natural disasters generally causes an increase in economic growth and accumulation; thus, capitalists have no foreseeable motivation to reduce the probability of disasters (i.e. convert to sustainable/ecological production).|$|E

This leads to the necessity of a systems approach to decision-making in which economic, environmental and social factors are integrated together to ensure the <b>triple</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>lines</b> of sustainability. Although current studies provide a variety of different methodologies to address sustainability assessment and decision-making, the increasing size and complexity of industrial systems results in the necessity to develop more comprehensive systems approaches to ensure the sustainable development over a long time period for industrial systems. What 2 ̆ 7 s more, current research may conduct results based on one or only a few stages of the manufacturing process without considering all the stages of a product’s life. Therefore, the results could be bias and sometimes not feasible for the whole life-cycle. In the meanwhile, life cycle analysis (LCA) which has been widely adopted in a variety of industries does provide an effective approach to evaluate the environmental impact. The lack of life-cycle based economic and social sustainability assessment results in the difficult to conduct more comprehensive sustainability assessment. To address these challenges, three fundamental frameworks are developed in this dissertation, that is, life cycle based sustainability assessment (LCBSA) framework, life cycle based decision-making (LCBDM) framework, and fuzzy dynamic programming (FDP) based long-term multistage sustainable development framework. LCBSA can offer a profound insight of status quo of the sustainability performance over the whole life cycle. LCSA is then applied to assess the industrial system of automotive coating manufacturing process from raw material extraction, material manufacturing, product manufacturing to the recycle and disposal stage. The following LCBDM framework could then prioritize the sustainability improvement urgency and achieve comprehensive sustainable development by employing a two-phase decision-making methodology. In addition, FDP based long-term multistage sustainable development framework offers a comprehensive way to ascertain the achievement of long time sustainable development goal of complex and dynamic industrial systems by combining decision-making and sustainability assessment together...|$|R
