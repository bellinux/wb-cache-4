5|$|During {{this period}} Van Gogh {{mastered}} {{the use of}} light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees {{as if they are}} the source of light – almost in a sacred manner. Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including View of Arles, Flowering Orchards. Van Gogh was enthralled by <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>and</b> vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles. In the vivid light of the Mediterranean climate his palette significantly brightened.|$|E
5|$|His {{forms are}} usually abstractions {{of the human}} figure, {{typically}} depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures. Moore's works are usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces. Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>and</b> hills of his birthplace, Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Just as the 1630s replica {{has proven}} to be an {{accurate}} copy of the lost original, the panorama {{has proven to}} be a surprisingly reliable historical document offering a rare and detailed glimpse of medieval Stockholm. <b>The</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>and</b> a great number of notable buildings are correctly rendered in such great detail, that historical censorship, misinterpretations, and later restorations have not prevented modern research from repeatedly corroborating the painting's accuracy.|$|E

5|$|Mesa Verdeans used astronomical {{observations}} to plan their farming and religious ceremonies, drawing on both natural features in <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>and</b> masonry structures built for this purpose. Several great {{houses in the}} region were aligned to the cardinal directions, which positioned windows, doors, and walls along {{the path of the}} sun, whose rays would indicate the passing of seasons.

5|$|The {{habitat of}} the splendid fairywren ranges from forest to dry scrub, {{generally}} with ample vegetation for shelter.

5|$|The willie wagtail is insectivorous {{and spends}} much time chasing prey in open habitat. Its common name {{is derived from}} its habit of wagging its tail {{horizontally}} when foraging on the ground. Aggressive and territorial, the willie wagtail will often harass much larger birds such as the laughing kookaburra and wedge-tailed eagle. It has responded well to human alteration of <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>and</b> is a common sight in urban lawns, parks, and gardens. It was widely featured in Aboriginal folklore around the country as either a bringer of bad news or a stealer of secrets.|$|E

5|$|In {{the history}} of popular music, there are a {{relative}} handful of performers who have redefined {{the content of the}} music at critical points in history—people whose music left <b>the</b> <b>landscape,</b> <b>and</b> definition of popular music, altered completely. The Kingston Trio were one such group, transforming folk music into a hot commodity and creating a demand—where none had existed before—for young men (sometimes with women) strumming acoustic guitars and banjos and singing folk songs and folk-like novelty songs in harmony. On a purely commercial level, from 1957 until 1963, the Kingston Trio were the most vital and popular folk group in the world, and folk music was sufficiently popular as to make that a significant statement. Equally important, the original trio—Dave Guard, Nick Reynolds, and Bob Shane—in tandem with other, similar early acts such as the Limeliters, spearheaded a boom in the popularity of folk music that suddenly made the latter important to millions of listeners who previously had ignored it.|$|E
5|$|Joe Feddersen {{was born}} to a German American father and an Okanagan–Sinixt mother in Omak in 1953. Feddersen later became {{an active member of}} the Colville Indian Reservation and {{primarily}} serves as a sculptor, painter and photographer, known for creating artworks with strong geometric patterns reflective of <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>and</b> his Native American heritage. He was first exposed to printmaking at Wenatchee Valley College under the direction of Robert Graves and worked as an art instructor at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, after he earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Washington and his Masters of Fine Arts degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. In 2009, Feddersen moved back to Omak, after leaving his teaching position at the Evergreen State College.|$|E

The gardens featured on BBC TV's Gardens Through Time series, and cover more than , with three different styles of garden ranging from woodland walks to lakes and ponds to formal gardens. The Georgian landscape, Victorian shrubbery and terrace and the formal Edwardian gardens combine to create biodiversity and interest for visitors. The site is used by Lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros) as both a breeding and wintering roost site. Numbers of Lesser Horseshoes at this site are only exceeded by one other site in southwest England. The bats use roofspaces in a former stable block as a maternity site. It has been designated as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC).|$|E

5|$|Strong {{reveals that}} the {{procession}} {{was connected to the}} marriage of Henry Somerset, Lord Herbert, and Lady Anne Russell, one of the queen’s six maids of honour, on 16 June 1600. He identifies many of the individuals portrayed in the procession and shows that instead of a litter, as was previously assumed, Queen Elizabeth is sitting on a wheeled cart or chariot. Strong also suggests that <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>and</b> castles in the background are not intended to be realistic. In accordance with Elizabethan stylistic conventions, they are emblematic, here representing the Welsh properties of Edward Somerset, Earl of Worcester, to which his son Lord Herbert was the heir. The earl may have commissioned the picture to celebrate his appointment as Master of the Queen’s Horse in 1601.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from a third person {{perspective}} with the camera at a variable height and capable of rotating 360°, enabling the player to quickly move across the planet's terrain. While the terrain's topology is a torus, the map is locally projected onto a sphere to give {{the illusion of a}} planet. On maps where there is no fog of war, players can see what opponents are doing at any time. Extensive support for 3D acceleration enables the player to view the game in 16-bit or 32-bit colour. <b>The</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>and</b> real-time structure building and follower movement are also shown.|$|E
5|$|The {{installation}} of dams dramatically altered <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>and</b> ecosystem of the river. At one time, the Columbia {{was one of}} the top salmon-producing river systems in the world. Previously active fishing sites, such as Celilo Falls in the eastern Columbia River Gorge, have exhibited a sharp decline in fishing along the Columbia in the last century, and salmon populations have been dramatically reduced. Fish ladders have been installed at some dam sites to help the fish journey to spawning waters. Chief Joseph Dam has no fish ladders and completely blocks fish migration to the upper half of the Columbia River system.|$|E
