500|$|Jennings pleased {{some conservatives}} though, after his three-year {{lobbying}} {{effort to create}} a full-time religion correspondent at ABC News succeeded in the hiring of Peggy Wehmeyer in January 1994, making her the first such network reporter. ABC increased its coverage of religious topics, and in March 1995, Jennings anchored Peter Jennings Reporting: In the Name of God, a well-received documentary on the changing nature of American churches. At a taping of a [...] "town meeting" [...] segment for KOMO-TV of Seattle in February 1995, Jennings expressed regret for his ABC radio remarks on the 1994 midterm elections. [...] "People thought I had insulted their sacred mandate and some <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> go back to Canada," [...] he said. [...] "I hope I don't make that mistake again." ...|$|E
500|$|Karthi {{was born}} on 25 May 1977 in Madras (now Chennai), Tamil Nadu, India. He had his {{schooling}} at Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan and St. Bede's Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School, Chennai. He gained a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Crescent Engineering College, Chennai. After graduation, he worked as an Engineering consultant in Chennai and considered higher studies abroad. [...] "I was earning about [...] 5000, per month and found the work monotonous.

Karthi got a scholarship for his higher studies in the United States, and enrolled at Binghamton University, New York, where he earned his Master of Science in Industrial Engineering. While pursuing his masters, he also attended lectures on filmmaking.|$|E

500|$|With Election Special, Cooder {{wanted to}} write an album with direct lyrics and {{encourage}} urgency in listeners during the US presidential election of 2012. He felt that the election season was [...] "the time of decision in this country... the most critical {{time in the history}} of the country". When asked about concerns over [...] "", Cooder said in an interview for the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have a record that says, 'This here record is for you during election time.' Rather than be vague and poetic, let's just call this what it is. That way I may get people's attention. That's the idea." [...] Cooder drew on music he grew up listening to such as Depression-era songs and sought to appropriate contemporary subject matter to them. When writing the album, he also touched on the Occupy movement, which he felt optimistic about, saying that [...] "There's a sign of something. Those people are having conversations, and the conversations become issues and the issues become talked about. Pretty soon, the rest of the world picks up on it, even the politicians." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the long}} {{production}} of Ashes of Time, Wong faced a two-month break {{as he waited}} for equipment to re-record sound for some scenes. He was in a negative state, feeling heavy pressure from his backers and worrying about another failure, and so decided to start a new project: [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> do something to make myself feel comfortable about making films again. So I made Chungking Express, which I made like a student film." [...] Conceived and completed within only six weeks, the new project ended up being released two months before Ashes of Time.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2015, Eddie Murphy {{stated that}} his cameo {{appearance}} in the pilot ironically doomed the show's chances: [...] "I was gonna be in the pilot, and they <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be recurring. I’m not gonna do Beverly Hills Cop on TV. I remember when they tested it — they had this little knob that you turn {{if you like it}} or you don’t like it. So when Axel shows up in the pilot, some people turned the knob so much, they broke it. So the network decided 'if he isn’t recurring, then this isn’t gonna happen.' So it didn’t happen." ...|$|E
2500|$|As I chose on all {{occasions}} {{to appear as}} a Christian, I was told by some of them , that I {{was the only person}} they had ever met with, of whose understanding they had any opinion, who professed to believe Christianity. But on interrogating them on the subject, I soon found that they had given no proper attention to it, and did not really know what Christianity was ... Having conversed so much with unbelievers at home and abroad, I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be able to combat their prejudices with some advantage, and with this view I wrote ... the first part of my ‘Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever’, in proof of the doctrines of a God and a providence, and ... a second part, in defence of the evidences [...] of Christianity.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2006, {{various sources}} {{reported}} Shetty's joining PETA {{as part of}} an advertising campaign against the use of wild animals in circuses. According to a PETA India press release, Shetty is a long-time PETA supporter and has assisted the campaign by posing for photographs in a figure-hugging tiger costume. She explained that her crouching in a cage was uncomfortable during the photoshoot, but that her discomfort was insignificant compared to the pain suffered by the creatures. [...] "These once dignified animals only leave their cages, which are barely larger than the size of their bodies, for a few minutes each day to be forced into the ring to perform tricks which make no sense and are upsetting to them. The best way to help animals suffering in circuses is to boycott the circus". Shetty revealed in a later interview that she felt strongly about this cause and that she was appalled to hear of the cruel treatment suffered by such animals. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> stop that. If I can make a little difference to their lives, why not go for it?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Hatfield was {{profiled}} {{in a number}} of girls' magazines at this time and was embraced by many pre-teen and teenage girls as a role model due to the positive way she addressed serious issues faced by young women in her songs and interviews. About this period she says: [...] "I was never comfortable with the attention. I thought it had come too soon. I hadn’t earned it yet." [...] She gained notoriety in 1992 for saying that she was still a virgin in her mid-twenties in Interview magazine. In a 1994 interview for the magazine Vox, she said she was surprised by the effect 'outing' herself had: [...] "I {{think there are a lot}} of people out there who don't care about sex, but who you never hear from, so I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> say it. The magazine I did the interview for is full of beef-cake hunky guys and scantily-clad models, so I thought it would be really funny to say that I didn't care about sex in a magazine that's full of sex and beauty – but no one really got the joke." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of the 20th of last month, in the choir, after I had celebrated Mass I yielded to a {{drowsiness}} similar to a sweet sleep. [...] I saw before me a mysterious person similar to the one I had seen on the evening of 5 August. The only difference was that his hands and feet and side were dripping blood. This sight terrified me and what I felt at that moment is indescribable. I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have died if the Lord had not intervened and strengthened my heart which was about to burst out of my chest. The vision disappeared and I became aware that my hands, feet and side were dripping blood. Imagine the agony I experienced and continue to experience almost every day. The heart wound bleeds continually, especially from Thursday evening until Saturday. Dear Father, I am dying of pain because of the wounds and the resulting embarrassment I feel deep in my soul. I am afraid I shall bleed to death if the Lord does not hear my heartfelt supplication to relieve me of this condition. Will Jesus, who is so good, grant me this grace? Will he at least free me from the embarrassment caused by these outward signs? I will raise my voice and will not stop imploring him until in his mercy he takes away, not the wound or the pain, which is impossible since I wish to be inebriated with pain, but these outward signs which cause me such embarrassment and unbearable humiliation....the pain was so intense that I began to feel as if I were dying on the cross.|$|E
