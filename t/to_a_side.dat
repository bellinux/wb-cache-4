5|$|As built, both ships {{also carried}} 21 /51 caliber guns arrayed ten <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>side</b> with {{one in the}} stern, {{primarily}} for defense against destroyers and torpedo boats. Many of the 5-inch guns were poor in accuracy in rough seas due to being mounted near {{the ends of the}} ship and below the main deck. The ships were not designed with anti-aircraft (AA) defense in mind, and with the development of naval aviation, this was seen as a serious drawback to the class. The New York class was the first US battleship to mount anti-aircraft guns, with two /50 caliber guns mounted on platforms on top of the boat cranes of Texas in 1916. In 1918, the secondary armament was reduced to 16 5-inch/51 caliber guns, eight <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>side,</b> as the guns near the ends of the ship were difficult to work in any kind of sea. When both ships were refitted 1925-26, AA defense was increased with eight 3-inch/50 caliber guns arrayed four <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>side.</b> Six of the 16 remaining 5-inch guns were relocated higher in the ship to new casemates on the main deck. The New York class also initially featured four torpedo tubes, 1 each on the port side bow and stern and starboard bow and stern, for the Bliss-Leavitt Mark 3 torpedo, instead of the previous two, because of advances in torpedo performance increasing the prominence of the weapon. The torpedo rooms held 12 torpedoes total, plus 12 naval defense mines. However, the torpedo tubes were removed in the 1925-26 refit.|$|E
5|$|The game itself {{continued}} to evolve during this time. Numerous innovations {{to the rules}} and equipment were put forward as the NHL sought to improve {{the flow of the}} game and make the sport more fan-friendly. The NHL played with six men <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>side</b> rather than the traditional seven, and was among the first leagues to allow goaltenders to leave their feet to make saves. The NHL's footprint spread across Canada as Foster Hewitt's radio broadcasts were heard coast-to-coast starting in 1933.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} {{previous}} The Legend of Zelda games, solving puzzles and clearing dungeons remains a fundamental {{part of the}} gameplay. Progression through A Link Between Worlds is more open-ended than previous titles, {{with the possibility of}} tackling many of the game's dungeons in any order. Certain dungeon obstacles will require the use of the rented or purchased items. Towards the end of each dungeon, Link will encounter a boss that must be defeated. A unique mechanic that the game introduces is Link's ability to merge onto walls and move horizontally along them. Link is presented as a mural when he is merged on a wall, and upon merging, the game's perspective shifts <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>side</b> view to follow Link around corners. While merged to a wall, Link's energy gauge will deplete. The mechanic can be used for traversing the environment, reaching seemingly inaccessible areas, and avoiding hazards. It {{plays a key role in}} solving many of the game's puzzles and dungeons. Wall merging is also used as a means for travelling between Hyrule and Lorule, via fissures that connect the two kingdoms.|$|E

50|$|On 4 December 1984, {{locomotive}} No. 45 147 {{was badly}} damaged in the Eccles rail crash (1984), and subsequently moved <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>siding</b> {{where it was}} cut-up in March 1985.|$|R
5000|$|The halt {{closed in}} January 1960 but freight trains {{continued}} {{to pass the}} site for a further year. In 1964 the line, but not the halt, reopened from Blaenau southwards through {{the site of the}} halt <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>siding</b> near the site of [...] where a large ("Goliath") gantry was erected to load and unload traffic for the then new Trawsfynydd nuclear power station. The main goods transported were nuclear fuel rods carried in nuclear flasks. The line was also used during the late 1980s for freight traffic <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>siding</b> at [...] serving the explosives factory in Penrhyndeudraeth.|$|R
5|$|Crosses that precede an {{offensive}} bicycle kick are of dubious accuracy—German striker Klaus Fischer reportedly stated that most crosses {{prior to a}} bicycle kick are bad. Moreover, performing a bicycle kick is dangerous, even when done correctly, as it may harm a startled participant in the field. For this reason, Peruvian defender César González recommends that the player executing the bicycle kick have enough space to perform it. For the player using the manoeuvre, the greatest danger happens during the drop; a bad fall can injure the head, back, or wrist. Witzig recommends players attempting the move to land on their upper back, using their arms as support, and simultaneously rolling over <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>side</b> in order to diminish impact from the drop. A poor bicycle kick can also expose a player to ridicule.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mating}} season, rutting males move about {{in search of}} females in oestrus. Males become {{aggressive}} and fight among themselves for dominance. These fights are characterised by displays of the enlarged chest, the throat patch and the beard while holding the head upright; and threatening the opponent by running with the horns pointed toward him and circling him. The victorious bull would protect {{the vicinity of the}} targeted female from other males. The courtship typically lasts for 45 minutes. The male, stiff and composed, approaches the receptive female, who keeps her head low to the ground and may slowly walk forward. The male licks her genitalia, upon which the female holds her tail <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>side</b> and the male gives out a flehmen response. Finally, the male pushes his chest against her rump, and mounts her.|$|E
5|$|Professor Johannes Krahn, {{who built}} several churches and early skyscrapers {{such as the}} Beehive House in Frankfurt am Main, {{designed}} a space recalling elements of an early Romanesque Basilica. In a simple shape, a single long nave is concluded by a semicircle choir around the altar. On the right side the wall opens <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>side</b> chapel, reminiscent of a transept. The outer walls are sandstone, visible both inside and outside. Light flows in from a band of windows under the plain wooden ceiling. The combination of materials {{has been compared to}} Le Corbusier. The building recalls the austere style of sacred architecture of the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|There was an Express Dairies creamery {{and milk}} {{bottling}} plant {{close to the}} station served by milk trains from the Great Western Railway from Old Oak Common <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>siding</b> adjacent <b>to</b> the station.|$|R

5|$|The National Hockey League {{came into}} {{existence}} with the suspension of the NHA in 1917. After unsuccessfully resolving disputes with Eddie Livingstone, owner of the Toronto Blueshirts, executives of the three other NHA franchises—the Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Wanderers and Ottawa Senators—suspended the NHA, and formed the NHL, replacing Livingstone's team with a temporary team in Toronto, the Arenas. While new, the NHL was {{a continuation of the}} NHA. The NHL adopted the NHA's constitution, its rules, playing with six men <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>side</b> rather than the then-traditional seven and the NHA's split-season schedule. The owners originally intended the NHL to only operate for one season. However, the NHA was suspended permanently in 1918 and ceased to be an organisation in 1920. In 1921, the NHA championship trophy O'Brien Cup was adopted as the championship trophy of the NHL.|$|E

50|$|On the {{platform}} there was: a stone built building, a corrugated iron shelter and <b>a</b> water tower.Next <b>to</b> the single running line {{there was a}} passing loop, but towards {{the demise of the}} line it was shortened <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>siding</b> facing Gwiner Road station.|$|R
5000|$|The station {{buildings}} were demolished {{in the early}} 1960s, but the standard gauge platform remained in place. The cross-town link was built, passing the disused platform but not adjacent to it. The link enabled trains from the Conwy Valley Line to access the mothballed line from Blaenau southwards <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>siding</b> {{near the site of}} [...] where a large ("Goliath") gantry was erected to load and unload traffic for the then new Trawsfynydd nuclear power station.
