40|$|There are 600 GT of {{dissolved}} {{organic carbon}} (DOC) sequestered in seawater. The marine inventory of DOC is set by its concentration in the deep sea, which is nearly constant at 35 + 2 µM C, irrespective of sample location or depth. Isotopic measurements show deep sea DOC to be depleted in radiocarbon, with an apparent radiocarbon age of between 4000 ybp (Atlantic) and 6000 ybp (Pacific). From the radiocarbon data, we can infer that deep sea DOC is inert and does not cycle on less than millennial time scales. However, high precision DOC measurements show deep sea concentrations are variable at the + 1 - 2 µM DOC level, suggesting a fraction of deep sea DOC, equivalent to 15 - 30 Gt C, is cycling on short time scales, acting as a sink for new, atmospheric carbon. This project is designed to identify and quantify the biological and physical processes that sequester DOM in the deep sea by making compound specific radiocarbon measurements on sugars and proteins extracted from deep sea DOC. Our Hawaii surface seawater sample has a DIC Δ 14 C value of 72 + 7 ‰ and shows the influence of bomb radiocarbon on surface water DIC values. HMWDOC Δ 14 C is 10 ‰, significantly depleted in radiocarbon relative <b>to</b> <b>DIC.</b> Purification of HMWDOC by reverse phase HPLC yields seven neutral sugars with radiocarbon values of 47 – 67 ‰. Assuming the radiocarbon determinations of individual sugars in HMWDOC serve as replicates, then the average Δ 14 C for neutral sugars in HMWDOC is 57 + 6 ‰(1 SD, n= 11), only slightly depleted in 14 C relative <b>to</b> <b>DIC.</b> There has been a sharp decrease in radiocarbon values for DIC in the North Pacific Ocean {{over the past few}} decades. If neutral sugars cycle more slowly than DIC, we would expect them to have correspondingly higher radiocarbon values. Previous studies have modeled upper ocean DOC as a two component mixture of newly synthesized DOC with a radiocarbon value equal <b>to</b> <b>DIC,</b> <b>and</b> an old component with a radiocarbon value equal to deep sea DO 14 C. In order to measure the radiocarbon value of the old DOC component, we analyzed a molecularly uncharacterized carbon (MUC) fraction isolated from HMWDOC. Ten percent of HMWDOC is retained by the Biorex anion ion exchange resin, but eluted by NH 4 OH. This fraction has spectral characteristics nearly identical to deep sea HMWDOC (Fig. 2), and a Δ 14 C of– 416 ‰. Our Δ 14 C value for MUC in surface water is within the range of values for HMWDOC isolated from 900 - 5200 m at this site (- 380 to – 440 ‰), and significantly depleted relative to a sample of humic substances isolated at 10 m by adsorption onto XAD resin (- 342 ‰; Druffel et al. (1992)). Separation of MUC from the more reactive, newly synthesized component of HMWDOC as represented by neutral sugars in surface seawater yields a MUC fraction with radiocarbon depletions similar to deep sea (> 1000 - 5720 m) DO 14 C (- 501 to - 536 ‰, Druffel et al., 1992). Our analyses therefore verify the existence of both a newly synthesized and old fraction of DOC in surface seawater with radiocarbon values equal <b>to</b> <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> nearly equal <b>to</b> deep sea DOC. Neutral sugar concentrations decrease from 4 - 6 µM C or 13 - 21 % of HMWDOC in surface samples, to 0. 7 µM C or 6 % of HMWDOC at 600 m. The carbohydrate fraction of HMWDOC can be introduced into the mesopelagic ocean through two fundamentally different mechanisms. A small fraction of the reactive carbohydrate synthesized in the euphotic zone may escape degradation and be mixed into the mesopelagic ocean by advection. These sugars will have a radiocarbon value equal <b>to</b> <b>DIC</b> at depth. Alternatively, sugars could be introduced from the dissolution of rapidly sinking large particles. Reactive DOC injected by sinking particles will have radiocarbon values similar <b>to</b> surface water <b>DIC.</b> <b>To</b> distinguish these two mechanisms, we compared radiocarbon values of <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> neutral sugars in samples from 600 m. DIC Δ 14 C and HMWDOC Δ 14 C values at 600 m sample are – 155 + 7 ‰ and – 258 ‰ respectively, and are typical of values at this depth in the North Pacific Ocean. Neutral sugars at 600 m have radiocarbon values between – 108 and – 133 ‰, and are enriched by up to 150 ‰ relative to HMWDOC. The average Δ 14 C value obtained by treating glucose, galactose, xylose and mannose as replicates is – 123 + 10 ‰ (1 SD, n= 4), and is slightly enriched in radiocarbon relative <b>to</b> <b>DIC.</b> Our data suggest that some fraction of neutral sugars might be introduced by the dissolution of rapidly sinking particles. If we assume that neutral sugars at 600 m are a simple mixture of new carbon with a Δ 14 C value equal to surface water DIΔ 14 C, and older carbon with a Δ 14 C value equal to DIΔ 14 C at depth, then 15 % of the neutral sugars at 600 m are introduced by large, rapidly sinking particles...|$|R

So far, studies have examined the mechanisms protecting the affected kidney from glomerular thrombosis and cortical necrosis; but to the authors' knowledge, none has ever investigated the potential role of UO on the occurrence of the associated disseminated intravascular coagulation (<b>DIC)</b> episode leading <b>to</b> RCN. Female rats with a ligature of the right or left ureter were given injections, at different times after surgery, of 400 micrograms Salmonella typhosa 0901 endotoxin. Other experimental groups included normal and sham-operation rats and animals with a unilateral nephrectomy or with one kidney rendered ischemic by complete ligature of the renal vessels and of the ureter. All the animals were sacrificed 4 hours after endotoxin, and kidney sections stained with PTAH were examined for the presence of fibrin thrombi. Glomerular thrombosis was never observed in any hydronephrotic kidney, but occurred with a low incidence (16 %) in the contralateral organ in the group given endotoxin the second day after UO. The incidence and severity of glomerular capillary thrombosis gradually increased in the normal kidney as the delay between surgery and endotoxin was prolonged; the incidences (P less than 0. 01) were 45 % and 83 %, respectively, after 6 and 10 days. Endotoxin failed totally to initiate the lesion 1 day after UO as well as in normal, sham-operation and unilaterally nephrectomized rats, and in animals with combined UO and ligature of the renal circulation.

40|$|Objectives: Recent {{clinical}} {{data suggest}} that severe kala-azar (or visceral leishmaniasis) is an exaggerated innate immune response mediated by inflammatory cytokines, leading to a systemic inflammatory syndrome similar to what is observed in malaria, sepsis and other diseases. We tested this hypothesis by measuring serum cytokines in individuals with kala-azar. Methods: We compared patients with severe kala-azar (i. e. hemorrhagic manifestations, n 538) with patients without evidence of hemorrhage (n 596). We conducted a detailed clinical and laboratory evaluation, measuring serum IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 10, IL- 12, interferon-gamma, and TNF-alpha, and markers of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Results: Infants had higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, while HIV-infected patients had lower concentrations of IL- 10 and interferon-gamma. Higher levels of IL- 6, interferon-gamma, and IL- 8 were found among deceased patients. IL- 8 and interferon-gamma were independently associated with bleeding. Several cytokines were associated with different signs of severe clinical and laboratory manifestations, including DIC. IL- 6 was highly positively and independently associated with IL- 1 beta, IL- 8, IL- 10, and negatively associated with TNF-alpha. IL- 1 beta and TNF-alpha were also highly independently associated with disease severity. Conclusion: In its severe form, kala-azar, a neglected tropical disease, initiates a systemic inflammatory response that leads <b>to</b> <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> other manifestations. Children may have higher risk of death due to the more intense cytokine release. The data supports the notion that IL- 6 is the central cytokine {{that is associated with}} lethal disease, but interferon-gamma, IL 1 beta, IL- 8, and TNF-alpha are also involved with disease severity.

Acidification and alkalization did not necessarily show 1 : 1 stoichiometry; their kinetics for the apolar induction phase differed, and alkalization was less inhibited by 2. 5 mol m(- 3) DIC. At low irradiance (50 mu mol photons m(- 2) s(- 1)), where CCM activity in C- 4 leaves is minimized, both leaf types had similar DIC inhibition of pH polarity. However, as irradiance increased, DIC inhibition of C- 3 leaves decreased. In C- 4 leaves the CFM and CCM seemed to compete for photosynthetic ATP and/or reducing power. The CFM may require less, as at low irradiance it still operated maximally, if [DIC] was low. Iodoacetamide (IA), which inhibits CO 2 fixation in Hydrilla, also suppressed acidification and alkalization, especially in C- 4 leaves. IA does not inhibit the C- 4 CCM, {{which suggests that the}} CFM and CCM can operate independently. It has been hypothesized that irradiance <b>and</b> <b>DIC</b> regulate pH polarity by altering the chloroplastic [DIC], which effects the chloroplast redox state and subsequently redox regulation of a plasma-membrane H+-ATPase. The results lend partial support to a down-regulatory role for high chloroplastic [DIC], but do not exclude other sites of DIC action. IA inhibition of pH polarity seems inconsistent with the chloroplast NADPH/NADP(+) ratio being the redox transducer. The possibility that malate and oxaloacetate shuttling plays a role in CFM regulation requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{fixation}} of dissolved {{inorganic carbon}} (DIC) by marine phytoplankton provides an important feedback mechanism on concentrations of CO 2 in the atmosphere. As a consequence {{it is important to}} determine whether oceanic primary productivity is susceptible to changing atmospheric CO 2 levels Among numerous other factors, the acquisition of DIC by microalgae particularly in the polar seas is projected to {{have a significant effect on}} future phytoplanktonic production and hence atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. Using the isotopic disequilibrium technique the contribution of different carbon species (CO 2 and bicarbonate) <b>to</b> the overall <b>DIC</b> uptake <b>and</b> the extent to which external Carbonic Anhydrase (eCA) plays a role in facilitating DIC uptake was estimated. Simultaneous uptake of CO 2 and HCO 3 - was observed in all cases, but the proportions in which different <b>DIC</b> species contributed <b>to</b> carbon assimilation varied considerably between stations. Bicarbonate as well as CO 2 could be the major DIC source for local phytoplankton assemblages. There was a positive correlation between the contribution of CO 2 <b>to</b> total <b>DIC</b> uptake <b>and</b> ambient concentration of CO 2 in seawater suggesting that Southern Ocean microalgae could increase the proportion of CO 2 uptake under future high atmospheric CO 2 levels. Results will be discussed in view of metabolic costs related <b>to</b> <b>DIC</b> acquisition of Southern Ocean phytoplankton...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was to provide new insights on accumulation and possibleadverse effects of various non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in mussels, Mytilus gallo-provincialis, exposed to an environmentally realistic concentration (0. 5 g/L) of individual compounds,Acetaminophen (AMP), Diclofenac (DIC), Ibuprofen (IBU), Ketoprofen (KET) or Nimesulide (NIM). Themeasurement of drugs in mussel tissues was integrated with both functional alterations at cellular leveland transcriptomic responses. Results indicated the capability of mussels <b>to</b> accumulate <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> NIM,while AMP, IBU and KET were always below detection limit. A large panel of ecotoxicological biomark-ers revealed the early onset of alterations induced by tested NSAIDs on immunological responses, lipidmetabolism and DNA integrity. The gene transcription analysis through DNA microarrays, supported cel-lular biomarker results, with clear modulation {{of a large number}} of genes involved in the arachidonicacid and lipid metabolism, immune responses, cell cycle and DNA repair. The overall results indicatedan ecotoxicological concern for pharmaceuticals in M. galloprovincialis, with transcriptional responsesappearing as sensitive exposure biomarkers at low levels of exposure: such changes, however, are notalways paralleled by corresponding functional effects, suggesting caution when interpreting observedeffects in terms of perturbed cellular pathways. Fascinating similarities can also be proposed in the modeof action of NSAIDs between bivalves and vertebrate species...|$|R
