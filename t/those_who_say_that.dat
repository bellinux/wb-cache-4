5|$|As per Tulsidas, the Nirguna Brahman (quality-less impersonal absolute) and Saguna Brahman (personal God with qualities) {{are one and}} the same. Both, Saguna (qualified Brahman) and Aguna (or Nirguna - {{unqualified}} Brahman) are Akath (unspeakable), Agaadh (unfathomable), Anaadi (without beginning, {{in existence}} since eternity) and Anupa (without parallel) (अगुन सगुन दुइ ब्रह्म सरूपा। अकथ अगाध अनादि अनूपा॥). It is the devotion (Bhakti) of the devotee that forces the Nirguna Brahman which is quality-less, formless, invisible and unborn, to become Saguna Brahman with qualities. Tulsidas gives the example of water, snow and hail to explain this – the substance is the same in all three, but the same formless water solidifies to become hail or a mountain of snow – both of which have a form. Tulsidas also gives the simile of a lake – the Nirguna Brahman is like the lake with just water, while the Saguna Brahman is a lake resplendent with blooming lotuses. In the Uttar Kand of Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas describes in detail a debate between Kakbhushundi and Lomasa about whether God is Nirguna (as argued by Lomasa adhering to monism) or Saguna (as argued by Kakbhushundi adhering to dualism). Kakbhushundi repeatedly refutes all the arguments of Lomasa, to the point when Lomasa becomes angry and curses Kakbhushundi to be a crow. Lomasa repents later when Kakbhushundi happily accepts the curse but refuses to give up the Bhakti of Rama, the Saguna Brahman. Though Tulsidas holds both aspects of God to be equal, he favours the qualified Saguna aspect and the devotees of the highest category in the Ramcharitmanas repeatedly ask for the qualified Saguna aspect of Rama to dwell in their mind. Some authors contend from a few couplets in Ramcharitmanas and Vinay Patrika that Tulsidas has vigorously contradicted the denial of Avatar by Kabir. In several of his works, Kabir had said that the actual Rama is not the son of Dasharatha. In the Balkand of Ramcharitmanas, Shiva tells Parvati – <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the Rama whom the Vedas sing of and whom the sages contemplate on is different from the Rama of Raghu's race are possessed by the devil of delusion and do not know the difference between truth and falsehood. However, such allusions are based on interpretations of the text and do not hold much water when considered in the context of Ramcharitmanas. Tulsidas, in none of his works, has ever mentioned Kabir.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Systematic Chaos was generally positive. Writing for MetalReview.com, Jon Eardley called the album, [...] "another solid outing". He complimented Petrucci for [...] "Constant Motion", writing that it contains [...] "some {{of the best}} riffs Petrucci has brought to the table". In addition, he called {{the latter part of}} [...] "The Dark Eternal Night" [...] "the most brutal part in any song to date". Reviewing for Metal Invader, Nikos Patelis called the album, [...] "energetic, sharp– edged, full of beautiful melodies and heavy riffs, long epic compositions". He called Dream Theater's instrumentalists [...] "four masters of music that use their instruments as if they were their limbs", in addition to stating, [...] "James LaBrie sounds more mature than ever". In conclusion, Patelis called Systematic Chaos, [...] "an excellent album that needs many times to be listened in order to be digested". Greg Prato, of AllMusic, wrote [...] " [...] 'Forsaken' proves wrong <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Dream Theater is all about instrumental gymnastics and not songwriting". He also compared riffs in [...] "The Dark Eternal Night" [...] to the band Pantera. Overall, he states [...] " [...] the quintet sticks to the prog metal game plan that they've followed since their inception". Reviewer Chad Bowar of About.com, wrote that [...] "In the Presence of Enemies - Part I" [...] is [...] "an effective way to {{set the tone for the}} rest of the songs". Overall, Bowar gave the album four out of five stars, calling it, [...] "one of the best Dream Theater releases in quite a while".|$|E

She notes that while Article 15 of the UDHR does say [...] "Everyone {{has the right to}} a nationality", that right is [...] "ambiguous" [...] and [...] "weakly drafted".|$|E
2500|$|There are <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> to kill [...] Martin [...] is terrorism, but {{to attack}} an army camp is guerrilla warfare and to bomb civilians is {{professional}} warfare.

But nobody says that President Truman was a terrorist. All the men we went for individually – Wilkin, Martin, MacMichael and others – were personally interested in succeeding in the fight against us.|$|E
2500|$|... "Throughout the Middle East, {{the fear}} of free choices can no longer justify the denial of liberty.

It is tyranny that must be imposed. People choose democracy freely. And successful reform is always homegrown. Just look around the world today. For the first time in history, more people are citizens of democracies than of any other form of government. This is the result of choice, not of coercion. There are <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> democracy leads to chaos, or conflict, or terror. In fact, the opposite is true: Freedom and democracy are the only ideas powerful enough to overcome hatred, and division, and violence. For people of diverse races and religions, the inclusive nature of democracy can lift {{the fear of}} difference that some believe is a license to kill. But people of goodwill must choose to embrace the challenge of listening, and debating, and cooperating with one another. For neighboring countries with turbulent histories, democracy can help to build trust and settle old disputes with dignity. But leaders of vision and character must commit themselves to the difficult work that nurtures the hope of peace. And for all citizens with grievances, democracy can be a path to lasting justice. But the democratic system cannot function if certain groups have one foot in the realm of politics and one foot in the camp of terror." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later, Joseph Fielding Smith {{published}} his book Man: His Origin and Destiny, which denounced evolution without qualification. Similar statements of denunciation {{were made by}} Bruce R.

2500|$|Gove is {{generally}} considered as combining socially liberal views—e.g. on gay marriage —with a harder Eurosceptic and neoconservative position on foreign affairs.

In North America, China, and Taiwan, yakiniku is {{also referred to as}} [...] "Japanese barbecue" [...] In Japan the origin of yakiniku has become a subject of debate, though it is conventionally considered to have originated from or inspired by Korean cuisine.

2500|$|Aside {{from the}} issues of {{legality}} in some countries and states and of sometime opposition the effectiveness of speed cameras is very well documented. The introduction to [...] by Richard Allsop includes the following in the foreword by Professor Stephen Glaister, Director of the RAC (Royal Automobile Club). [...] "While this report fully lays out the background {{to the introduction of}} speed cameras and the need for speed limits, its job is not to justify why the national limits are what they are; a review of speed limits to see whether they are soundly based is for another day. What it has done is to show that at camera sites, speeds have been reduced, and that as a result, collisions resulting in injuries have fallen. The government has said that a decision on whether speed cameras should be funded must be taken at a local level. With the current pressure on public funds, there will be – indeed there already are – <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> what little money there is can be better spent. This report begs to differ. The devices are already there; they demonstrate value for money, yet are not significant revenue raisers for the Treasury; they are shown to save lives; and despite the headlines, most people accept the need for them. Speed cameras should never be the only weapon in the road safety armoury, but neither should they be absent from the battle." ...|$|E
