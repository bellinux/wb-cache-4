40|$|This paper {{presents}} a short theoretical background <b>of</b> <b>Talent</b> Management {{in the field}} of strategic HRM and specifies the characteristics of the public sector with regard to Talent Management. Furthermore, we distinguish two main approaches <b>of</b> <b>Talent</b> management: <b>exclusive</b> and inclusive <b>Talent</b> Management. <b>Exclusive</b> <b>Talent</b> Management is aimed at a specific segment of employees in the organization while inclusive Talent management includes every employee of the organization in implementing the Talent Management policy. We use this framework to position the approach of the Flemish Government. The results of the document analysis and the expert interviews indicate that the Flemish government focuses on the inclusive Talent Management realm. The view is that every employee has talents and these talents must be developed, in order to achieve organizational and individual goals. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This {{conceptual}} paper {{explores the}} relationship between an organization’s <b>exclusive</b> <b>talent</b> management (TM) practices, employees’ perceptions of <b>the</b> fairness of <b>exclusive</b> TM practices, and the corresponding impact on employee engagement. We propose that in organizations pursuing exclusive TM programs, employee perceptions of organizational justice of <b>the</b> <b>exclusive</b> TM practices may affect their employee engagement, which may influence both organizational and employee outcomes. Building on extant research, we present a conceptual framework depicting <b>the</b> relationship between <b>exclusive</b> TM practices, organizational justice and employee engagement, with social exchange theory and equity theory as the frame- work’s foundation. The propositions in the framework are each supported by the respective literature. The perceived organizational justice and potential ramifications of exclusive TM practices for employees who are not inclu- ded in corporate talent pools is an under-researched topic. The paper considers the perspectives of employees not included in corporate talent pools and explores how exclusive TM practices, as inputs, could lead to negative employee engagement outputs. In unpacking how exclu- sive TM practices could impact on employee engagement, the implications for organizations are underlined. The ethics and perceived fairness of exclusive TM practices, which {{have the potential to}} marginalize employees and lead to their disengagement, are considered...|$|R

40|$|This {{working paper}} studies the effect <b>of</b> <b>talent</b> {{management}} on job satisfaction in public sector organizations. As {{we argue that}} talent management {{is most likely to}} take an hybrid or inclusive approach in the public sector, the construct of basic needs satisfaction is proposed as mediator. While <b>exclusive</b> <b>talent</b> management is mainly occupied with organizational goals, an inclusive as well as an hybrid approach to talent management creates room to incorporate a multi‐dimensional performance concept. As a consequence, well‐being and societal goals can be incorporated as part of the aspirations of an organization. In this regard, the three identified needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness within the construct of basic needs satisfaction are expected to be positively influenced through the implementation <b>of</b> <b>talent</b> management in public sector organizations. As basic needs satisfaction in literature is described as an important predictor of job satisfaction, we expect to find a direct and indirect effect <b>of</b> <b>talent</b> management on job satisfaction. This working paper presents our conceptual model and the hypotheses that are developed. The analysis, however, shows no direct nor indirect effect <b>of</b> <b>talent</b> management on job satisfaction. Several suggestions, of which some based on qualitative research in the organizations under study, are proposed to explain this result. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of {{agreements}} that prohibit "superstars" from switching their services to rivals on firms' ability to collude. Exclusivity (or non-compete) clauses are not uncommon in the sports,entertainment and professional services industries, but courts often refrain from enforcing them owing to inequity and/or restraint of trade considerations. We argue this attitude may be misguided. While in the collusive path exclusion may be inconsequential because firms agree not to hire each other's star, its enforcement level aspects the severity of future punishments. For <b>exclusive</b> <b>talent</b> may not be poached by rivals. The ability to sustain tacit collusion may thus be impaired, which in plausible constellations leads to efficiency improvements and more equitable distribution of rents. ...|$|R

40|$|When {{reading about}} Talent Management in {{academic}} literature, {{it is clear}} that different approaches and conceptualizations of the concepts <b>of</b> <b>talent</b> and Talent Management exist (Lewis & Heckman, 2006; Armstrong, 2006; Thunissen, Boselie & Fruytier, 2011; Buttiens & Hondeghem, 2012 a; Gallardo-Gallardo, 2012). Next to these differences in approach and conceptualization, various goals and HR processes can be put forward when developing a Talent Management policy. This paper tries to draw an overall picture of the specific approaches, goals and HR processes <b>of</b> <b>Talent</b> management in a public sector context. More specific, we focus on the architecture <b>of</b> <b>Talent</b> management policies in 46 organizations of the Flemish Government. As a broader framework, this paper uses the distinction between inclusive and <b>exclusive</b> <b>Talent</b> Management (as proposed in Buttiens & Hondeghem, 2012 a). The first part of the paper introduces some of the basic principles <b>of</b> <b>Talent</b> Management (e. g. value of human capital). In other words, the theories which are at the core <b>of</b> the different <b>Talent</b> management practices will be presented. Furthermore, the division of the different approaches <b>of</b> <b>Talent</b> Management (inclusive/exclusive) will be put forward. In the second part, the specific context <b>of</b> <b>Talent</b> management in the public sector is depicted. We link the public sector values with the design and development <b>of</b> a <b>Talent</b> management policy. Furthermore, the theory of strategic balance (Paauwe, 2004; Boselie, 2010) and new institutionalism (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Greenwood & Hinings, 1996, Lammers et al., 2000 in Paauwe & Boselie, 2007) will be presented to fit Talent management {{within the context of the}} public sector. Although a theoretical framework is being put forward in this paper, we approach the results in an exploratory manner. Where possible, the results will be framed in our theoretical scope. In the third part, the methodology and course of the research is presented. The used research method is an online questionnaire, which was addressed to the heads of the HR departments of 46 organizations in the Flemish Government. The respondents were asked to express the view of the organization and to describe the goals and practices regarding Talent management. The fourth part focuses on the results of the questionnaire. We conclude by discussing results and future research possibilities. status: publishe...|$|R
