This {{also applies to}} explanations of in vitro fertilization (IVF) {{in the field of}} infertility treatment. This is because the cause of infertility differs from couple to couple, and because the explanations must begin with the mechanism of pregnancy. Recently, explanations facilitated by tablet terminals have been used in the field of medicine. In the present study, the efficacy and problems of explanations facilitated by tablet terminals were evaluated and compared with the explanations of IVF facilitated by paper-based pamphlets. Methods A total of 249 couples were asked to read a paper-based pamphlet explaining IVF treatment, while 252 couples were asked to view an explanation on a <b>tablet</b> <b>terminal.</b> The patients then answered a seven-item questionnaire. The answers to the questionnaire were based on a three-point scale, and statistical analysis was performed with the Mann-Whitney U test. Results Patients responded that the explanation facilitated by the <b>tablet</b> <b>terminal</b> was significantly easier to understand for all seven questionnaire items (p 2 ̆ 009 < 0. 05). The answer 2 ̆ 018 I did not understand 2 ̆ 019 was selected for the items related to 2 ̆ 018 The treatment fees 2 ̆ 019 (4. 8...|$|E

Using {{a very sensitive}} GC-MS technique plasma TFP concentrations were measured up until 24 h following drug ingestion. Peak plasma concentrations varied widely (range 0. 53 - 3. 09 ng ml- 1) and were reached 2. 8 +/- 0. 5 h following ingestion of the TFP <b>tablet.</b> The apparent <b>terminal</b> elimination half-life of TFP was 12. 5 +/- 1. 4 h. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve differed widely between subjects (range: 5. 9 - 17. 6 ng ml- 1 h) suggesting large individual differences in the extent of presystemic TFP elimination...|$|R
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} {{of a novel}} 20 mg biphasic release tablet of nifedipine {{were compared}} with the conventional 10 mg capsule and 20 mg sustained release preparations in healthy volunteers. The influence of food and posture on the pharmacokinetics of the biphasic tablet were studied. In the fasting state, the time to peak concentration of nifedipine was not significantly different between the 20 mg biphasic and 20 mg sustained release tablets, but plasma concentrations were higher between 2 and 4 h after the biphasic <b>tablet.</b> The <b>terminal</b> elimination half-lives of the two formulations were similar. In subjects who fed prior to nifedipine administration {{there was no significant}} difference between either the peak plasma concentration or terminal half-life of the biphasic tablet and two 10 mg capsules of nifedipine. When the biphasic preparation was given after a standard breakfast, the time to peak plasma concentration was significantly longer and the terminal half-life shorter than when given in the fasting state. The dissolution characteristics of the biphasic tablet were influenced by prior administration of food to an extent which may be of clinical significance during twice daily administration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A new {{context-aware}} data- and patient-centric {{paradigm for}} ubiquitous healthcare {{is central to}} deliver personalized healthcare solutions to the elderly and the physically challenged. However, this new paradigm requires real-time inthe-field processing of wirelessly collected vital signs using inherently complex physiological models {{and analysis of the}} processed information (derived physiological parameters) under context (e. g., location, ambient conditions, current physical activity) to extract knowledge about the health condition of patients. As the computational capabilities of biomedical sensor nodes are insufficient to run these models, an innovative resource provisioning framework that harnesses the computing capabilities of under-utilized electronic devices in the vicinity (e. g., smart phones, laptops, <b>tablets,</b> DVRs, medical <b>terminals)</b> to form a mobile computing grid is presented. The framework is imparted with self-optimization and self-healing capabilities for efficiency and robustness under uncertainty, respectively. The proposed mobile grid management framework serves as a key enabling technology for Internet-of-Things- (IoT-) based next-generation ubiquitous healthcare solutions. I...|$|R
40|$|Interpersonal {{exchanges between}} {{customers}} and frontline service employees increasingly involve {{the use of}} technology, such as point-of-sale <b>terminals,</b> <b>tablets,</b> and kiosks. The present research draws on role and script theories to demonstrate that customer reactions to technology-infused service exchanges depend {{on the presence of}} employee rapport. When rapport is present during the exchange, the use of technology functions as an interpersonal barrier preventing the customer from responding in kind to employee rapport-building efforts, thereby decreasing service encounter evaluations. However, during service encounters in which employees are not engaging in rapport building, technology functions as an interpersonal barrier, enabling customers to retreat from the relatively unpleasant service interaction, thereby increasing service encounter evaluations. Two analyses using J. D. Power Guest Satisfaction Index data support the barrier and beneficial effects of technology use during service encounters with and without rapport, respectively. A follow-up experiment replicates this data pattern and identifies psychological discomfort as a key process that governs the effect. For managers, the results demonstrate the inherent incompatibility of initiatives designed to encourage employee–customer rapport with those that introduce technology into frontline service exchanges...|$|R
40|$|While {{sound and}} video may capture viewers’ attention, {{interaction}} can captivate them. This {{has not been}} available prior to the advent of Digital Television. In fact, what {{lies at the heart}} of the Digital Television revolution is this new type of interactive content, offered in the form of interactive Television (iTV) services. On top of that, the new world of converged networks has created a demand for a new type of converged services on a range of mobile <b>terminals</b> (<b>Tablet</b> PCs, PDAs and mobile phones). This paper aims at presenting a new approach to service creation that allows for the semi-automatic translation of simulations and rapid prototypes created in the accessible desktop multimedia authoring package Macromedia Director into services ready for broadcast. This is achieved by a series of tools that de-skill and speed-up the process of creating digital TV user interfaces (UI) and applications for mobile terminals. The benefits of rapid prototyping are essential for the production of these new types of services, and are therefore discussed in the first section of this paper. In the following sections, an overview of the operation of content, service, creation and management sub-systems is presented, which illustrates why these tools compose an important and integral part of a system responsible of creating, delivering and managing converged broadcast and telecommunications services. The next section examines a number of metadata languages candidates for describing the iTV services user interface and the schema language adopted in this project. A detailed description of the operation of the two tools is provided to offer an insight of how they can be used to de-skill and speed-up the process of creating digital TV user interfaces and applications for mobile terminals. Finally, representative broadcast oriented and telecommunication oriented converged service components are also introduced, demonstrating how these tools have been used to generate different types of services...|$|R
