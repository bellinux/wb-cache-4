25|$|Leptin is {{a protein}} hormone {{produced}} by adipose tissue. Its primary <b>target</b> <b>organ</b> is the hypothalamus. The leptin level seems {{to provide the}} brain a rough indicator of adipose mass for purposes of regulation of appetite and energy metabolism. It also plays a permissive role in female puberty, which usually will not proceed until an adequate body mass has been achieved.|$|E
25|$|A good nanovector for siRNA {{delivery}} should protect siRNA from degradation, enrich siRNA in the <b>target</b> <b>organ</b> {{and facilitate}} the cellular uptake of siRNA. The three main groups of siRNA nanovectors are: lipid based, non-lipid organic-based, and inorganic. Lipid based nanovectors are excellent for delivering siRNA to solid tumors, but other cancers may require different non-lipid based organic nanovectors such as cyclodextrin based nanoparticles.|$|E
25|$|The {{expression}} of aflatoxin-related diseases {{is influenced by}} factors such as species, age, nutrition, sex, {{and the possibility of}} concurrent exposure to other toxins. The main <b>target</b> <b>organ</b> in mammals is the liver, so aflatoxicosis primarily is a hepatic disease. Conditions increasing the likelihood of aflatoxicosis in humans include limited availability of food, environmental conditions that favour mould growth on foodstuffs, and lack of regulatory systems for aflatoxin monitoring and control.|$|E

25|$|GH also stimulates, {{through the}} JAK-STAT {{signaling}} pathway, {{the production of}} {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1, formerly known as somatomedin C), a hormone homologous to proinsulin. The liver is a major <b>target</b> <b>organ</b> of GH for this process and is the principal site of IGF-1 production. IGF-1 has growth-stimulating effects {{on a wide variety of}} tissues. Additional IGF-1 is generated within target tissues, making it what appears to be both an endocrine and an autocrine/paracrine hormone. IGF-1 also has stimulatory effects on osteoblast and chondrocyte activity to promote bone growth.|$|E
25|$|IMT is {{occasionally}} used {{in clinical}} practice, but its role is not clear. After systematically reviewing the evidence base for IMT, the United States Preventive Services Task Force found no support for its routine use in stratification of risk for people at intermediate cardiovascular risk. However, in 2003 the European Society of Hypertension–European Society of Cardiology {{guidelines for the}} management of arterial hypertension recommended the use of IMT measurements in high-risk patients to help identify <b>target</b> <b>organ</b> damage and in 2010 the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology advocated the use of IMT on intermediate risk patients if usual risk classification was not satisfactory.|$|E
25|$|Recent studies {{claim that}} obesity {{is a risk}} factor for {{hypertension}} because of activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in adipose tissue, and also linked renin-angiotensin system with insulin resistance, and claims that anyone can cause the other. Local production of angiotensin II in various tissues, including the blood vessels, heart, adrenals, and brain, is controlled by ACE and other enzymes, including the serine protease chymase. The activity of local renin–angiotensin systems and alternative pathways of angiotensin II formation may make an important contribution to remodeling of resistance vessels and the development of <b>target</b> <b>organ</b> damage (i.e. left ventricular hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, atherosclerosis, stroke, end-stage kidney disease, myocardial infarction, and arterial aneurysm) in hypertensive persons.|$|E

25|$|The {{endothelium}} {{of blood}} vessels produces an extensive range of substances that influence blood flow and, in turn, is affected by changes in the blood and the pressure of blood flow. For example, local nitric oxide and endothelin, which are secreted by the endothelium, are the major regulators of vascular tone and blood pressure. In patients with essential hypertension, the balance between the vasodilators and the vasoconstrictors is upset, which leads {{to changes in the}} endothelium and sets up a “vicious cycle” that contributes to the maintenance of high blood pressure. In patients with hypertension, endothelial activation and damage also lead to changes in vascular tone, vascular reactivity, and coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways. Alterations in endothelial function are a reliable indicator of <b>target</b> <b>organ</b> damage and atherosclerotic disease, as well as prognosis.|$|E
25|$|For most people, {{the first}} {{symptoms}} result from atheroma progression within the heart arteries, most commonly {{resulting in a}} heart attack and ensuing debility. However, the heart arteries, because (a) they are small (from about 5mm down to microscopic), (b) they are hidden deep within the chest and (c) they never stop moving, have been a difficult <b>target</b> <b>organ</b> to track, especially clinically in individuals who are still asymptomatic. Additionally, all mass-applied clinical strategies focus on both (a) minimal cost and (b) the overall safety of the procedure. Therefore, existing diagnostic strategies for detecting atheroma and tracking response to treatment have been extremely limited. The methods most commonly relied upon, patient symptoms and cardiac stress testing, do not detect any symptoms of the problem until atheromatous disease is very advanced because arteries enlarge, not constrict in response to increasing atheroma. It is plaque ruptures, producing debris and clots which obstruct blood flow downstream, sometimes also locally (as seen on angiograms), which reduce/stop blood flow. Yet these events occur suddenly and are not revealed in advance by either stress testing, stress tests or angiograms.|$|E
25|$|Phosphine can {{be absorbed}} into the body by inhalation. Direct contact with {{phosphine}} liquid – although unlikely to occur – may cause frostbite, like other cryogenic liquids. The main <b>target</b> <b>organ</b> of phosphine gas is the respiratory tract. According to the 2009 U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) pocket guide, and U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation, the 8 hour average respiratory exposure should not exceed 0.3 ppm. NIOSH recommends that the short term respiratory exposure to phosphine gas should not exceed 1ppm. The Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health level is 50ppm. Overexposure to phosphine gas causes nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, thirst, chest tightness, dyspnea (breathing difficulty), muscle pain, chills, stupor or syncope, and pulmonary edema. Phosphine {{has been reported to}} have the odor of decaying fish or garlic at concentrations below 0.3 ppm. The smell is normally restricted to laboratory areas or phosphine processing since the smell comes from the way the phosphine is extracted from the environment. However, it may occur elsewhere, such as in industrial waste landfills. Exposure to higher concentrations may cause olfactory fatigue.|$|E
40|$|In {{small bowel}} {{transplantation}} (SBTx), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is mediated by donor-derived T cells recognizing host {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) alloantigens, and represents an important immunological event influencing life in experimental and clinical situations. We evaluated {{the possibility that a}} new sphingosine 1 -phosphate receptor agonist, FTY 720, could diminish GVHD in a rat SBTx model through traffic alteration of donor-derived T cells in <b>target</b> <b>organs.</b> Heterotopic SBTx was performed using a parent (WF) -into-F 1 (WF × ACI) rat combination. Recipient survival, body weight, histopathology, donor-derived T cell subpopulation and cytokine production were compared with untreated controls. FTY 720 inhibited lethality and histopathological changes in <b>target</b> <b>organs</b> when administered at 0 · 5 mg/kg, possibly due to sequestration of donor-derived T cells in the intestinal graft. FTY 720 caused a significant reduction in donor T cell numbers in <b>target</b> <b>organs</b> by promoting these cells to home into donor, but not recipient, secondary lymphoid tissues. FTY 720 significantly decreased production of interferon (IFN) -γ in <b>target</b> <b>organs.</b> These findings indicate that FTY 720 effectively reduced recirculation of activated donor-derived T cells and recruitment to <b>target</b> <b>organs</b> in GVHD, and was also associated with down-regulated IFN-γ production. These properties may offer the potential to treat ongoing GVHD in SBTx...|$|R

40|$|Anterior {{pituitary}} tissue was implanted {{into the}} hypothalamus, {{other parts of}} the brain and beneath the renal capsule of rats. Grafts in the ventral hypothalamus could retain a normal histological appearance despite a lack of any contact with the capillary loop system of the median eminence. By observing the location of basophils in the grafts a 'hypophysiotrophic' area has been defined. In other sites the histological structure of the grafts was not maintained. In animals with grafts in the hypophysiotrophic area the <b>target</b> <b>organs</b> might be well preserved, though sometimes the gonads were preserved and other <b>target</b> <b>organs</b> atrophied. Grafts in other sites always led to atrophy of the <b>target</b> <b>organs.</b> It is concluded that the material from the hypothalamus essential for the maintenance of anterior pituitary structure and function is not simply a synaptic mediator discharged by nerve terminals into the portal circulation, but a true neurosecretory substance produced by and available from small neurones in the hypothalamus. introductio...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{close link}} between {{hypertension}} and atherosderosis. Hypertension causes atherosclerotic damage of several <b>organs,</b> called <b>target</b> <b>organs</b> and the risk factors for hypertension and atherosderosis are very similar. The risk of mortality associated to hypertension increases with blood pressure values below the cutoff point of normality (140 / 90 mm Hg), even below 130 / 85 mm Hg, and includes a stage called pre hypertension. Moreover, the initial damage of the arterial walls and <b>target</b> <b>organs</b> are present before {{there is a significant}} elevation of blood pressure. Therefore, hypertension could become a biological marker of the evolution of an underlying atherosclerotic process. A new pathophysiological paradigm has been proposed in which the severity of hypertension is not classified according to blood pressure values, but rather on the initiation and progression of vascular damage among <b>target</b> <b>organs.</b> These alterations determine the prognosis and management of systemic vascular damage that can be called "hypertensive atherosclerotic disease" or simply systemic atherosclerotic disease...|$|R
50|$|Gonadotropins are {{released}} {{under the control}} of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the arcuate nucleus and preoptic area of the hypothalamus.

The gonadotropins affect multiple cell types and elicit multiple responses from the <b>target</b> <b>organs.</b> As a simplified generalization, LH stimulates the Leydig cells of the testes and the theca cells of the ovaries to produce testosterone (and indirectly estradiol), whereas FSH stimulates the spermatogenic tissue of the testes and the granulosa cells of ovarian follicles, as well as stimulating production of estrogen by the ovaries.|$|R

40|$|The {{leading cause}} of death in breast cancer {{patients}} is tumor metastasis. This process includes several steps that all need to be completed successfully to develop distant metastatic disease. Tumor cells disseminate from the primary tumor and cross multiple barriers like the basement membrane and extracellular matrix. Subsequently, tumor cells enter the circulation by a process called intravasation, and they are transported throughout the body. At specific sites, tumor cells adhere to the blood vessel walls, breach the vascular endothelium (extravasation) and colonize <b>target</b> <b>organs.</b> Breast cancer shows striking tissue tropism for the formation of metastases in lung, bone, brain and liver. The molecular mechanisms underlying this specificity are not yet known, but most likely it is caused by an interplay between tumor cells and the microenvironment at <b>target</b> <b>organs.</b> Studies have shown that, before arrival of tumor cells, the microenvironment in <b>target</b> <b>organs</b> is modulated to form a permissive ‘pre-metastatic niche’.
