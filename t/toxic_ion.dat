40|$|AbstractIn Alzheimer's disease, calcium {{permeability}} through {{cellular membranes}} appears to underlie neuronal cell death. It is increasingly accepted that calcium permeability involves <b>toxic</b> <b>ion</b> channels. We modeled Alzheimer's disease ion channels {{of different sizes}} (12 -mer to 36 -mer) in the lipid bilayer using molecular dynamics simulations. Our Aβ channels consist of the solid-state NMR-based U-shaped β-strand-turn-β-strand motif. In the simulations we obtain ion-permeable channels whose subunit morphologies and shapes are consistent with electron microscopy/atomic force microscopy. In agreement with imaged channels, the simulations indicate that β-sheet channels break into loosely associated mobile β-sheet subunits. The preferred channel sizes (16 - to 24 -mer) are compatible with electron microscopy/atomic force microscopy-derived dimensions. Mobile subunits were also observed for β-sheet channels formed by cytolytic PG- 1 β-hairpins. The emerging picture from our large-scale simulations is that <b>toxic</b> <b>ion</b> channels formed by β-sheets spontaneously break into loosely interacting dynamic units that associate and dissociate leading to toxic ionic flux. This sharply contrasts intact conventional gated ion channels that consist of tightly interacting α-helices that robustly prevent ion leakage, rather than hydrogen-bonded β-strands. The simulations suggest why conventional gated channels evolved to consist of interacting α-helices rather than hydrogen-bonded β-strands that tend to break in fluidic bilayers. Nature designs folded channels but not misfolded toxic channels...|$|E

40|$|Elevated {{levels of}} copper or silver ions in the {{environment}} are an immediate threat to many organisms. Escherichia coli is able to resist the toxic effects of these ions through strictly limiting intracellular levels of Cu(I) and Ag(I). The CusCFBA system is one system in E. coli responsible for copper/silver tolerance. A key component of this system is the periplasmic copper/silver-binding protein, CusF. Here the X-ray structure and XAS data on the CusF–Ag(I) and CusF–Cu(I) complexes, respectively, are reported. In the CusF–Ag(I) structure, Ag(I) is coordinated by two methionines and a histidine, with a nearby tryptophan capping the metal site. EXAFS measurements on the CusF–Cu(I) complex show a similar environment for Cu(I). The arrangement of ligands effectively sequesters the metal from its periplasmic environment and thus {{may play a role}} in protecting the cell from the <b>toxic</b> <b>ion...</b>|$|E

We found that populations of cells that exhibited high surface membrane binding affinity for Aβ also show higher membrane cholesterol levels compared to cells that did not bind Aβ. This direct relationship was upheld in cholesterol-enriched or cholesterol-depleted cell membranes. We conclude that the initial process for the cell-selective binding by Aβ, to later conversion of elemental Aβ units into larger structures such as fibrils or to the potentially <b>toxic</b> <b>ion</b> channel aggregates, is highly influenced by the membrane content of PtdSer and cholesterol in the cell surface membrane...|$|E
40|$|Major {{issues related}} to implant failure are wear debris and metal ions release where Titanium-Aluminium-Niobium alloys still face those {{problems}} despite of better biocompatibility. Surface modification {{is one of the}} alternatives in order to reduce those wear as well as ion release problems to the host tissue. In this study, experiments were carried out to investigate the element diffusion behaviour of Ti- 6 Al- 7 Nb alloy through thermal oxidation in order to obtain coating on the surfaces for diminishing those effects. Thermal oxidation was carried out at 650 °C for three different durations 6, 12 and 24 hours. It is found that at prolong time, Niobium diffusion occurs where short duration Aluminium dominates. This suggests that longer heating time promotes heavy metal diffusion by restricting diffusion of light metal and hence, dominates the heavy metal oxide layer formation. The oxide layer formed on the substrate may lead to increase the lifespan of the implant and reduces the harmful effects caused by wear debris or <b>toxic</b> <b>ion</b> from metal alloys...|$|E

30|$|Salt glands and {{bladders}} are {{the most}} remarkable organs found in some halophytes which arise from epidermal cells and are modified trichomes (Adams et al. 1998). These specialized organs are meant for secretion of <b>toxic</b> <b>ions</b> from the internal part of plant tissues. The salt glands also appear in the STGs that confers increased salinity tolerance in these plants. Salt glands are usually not found in non halophytes (Ramadan and Flowers 2004). Salt glands appear mostly in the mesophyll tissue of C 4 grasses. The efficiency of Na+ exclusion determines the salt tolerance of a particular species (Marcum 2006). Salt glands are generally bicelled in grasses. In Poaceae, bicellular salt glands are found commonly in the tribes: Chlorideae, Sporoboleae and Aeluropodeae (Liphschitz and Waisel 1974). Salt gland excretion in grasses is highly selective for <b>toxic</b> <b>ions</b> like Na+ and Cl- (Worku and Chapman 1998), although other ions like K+, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + may also be excreted in small amounts (Marcum and Murdoch 1994). The loading of <b>toxic</b> <b>ions</b> from the adjacent cells in to the salt gland is energy dependent (Naidoo and Naidoo 1999). Flowers et al. (1990) attributed the ability of maintaining a high K:Na ratio in the leaves to the secretion of <b>toxic</b> <b>ions</b> from the leaves. Most of the grass species, which are glycophyte in their habit, can tolerate high levels of salinity due {{to the presence of}} salt glands, and also the possession of salt glands suggests that they had a common halophytic ancestor (Liphschitz and Waisel 1974).|$|R

40|$|For grafted plants, salt stress {{tolerance}} of the aerial plant part is poorly documented. Thus, {{we developed a}} simple, fast and inexpensive method to identify tolerant genotypes. Twigs of 14 mandarin accessions that we previously analyzed as seedlings were cut in solution to prevent embolism and were then evaluated in salt stress condition for a week. Physiological parameters such as gas exchanges, leaf Cl− and Na+, {{as well as the}} presence of H 2 O 2 and the activity of enzymes involved in ROS synthesis and detoxification processes were analyzed. One accession known to be tolerant as rootstock was shown to be sensitive with limited Cl− translocation from the solution to the shoot while sensitive accessions when grown as seedlings presented limited wilting symptoms and accumulated large leaf Cl− content. A model is proposed to explain the different strategies of the plant to cope with high <b>toxic</b> <b>ion</b> content. This method allows separation of the root compartment, where ion exclusion mechanisms may exist and {{have an impact on the}} salt {{stress tolerance}} of the whole plant. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

Cr (VI) caused concentration dependent inhibition of protein, DNA and RNA synthesis in hepatocytes. GRd and to a lesser extent DT-diaphorase activities were involved in the generation of toxic intermediates. GRd activity was markedly inhibited during the reduction of Cr (VI), and GSH levels decreased. The concentrations of Cr (VI) found to inhibit macromolecular syntheses in this study are clinically relevant: it is therefore important to develop implants with minimum wear potential...|$|E

30|$|Tissue-specific {{compartmentalisation}} {{appears to}} play an important role in most of the grasses (Lessani and Marschner 1978; Taleisnik 1989; Bhatti et al. 1993), where the <b>toxic</b> <b>ions</b> like Na+ and Cl- are redistributed to the mature or senescing leaves and other organs. It is widely accepted that cell turgor is maintained by storage of Na+ and Cl- in vacuoles, with the solute potential of the cytosol adjusted by accumulation of K+ and organic solutes (Storey 1995). Evidence exists for the presence of K+/Na+ transporter channels across the tonoplast mediated by Na+/H+ antiport activity, resulting in compartmentation of <b>toxic</b> <b>ions</b> in the vacuoles (Jeschke 1984). Ideally in grasses, Na+ and Cl- are largely sequestered in the vacuole of the cell, this sequestering is indicated by the high concentrations of these ions in leaves that are still functioning normally mainly by osmotic adjustments (Marcum 1999).|$|R

Model water solutions were used to prepare ClO 4 - solutions (approximately, 1, 000 µg/L) {{in the presence of}} background salts (NaCl, Na 2 SO 4, and CaCl 2) at various pH values (3. 5, 7, and 9. 5) and solution ionic strengths (0. 001, 0. 01, and 0. 01 M NaCl) in the presence of natural organic matter (NOM). Rejection by the membranes increased with increasing solution pH owing to increasingly negative membrane charge. In addition, the rejection of the target ion by the membranes increased with increasing solution ionic strength. The rejection of ClO 4 - was consistently higher for the RO membrane than for the NF membrane and ClO 4 - rejection followed the order CaCl 2 < NaCl < Na 2 SO 4 at conditions of constant pH and ionic strength for both the RO and NF membranes.

We incorporated this finding into an investigation of two approaches to the conjunctive use of saline and non-saline water sources for sprinkler irrigation of potatoes viz., (i)  mixing waters prior to application, and (ii) keeping waters temporally separate, that is commencing each irrigation with saline water and finishing it with non-saline sprinkling. The latter approach delayed canopy senescence and increased tuber weight by at least 150 %. Under both approaches, soil salinities and leaf and tuber concentrations of Na+ and Cl− were similar.

40|$|Given that {{transition}} metals are essential cofactors in central biological processes, misallocation {{of the wrong}} metal ion to a metalloprotein can have resounding and often detrimental effects on diverse aspects of cellular physiology. Therefore, {{in an attempt to}} characterize unique and shared responses to chemically similar metals, we have reconstructed physiological behaviors of Halobacterium NRC- 1, an archaeal halophile, in sublethal levels of Mn(II), Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II). Over 20 % of all genes responded transiently within minutes of exposure to Fe(II), perhaps reflecting immediate large-scale physiological adjustments to maintain homeostasis. At steady state, each transition metal induced growth arrest, attempts to minimize oxidative stress, <b>toxic</b> <b>ion</b> scavenging, increased protein turnover and DNA repair, and modulation of active ion transport. While several of these constitute generalized stress responses, up-regulation of active efflux of Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II), down-regulation of Mn(II) uptake and up-regulation of Fe(II) chelation, confer resistance to the respective metals. We have synthesized all of these discoveries into a unified systems-level model to provide an integrated perspective of responses to six transition metals with emphasis on experimentally verified regulatory mechanisms. Finally, through comparisons across global transcriptional responses to different metals, we provide insights into putative in vivo metal selectivity of metalloregulatory proteins and demonstrate that a systems approach can help rapidly unravel novel metabolic potential and regulatory programs of poorly studied organisms...|$|E

Culture media were prepared by adding EDTA and Chelex- 100, separately or in combination, to disphotic zone water samples. Our proposed working hypothesis is that phytoplankton growth can be enhanced by removing <b>toxic</b> metal <b>ions</b> from culture media by Chelex- 100 and by detoxification of <b>toxic</b> metal <b>ions</b> or increasing the availability of essential metals by EDTA. A shortening of the lag period and an increase of the specific population growth rate were clearly observed after the addition of Chelex- 100 and EDTA.

The similar effects of removing <b>toxic</b> metal <b>ion</b> by Chelex- 100 as those of detoxification by EDTA suggested that EDTA has a role not only of detoxification but also of increasing the availability of essential metals.

Growth, gas exchange performances and ionic relations were evaluated. Ionic relations regarded both net ion fluxes and Na+ and Cl-concentrations in leaves of different age.

In contrast, both stomatal conductance (gs) and net CO 2 assimilation rate (A) were decreased by NaCl to a greater extent in GF 677 than in Mr. S. 2 / 5. Salt-induced decreases in net CO 2 assimilation rates were primarily due to stomatal limitations in both rootstocks. GF 677 showed a greater ability to limit the transport of Na+ (and Cl-) to the shoot and into the leaves, and this more efficient control of salt entry into the whole plant helped young leaves to be preserved from massive <b>toxic</b> <b>ion</b> accumulation.

Since constitutive cytokinin overproduction may have pleiotropic effects on plant development, two approaches assessed whether specific root-localized transgenic IPT (a key enzyme for cytokinin biosynthesis) gene expression could substantially improve tomato plant growth and yield under salinity: transient root IPT induction (HSP 70 ::IPT) and grafting wild-type (WT) shoots onto a constitutive IPT-expressing rootstock (WT/ 35 S::IPT). Transient root IPT induction increased root, xylem sap, and leaf bioactive cytokinin concentrations 2 - to 3 -fold without shoot IPT gene expression. Although IPT induction reduced root biomass (by 15 %) in control (non-salinized) plants, in salinized plants (100 ?mM NaCl for 22 ?d), increased cytokinin concentrations delayed stomatal closure and leaf senescence and almost doubled shoot growth (compared with WT plants), with concomitant increases in the essential nutrient K(+) (20 %) and decreases in the <b>toxic</b> <b>ion</b> Na(+) (by 30 %) and abscisic acid (by 20 - 40 %) concentrations in transpiring mature leaves.

30|$|Salt {{stress in}} soil {{generally}} involves osmotic stress and ion-induced injury, and Na+ {{is the main}} <b>toxic</b> <b>ion</b> in salinized soil. The extent of tolerance by plants to Na+ stress depends on at least three processes: compartmentalization (at cellular and/or tissue levels), exclusion (from roots into the rhizosphere) and transportation (in vasculatures) of the ions. In Arabidopsis, the salt overly sensitive protein 1 (SOS 1) functions in Na+ exclusion from root epidermal cells into the rhizosphere, which also {{plays a role in}} retrieving Na+ from the xylem stream under severe salt stress (Shi et al. 2002). The Ca 2 +-responsive AtSOS 3 –AtSOS 2 (AtCIPK 24 -AtCBL 4) protein kinase pathway mediates regulation of the expression and activities of Na+ transporters such as AtSOS 1 and AtNHX, a Na+/H+ exchanger that mediates Na+ compartmentalization into vacuoles (Zhu 2003). The rice SOS salt tolerance pathway has been identified and its functions have been shown as {{similar to that of the}} SOS pathway in Arabidopsis (Martínez-Atienza et al. 2007). In Arabidopsis and some other plant species, the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHX) family has been shown to function in Na+ compartmentalization into vacuoles (Munns and Tester 2008). In addition, some members of the high affinity K+ transporter (HKT) family, such as OsHKT 1; 5 and AtHKT 1; 1, mediate Na+ exclusion from shoots via Na+ removal from the xylem sap (Horie et al. 2009; Negrão et al. 2011).|$|E
25|$|The archetypal carnivore, the Venus flytrap, {{grows in}} soils with almost immeasurable nitrate and calcium levels. Plants need {{nitrogen}} for protein synthesis, calcium for cell wall stiffening, phosphate for nucleic acid synthesis, and iron for chlorophyll synthesis. The soil is often waterlogged, which favours {{the production of}} <b>toxic</b> <b>ions</b> such as ammonium, and its pH is an acidic 4 to 5. Ammonium {{can be used as}} a source of nitrogen by plants, but its high toxicity means that concentrations high enough to fertilise are also high enough to cause damage.|$|R
40|$|This paper tested if culturing {{the moss}} Scorpiurum circinatum (Brid.) Fleisch. & Loeske with metal {{solutions}} (Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn) for 30 days causes metal bioaccumulation and ultrastructural changes. The {{results showed that}} despite the high heavy metal concentrations in treatment solutions, treated samples did not show severe ultrastructural changes and cells were still alive and generally well preserved. Bioaccumulation highlighted that moss cells survived to heavy metal toxicity by immobilizing most <b>toxic</b> <b>ions</b> extracellularly, likely in binding sites of the cell wall, which is the main site of metal detoxification...|$|R
