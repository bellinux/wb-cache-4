5|$|Han Chinese power {{during the}} tumultuous post-Tang era was {{represented}} by the Song dynasty (9601279), which completed its unification of the Chinese states with the conquest of Wuyue in 971. Turning to the north after this victory, in 979 the Song eliminated the Northern Han, ultimate successors to the Later Jin, but were unable to take the Sixteen Prefectures from the Liao dynasty. As a result of Song's military aggression, relations between <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> <b>and</b> Liao remained tense and hostile. One of the battlegrounds in the Song–Liao War was the Great Wall Gap (長城口), so named because the southern Yan wall of the Warring States period crossed the Juma River here into Liao territory. The Great Wall Gap saw action in 979, 988989, and 1004, and a Song fortress was built there in 980. Intermittent wars between <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> <b>and</b> the Liao lasted until January 1005, when a truce was called {{and led to the}} Treaty of Chanyuan. This agreement, among other things, required the Song to pay tribute to the Liao, recognized <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> <b>and</b> Liao as equals, and demarcated the Song–Liao border, the course of which became more clearly defined in a series of subsequent bilateral agreements. Several stretches of the old Great Walls, including the Northern Qi Inner Wall near the Hengshan mountain range, became the border between <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> <b>and</b> the Liao.|$|E

5|$|After its release, Arista Records President Clive Davis found <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>and</b> wanted Melissa Manchester {{to record}} a cover; instead, {{he gave it to}} Deardorff & Joseph, a group that {{previously}} opened for Seals and Crofts, and they recorded it for their eponymous debut album.

5|$|At (4:30), {{the second}} of two prank calls begins, between Martin Bulloch and Colin Hardie, who have a {{conversation}} in which Bulloch plays a joke on Hardie, saying that Aitchison and Braithwaite had a disagreement, causing the former to punch the latter, and leave. Hardie, {{who was in a}} bookmakers {{at the time of the}} call, suggests that Bulloch and Paul Savage continue mixing <b>the</b> <b>song,</b> <b>and</b> says he will try to contact Braithwaite. This ends at (7:04), leaving the sound of ambient guitar noise to fade out and end the song.|$|E

5|$|Before {{principal}} photography began, Nargis and Raaj Kumar familiarised {{themselves with}} farming {{practices such as}} ploughing the fields, reaping and sowing, and cotton picking. The extras in <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>and</b> dance sequences of the film were from local dance groups in villages where the shooting took place {{instead of the usual}} ones from Mumbai.|$|E
5|$|By {{incorporating}} R infused beats in {{the music}} and not including her image on the cover artwork, marketing for the song {{gave the impression of}} Madonna as a black artist. That impression did not last long as Madonna would later convince Sire executives to shoot a music video for the song. The low-budget video directed by Ed Steinberg showed Madonna and her friends in a club singing and dancing to the song. The video helped to further promote <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>and</b> Madonna as an artist.|$|E
5|$|Changing {{technologies}} {{have affected the}} recording, distribution, and varying profitability of the underground industry.

5|$|For {{several days}} Frusciante and Kiedis worked on <b>the</b> <b>song,</b> <b>and</b> it {{became one of}} the few tracks written and {{completed}} prior to the band moving into The Mansion where they recorded the album. After the song was recorded, Rubin felt the grand and epic outro would benefit from a large group of singers. Frusciante invited his mother, Gail, and her friends, all of whom sang in a choir, to perform.|$|E
5|$|I had the chills. I had a {{great feeling}} about it when we {{finished}} writing <b>the</b> <b>song,</b> <b>and</b> I was flying back from Atlanta at some crazy hour of the morning...

5|$|I think it's {{something}} that is so unique about Rihanna whatever she's doing, whatever character she's playing, whatever side of herself she's showing, she's in it 1,000 percent... And I think <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>and</b> {{the theme of this}} song, she wanted to obviously show a softer side, a lighter side, one that's caught in maybe a tumultuous relationship... There's so much variety with her and it's been such a journey with her.|$|E
