5|$|Birds forage singly or {{in pairs}} in summer, {{and more often}} in larger flocks in autumn and winter, during which time {{they are more likely}} to loiter around people and urban areas. They {{occasionally}} associate with Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen) or common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) when foraging. Birds have also been encountered with grey currawongs (S.versicolor) and satin bowerbirds (Ptilinorhynchus violaceus). The species has been reported stealing food from other birds such as the Australian hobby (Falco longipennis), collared sparrowhawk (Accipiter cirrocephalus), and sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita). Pied currawongs will also harass each other. A 2007 study conducted by researchers from the Australian National University showed that white-browed scrubwren (Sericornis frontalis) nestlings became silent when <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> recorded sound of a pied currawong walking through leaf litter.|$|E
5|$|In Roman {{constitutional}} law, the assemblies are {{a sovereign}} authority, {{with the power}} to enact or reject any law, confer any magistracies, and make any decision. In fact, with a single law, they held the authority to override the norms and precedents of the Republic as well as ancient laws long unchanged. There are two necessary components to any assembly: (1) the convening magistrate and (2) the citizens in the assembly itself. Assemblies did not participate or discuss matters laid before them, <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> speakers put forth by the presiding officer. And after such discussion, the presiding officer could call for a direct up or down vote. Without a magistrate, there would be nobody to legally call upon the assembly; and without the citizens, there is naught but a magistrate.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the second day, June 23, the Committee on Permanent Organization {{announced}} the roster of officers, including the permanent president, John W. Stevenson of Kentucky. Before the delegates could formally elect Stevenson, <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> report on the Committee on Credentials. Two rival factions of Massachusetts Democrats had agreed to compromise, both being admitted as a united delegation. A similar dispute in New York was not resolved so easily: Tammany Hall and Tilden's Irving Hall had sent rival delegations as well, and neither was willing to compromise. The Committee had voted to consider the Irving Hall Democrats to have been regularly elected; Tammany was consequently excluded. Debate followed, in which some delegates urged compromise, with the idea that a united delegation would help unite the party in New York in the coming general election. The argument was unpersuasive, as the delegates endorsed the Committee's decision by a vote of 457 to 205½; Tammany was banished. Stevenson was then installed as permanent chairman and, as the Committee on Resolutions had not finished writing the platform, the delegates moved on to nominations.|$|E
5|$|Ibrox Park had {{the worst}} fan safety record in Britain before its {{complete}} redesign and renaming in 1997. Two fans died in September 1961 when a barrier collapsed on Stairway 13, resulting in a crush. Stairway 13 was a popular, often overcrowded, and very steep exit from the East Terracing due to its proximity to Copland Road subway station and parking areas for the Rangers supporters' coaches. After this incident, Rangers installed safety measures, but further injuries were sustained in crushes on Stairway 13 in both 1967 and 1969. On 23 October 1968, the main stand at Ibrox was hit by fire. Just seven months later there was another fire, which destroyed more than 200 seats behind the directors box. The worst disaster to yet affect football in Britain happened on Stairway 13 after the Old Firm game on 2 January 1971, when 66 people died of asphyxiation due to another crush on Stairway 13. The game itself ended in a 1–1 draw, with Colin Stein scoring a late equalising goal for Rangers. This led to a widespread belief that the crush had been caused by fans who had left the game early, but had turned back when <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> roar that greeted the Rangers goal. A public inquiry discounted this initial story. It established that the crowd had been travelling {{in the same direction}} when the crush happened, with it perhaps being precipitated by some bending over to pick up items that had been discarded during the goal celebrations. The downward force of the crowd leaving the stadium meant that when people started to fall there was no means of preventing a crush.|$|E

25|$|The {{crowd was}} large enough {{that most of}} the victims could not have known what was {{happening}} until it was too late; by the time <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> machine gun fire, there was no chance to escape.

25|$|At this point, {{many people}} {{indicated}} {{their desire to}} stop the experiment and check on the learner.

They had been under $2,500 bail each. The coroner's jury returned an open verdict that Hoey killed herself in the second floor bedroom.|$|E
25|$|Navigation {{using the}} Orfordness Beacon was quite simple. Navigators simply tuned {{in the station}} on their radios {{and waited for the}} V signal to be broadcast. They noted the time of the V and counted off the seconds until <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> null. This could be {{simplified}} {{with the use of a}} stopwatch. The time in seconds between the ending of the V and hearing the null was then multiplied by 6 to produce the angle from the station to the receiver.|$|E
25|$|The {{first to}} arrive on the scene were nurses and doctors from nearby Bucur Maternity Hospital, who were on duty that Friday night. <b>They</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> screams of the injured {{and went out to}} the street in robes and {{slippers}} to provide first aid. The first 112 call came at 10:32p.m., and the first emergency service arrived 11 minutes after the call. The State Secretary at the Ministry of Health, Raed Arafat, and deputy Prime Minister Gabriel Oprea arrived at the scene late in the night.|$|E

25|$|Presiding {{over the}} pre-conclave events was the Dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Ratzinger.

On 14 April, {{in one of the}} daily general congregations, <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> first of two mandated exhortations. The preacher was Raniero Cantalamessa, a Capuchin friar and Church history scholar, who had for several years preached the Lenten sermons to the Pope and his staff.|$|E
25|$|The {{crew and}} {{passengers}} took refuge in the rigging, but {{one by one the}} masts broke and went over the side and the men were hurled into the breakers.

25|$|The {{others had}} not moved much further when <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> shots ring out. A {{raid on the}} shop had been planned, and Tracy had arrived just before the {{soldiers}}.

Tracy, along with two civilians, was killed in the incident. McKee only narrowly avoided capture, by escaping on a bicycle during the confusion {{at the time of the}} shooting.|$|E

Those troops were approaching Little Bethel in front of the site of the incident. The Union forces had lost the element of surprise for their attack and delayed the timing of it as well.|$|E
25|$|Many Parisians presumed Louis' {{actions to}} be aimed against the Assembly and began open {{rebellion}} when <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> news the next day. They were also afraid that arriving soldiers – mostly foreign mercenaries – had been summoned {{to shut down}} the National Constituent Assembly. The Assembly, meeting at Versailles, went into nonstop session to prevent another eviction from their meeting place. Paris was soon consumed by riots, chaos, and widespread looting. The mobs soon had the support of some of the French Guard, who were armed and trained soldiers.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Broughton returned, about 25 minutes later, Bessie Smith was in shock. Time passed {{with no sign}} of the ambulance, so Hugh Smith {{suggested}} that they take her into Clarksdale in his car. He and Broughton had almost finished clearing the back seat when <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> sound of a car approaching at high speed. Smith flashed his lights in warning, but the oncoming car failed to stop and plowed into his car at full speed. It sent his car careening into Bessie Smith's overturned Packard, completely wrecking it. The oncoming car ricocheted off Hugh Smith's car into the ditch on the right, barely missing Broughton and Bessie Smith.|$|E
