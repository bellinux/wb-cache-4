5|$|In 1967, {{he became}} the head coach for Princeton University's men's ice hockey team, a {{position}} he would hold for six seasons. His best season was his first in 1967–68, when the Tigers posted a 13–10–0 record. It was the highest win total for Princeton since 1935–36. However, his success with the men's ice hockey team would not last; Princeton won {{no more than five}} games for their next five seasons. His worst campaign was in 1970–71, when Princeton had two 11 game losing streaks and a 1–22–0 overall record. Because of this, Quackenbush stepped down as the head coach in 1973. In 1969 he began coaching the Princeton men's golf team. He enjoyed much greater success with the golf team, leading them to eight Ivy League championships. In 1978 Princeton started a women's ice hockey team, and Quackenbush was asked to coach them.
