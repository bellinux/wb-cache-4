5|$|Although Brabham bought Cosworth DFV engines for the 1969 season, Rindt left to join Lotus. His replacement, Jacky Ickx, had {{a strong}} second half to the season, winning in Germany and Canada, after Brabham was sidelined by a testing accident. Ickx {{finished}} second in the Drivers' Championship, with 37points to Jackie Stewart's 63. Brabham himself <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of pole positions and two top-3 finishes, but did not finish half the races. The team were second in the Constructors' Championship, aided by second places at Monaco and Watkins Glen scored by Piers Courage, driving a Brabham for the Frank Williams Racing Cars privateer squad.|$|E
5|$|The island {{they arrived}} on {{turned out to}} be {{uninhabited}} with little food and no apparent water. After a camp had been set up ashore, White was sent back to the still floating Grasshopper to scavenge supplies. He boarded the vessel and descended below decks to search for any items that might be of use. Whilst there, he felt Judy in the darkness, pinned in her bed under a row of lockers. He constructed a raft out of materials on the Grasshopper and rowed the items, along with Judy, back to the island. The lack of water was becoming an issue, until Judy began to dig at a point on the waterline. It <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of minutes, but Judy managed to unearth a fresh-water spring and was credited with saving everyone's lives. During the first night, the magazine on the Grasshopper finally caught light and exploded, sinking the vessel. The survivors continued to camp on the beach for the following few days, with Judy protecting them from snakes.|$|E

25|$|In frustration, Ryan forced Mitchinson to back off, {{then got}} out of the passenger's side door and noticed Walker running towards him, being chased by Hodson who was holding the pipe in his hand. Walker was {{shouting}} frantically to Ryan that prison guard William Bennett, standing on the Number 2 prison tower, had his rifle aimed at them. At this time, Hodson was chasing Walker, Ryan <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of steps forward and raised his rifle and aimed it at Hodson.|$|E
25|$|Waugh {{could not}} {{break into the}} South Australian Sheffield Shield team but did take part in their 1998/99 Mercantile Mutual cup campaign. The second of his two games, and his last ever {{appearance}} in Australian domestic cricket, was another Semi Final loss. On this occasion it was Victoria who eliminated his team from the competition. After scoring 17 of South Australia's total of 175, he <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of catches during Victoria's pursuit of their target before the winning runs were hit with just nine balls to spare.|$|E
25|$|Warspite {{spent three}} years between 1807 and 1810 playing a {{supporting}} role in the Peninsular War. She {{took part in the}} long blockade of Toulon in 1810. She then joined the Channel Fleet, protecting British trade while intercepting French and American ships. During early 1813 Warspite <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of lucrative ‘prizes’ including a US schooner bound for Philadelphia ‘with brandy, wine, silks, etc.,’ from France. In June 1814 her name appears {{for the first time on}} the North American and West Indies Station, when she carried reinforcements to Quebec; the first 74-gun ship to go so far up the Saint Lawrence River, under Captain Lord James O'Brien.|$|E

25|$|The {{action at}} Werl had been {{preceded by a}} general plundering of Vest and Recklinghausen by troops of Hermann Friedrich Cloedt and Martin Schenck which alienated the farmers and merchants of Westphalia from Gebhard's cause, {{although}} not specifically from Protestantism. Schenck used trickery to take the fortress at Werl, but {{was not able to}} completely overpower the guard. The arrival of a superior force outnumbering his by about 10 to 1, under the command of Claude de Berlaymont, cornered him in within the city's walls. In his subsequent withdrawal, he <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> dozen civilian hostages, and escaped with his booty across the Rhine river.|$|E
25|$|In/Casino/Out was {{released}} on August 18, 1998, although the band toured almost non-stop from July until December, playing shows with bands like Knapsack and The Murder City Devils. At the Drive-In <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> month break until March 1999, at which point they kicked off another tour with a two-week stint with Jimmy Eat World in the United States until they headed to Europe for a six-week European tour spanning eleven countries. Upon returning to the United States, At the Drive-In played a handful of shows {{before returning to the}} studio to record their fourth EP entitled Vaya, which {{was released}} on July 13, 1999. Without missing a beat, the band kicked off another tour on July 28 at Emo's in Austin, Texas with El Paso band Universal Recovered and Austin band Schatzi opening this show. This tour included shows with bands like The Get Up Kids and Rage Against the Machine. Later, in April 2000, At the Drive-In released a split EP with the Czech band Sunshine, containing five songs, two of them by At the Drive-In.|$|E
25|$|Denton has had {{a career}} {{hampered}} by injuries. When fit he can be destructive, as shown by when he dismissed Stuart Law, Allan Border and Jimmy Maher {{in the space of}} six deliveries on debut in the 1994-95 summer. He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of years off before returning in 1998-99 for Tasmania and earning Australia A selection. Stress fractures would set him back both in 1999-2000 and 2000-01. He recovered and reappeared in 2001-02 and after a couple of decent seasons he was back to his best in 2003-04, taking 30 wickets at 33.13. He moved to Victoria the following summer but did not get much game time due to hip and foot injuries. His only appearance for the Bushrangers was an ING Cup game. In 2005-06 he made the headlines by breaking one of Justin Langer's ribs which cost the opener a Test place. It would be another painful season for Denton as he suffered from appendicitis late in the summer which meant that he could not line up in the Pura Cup final. He still finished Victoria's leading wicket taker with 33 at 28.15 from his eight matches.|$|E

They returned a verdict that Webster was not [...] "quick with child", though this did not necessarily mean that she was not pregnant– a distinction that led the president of the Obstetrical Society of London to protest at the use of [...] "the obsolete medical assumption that the unborn child is not alive until the so-called 'quickening.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Beneath a Steel Sky was {{published}} in March 1994 by Virgin Interactive on floppy disks and CD-ROM. It came on 15 floppy disks, as opposed to Lure of The Temptress, which came on four. Because of the Amiga restrictions, a few animations had to be left out, as not all Amiga owners had a hard drive. Each conversion of the images to the Amiga resulted {{in a loss of}} detail because of the Amiga's limited palette and resolution. According to Revolution in-house artist Adam Tween, it <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of days to [...] "touch up" [...] the screens.

And the second stuff we shot in a big huge tank where we filmed all the underwater sequence, that was in a 93° pool," [...] Landes clarified. Cook and Landes performed their own stunts in both sequences. [...] "My biggest fear is being trapped in a car underwater. So it was kind of cool to face my fear and all that," [...] Cook divulged.

500|$|Though interested, yet {{frustrated}} {{about the}} writing style {{and not knowing}} {{what is going to}} happen next, upon starting, Armitage was told by co-star Peter Firth to learn to run with it, as well as learn the lines and political jargon quickly.

500|$|By {{the time}} {{she went back to}} {{mountain}} biking after the Commonwealth Games to defend her national title, Lynch had already missed the first two of the six rounds. As the four best results counted towards the title, {{there was no room for}} error. Lynch was in top form, won the remaining four national series races, and retained her title. With this accomplished, Braggins and Lynch travelled to the United States to prepare for the inaugural UCI Mountain Bike World Championships in 1990; prior to this, there were two separate events run by NORBA in the USA, and by Grundig in Europe. At the final NORBA race, Lynch crashed badly. She <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of Aspirin, unaware that she was allergic to the drug. Just before the UCI World Championship race, Lynch needed hospital treatment for internal bleeding caused by her pain medication. She still competed, coming a [...] "disappointing" [...] tenth place in the cross country race after having hoped for a higher finish.|$|E
500|$|After the Beatles' break-up, the two collaborated musically {{and formed}} Wings in 1971. They faced derision from some fans and critics, who {{questioned}} her inclusion. She {{was nervous about}} performing with Paul, who explained, [...] "she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy." [...] Paul defended her musical ability: [...] "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard... She <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of lessons and learned some bluesy things... she did very well and made it look easier than it was... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a Minimoog, which could only be played with one finger. It was monophonic." [...] He went on to say, [...] "We thought we were {{in it for the}} fun... it was just something we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves." [...] Former Wings guitarist McCullough said of collaborating with Linda, [...] "trying to get things together with a learner in the group didn't work as far as I was concerned." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{season was}} {{critically}} acclaimed and remains popular among the show's fanbase. In 2003, Entertainment Weekly published {{a list of}} its 25 favorite episodes and placed [...] "Homer at the Bat", [...] "Flaming Moe's" [...] and [...] "Radio Bart" [...] at 15th, 16th and 20th positions, respectively.

IGN would later name [...] "Flaming Moe's" [...] the best episode of the third season. Chris Turner, {{the author of the book}} Planet Simpson, believes that the third season marks the beginning of [...] "the Golden Age" [...] of The Simpsons and pinpoints [...] "Homer at the Bat" [...] as the first episode of the era.

[...] She added, [...] "I came back and revisited it so that it could be what it is now So it actually <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of times, but every time, the energy was just so high." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly felt that the singer who sings the song's hook has a [...] "crucial role", believing that [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] is a [...] "smash that concert attendees expect Jay to play, and it just wouldn't work without a big, clear voice to sing that hook". In November 2012, Keys said she had to redo the vocals after Jay-Z said he wasn't happy with her original take.

500|$|On September 12, {{the explorers}} {{resigned}} themselves to wintering {{on the ice}} and camped on a large floe, letting the ice take them where it would, [...] "which", writes Kjellström, [...] "it had really been doing all along" [...] (p.47). Drifting rapidly due south towards Kvitøya, they hurriedly built a winter [...] "home" [...] on the floe against the increasing cold, with walls made of water-reinforced snow to Strindberg's design (see plan, below, left). Observing the rapidity of their drift, Andrée recorded his hopes that they might get far enough south to feed themselves entirely from the sea. However, the floe began to break up directly under the hut on October 2 from the stresses of pressing against Kvitøya, and they were forced to bring their stores on to the island itself, which <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of days.
