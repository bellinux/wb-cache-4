2500|$|On 8 September 2010, eight stamps of {{the seventh}} {{definitive}} stamp series, entitled [...] "Irish Animals and Marine Life", were issued at launch. They photographically illustrate Ireland’s biodiversity. Issued in [...] "Stamps on a Roll" [...] self-adhesive strips, the stamps feature the following wildlife: <b>tompot</b> <b>blenny,</b> green tiger beetle, red squirrel, golden eagle, common octopus, hermit crab, sea slug and bottlenose dolphin.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tompot</b> <b>blenny</b> (Parablennius gattorugine) is a {{medium-sized}} blenny growing to about 30 cm, {{part of the}} large family of blennies that live on the seabed of rocky areas in shallow water (down to 20 m). The <b>tompot</b> <b>blenny</b> is found on the northern, western and southern coasts of Great Britain and is unusual on the east coast, {{although it has been}} seen on wrecks off the North Norfolk coast. The species is also present in mainland Portugal, in the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmora, and around the Azores and Madeira. The fish are very inquisitive and are often seen by scuba divers.|$|E
50|$|The giant Caribbean {{sea anemone}} is a macrophagous {{carnivore}} and feeds upon fish, mussels, shrimp, zooplankton, and sea worms. It will not, however, go near any natural predators, such as red leg hermits, the grey sea slug, or the <b>tompot</b> <b>blenny.</b>|$|E

5000|$|After Sarah ended, Haynes {{established}} Shinkansen Recordings in 1996. Named {{after the}} Japanese [...] "bullet train", the label was originally {{going to be}} called [...] "Metropolitan", but there was already a record label of that name. Shinkansen released new recordings by ex-Sarah artists (including Blueboy and Harvey Williams) as well as other acts including Fosca, Trembling Blue Stars and <b>Tompot</b> <b>Blenny.</b> Haynes went on to edit a zine, Smoke: a London Peculiar, dedicated to writing and art inspired by London.|$|E
50|$|In Sturla {{there is}} a Site of Community Importance, as was {{proposed}} by the Natura 2000 network of Liguria, for its particular nature and geology. The site is located between Boccadasse, Sturla, Quarto dei Mille, Quinto al Mare and Nervi. It has a very particular habitat formed by Posidonia oceanica (commonly known as Neptune Grass or Mediterranean Tapeweed) and coral formations. Among the animal species are the following fish: tentacled blenny, <b>tompot</b> <b>blenny,</b> seahorse, gray wrasse, brown wrasse, pointed-snout wrasse, east Atlantic peacock wrasse.|$|E
5000|$|The Worthing Lumps are a {{range of}} {{underwater}} chalk cliffs about 5 mi off the Worthing coast. [...] They face north, rise as high as 10 ft and have areas of small rocks and sand at their base. [...] They have been designated a Marine Site of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCI), and are an important breeding and visiting ground for sea creatures such as lesser spotted dogfish, <b>tompot</b> <b>blenny,</b> gobies, triggerfish and piddocks, and for birds such as the red-breasted merganser. [...] There are few undersea chalk cliffs in the waters around Britain: Sussex has several, and the Lumps {{have been described as}} the best example.|$|E
40|$|We {{present for}} the first time evidences of {{predation}} on black, ink-stained eggs of the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis. Observations were carried out in the Ría de Vigo (NW Spain) at a depth of 10 m, in late April 2010. The behavior was photographed. The predator was a <b>Tompot</b> <b>blenny</b> Parablennius gattorugine. The fish attacked a cuttlefish egg mass laid on a Podweed (Halydris siliquosa). Cuttlefish embryos were in a late stage of development. The blenny behavior is described. How the fish was able to discover potential prey items in the egg capsules is discussed. We suggest that cuttlefish embryos at late developmental stages are also able to recognize potential predators during the perinatal period and avoid them after hatchling. Peer reviewe...|$|E
