5|$|Although the {{watertight}} bulkheads extended {{well above}} the water line, they were not sealed at the top. If too many compartments were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and water would spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather like water spilling across the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ice cube tray. This was what happened to Titanic, which had suffered damage to the forepeak tank, the three forward holds and No.6 boiler room, {{a total of five}} compartments. Titanic was only designed to float with any two compartments flooded, but it could remain afloat with certain combinations of three or even four compartments (the first four) open to the ocean. With five compartments, the tops of the bulkheads would be submerged and the ship would continue to flood.|$|E
5|$|Between 1954 and 1962, {{most of the}} {{buildings}} that had been constructed around the tower over the years, including the parliamentary legal offices, a stable, a row of houses and the Prime Minister's chauffeur's house, were demolished, and a new garden, College Green, was laid out beside the tower, on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> underground parking lot. The medieval moat was re-excavated in 1956, and filled with water between 1963 and the 1990s, when its poor water quality led to its being drained and lined with gravel.|$|E
5|$|Building 28 (Structure 5D-28) is {{an unusual}} {{building}} at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> access stairway {{on the east side}} of the basal platform. It appears to have been a guardroom controlling access from the east terrace. The chamber originally contained curtained doorways and benches against the walls. The width of the building completely blocked access from the stairway; this forced visitors to pass through the chamber, where their presence could be scrutinised and passage beyond blocked if necessary. This route may have become important when Temple 33 was built, blocking the main access stairway from the Great Plaza. Structure 5D-28 was built very late in the Early Classic period (around the 6th century).|$|E

5|$|Platform B5 {{possesses}} two stepped {{levels with}} cornices and encloses {{the northern part}} of the west side of the Group B plaza. The lower level possesses a single inset stairway, while the upper terrace has two stairways flanked by balustrades, with a third balustrade dividing the two. The platform provides a broad view across the Pancaco River valley to the west. Structure B5 was built on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> earlier construction phase, which is exposed along the upper portion of the back wall because restoration of the building only rebuilt the lower portion. It was built from stone slabs and was originally taller than the final version of the platform but was cut back to the reduced height of the new building.|$|E
5|$|Scenes not {{involving}} the main apartments were all filmed in London {{during the week}} beginning March 30, 1998. Location shooting was done mostly for scenes featuring Joey and Chandler; outside the London Marriott, Grosvenor Square, and the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> open-top London bus as it crosses Tower Bridge (this scene was excised from the final cut but features in the opening titles of the next episode). Interiors, such as the restaurant, the Waltham's hallway and the hotel rooms, were all filmed on purpose-built sets at The Fountain Studios, Wembley. The reaction from the audience when Monica came out from under Chandler's bed covers meant the actors had to hold their position for 27 seconds. When filming ran late one evening, the production team ordered pizzas for the audience.|$|E

5|$|Although most white dwarfs {{are thought}} to be {{composed}} of carbon and oxygen, spectroscopy typically shows that their emitted light comes from an atmosphere which is observed to be either hydrogen or helium dominated. The dominant element is usually at least 1,000 times more abundant than all other elements. As explained by Schatzman in the 1940s, the high surface gravity is thought to cause this purity by gravitationally separating the atmosphere so that heavy elements are below and the lighter above., §5–6 This atmosphere, {{the only part of the}} white dwarf visible to us, is thought to be the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> envelope which is a residue of the star's envelope in the AGB phase and may also contain material accreted from the interstellar medium. The envelope is believed to consist of a helium-rich layer with mass no more than 1/100 of the star's total mass, which, if the atmosphere is hydrogen-dominated, is overlain by a hydrogen-rich layer with mass approximately 1/10,000 of the stars total mass., §4–5.|$|E
5|$|Birdy was {{the first}} feature film to be {{partially}} shot with the Skycam, a computer-controlled, cable-suspended camera system created by Garrett Brown, inventor of the Steadicam. The Skycam had 100-foot high posts with four hanging wires controlled by a computer, and a lightweight Panavision camera with 200 feet of film hung {{at the center of}} the wires. The filmmakers intended to use the Skycam to fully depict Birdy's point of view during a fantasy sequence in which he imagines himself flying. However, they encountered difficulties with the Skycam, which would often malfunction. Although the Skycam proved successful on its first take, Parker insisted that the filmed footage be shot more rapidly. However, the camera system malfunctioned during its second take, after capturing 40 seconds of footage. This resulted in the camera operators shooting the remainder of the sequence with a Steadicam mounted on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> improvised camera dolly.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2008, the CTA {{board was}} {{scheduled}} to hear the city's plan of a three-phase bailout {{of the construction of}} the rapid transit station under block 37. The plan included $20million in additional tax increment financing. This comes on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extra $60–70million in excess of its budgeted amount that the CTA has been forces to expend. The building developer, Joseph Freed & Associates, has agreed to accept $19million of cost overruns. This round of assistance only covers costs that have been incurred to date. No further funds have been committed and the station's development is being halted until such funds arise. The original budget was $213million ($173 from CTA) and costs to date have been $320million. As of last year the costs were $150million over budget and the city is seeking private investment. Construction finally began on the third building, the hotel and residences in the end of 2009.|$|E

5|$|The Capitoline Temple {{stands behind}} the {{basilica}} within what would originally {{have been an}} arcaded courtyard. An altar stands in the courtyard in front of 13 steps {{leading up to the}} Corinthian-columned temple, which had a single cella. The building was of great importance to civic life as it was dedicated to the three chief divinities of the Roman state, Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. Civic assemblies were held in front of the temple to beseech the aid of the gods or to thank them for successes in major civic undertakings such as fighting wars. The layout of the temple, facing the back wall of the basilica, is somewhat unusual and {{it has been suggested that}} it may have been built on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> existing shrine. An inscription found in 1924 records that it was reconstructed in 218. It was partly restored in 1955 and given a more substantial restoration in 1962, reconstructing 10 of the 13 steps, the walls of the cella and the columns. There were four more small shrines within the temple precinct, one of which was dedicated to Venus.|$|E
5|$|The {{festivals and}} daily rituals do not adhere to {{standard}} Hindu Agamic or Buddhist rituals. It follows what Paul Younger calls as ancient Vedda traditions of worship. Although since the medieval period Hindus, Buddhists and even Muslims {{have tried to}} co-opt the temple, deity and its worship as their own, the rituals maintained by the native priests are still intact. The main festival known in Sinhalese as Esela Perehera. It is celebrated during the months of July and August. About 45 days before the festival begins, the priests go into the forest and find two forked branches of a sacred tree. The branches are then immersed in the local river and kept at the shrines dedicated to Kataragama deviyo and Vali. When the main festival begins, the Yantra representing the deity is retrieved from its storage location, paraded through a street on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> elephant, and carried to the Valli shrine. After two hours it is returned. On {{the last day of}} the festival the Yantra is left overnight at the Valli shrine and brought back to the main shrine. The priests conduct the rituals in silence, covering their mouths with white cloth. Associated with the main festival is fire walking arranged by a master of the ritual. Hundreds of devotees participate in fire walking, yet others participate in ecstatic dance forms called Kavadi and body piercing. Many of the pilgrims exhibit signs of being possessed.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU1) was {{released to the public}} on October2, 2006, delivering a 20-30X speedup for some calculations over its CPU-based GROMACS counterparts. It was the first time GPUs had been used for either distributed computing or major molecular dynamics calculations. GPU1 gave researchers significant knowledge and experience with the development of GPGPU software, but in response to scientific inaccuracies with DirectX, on April10, 2008 it was succeeded by GPU2, the second generation of the client. Following the introduction of GPU2, GPU1 was officially retired on June6. Compared to GPU1, GPU2 was more scientifically reliable and productive, ran on ATI and CUDA-enabled Nvidia GPUs, and supported more advanced algorithms, larger proteins, and real-time visualization of the protein simulation. Following this, the third generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU3) was released on May25, 2010. While backward compatible with GPU2, GPU3 was more stable, efficient, and flexibile in its scientific abilities, and used OpenMM on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> OpenCL framework. Although these GPU3 clients did not natively support the operating systems Linux and macOS, Linux users with Nvidia graphics cards were able to run them through the Wine software application. GPUs remain Folding@home's most powerful platform in FLOPS. As of November 2012, GPU clients account for 87% of the entire project's x86 FLOPS throughput.|$|E
