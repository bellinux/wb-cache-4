5|$|The Galileo craft made six close flybys of Ganymede from 1995–2000 (G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29) and {{discovered}} that Ganymede has a permanent (intrinsic) magnetic moment independent of the Jovian magnetic field. The value of <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> about , which is three {{times larger than the}} magnetic moment of Mercury. The magnetic dipole is tilted with respect to the rotational axis of Ganymede by 176°, which means that it is directed against the Jovian magnetic moment. Its north pole lies below the orbital plane. The dipole magnetic field created by this permanent moment has a strength of 719 ± 2 nT at Ganymede's equator, which should be compared with the Jovian magnetic field at the distance of Ganymede—about 120 nT. The equatorial field of Ganymede is directed against the Jovian field, meaning reconnection is possible. The intrinsic field strength at the poles is two times that at the equator—1440 nT.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{statistical}} approaches for unsupervised learning <b>is</b> <b>the</b> method of <b>moments.</b> In <b>the</b> method of <b>moments,</b> <b>the</b> unknown parameters (of interest) in the model <b>are</b> related to <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> {{of one or more}} random variables, and thus, these unknown parameters can <b>be</b> estimated given <b>the</b> <b>moments.</b> <b>The</b> <b>moments</b> <b>are</b> usually estimated from samples empirically. <b>The</b> basic <b>moments</b> <b>are</b> first and second order moments.

25|$|More monumental {{than the}} three panels that preceded it, the two figures {{dominate}} the foreground of Eight Bells, {{and the details}} of the ship are minimally rendered. Homer has taken some artistic license, showing the figure at left using an octant to take a reading of the sun, the other apparently reading the altitude of a completed sight on his octant. In reality, both observers would have had their octants to their eyes, rocking them back and forth to determine the highest elevation reached by the sun, thereby establishing local apparent noon. <b>The</b> <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> prosaic, yet it is presented as a heroic image. In 1887 Homer produced an etching based on the painting, in which he further minimized the ship's rigging and diminished the area of sky, thereby focusing more on the figures.|$|E
25|$|In {{the midst}} of the Time War between the Time Lords and the Daleks, the War Doctor — a hitherto-unknown {{incarnation}} of the Doctor — decides to trigger an ancient weapon called The Moment in order to destroy both sides completely. <b>The</b> <b>Moment</b> <b>is</b> sentient and manifests itself as Rose Tyler. It questions whether mass killing is the best option for ending the Time War and prescribes the Doctor's punishment if he does so — he will survive while the rest of his race dies. The Moment offers to show the Doctor what this will turn him into and opens a fissure linking him to the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors. The three Doctors converge in the year 1562, where the Tenth Doctor has been tracking down a Zygon. They discover that the Zygon is disguised as Queen Elizabeth, who captures and imprisons them in the Tower of London.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, a <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> a {{specific}} quantitative measure, {{used in both}} mechanics and statistics, of {{the shape of a}} set of points.

25|$|The channel has {{sometimes}} been judged, increasingly in more recent years, to have moved away from this original role and to have {{moved closer to the}} mainstream. Since the launch of the digital-only BBC Four, the BBC has been accused in particular of shifting its more highbrow output to the new channel, which, {{until the end of the}} UK's digital TV switchover in October 2012, a minority (7.5% in the final quarter of 2010) of viewers did not receive. BBC Four's remit is very similar to that of the earlier remit of BBC2, and contains many documentaries and arts programmes. It has been perceived by some that this strategy is to allow BBC Two to show more popular programmes and to secure higher ratings. Since 2004 there have been some signs of an attempt to return closer to parts of BBC Two's earlier output with the arts strand The Culture Show. Its most popular programme at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> Top Gear.|$|E

500|$|The {{paintings}} were composed within {{several years of}} Alexander coming to power. His father and predecessor, King Milan, was so unpopular {{that he had to}} abdicate his throne. Alexander's reign was marked by protracted political instability, culminating in the coup d'état that resulted in his death. The art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson believes The Takovo Uprising was composed in response to the chaotic political climate. She writes: [...] The painting, she asserts, was to serve as [...] "a reminder of Serb achievements during and after the Second Uprising, and of the leadership that made those successes possible." [...] Jovanović's positioning Obrenović slightly left of centre ensures that he fully dominates the scene. [...] "The brown soil and gravestones of the churchyard," [...] Filipovitch-Robinson writes, [...] "stand as reminders of the transitory nature of physical life". The political scientist Anamaria Segesten suggests that the portrayal of Obrenović wearing Turkish clothing, particularly a turban, might be a reference to his collaboration with the Ottomans prior to the uprising, and his adoption of Ottoman customs while staying in Istanbul. She notes that half the people gathered around Obrenović are also wearing Turkish clothes, signifying that while they might temporarily have professed loyalty to the Ottoman sultan, they are actually patriots willing to rise up and fight for the Serbian cause when <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> right.
