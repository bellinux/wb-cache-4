25|$|A 2008 study {{wanted to}} find out if there was any {{correlation}} between sexual content shown in the media and teenage pregnancy. Research showed that <b>teens</b> <b>who</b> viewed high levels of sexual content were twice as likely to get pregnant within three years compared to those <b>teens</b> <b>who</b> were not exposed to as much sexual content. The study concluded that the way media portrays sex has a huge effect on adolescent sexuality.|$|E

25|$|Family life or sex {{education}} in the public schools, which traditionally has consisted largely of providing factual information at the secondary school level, is the most general or pervasive approach to preventing pregnancy among adolescents.... Adolescents who begin having sexual intercourse {{need to understand the}} importance of using an effective contraceptive every time they have sex. This requires convincing sexually active <b>teens</b> <b>who</b> have never used contraception to do so. In addition, sexually active <b>teens</b> <b>who</b> sometimes use contraceptives need to use them more consistently (every time they have sex) and use them correctly.|$|E

25|$|In late 2009, {{reports were}} {{released}} by the London-based human-rights group Plan International, claiming that child labor was common on Malawi (producer of 1.8% of the world's tobacco) tobacco farms. The organization interviewed 44 <b>teens,</b> <b>who</b> worked full-time on farms during the 2007-8 growing season. The child-laborers complained of low pay and long hours, {{as well as physical}} and sexual abuse by their supervisors. They also reported suffering from Green tobacco sickness, a form of nicotine poisoning. When wet leaves are handled, nicotine from the leaves gets absorbed in the skin and causes nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Children were exposed to 50-cigarettes-worth of nicotine through direct contact with tobacco leaves. This level of nicotine in children can permanently alter brain structure and function.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} violent {{encounters}} and tragedies have sparked growing concern, raising doubts {{on the ability}} of the TDSB to provide a safe educational environment. Stakeholders believe that the TDSB is failing on their promise of a harmonious learning environment for Toronto’s youth. The Toronto District School Board location is known for having a high rate of violence among youths. The year 2013 saw the highest number of youths killed by guns in the district of Toronto including 7 <b>teens</b> <b>who</b> were 16 {{years old at the time}} of the incidents.

25|$|Second season casting {{opened on}} June 5, 2009, and closed on July 10, 2009.

Participants were selected for the show, in part, based on their strong personalities. The final eight participants were told in early September 2009 that they were selected for the show. The eight <b>teens</b> <b>who</b> appear in the second season were required to sign a confidentiality agreement prior to the commencement of filming.

25|$|Ingesting a {{compound}} by smoking {{is one of}} the most rapid and efficient methods of introducing it into the bloodstream, second only to injection, which allows for the rapid feedback which supports the smokers' ability to titrate their dosage. On average it takes about ten seconds for the substance to reach the brain. As a result of the efficiency of this delivery system, many smokers feel as though they are unable to cease. Of those who attempt cessation and last three months without succumbing to nicotine, most are able to remain smoke-free for the rest of their lives. There exists a possibility of depression in some who attempt cessation, as with other psychoactive substances. Depression is also common in teenage smokers; <b>teens</b> <b>who</b> smoke are four times as likely to develop depressive symptoms as their nonsmoking peers.|$|E

25|$|Alexander Parks {{and others}} have {{identified}} libraries as potentially important safe places for LGBTQ youth and teens, especially {{in the face of}} bullying. He suggests the inclusion of LGBTQ titles in library displays or book talks to promote greater visibility. However, according to an 2005 study by Ann Curry, though many LGBTQ teens have the very similar concerns to their adult counterparts, librarians often do not answer their questions related to LGBTQ topics in a sensitive or welcoming manner. Studies by Carmichael and Greenblatt have emphasized that the library is an important place for <b>teens</b> <b>who</b> are coming out to find information because of the potential anonymity it provides. In his examination of public libraries in areas with large concentrations of same-sex families, Naidoo finds that many children's librarians are unaware of the LGBTQ families in their community and provide a mixed-bag of services, collections, and programs.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} later added as a video {{interlude}} on The MDNA Tour in 2012, {{as a tribute}} to Tyler Clementi and other <b>teens</b> <b>who</b> had committed suicide due to bullying. The film, which was created by Swedish director Johan Söderberg, morphed Madonna's face with a number of famous figures, including then-Chinese President Hu Jintao, US Republican former presidential candidate Sarah Palin and Pope Benedict XVI. The face of French far right politician Marine Le Pen appeared on the screen with a swastika superimposed on her forehead, before it morphed into the face of Adolf Hitler. Le Pen was infuriated by the video, and threatened to sue Madonna should this happen during her concert in France on July 14, 2012, also known as Bastille Day, the French National Day. Socialist French government spokesperson Najat Vallaud-Belkacem had also expressed her disappointment. However, Madonna kept the video unchanged on this date, prompting Le Pen to file a lawsuit against her. A spokesman for Le Pen said a lawsuit for [...] "public insult" [...] would be lodged with the Paris courts in the next few days. Madonna responded to the lawsuit saying [...] "I know that I made a certain Marine Le Pen very angry with me. And it's not my intention to make enemies." [...] She later explained in an interview with Brazilian network Rede Globo, that the sequence was about [...] "intolerance that we human beings have for one another. And how much we judge people before knowing them. That's why it's done in the song 'Nobody Knows Me.'" [...] During her concert in Nice, France, the swastika was removed and was replaced by an interrogation mark.|$|E
