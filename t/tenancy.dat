5|$|The Milam Building has {{undergone}} many events, including fires, foreclosure, and ownership changes. It {{was owned by}} Principal Mutual Life Insurance Co. of Des Moines, Iowa while {{the law firm of}} Maloney & Maloney occupied the top three floors. The 1950s had a <b>tenancy</b> by Mobil, Shell, the Railroad Commission of Texas, and Exxon used the building for their Texas headquarters, before they moved to Houston. The 1960s saw a <b>tenancy</b> by the men's clothing firm Hutchins Brothers in the specially designed Argyle Room as a permanent retail store within the building.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} Cheadle Hulme was rural countryside, {{made up of}} woods, open land, and farms. The local {{population}} {{was made up of}} farmers and peasants, living in small cottages and working the land under the <b>tenancy</b> of the Lord of the Manor. Most families kept animals for food, grew their own crops, and probably bought and sold produce at Stockport market. Water was obtained from local wells and ponds, and sometimes the Micker Brook.|$|E
5|$|Pleydell's father, William, {{had been}} given a 95-year lease of the Midgehall estate in Lydiard Tregoze by the Abbott of Stanley Abbey in 1534. A 1545 record, {{ordering}} Gabriel to pay 26 shillings and 8 pence in benevolence to the crown under King Henry VIII, indicates that he was soon managing Midgehall's financial affairs. His father entrusted him in 1549 with <b>tenancy</b> of the manor house at West Ilsley, Berkshire and in September 1553 a sublease of the Midgehall estate. William died in 1555, leaving Midgehall's full lease to his wife, Agnes. When she died in 1567, Gabriel unsuccessfully challenged his mother's will (an action which estranged his younger brother, John) despite inheriting <b>tenancy</b> of the estate. Pleydell's father originally intended two of his elder sons—Virgil and Tobias—to succeed ownership before Gabriel. Virgil died around 1559 and by 1567 Tobias had been resident in Chipping Faringdon for 11 years, prompting him to relinquish his inheritance.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} {{the impacts of}} removal of sand and growing of Seheimab shelterbelt on irrigation canals of northwestern parts of the Gezira Scheme. The study targeted Abu Guta and Begigea blocks, eighty <b>tenancies</b> were randomly selected out of five villages adjacent to northwestern parts of the Gezira Scheme. Those <b>tenancies</b> {{were divided into two}} groups: the first one whose <b>tenancies</b> were previously affected by desertification then rehabilitated and the other group was for those <b>tenancies</b> that were not rehabilitated. The evaluation was relevant to level of agricultural productivity as they live in the same geographical area. Descriptive statistic indicated that most of the <b>tenancies</b> shared the same social characteristics. It also indicated that the <b>tenancies</b> on rehabilitated land had higher annual income, which reflected their stability of crops cultivated areas. The effort for establishment of shelterbelts led to protection of some canals and restored some irrigation area from sand encroachment for the rehabilitated <b>tenancies.</b> For non-rehabilitated <b>tenancies,</b> productivity was directly affected by desertification. <b>Tenancies</b> of rehabilitated fields owned more animals than the <b>tenancies</b> of nonrehabilitated fields because of their ability to keep animals and sell them when market price was high. However the non-rehabilitated <b>tenancies</b> were compelled to sell their animals at lower prices to satisfy urgent consumption need to compensate for their low income from other sources. When comparing rehabilitated and non affected <b>tenancies</b> in the block of Abu Guta using the official records for cotton, to confident the stability of crops cultivated areas found that the average yield for rehabilitated <b>tenancies</b> was less than the yield obtained by those in non affected areas. This was attributed to the decline in the quality of the soil being affected by sand after rehabilitation. The study concluded that restoring of the irrigation capacity, soil quality and establishing shelterbelts (to some extent) helped in increasing income of the <b>tenancies</b> in desert prone areas in Gezira Scheme...|$|R
5|$|Alexander died in 1944, and {{the death}} duties proved {{crippling}} to Geoffrey. In 1949 he sold the castle and 3,480 hectares (8,600acres) of the lands to the Ashdale Property Company, retaining a <b>tenancy</b> of the castle for himself. The Crown Estate bought the estate from Ashdale and sold the castle back to Geoffrey in 1954. His son Colonel Walter Luttrell lived away from Dunster, and {{following the death of}} his mother– the last Luttrell to live in the property– gave the castle and most of its contents to the National Trust in 1976.|$|E
5|$|At the Town Hall, Joan asks Mr Johnson (Colin Prockter) about {{applying}} for a flat in the new high-rise estate; she is told she is unlikely to get a <b>tenancy,</b> as preference {{will be given to}} those with young children. At the Nag's Head, Freddie and Reg meet, and Reg invites him to his house to continue drinking. After meeting Joan and buying her a drink, Freddie realises that she is a Trotter, a family he has a dislike for. After they return to the Trotters' house, Freddie shows his affection for Joan.|$|E
5|$|Compton Mackenzie, an English born Scottish novelist, {{acquired}} the <b>tenancy.</b> He recalled that his three years there had numerous logistical problems. It {{has been suggested}} that Mackenzie was the basis for the character Mr Cathcart in D.H.

5|$|During the Second World War, Anlaby Road {{was damaged}} by enemy bombing, the repair cost {{of which was}} in the region of £1,000. The Cricket Club served notice to quit at the same time, and so in 1943 the <b>tenancy</b> was officially ended. Hull were forced to return to the Boulevard Ground from 1944 until 1945 because of the poor {{condition}} of the planned stadium at Boothferry Road.

The protection of the 1986 Act remains in respect of <b>tenancies</b> created prior to the existence of the 1995 Act, and for those <b>tenancies</b> falling within section 4 of the 1995 Act.

5|$|At {{some unknown}} date the {{symbolic}} snowball and calf tokens {{owed to the}} Campbells were commuted to payment of money rent which increased over the years. In 1806, the chief was forced to relinquish the <b>tenancy</b> of Glen Noe due to inability to meet the payments. The chief and his family emigrated to the United States, where the family continues to reside. Although {{the identities of the}} chiefs were always known to interested clan members, the chiefship of the clan was not officially recognized by Scottish authorities until 1991, when the coat of arms of James Wallace MacIntyre of Glenoe was confirmed by the Lord Lyon, King of Arms.

5|$|Civil strife {{and foreign}} invasions, {{such as the}} Mongol invasions in 1240/1241, 1259/1260 and 1287/1288, {{weakened}} and depopulated many of the small Polish principalities, as the country was becoming progressively more subdivided. Depopulation and increasing demand for labor caused a massive immigration of West European peasants into Poland, mostly German settlers; the early waves from Germany and Flanders occurred in the 1220s. The German, Polish and other new rural settlements represented a form of feudal <b>tenancy</b> with legal immunity and German town laws were often utilized as its legal bases. German immigrants were also important {{in the rise of}} the cities and the establishment of the Polish burgher (city dwelling merchants) class; they brought with them West European laws (Magdeburg rights) and customs that the Poles adopted. From that time, the Germans, who created early strong establishments (led by patriciates) especially in the urban centers of Silesia and other regions of western Poland, were an increasingly influential minority in Poland.|$|E

5|$|In Gannon's first match {{back at the}} club, {{the team}} lost a match 2–1 to joint-leaders Fleetwood Town, who {{achieved}} a record attendance in the fixture at Highbury. Gannon managed Stockport to their first back-to-back wins in over three years, since his last stint as manager, with successive 1–0 victories over Wrexham and Darlington.

Gannon again focused on youth development, inducing young players such as Danny Whitehead, Cameron Darkwah, Danny Hattersley and Ian Ormson into the starting eleven.

The Marquess only held the abbey for two years: after supporting Lady Jane Grey's claim to the throne, in 1553, on the accession of Bloody Mary, he was arrested and his lands were confiscated. Mary granted the abbey and mansion to her catholic supporter Edward Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings of Loughborough, however he too fell from favour when Mary's sister Elizabeth I came to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Local {{architect}} Thomas Bower performed some alterations to {{the house}} for Robert Crewe-Milnes in 1896, including extending the service wing. Few changes to the hall itself occurred during Calmic's <b>tenancy.</b> The company installed central heating in around 1948, and later constructed an office extension {{on the north side}} of the house, which was demolished a few years after the building's conversion into an hotel. Calmic had undertaken only cosmetic maintenance work, and by the 1970s the fabric of the building was in poor repair. A major stonework fall from the north gable during high winds in 1974 led Wellcome to carry out an extensive restoration programme to both the interior and the exterior, which was completed in 1979 at a cost of £500,000 (£ today).|$|E
