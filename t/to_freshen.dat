5|$|In 1871, Nikolai Zaremba {{resigned}} from the directorship of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. His successor, Mikhaíl Azanchevsky, was more progressive-minded musically and wanted new blood <b>to</b> <b>freshen</b> up teaching in the Conservatory. He offered Rimsky-Korsakov a professorship in Practical Composition and Instrumentation (orchestration), as well as leadership of the Orchestra Class. Balakirev, who had formerly opposed academicism with tremendous vigor, encouraged him to assume the post, thinking it might be useful having {{one of his own}} {{in the midst of the}} enemy camp.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{explained}} {{in his memoirs}} that Mikhaíl Azanchevsky had taken over that year {{as director of the}} Conservatory, and wanting new blood <b>to</b> <b>freshen</b> up teaching in those subjects, had offered to pay generously for Rimsky-Korsakov's services. Biographer Mikhail Zetlin suggests that Azanchevsky's motives might have been twofold. First, Rimsky-Korsakov was the member of the Five least criticized by its opponents, and inviting him to teach at the Conservatory may have been considered a safe way to show that all serious musicians were welcome there. Second, the offer may have been calculated to expose him to an academic climate in which he would write in a more conservative, Western-based style. Balakirev had opposed academic training in music with tremendous vigor, but encouraged him to accept the post to convince others to join the nationalist musical cause.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, the Eds {{wake up in}} {{a trailer}} home, where three girls are staring down at them. The boys have already been changed out of their dirty clothes and put into clean robes, which the girls inform them each belong {{to one of their}} three {{respective}} dads. Explaining that they are new to the area, the girls introduce themselves as Lee (Janyse Jaud), Marie (Kathleen Barr) and May Kanker (Erin Fitzgerald). The Eds begin to offer their own introductions, but are stopped short by the sisters who are already familiar with the boys' names. As the Kankers head into the kitchen to prepare food for the Eds, Double D anxiously proposes that the three of them leave. However, Eddy stops him, insisting that they stay at least for the free food. Looking around, the boys notice drawings of themselves, each paired with one the Kankers: Ed with May, Double D with Marie, and Eddy with Lee. Although left unsettled by this discovery, they eagerly accept the food that is brought out to them and begin to relax, as the Kankers slip a movie into the VCR and go upstairs <b>to</b> <b>freshen</b> up.|$|E

500|$|In 2009, as Cook put it, [...] "to try somewhere else, and <b>to</b> <b>freshen</b> up our brand a bit", The Wiggles {{ended their}} long {{relationship}} with the Disney Channel in the U.S. when they entered into a five-year-long partnership with the digital cable channel Sprout. [...] They also aired previous episodes of their show on the channel, created and hosted a three-hour block of programming that aired in the mornings, and created online and on-demand content. [...] Sprout called the partnership [...] "Our biggest acquisition... that Sprout has ever done". [...] Cook stated that the move was not [...] "acrimonious", and although the group owed much of their early success to Disney, that it [...] "was just business".

500|$|... "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show" [...] {{was written}} by David S. Cohen and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore. The episode was conceived as a commentary on {{what it was like}} to work on a television show that had long been on the air, but was considered to be nearing its end. This was intended to show that The Simpsons could still be good after eight seasons, even though it no longer had the [...] "shock value" [...] it did in the early years. Before production of season eight began, several executives at Fox suggested the staff add a new character to the show, who would live with the Simpsons on a permanent basis, in a bid <b>to</b> <b>freshen</b> up the series. The writers found the suggestion, usually considered a sign of desperation to boost a flagging series, amusing, therefore much of the episode revolves around this trope. Parallel to the episode's main plot, where Poochie is introduced on The Itchy & Scratchy Show to boost its ratings, the writers inserted the one-time character Roy, a college-aged man who is shown to be living with the Simpsons, with no explanation as to his character or presence, as a reference to the executives' proposal. Roy was originally conceived for the [...] "Time and Punishment" [...] segment of the season six episode [...] "Treehouse of Horror V", living with the Simpsons in one of the alternate realities, as a second, teenage son in the family.|$|E
500|$|With the {{transfer}} window reopening in January, Danny Wilson's first signing was {{the return of}} former loan player Marcus Williams who agreed a {{two and a half}} year deal. [...] The New Year started disappointingly as the Blades crashed to their first defeat since the beginning of November as they were beaten 3–2 at Carlisle United. Following Danny Wilson being awarded 'League One Manager of the Month' for December, United soon got back to winning ways when they returned to home soil. [...] The team saw off Salisbury City 3–1 in the third round of the FA Cup, the first meeting ever between the two clubs, and then outclassed Yeovil Town a few days later, hitting four without reply including a brace from Lee Williamson and a first ever club goal from captain Michael Doyle. With Danny Wilson looking <b>to</b> <b>freshen</b> up his squad United rewarded four of its younger players with contract extensions, with Erik Tønne and David McAllister set to remain with the club until the summer of 2014, and youth team players Jordan Chapell and Jack Adams agreeing new deals {{until the end of the}} season. In a busy day the club saw the departure of Elian Parrino as his short term deal came to an end, and then allowed McAllister to join League Two club Shrewsbury Town on a months loan, with manager Danny Wilson bemoaning a lack of reserve games under the current system. [...] The following week Wilson continued to overhaul the squad with reserve keeper Mihkel Aksalu leaving the club on mutual terms, but was boosted by 'fans favourite' James Beattie agreeing a deal to remain at Bramall Lane until the end of the season. Meanwhile, back in the league the Blades then continued their fine run of form, completing their second league double of the week, as they hit three without reply away at Bury, but that form deserted them for a top-of-the-table trip to Charlton Athletic where a bad tempered match resulted in both teams being reduced to ten men and a 1–0 loss for United. [...] Seven days later United suffered their first back-to-back defeats of the season as they crashed out of the FA Cup at the hands of Birmingham City. With {{the transfer}} window about to close Bramall Lane was relatively quite on deadline day; Danny Philliskirk was handed an extended deal, and striker Will Hoskins signed on loan from Brighton & Hove Albion until the end of the season, whilst youngster Erik Tønne was allowed to join Yorkshire neighbours York City, also until the end of the season. The club also gave a trial to experienced Scottish defender David Weir with a view to a potential short term contract.|$|E

30|$|A similar heat/salt flux {{data set}} {{was created for}} the Sea of Okhotsk, using AMSR-E ice concentration, thin-ice {{thickness}} and ice drift data (Nihashi et al. 2012). The spatial distribution of the annual fluxes shows the significant ocean cooling with salt supply in the northern coastal polynya region, while ocean heating with freshwater supply in the south. This clearly demonstrates the role of sea-ice formation/melting with its prominent southward transport by the prevailing northerly wind and current (Fukamachi et al. 2009; Simizu et al. 2014) on redistribution of heat and salt. It is pointed out that this redistribution system by sea ice has weakened. A recently constructed hydrographic dataset from the Okhotsk Sea reveals a prominent <b>freshening</b> <b>to</b> depths of 500  m during the past four decades, with the maximum in the northwestern {{part of the sea}} (Ohshima et al. 2014). It is proposed that the freshening is caused by the weakening of salt/freshwater redistribution through a decrease in sea-ice production. In conjunction with a recent freshening in high latitude oceans, previous studies have mainly examined changes in the enhanced global hydrological cycle due to changes in net evaporation and precipitation (Durack et al. 2012). It is demonstrated that sea-ice decline can be an important contributor <b>to</b> <b>freshening</b> in ice-covered regions of the world ocean.|$|R

2500|$|Many of the {{supplements}} released for the Second edition {{fall into}} a story arc set up by new writers and line editors that was intended <b>to</b> <b>freshen</b> up the game and broaden roleplay possibilities.

In particular, many felt the removal of the Computer - and thus the power structure associated with it - and the greater freedom given to player characters effectively wrecked the very premise of the game, which required that player characters had little freedom, had to appease the demands of the Computer, and were presented with insane situations that arose from the ludicrous rules of Alpha Complex society.

2500|$|The Indian cricket team, humiliated in {{all forms}} {{of the game in}} the tour, was the subject of ridicule from the media and former cricketers. The Australian wrote under the {{headline}} [...] "India's pillars of strength reduced to useless rubble" [...] Dhoni is not the only shaky pillar of what only eight months ago was the number one cricket nation in the world. VVS Laxman, once the scourge of Australian bowlers, is being flayed himself at home after scores of 2,1, 2, 66, 31 and 0. Virender Sehwag, who warmed up for this series by scoring the fastest double century in One-Day International history, also is trending south faster than Scott and Amundsen, having followed up his whirlwind 67 in Melbourne with innings of 7, 30, 4, 0 and 10. Worst of all, Dhoni has failed with the bat. The Indian captain is no thunderer at the best of times – neither is coach Duncan Fletcher, which may be part of the problem – but how can he demand more of his batsmen when he has nowhere to hide behind scores of 6, 23, 57no, 2, 12 and 2? India has not had a single century-maker in the past three Tests, The Daily Telegraph said that India's performance was [...] "so bad that the first question that came Michael Clarke's way at the press conference was 'did it feel as if you were playing Bangladesh?'". The newspaper also played up Dhoni's one-match ban due to the Indian team's slow over-rate in the third Test. Under the headline 'Dhoni dumped from Adelaide Test', the newspaper wrote, [...] "India's shambolic tour of Australia plunged into unprecedented disarray when their captain MS Dhoni was sensationally banned from playing in the final Test due to slow over rates". The Herald Sun wrote about how Australia built up a team after the Ashes humiliation last year while sarcastically mentioning the visiting players skipping practice sessions in the tour.As painful as it was, getting flogged in last year's Ashes may be remembered as the recession Australia had to have. Nothing is being taken for granted in Australian cricket any more. The new coaching unit is working well under head coach Mickey Arthur and Australia has worked hard <b>to</b> <b>freshen</b> up every aspect of its game. India, by contrast, just lobs along, its players pocketing millions each year and too spoilt to make major sacrifices. It's appropriate that many Indian players {{spent a lot of time}} last week sitting under trees at training, because their entire Test match game is being left in the shade.|$|E

40|$|Robert Darnton's book {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{faithful}} applications of the semiotic method to a study of unfamiliar symbolic forms that use Geertz's thick description. In particular, it was Geertz's interpretation of Balinese cockfights that became a model for Darnton's interpretation of the Great Cat Massacre on a certain street in Paris in the 1730 s. The criticism leveled at this famous book by J. W. Fernandez (an anthropologist), D. LaCapra (ideas historian) and R. Chartier (historian) is a reprise of the earlier criticism of Geertz by cultural anthropologists. It is also, mainly an "external criticism", which is to mean it is leveled from the post-structuralist, or even post-humanistic positions. Attempts to correct Darnton by redirecting the focus from the "native's point of view (of the participants in "the great cat massacre") to the "cat's point of view" as LaCapra would have wanted (which amounts <b>to</b> <b>freshening</b> the historical anthropology - according to Domańska - by tying it with another "turn" i. e. post humanism) may lead to (and this is well worth investigating) " the massacre of historical anthropology"...|$|R
