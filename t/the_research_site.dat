This {{article examines the}} challenges of participatory approaches to natural resource management drawing lessons from a participatory action research (PAR) with community forest user groups (CFUGs) in Nepal.

Several positive livelihood impacts were also noted {{as a result of}} applying the process, although the exact nature of these impacts varied between <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>sites.</b> Some major steps of the PAR process were found to be effective and therefore were adapted by CFUGs both in <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>sites</b> and beyond.

50|$|In a later study, Foster and Rhoden (1997) {{examined}} {{the effectiveness of}} soldiers in fortress defense. They manipulated the numbers of soldiers and non-soldiers in sets of galls that remained in contact with poplar trees at <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>site.</b> When there {{was a combination of}} soldiers and non-soldiers, the gall was ten times less likely to be attacked by a predator compared to a gall with only non-soldier aphids. These results led Foster and Rhoden to conclude that soldiers effectively defend against predation under natural conditions. Earlier laboratory experiments demonstrated that soldiers could prevent specialist gall predators from attacking the gall. However, in this study, Foster and Rhoden found that such protection could also take place in the field. Five different predators attack the P. spyrothecae galls: specialist A. minki, generalists S. ribesii and A. nemoralis and two other unidentified generalist predators.|$|E

Afterwards Dr. Swenson tells Marina of her suspicion that the man Mrs. Bovender saw was really Anders, whose death she had never confirmed. Along with Easter, Marina sets out to find the Hummocca and rescue Anders. When they find the tribe, Anders is indeed living among them, but Marina discovers {{that the only way}} they will give him up is to exchange Easter (a Hummocca himself) for Anders. Marina and Anders return to camp without Easter; Dr. Swenson is outraged that the boy she cared for was left behind.
