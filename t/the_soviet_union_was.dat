5|$|Cumulative U.S. {{military}} expenditures {{throughout the entire}} Cold War amounted to an estimated $8trillion.

5|$|After September 1939, desperate {{efforts were}} made to improve the situation, but with very little result. Germany, for obvious reasons, delayed its deliveries; France was {{hesitant}} to equip an army that would not unequivocally take its side. The one abundant source of readily available weaponry, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> <b>was</b> inaccessible because the Dutch, contrary to most other nations, did not recognise the communist regime. An attempt in 1940 to procure Soviet armour captured by Finland failed.|$|E
5|$|After the {{communist}} revolution in Afghanistan in 1978, authoritarian actions forced upon the populace by the Communist regime {{led to the}} Afghan civil war, with the mujahideen leading the popular backlash against the regime. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>was</b> worried that they were losing their influence in Central Asia, so after a KGB report claimed that Afghanistan could be taken {{in a matter of}} weeks, Brezhnev and several top party officials agreed to a full intervention in Afghanistan.|$|E

And in occupied France, the French resistance used the PIAT in the absence of mortars or artillery.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, a {{vigorous}} movement grew up protesting against abuse of psychiatry in the USSR.

The campaign to terminate political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was a key episode in the Cold War, inflicting irretrievable damage on the prestige of medicine in the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, 1985, {{power in}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>was</b> assumed by Mikhail Gorbachev.

Gorbachev's policies soon caused a corresponding shift in the policies of Soviet satellites, including the People's Republic of Poland.|$|E

5|$|The {{stabilization}} policy brought about after Khrushchev's removal established a ruling gerontocracy, and political corruption became a normal phenomenon.

5|$|Contemporaneously to {{establishment}} {{of the office of}} the President, representatives of the Congress of People's Deputies voted to remove Article 6 from the Soviet constitution which stated that <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>was</b> a one-party state controlled by the Communist Party which, in turn, played the leading role in society. This vote weakened the Party and its hegemony over the Soviet Union and its people. Upon death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent President, the Vice President of the Soviet Union would assume the office, though the Soviet Union collapsed before this was actually tested. After the failed August Coup the Vice President was replaced by an elected member of the State Council of the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|In April 1991 Vladimir Bukovsky visited Moscow for {{the first}} time since his {{deportation}} fifteen years before. In the run-up to the 1991 presidential election Boris Yeltsin's campaign team included Bukovsky on their list of potential vice-presidential running-mates. In the end, army officer Alexander Rutskoy, a veteran of the 1979‚Äì1989 war in Afghanistan and Hero of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>was</b> selected. On 5 December 1991 both of Bukovsky's Soviet-era convictions were annulled by a decree of the RSFSR Supreme Court.
