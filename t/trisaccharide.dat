25|$|The {{principal}} soluble carbohydrates {{of mature}} soybeans are the disaccharide sucrose (range 2.5–8.2%), the <b>trisaccharide</b> raffinose (0.1–1.0%) composed of one sucrose molecule connected to one molecule of galactose, and the tetrasaccharide stachyose (1.4 to 4.1%) composed of one sucrose connected to two molecules of galactose. While the oligosaccharides raffinose and stachyose protect {{the viability of}} the soybean seed from desiccation (see above section on physical characteristics) they are not digestible sugars, so contribute to flatulence and abdominal discomfort in humans and other monogastric animals, comparable to the disaccharide trehalose. Undigested oligosaccharides are broken down in the intestine by native microbes, producing gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane.|$|E
40|$|Purified beta-glucosidase from Fusarium oxysporum catalyses {{hydrolysis}} and transglycosylation reactions. By {{utilizing the}} transglycosylation reaction, <b>trisaccharides</b> and alkyl beta-D-glucosides were synthesized under optimal {{conditions in the}} presence of various disaccharides and alcohols. The yields of <b>trisaccharides</b> and alkyl beta-D-glucosides were 22 - 37 % and 10 - 33 % of the total sugar, respectively. The enzyme retained 70 - 80 % of its original activity {{in the presence of}} 25 % (w/v) methanol, ethanol and propanol. Thus, beta-glucosidase from F. oxysporum appears to be an ideal enzyme for the synthesis of useful <b>trisaccharides</b> and alkyl beta-D-glucosides...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Trisaccharides</b> are {{oligosaccharides}} {{composed of}} three monosaccharides with two glycosidic bonds connecting them. Similar to the disaccharides, each glycosidic bond can be formed between any hydroxyl {{group on the}} component monosaccharides. Even if all three component sugars are the same (e.g., glucose), different bond combinations (regiochemistry) and stereochemistry (alpha- or beta-) result in <b>trisaccharides</b> that are diastereoisomers with different chemical and physical properties ...|$|R

The lectin Phytolacca americana was used. A statistically significant reduction in ferritin particles and hence, glucosamine <b>trisaccharides,</b> was found in the glycocalyx of the hyperstimulated animals when compared with that of the controls. This reduction could contribute to the failure of implantation in hyperstimulated animals...|$|R
2500|$|Malt is {{germinate}}d cereal grains {{that have been}} dried in {{a process known as}} [...] "malting". The grains are made to germinate by soaking in water, and are then halted from germinating further by drying with hot air. Malting grains develops the enzymes required for modifying the grain's starches into various types of sugar, including the monosaccharide glucose, the disaccharide maltose, the <b>trisaccharide</b> maltotriose, and higher sugars called maltodextrines. It also develops other enzymes, such as proteases, which break down the proteins in the grain into forms that can be used by yeast. Depending on when the malting process is stopped one gets a preferred starch enzyme ratio and partly converted starch into fermentable sugars. Malt also contains small amounts of other sugars, such as sucrose and fructose, which are not products of starch modification but were already in the grain. Further conversion to fermentable sugars is achieved during the mashing process.|$|E

40|$|Spectra-structure {{relationships}} were investigated for estimating the anomeric configuration, residues {{and type of}} linkages of linear and branched <b>trisaccharides</b> using 13 C-NMR chemical shifts. For this study, 119 pyranosyl <b>trisaccharides</b> were used that are trimers of the α or β anomers of D-glucose, D-galactose, D-mannose, L-fucose or L-rhamnose residues bonded through a or b glycosidic linkages of types 1 → 2, 1 → 3, 1 → 4, or 1 → 6, as well as methoxylated and/or N-acetylated amino <b>trisaccharides.</b> Machine learning experiments were performed for: (1) classification of the anomeric configuration of the first unit, second unit and reducing end; (2) classification {{of the type of}} first and second linkages; (3) classification of the three residues: reducing end, middle and first residue; and (4) classification of the chain type. Our previously model for predicting the structure of disaccharides was incorporated in this new model with an improvement of the predictive power. The best results were achieved using Random Forests with 204 di- and <b>trisaccharides</b> for the training set—it could correctly classify 83 %, 90 %, 88 %, 85 %, 85 %, 75 %, 79 %, 68 % and 94 % of the test set (69 compounds) for the nine tasks, respectively, on the basis of unassigned chemical shifts...|$|R
40|$|Lewis X <b>trisaccharides</b> {{normally}} {{function as}} essential cell-cell interaction mediators. However, oligomers of Lewis X <b>trisaccharides</b> {{expressed by the}} parasite Schistosoma mansoni seem {{to be related to}} its evasion of the immune response of its human host. Here we show that monoclonal antibody 54 - 5 C 10 -A, which is used to diagnose schistosomiasis in humans, interacts with oligomers of at least three Lewis X <b>trisaccharides,</b> but not with monomeric Lewis X. We describe the sequence and the 2. 5 Å crystal structure of its Fab fragment and infer a possible mode of binding of the polymeric Lewis X from docking studies. Our studies indicate a radically different mode of binding compared to Fab 291 - 2 G 3 -A, which is specific for monomeric Lewis X, thus providing a structural explanation of the diagnostic success of 54 - 5 C 10 -A.

40|$|Based on the {{structure}} of the regular heparin, we have prepared a smart library of heparin-like <b>trisaccharides</b> by incorporating some sulfate groups in the sequence a-D-GlcNS- (1 - 4) -a-L-Ido 2 S-(1 - 4) -a-D-GlcN. According to the 3 Dstructure of heparin, which features one helix turn every four residues, this fragment corresponds to the minimum binding motif. We have performed a complete NMR study and found that the <b>trisaccharides</b> have a similar 3 Dstructure to regular heparin itself, but their spectral properties are such that allow to extract very detailed information about distances and coupling constants as they are isotropic molecules. The characteristic conformational equilibrium of the central iduronate ring has been analyzed combining NMR and molecular dynamics and the populations of the conformers of the central iduronate ring have been calculated. We have found that in those compounds lacking the sulfate group at position 6 of the reducing end glucosamine, the population of S of the central iduronate residue is sensitive to the temperature decreasing to 19 % at 278 K. On the contrary, the <b>trisaccharides</b> with 6 -O-sulfate in the reducing end glucosamine keep the level of population constant with temperature circa 40 % of S similar to that observed at room temperature. Another structural feature that has been revealed through this analysis is the larger flexibility of the L-IdoAS- D-GlcN glycosidic linkage, compared with the D-GlcNS-L-IdoA. We propose that this is the point where the heparin chain is bended to form structures far from the regular helix known as kink that have been proposed {{to play an important role}} in the specificity of the heparin-protein interaction. The sulfation pattern of the neighboring ring drives the conformational equilibrium of iduronate in heparin <b>trisaccharides.</b> A library of heparin-like <b>trisaccharides</b> incorporating sulfate groups in key positions has been prepared. The conformational equilibrium of the central iduronate ring has been analyzed and the populations were calculated by combining NMR and molecular dynamics (see figure). © 2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

50|$|Recently, new {{reagents}} {{have been}} developed that allow for the specific measurement of endo-cellulase. These methods involve the use of functionalised oligosaccharide substrates {{in the presence of}} an ancillary enzyme. In the example shown, a cellulase enzyme is able to recognise the <b>trisaccharide</b> fragment of cellulose and cleave this unit. The ancillary enzyme present in the reagent mixture (β-glucosidase) then acts to hydrolyse the fragment containing the chromophore or fluorophore. The assay is terminated by the addition of a basic solution that stops the enzymatic reaction and deprotonates the liberated phenolic compound to produce the phenolate species. The cellulase activity of a given sample is directly proportional to the quantity of phenolate liberated which can be measured using a spectrophotometer. The acetal functionalisation on the non-reducing end of the <b>trisaccharide</b> substrate prevents the action of the ancillary β-glucosidase on the parent substrate.|$|E
5000|$|Monosaccharides can {{be linked}} {{together}} by glycosidic bonds, which can be cleaved by hydrolysis.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{isobaric}} disaccharide-alditols, four derived from O-linked glycoproteins, and select <b>trisaccharides</b> were rapidly resolved using tandem high resolution atmospheric pressure ion-mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

Using this technique {{it was possible to}} separate up to three isobaric disaccharide alditols and three <b>trisaccharides</b> in the gas phase. Reduced mobility values and experimentally determined ion-neutral cross sections are reported for each sodium-carbohydrate complex. These studies demonstrated that ion mobility separations at atmospheric pressure can provide a high-resolution dimension for analysis of carbohydrate ions that is complementary to traditional mass spectral (m/z) ion analysis. Combining these independent principles for separation of ions provides a powerful new bioanalytical tool for the identification of isomeric carbohydrates...|$|R
5000|$|A {{diastase}} ( [...] ; from Greek διαστασις, [...] "separation") is {{any one of}} a {{group of}} enzymes which catalyses the breakdown of starch into maltose.
