40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the private costs of delaying {{privatization}} of TOT Public Company Limited, a state-owned enterprise <b>telephony</b> <b>carrier.</b> To address the private costs of a delay in terms of privatization, a counterfactual forecasting model has been constructed for the years 2007 - 2012. The starting year of the evaluation is 2006, as this year was the deadline for privatization under the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement. The forecasting model uses the traditional investment approach as well as scenario analyses. The traditional investment approach and sensitivity analyses provide similar results. Both show that the benefit of delaying the privatization process could be higher than if the WTO-agreed time process for TOT privatization were followed, as the growth of revenue sharing and from concessionaires would be higher than if TOT were privatized. There are no benefits in the long run, however, as the growth rate of revenue in the base case is lower than that in the privatization case, leading to a reduction in the present value of the base case over time: hence, the longer the delay in privatization, the slower the firm growth...|$|E

2500|$|In {{historical}} perspective, telecommunication terms {{have been}} used with different semantics over time. The term telephone exchange is often used synonymously with central office (CO), a Bell System term. Often, a central office {{is defined as a}} building used to house the inside plant equipment of potentially several telephone exchanges, each serving a certain geographical area. Such an area has also been referred to as the exchange. Central office locations may also be identified in North America as wire centers, designating a facility from which a telephone obtains dial tone. [...] For business and billing purposes, <b>telephony</b> <b>carriers</b> also define rate centers, which in larger cities may be clusters of central offices, to define specified geographical locations for determining distance measurements.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005 {{they became}} one of the first <b>telephony</b> <b>carriers</b> to {{introduce}} the concept of [...] "Dynamic Bandwidth" [...] as an official product. [...] Dynamic Bandwidth works by transmitting voice and data over a T1 connection using ATM as the underlying protocol. The amount of available bandwidth for data [...] "expands" [...] by 64k for each voice line not in use. When a voice line goes off-hook, the bandwidth reserved for that voice line becomes solely available for use with that line until the call ends, when it becomes usable for data again. Using this concept, a T1 that would normally provide 768k of data and 12 voice lines can provide a full 1.536 Mbit/s connection when no voice lines are in use.|$|R

40|$|Working people {{employee}} the use {{of technology}} in such very effective natural ways that permit them to do what they want: they can communicate with anyone as per need, in the time and space that suits them the best. Easily accessible and user-friendly, collaboration tools allow them to explore, share, engage, and connect with people and content in meaningful ways that help them learn. Traditional <b>telephony</b> <b>carriers</b> use circuit switching for carrying voice traffic. Circuit switching was designed for voice from the outset; hence it carries voice in an efficient manner. However it is an expensive solution. Nowadays people want to talk much more on phone, but they also want to communicate in a myriad of other ways - through e-mail, instant messaging, video, the World Wide Web, etc. Circuit switching is not suitable for this new world of multimedia communication. Therefore, in this paper a solution is proposed to implement scalable VOIP system over Fatima Jinnah University that will lead to better Quality of service and facilitates enhanced communicatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} the Internet Protocol (IP) on {{telephony}} is anticipated to replace traditional voice services with integrated voice and IP-based applications. The traditional telephony networks, though technically and economically unsuited to supporting the integrated applications including messaging and e-commerce, will nonetheless be leveraged by {{the ability to be}} interconnected and interoperate with IP networks. The potential for leveraging IP-based applications together with the traditional telephony infrastructure will likely create new markets for traditional <b>telephony</b> <b>carriers,</b> opening the opportunity for new alliances and partnerships with content providers, broadcast networks and integrated network service providers to enterprises. These new alliances will generate both opportunities for economic growth of a re-shaped telecommunications industry as well as challenges to the traditional approaches to its governance and regulation. Specifically, there will be an increased need to harmonize the progression of international technical standards for IP and the traditional telephony spheres as well as assessment of the implications of regulation presently applied to telephony as voice and video services become increasingly integrated within new IP-based applications delivered across a broad based communications infrastructure. ...|$|R

40|$|In Section I of this Article, I {{provide an}} {{introduction}} to regulation and problems of trade in services and illustrate how the basic GATS framework extends to cover regulation of Internet services. Section II discusses two short studies that highlight these problems of trade in information services. China, {{one of the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s most comprehensive Internet regulators, makes for an interesting case because as a condition to accession to the WTO, it agreed to what have been called 2 ̆ 2 radical 2 ̆ 2 reforms of its service practices. Yet at the same time, China is among the world 2 ̆ 7 s more active filterers of Internet services. As we shall see, these two positions are in tension, and while WTO law leaves much room for exceptions, some of China 2 ̆ 7 s restrictions may have trouble being justified under the GATS. The second study is of Voice-over-IP services. Companies like the well- known 2 ̆ 2 Skype 2 ̆ 2 offer free voice telephone services to anyone with an Internet connection. As a consequence, in many instances incumbent <b>telephony</b> <b>carriers,</b> often state-owned, have a strong competitive interest in preventing VoIP from reaching their citizens. These instances of Skype-blocking in several countries raise interesting trade-in-services issues...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} ten years, the {{international}} telecommunications industry has undergone important changes from both the legislative (regulatory reforms) and the technological points of view. The liberalization of the telecommunications market has, consequently, affected {{the dynamics of the}} bilateral agreements between international carriers. In this paper, the international wholesale market in which carriers compete over the tariffs in order to increase their market share is analyzed. In particular, this paper examines the interactions between fixed <b>telephony</b> TLC <b>carriers</b> belonging to various countries and analyzes the possible strategic choices of the market leader induced by changes in competitor behavior...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} days of mobile <b>telephony,</b> the {{operators}} (<b>carriers)</b> charged for all air time consumed by the mobile phone user, which included both outbound and inbound telephone calls.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an economic analysis {{the use of}} an IP-PBX for premises telephony. The analysis estimates the impact of installing an IP-PBX on the cost of premises, local and long distance calling. Results show that an IP-PBX is more expensive than traditional Centrex when only premises telephony costs are considered. This is largely due to the current high costs of gateway equipment to interface an IP-PBX to the Public Switched Telephone Network. As an immature product, IP Telephony equipment costs are high, but are projected to decline sharply in the future. The higher costs of an IP-PBX can be offset by savings in toll calls, particularly for medium and large firms. These savings are largely obtained on intra-corporate calls, which are assumed to travel entirely as IP between IP-PBXs at each end. Internet <b>Telephony</b> Interexchange <b>Carriers</b> (ITXCs) currently provide low cost toll services. They realize cost savings through the avoidance of access charges paid by traditional IXCs. Both Centrex and IP-PBX users may make use of an ITXC to lower toll calling costs. However, an IP-PBX user, by delivering calls already in packet form, enables the ITXC to avoid incoming gatewa...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of its}} Intercarrier Compensation Reform Docket, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has {{received}} many proposals advocating for the adoption of regulations relating to tandem transit services. As transiting affects virtually every carrier in the telecommunications industry, including traditional CLECs, cable <b>telephony</b> providers, wireless <b>carriers,</b> and even traditional ILECs, the industry is sharply divided over which, if any, of those proposals should be adopted. This Article provides an in-depth look at the issues dividing the industry, and the various proposals before the FCC. The Authors then hypothesize that the FCC should {{follow the lead of}} several state commissions who have addressed this exact issue and adopt a nationwide policy that would facilitate the continued growth of competition in the tandem transiting market, as this result would best serve consumers, telecommunications providers, and the industry as a whole...|$|R
40|$|Ferrites have widely {{been used}} in {{different}} electrical engineering applications including radio and TV sets as well as <b>carrier</b> <b>telephony</b> as cores of inductors, transformers and so forth, for their good electrical and mechanical properties. However, {{a substantial amount of}} foreign exchange is spent every year on the import of either finished ferrite products or raw materials for making these ferrites. The main aim of the present work was to produce different types of ferrites at comparatively low cost with improved electrical and mechanical properties using locally available raw materials. Three types of ferrites, namely, Manganese-Zinc (Mnx Zn 1 -x Fe 204), Nickel Zinc (Nix Znâ€“x Fe 2 04) and Copper-Zinc (Cux Znl-x Fe 2 04) ferrites with x = 0. 66, 0. 77, 0. 88 and 0. 99 were prepared by conventional double sintering method.

40|$|The last 30 {{years have}} seen huge {{technological}} and commercial developments {{in the field of}} telecommunications. The main product of the telecommunications industry has until recently been voice telephony. With the growth of data and multimedia services in the last decade the role of voice telephony is changing. In recent years telecommunications manufacturers have begun producing and marketing a new network concept for voice services entitled Next Generation Networks (NGN). These networks are based on packet switching technology as opposed to the circuit switching technology traditionally used in voice <b>telephony.</b> And telecom <b>carriers</b> like BT are replacing their Circuit switch based PSTN equipments by packet switching based Next Generation Networks products. Therefore in this study analysis and observation have been done of that process of migration from PSTN to IP/MPLS. Only BT has fully in progress for this migration through their 21 Century Network Project up till now and layout their plan for broadband dial tone to every customer till 2009. This study examine the each domain of the 21 CN of BT and design architecture for each domain, new services and physical network and main companies involve in this project and the identification of the equipments that will be deploying in each domain of 21 CN of BT with their features and functions and most importantly the advantages of the Next generation networks for the Customers and the telecom operatorsFaculty of Technolog...|$|R
