5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sagging</b> {{popularity}} of the Republic did not escape {{the attention of the}} British intelligence services. However, because this intelligence was filtered through the eyes of Orangist agents in the Republic and émigrés in England, it was erroneously interpreted as possible support for an Orangist restoration. This caused the miscalculation that led to the ill-fated Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in the peninsula of North Holland in 1799.|$|E
5|$|Rifting {{started to}} create the Gulf of California far to the south 6 to 10million years ago. Around the same time, {{the western edge of}} the Colorado Plateau may have sagged slightly. Both events changed the {{direction}} of many streams toward <b>the</b> <b>sagging</b> region and the increased gradient caused them to downcut much faster. From 5.5million to 5million years ago, headward erosion to the north and east consolidated these streams into one major river and associated tributary channels. This river, the ancestral Lower Colorado River, started to fill the northern arm of the gulf, which extended nearly to the site of Hoover Dam, with estuary deposits.|$|E
5|$|The four {{objectives}} of the operation (which evolved over time) were to boost <b>the</b> <b>sagging</b> morale of the Saigon regime in the Republic of Vietnam, to persuade North Vietnam to cease its support for the communist insurgency in South Vietnam without actually taking any ground forces into communist North Vietnam, to destroy North Vietnam's transportation system, industrial base, and air defenses, and to halt the flow of men and material into South Vietnam. Attainment of these objectives was made difficult by both the restraints imposed upon the U.S. and its allies by Cold War exigencies and by the military aid and assistance received by North Vietnam from its communist allies, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China (PRC) and North Korea.|$|E

25|$|Post-explantation ptosis, <b>the</b> <b>sagging</b> of the inelastic skin envelopes, once {{emptied of}} the breast implants.|$|E
25|$|Pseudoptosis — The {{indication}} is <b>the</b> <b>sagging</b> of {{the skin}} of the lower half (inferior pole) of the breast, featuring the nipple located either at or above the inframammary fold (IMF); as such, pseudoptosis is a usual consequence of postpartum milk-gland atrophy. The nipple is located either at or above the IMF, while {{the lower half of the}} breast sags below the IMF. Pseudoptosis usually occurs when the woman ceases nursing, because the milk glands have atrophied, and so reduced the volume of the breast, thus <b>the</b> <b>sagging</b> of the breast-envelope skin.|$|E
25|$|In {{the young}} woman with large breasts <b>the</b> <b>sagging</b> occurs because of the volume and weight of a bust that is disproportionate to the woman’s body type, {{and because of the}} great {{elasticity}} of the thin, young skin envelope of each breast.|$|E

50|$|The LIRR opened <b>the</b> <b>Sag</b> Harbor Branch, {{including}} the present Montauk Branch from Eastport to Bridgehampton, on June 8, 1870. On July 27, 1881, after the South Side {{became part of}} the LIRR, its line - then the Montauk Division - was extended east to <b>the</b> <b>Sag</b> Harbor Branch at Eastport. <b>The</b> <b>Sag</b> Harbor Branch east of Eastport {{became part of the}} Montauk Division, and the old line from Manor (Manorville) to Eastport became the Manor Branch. An extension to Montauk, splitting off <b>the</b> old <b>Sag</b> Harbor Branch at Bridgehampton, opened to Amagansett on June 1, 1895 and to Montauk by September, and the line between Bridgehampton and Sag Harbor reverted to <b>the</b> old <b>Sag</b> Harbor Branch name.|$|R

25|$|The Copeland House is {{an example}} of Wright's {{remodeling}} design work. It is listed as a contributing property to the Frank Lloyd Wright-Prairie School of Architecture Historic District. The historic district joined the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The William Copeland House is one of three homes in Oak Park that Wright was commissioned to remodel. The other two are the 1906 Peter A. Beachy House and the Hills-DeCaro House, also on Forest Avenue. Wright also added a large brick fireplace to the library. However, as was so often the, (as evidenced by <b>the</b> <b>sagging</b> cantilevers at Falling Water and <b>the</b> <b>sagging</b> second floor of the Heurtley House) Wright's use of available materials exceeded their structural capacity. The mantle of the fireplace is a large stone that cracked {{under the weight of the}} bricks, as did steps in the front stairway. The center wall of the coach house also sank due to inadequacy of the center foundation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of a woman’s life, her breasts change in size and volume as the skin {{envelope}} becomes inelastic, and the Cooper’s suspensory ligaments—which suspend the mammary gland high against the chest—become loose, and so cause the falling forward and <b>the</b> <b>sagging</b> of the breast and the nipple-areola complex (NAC). Moreover, additional to tissue prolapse, postpartum diminishment (involution) of the voluminous milk glands in the breast aggravates the looseness of the suspensory ligaments, and of the inelastic, overstretched skin envelope. Mastopexy corrects said degenerative physical changes, by elevating the (internal) parenchymal tissues, cutting and re-sizing the skin envelope, and transposing the nipple-areola complex higher upon the breast hemisphere. The degree of breast ptosis of each breast is determined by the position of the nipple-areola complex (NAC) upon the breast hemisphere; ptosis of the breast is measured with the modified Regnault ptosis grade scale.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers next {{traveled}} to San Diego {{for a series}} with the division-leading Padres. In the opener, Andre Ethier's two-run pinch hit single gave the Dodgers a 2–0 victory. The Dodgers offense continued to sputter the next day as they fell 6–1 to the Padres. In an effort to bolster <b>the</b> <b>sagging</b> offensive production, the Dodgers on July 28 acquired outfielder Scott Podsednik from the Kansas City Royals for two minor leaguers. However, the new addition went 0 for 3 in his debut and the Padres won a pitching duel 3–2 on a walk-off hit by Scott Hairston {{in the bottom of}} the ninth. The loss dropped the Dodgers seven games behind the Padres in the NL West. The Dodgers {{traveled to}} San Francisco for a series against the Giants. Despite a three-run rally in the ninth inning, the Dodgers lost the opener 6–5. In the second game, Chad Billingsley was again superb, pitching 6 scoreless innings, extending his scoreless innings streak to 21. However, the Dodger offense was again anemic and Jonathan Broxton suffered his fourth blown save of the season, allowing a two-run homer to Pat Burrell as the Dodgers lost 2–1.|$|E

500|$|The {{director}} of the original investigation stated that, [...] "the towers really did amazingly well. The terrorist aircraft didn't bring the buildings down; it was the fire which followed. It was proven that you could take out {{two thirds of the}} columns in a tower and the building would still stand." [...] The fires weakened the trusses supporting the floors, making the floors sag. <b>The</b> <b>sagging</b> floors pulled on the exterior steel columns causing the exterior columns to bow inward. With the damage to the core columns, the buckling exterior columns could no longer support the buildings, causing them to collapse. Additionally, the report found the towers' stairwells were not adequately reinforced to provide adequate emergency escape for people above the impact zones. NIST concluded that uncontrolled fires in 7WTC caused floor beams and girders to heat and subsequently [...] "caused a critical support column to fail, initiating a fire-induced progressive collapse that brought the building down".|$|E
30|$|The most {{predominant}} high-attenuation stripe {{can be seen}} beneath <b>the</b> <b>sag</b> pond {{that was}} bounded by faults A and B (Fig.  10). Why does the stripe there have the most predominant high-attenuation property? If the faults around <b>the</b> <b>sag</b> pond were originally formed as normal faults at the ocean floor spreading and then reactivated as strike-slip faults after the oblique subduction of PSP, all of the faults would show almost uniform attenuation property because those faults were formed by regionally consistent tectonics such as the spreading and the subduction. However, the high-attenuation stripe below <b>the</b> <b>sag</b> pond is outstanding among those around <b>the</b> <b>sag</b> pond. If this outstanding high-attenuation property was caused by weaker fault friction based on the previous laboratory measurement (Nagata et al. 2008), the faults A and B may be interpreted more active than the others at present. Our observation on the seismic profile, which the faults A and B are most predominant active faults around <b>the</b> <b>sag</b> pond, would support this interpretation. Thus, seismic attenuation property might be useful in discussing present activity of fault.|$|R

[...] Chris Monfette of IGN said that the fifth season of Grey's Anatomy was an improvement on the previous two seasons, attributing this {{in part to the}} introduction of [...] "fresh, new characters", Owen and Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw). He also referred to McKidd as [...] "the season 's best, most effective addition", adding: [...] Margaret Lyons of New York Magazine judged Hunt [...] "too sad" [...] for {{the first part of the}} ninth season. In 2010, Kevin McKidd was nominated for the Prism Award for Best Performance in a Drama Series' Multi-Episode Storyline, and won the award. In 2011, McKidd was nominated for the Prism Award for Best Performance in a Drama Series, for his work on Grey's Anatomy. McKidd was nominated, along with the rest of the Grey's Anatomy cast, for Best Drama Series at the 21st GLAAD Media Awards, in 2010.

40|$|The {{older and}} deeper {{hydrocarbon}} accumulations receive increasing attention across the world, providing more technical and commercial challenges to hydrocarbon exploration. We present {{a study of}} an asymmetrical, N-S striking intracratonic sag which developed across the Sichuan basin, south China, from Late Ediacaran to Early Cambrian times. <b>The</b> Mianyang-Changning intracratonic <b>sag</b> is ~ 50 [*]km wide, with its steepest part in the basin center. In particular the eastern margin shows its greatest steepness. Five episodes in the evolutions of <b>the</b> <b>sag</b> can be recognized. It begins in the Late Ediacaran with an uplift and erosion correlated to Tongwan movement. Initial extension occurred during the Early Cambrian Maidiping period, when more strata of the Maidiping Formation were deposited across <b>the</b> <b>sag.</b> Subsequently, maximum extension occurred during the Early Cambrian Qiongzhusi period that resulted in 450 – 1700 [*]m thick Maidiping-Canglangpu Formations being deposited in <b>the</b> <b>sag.</b> Then, <b>the</b> <b>sag</b> disappeared at <b>the</b> Longwangmiao period, as it was infilled by the sediments. <b>The</b> intracratonic <b>sag</b> has significant influence {{on the development of}} high-quality reservoirs in the Dengying and Longwangmiao Formations and source-rock of the Niutitang Formation.
