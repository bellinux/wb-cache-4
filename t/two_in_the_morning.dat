5|$|The action quickly {{revealed}} {{a breakdown in}} discipline amongst Benbow's captains. He had intended that the 64-gun HMS Defiance under Captain Richard Kirkby would lead the line of battle, but Kirkby was not maintaining his station. Benbow {{decided to take the}} lead himself, and the Breda pulled ahead, followed by the 50-gun HMS Ruby under Captain George Walton. The two maintained contact with the French throughout the night, but the other five ships refused to close. The chase ensued until 24 August, with only Benbow, Walton, and Samuel Vincent aboard HMS Falmouth making active efforts to bring the French to battle. At times, they bore the brunt of the fire of the entire squadron. The Ruby was disabled on 23 August, and Benbow ordered her to retire to Port Royal. The French resumed the action at <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> on 24 August, the entire squadron closing on the Breda from astern and pounding her. Benbow himself was hit by a chain-shot that broke his leg and he was carried below.|$|E

500|$|On 15 January 1944 an {{earthquake}} {{occurred in the}} town of San Juan, Argentina, killing some 10,000 people. In response, Perón, who was then the Secretary of Labour, established a fund to raise money to aid the victims. He devised a plan to have an [...] "artistic festival" [...] as a fundraiser, and invited radio and film actors to participate. After a week of fundraising, all participants met at a [...] held at Luna Park Stadium in Buenos Aires to benefit earthquake victims. It was at this gala, on 22 January 1944, that Eva Duarte first met Colonel Juan Perón. Eva promptly became the colonel's mistress. Eva referred to the day she met her future husband as her [...] "marvelous day". Fraser and Navarro write that Juan Perón and Eva left the gala together at around <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|E
500|$|One of the {{earliest}} accounts of an ascent of Helvellyn {{for the pleasure of}} doing so is contained in James Clarke's guidebook of 1787. He quotes the account of an unnamed gentleman from Penrith who wanted to eat his dinner on Midsummer Day while sitting in a snowdrift on top of Helvellyn. The man left home at <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> rode to Glencoyne and left his horse at a house in the valley there. He started to walk up the mountain at between four and five in the morning and after five hours hot and hard work he reached the snow and the summit. The snow was covered with dust so he had to dig for clean snow to eat with his dinner. He returned by a different route, reaching Glencoyne ten hours after leaving it. This story seems to reflect the colder climatic conditions of the eighteenth century, during the so-called [...] "Little Ice Age".|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Conway Studios in Los Angeles, {{and the band}} stayed at the Sunset Marquis Hotel during the sessions. [...] Nimrod took four months to record; Armstrong partially attributed the lengthy recording time to spending [...] "a little too much time" [...] playing pool and foosball during the sessions. [...] The recording schedule, which lasted from noon to <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> every day, became frustrating for the group members, who began drinking heavily. [...] Bassist Mike Dirnt recalled, [...] "One night {{one of us was}} walking down the halls knocking on people's doors while naked." [...] Another incident involved drummer Tre Cool throwing his hotel room television set out of his window. [...] Armstrong noted, [...] "There was a lot of glass. [...] You have to live that arrogant lifestyle every now and then." [...] To keep the band focused, Cavallo enlisted his father and manager Pat Magnarella to supervise the group.|$|E
500|$|On his hiring, Baker explained, [...] "I did the Dino De Laurentiis {{version of}} King Kong in 1976 {{and was always}} {{disappointed}} because I wasn't {{able to do it}} as realistically as I wanted. I thought Apes would {{be a good way to}} make up for that." [...] In addition to King Kong, Baker previously worked with designing ape makeup on , , and the 1998 remake of Mighty Joe Young. The makeup took 4.5 hours to apply and 1.5 hours to remove. Burton explained, [...] "it's like going to the dentist at <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and having people poke at you for hours. Then you wear an ape costume until nine at night." [...] Burton was adamant that the apes should be substantially [...] "more animal-like; flying through trees, climb walls, swing out of windows, and go ape shit when angry." [...] For a month and a half before shooting started, the actors who portrayed apes attended [...] "ape school". Industrial Light & Magic, Rhythm and Hues Studios and Animal Logic were commissioned for the visual effects sequences. Rick Heinrichs served as the production designer and Colleen Atwood did costume design.|$|E
500|$|It {{was about}} <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of August 27 that I {{was awakened by}} seeing a soldier {{at the side of}} my bed. I got up and dressed and went down to the barroom, where I saw my father {{standing}} in one corner with three British soldiers before him with muskets and bayonets fixed. The army was then lying in the field in front of the house.... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a camlet cloak over his regimentals. After asking for a glass of liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, [...] "I must have some one of you to show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass." [...] My father replied, [...] "We belong to the other side, General, and can’t serve you against our duty." [...] General Howe replied, [...] "That is alright; stick to your country, or stick to your principles, but Howard, you are my prisoner and must guide my men over the hill." [...] My father made some further objection, but was silenced by the general, who said, [...] "You have no alternative. If you refuse I shall shoot you through the head." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{scrutiny}} {{phase of}} the election is as follows: The cardinal electors proceed, in order of precedence, to take their completed ballots (which bear only {{the name of the}} individual voted for) to the altar, where the Scrutineers stand. Before casting the ballot, each cardinal elector takes a Latin oath, which translates to: [...] "I call as my witness Christ the Lord who will be my judge, that my vote is given to the one who before God I think should be elected." [...] If any cardinal elector is in the Chapel, but cannot proceed to the altar due to infirmity, the last Scrutineer may go to him and take his ballot after the oath is recited. If any cardinal elector is by reason of infirmity confined to his room, the Infirmarii go to their rooms with ballot papers and a box. Any such sick cardinals take the oath and then complete the ballot papers. When the Infirmarii return to the Chapel, the ballots are counted to ensure that their number matches with the number of ill cardinals; thereafter, they are deposited in the appropriate receptacle. This oath is taken by all cardinals as they cast their ballots. If no one is chosen on the first scrutiny, then a second scrutiny immediately follows. A maximum total of four scrutinies can be taken each day, <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and two in the afternoon.|$|E
500|$|Hoppus {{attributed}} the album's delay {{to the band}} learning to work by themselves without Finn, and both DeLonge and Hoppus expressed frustration during the sessions at the band's cabal of publicists, managers and attorneys (which DeLonge described as [...] "the absolute diarrhea of bureaucracy"). A result of the band's split was each members hiring his own attorney, and, during the sessions of Neighborhoods, the band had four managers. Later, {{it was revealed that}} DeLonge and Hoppus would go months without direct communication, only speaking through their managers. Hoppus moved to London with his family late in the recording process, also complicating matters. Under pressure, the band released a statement in April that effectively rescheduled all European tour dates due to the album's prolonged recording. The decision — a [...] "hugely expensive" [...] one — was protested by DeLonge but pushed forward by Barker, who felt the trio had made commitments to only tour with new material. [...] The biggest argument of the recording process ensued, which resulted in Geffen Records setting a July 31 deadline for the record amid concerns about the volatility of the band, explaining there would be penalties if the album was not turned in on time. DeLonge joked that, [...] "We'll probably actually drive it to the (Geffen) president's house at <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and hand it through his bedroom window at the last possible minute." [...] The band, as a whole, only entered the studio for [...] "one or two weeks" [...] following the release of the statement in the spring, with only three days dedicated to writing. Recording lasted through May and into the summer, and {{by the time of the}} July 31 deadline, the record was near completion and finally completed over August.|$|E

2500|$|In July 1972, aged 17, he had {{a summer}} job as a barman in the Grand Hotel in Tramore, County Waterford, working from six in the evening to <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> He spent his days on the beach, reading The Essential Hemingway, the copy of which he still professes to have, its [...] "pages stained with seawater." [...] The book {{developed}} in him a fascination with Spain, led to a wish to visit that country, and gave him [...] "an idea of prose as something glamorous, smart and shaped, {{and the idea of}} character in fiction as something oddly mysterious, worthy of sympathy and admiration, but also elusive. And more than anything, the sheer pleasure of the sentences and their rhythms, and the amount of emotion living in what was not said, what was between the words and the sentences." ...|$|E
2500|$|There were {{no signs}} of the {{garrison}} yielding. They treated Cromwell's summons lightly and miscalculated {{the power of his}} heavy guns. By the evening of 13 October two wide breaches had been effected, and at <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> it was resolved to storm the place at six, when the sky would be growing clear before the rising of the sun. The weary soldiers were directed to snatch a brief rest, but Cromwell spent part at least of the remainder of the night in meditation and prayer. He was verily persuaded that he was God's champion in the war against the strongholds of darkness, and as he figured to himself the idolaters and the idols behind the broken wall in front of him, the words, [...] "They that make them are like unto them, so is every one that trusteth in them", rose instinctively to his lips.|$|E

[...] You will often find him working until <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> in the office, with his little assistants from Harvard around him. [...] He never stops. [...] He's always meeting people, and talking". Claire Messud wrote in 2012 that she was impressed, when submitting reviews for novels to the Review, that Silvers had [...] "read the novel at hand, and sometimes with more sensitivity than I had ... he pointed out, delicately, that I'd attributed a quotation to the wrong character, and upon another occasion, that I'd summarized an event in a misleading way ... Bob is unfailingly generous and kind, someone who carefully suggests rather than commands alteration. He is an extraordinary editor in part because he is always respectful, of even the least of his contributors, or the least contribution." [...] Charles Rosen elaborated: ...|$|E
2500|$|Perri {{recorded}} the album in 33 days in two studios {{located on the}} same property, both running at the same time. She described the process as [...] "the best 33 {{days of my life}} and it was the worst 33 days of my life." [...] Describing the hectic conditions she was under while recording, she stated, [...] "I was running from studio one to studio three and I was running back and forth doing the vocals, the piano, the guitar, the harmonies, and the doubles.” Perri stated that sometimes they would record two songs in one day, forcing Perri to mentally prepare to sing about one relationship in 2007, then sing another other song with different emotions about a relationship in 2008. Perri stated that she was [...] "ripping [...] stitches" [...] to ensure that a certain song was sung with the right emotions, later adding that it took such an emotional toll on her that she would be driving home later that night crying at <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> forcing herself to pull over and drink a milkshake.|$|E
2500|$|Houston {{arrived at}} Tjilatjap 5 February and stayed until 10 February, {{when she left}} for Darwin to escort a convoy {{carrying}} troops to reinforce forces already defending Timor.

By eleven in the morning, the convoy was being shadowed by a Japanese flying boat that dropped some bombs without causing damage before departing. The next morning another shadowing aircraft had taken position, and before noon the convoy was attacked by bombers and flying boats in two waves. During the first attack, Mauna Loa suffered slight damage and two casualties, one killed and one wounded. Houstons fire showed no effects. During the second attack, Houston distinguished herself with a barrage which made her [...] "like a sheet of flame" [...] shooting down 7 of the 44 planes of the second wave. The convoy continued toward Timor for a few hours, with Houston launching a scout plane seeking the enemy position. ABDA suspected the presence of Japanese carriers, an imminent invasion of Timor, and a support fleet lying in wait and thus ordered the convoy back to Darwin, which it reached before noon on the 18 February.|$|E
