50|$|I-93 {{continues}} through the northern suburbs of Boston, coming in Woburn {{to a second}} intersection with Interstate 95 and Route 128, which run in a concurrency. Travelers going north can either change over to I-95 north to eventually reach Maine, or remain on I-93 toward New Hampshire. Farther north, in Andover, I-93 meets I-495, providing access to Worcester to the southwest and New Hampshire's seacoast region to the northeast. Just south of the state line, I-93 crosses the Merrimack River into Methuen, where it interchanges with Routes 110 and 113 at exit 46 {{just north of the}} river crossing. Prior to August 2016, the Route 110 and 113 junction beneath I-93 was a rotary, but current construction routes the highways straight under I-93. While two new ramps are being built at the interchange to complete the new partial cloverleaf format, there are <b>temporary</b> <b>signals</b> and inlets at the end of two existing ramps to serve traffic that will soon be using the new loop ramps. Work began in July 2014 on the project, and with the rotary now closed, demolition of the rotary will be underway in late 2016. The full project is scheduled for completion in June 2018. I-93 then interchanges with the western end of Route 213, a connector between I-93 and I-495. I-93 then crosses into New Hampshire after about 1 mi.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{nonlinear}} {{dynamics of}} in-line bubbles rising with coalescence in non-Newtonian Carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC) fluids was studied through the {{techniques such as}} the multiresolution signal decomposition and the chaotic time series analysis. The <b>temporary</b> <b>signals</b> of bubble passages collected by an optical sensing device at different heights were investigated by a 12 -level wavelet decomposition and the scalewise characteristics of bubble motion were extracted and analyzed. The chaotic time series analysis distinguished the periodicity or the deterministic chaos of bubble motion successsfully. The calculation of Kolmogorov entropy proves that in the ranges of experimental heights and gas flowrates, the bubble rising dynamics becomes more chaotic {{with the increase of}} height, and reaches the maximum chaotic extent in a certain height, while with the further increase of height, the chaotic extent decreases slowly. With the increase of gas flowrate, at the lower height, the bubble rising dynamics changes from periodicity to deterministic chaos, and at the higher heights it reaches the maximum chaotic extent in a certain gas flowrate; however, for both cases, it has little change in the higher gas flowrates. Moreover, with the increase of CMC concentration, the bubble rising dynamics becomes less chaotic when the height is beyond a certain value...|$|E

5|$|On 5 April 1957, {{the signal}} box was {{destroyed}} by a fire due to an electrical fault. The station was consequently put out of action.

The aim of this research is to study the effectiveness of shuttle-lane roadworks traffic management controls (i. e. operated by <b>temporary</b> traffic <b>signals)</b> on capacity, delays and safety. SIMSUR (SIMulation of Shuttle-lane Urban Roadworks) micro-simulation model is based on car-following and shuttle-lane rules, considers the various decisions undertaken when approaching <b>temporary</b> traffic <b>signals</b> at urban shuttle-lane roadworks (i. e. tailgating, crossing through amber or even violating the red light).

40|$|Modern mission {{critical}} digital systems often require {{some form of}} fault tolerance to achieve adequate functionality in their operating environments. In the presence of radiation, particle strikes can cause <b>temporary</b> <b>signal</b> errors in ICs. Particle strikes that directly affect memory are known as Single Event Upsets (SEUs), while strikes that affect combinational logic are called Single Event Transients (SETs). SETs are becoming more of an issue as technology improves, as the properties that masked these faults in the past are decreasing in influence. In this paper we compare multiple approaches to hardening integrated circuits against SETs. These approaches include modified DICE, TMR, and delay-based schemes. The metrics for comparison are clock period (with worst-case SEU/SET), energy consumption, and circuit complexity (area) requirements. Each approach possesses unique strengths and weaknesses, and so {{the best choice for}} a given system is dependent on the circumstances of the situation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—this paper {{presents}} a newly developed micro-simulation model for shuttle-lane urban roadworks (which is closing one lane {{of a single}} carriageway road while leaving the other for use by both directions in an alternate one-way working) focusing on issues relating to <b>Temporary</b> Traffic <b>Signals</b> (TTS) control and its effectiveness. The model deals with general {{as well as more}} specific drivers' behavior, such as following too closely (tailgating), effect of dilemma zone and non-compliance with <b>temporary</b> traffic <b>signals.</b> The main criteria of this model are governed by the application of car following and shuttle-lane rules. The model has been calibrated and validated using real traffic data taken from observed urban shuttle-lane roadworks sites for both Fixed Time (FT) and Vehicle Actuated (VA) TTS. Modified signal settings and various MVD (Microwave Vehicle Detector) detection ranges were also assessed in terms of their impact on capacity (throughput) and delays.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a simple and}} effective concept for aiding the signal acquistion of a GPS receiver in sounding rocket applications. A segmented, low-order polynomial representation of the norminal flight path is employed to provide the receiver with approximate position and velocity values of the host vehicle. These are used for an open-loop Doppler and visibility prediction, which in turn assists the channel allocation and code search. The prosposed concept has been implemented in the 12 -channel GPS Orion receiver, which employs Mitel`s GP 2000 chipset and suports firmware modifications via the Architect developer kit. Using hardware-in-the-loop simulations in a GPS signal simulator testbed, the modified receiver`s robustness against <b>temporary</b> <b>signal</b> losses has been demonstrated. While the unaided receiver is essentially unable to reacquire signals in case of intermitted signals, the position-velocity aiding allows a stable and reliable operation both during the boost and free-flight phase. Test flights on actual sounding rockets are currently planned for spring (Kiruna) and summer (Alcantara, VS 30 /Orion) of 2001...|$|R
