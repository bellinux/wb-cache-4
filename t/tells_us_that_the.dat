5|$|As is {{discussed}} below, {{the reason for}} the delay was probably simply that neither the Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially. This then raises the question of why the battle occurred when it did. Herodotus explicitly <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Greeks attacked the Persians (and the other sources confirm this), {{but it is not clear}} why they did this before the arrival of the Spartans. There are two main theories to explain this.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians, doubting that a Persian {{commander}} {{would have}} sabotaged his own invasion, have suggested several other possible scenarios. It is, however, {{impossible to know}} exactly how the Naxians {{became aware of the}} invasion, but undoubtedly they were aware, and began to make preparations. Herodotus <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Naxians had previously had no inkling of the expedition, but that when news arrived they brought everything in from the fields, gathered enough food with which to survive a siege and reinforced their walls.|$|E
5|$|The Greek forces were, {{as agreed}} by the Allied congress, under the overall command of Spartan royalty {{in the person of}} Pausanias, who was the regent for Leonidas' young son, Pleistarchus, his cousin. Diodorus <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Athenian {{contingent}} was under the command of Aristides; it is probable that the other contingents also had their leaders. Herodotus tells us in several places that the Greeks held council during the prelude to the battle, implying that decisions were consensual and that Pausanias did not have the authority to issue direct orders to the other contingents. This style of leadership contributed to the way events unfolded during the battle itself. For instance, in the period immediately before the battle, Pausanias was unable to order the Athenians to join up with his forces, and thus the Greeks fought the battle completely separated from each other.|$|E

25|$|This beta {{function}} <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> coupling {{increases with}} increasing energy scale, and QED becomes strongly coupled at high energy. In fact, the coupling apparently becomes infinite at some finite energy, {{resulting in a}} Landau pole. However, one cannot expect the perturbative beta function to give accurate results at strong coupling, {{and so it is}} likely that the Landau pole is an artifact of applying perturbation theory in a situation where it is no longer valid.|$|E
25|$|Although the Robertson–Seymour theorem extends {{these results}} to {{arbitrary}} minor-closed graph families, {{it is not}} a complete substitute for these results, because it does not provide an explicit description of the obstruction set for any family. For example, it <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> set of toroidal graphs has a finite obstruction set, but it does not provide any such set. The complete set of forbidden minors for toroidal graphs remains unknown, but contains at least 16000 graphs.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in nature}} the {{electromagnetic}} field is coupled to charged particles, such as electrons. The QFT describing {{the interactions of}} photons and charged particles is quantum electrodynamics (QED), and this theory is not scale-invariant. We can see this from the QED beta-function. This <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> electric charge (which is the coupling parameter in the theory) increases with increasing energy. Therefore, while the quantized electromagnetic field without charged particles is scale-invariant, QED is not scale-invariant.|$|E

25|$|Diodorus <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> newly founded city of Heraclea rose {{rapidly to}} prosperity, but was {{destroyed}} by the Carthaginians, through jealousy of its increasing power. When this took place is uncertain. It was probably related by Diodorus in his 10th book, which is now lost. He {{makes no mention of}} any such event during the First Sicilian War (480BC) when it might otherwise be supposed to have occurred. An inscription from the temple of Athena Lindia of Lindos on Rhodes attests the dedication of an ivory palladium as spoils from an undated victory of the Agrigentines over Minoa.|$|E
25|$|Robert {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} clerics in the reign of King Alexander I of Scotland (Alaxandair mac Maíl Coluim). He was appointed as the first Prior of Scone, the flagship Augustinian monastic establishment of Alexander's reign. This may have happened as early as 1114, and Walter Bower <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new priory was dedicated by Thurgot, then bishop of Cell Rígmonaid. As Turgot left Scotland in 1115, no later date would be possible if Bower is to be believed. Many historians have rejected this date, because the Augustinian Rule was not instituted at Nostell until 1119, but as Kenneth Veitch points out, the date of the formal institution of the Rule is little guide to the actual activities of the monastic establishment. Moreover, the year 1114 just happened to be the year in which Alexander was present in England in the service of his overlord, King Henry I of England.|$|E
25|$|In {{some places}} in India, the corpse may {{be carried out}} of the house from the side door, rather than the front door so that the {{deceased}} does not find her way back in the house. If a woman dies during childbirth or during her menstrual cycle, her “corpse is anointed with five different products of the cow and special texts are recited.” In the Hilly regions, the place where a pregnant woman died is carefully scraped and the earth removed. The spot is then sown with mustard (sarson), which is also sprinkled along the road traversed by the corpse {{on its way to the}} burial ground. The reason behind this is that the mustard blossoms in the world of the dead, and the sweet smell pleases the spirit and keeps her content, so that she does not long to revisit her earthly home; secondly, the Churel rises from her grave at nightfall and seeks to return to her friends but when she sees the minute grains of the mustard scattered abroad and stoops to pick it up, and while she is engaged, the sun rises and she is unable to visit her home. This story also <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Churel usually only comes out during the night.|$|E
