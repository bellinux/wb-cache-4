40|$|Highly ordered porous alumina <b>through-hole</b> masks were {{fabricated}} on a substrate {{by combining}} two-layer anodization with subsequent <b>through-holing</b> by selective etching. This process allowed the fabrication of porous alumina masks without {{an increase in}} pore size during the etching performed for <b>through-holing.</b> Additionally, the process contributed to improved operability {{in the setting of}} the masks on substrates because the second anodizing layer acts as a supporting layer for the handling of the mask.

50|$|A {{footprint}} or {{land pattern}} is {{the arrangement of}} pads (in surface-mount technology) or <b>through-holes</b> (in through-hole technology) used to physically attach and electrically connect a component to a printed circuit board.

50|$|CT2 {{had four}} burners of about 1,600 watts each, {{measured}} by calorimetry. The range top was a Pyroceram ceramic sheet {{surrounded by a}} stainless-steel bezel, upon which four magnetic sliders adjusted four corresponding potentiometers set below. That design, using no <b>through-holes,</b> made the range proof against spills. The electronic section was made in four identical modules cooled by fans.|$|E
25|$|Often, <b>through-hole</b> and surface-mount {{construction}} must {{be combined}} {{in a single}} assembly because some required components are available only in surface-mount packages, while others are available only in <b>through-hole</b> packages. Another reason to use both methods is that <b>through-hole</b> mounting can provide needed strength for components likely to endure physical stress, while components {{that are expected to}} go untouched will take up less space using surface-mount techniques.|$|R

5000|$|A PCB {{may need}} varying amounts of solder paste {{to be applied}} {{depending}} upon the design and size of components. Applying a uniform maximum level of solder {{may not be a}} good solution in this case, as these stencils often find use when [...] "pin and paste" [...] technology (i.e., printing solder paste into <b>through-holes</b> to avoid wave soldering) and components of significantly different pitch are used in the same PWB. For this purpose, to achieve a varying solder amount, step down stencils are used.|$|E
50|$|A pin rail, {{originally}} a wood beam, is typically a large-diameter round steel tube with vertical <b>through-holes</b> that accept belaying pins {{used in a}} hemp rigging system. Depending on the pin rail design, the pins may be removable or permanently fixed to the rail. Pin rails are typically installed permanently at the onstage edge of the fly gallery(ies), extending from the proscenium wall to upstage wall, sometimes in a stacked (rail over rail) arrangement. Mobile pin rails may also be used and are bolted down to the stage deck where needed.|$|E

25|$|<b>Through-hole</b> PCB {{technology}} {{almost completely}} replaced earlier electronics assembly {{techniques such as}} point-to-point construction. From the second generation of computers in the 1950s until surface-mount technology became popular in the late 1980s, every component on a typical PCB was a <b>through-hole</b> component.|$|R

50|$|Reflow {{soldering}} is {{the most}} common method of attaching surface mount components to a circuit board, although it can also be used for <b>through-hole</b> components by filling the holes with solder paste and inserting the component leads through the paste. Because wave soldering can be simpler and cheaper, reflow is not generally used on pure <b>through-hole</b> boards. When used on boards containing a mix of SMT and THT components, <b>through-hole</b> reflow allows the wave soldering step to be eliminated from the assembly process, potentially reducing assembly costs.|$|R
50|$|Flex {{circuits}} {{having three}} or more layers of conductors are known as multilayer flex circuits. Commonly the layers are interconnected by means of plated through holes, though {{this is not a}} requirement of the definition for it is possible to provide openings to access lower circuit level features. The layers of the multilayer flex circuit {{may or may not be}} continuously laminated together throughout the construction with the obvious exception of the areas occupied by plated <b>through-holes.</b> The practice of discontinuous lamination is common in cases where maximum flexibility is required. This is accomplished by leaving unbonded the areas where flexing or bending is to occur.|$|E
5000|$|Screws: Threads {{have a high}} {{surface area}} and tend to [...] "trap" [...] gases, and therefore, are avoided. Blind holes are {{especially}} avoided, due to the trapped gas {{at the base of}} the screw and slow venting through the threads, which is commonly known as a [...] "virtual leak". This can be mitigated by designing components to include <b>through-holes</b> for all threaded connections, or by using vented screws (which have a hole drilled through their central axis or a notch along the threads). Vented Screws allow trapped gases to flow freely from the base of the screw, eliminating virtual leaks and speeding up the pump-down process.|$|E
50|$|The disk of a {{pseudorandom}} encoder has an evenly spaced notch design just as {{an incremental}} encoder to measure distance. A second track of code is used to find the position just like an absolute encoder; however, an absolute encoder tells position from reading from multiple parallel tracks while a pseudorandom encoder uses one single track. This aspect allows pseudorandom rotary encoders to have smaller diameters and larger <b>through-holes.</b> To know its position, the encoder must first move a certain distance to read the code. This distance is generally small, about 1-2 degrees for rotary encoders and 1 mm for linear encoders, though this idiosyncrasy does hinder its usefulness in some applications such as track-balls since position is not immediately known when the system starts.|$|E

The HA beads with a <b>through-hole</b> were fabricated to have an oblate shape to keep an opening of the <b>through-hole</b> contact with 2 -D cultured cells layer. The seeding was performed by leaving the HA beads in a culture dish with MG 63 cells in culture. The <b>through-hole</b> trapped MG 63 cells in a sheet form by 1 -day seeding. After 5 days, the number of trapped cells increased about nine fold, forming cell clumps in the <b>through-hole.</b> The seeding of the HA beads was considered an easy and practical method to provide HA/Cell hybrids that would realize active bone forming orthopedic treatment...|$|R

50|$|The <b>through-holes</b> are {{of various}} {{shapes and sizes}} and are used to hold, support or back up a hot bar of metal for further shaping. Operations {{performed}} on a swage block include {{but are not limited}} to bending, cutting, punching and forming. The sides are scalloped to present formed shapes for forging operations. Shapes are for example the curve of a wheel, which could be used to finish a wheel rim, using a suitable hammer. Other shapes, such as the half hexagon, can be used with a matching top swage to form a hexagonal cross-section on a bar. The various shapes around the edge of the swage block all have corresponding shapes in the form of top swages to shape iron bar into various sections.|$|E
5000|$|Borescopes are {{commonly}} used in the visual inspection of aircraft engines, aeroderivative industrial gas turbines, steam turbines, diesel engines, and automotive and truck engines. Gas and steam turbines require particular attention because of safety and maintenance requirements. Borescope inspection of engines {{can be used to}} prevent unnecessary maintenance, which can become extremely costly for large turbines. They are also used in manufacturing of machined or cast parts to inspect critical interior surfaces for burrs, surface finish or complete <b>through-holes.</b> Other common uses include forensic applications in law enforcement and building inspection, and in gunsmithing for inspecting the interior bore of a firearm. In World War II, primitive rigid borescopes were used to examine the interior bores (hence [...] "bore" [...] scope) of large guns for defects.|$|E

The assembly can be glued together (if student divers are closely supervised as the release feature is not as forgiving) or held together by internal shock cord for safety and convenience reasons; allowing dislocation of the joints for compact storage. The unconnected corner is generally deployed as {{the high point of}} the Hover Station and it allows a diver to escape upwards if unable to pass through the 'hoop'.|$|E

50|$|Flat no-leads {{packages}} such as quad-flat no-leads (QFN) and dual-flat no-leads (DFN) {{physically and}} electrically connect integrated circuits to printed circuit boards. Flat no-leads, {{also known as}} micro leadframe (MLF) and SON (small-outline no leads), is a surface-mount technology, one of several package technologies that connect ICs to the surfaces of PCBs without <b>through-holes.</b> Flat no-lead is a near chip scale plastic encapsulated package made with a planar copper lead frame substrate. Perimeter lands on the package bottom provide electrical connections to the PCB.Flat no-lead packages include an exposed thermal pad to improve heat transfer out of the IC (into the PCB). Heat transfer can be further facilitated by metal vias in the thermal pad. The QFN package {{is similar to the}} quad-flat package, and a ball grid array.|$|E
50|$|Three major {{kinds of}} vias {{are shown in}} right figure. The basic steps of making a PCB are: making the {{substrate}} material and stacking it in layers; through-drilling of plating the vias; and copper trace patterning using photolithography and etching. With this standard procedure, possible via configurations are limited to <b>through-holes.</b> Depth-controlled drilling techniques such as using lasers can allow for more varied via types. PCB manufacturing typically starts with a so-called core, a basic double-sided PCB. Layers beyond the first two are stacked from this basic building block. If two more layers are consecutively stacked from bottom of core, {{you can have a}} 1-2 via, a 1-3 via and a through hole. Each type of via is made by drilling at each stacking stage. If one layer is stacked on top of the core and other is stacked from the bottom, the possible via configurations are 1-3, 2-3 and through hole. The user must gather information about the PCB manufacturer's allowed methods of stacking and possible vias. For cheaper boards, only through holes are made and antipad (or clearance) is placed on layers which are supposed not to be contacted to vias.|$|E

The micro-pillars were formed by the capillary force that draws PDMS into the <b>through-holes</b> of the PMMA mold. The tilt angles of the micro-pillars depend on the tilt angles of the <b>through-holes</b> in the mold, and the concave and convex micro-lens tip shapes of the PDMS micro-pillars can be modified by changing the surface wettability of the PMMA <b>through-holes...</b>|$|E
