5|$|After Poehler {{agreed to}} play the lead, they decided the show would revolve around an optimistic bureaucrat in small-town government. The idea was partly {{inspired}} by the portrayal of local politics on the HBO drama series The Wire, {{as well as the}} renewed interest in and optimism about politics stemming from the 2008 United States presidential election. The staff was also drawn to the idea of building a show around a female relationship, namely Leslie Knope and Ann Perkins. Reports that Daniels and Schur were developing a show together led to press speculation that it would, in fact, be a spin-off of The Office. The producers insisted their new series would be entirely independent. Nevertheless, their concept for it shared several elements with The Office, particularly the mockumentary approach, which allows the actors <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>and</b> directly address the camera. The new show would also include documentary-style interviews, in which the characters speak one-on-one with the camera crew about the day's events. Again as with The Office, the new series would be scripted but improvisation would be encouraged among the actors.|$|E

25|$|The new duchess was adored by {{the poor}} and less {{fortunate}} tenants on her husband's estate, whom she visited and to whom she provided assistance. She later became involved with other philanthropic projects and was particularly interested in those that affected mothers and children. She was also a social success with royalty and the aristocracy of Britain. However, given the ill-fitting match between the duke and his wife, {{it was only a}} matter of time before their marriage was in name only. The duchess eventually was smitten by her husband's handsome cousin, the Hon. Reginald Fellowes (the liaison did not last, to the relief of Fellowes's parents), while the duke fell under the spell of Gladys Marie Deacon, an eccentric American of little money but, like Consuelo, dazzling <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>and</b> of considerable intellect. The Marlboroughs separated in 1906, divorced in 1921, and the marriage was annulled, at the duke's request and with Consuelo's assent, on 19 August 1926.|$|E
25|$|Rosa {{was exposed}} to comics {{at a very young}} age, as his 11-years-older sister was a comics hoarder, and had {{thousands}} of comics for Don <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>and</b> later read. Rosa began drawing comics before being able to write. Until he attended Saint Xavier High School in Louisville, Kentucky, his featured characters were a large cast of stick figures featured in comedy-adventures like the Barks comics and old movies Rosa enjoyed most. He never tried to draw more than stick figures, because the drawings, for him, were illustrations to get the story told. Only the story was important to him, not the actual drawings. His favorite comic books growing up were Uncle Scrooge by Western Publishing and Little Lulu comics from Dell Comics (Western Publishing), and his sister's collection of MAD comics and magazines. When he was 12 years old he also discovered and enjoyed the Superman titles by DC Comics of the editor Mort Weisinger period, drawn mostly by his favorite Superman artists Curt Swan and Kurt Schaffenberger. Shortly after starting to collect Superman comics he started to trade the collection of his older sister for Superman Comics. Since a comic book shop in his area traded two old comics for one new, he only had two Duck comics left from his sister's collection by the 1970s, one of them being The Golden Helmet. When he became a serious collector of older comics, he particularly enjoyed the classic E.C. horror and science fiction comics of the 1950s, Will Eisner's The Spirit, Walt Kelly's Pogo, and most comics of the 1940s onward.|$|E

500|$|Povenmire {{was born}} in San Diego, California on September 18, 1963, {{and grew up in}} the city of Mobile, Alabama. A child prodigy, he began drawing at age two; {{by the time he was}} ten, his work was {{displayed}} in local art shows. His first efforts in animation included a series of flip books that he produced in his school text books. As a child, Povenmire considered animator Chuck Jones his hero; in a 2009 interview, he stated that [...] "every drawing he [...] did was beautiful <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>and</b> had so much energy in it". Hayao Miyazaki was also an early influence.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{graphics}} received near-unanimous praise. Game Revolution {{said its}} [...] "brilliant" [...] graphics {{were among the}} best in gaming and Next Generation said the graphics were the best in any PC RPG. Computer Games said it was the most attractive PC game at the time, ArsTechnica said it was the best game <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>and</b> watch since The Last Express (1997), and PC Gamer said, [...] "there has never been a more beautifully created RPG". The level design and environments were praised for the level of detail, providing a brooding, atmospheric aesthetic with [...] "painstaking" [...] detail. Reviewers also made positive comments about the game's lighting effects. Conversely, Computer Gaming World (CGW) said that while the game was attractive, the visuals were superficial and failed to emphasize the game's horror elements. They were also critical of the third-person in-game camera positioning, claiming that it obscured the area {{directly in front of the}} player and did not allow the player to look upwards.|$|E
500|$|Derek Yu from The Indie Games Source {{compared}} {{the game with}} Portal and stated that Chung was able to develop [...] "an impeccable flair for graphic design" [...] while manufacturing Gravity Bone. He concluded that the game is [...] "bursting with delicious color, and features blocky-headed characters that are infinitely more interesting <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>and</b> interact with than the frightening Realdolls game players are often forced to contend with in modern FPS's." [...] Yu elaborated that it had [...] "enough panache in its two levels to make it somewhat of an indie sleeper hit {{of the end of}} 2008." [...] An editor from The Refined Geek was pleased with Gravity Bone and its sequel, Thirty Flights of Loving, awarding them each a score of 8 out of 10 and stating, [...] "the enjoyment from these games comes from noticing all the subtle environmental clues and then using your imagination to draw the connecting dots." [...] The editor commented that both games highlight story elements over graphics and technical innovations, saying each game's [...] "true strength comes from its ability to tell a story in the extremely short time frame." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 16, 1953 {{against the}} St. Louis Browns (the second {{game of the}} season, and Chicago's home opener) Pierce pitched his second one-hitter, a 1–0 victory in which he allowed only a seventh-inning double by Bobby Young; the White Sox gained only two singles in the contest, and scored on a walk, {{sacrifice}} hit, error and sacrifice fly. Pierce was chosen to start the All-Star Game for the AL – the first White Sox pitcher ever to do so – and allowed only one hit through three innings (a single by Stan Musial). Boston Red Sox star Ted Williams recalled of the game: [...] "It was a hot day at Crosley Field and I remember being so concerned for little Billy Pierce of the White Sox. Billy probably threw harder than anybody for a guy his size, he had a real big delivery, nice <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> <b>and</b> he had overcome a lot. I understand he had had epilepsy, and I was really pulling for him. He was a nervous little guy, {{and here he was}} starting his first All-Star game in a bandbox park that's tough to pitch in, and against Robin Roberts to boot. Pierce held them {{in the palm of his}} hand that day. He threw the ball right by everybody." ...|$|E

500|$|James Montgomery from MTV {{said that}} while the video surpassed her most iconic clips in terms of sheer spectacle, it still {{displayed}} a level on restraint in its themes. He summarized the review by saying it was one of her all-time best videos, adding that [...] "there's genuine art to it, which makes it both beautiful <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>and</b> powerful." [...] Montgomery also found that the video was inspired by the Graeae, iamamiwhoami, Kanye West's short film Runaway, the music videos for Robyn's [...] "Indestructible", Madonna's [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] and [...] "Die Another Day", The Matrix franchise, Mortal Kombat, The Rocky Horror Picture Show and the Cam de Leon painting Ocular Orifice, which served as one of several covers of the Tool album Ænima. Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone called it [...] "a total visual assault", and added that it [...] "is a mix of everything we've come to expect from Britney", such as sexy costumes and elaborate choreography. Aaron Parsley of People believed that the fight sequence was the highlight of the video, but dismissed the product placement. Bill Lamb of About.com said the video was visually stellar, although he added that it was [...] "difficult to know" [...] if it would [...] "match the impact of" [...] clips such as [...] "Baby One More Time" [...] and [...] "Toxic". Willa Paskin of New York deemed it as [...] "a high-energy, professional, dance video", but stated that [...] " [...] make up for the basic fact that she isn’t in the dancing shape, or really, performing shape she once was." ...|$|E
500|$|William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer praised it as [...] "one of Pixar's most {{imaginative and}} {{thoroughly}} appealing movies ever" [...] and Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "a work of American art as classic {{as it is}} modern." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times [...] gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying that the movie [...] "is great <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>and</b> a lot of fun, but somehow lacks the extra push of the other Pixar films. Maybe that's because there's less at stake here, and no child-surrogate to identify with." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Fueled with plenty of humor, action, heartfelt drama, and amazing new technical feats, Cars is a high octane delight for moviegoers of all ages." [...] Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Existing both in turbo-charged today and the gentler '50s, straddling the realms of Pixar styling and old Disney heart, this new-model Cars is an instant classic." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety gave the film a negative review, saying [...] "Despite representing another impressive technical achievement, it's the least visually interesting of the computer-animation boutique's movies, and -- in an ironic twist for a story about auto racing -- drifts slowly through its semi-arid midsection." [...] Robert Wilonsky of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "What ultimately redeems Cars from turning out a total lemon is its soul. Lasseter loves these animated inanimate objects as though they were kin, and it shows in every beautifully rendered frame." [...] Ella Taylor of L.A. Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Cars cheerfully hitches cutting-edge animation to a folksy narrative plugging friendship, community and a Luddite mistrust of high tech." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Hara's {{first major}} film role {{was that of}} Mary Yellen in Jamaica Inn (1939), {{directed}} by Alfred Hitchcock and co-starring Laughton. O'Hara portrayed the innkeeper's niece, an orphan who goes {{to live with her}} aunt and uncle at a Cornish tavern, a heroine which she describes as [...] "torn between the love of her family and her love for a lawman in disguise". Laughton insisted that she change her name to the shorter [...] "O'Mara" [...] or [...] "O'Hara", and she eventually decided on the latter after expressing contempt at both. [...] When she said [...] "I like Maureen Fitzsimons and I want to keep it", Laughton replied with, [...] "Very well, you're Maureen O'Hara." [...] (O'Hara would later say that [...] "nobody would ever get [...] straight.") [...] O'Hara noted that Laughton had always wanted a daughter of his own, and treated her as such, and she later stated that Laughton's death in 1962 was like losing a parent. She worked well under Hitchcock, professing to have [...] "never experienced the strange feeling of detachment with Hitchcock that many other actors claimed to have felt while working with him." [...] On the contrary, Laughton was engaged in a bitter battle with Hitchcock throughout the production and resented many of Hitchcock's ideas, including changing the nature of the villain from the novel. Though Jamaica Inn is generally seen by critics and the director himself as one of his weakest films, O'Hara was praised, with one critic stating [...] "the newcomer, Maureen O'Hara is charming <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>and</b> distinct promise as an actress". Seeing the film was an eyeopener for O'Hara and change in self-perception, having always seen herself as a tomboy and realizing that on screen she was a woman of great beauty to others. When she returned to Ireland briefly after the film was completed it dawned on her that life {{would never be the same}} again, and she was hurt when she attempted to make pleasant conversation to some local girls and they rejected her advances, considering her to be very arrogant.|$|E
