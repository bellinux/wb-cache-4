25|$|Bennett parked her Cadillac {{convertible}} {{in the lot}} at {{the back}} of the MCA offices, at Santa Monica Boulevard and Rexford Drive, across the street from the Beverly Hills Police Department, and she and Lang drove off in his car. Meanwhile, her husband Walter Wanger drove by at about 2:30p.m. and noticed his wife's car parked there. Half an hour later, he again saw her car there and stopped to wait.

As she started the engine, turned on the headlights and prepared to drive away, Lang leaned on the car, with both hands raised <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and talked to her.|$|E
25|$|Entire {{society was}} then in turmoil and Ramtanu Lahiri {{was going through}} all that. However, certain events in his {{personal}} life affected him seriously. First was the death of two of his brothers, one younger and the other elder. His elder brother had by then risen {{to the position of}} a sheristadar, a remarkable achievement in those days. The death of his elder brother brought on the entire responsibility of the family on <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Second, two of his wives had died and he married a third time. Third, the death of David Hare in 1842. It was a tremendous shock for Ramtanu Lahiri. He revered him as his own father. Throughout his life, he never failed to gather his friends and pay respect to him at his grave on his death anniversary every year.|$|E

2500|$|Morley later {{returned}} to New Mexico where he operated an extensive cattle and sheep ranch at Datil, New Mexico, {{known as the}} [...] "Drag A ranch." [...] Morley reportedly owned 200 sections of 640 acres each and [...] "controlled several times that number because of control of watering places, and additional sections under Forest Service permits." [...] Morley {{was one of the}} leading figures in western New Mexico. [...] He was reported to be a [...] "story teller of no mean ability," [...] a skilled hunter, and [...] "a hated foe of cattle rustlers." [...] An account published in the Albuquerque Journal described him as follows:"He was a man of picturesque appearance with a reddish beard that he wore in styles to suit his whim. [...] Three years ago , in an effort to procure aid for New Mexico livestock men who had lost heavily in the postwar period, he let his hair grow <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> and his beard to his waist, and marched in the inaugural parade at Washington, where he attracted wide attention and publicity." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Adrianople `Abdu’l-Bahá was {{regarded}} as the sole comforter of his family – in particular to his mother. At this point `Abdu'l-Bahá was known by the Bahá'ís as [...] "the Master", and by non-Bahá'ís as `Abbás Effendi ("Effendi" [...] signifies [...] "Sir"). It was in Adrianople that Bahá’u’lláh referred to his son as [...] "the Mystery of God". The title of [...] "Mystery of God" [...] symbolises, according to Bahá'ís, that `Abdu'l-Bahá is not a manifestation of God but how a [...] "person of `Abdu'l-Bahá the incompatible characteristics of a human nature and superhuman knowledge and perfection have been blended and are completely harmonized". `Abdu'l-Bahá {{was at this point}} noted for having black hair which flowed <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> large blue eyes, rose-through-alabaster coloured skin and a fine nose. Bahá'u'lláh gave his son many other titles such as Ghusn-i-A'zam (meaning [...] "Mightiest Branch" [...] or [...] "Mightier Branch"), the [...] "Branch of Holiness", [...] "the Center of the Covenant" [...] and the apple of his eye. `Abdu'l-Bahá ("the Master") was devastated when hearing the news that he and his family were to be exiled separately from Bahá'u'lláh. It was, according to Bahá'ís, through his intercession that the idea was reverted and the family were allowed to be exiled together.|$|E

2500|$|Triple H {{received}} one final {{shot at the}} World Heavyweight Championship, on the July 26, 2004 episode of Raw in an Iron Man match. Earlier that night, Orton won a number-one contender battle royal for the World Heavyweight Championship so a title match between Triple H and Orton could have taken place at SummerSlam. However, Eugene interfered in the Iron Man match and helped Benoit take the lead and retain the title in the final seconds. As a result, the main event of SummerSlam was a title match between Benoit and Orton. At SummerSlam, Orton pinned Benoit to become the new World Heavyweight Champion and the youngest World Champion in WWE history to date. On the August 16, 2004 episode of Raw, Orton {{was kicked out of}} Evolution following a successful defense of the title against Chris Benoit. Batista hoisted Orton on <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> {{in what appeared to be}} a celebration, but following the thumbs down from Triple H, the group proceeded to attack Orton. The next week on Raw, Triple H demanded that Randy Orton [...] "make the right decision" [...] and give him the World Heavyweight Championship belt. In return he would forget Orton ever existed. Orton refused and then spat in Triple H’s face. Afterwards, backstage Triple H was livid and demanded Eric Bischoff resolve this. Bischoff said he would and promised Triple H a match against Orton at Unforgiven for the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
2500|$|Kobolds {{who live}} in human homes are {{generally}} depicted as humanlike, dressed as peasants, and standing about as tall as a four-year-old child. A legend recorded by folklorist Joseph Snowe from a place called Alte Burg in 1839 tells of a creature [...] "in {{the shape of a}} short, thick-set being, neither boy nor man, but akin to the condition of both, garbed in a party-coloured loose surcoat, and wearing a high-crowned hat with a broad brim on his diminutive head." [...] The kobold Hödekin (also known as Hüdekin and Hütchen) of Hildesheim wore a little hat down over his face (Hödekin means [...] "little hat"). Another type of kobold known as the Hütchen is said to be [...] tall, with red hair and beard, and clad in red or green clothing and a red hat and may even be blind. [...] Yet other tales describe kobolds appearing as herdsmen looking for work and little, wrinkled old men in pointed hoods. [...] Some kobolds resemble small children. According to dramatist and novelist X. B. Saintine, kobolds are the spirits of dead children and often appear with a knife that represents the means by which they were put to death. Heinzelmann, a kobold from the folklore of Hudermühlen Castle in the region of Lüneburg, appeared as a beautiful boy with blond, curly hair <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> and dressed in a red silk coat. His voice was [...] "soft and tender like that of a boy or maiden." ...|$|E
