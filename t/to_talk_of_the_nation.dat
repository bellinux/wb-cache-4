6000|$|What evil results now to this country, {{taken at}} large, {{from the actual}} {{existence}} of the National Debt? I never could get a plain and practical answer to that question. I do not advert to the past loss of capital, although {{it is hard to}} see how that capital can be said to have been unproductive, which produces, in the defence of the nation itself, the conditions of the permanence and productivity of all other capital. As to taxation to pay the interest, how can the country suffer by a process, under which the money is never one minute out of the pockets of the people? You may just as well say that a man is weakened by the circulation of his blood. There may, certainly, be particular local evils and grievances resulting from the mode of taxation or collection; but how can that debt be in any proper sense a burthen to the nation, which the nation owes to itself, and to no one but itself? It is a juggle <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> owing the capital or the interest to the stockholders; it owes to itself only. Suppose the interest to be owing to the Emperor of Russia, and then you would feel the difference of a debt in the proper sense. It is really and truly nothing more in effect than so much moneys or money's worth, raised annually by the state for the purpose of quickening industry.[1] ...|$|E
60|$|They {{were all}} curious {{to hear of}} Washington, but he was more {{inclined}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crops and the cattle.|$|R
60|$|Gwendolen. How absurd <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{equality}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sexes! Where {{questions of}} self-sacrifice are concerned, men are infinitely beyond us.|$|R
50|$|Cf. <b>the</b> four Provinces <b>of</b> Ireland - where {{reference}} to the ancient provinces is used <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire Irish island.|$|R
60|$|Then Margaret {{was again}} silent. She {{by no means}} wished <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story, if he would only leave it alone.|$|R
60|$|Going out of Immering {{they began}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> future. And {{for the very}} young lover there is no future but the {{immediate}} future.|$|R

60|$|That evening, as the Plumfield boys {{sat on the}} steps, as usual, in {{the mild}} September moonlight, they {{naturally}} fell <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Impossible! What is {{impossible}}? I don't know it. I {{am not a}} man <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impossible or dodge behind it. I did {{not bring}} you here." ...|$|R
6000|$|TALK. I {{like you}} wonderfully well, for your saying is full <b>of</b> <b>the</b> truth; and I will add, What thing is so pleasant, and what so profitable, as <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> things <b>of</b> God? What things so pleasant? that is, {{if a man}} hath any delight in things that are wonderful. For instance, if a man doth delight <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history or <b>the</b> mystery <b>of</b> things, or if a man doth love <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> miracles, wonders, or signs, where shall he find things written so delightful, or so sweetly penned, as in the Holy Scripture? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{not only}} the grass. I've a hundred miles <b>of</b> fencing on <b>the</b> run which is as dry as tinder, not <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station and the wool-shed." ...|$|R
60|$|Loveday {{returned}} to the mill without further delay; and shortly explaining that John was very well, and would come soon, went on <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arrival <b>of</b> Nelson's captain.|$|R
60|$|Matthew and {{his friends}} began ostentatiously <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weather and other such trifling matters, until after the guard had passed, then once more they put their heads together.|$|R
6000|$|... "That was lucky. But {{you have}} a curious temperament. When we began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accidents, you remembered the damage to Fuller's {{property}} before the risk to your life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Psha!" [...] he {{said again}} angrily. How could any one presume <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worldly station <b>of</b> his goddess? For just then Madeline Staveley to him was a goddess! ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{successive}} Liberal Democrat leadership contests, Ã–pik {{gained a}} reputation for backing campaigns that soon collapsed, leading some <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "curse <b>of</b> Lembit" [...] making his backing undesirable.|$|R
60|$|The boys {{sat down}} on <b>the</b> bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brook, and began to pick up little stones and throw them into the water. They began soon <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window again.|$|R
6000|$|... "For shame!" [...] she cried. Still she was pleased. With {{mention of}} her boy she began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> little fellow, <b>to</b> {{wonder what he}} was doing on this very Sunday morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "Brother, the Moon {{alone is}} beyond you, for she inhabits the sky while you still dwell upon the earth," [...] he {{answered}} with a frown, and then began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peace with Huaracha.|$|R
60|$|And Mr. Fyshe and the {{gigantic}} Doctor walked {{side by side}} homewards along Plutoria Avenue, beneath the elm trees. Nor had they gone any great distance before Dr. Boomer fell <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Duke.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sight," [...] I rejoined, impatiently; [...] "I want to {{know who}} the man was, how he died, and why he is not decently buried. Can you tell me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I know--have heard {{something}} about it,' said Picotee, blushing with anger. 'It was {{nothing at all}} like that. I wonder Mr. Neigh had <b>the</b> audacity ever <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matter, and <b>to</b> misrepresent it so greatly!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before {{you went}} to Berlin," [...] she said, [...] "you used not <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{psychology}} <b>of</b> love. Your methods, so far as I remember them, were a little different. Confess now--you fell in love in Berlin." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} Bickley reappeared {{and she began}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dress, saying that it showed more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neck than had been the custom among <b>the</b> women <b>of</b> her people, but was very pretty.|$|R

60|$|The {{young lady}} changed <b>the</b> {{position}} <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vases {{and went back}} to the two young men. They began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same subject. Once or twice the young lady glanced at me over her shoulder.|$|R
60|$|And so, after <b>the</b> manner <b>of</b> women neighbors, {{they began}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fall round-up, and <b>the</b> near {{approach}} <b>of</b> winter with its loneliness, and <b>the</b> children, all <b>of</b> which naturally {{led to more}} personal and interesting topics.|$|R
50|$|Whereas at <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{play there}} is a {{reluctance}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past, after each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shocking revelations the three women willingly drift off into nostalgia at the end as a means <b>of</b> coping with <b>the</b> present.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{was down}} in Jim Slagg's berth, having a chat with him about <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> {{electric}} currents--for {{he has a very}} inquiring mind,--and somehow we diverged to ghosts, and began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ghost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Eastern.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{a battle}} I ever fought before, Monsieur," [...] said Michael; [...] "nor do I ever wish to fight another; it's horrid weary work, this of {{knocking}} men's brains out, not <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chance a man runs {{of losing his}} own." ...|$|R
