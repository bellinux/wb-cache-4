5|$|Iravan is {{also known}} in Indonesia (where his name is spelled Irawan). An {{independent}} set of traditions have developed around Irawan on the main island of Java where, for example, he loses his association with the Naga. Separate Javanese traditions present a dramatic marriage of Irawan to Titisari, daughter of Krishna, and a death resulting from a case of mistaken identity. <b>These</b> <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> told {{through the medium of}} traditional Javanese theatre (Wayang), especially in shadow-puppet plays known as Wayang Kulit.|$|E
5|$|During the High Middle Ages tales {{originating}} from Brythonic traditions entered English folklore—the Arthurian myth. These {{were derived from}} Anglo-Norman, Welsh and French sources, featuring King Arthur, Camelot, Excalibur, Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table such as Lancelot. <b>These</b> <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> most centrally brought together within Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). Another early figure from British tradition, King Cole, may {{have been based on}} a real figure from Sub-Roman Britain. Many of the tales and pseudo-histories make up part of the wider Matter of Britain, a collection of shared British folklore.|$|E
5|$|Kitsune are {{commonly}} portrayed as lovers, usually in stories involving a young human male and a kitsune {{who takes the}} form of a human woman. The kitsune may be a seductress, but <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> more often romantic in nature. Typically, the young man unknowingly marries the fox, who proves a devoted wife. The man eventually discovers the fox's true nature, and the fox-wife is forced to leave him. In some cases, the husband wakes as if from a dream, filthy, disoriented, and far from home. He must then return to confront his abandoned family in shame.|$|E

5|$|Other {{scholars}} such as Hazra and Rocher {{state that}} the Puranas are not a reliable source for dating Krishna or Indian history, because the content therein about kings, various peoples, sages, and kingdoms is highly inconsistent across the manuscripts. They state that <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> probably {{based in part on}} real events, in part on hagiography, and in part embellished by expansive imagination. A high degree of inconsistency and manuscript corruption occurred particularly from the 12thcentury onwards, evidenced by cross referencing the texts; Matsya Purana, for example, stated that Kurma Purana has 18,000 verses, while Agni Purana asserts the same text has 8,000 verses, and Naradiya attests that the Kurma manuscript has 17,000 verses. The Puranic literature has gone through slow redaction and text corruption over time, as well as sudden deletion of numerous chapters and its replacement with new content to an extent that the currently circulating Puranas are completely different from those that existed before the 11thcentury, or 16thcentury. For example, a newly discovered palm-leaf manuscript in Nepal has been dated to be from 810CE, but is quite different from versions of the same Purana text that have been circulating in South Asia since the colonial era.|$|E

25|$|For Medical Tales Retold, Seluk draws comics about unusual or {{touching}} {{stories he}} gets through his email. <b>These</b> <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> about illnesses and injuries {{and can be}} sent in by doctors or patients. The concept of Medical Tales Retold came up in collaboration with Tapastic. After Seluk saw an artist illustrate personal love stories through Tapastic, {{he thought it would}} be a good idea to normalize unusual medical stories through humor.|$|E
25|$|From {{an artistic}} standpoint, <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> rather laboured productions, besides being ultra-romantic in tone; {{but it must}} be remembered that they were written mainly with an {{educational}} goal, and, moreover, they deserve high praise for their style. Herculano had greater book-learning than Scott, but lacked descriptive talent and skill in dialogue. His touch is heavy, and these novels show no dramatic power, which accounts for his failure as a playwright, but their influence was as great as their followers were many.|$|E

25|$|This {{book was}} {{followed}} by Bud Neill's Magic! again with biographical notes, and with a selection from the many pocket cartoons, showing their changing subjects and styles over the years. Further Adventures of the Wee Boy {{tells the story of}} the bronze statue in a foreword, and reprints a further five of the shilling booklets. <b>These</b> <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> patchy in style, including some where more realistically drawn characters mix with his cartoon figures, but give more examples of Neill's quirky humour and fine touch with pen and lamp-black ink.|$|E
25|$|Since these myths were {{documented}} by historians like Pausanias, who lived {{during the reign}} of Marcus Aurelius in the 160AD, it is likely that <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> more fable than fact. It was often supposed that the origins of many aspects of the Olympics date to funeral games of the Mycenean period and later. Alternatively, the games were thought to derive from some kind of vegetation magic or from initiation ceremonies. The most recent theory traces the origins of the games to large game hunting and related animal ceremonialism.|$|E
25|$|Sayre also {{discusses}} {{at length}} Franklin's struggle in pursuing science, particularly her father's concern {{about women in}} academic professions. This account had been taken to accuse Ellis Franklin of sexism against his daughter. A good deal of information explicitly claims that he strongly opposed her entering Newnham College. Franklin's Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) biography goes further by stating that he refused to pay her fees, and that an aunt stepped in for her. Her sister Jenifer Glynn explains that <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> myths, and that her parents fully supported Franklin's entire career.|$|E

25|$|For generations, {{there have}} been legends recounted by the {{inhabitants}} of the areas surrounding Mount Kanchenjunga, both in Sikkim and in Nepal, that there is a valley of immortality hidden on its slopes. <b>These</b> <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> well known to both the original inhabitants of the area, the Lepcha people, and those of the Tibetan Buddhist cultural tradition. In Tibetan, this valley is known as Beyul Demoshong. In 1962 a Tibetan Lama by the name of Tulshuk Lingpa led over 300 followers into the high snow slopes of Kanchenjunga to ‘open the way’ to Beyul Demoshong. The story of this expedition is recounted in the 2011 book A Step Away from Paradise.|$|E
25|$|The sīra {{literature}} {{includes a}} variety of heterogeneous materials, containing mainly stories of military expeditions undertaken by Muhammad and his companions. <b>These</b> <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> intended as historical accounts and used for veneration. The sīra also includes a number of written documents, such as political treaties (e.g., Treaty of Hudaybiyyah or Constitution of Medina), military enlistments, assignments of officials, letters to foreign rulers, and so forth. It also records some of the speeches and sermons made by Muhammad, like his speech at the Farewell Pilgrimage. Some of the sīra accounts include verses of poetry commemorating certain events and battles. While {{some of which are}} considered to be of a lesser quality and lacking authenticity, the most serious of those are the ones by Hassan ibn Thabit.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} for certain {{about the history of}} wayang golek, but {{scholars}} have speculated that it most likely originated in China and arrived in Java sometime in the 17th century. Some of the oldest traditions of wayang golek are from the north coast of Java in what is called the pasisir region. This is home to some of the oldest Muslim kingdoms in Java and it is likely the wayang golek grew in popularity through telling the wayang menak stories of Amir Hamza, the uncle of Muhammad. <b>These</b> <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> still widely performed in Kabumen, Tegal, and Jepara as wayang golek menak, and in Cirebon, wayang golek cepak. Legendary origins of wayang golek attribute their invention to the Muslim saint Wali Sunan Kudus, who used the medium to proselytize Muslim values.|$|E

25|$|Vance wrote many {{science fiction}} short {{stories in the}} late 1940s and through the 1950s, which were {{published}} in magazines. Of his novels written during this period, a few were science fiction, but most were mysteries. Few were published at the time, but Vance continued to write mysteries into the early 1970s. In total, he wrote 15 novels outside of science fiction and fantasy, including the extended outline, The Telephone was Ringing in the Dark, published only by the VIE (Vance Integral Edition), and three books published under the Ellery Queen pseudonym. Some of these are not mysteries, such as Bird Island, and many fit uneasily in the category. <b>These</b> <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> set in and around his native San Francisco, except for one set in Italy and another in Africa. Two begin in San Francisco but take to the sea.|$|E
25|$|Though outnumbered, Geronimo {{fought against}} both Mexican and United States troops and became {{famous for his}} daring {{exploits}} and numerous escapes from capture from 1858 to 1886. One such escape, as legend has it, {{took place in the}} Robledo Mountains of southwest New Mexico. The legend states that Geronimo and his followers entered a cave, and the U.S. soldiers waited outside the entrance for him, but he never came out. Later, it was heard that Geronimo was spotted outside, nearby. The second entrance through which he escaped has yet to be found and the cave is still called Geronimo's Cave, even though no reference to this event or this cave has been found in the historic or oral record. Moreover, there are many stories of this type with other caves referenced that state that Geronimo or other Apaches entered to escape troops, but were not seen exiting. <b>These</b> <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> in all likelihood apocryphal.|$|E
