5|$|At {{a meeting}} on 29 November, the United Nations General Assembly decided to end the British Mandate on 1August1948. Palestine would be {{partitioned}} into separate Arab and Jewish states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. <b>The</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>state</b> would have fifty-six per cent of the land {{with a population of}} 490,000Jews and 325,000Arabs, while the Arab state would have 807,000Arabs, but only 10,000Jews. The population of Jerusalem would be around 105,000Arabs to 100,000Jews.|$|E
5|$|Quwatli {{opposed the}} {{proposed}} partition of the British Mandate of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, {{arguing that the}} plan, which would allocate 56% of Palestine to <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>state,</b> violated {{the rights of the}} Palestinian Arab majority. The proposal passed the UN vote and Syria made war preparations soon afterward, including co-founding the Arab Liberation Army (ALA). Quwatli had proposed the creation of the ALA as a volunteer force to attract fighters from throughout the Arab world and {{to take the place of}} Arab regular armies. The ALA's establishment was sponsored by the Arab League following the UN partition vote and Fawzi al-Qawuqji, a Syrian commander who played leading roles in the Great Syrian Revolt and the 1936 revolt in Palestine, was appointed its commander. Quwatli did not believe the armies of Syria and the Arab world were ready to successfully confront Jewish forces and as war drew near in early 1948, he petitioned Abdel Rahman Azzam, head of the Arab League, to not enter Arab armies into Palestine. Instead, Quwatli offered to provide local Palestinian Arab fighters arms and funding. Azzam was not swayed and continued his effort of rallying Arab governments to dispatch their armies. On 15 May, after the establishment of Israel was announced, Quwatli ordered the Syrian Army to enter Palestine immediately.|$|E
25|$|The land {{allocated}} to the Arab State in the final plan included about 43% of Mandatory Palestine and consisted {{of all of the}} highlands, except for Jerusalem, plus one-third of the coastline. The highlands contain the major aquifers of Palestine, which supplied water to the coastal cities of central Palestine, including Tel Aviv. <b>The</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>State</b> was to receive 56% of Mandatory Palestine, a slightly larger area to accommodate the increasing numbers of Jews who would immigrate there. <b>The</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>State</b> included three fertile lowland plains – the Sharon on the coast, the Jezreel Valley and the upper Jordan Valley. The bulk of the proposed Jewish State's territory, however, consisted of the Negev Desert. The desert was not suitable for agriculture, nor for urban development at that time. <b>The</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>State</b> would also be given sole access to the Red Sea.|$|E

25|$|Upon the {{implementation}} of the truce, the IDF had control over nine Arab cities and towns or mixed cities and towns: New Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa, Acre, Safed, Tiberias, Baysan (Beit She'an), Samakh and Yibna (Yavne). Another city, Jenin, was not occupied but its residents fled. The combined Arab forces captured 14 Jewish settlement points, but only one of them, Mishmar HaYarden, was in the territory of <b>the</b> proposed <b>Jewish</b> <b>State</b> according to Resolution 181. Within the boundaries of <b>the</b> proposed <b>Jewish</b> <b>state,</b> there were twelve Arab villages which opposed Jewish control or were captured by the invading Arab armies, and in addition to them, the Lod Airport and pumping station near Antipatris, which were within the boundaries of <b>the</b> proposed <b>Jewish</b> <b>state,</b> were under <b>the</b> control of the Arabs. The IDF captured about 50 large Arab villages outside of the boundaries of <b>the</b> proposed <b>Jewish</b> <b>State</b> and a larger number of hamlets and Bedouin encampments. 350 square kilometers of <b>the</b> proposed <b>Jewish</b> <b>State</b> were under <b>the</b> control of the Arab forces, while 700 square kilometers of the proposed Arab State were {{under the control of the}} IDF. This figure ignors the Negev desert which wasn't under any absolute control of either side.|$|R

25|$|Spong's {{conclusion}} is that early Bible authors, after the First Jewish-Roman War, sought {{to distance themselves from}} Rome's enemies.
