[...] Although Fillmore worked to gain support among German-Americans, a major constituency, {{he was hurt}} among immigrants {{by the fact that}} New York City Whigs had supported a nativist candidate in the mayoral election earlier in 1844 Fillmore and his party were <b>tarred</b> with that <b>brush.</b> He was not friendly to immigrants, and after his defeat blamed it on [...] "foreign Catholics". Clay was beaten as well. [...] Fillmore's biographer Paul Finkelman suggested that the hostility to immigrants and weak position on slavery defeated him for governor.|$|R

In any case, he goes trading inland; and though he brings down a little gum, nobody knows exactly what he buys or sells.

Rakoff said the book is [...] "essentially about pessimism and melancholy: all the other less than pleasant to feel emotions that because they are less than pleasant to feel have been more or less stricken from the public discourse but in fact have their uses and even a certain beauty to them". Rakoff argued that it is [...] "a defence of melancholy, pessimism, anxiety {{and all of the}} emotions that have been <b>tarred</b> with the <b>brush</b> of negativity and therefore stricken from the larger cultural conversation.

40|$|Public {{places of}} war memory—whether museums, {{military}} cemeteries, preservation sites, or monuments—are complex exemplars {{of a political}} collective’s responses to violence, loss, heroism, destruction, victory, defeat, unity, disunity, and/or sacrifice. Such sites also speak in various registers about shared, communal identities, oftentimes national iden-tity and character. Public memory sites of war have fre-quently been <b>tarred</b> with the <b>brush</b> of justifying, sanitizing, or idealizing war, {{as a means of}} rendering war acceptable, if not even agreeable, and thus symbolically incentivizing (or at least not opposing) military postures toward conflict in the future. For example, Miles (1997) argues that “conventional memorials present an idealised image of war [...] . [W]ar is not bloody, death does not really hurt ” (pp. 68 - 69). Depictions of heroism are one obvious means of such idealization, bu...|$|R

5000|$|When Lord Grey {{resigned}} as Prime Minister in May 1832, this caused {{a period of}} political unrest known as the Days of May. The King asked the Duke of Wellington to form a government to replace Grey's, but {{he was reluctant to}} do so. Nevertheless, according to Fraser, [...] "There was the possibility that... Charles Manners-Sutton might prove an acceptable anodyne leader because, by the nature of his office, he was not <b>tarred</b> by the <b>brush</b> of his own anti-Reform declarations." [...] Manners-Sutton spent three hours outlining his views on the matter at [...] "exhaustive and exhausting length" [...] during a crucial meeting of the Tories at Apsley House.

500|$|Paine's Age of Reason sparked enough {{anger in}} Britain to {{initiate}} {{not only a}} series of government prosecutions but also a pamphlet war. Around 50 unfavorable replies appeared between 1795 and 1799 alone and refutations were still being published in 1812. Many of these responded specifically to Paine's attack on the Bible in Part II (when Thomas Williams was prosecuted for printing Part II, it became clear its circulation had far exceeded that of Part I). Although critics responded to Paine's analysis of the Bible, they did not usually address his specific arguments. Instead, they advocated a literal reading of the Bible, citing the Bible's long history as evidence of its authority. They also issued ad hominem attacks against Paine, describing him [...] "as an enemy of proper thought and of the morality of decent, enlightened people". Dissenters such as Joseph Priestley who had endorsed the arguments of the Rights of Man turned away from those presented in The Age of Reason. Even the liberal Analytical Review was skeptical of Paine's claims and distanced itself from the book. Paine's deism was simply too radical for these more moderate reformers and they feared being <b>tarred</b> with the <b>brush</b> of extremism.|$|R
40|$|The American Welfare state {{evolved in}} a much {{different}} manner from the welfare states of other industrial nations. The formation {{of the welfare state}} in America was not the result of the political mobilization of labor but emerged during an economic crisis in an attempt to return the country to and reaffirm the capitalist economic system. The decentralized structure of the federal government, which shares power with the states in areas like social protection, has impeded the formation of a more comprehensive system. As such, the welfare state in the U. S. is market conforming and attempts to reaffirm market values of self-sufficiency. The welfare state that was created has remained largely incomplete with the majority of worker social protections to the private sector. In response, labor unions pursued a "mixed-benefit" strategy, which largely relied on private negotiations with individual employers and sought government intervention only to augment these efforts. Those left out of private sector benefits, the poor, racial minorities, and disabled, have had to rely on the paltry means-tested programs which were originally designed to phase out. As such they have been <b>tarred</b> with the <b>brush</b> of "undeservedness" that has helped fuel public hatred of means-tested programs. Growing backlash against the failure of these programs to disappear and the perception that only undeserving people benefit has prompted the abolition of entitlement cash assistance programs and the creation of assistance programs that require employment within the private sector...|$|R
5000|$|Tresham was pricked as sheriff for Northamptonshire in 1573 and was knighted at the Queen's Royal Progress at Kenilworth in 1575. He {{frequently}} entertained {{large numbers}} of friends and acquaintances but also pursued an aggressively conservative estate policy. His recusancy, Jesuit connections and arguments for the state's lack of jurisdiction in matters of conscience made him the subject of official attention, and he was imprisoned several times and fined heavily. At a time when Queen Elizabeth was anxious about the Catholic threat posed by Spain and by her cousin Mary, Queen of Scots, Catholics were made targets for persecution by their spiritual loyalty to another temporal power (the Pope, and by extension, the Catholic King of Spain). Between 1581 and 1605, Tresham paid penalties totalling just under £8,000. (equivalent to £ in [...] ). These heavy financial demands were, in reality, overshadowed by the expense of his building projects and his insistence on making advantageous marriages for his six daughters, bringing with them sizeable dowries (£12,200). His credit was thus impaired, and the ill-advised involvement of his son, Francis, in the Earl of Essex's rebellion, cost him over £3,000. As a Catholic who had Jesuit links, and who argued for an individual's right to act according to his conscience unmolested, he was <b>tarred</b> with the <b>brush</b> of disloyalty, a mark he fiercely rejected. Ultimately, his son Lewis successfully ate through what little family money was left.|$|R
6000|$|She {{learned to}} smuggle food into his hands, {{but it was}} very little, for they had not enough at home either, with the price of living ever going up and her {{depleted}} income ever stationary. They had--her [...] "man" [...] told her--made a fuss in the papers about their being fed like turkeycocks, while the [...] "Huns" [...] were sinking the ships. Gerhardt, always a spare little man, had lost eighteen pounds. She, naturally well covered, was getting thin herself, but that she did not notice, too busy all day long, and too occupied in thinking of her [...] "man." [...] To watch him week by week, more hopeless, as the months dragged on, was an acute torture, to disguise which was torture even more acute. She had long seen that there was no bright side, but if she admitted that she knew she would go down; so she did not. And she carefully kept from Gerhardt such matters as David's overgrowing his strength, because she could not feed him properly; the completely bedridden nature of auntie; and worse than these, the growing coldness and unkindness of her neighbours. Perhaps they did not mean to be unkind, perhaps they did, for it was not in their nature to withstand the pressure of mass sentiment, the continual personal discomfort of having to stand in queues, the fear of air raids, the cumulative indignation caused by stories of atrocities true and untrue. In spite of her record of kindliness towards them she became <b>tarred</b> with the <b>brush</b> at last, for her nerves had given way once or twice, and she had said it was a shame to keep her man like that, gettin' iller and iller, who had never done a thing. Even her reasonableness--and she was very reasonable--succumbed to the strain of that weekly sight of him, till she could no longer allow for the difficulties which Mrs. Clirehugh assured her the Government had to deal with. Then one day she used the words [...] "fair play," [...] and at once it became current that she had [...] "German sympathies." [...] From that time on she was somewhat doomed. Those who had received kindnesses from her were foremost in showing her coldness, being wounded in their self-esteem. To have received little benefits, such as being nursed when they were sick, from one who had [...] "German sympathies" [...] was too much for the pride which is in every human being, however humble an inhabitant of Putney. Mrs. Gerhardt's Cockney spirit could support this for herself, but she could not bear it for her children. David came home with a black eye, and would not say why he had got it. Minnie missed her prize at school, though she had clearly won it. That was just after the last German offensive began; but Mrs. Gerhardt refused to see that this was any reason. Little Violet twice put the heart-rending question to her: [...] "Aren't I English, Mummy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{outbreak}} of the war found them {{on the point of}} going to Margate for Bank Holiday, an almost unparalleled event; so that the importance of the world catastrophe was brought home to them with a vividness which would otherwise have been absent from folks so simple, domestic, and far-removed from that atmosphere in which the egg of war is hatched. Over the origin and merits of the struggle, beyond saying to each other several times that it was a dreadful thing, Mr. and Mrs. Gerhardt held but one little conversation, lying in their iron bed with an immortal brown eiderdown patterned with red wriggles over them. They agreed that it was a cruel, wicked thing to invade [...] "that little Belgium," [...] and there left a matter which seemed to them a mysterious and insane perversion of all they had hitherto been accustomed to think of as life. Reading their papers--a daily and a weekly, in which they had as much implicit faith as a million other readers--they were soon duly horrified by the reports therein of [...] "Hun" [...] atrocities; so horrified that they would express their condemnation of the Kaiser and his militarism as freely {{as if they had been}} British subjects. It was therefore with an uneasy surprise that they began to find these papers talking of [...] "the Huns at large in our midst," [...] of [...] "spies," [...] and the national danger of [...] "nourishing such vipers." [...] They were deeply conscious of not being [...] "vipers," [...] and such sayings began to awaken in both their breasts a humble sense of injustice as it were. This was more acute in the breast of little Mrs. Gerhardt, because, of course, the shafts were directed not at her but at her husband. She knew her husband so well, knew him incapable of anything but homely, kindly busyness, and that he should be lumped into the category of [...] "Huns" [...] and [...] "spies" [...] and <b>tarred</b> with the <b>brush</b> of mass hatred amazed and stirred her indignation, or would have, if her Cockney temperament had allowed her to take it very seriously. As for Gerhardt, he became extremely silent, so that it was ever more and more difficult to tell what he was feeling. The patriotism of the newspapers took a considerable time to affect the charity of the citizens of Putney, and so long as no neighbour showed signs of thinking that little Gerhardt was a monster and a spy it was fairly easy for Mrs. Gerhardt to sleep at night, and to read her papers with the feeling that the remarks in them were not really intended for Gerhardt and herself. But she noticed that her man had given up reading them, and would push them away from his eyes if, in the tiny sitting-room with the heavily-flowered walls, they happened to rest beside him. He had perhaps a closer sense of impending Fate than she. The boy, David, went to his first work, and the girls to their school, and so things dragged on through that first long war winter and spring. Mrs. Gerhardt, in the intervals of doing everything, knitted socks for [...] "our poor cold boys in the trenches," [...] but Gerhardt no longer sought out little jobs to do in the houses of his neighbours. Mrs. Gerhardt thought that he [...] "fancied" [...] they would not like it. It was early in that spring that she took a deaf aunt to live with them, the wife of her mother's brother, no blood-relation, but the poor woman had nowhere else to go; so David was put to sleep on the horsehair sofa in the sitting-room because she [...] "couldn't refuse the poor thing." [...] And then, of an April afternoon, while she was washing the household sheets, her neighbour, Mrs. Clirehugh, a little spare woman all eyes, cheekbones, hair, and decision, came in breathless and burst out: ...|$|R
