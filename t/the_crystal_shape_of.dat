40|$|Abstract [...] Hydroxy-carboxylic acids {{inhibit the}} {{crystallization}} of ferrihydrite in the pH range 9 - 11 {{in the order}} citric> meso tartaric> L-tartaric> lactic and favor hematite formation relative to goethite in the order L-tartaric> citric> meso tartaric> lactic. <b>The</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> hematite can change from hexagonal plates to acicular {{in the presence of}} these acids. The influence of the acids on the crystallization rises with increasing concentration and with falling pH. The effectiveness in suppressing crystallization depends on whether and how strongly the acid adsorbs on ferrihydrite and how strongly it complexes with Fe z+ in solution. Inhibition of crystallization of hematite is believed to be due to the di- and tricarboxylic acid linking ferrihydrite particles in an immobile network. Goethite formation is suppressed by the acid complexing with Fe in solution and hindering nucleation; strongly adsorbing acids also adsorb on the nuclei and hinder further growth. Certain acids can induce hematite formation because they contain a group which acts as a template for nucleation of hematite...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{a careful}} scrutinization {{of a number}} of microphotographs of snow {{crystals}} taken at Syowa Station, Antarctica during the period from February 1968 to January 1969, considerable data were obtained that <b>the</b> snow <b>crystal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> scalelike side planes grow from sintered frozen cloud particles. And further, based on microphotographs various stages of growth from frozen cloud droplets to snow crystals were seen indicating that <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> radiating assemblages of dendrites and radiating assemblages of plates grow from relatively large frozen cloud droplets. In an attempt to obtain supporting evidence, laboratory experiments were conducted and the growth process of snow crystals from frozen droplets were observed using a convection type cold chamber.

40|$|Rhodochrosite {{crystals}} and {{manganese oxide}} micronodules which have formed in situ {{are found in}} abundance at depth (76. 5 to 106. 5 m) in Hole 417 A. A gradual transformation of the rhodochrosite to manganese oxide micronodules is observed in many grains throughout the interval. The transformation process initially attacks {{the edge of the}} rhodochrosite crystal and proceeds inward, first forming a pseudomorph of the crystal. Some grains exhibit varying degrees of departure from <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> a true pseudomorph, suggesting either an overgrowth of manganese oxide or late-stage destruction of the pseudomorph. No significant differences were observed in the relative per cent of minor and trace metals when comparing the pure rhodochrosite with the manganese oxide pseudomorphs. This suggests that the manganese and other trace elements were not transported into the system but were incorporated directly from the rhodochrosite as the manganese oxide formed.

These limits provide assurance that Shuttle ascent performance goals will be achieved within the vehicle flight load constraints. The SRM's will perform within these limits if overall SRM reproducibility is maintained. This report will initially describe the excellent performance reproducibility of the 24 SRMs during the first 12 flights STS- 8 through STS- 26 (Mission 51 -F) using the HPM SRM. Secondly, this report will describe the transient phenomena which interrupted the reproducibility in the first 20 sec of flight for four flights (Missions 51 -I/J and 61 -A/B).

40|$|Magnetite (Fe 304) {{crystals}} {{produced by}} two strains of cultured vibrioid magnetotactic bacteria were studied by high-resolution {{transmission electron microscopy}} (HRTEM). Both magnetotactic strains were characterized by single chains of magnetite crystals aligned along the long axes of the cells. The strains, designated as MV- 2 and MV- 4, produced crystals that differed markedly in size and morphology. Crystals present in MV- 4 cells were generally larger than those in MV- 2 cells and displayed significantly smaller aspect ratios. Crystallographic analysis of the magnetosomes of MV- 2 revealed an elongated hexagonal habit based on a prism of { 110 } faces capped by { 111 } faces. The axis of elongation was parallel to the direction. This morphology closely resembles <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> magnetosomes in a previously described vibrioid species MV-I.

30|$|Detailed {{investigation}} with SEM {{shows that}} barite occurs in {{only some of}} the pore spaces of an individual rock samples, whereas others remain almost unchanged. The growth features observed for barite imply a crystallization sequence in the experiments. In the beginning, the growth of the barite crystals is tabular (Fig.  10) with a size of approx. 15  µm in the larger pore spaces. Once a barite crystal is formed, it acts as a seed and is overgrown by further barite precipitations forming a crystal agglomerate (Fig.  11). <b>The</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> the agglomerate is mostly platy with a well-defined cleavage. Crystal agglomerates {{can be found in a}} part of the pore spaces of all sandstone samples after experiment, which were either unfilled before the experiment or partially filled with clay minerals and hematite. In the latter case, the barite overgrows the illite along the margins of the pore (Fig.  12). Quartz grains have smooth surfaces with small holes and often show dissolution edges (Fig.  18), whereas such features are absent in the feldspar. Especially in the smaller pores and cracks, subhedral baryte crystals grow together forming crystal aggregates. With increasing growth or narrowing of the pore spaces, the crystals preferentially accumulate at the bottlenecks of the pore spaces (Fig.  13). This can lead to a clogging of the whole interspaces. Finally, the pore spaces and cracks get completely filled with barite crystals (Figs.  14 and 15).|$|E

Control of these properties presents a major challenge since they influence considerably downstream processing factors. Experimental work aimed at finding ways to control <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> Lacosamide, an active pharmaceutical ingredient developed by UCB Pharma, during crystallization was carried out. It {{was found that the}} crystal lattice displayed a very strong unidirectional double hydrogen bonding, which was at the origin of the needle shape of the Lacosamide crystals. Two main strategies were followed to hinder the hydrogen bonding and compete {{with the addition of a}} Lacosamide molecule along the crystal length axis: changing the crystallization medium or weakening the hydrogen bonding. Various solvents were tested to check whether the solvent used to crystallize Lacosamide had an influence on the final crystal shape. Solvent molecules seemed to slow down the growth in the length axis by hindering the unidirectional hydrogen bonding of Lacosamide crystals, but not enough to promote the crystal growth in the width axis. Additives were also tested. Certain additives have shown to compete in a more efficient way than solvent molecules with the hydrogen bonding of Lacosamide. The additive effect has also shown to be compatible with the solvent effect. In parallel, hydrogen atoms in Lacosamide were changed into deuterium atoms in order to weaken the hydrogen bonds strength. Weakening the hydrogen bonds of Lacosamide allowed to let the crystal grow in the width axis. Deuteration was found to be combinable with solvent effect while being in competition with the additive effect. The Lacosamide molecule was eventually deemed an absolute needle by the terms of Lovette and Doherty. The results of this dissertation are aimed at contributing to this classification...|$|E
40|$|Cement-based {{materials}} are of {{importance in the}} construction of geothermal wells and high-temperature oil and gas wells. These materials fill the annulus between the well casing and the rock forming a protective layer, known as sealant, which is used primarily to secure and support the casing inside the well. In addition it prevents entry of unwanted fluids into the well and communication between formation fluids at different levels. These cement based sealants need to perform for many years at high temperatures and in severe chemical environments; conditions which can cause the material of the well-casing to degrade resulting in reduced strength and increased permeability. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop new materials which will have the potential properties (high strength and low permeability) for use as sealants in geothermal and deep, hot oil wells. In order to do this special cement slurries, based on the CaO−Al 2 O 3 −SiO 2 −H 2 O (CASH) hydroceramic system, have been synthesised over the temperature range 200 to 350 °C (i. e. the typical working temperature of these wells). The additives used in these cement slurries are silica flour and alumina. A detailed description of a suite of novel hydroceramic compositions over the temperature range 200 to 350 °C is given. X-ray diffraction has been used to determine the mineralogical composition and Rietveld refinement to quantify the known phases present at different temperatures.
