5|$|In {{the midst}} of the success of Bat Out of Hell, desperate for a follow-up, {{management}} and <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>company</b> put pressure on Steinman to stop touring in order to write a follow-up, provisionally titled Renegade Angel. In a 1981 BBC Rock Hour Special interview, Jim Steinman recalls the writing process.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} {{three weeks after}} OCD {{received}} the package. Still unable to decode its meaning, <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>company</b> receives {{a phone call from}} an unknown source, tracked to Los Angeles, New York, Australia and Saturn. The caller claims to have received the same package five years ago and that it had brought destruction and chaos upon his society, and warns that they are coming after Octagon.|$|E
5|$|During {{the tour}} an {{anonymous}} person named Publius posted {{a message on}} an internet newsgroup, inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. The veracity of the message was demonstrated when white lights {{in front of the}} stage at a performance in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court in October 1994, the word enigma was projected in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that the Publius Enigma did exist, and that it had been instigated by <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>company</b> rather than the band. As of 2014 the puzzle remains unsolved.|$|E
40|$|Purpose/Aim: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to define and analyse how Swedish <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> work with digital musical content {{distributors}}. A more narrow aim is to show how <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> and with <b>the</b> digital musical content distributors iTunes Music Store and Spotify create incentives for consumer’s to use legal digital music channels through the Internet. To further circle {{the core of the}} problem following questions have been asked: How does <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> provide iTunes Music Store and Spotify with digital content and what is done by <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> to retain control over the material? How do <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> view digital musical sales and what incentives are given to consumers to buy music digitally? Finally, What position of power do iTunes Music Store and Spotify have on the digital content arena? Material/Method: The data collected for this thesis is retrieved through personal interviews with representatives from three of <b>the</b> four major <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> Universal Music, Warner Music and EMI and their Swedish branches. Main results: The consumer’s access to digital content through iTunes Music Store and Spotify is of the utmost importance and is a prerequisite. Even if <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> choose to not demand DRM protection on their products it does not stop Apple from keeping their Fairplay protection. In this way Apple is the company controlling the files, even if <b>the</b> <b>Record</b> <b>Companies</b> have made their decision based on research, which has shown that sales go down if the music files are DRM protected. <b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> have chosen not to get involved with the sales of digital content. This results in power being shifted to E-tailers such as iTunes Music Store and Spotify. The incentives the consumers are given to buy music digitally are found in the surplus value, which is supported by iTunes Music Store and Spotify. These surplus values are such services as recommendations of music or artists. Different packaging solutions, such as subscriptions through an Internet provider, do not raise the value of the music. The value is added to the Internet provider’s products and not the music, but they do guarantee a steady income for <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>companies...</b>|$|R

5|$|The album cover, {{photographed by}} Punk magazine's Roberta Bayley, {{features}} the four members {{leaning against a}} brick wall in New York City. <b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>company</b> paid only $125 for the front photo, which has since {{become one of the}} most imitated album covers of all time. The back cover depicts an eagle belt buckle along with the album's liner notes. After its release, Ramones was promoted with two singles which failed to chart. The Ramones also began touring to help sell records; these tour dates were mostly based in the United States, though two were booked in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Starr {{released}} two albums on the Mercury label. The studio album Vertical Man {{marked the}} beginning of a nine-year partnership with Mark Hudson, who produced the album and, with his band the Roundheads, formed the core of the backing group on the recordings. In addition, many famous guests joined on various tracks, including Martin, Petty, McCartney and, in his final appearance on a Starr album, Harrison. Most of the songs were written by Starr and the band. Joe Walsh and the Roundheads joined Starr for his appearance on VH1 Storytellers, which was released as an album under the same name. During the show, he performed greatest hits and new songs and told anecdotes relating to them. Starr's final release for Mercury was the 1999 Christmas-themed I Wanna Be Santa Claus. The album was a commercial failure, although <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>company</b> chose not to issue it in Britain.|$|E

40|$|For many years, <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> fought <b>the</b> idea {{of digital}} {{distribution}} via file 2 ̆ 7 sharing 2 ̆ 7 by such companies as the 2 ̆ 7 original 2 ̆ 7 illegal Napster (not the current company) and Kaazaa, who allowed users to distribute music without any compensation to <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> or artists whose music was being distributed. During this time, Napster and its ilk filled the vacuum {{created by the}} absence of legal alternative methods for consumers to get downloads of the music they wanted. After a few attempts to digitally distribute music legally themselves, <b>the</b> major <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> finally allowed Apple Inc, and its music distribution arm, iTunes, to sell digital downloads legally on a large scale. As iTunes celebrates the sale of the 3 billionth download, a lawsuit brought by some classic rock groups questions how <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> are paying artists for digital sales...|$|R

25|$|However, {{the book}} The Greatest Music Never Sold by Dan Leroy states that within one month from the album's initial {{delivery}} to A, the entire project was suddenly and unilaterally rejected.

25|$|A {{series of}} {{headlining}} tours around the UK and a sold out tour in Europe with support act Ozzy Osbourne, resulted in The Eagle Has Landed (1982 UK no 5).

25|$|The Islands {{have their}} own {{orchestra}} (the classical ensemble Aldubáran) and many different choirs; the best-known of these is Havnarkórið. The best-known local Faroese composers are Sunleif Rasmussen and Kristian Blak, who is also head of <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>company</b> Tutl. The first Faroese opera was by Sunleif Rasmussen. It is entitled Í Óðamansgarði (The Madman's Garden) and was premiered on 12 October 2006 at the Nordic House. The opera {{is based on a}} short story by the writer William Heinesen.|$|E
25|$|Things were {{contentious}} in {{the studio}} as well. She was paired with veteran producer Mick Glossop, whom she later publicly derided. They had differing visions regarding her debut album and four months'-worth of recordings were scrapped. During this time she became pregnant by her session drummer John Reynolds (who went on to drum with the band Transvision Vamp). Due largely to O'Ceallaigh's efforts of persuasion, <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>company</b> allowed O'Connor, 20 years old and by then seven months pregnant, to produce her own album.|$|E
25|$|The Church {{promoted}} Starfish with a nine-month tour {{before they}} returned to the studio for a follow-up.

In an attempt to duplicate the success of Starfish, The Church returned to Los Angeles with Waddy Wachtel producing.|$|E
