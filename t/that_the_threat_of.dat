In an op-ed, Paul disputed the Obama administration's claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> military force caused Syria's government to consider turning over its chemical weapons, instead arguing that the opposition to military action in Syria, and the delay that it caused, led to diplomatic progress.|$|E
5|$|Estimates {{show that}} up to 500,000people living in the Combeima, Chinchina, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are at risk, with 100,000 {{individuals}} being considered to be at high risk. Lahars {{pose a threat to}} the nearby towns of Honda, Mariquita, Ambalema, Chinchina, Herveo, Villa Hermosa, Salgar and La Dorada. Although small eruptions are more likely, the two-million-year eruptive history of the Ruiz–Tolima massif includes numerous large eruptions, indicating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> a large eruption cannot be ignored. A large eruption would have more widespread effects, including the potential closure of Bogotá's airport due to ashfall.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June, Germany {{launched}} a massive attack upon the Soviet Union; this attack all but removed {{the threat of}} a German invasion of the United Kingdom. However, the British still had to consider {{the threat of a}} German invasion due the possibility that the Soviet Union could collapse under the German onslaught and the ease in which Germany could transfer troops back to the west. In late 1941, the arrival of autumn and winter weather meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> invasion subsided. This, coupled with the production of new equipment for the British army, allowed the War Office to begin steps to better balance the army due to the large number of infantry units formed during the preceding year and a half. As part of this reform, the County Divisions were disbanded.|$|E

5|$|The European {{powers were}} locked in {{internal}} conflicts: e.g. the war in Lombardy. Skanderbeg believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> Mehmed launching his withheld European campaigns was at its highest. He sent urgent requests to Venice {{to prepare for a}} new Ottoman offensive, thus attempting to develop an Albanian-Venetian alliance. While recognizing the threat and Skanderbeg's sovereignty over Albania, Venice withheld an establishment of an alliance. Alfonso promised to send men and an annual pension of 1500 ducats to Skanderbeg, whereas Pope Nicholas V sent 5,000 florins. Albania, Ragusa, Serbia, and Hungary then made a loose anti-Ottoman coalition to halt any future Turkish expansions.|$|E
5|$|On 17 February 1979, China retaliated against Vietnam's {{invasion}} of Kampuchea by attacking along the Sino-Vietnam border, and within ten days {{had reached the}} provincial capitals. Fighting bogged down due to the maze of tunnels the Chinese encountered; nevertheless, the Chinese army captured Cao Bằng on 2 March and Lạng Sơn on 4 March, reportedly advancing towards Hanoi at a high speed, though not on good terms with its supply lines. However, the following day, China {{announced that it would}} not move deeper into Vietnam, apparently after meeting fierce and unexpectedly harsh resistance by well trained and equipped Vietnamese forces, supplied with American technology left behind from the Vietnam War. Confident <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> invasion had been a success, the Chinese subsequently withdrew their forces. Although China failed to decisively win the 27-day conflict, the diversion of troops from Kampuchea facilitated a strong resurgence in Khmer Rouge insurgent operations, making it unavoidable for the young PRK regime in Kampuchea to implement conscription, and requiring Vietnam to station a large portion of its army along the Sino-Vietnamese border.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasingly}} unpopular war in Korea dragged on, and the Truman {{administration was}} beset {{with a series}} of corruption scandals. He eventually decided not to run for re-election. Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic candidate in the 1952 presidential election, attempted to distance himself from the President as much as possible. The election was won by the Republican candidate, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose administration ramped up the pressure on the Chinese in Korea with conventional bombing and renewed threats of using nuclear weapons. Coupled with a more favorable international political climate {{in the wake of the}} death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, this led the Chinese and North Koreans to agree to terms. The belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> nuclear weapons played an important part in the outcome would lead to their threatened use against China on a number of occasions during the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|As Tirpitz {{was still}} {{considered}} {{a major threat}} to Allied shipping, the British military sought to damage or destroy the battleship before she could re-enter service. Another midget submarine attack was considered impractical due to improvements to Kaafjord's defences, and the commander of the RAF's Bomber Command refused to attempt heavy bomber raids against the battleship as he believed that such operations were unlikely to be successful and would result in heavy casualties. As a result, the Home Fleet's aircraft carriers were considered the best means of attacking Kaafjord, and the Admiralty directed the fleet to begin planning such a raid in late 1943. Following several months of preparations the Home Fleet's first attack on Kaafjord, which was designated Operation Tungsten, was conducted on 3 April 1944 and involved five aircraft carriers. The two strike forces of 20 Fairey Barracuda dive bombers escorted by 40 fighters were not detected during their flights to Kaafjord, and the battleship was hit by 15 bombs. Tirpitzs crew suffered heavy casualties, but the ship was not badly damaged. Nevertheless, the damage inflicted on Tirpitzs superstructure, armament and engines was sufficient to put her out of service for several months while repairs were completed. The commander of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine, Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, placed a priority on returning the battleship to service so that she could continue to tie down Allied naval resources. He and other senior German officers recognised at this time <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> further air attacks meant that Tirpitz could no longer operate against Allied convoys.|$|E

5000|$|British admiral John [...] "Jackie" [...] Fisher, {{who would}} later become the First Sea Lord in 1904, was {{especially}} impressed by the ideas of Jeune École and felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> fast raiders and swarms of torpedo boats made the traditional battleship too unwieldy.

50|$|Fearful {{of a major}} {{uncontrolled}} {{release of}} water (and sediment), officials quickly drew down {{the level of the}} reservoir, stranding the ice pack before it could cause any more damage.

25|$|In 19th-century {{discussions of}} labor relations, it was {{normally}} assumed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> starvation forced those without property {{to work for}} wages.

25|$|Differences in {{property}} {{rights have been}} cited as a possible cause of the Great Divergence.

However, others counter that many European merchants were de facto expropriated through defaults on government debt, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> expropriation by Asian states was not much greater than in Europe, except in Japan.|$|E

25|$|Concerns {{over the}} {{prospect}} of an attack soon dissipated.

Similarly, this game also provides insights into how variables like exit payoff, cost of voicing and value of loyalty change state's behavior as to whether or not to predate.|$|E

25|$|To combat {{organized}} crime, notably Mafia branches {{including the}} Cosa Nostra in Sicilia and the 'Ndrangheta in Calabria, the Fascist government gave special powers in 1925 to Cesare Mori, the prefect of Palermo. These powers {{gave him the}} ability to prosecute the Mafia, forcing many Mafiosi to flee abroad (many to the United States) or risk being jailed. However, Mori was fired {{when he began to}} investigate Mafia links within the Fascist regime and was removed from his position in 1929, when the Fascist regime declared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> the Mafia had been eliminated. Mori's actions weakened the Mafia, but did not destroy them. From 1929 to 1943, the Fascist regime completely abandoned its previously aggressive measures against the Mafia and the Mafiosi were left relatively undisturbed.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{researchers}} {{have suggested that}} men and women have innate mechanisms that contribute to why they become sexually jealous, especially for certain types of infidelity. It has been hypothesized that heterosexual men have developed an innate psychological mechanism that responds to the threat of sexual infidelity more than emotional infidelity, and vice versa for heterosexual women. This is because it is thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> cuckoldry is more detrimental to the male, who could potentially invest in offspring that is another male's, and for females, emotional infidelity would be more worrisome because they could lose the parental investment in their offspring for another woman's offspring, therefore affecting their chances of survival. However the evidence for this gender difference is debatable, as new findings are suggesting that more and more men and women today would find emotional infidelity psychologically worse (Harris, 2002).|$|E
25|$|Franz argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> {{expulsion}} {{for expressing}} {{disagreement with the}} Watch Tower Society's teachings is designed to create a sterile atmosphere in which the organization's teachings and policies can circulate without the risk of confronting serious questioning or adverse evidence. The result, according to Holden, is that individuals may {{spend most of their}} lives suppressing doubts for fear of losing their relationships with friends and relatives. Penton describes the system of judicial committees and the threat of expulsion as the ultimate control mechanism among the Witnesses; Holden claims that shunning not only rids the community of defilement, but deters others from dissident behavior. Sociologist Ronald Lawson has also noted that the group allows little room for independence of thought, and no toleration of doctrinal diversity. He said those who deviate from official teachings are readily expelled and shunned.|$|E
