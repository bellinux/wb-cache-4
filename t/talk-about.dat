50|$|Djedefhor {{enters the}} palace and goes {{immediately}} to his father, king Khufu. The prince says: “May thy majesty live, be blessed and being prosperous! I have brought Dedi to you!” Khufu replies: “Go {{and bring him}} to me!” Then Khufu {{takes place in the}} royal audience-hall. The Pharaoh receives Dedi with the words: “What is it, Dedi, this denying to have seen you ever before?” Dedi answers: “Oh sovereign, my lord! Only the one who is summoned is one who will come. I was summoned, and now see, oh sovereign, my lord, I have come.” The pharaoh continues: “Is it true, this <b>talk-about</b> that you could mend a severed head?” Dedi says: “Yes, oh sovereign, my lord. May you live, be blessed and prosperous. I know how to do that.” Khufu replies: “May a prisoner, who is jailed, be brought to me, so that his execution may be enforced.”. Dedi refuses with the words: “Not to make a human suffer, oh sovereign, my lord! May you live, be blessed and prosperous. You see, it was never allowed {{to do something like that}} on the noble flock.” Dedi chooses three animals instead - first a goose. He decapitates the goose and places her head at the eastern side of the audience hall, the body at the western side. Then Dedi utters a secret spell and the head of the goose stands up, starting to waddle. Then the body of the goose stands up and waddles, too. Both body-parts move into equal directions, then melt together. The resurrected goose now leaves the hall cackling. The same performance is done with an undefined water bird and a bull. Both animals are brought successfully back to life, too. Now the king says: “It is said that you know the number of Iput inside the wenet-sanctuary of Thoth. Now?” Dedi replies: “May you be praised, oh sovereign, my lord! I don't know their number. But I know where they can be found.” Khufu asks: “Where is it?” Dedi answers: “There is a box of scrolls, made of flint, which is stored in a room called ‘archive’ at Heliopolis.” The king orders: “Take that box!” Dedi replies: “May your highness be prosperous and blessed, I'm not the one who can bring it to you.” Khufu asks: “Who may be the one who could bring it to me?” Dedi answers: “The eldest of the three children in the womb of Rededjet, he will bring it to you.” The king says: “I really wish all these things you say. Who is it, this Rededjet?” Dedi replies: “It's the wife of a wab-priest of the god Ra, lord of Sachebu. The god has adumbrated, that the eldest of the three shall worship as a high priest of Heliopolis over the whole realm.” The king's mood becomes grim after this. Dedi asks: “What is that heart of thine, oh sovereign, my lord, becoming so sad! Is it because of the children I have adumbrated? First your son, then his son and then one of them.” Khufu replies: “When will this Rededjet give birth?” Dedi says: “It will happen during the first month of the peret-season, on the fifteenth day.″ Khufu becomes indignant: “But it's when the canal-of-two-Mugilidae is cut off!? I would even work with my very own hands to enter them! And then I will visit that temple of Ra, lord of Sachebu.” And Dedi says: “Then I will make the waters at the fordable spots of the canal-of-two-Mugilidae become four cubits in height for you.” Khufu stands up and orders: “Have Dedi assigned to a place within the palace of my son Djedefhor where he shall live from now on. His daily gainings be 1000 loaves of bread, 100 jars of beer, one neat and 100 bundles of field garlic.” And all things are done as ordered.|$|E
40|$|Dear Scott— A playwright’s {{more or less}} unrequited {{correspondence}} with the Minister/s for Immigration & Border Protection I’d signed petitions and marched on demonstrations. With friends and colleagues {{there was a lot}} of <b>talk—about</b> mean spirits and narrow minds, about dirty political tricks to win votes. But it wasn’t enough. For all the anger I felt about Australia’s treatment of asylum-seekers, what had I, Noëlle Janaczewska, actually done? My outrage was aired in cafés and across dinner tables with people who shared it, and there it stayed. Because whenever I thought about the cruel and punitive way this country deals with refugees I felt hopeless—or helpless—or both. The issue seemed too big. The people who could change things had no heart to do so. But it wasn’t enough to sigh and splutter at each successive policy announcement. I needed to translate my anger into something tangible, challenge those responsible for sending asylum-seekers to offshore gulags. Words would be my weapon of choice. Christmas Day 2013. I wrote a letter to Scott Morrison, then Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. A paper, snail-mail missive, not an email likely to get ‘lost’ in his department’s spam filter. And every Wednesday for the next 6 months, I wrote to the Minister. This is our correspondence...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to explore the discursive and social {{functions}} of talk engaged in by language learners about language in natural settings, to raise awareness of the benefits of such practice, and to discuss some of its pedagogical implications. Authentic interactions between study-abroad students and native speakers of German that deal overtly with aspects of language are analyzed. These conversational events are labeled “Talk-about-Language” and are distinguished from focus-on-form (Long, 1991) because they do not relate directly to the acquisition of particular forms, and because they do not occur in the classroom, but rather in naturalistic settings in Germany. The research questions for the analysis are (1) how do L 2 learners engage in Talk-about-Language?, (2) what conversational or discursive functions does Talk-about-Language serve?, and (3) how is <b>Talk-about</b> Language to be understood as social practice? Employing some of the tools of conversation and discourse analysis, several conversational excerpts are analyzed in order to categorize Talk-about-Language events into a taxonomy and explore Talk-about-Language as a component of L 2 learners’ socialization as legitimate peripheral participants in the L 2 culture (Lave & Wenger, 1991). Implications for issues of language program articulation, curriculum design, and classroom practice are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Biogenetics dominates {{contemporary}} discussions—scientific, media, and {{in everyday}} <b>talk—about</b> {{the origins of}} diseases, ethnicities, tribes, and nations. This dissertation sheds light on the dynamics—of affect, history, memory, and bureaucracies—that shape and animate biogenetic explanations. The dissertation builds on fine-grained fieldwork at genomic databases, genealogical registries, family history societies, and medical clinics in Quebec to illuminate the conceptions of family, heredity, and human difference—often intertwined—that are defining analytic boundaries and the acceptance and use of evidence within medical genetics. The dissertation focuses on the multiple trajectories of a particular form of medical genetic evidence, the Catholic Church vital record. The Catholic Church mandated personal data record-taking during the Counter Reformation and, as a result, historically Catholic European countries and their numerous African, Asian, and American colonies {{have some of the}} most comprehensive catalogues of historic birth and marriage information in the world. Geneticists and medical researchers in Quebec use these records to infer long durée family genealogies and then deduce the origins of “French diseases. ” The dissertation investigates the clinical, experimental, and historiographic rationales that sustain their genealogical conclusions and etiological explanations, as well as the rationales sustaining explanations of those who oppose them. The dissertation unearths the exigencies—from colonial French Church writing strictures to laboratory infrastructures—of how medical workers, genealogists, and people beyond the purview of health, medicine, and genealogy delineate families, risk, and race. In looking at how written cultures, colonial histories, family practices, and feelings about the past {{play a role in the}} production of genetic knowledge, the dissertation broadens the scope of traditional scholarly investigations of race and medicine. Many of these investigations, working within a Foucauldian rubric, have focused narrowly on constraints placed on consciousness by domineering state and social power structures. In contrast, this dissertation illustrates how diverse investments in ancestors and pragmatic choices about evidence also shape the styles of reasoning about family, heredity, and human groups that animate biogenetic worlds...|$|E
