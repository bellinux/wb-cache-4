40|$|Abstract Background Quality {{measures}} {{should be}} subjected to a <b>testing</b> <b>protocol</b> before being used in practice using key attributes such as acceptability, feasibility and reliability, as well as identifying issues derived from actual implementation and unintended consequences. We describe the methodologies and results of an indicator <b>testing</b> <b>protocol</b> (ITP) using data from proposed quality indicators for the United Kingdom Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF). Methods The indicator <b>testing</b> <b>protocol</b> involved a multi-step and methodological process: 1) The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method, to test clarity and necessity, 2) data extraction from patients' medical records, to test technical feasibility and reliability, 3) diaries, to test workload, 4) cost-effectiveness modelling, and 5) semi-structured interviews, to test acceptability, implementation issues and unintended consequences. Testing was conducted {{in a sample of}} representative family practices in England. These methods were combined into an overall recommendation for each tested indicator. Results Using an indicator <b>testing</b> <b>protocol</b> as part of piloting was seen as a valuable way of testing potential indicators in 'real world' settings. Pilot 1 (October 2009 -March 2010) involved thirteen indicators across six clinical domains and twelve indicators passed the indicator <b>testing</b> <b>protocol.</b> However, the indicator <b>testing</b> <b>protocol</b> identified a number of implementation issues and unintended consequences that can be rectified or removed prior to national roll out. A palliative care indicator is used as an exemplar of the value of piloting using a multiple attribute indicator <b>testing</b> <b>protocol</b> - while technically feasible and reliable, it was unacceptable to practice staff and raised concerns about potentially causing actual patient harm. Conclusions This indicator <b>testing</b> <b>protocol</b> is one example of a protocol that may be useful in assessing potential quality indicators when adapted to specific country health care settings and may be of use to policy-makers and researchers worldwide to test the likely effect of implementing indicators prior to roll out. It builds on and codifies existing literature and other <b>testing</b> <b>protocols</b> to create a field testing methodology {{that can be used to}} produce country specific quality indicators for pay-for-performance or quality improvement schemes. </p...|$|R

This paper {{presents}} an efficient {{construction of a}} private disjointness <b>testing</b> <b>protocol</b> that is secure against malicious provers and honest-but-curious (semi-honest) verifiers, {{without the use of}} random oracles. In a completely semi-honest setting, this construction implements a private intersection cardinality protocol. We formally define both private intersection cardinality and private disjointness <b>testing</b> <b>protocols.</b> The HW construction will be proven secure under the subgroup decision and subgroup computation assumptions. A major advantage of HW {{is that it does not}} require bilinear groups, random oracles, or non-interactive zero knowledge proofs. Applications of private intersection cardinality and disjointness <b>testing</b> <b>protocols</b> include privacy-preserving data mining and anonymous login systems...|$|R

The <b>testing</b> <b>protocols</b> address longitudinal, lateral, and stability-oriented traffic scenarios. The longitudinal scenarios include a pedestrian crossing the road in front of the vehicle, or the situation where a driver approaches a stationary queue of cars. Involuntarily lane departures and cars in the blind spot during a lane change are situations covered by the lateral scenarios. Exiting a highway, avoiding an obstacle, and braking on a partially ice-covered road surface are examples of traffic scenarios related to stability...|$|R
