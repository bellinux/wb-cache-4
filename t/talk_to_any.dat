500|$|In February 2016 Tinkov {{said that}} {{although}} he was [...] "happy to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> buyer", he expected that the most likely outcome for the team would be its disbanding {{at the end of}} the year. However in July 2016 he said that he was planning to return to the sport after [...] "a few seasons off", once Chris Froome retires from competition, with the aim of winning the Tour de France.|$|E
500|$|ElBaradei {{called on}} the army to intervene. He also said Mubarak {{should be given a}} [...] "safe exit" [...] for Friday's [...] "Departure Day." [...] and that [...] "Today's {{violence}} is again an indication of a criminal regime that has lost any common sense. When the regime tries to counter a peaceful demonstration by using thugs... there are few words that do justice to this villainy and I think it can only hasten that regime's departure." [...] A coalition of opposition parties agreed to hold talks with the newly formed government. However, ElBaradei and the Muslim Brotherhood stressed they would not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> government representative, including Vice President Omar Suleiman, until Mubarak's resignation.|$|E
500|$|Leading {{up to the}} 1986 elections, it {{was unclear}} whether Mathias would seek a fourth term. His support of President Reagan was lukewarm, which had further {{isolated}} him ideologically from his Republican colleagues. One delegate at the Maryland state party convention had even called Mathias [...] "liberal swine" [...] for his record. Additionally, his frequent difficulties in securing a committee chairmanship along with his low attendance rate were raising questions regarding his ability. However, Mathias was showing signs of seeking re-election in 1985, and dismissed any claims of ineffectiveness. Mathias claimed [...] "within a matter of minutes, I can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> member of the Cabinet; and I could go see them within 24 hours.... It was no accident that the Chesapeake Bay was mentioned in the President's State of the Union address. That took a lot of hard work".|$|E

2500|$|That season, Derby {{failed to}} retain their title, {{finishing}} 7th, but reached the semi-finals of the European Cup in April 1973, when they were knocked out by Juventus 3–1 on aggregate. After the game, Clough emerged from the dressing room and told the expectant Italian reporters [...] "No cheating bastards do I talk to. I will not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> cheating bastards" [...] and then questioned the Italian nation's courage in the Second World War. It was these sorts of frequent, outspoken comments – particularly against football's establishment, such as the FA and club directors, and figures in the game such as Sir Matt Busby, Alan Hardaker, Alf Ramsey, Don Revie and Len Shipman, along with players such as Billy Bremner, Norman Hunter and Peter Lorimer – combined with Clough's increased media profile, that eventually led to his falling out with the Rams' chairman, Sam Longson, and the Derby County board of directors.|$|E

6000|$|... "If George <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> bootmaker or any hatter {{the things}} that are put down here, it is not support he will want; it is {{carrying}} to the hospital that he will need." ...|$|R
6000|$|To {{which my}} aunt would reply, [...] "I hate <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> one who agrees with me. It's {{like taking a}} walk to see one's own looking-glass. I'd rather <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{somebody}} who didn't, {{even if he were}} a fool," [...] which for her was gracious.|$|R
60|$|She rushed {{from the}} room, with cheeks burning like fire. Come what might, she never could <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> living soul again about that awful episode.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{such matters}} {{you should never}} <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> one, Mr. Finn. If you cannot fight your own battle, no one can fight it for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hetty closed one hand. [...] "I'm {{going to}} be angry in a minute. That's {{not the way to}} <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> one who's feeling--what I am just now." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Allie," [...] he said, [...] "you don't {{have to keep}} {{cooped up}} in there unless I tell you. But don't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> one--and don't go that way." ...|$|E
6000|$|ANTHONY. Mallard was a candlestick, paraded as such. Think awhile. Recollect {{last season}} and the talk then. Mallard or no Mallard, did Gaddy ever <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> other woman? ...|$|E
6000|$|Kelley {{was quick}} to take {{advantage}} of sunset emotion. [...] "Tell her we will be here before sunrise. Warn her not to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> one." [...] And to all this Eugene gave ready assent.|$|E

60|$|Every {{night in}} the dark he went to Mary's home and sat {{with her on the}} porch. He never went inside. For all he knew, his visits were unknown to her neighbors. Still, it did not matter to him if they found out. To her he could talk as he had never <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> one. She liberated all his thought and fancy. He filled her mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are exaggerating trifles," [...] {{she said}} coldly. [...] "I have felt nervous and {{depressed}} all day, and I {{did not care}} to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> one. I have not avoided you more than anybody else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, ye're {{an honest}} rebel--rebel, yes, rebel. Hark ye, hark. Say nothing of this <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> one. And hark again. So {{long as you}} remain here at Kew, I shall see that you are safe--safe." ...|$|E

5000|$|Two {{days after}} his resignation, Doherty {{conducted}} an interview with Jay Bilas for ESPN. In the interview, Doherty stated his resignation was mishandled. Doherty claimed Baddour and his assistants failed <b>to</b> attend <b>any</b> of Doherty's practices and <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> of Doherty's assistant coaches. A spokesperson for UNC-Chapel Hill, {{speaking on behalf of}} Baddour, denied the claims. [...] Jawad Williams defended Doherty after his resignation; he believed any collegiate basketball coach would have anger issues.|$|R
2500|$|Arkansas Governor Charles Hillman Brough {{appointed}} a Committee of Seven to investigate. The group {{was composed of}} prominent local white businessmen.

6000|$|... 'Yes,' {{said the}} coachman, 'she's a curious woman seemingly. She'll <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> poor body she meets. You see {{she had been}} out for a morning walk {{instead of going to}} bed, and that is some queer mortal or other she has picked up with on her way.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Kendricks, old fellow," [...] he said, [...] "I don't {{want to be}} rude, but I am not in {{the humor}} to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> one.

6000|$|... "A great comfort;--only I wish it {{had been}} sooner. I could have <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> you about things which I never did <b>talk</b> of <b>to</b> <b>any</b> one. I wonder why I {{should have been a}} duke, and another man a servant." ...|$|R

60|$|Stephen {{reached the}} brow of the hill, and felt {{inclined}} to renounce his idea. His mood {{was such that}} <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> person <b>to</b> whom he could not unburden himself would be wearisome. However, before he could put any inclination into effect, the young man saw from amid the trees a bright light shining, the rays from which radiated like needles through the sad plumy foliage of the yews. Its direction was from {{the centre of the}} churchyard.|$|R
