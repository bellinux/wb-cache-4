5|$|In 1973, {{the naval}} museum curator Robert F. Sumrall (following Kerr) {{suggested}} a {{mechanism by which}} dazzle camouflage may have sown the kind of confusion that Wilkinson had intended for it. Coincidence rangefinders used for naval artillery had an optical mechanism, operated by a human to compute the range. The operator adjusted the mechanism until the two half-images of the target lined up in a complete picture. Dazzle, Sumrall argued, was intended to make <b>that</b> <b>hard,</b> as clashing patterns looked abnormal even when the two halves were aligned, something that became more important when submarine periscopes included such rangefinders. Patterns sometimes also included a false bow wave to {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate the ship's speed.|$|E
5|$|Writer Ed Burns, {{who worked}} as a public school teacher after {{retiring}} from the Baltimore police force shortly before going to work with Simon, has called education the theme of the fourth season. Rather than focusing solely on the school system, the fourth season looks at schools as a porous part of the community that are affected by problems outside of their boundaries. Burns states that education comes from many sources other than schools and that children can be educated by other means, including contact with the drug dealers they work for. Burns and Simon see the theme as an opportunity to explore how individuals end up like the show's criminal characters, and to dramatize the notion <b>that</b> <b>hard</b> work is not always justly rewarded.|$|E

25|$|In {{its early}} years rock-cracking, hard labour and solitary {{confinement}} were the notable features of life at the prison. It was seen <b>that</b> <b>hard</b> worked prisoners would not wish {{to return to the}} prison, with solitary confinement giving them time to reflect on past misdeeds. From inception prisoners main task was the breaking of one cubic yard of rock per day. Until the middle of the 20th century the prisons department's philosophy remained punitive with much reliance on obedience to rules and regulations.|$|E
25|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century many of the merchants would sell silk, jade and consult feng shui to open shops that favour better spiritual arrangements.

And due to the commercial success of merchants, boatmen, carters and fishermen there, Hong Kong overtook China's most populous port in Canton.

25|$|In Ex parte Wilson (1885) and United States v.

In Ex parte Bain (1887) and Parkinson v. United States (1887), the Court held that an authorized sentence of one year in the penitentiary was sufficiently infamous.|$|E
25|$|Many Jews from {{diaspora}} {{made their}} way into Judea to join Bar Kokhba's forces {{from the beginning of the}} rebellion, with traditional assumption <b>that</b> <b>hard</b> tests were imposed on recruits due to inflated number of volunteers to fight the Romans.

According to Jewish sources some 400,000 men were at the disposal of Bar Kokhba at the peak of the rebellion, though historians tend to more conservative numbers of 200,000.|$|E

25|$|Recognition {{that the}} {{tendency}} to believe <b>that</b> <b>hard</b> work and persistence often results in attainment of life and academic goals has influenced formal educational and counseling efforts with students of various ages and in various settings since the 1970s research about achievement. Counseling aimed toward encouraging individuals to design ambitious goals and work toward them, with recognition that there are external factors that may impact, often results in the incorporation of a more positive achievement style by students and employees, whatever the setting, to include higher education, workplace, or justice programming.|$|E

25|$|When the ice melted, {{the upper}} Great Lakes emptied into the Niagara River, which {{followed}} the rearranged topography across the Niagara Escarpment. In time, the river cut a gorge through the north-facing cliff, or cuesta. Because {{of the interactions}} of three major rock formations, the rocky bed did not erode evenly. The top rock formation was composed of erosion-resistant limestone and Lockport dolostone. <b>That</b> <b>hard</b> layer of stone eroded more slowly than the underlying materials. The aerial photo on the right clearly shows the hard caprock, the Lockport Formation (Middle Silurian), which underlies the rapids above the falls, and approximately the upper third of the high gorge wall.|$|E

On February 16, 2013, Nathan Abshire, one of the defendants in Hard Drive Productions, Inc. v. Does 1–1,495, filed a new lawsuit (MND 13-cv-00380) against Hard Drive Productions. Abshire alleged that after the disclosing of the Does' identities in September 2012, Hard Drive Productions, Inc. began harassing Nathan over the phone and continued to propose various unacceptable settlement proposals. The complaint primarily requested that the court issue an order declaring that Abshire not be liable for copyright infringement, <b>that</b> <b>Hard</b> Drive Productions's purported copyright on its work was unenforceable or invalid. It also requested that Abshire be awarded costs, disbursements, and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees.|$|E

The insurance effect is the same; it's just that the supply of insured currency is restricted and controlled by government. See capital control.|$|E
25|$|Jacob ben Asher {{thought that}} washing the mouth was not {{sufficient}} to remove all residue of cheese, and suggested that eating some additional solid food is required to clean the mouth. Hard and aged cheese has long been rabbinically considered to need extra precaution, {{on the basis that}} it might have a much stronger and longer lasting taste; the risk of it leaving a fattier residue has more recently been raised as a concern. According to these rabbinic opinions, the same precautions (including a pause of up to six hours) apply to eating hard cheese before meat as apply to eating meat in a meal when the meat is eaten first. Judah ben Simeon, a 17th-century doctor in Frankfurt, argued <b>that</b> <b>hard</b> cheese is not problematic if melted.
