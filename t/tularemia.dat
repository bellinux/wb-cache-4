5|$|Advances in {{bacteriology}} in the 20th century increased {{the sophistication of}} possible bio-agents in war. Biological sabotage—in the form of anthrax and glanders—was undertaken {{on behalf of the}} Imperial German government during World War I, with indifferent results. In World War II, Britain weaponised <b>tularemia,</b> anthrax, brucellosis, and botulism toxins, but never used them.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, <b>tularemia,</b> bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch <b>tularemia</b> from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Among large North American carnivores, {{the coyote}} {{probably}} carries {{the largest number}} of diseases and parasites, likely due to its wide range and varied diet. Viral diseases known to infect coyotes include rabies, canine distemper, infectious canine hepatitis, four strains of equine encephalitis, and oral papillomatosis. By the late 1970s, serious rabies outbreaks in coyotes had ceased to be a problem for over 60 years, though sporadic cases every 1–5 years did occur. Distemper causes the deaths of many pups in the wild, though some specimens can survive infection. <b>Tularemia,</b> a bacterial disease, infects coyotes through their rodent and lagomorph prey, and can be deadly for pups.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes are {{the most}} {{important}} rabies vector in Europe. In London, arthritis is not uncommon in foxes, being particularly frequent in the spine. Foxes may be infected with leptospirosis and <b>tularemia,</b> though they are not overly susceptible to the latter. They may also fall ill from listeriosis and spirochetosis, as well as acting as vectors in spreading erysipelas, brucellosis and tick-born encephalitis. A mysterious fatal disease near Lake Sartlan in the Novosibirsk Oblast was noted among local red foxes, but the cause was undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of encephalomyelitis, which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes. Individual cases of foxes infected with Yersinia pestis are known.|$|E
5|$|Ticks are {{implicated in}} the {{transmission}} {{of a number of}} infections caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses and protozoa. Sometimes the tick harbours more than one type of pathogen, making diagnosis of the infection more difficult. Species of the bacterium Rickettsia are responsible for typhus, rickettsialpox, Boutonneuse fever, African tick bite fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Flinders Island spotted fever and Queensland tick typhus (Australian tick typhus). Other tick-borne diseases include Lyme disease and Q fever, Colorado tick fever, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, <b>tularemia,</b> tick-borne relapsing fever, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, Bourbon virus and tick-borne meningoencephalitis, as well as bovine anaplasmosis and probably the Heartland virus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tularemia,</b> a {{bacterial}} disease caused by Francisella tularensis, is variously transmitted, including by biting flies. Culex and Culiseta are vectors of <b>tularemia,</b> {{as well as}} arbovirus infections such as West Nile virus.|$|E
25|$|In Britain, the 1950s saw the weaponization of plague, brucellosis, <b>tularemia</b> {{and later}} equine {{encephalomyelitis}} and vaccinia viruses, but the programme was unilaterally cancelled in 1956. The United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories weaponized anthrax, <b>tularemia,</b> brucellosis, Q-fever and others.|$|E
25|$|Human {{diseases}} {{transmitted by}} microtine rodents include cystic hydatid disease, <b>tularemia,</b> bubonic plague, babesiosis, giardiasis and the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi.|$|E
25|$|Tuberculosis {{has been}} {{recorded}} in stoats inhabiting the former Soviet Union and New Zealand. They are largely resistant to <b>tularemia,</b> but are reputed to suffer from canine distemper in captivity. Symptoms of mange have also been recorded.|$|E
25|$|Plague fleas, {{infected}} {{clothing and}} infected supplies encased in bombs were dropped on various targets. The resulting cholera, anthrax, and plague were {{estimated to have}} killed around and possibly more than 400,000 Chinese civilians. <b>Tularemia</b> was tested on Chinese civilians.|$|E
25|$|Diseases {{considered}} for or {{known to be}} used as a weapon include anthrax, ebola, Marburg virus, plague, cholera, typhus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, <b>tularemia,</b> brucellosis, Q fever, machupo, Coccidioides mycosis, Glanders, Melioidosis, Shigella, Psittacosis, Japanese B encephalitis, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, and smallpox.|$|E
25|$|Tetracyclines {{remain the}} {{treatment}} of choice for infections caused by chlamydia (trachoma, psittacosis, salpingitis, urethritis and L. venereum infection), Rickettsia (typhus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), brucellosis and spirochetal infections (borreliosis, syphilis and Lyme disease). In addition, they {{may be used to}} treat anthrax, plague, <b>tularemia</b> and Legionnaires' disease. They are also used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|Prairie {{dogs are}} also very {{susceptible}} to bubonic plague, and many wild colonies have been wiped out by it. Also, in 2002, {{a large group of}} prairie dogs in captivity in Texas were found to have contracted <b>tularemia.</b> The prairie dog ban is frequently cited by the CDC as a successful response to the threat of zoonosis.|$|E
25|$|Some {{parasitic}} forms affect {{humans and}} other mammals, causing damage by their feeding, {{and can even}} be vectors of diseases, such as scrub typhus, rickettsialpox, Lyme disease, Q fever, Colorado tick fever, <b>tularemia,</b> tick-borne relapsing fever, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis and tick-borne meningoencephalitis. A well known effect of mites on humans is their role as an allergen and the stimulation of asthma in people affected by respiratory disease.|$|E
25|$|Swine plague spreads {{very quickly}} in wild boar, with {{epizootics}} being recorded in Germany, Poland, Hungary, Belarus, the Caucasus, the Far East, Kazakhstan, and other regions. Foot-and-mouth disease {{can also take}} on epidemic proportions in boar populations. The species occasionally, but rarely contracts Pasteurellosis, hemorrhagic septicemia, <b>tularemia</b> and anthrax. Wild boar may on occasion contract swine erysipelas through rodents or hog lice and ticks.|$|E
25|$|Black-footed ferrets are {{susceptible}} to numerous diseases. They are fatally susceptible to canine distemper virus, introduced by striped skunks, common raccoons, red foxes, coyotes, and American badgers. A short-term vaccine for canine distemper is available for captive black-footed ferrets, but no protection is available for young born in the wild. Black-footed ferrets are also susceptible to rabies, <b>tularemia,</b> and human influenza. They can directly contract sylvatic plague (Yersinia pestis), and epidemics in prairie dog towns may completely destroy the ferrets' prey base.|$|E
25|$|With {{the onset}} of World War II, the Ministry of Supply in the United Kingdom {{established}} a BW program at Porton Down, headed by the microbiologist Paul Fildes. The research was championed by Winston Churchill and soon <b>tularemia,</b> anthrax, brucellosis, and botulism toxins had been effectively weaponized. In particular, Gruinard Island in Scotland, was contaminated with anthrax during a series of extensive tests for the next 56 years. Although the UK never offensively used the biological weapons it developed on its own, its program {{was the first to}} successfully weaponize a variety of deadly pathogens and bring them into industrial production. Other nations, notably France and Japan, had begun their own biological weapons programs.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1960s, the {{chemical}} warfare capabilities of the United States began to decline due to, in part, a decline in public opinion concerning the corps. The corps continued to be plagued with bad press and mishaps. A 1969 incident, in which 23 soldiers and one Japanese civilian were exposed to sarin {{on the island of}} Okinawa while cleaning sarin-filled bombs, created international concern while revealing the presence of chemical munitions in Southeast Asia. The same year as this sarin mishap, President Richard Nixon reaffirmed a no first-use policy on chemical weapons as well as renouncing the use of biological agents. When the U.S. BW program ended in 1969, it had developed seven standardized biological weapons in the form of agents that cause anthrax, <b>tularemia,</b> brucellosis, Q-fever, VEE, and botulism. In addition, Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B was produced as an incapacitating agent.|$|E
25|$|During most {{of human}} {{prehistory}} groups of hunter-gatherers were probably very small. Such groups probably {{made contact with}} other such bands only rarely. Such isolation would have caused epidemic diseases to be restricted to any given local population, because propagation and expansion of epidemics depend on frequent contact with other individuals {{who have not yet}} developed an adequate immune response. To persist in such a population, a pathogen either had to be a chronic infection, staying present and potentially infectious in the infected host for long periods, or it had to have other additional species as reservoir where it can maintain itself until further susceptible hosts are contacted and infected. In fact, for many 'human' diseases, the human is actually better viewed as an accidental or incidental victim and a dead-end host. Examples include rabies, anthrax, <b>tularemia</b> and West Nile virus. Thus, much of human exposure to infectious disease has been zoonotic.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{there are}} some reports of an active {{biological}} weapons research and production program. According to NATO Consultant Dr Jill Dekker, Syria has worked on: anthrax, plague, <b>tularemia,</b> botulism, smallpox, aflatoxin, cholera, ricin and camelpox, and has used Russian help in installing anthrax in missile warheads. She also stated [...] "they view their bio-chemical arsenal {{as part of a}} normal weapons program".|$|E
2500|$|... and {{proteomics}} with bioinformatics strategies. Many exciting {{developments in}} large-scale screening of pathogens are currently taking place. [...] has initiated an endeavor for systematic mapping of B and T cell epitopes of category A-C pathogens. These pathogens include Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), Clostridium botulinum toxin (botulism), Variola major (smallpox), Francisella tularensis (<b>tularemia),</b> viral hemorrhagic fevers, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Staphylococcus enterotoxin B, yellow fever, influenza, rabies, Chikungunya virus etc. Rule-based {{systems have been}} reported for the automated extraction and curation of influenza A records.|$|E
50|$|The studies {{about the}} {{epidemiology}} of <b>tularemia</b> {{continued in the}} years thereafter as well. The first report of a human case of <b>tularemia</b> was in 1980 in Marivan, southwestern Kurdistan province.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tularemia,</b> a {{bacterial}} disease caused by Francisella tularensis, is variously transmitted, including by biting flies. Culex and Culiseta are vectors of <b>tularemia,</b> {{as well as}} arbovirus infections such as West Nile virus.|$|E
50|$|The black-tailed jackrabbit plays host to many ectoparasites {{including}} fleas, ticks, lice, and mites, {{and many}} endoparasites including trematodes, cestodes, nematodes, and botfly (Cuterebra) larvae. Diseases affecting the black-tailed jackrabbit in the West are <b>tularemia,</b> equine encephalitis, brucellosis, Q fever, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Ticks are vectors for <b>tularemia,</b> and infected ticks {{have been found}} on jackrabbits in the West. Jackrabbits infected with <b>tularemia</b> die very quickly.|$|E
5000|$|Around 1950 the Chemical Corps also {{initiated}} {{a program to}} weaponize <b>tularemia</b> (UL). Shortly after the E61/N failed to make standardization, <b>tularemia</b> was standardized in the 3.4" [...] M143 bursting spherical bomblet. This was intended for delivery by the MGM-29 Sergeant missile warhead and could produce 50% infection over a 7 sq mi area. Although <b>tularemia</b> is treatable by antibiotics, treatment does not shorten {{the course of the}} disease. US conscientious objectors were used as consenting test subjects for <b>tularemia</b> in a program known as Operation Whitecoat. There were also many unpublicized tests carried out in public places with bio-agent simulants during the Cold War.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tularemia</b> was {{allegedly}} used against German troops in 1942 near Stalingrad. Around 10,000 cases of <b>tularemia</b> {{had been reported}} in the Soviet Union between 1941 and 1943. However, the number of cases jumped to more than 100,000 in the year of the Stalingrad outbreak. German Panzer troops fell ill in such significant numbers during the late summer of 1942 that the German military campaign came to a temporary halt. German soldiers became ill with the rare pulmonary form of <b>tularemia,</b> which may indicate the use of an aerosol biological weapon (the ordinary transmission pathway is through ticks and rodents). According to Kenneth Alibek, the used <b>tularemia</b> weapon had been developed in the Kirov military facility. [...] It was suggested by some, however, that the outbreak might have been of natural origin, since a pulmonary form of <b>tularemia</b> has also been noted in natural outbreaks in Martha's Vineyard in 2000.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Tularemia</b> - <b>Tularemia</b> is {{also known}} as [...] "rabbit fever" [...] or [...] "deer fly fever" [...] and is {{extremely}} infectious. Relatively few bacteria are required to cause the disease, which is why it is an attractive weapon for use in bioterrorism.|$|E
50|$|In January 2011, {{researchers}} {{searching for}} brucellosis among feral hog populations in Texas discovered widespread <b>tularemia</b> infection or evidence of past infection in feral hog populations {{of at least}} two Texas counties, even though <b>tularemia</b> is not normally associated with pigs at all. Precautions were recommended for those who hunt, dress, or prepare feral hogs. Since feral hogs roam over large distances, concern exists that <b>tularemia</b> may spread or already be present in feral hogs over a wide geographic area.|$|E
