5|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} balance issues, {{the game was}} initially very difficult, especially in the later stages. Nakamura had written a program that simulated every single combat {{that he used to}} adjust the games setting for character leveling and the strength of enemies players would encounter. This program failed to account for larger monster groups, however, which fell outside the model and caused the game to be very difficult. Further more, enemies leveling and weapons power were designed by area, but Koichi Nakamura didn't <b>think</b> <b>over</b> the boat, so if player get the boat to some land might be quickly killed. The developers realized there was a balance problem and did some modifications, such as limiting the number of enemies in Midenhall to groups of three, and moving the Cannock Castle closer to Midenhall Castle.|$|E

500|$|Trescothick {{was unable}} to avoid a {{recurrence}} of his previous difficulties when travelling abroad, however, and returned home on 15 October, citing the same [...] "stress related illness". Brian Rose, who Trescothick had approached initially after Somerset's defeat by Trinidad and Tobago on 12 October, released {{a statement to the}} media stating [...] "Marcus admitted {{a couple of days ago}} that he wasn't 100% so that's fair enough.

[...] Michael Vaughan, who had by then retired from cricket, praised Trescothick's [...] "courageous" [...] decision, as did Vikram Solanki, then PCA chairman. Journalist Andrew Miller called for an end to the rising criticism of Trescothick's decision from the public, while Paul Hayward of the Guardian also derided those critical of the Somerset player's actions. Despite returning home, Trescothick continued to affirm his commitment to the club by signing a new three-year contract with optional fourth year, in December. He was named captain for the 2010 season.|$|E

500|$|... Darwin's {{belief that}} black people had the same {{essential}} humanity as Europeans, and had many mental similarities, was reinforced by the lessons he had from John Edmonstone in 1826. Early in the Beagle voyage, Darwin nearly lost {{his position on the}} ship when he criticised FitzRoy's defence and praise of slavery. [...] He wrote home about [...] "how steadily the general feeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against Slavery. What a proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which utterly abolishes it! I was told before leaving England that after living in slave countries all my opinions would be altered; the only alteration I am aware of is forming a much higher estimate of the negro character." [...] Regarding Fuegians, he [...] "could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement", but he knew and liked civilised Fuegians like Jemmy Button: [...] "It seems yet wonderful to me, when I <b>think</b> <b>over</b> all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here." ...|$|E
500|$|They reached Tierra del Fuego on 18 December 1832 and Darwin {{was taken}} aback at what he {{perceived}} as the crude savagery of the Yaghan natives, {{in stark contrast to}} the [...] "civilised" [...] behaviour of the three Fuegians they were returning as missionaries (who had been given the names York Minster, Fuegia Basket and Jemmy Button). He described his first meeting with the native Fuegians as being [...] "without exception the most curious and interesting spectacle I ever beheld: I could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilised man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement." [...] In contrast, he said of Jemmy that [...] "It seems yet wonderful to me, when I <b>think</b> <b>over</b> all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here." [...] (Four decades later, he recalled these impressions in The Descent of Man to support his argument that just as humans had descended from [...] "a lower form", civilised society had arisen by graduations from a more primitive state. He recalled how closely the Fuegians on board the Beagle [...] "resembled us in disposition and in most of our mental faculties.") ...|$|E

He returned to Scotland only twice, in 1932 and again in 1939. On one occasion {{he was asked if}} he ever regretted his decision to leave behind the fame and glory of athletics. Liddell responded, [...] "It's natural for a chap to <b>think</b> <b>over</b> all that sometimes, but I'm glad I'm at the work I'm engaged in now.

2500|$|This way of {{operating}} {{does not seem}} to have originated with the gang led by Niers and Sumer; apparently, Niers had a mentor in crime called Martin Stier, who from the 1550s until his arrest and execution in 1572 had led a gang of 49 bandits ostensibly working as shepherds, murdering and robbing their way from the Netherlands to Württemberg. Wiltenburg adds that, [...] "Shepherds were widely regarded as dishonourable, especially in the thinking of urban guilds." [...] She proffers an example of such thinking from a novel published in 1554, where the young antihero gradually slides down the social scale to that of a herdsman, and finally hits the bottom as a wandering minstrel. [...] "Far from civilized society and alone with the animals, he has time to <b>think</b> <b>over</b> his misdeeds. Members of such a group were unsurprising suspects".|$|E

State of Nebraska in New York City, leading a new journey for the Lakota people when they crossed the sea to England on Buffalo Bill’s first international to perform at the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria and tour through Birmingham, Salford and London over a five–month period. The entourage consisted of 97 Indians, 18 buffaloes, 2 deer, 10 elk, 10 mules, 5 Texas steers, 4 donkeys, and 108 horses.|$|E

2500|$|Competitive chess became {{visible in}} 1834 with the LaBourdonnais-McDonnel matches, and the 1851 London Chess tournament raised {{concerns}} about the time taken by the players to deliberate their moves. On recording time {{it was found that}} players often took hours to analyze moves, and one player took as much as two hours and 20 minutes to <b>think</b> <b>over</b> a single move at the London tournament. The following years saw the development of speed chess, five-minute chess and the most popular variant, a version allowing a bank of time to each player in which to play a previously agreed number of moves, e.g. two hours for 30 moves. In the final variant, the player who made the predetermined number of moves in the agreed time received additional time budget for his next moves. Penalties for exceeding a time limit came in form of fines and forfeiture. Since fines were easy to bear for professional players, forfeiture became the only effective penalty; this added [...] "lost on time" [...] to the traditional means of losing such as checkmate and resigning.|$|E
2500|$|The Canbys next {{moved to}} Portland, Oregon where the general became {{commander}} of the Department of Columbia. This Pacific Northwest command encompassed Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. In 1872 the Modoc War broke out, involving both Oregon and northern California. On April 11, 1873, Modoc leader Kintpuash (also known as Captain Jack) killed the unarmed Canby and several members of his party during peace talks. Canby had written frankly to Louisa about his misapprehensions over the negotiations with the Modocs. A chief concern (which proved to be prophetic) was that Captain Jack so feared treachery {{that he might be}} capable of committing treachery preemptively. On the day of his death Canby received a letter from his wife in Portland. She had written, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>over</b> all sorts of Modoc treachery till I am becoming a nervous, hysterical woman and will have to get away from Oregon to get over it." [...] Louisa found her husband's death so unbearable that she spent a week in bed. His body was shuttled from place to place {{for more than a month}} before it reached Indianapolis, Indiana, and was finally buried at Crown Hill Cemetery. With the support of her brother, Colonel John Hawkins, Louisa devoted the last sixteen years of her life to promoting the memory of her husband.|$|E
