5|$|The {{captured}} Lane expresses {{his belief}} that Jones is helping the prime universe to defeat the parallel one. Olivia tries to convince him of Jones' true intentions. Eventually, Lane agrees to show the Fringe team a location where he once met with Jones. The team raids the site but finds nothing; meanwhile, Lane escapes custody using his abilities. With only hours left until <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> quakes, as projected by a watch that Lane was wearing, plans are made {{to shut down the}} bridge before this time runs out.|$|E
5|$|Believing that {{by taking}} {{in one of}} the Cortexiphan {{subjects}} they can stop the effects of another quake, a willing Lane from the parallel universe travels to the prime and is hooked to Walter's (John Noble) equipment. Olivia also hooks herself up, allowing her to communicate what she sees in Lane's mind. When the prime version of Lane attempts to get into the right position, Olivia is able to identify his location, and he is captured in time. However, despite disrupting the process for Lane, earthquakes continue across the world. Walter estimates that <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> quakes will cause both universes to collapse.|$|E

5|$|The Genesee Wesleyan Seminary {{was founded}} in 1831 by the Genesee Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Lima, New York, south of Rochester. In 1850, it was {{resolved}} to enlarge the institution from a seminary into a college, or to connect a college with the seminary, becoming Genesee College. However, the location was soon thought {{by many to be}} insufficiently central. Its difficulties were compounded by <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> technological changes: the railroad that displaced the Erie Canal as the region's economic engine bypassed Lima completely. The trustees of the struggling college then decided to seek a locale whose economic and transportation advantages could provide a better base of support.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{political}} pressure, the MoD continued to lack confidence in UNAMSIL leadership. Thus, the British government refused to place combat troops under UN command, but did second additional staff officers to UNAMSIL, to the UN headquarters in New York, {{and to the}} SLA. The officers attached to UNAMSIL were tasked with assisting its commanders in planning and mounting operations and were led by a brigadier who became UNAMSIL's chief of staff, while in New York, the officers attached to UN headquarters provided planning support for logistics operations to bring UNAMSIL up to its mandated strength. At the same time, {{the focus of the}} British training programme shifted. Although six battalions had been trained, the SLA still lacked many combat support functions as well as command and control capabilities. The STTTs set out to improve the SLA's capabilities in these areas by providing <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> recruits with more specialised training in addition to basic infantry training provided to the first intake. The British trainers also constructed an operations room at the SLA's headquarters and provided other support to improve the SLA's communications and logistical capabilities.|$|E

30|$|Based on our prior work [9], a novel {{progressive}} DVC {{architecture is}} proposed {{to mitigate the}} limitations of such blind motion estimation and to further explore the intrinsic spatial redundancy of each frame. The proposed side information refinement (SIR) technique works as follows. Each WZ frame is divided into blocks, and the blocks themselves are grouped into two, three, or four spatially correlated sets. The first <b>set</b> <b>of</b> blocks {{is sent to the}} receiver and is then used for side information refinement <b>of</b> the second <b>set.</b> The SIR is based on the spatial correlation between the first decoded set and the upcoming second set. Thus, the second <b>set</b> <b>of</b> blocks will require lower bitrates since the side information will be affected with less distortion after the first pass of refinement. The SIR process is repeated for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> blocks using all the previously decoded sets, thus benefitting more and more from the video frame’s spatial correlation.|$|R
40|$|Radio {{signatures}} of lightning discharges on Saturn have first been {{discovered by the}} Voyager spacecraft in 1980 / 81. After the Voyager flybys, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> measurements only became available in 2004, when the Cassini spacecraft approached Saturn. Since then, Cassini provides continuous monitoring of Saturn’s lightning activity. In 2006, ground-based observations became available as a complementary source of information. Using a new broadband receiver at the UTR- 2 radio telescope (Ukraine), Saturn lightning was observed over the whole spectral range of the instrument (10 - 30 MHz). This allows study of the temporal fine structure of the emission with a much finer temporal resolution {{than that of the}} routine satellite observations. More recently, Saturn lightning was also observed by two further ground-based radiotelescopes, namely WSRT (the Netherlands) and LOFAR (Europe). We present first results of recent ground-based observations of Saturn lightning performed with the radiotelescopes UTR- 2, WSRT and LOFAR, and we describe the aims of future observations using these instruments...|$|R
5|$|In a Schrödinger's cat-like situation, {{immediately}} {{prior to}} the start of the Nonary Game, Dio either murdered the old woman and took her place in the game, or failed to do so but was still placed into the game by her and later planted the bombs. In the timeline leading to the game's ultimate ending, Sigma defuses the bombs, while Dio is restrained and incapacitated. The remaining participants proceed to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> puzzle rooms. As Sigma, Phi, and Tenmyouji complete their room, they uncover a holographic message of the old woman, Akane Kurashiki, whom Tenmyouji – revealed to be the player character Junpei from Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors – was seeking. Akane and Zero Sr. had developed the AB project, a project that encompassed the Nonary Game and the Ambidex Game, to train Sigma and Phi to transport their consciousnesses through time. This occurs shortly thereafter, and Phi subdues Dio before he can kill Akane. Akane explains that the game's dangerous elements were necessary to speed up one's brain to transport one's consciousness through time, and each participant was infected with Radical-6 to amplify this increase. The Nonary Game was designed so Sigma and Phi could experience multiple timelines and retain what they learn in each one. Sigma and Phi's consciousnesses are then returned to the present, where they find everyone has cooperated to acquire enough points to escape.|$|E
5|$|Random, {{isolated}} cirrus do {{not have}} any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign of an approaching frontal system or upper air disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a cirrus castellanus, there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus fibratus species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and altostratus. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds. When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.|$|E
5|$|With 2:05 {{left in the}} game, Cutler began {{leading a}} two-minute drill: after a six-yard run by Forte, {{followed}} by a sack by Mack and incomplete pass to Josh Bellamy to bring up fourth down, Cutler successfully converted with a seven-yard pass to Bennett, who beat Keenan Lambert. Cutler's next pass to Marquess Wilson fell incomplete, and Forte's seven-yard run led to another third-down situation, which led to Cutler's first-down conversion of seven yards to Wilson with 56 seconds left. On <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> downs, Cutler's pass for receiver Cameron Meredith was overthrown, though a 12-yard pass to Royal allowed the offense to enter Oakland territory, where the Bears elected to use a timeout with 40 seconds remaining. The offense entered field goal range with Cutler's nine-yard pass to Wilson, followed by a two-yard run by Forte. With seven seconds left, the Bears used another timeout, and allowed Gould to attempt the 49-yard field goal; Gould successfully converted the field goal with two seconds remaining on the clock to give the Bears the 22–20 lead. In an last-second attempt to score, the Raiders attempted lateral passes on the kickoff return, but were penalized for an illegal lateral {{in the early stages}} of the play, and the Bears eventually recovered to clinch the win.|$|E

For most analyses, the common finding was that of individual variability- in respect to preferred practice types, to their relative frequencies in solitary or social contexts, and to the choice of model in own or in other's speech. Some trends, however, did emerge. First, a higher percentage of crib speech than of social-context speech was devoted to the linguistic practice types.

25|$|Roll forging is {{a process}} where round or flat bar stock is reduced in {{thickness}} and increased in length. Roll forging is performed using two cylindrical or semi-cylindrical rolls, each containing one or more shaped grooves. A heated bar is inserted into the rolls and when it hits a spot the rolls rotate and the bar is progressively shaped as it is rolled through the machine. The piece is then transferred to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> grooves or turned around and reinserted into the same grooves. This continues until the desired shape and size is achieved. The advantage {{of this process is}} there is no flash and it imparts a favorable grain structure into the workpiece.|$|E
