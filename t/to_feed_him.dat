Upon reading them, Gary realizes that SpongeBob truly loves him and wants him back. He tries to leave, but instead of doing that, he ends up going to the closet, filled with empty snail shells. When the old lady tries <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>him</b> again, Gary finds that the old lady most likely has {{sinister}} motives—she is possibly trying to fatten and then eat him.

25|$|Another {{example of}} Durvasa's benevolent {{side is the}} {{incident}} when he granted Duryodhana a boon. During the Pandavas' exile, Durvasa and several disciples arrived at Hastinapura. Duryodhana with his maternal uncle Shakuni managed to gratify the sage. Durvasa was pleased enough to grant him a boon.

25|$|Bo Yibo {{was born}} in Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi, which {{had become one of}} the poorest provinces in China by the early 20th century. His father was a {{craftsman}} who produced paper, but the family was so poor that they were forced to drown one of Bo's newborn brothers because they were not wealthy enough <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>him.</b> As a student, Bo was politically active, and once organized a protest against local land taxes.

25|$|Cline's privately {{published}} work Hope for high risk and rage filled children also cites family therapist and hypnotherapist Milton Erickson as a source, and reprints {{parts of a}} case of Erickson's published in 1961. The report describes {{the case of a}} divorced mother with a non-compliant son. Erickson advised the mother to sit on the child {{for hours at a time}} and <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>him</b> only on cold oatmeal while she and a daughter ate appetizing food. The child did increase in compliance, and Erickson noted, with apparent approval, that he trembled when his mother looked at him. Cline commented, with respect to this and other cases, that in his opinion all bonds were trauma bonds. According to Cline, it illustrates the three essential components of 1) taking control, 2) the child's expression of rage; and, 3) relaxation and the development of bonding.|$|E

25|$|On February 3, Bryant made seven three-pointers {{and scored}} a season-high 38 points, {{including}} 14 of the team's 18 {{points in the}} last 5:02 of the game, for a 119–115 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. The win ended a 10-game losing streak, and the Lakers averted establishing the longest losing streak in franchise history. Bryant became just the fourth NBA player over 37 years old to log at least 35 points, five rebounds, and five assists in a game. Bryant was the leading overall vote-getter for the 2016 All-Star Game with 1.9 million votes, ahead of Stephen Curry's 1.6 million. Having moved to small forward that season, Bryant was selected as a frontcourt starter for the first time. Playing in his first All-Star game since 2013, Bryant had 10 points, six rebounds, and seven assists. West teammates offered <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>him</b> the ball {{in an attempt to}} get him another All-Star MVP, but he declined.|$|E

500|$|Kafka's {{laryngeal}} tuberculosis worsened and in March 1924 {{he returned}} from Berlin to Prague, where members of his family, principally his sister Ottla, took care of him. He went to Dr. Hoffmann's sanatorium in Kierling just outside Vienna for treatment on 10 April, and died there on 3 June 1924. The cause of death seemed to be starvation: the condition of Kafka's throat made eating too painful for him, and since parenteral nutrition {{had not yet been}} developed, there was no way <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>him.</b> Kafka was editing [...] "A Hunger Artist" [...] on his deathbed, a story whose composition he had begun before his throat closed to the point that he could not take any nourishment. His body was brought back to Prague where he was buried on 11 June 1924, in the New Jewish Cemetery in Prague-Žižkov. Kafka was unknown during his own lifetime, but he did not consider fame important. He became famous soon after his death. The Kafka tombstone was designed by architect Leopold Ehrmann.|$|E

500|$|Brian Donlevy as Professor Bernard Quatermass: Donlevy reprised {{his role}} as the eponymous professor, much to the despair of Nigel Kneale, who had heavily criticised his {{interpretation}} of the role in The Quatermass Xperiment. As had been the case on The Quatermass Xperiment, Donlevy's alcoholism presented challenges for the production. Nigel Kneale recalled visiting the set one day: “He [...] was so full of whiskey he could hardly stand up. He staggered over to the set and looked dazedly around. They held up an idiot board with his lines on and he said, “What's this movie called?” and they said, “Well, it's called Quatermass 2”. He said, “I've got to say all that? There's too much talk. Cut down some of the talk”. He tried to read it and he had to have go after go after go, so crippled with drink he hardly knew who he was”. Val Guest has denied Kneale's claims, saying “So many stories have been concocted since, about how he was a paralytic. It's absolute balls, because he was not paralytic. He wasn't stone cold sober either, but he was a pro and he knew his lines”. Guest also recalled, “By after lunch he would come to me and say “Give me a breakdown of the story so far. Where have I just been before this scene?” We used <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>him</b> black coffee all morning but then we discovered he was lacing it. But he was a very professional actor and very easy to work with”.|$|E

Peter Rogers, the producer of the Carry On films and shows, explained: [...] "He became rather difficult and impossible to deal with because he was drinking a lot. We used <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>him</b> black coffee before he would go on. It really became that we were wasting time." [...] Hawtrey's alcohol consumption had noticeably increased since Carry On Cowboy (1965), which was released the year his mother died.|$|E
2500|$|After {{recovering}} from his wounds, Sendashonga carried out {{his plan to}} start the FRD opposition party in Brussels. [...] French historian Gérard Prunier states that the party platform, which included an in-depth critique of the 1994 genocide, was [...] "a very valuable contribution {{because it was an}} honest and realistic assessment of the genocide from a mostly Hutu political group." [...] However, Sendashonga's assertion that the enemy was not the Tutsi, but rather the RPF under Kagame, was subject to harsh criticism by other Hutu politicians who accused him of being weak. [...] Conversely, Sendashonga said of the former genocidaire Hutu leadership in refugee camps of Zaire, [...] "Their only political program is to kill Tutsis." [...] At the same time, several of his old Tutsi colleagues in the RPF continued <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>him</b> information about events within Rwanda, apparently in the belief that he would be needed once again once the violence had run its course.|$|E

2500|$|Van Vliet's artistic enthusiasm {{became so}} fervent, {{he claimed that}} his parents were forced <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>him</b> through {{the door in the}} room where he sculpted. When he was {{thirteen}} the family moved from the Los Angeles area to the more remote farming town of Lancaster, near the Mojave Desert, where there was a growing aerospace industry and testing plant that would become Edwards Air Force Base. It was an environment that would greatly influence him creatively from then on. Van Vliet remained interested in art; several of his paintings, often reminiscent of Franz Kline's, were later used as front covers for his music albums. Meanwhile, he developed his taste and interest in music, listening [...] "intensively" [...] to the Delta blues of Son House and Robert Johnson, jazz artists such as Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and Cecil Taylor, and the Chicago blues of Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters. During his early teenage years, Vliet would sometimes socialize with members of local bands such as the Omens and the [...] Blackouts, although his interests were still focused upon an art career. The Omens' guitarists Alexis Snouffer and Jerry Handley would later become founders of [...] "the Magic Band" [...] and the Blackouts' drummer, Frank Zappa, would later capture Vliet's vocal capabilities on record for the first time. This first known recording, when he was simply [...] "Don Vliet", is [...] "Lost In A Whirlpool" [...] – one of Zappa's early [...] "field recordings" [...] made in his college classroom with brother Bobby on guitar.
