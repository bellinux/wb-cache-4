25|$|On 2 April 2003, Southend Council {{unanimously}} {{rejected the}} planning application as the airport {{had not given}} sufficient reasons to require disturbing a 1,000-year-old building and because the proposal was in breach {{of several of the}} council's planning guidelines and the district plan. In August 2003, the airport announced plans <b>to</b> <b>lodge</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> against the decision of the local council.|$|E

5000|$|In 2016, {{five members}} of CoWPB were {{suspended}} by Pipe Bands Australia (PBA) for making a relatively innocuous but derogatory comment on the band's private Facebook page. The five members (including the Pipe Major and Drum Sergeant) subsequently resigned their membership of PBA prior <b>to</b> <b>lodging</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal.</b> The band then resigned its membership of the PBA before accepting an offer to renew its membership/registration {{in order to be}} eligible to compete at the Australian Pipe Band Championships held on 2-3 October at Knox College, Sydney. However, at the 2016 Australian Championships, CoWPB was disqualified mid-way through the competition when [...] "members of the public" [...] assisted the band in the tuning-up area (it was obvious to spectators that other competing pipe bands also received assistance in tuning up from [...] "members of the public" [...] but were not penalised or disqualified). The band's membership of PBA was subsequently annulled and the band deregistered. This episode in Australian pipe band history, is unparalleled, with the PBA Executive punishing the many innocent and dedicated playing members of CoWPB for what {{can only be described as}} a relatively trivial, if ill-advised remark on the band's private Facebook page.|$|R
50|$|In January 2012, Bahmanzadeh {{applied to}} the Criminal Cases Review Commission (C.R.C.C.) for the right <b>to</b> <b>lodge</b> <b>a</b> further <b>appeal</b> against his {{conviction}} and sentence, {{on the grounds that}} new evidence had come to light which cast doubt on the reliability of a key prosecution witness at the original trial. The C.R.C.C. accepted that there were grounds for <b>a</b> fresh <b>appeal</b> and on 26 January they referred Bahmanzadeh's conviction and sentence to the Court of Appeal. Bahmanzadeh was released from prison on bail on 13 July 2012; he had been serving his sentence at Ford Open prison while working on day-release at a Brighton charity shop.|$|R
25|$|Sandiford {{had seven}} days <b>to</b> <b>lodge</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> {{following}} the sentence. An initial letter of appeal drafted by diplomats {{was rejected by}} court officials because guidelines require an appeal to be filed from the prison. On 28 January Gede Ketut Rantam, registrar of Denpasar District Court in Bali confirmed his office had received an appeal request from Sandiford. She was then given a further fourteen days to file a more detailed appeal. The appellate system of Indonesia has three levels; the High Court, the Supreme Court, and a direct appeal for clemency to the President.|$|E
25|$|Following the decision, {{a second}} {{judicial}} appeal was launched by Mike Hulme, which challenged {{the validity of}} the planning conditions and claimed that the wording of the noise conditions rendered them ineffective. The case was heard by Judge Frances Patterson QC in July 2010. All ten grounds of the challenge were rejected by the judge in her decision. Hulme went on <b>to</b> <b>lodge</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> against this decision, which was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in May 2011. Subsequently, RES sought agreement with WDBC on how the planning conditions would be met.|$|E
2500|$|Bali's High Court {{announced}} on 8 April 2013 that Sandiford's appeal {{had been denied}} and her conviction and death sentence upheld.

50|$|Tuggeranong United was {{the first}} club from Canberra to {{represent}} the ACT in the inaugural FFA Cup. Tuggers were not originally going to represent the nation’s capital when Capital Football decided a pre-season cup competition in 2014 would decide who would represent the ACT, rather than last season’s Federation Cup champions. Tuggeranong United were the 2013 Federation Cup champions after beating Cooma 3-2, and upon hearing the initial decision by Capital Football, decided <b>to</b> <b>lodge</b> <b>a</b> formal <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> the federation to change their mind. With rival clubs backing, the appeal was successful at a Capital Football board meeting on 18 February 2014 and federation put Tuggeranong forward as the ACT representative on the proviso of finding a more suitable venue to host matches given Kambah 2 has only basic amenities and inadequate lighting. This decision directly affected 2014 Federation Cup winners, Belconnen United FC, as the blue devils missed out on qualification to the FFA Cup.|$|R
2500|$|On 26 October 2010, the Iraqi High Tribunal {{handed down}} a death {{sentence}} against Aziz for the offense of [...] "persecution of Islamic parties," [...] amongst them the serving Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's Islamic Dawa Party, following a crackdown on a Shia uprising after the 1991 Gulf War. The Associated Press reports that [...] "the judge gave no details of Aziz's specific role" [...] in the crackdown. His lawyer stated that Tariq Aziz's role in the former Iraqi government was {{in the arena of}} [...] "Iraq's diplomatic and political relations only, and {{had nothing to do with}} the executions and purges carried during Hussein's reign." [...] His lawyer further stated that the death sentence itself was politically motivated and that timing of the death sentence may have been aimed at diverting international attention away from documents released by WikiLeaks, which detailed crimes in which Maliki government officials have been implicated. His lawyers have 30 days <b>to</b> <b>lodge</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal,</b> following which the court would have another 30 days to look into the appeal; if the appeal is turned down the sentence would be carried out after another 30 days. On 26 October 2010 the Vatican urged the Iraqi government not to carry out his execution, and European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton stated that Aziz's execution would be [...] "unacceptable and the EU will seek to commute his sentence." [...] That same day, the human rights organization Amnesty International issued a statement condemning the use of the death penalty in this case, as well as for the cases of two other former Iraqi officials; the statement also expressed concern regarding the manner in which trials may have been conducted by the Iraqi High Tribunal. On 27 October 2010, Greek President Karolos Papoulias and the Russian Foreign Ministry both released statements urging the Iraqi government not to carry out the death penalty against Tariq Aziz. Also on 27 October 2010, a spokesperson for United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon was reported to have [...] "stressed that the UN is against the death sentence and in this case, as in all others, it is calling for the verdict to be cancelled." [...] On 28 October 2010, it was reported that some Iraqi Bishops and many ordinary Iraqis also condemned the death penalty for Tariq Aziz. Furthermore, according to the Wall Street Journal, [...] "several international human-rights groups have criticised the procedures and questioned the impartiality of the court." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{motion for}} new trial asks to {{overturn}} or {{set aside a}} court's decision or jury verdict. Such a motion is proposed by a party who is dissatisfied with {{the end result of}} a case. This motion must be based on some vital error in the court's handling of the trial, such as the admission or exclusion of key evidence, or an incorrect instruction to the jury. Generally the motion is filed within a short time after the trial (7-30 days) and is decided prior <b>to</b> the <b>lodging</b> of <b>an</b> <b>appeal.</b> In some jurisdictions, a motion for new trial which is not ruled upon by a set period of time automatically is deemed to be denied.|$|R
