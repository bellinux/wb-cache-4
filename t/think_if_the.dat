500|$|... "Jump the Shark" [...] {{was written}} by Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, and Frank Spotnitz; it was {{directed}} by Cliff Bole. The episode proved difficult to make. After the cancellation of The Lone Gunmen television series, which aired in 2001, Fox reportedly [...] "hated [...] characters". Executive producer and co-writer Frank Spotnitz had to fight to get the episode made; the studio informed Spotnitz {{that they did not}} want to bring the characters back in any capacity in the ninth season. Actor Bruce Harwood later explained that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> studio objected to anything, it was wasting time on our characters long enough to kill us off." [...] Co-writer Gilligan later recalled [...] "The Lone Gunmen was still kind of an open wound for me." [...] Thus, the episode was crafted as a way to wrap up the series. Due to the nature of the episode—which effectively works as a tie-in—various long-term characters from both The X-Files and The Lone Gunmen make cameo appearances.|$|E
500|$|Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune said [...] "Spears {{delivers}} a performance {{with the same}} sincerity she invests into a Pepsi commercial, only this film contains twice the sugary calories", while New York Daily News writer Elizabeth Weitzma noted, [...] "Here's what Crossroads does not have: Cohesive direction from Tamra Davis, intelligent dialogue, a comprehensible plot". Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide commented that [...] "the film's mealy-mouthed messages about feminine empowerment will almost certainly fall on deaf ears, since even 11-year-olds know Spears's power resides largely in her taut torso". Claudia Puig of USA Today considered it [...] "less a movie than a mind-numbingly dull road trip", while The Washington Post reporter Ann Hornaday said, [...] "not a music video, not yet a movie, but more like an extended-play advertisement for the Product that is Britney". Jane Dark of Village Voice compared Crossroads to Mariah Carey's Glitter, saying, [...] "you {{spend a lot of}} time wondering, 'Better or worse than Glitter?' You <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> projectionist cranked the volume a little you could actually sort of get into this".|$|E
2500|$|Do you <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{election}} of 1984 {{had not been}} a snap election, there would have been time for the opposing forces within the party to have successfully blocked the reforms or to have severely limited them? ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked in}} May 2012 {{about the future}} status of Army of Anyone, Luzier reiterated Patrick's {{comments}} {{that they were still}} in contact, and even stated there was music they were working on, responding, [...] "It’s possible. We are all really good friends. We have a bunch of tunes in the works. I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> time ever arose where we all could make our schedules fit, it would work out." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Bellisario {{said that}} he [...] "kind of [...] what's going on now" [...] {{and that it was}} {{unlikely}} that the relationship would be taken further any time in the immediate future. De Pablo agreed, saying, [...] "I would <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> characters get together, the whole mystery would be done. I {{think it will be a}} lot more fun to play the tension." [...] She elaborated in another interview, [...] "My character has sort of this understated flirtation with Michael's character, Tony. She gets jealous, but I think she would never admit it or hook up with someone in the workplace. He scares her to death. He is the epitome of the American man and all of the things that come out of his mouth are brutally stupid." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{from page}} 222 of her book, Esoteric Healing and it {{provides}} context for the criticisms that follow. [...] "...Inter-marriage between nations and races, the fusion of bloods for hundreds of years—due to migration, travel, education and mental unity—has led to there being no really pure racial types today. [...] This is far more certainly the case than the most enlightened <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> long, long history of mankind is considered. [...] Sexual intercourse knows no impenetrable barriers, and people today have in them all the strains and the blood of all the races, and this (as {{a result of the}} world war, 1914-1945) will be increasingly the case. [...] This development is definitely a part of the divine plan, no matter how undesirable it may appear to those who idealize purity of relationship ... Something intended is being brought about and it cannot be avoided." ...|$|E

Dear Miss Charlecote, don't you <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> worst had been the marriage, you would have tried {{everything}} to comfort him? but now that there is this other horrid thing, this presuming on your kindness, it seems to me as if you could not bear to see him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{they might}} not, were it stated in just these terms; yet I <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{question}} of {{the establishment of an}} order of aristocracy among us were put to vote, we should find more women than men who would go for it; and they would flout at the consequences to society with the lively wit and the musical laugh which make feminine selfishness so genteel and agreeable.|$|E

I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Parliament {{settle the}} tax on the county for eight years at 30,000 pounds per annum, no man need ask how it shall be raised [...] . It will be easy enough to raise the money; and no parish can grudge to pay a little larger rate for such a term, on {{condition}} never to be taxed for the highways any more.|$|E

60|$|They {{all started}} telling 'im at once, and I should <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> potman showed him 'is ear once he {{showed it to}} 'im twenty times.
