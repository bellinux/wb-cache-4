5|$|About {{ten o'clock}} last night four {{companies}} of picked men moved over the Long Bridge, as an advance guard.

6000|$|Montesinos.--The British {{ministers who}} began and {{conducted}} {{the first war}} against revolutionary France, were once reminded, in a memorable speech, {{that if they had}} known, or knowing had borne in mind, three maxims of Machiavelli, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> committed the errors which cost this country so dearly. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> relied upon bringing the war to a successful end by aid of a party among the French: <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> confided in the reports of emigrants; and <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> supposed that because the French finances were in confusion, France was therefore incapable of carrying on war with vigour and ability; men and not money being the sinews of war, as Machiavelli had taught, and the revolutionary rulers and Buonaparte after them had learnt. Each of these errors they committed, though all were marked upon the chart! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> {{a servant}} {{to live in}} the house, only a woman who could go home at night. And <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not even <b>have</b> the woman yet. They wanted to do as they liked in their own home, with no {{stranger}} in the midst.|$|R
5|$|Eventually, Hurcomb {{put forward}} at a ministerial meeting a {{solution}} whereby {{the members of}} the inquiry would inform NESCo that on purely technical grounds <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> approved the scheme, but due to the opposition of Morrison, they had decided not to proceed to a decision. Although NESCo were initially hostile, in June 1945 they agreed to drop the scheme on condition that they received a letter from Morrison agreeing that they had satisfied the commissioners on technical grounds, thus entitling them to compenstation. The Government thought the site was open to well founded objections, and even if the scheme had proceeded past the inquiry stage, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> refused consent anyway.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} have {{a relatively}} thin layer of blubber. Blubber can help with buoyancy, protection from predators (<b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{a hard time getting}} through a thick layer of fat), energy for leaner times, and insulation from harsh climates. The habitats of river dolphins lack these needs.|$|E
5|$|The Montana {{class would}} have used {{aircraft}} for reconnaissance and for gunnery spotting. The type of aircraft used would have depended on when exactly the battleships would have been commissioned, but in all probability <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> used either the Kingfisher or the Seahawk. The aircraft would have been floatplanes launched from catapults on the ship's fantail. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> landed {{on the water and}} taxied to the stern of the ship to be lifted by a crane back to the catapult.|$|E

60|$|Swinton and his friends, therefore, had {{recourse}} to secret plotting; but, plot as <b>they</b> <b>would,</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> not sufficient brain-power among them {{to devise a}} method by which to free themselves of the men they envied.|$|R

5|$|Travel in the Toposa {{country was}} {{dangerous}} without a large armed escort, {{and if the}} Ethiopians had got word of the survey <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> tried to occupy {{that part of the}} country.|$|E
5|$|While Sims had a first {{marriage}} which produced his first child Diane Sims, he later married his second wife, Solange. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> 1 son together, Howard Sims Jr., {{as well as}} 5 grandchildren and 1 great-grandchild.|$|E
5|$|A third {{theme of}} the work is the stress on the {{importance}} and number of distinguished burials that took place at Ely. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> increased the desire of others to be buried there, which would have benefited the community by the donations that would have flowed from those wishing to secure their burial. The Liber stresses the burials of Æthelstan, a Bishop of Elmham, that of Ælfwine, another Bishop of Elmham, and Wulfstan II, an Archbishop of York.|$|E
50|$|Before departing Waterland, teams <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to {{get into}} a {{whitewater}} raft and ride it down a series of heavy rapids. During the wild ride, they had to throw balls so that they landed in nearby baskets. If they could get at least three balls into baskets before they {{reached the end of the}} rapids, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> get their next clue. After their second failed attempt, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> only <b>have</b> to get two balls into baskets, and after four failed attempts <b>they</b> <b>would</b> only <b>have</b> to get one in.|$|R

5|$|According to O'Brien, only he, Woodfull, the masseur (who was deaf), Alan Kippax, {{and former}} Australian Test players Jack Ryder and Ernie Jones were present when the {{incident}} took place, {{but most of}} the Australian team were watching the match from a balcony adjoining the dressing room from where <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been able to hear the confrontation. O'Brien claimed that he went outside and told the group what had happened; around twenty people were present.|$|E
5|$|Altar Q and Altar R are {{two small}} {{rhyolite}} disks that probably served as ballcourt markers for the earliest ballcourt, the buried Structure 1B-sub.4. Together {{with a third}} stone <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> marked the central axis of the ballcourt. They both bear seated cross-legged figures carved in shallow relief.|$|E
5|$|Batygin and Brown also {{predict a}} yet-to-be-discovered {{population}} of distant objects. These objects would have semi-major axes greater than , but <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> lower eccentricities and orbits {{that would be}} aligned with that of Planet Nine. The larger perihelia of these objects would make them fainter {{and more difficult to}} detect than the anti-aligned objects.|$|E

5|$|Brown's {{views on}} the 2011 budget cuts and his departures from GOP {{consensus}} placed him at odds {{with some of his}} fellow Republicans and prominent Tea Party conservatives, including Glenn Beck. He said he opposed these measures because he believed that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a negative impact on low income families and children.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff Blues {{had been}} the only team to finish the pool stage of the Heineken Cup unbeaten during the 2008–09 season, which saw them given top seeding for the quarter-finals. This meant that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a home quarter-final against the second-best runners-up from the pool stage, Toulouse. Cardiff won the quarter-final 9–6.|$|E
5|$|Chaffee and Grissom {{were buried}} in Section 3 of Arlington National Cemetery, while White was buried at West Point Cemetery. Chaffee's widow {{received}} $100,000 {{as a part of}} the contract the astronauts signed with two publishing firms so <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> exclusive rights to stories and photographs of the astronauts and their families. She also received $16,250 per year for the life of the contract.|$|E

5|$|Classical Athenian girls {{probably}} reached menarche {{at about}} age fourteen, when <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> married. Girls who died before marriage were mourned for {{their failure to}} reach maturity. Memorial vases for dead girls in classical Athens often portrayed them dressed as brides, and were sometimes shaped like loutrophoroi (vases which held water used to bathe before the wedding day).|$|E
5|$|During the 2nd century, {{at least}} part of the Legio XX Valeria Victrix took part in the {{construction}} of Hadrian's Wall, leading to some sections of the fortress being abandoned and others being allowed to fall into disrepair. The Legio XX Valeria Victrix probably went on campaign in 196 under Decimus Clodius Albinus into Gaul, leaving Deva under-garrisoned. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> suffered heavy losses in Gaul before returning to Britain.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2010, the {{television}} production company Wall to Wall filmed a series for BBC One in the town centre which was broadcast from 2 November 2010. Called Turn Back Time – The High Street, the series features a number of families running traditional bakers, butchers, grocers, and dressmakers shops, {{as well as a}} tea room, as <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been during the Victorian and Edwardian eras, during World War II, and in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
