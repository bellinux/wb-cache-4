40|$|Ethical {{concerns}} {{are inherent in}} the identification of <b>threats,</b> <b>management</b> of responses, and the maintenance of national and individual well-being. Defence, strategic and security policies have historically been merged in the context of Cold War rivalry and the prominence of traditional threats of invasion and war. A twenty-first century security policy addresses a much wider array of threats and challenges, and thus security policy is confronted with a wider array of ethical and normative concerns. A reexamination of precisely how security and ethics are and have been linked in a changing international context is an important starting point for analysis. Here it is argued that the Cold War complex of security practices and principles had particular implications for the kinds of ethical dilemmas which emerged, and that a decline in this complex leads to a reformulation of these ethical dilemmas and the emergence of new, more complex ones...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} will aim {{to discuss}} threats to, {{and consequences of}} current tourism growth and development and emerging issues associated with risk, natural hazards and resilience measures {{that are related to}} current estimations of climate change impact. The Mediterranean and Malta are used as a specific case. The validity and practicality of management options to tackle the complex nature and juxtaposition between tourism, climate change and Mediterranean tourism growth are considered. This includes an evaluation of current <b>threats,</b> <b>management</b> issues and consequent policy choices. The paper proposes that public perception and policy implementation often ignore climate change warnings resulting in inadequate or inappropriate management responses. In conclusion integrated sustainable management strategies are considered and advocated for managing tourism destinations and the associated threats from climate change. Recommendations are considered which aim to ameliorate projected impacts on the tourism industries within the Mediterranean and Malta with more broad implications implied for Mediterranean tourism and further afield tourist destinations globally.

40|$|Woodlands {{represent}} refugia {{for wildlife}} within the intensive agricultural landscape of rural Britain {{but over the}} last century these ecosystems have become highly fragmented, exposing woodland specialist species to a range of <b>threats.</b> <b>Management</b> for pheasant shooting affects 14 % of all woodland area in Britain and is often promoted as a way to reconcile sporting interests with conservation. However, the implications of pheasant release and the associated management for ecosystems are not well understood. I examined this issue by quantifying the effects of pheasant release and the associated management on the abundance and diversity of small mammal and breeding bird populations within game-managed woodlands. I found no evidence to suggest that pheasants impacted woodland ecosystems directly. However, the management practices associated with pheasant release did affect native vertebrates. In autumn, wood mice were more abundant near pheasant release pens, perhaps in response to increased resource levels and/or release from predation pressure within the pen. Common shrews decreased near release pens in autumn, potentially as a result of habitat disturbance. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
