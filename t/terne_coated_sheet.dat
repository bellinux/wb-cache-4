A scanning electron microscopy analysis indicates that micromachining and plastic deformation are the dominant cutting phenomena in sheet steel processing.

40|$|Advanced high {{strength}} steels (AHSS) are being increasingly incorporated into automotive body structure to reduce vehicular weight without adversely affecting crashworthiness. Ultra-{{high strength}} steel (UHSS), a sub-set of AHSS, possess excellent anti-intrusion properties which make them very suitable for fabricating crash relevant automotive structures. The steel is usually coated {{as a necessary}} preparation for further processing. During resistance spot welding, the principal joining method for body-in-white automotive structures, the contact resistance, which is principally determined by {{the properties of the}} coating, play key role in defining welding parameters, thermal profiles, microstructure and eventually, sometimes, mechanical properties of the joint. 	In this work, the contact resistance associated with AlSi and galvannealed coatings on Usibor 1500 hot stamping steel were determined using their dynamic resistance profiles. The results showed significant differences in the contact resistance values associated with the different coatings, and the trend in these values represented trends in current requirements for attaining acceptable nuggets sizes during resistance spot welding. Although peak load for tensile shear loading in static mode was similar for the AlSi and galvannealed <b>coated</b> <b>sheets,</b> there were significant differences in failure mode transition characteristics and energy absorption capabilities associated with the different coatings.

40|$|Polymer <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> metal {{components}} find diverse applications in many industries. The manufacturing {{of the components}} generally involves forming of sheet metal into the desired shape and coating of the formed part with organic coating. An alternative manufacturing route is to <b>coat</b> the <b>sheet</b> metal first before forming. The change in the manufacturing sequence can potentially improve cost and reduce environmental impact. This approach, however, requires the coating to survive the deformation process. Thus, the effect of plastic deformation on coating adhesion is of primary interest to many engineers and researchers. This research aims at developing a methodology to predict the adhesion of coating after metal forming processes. A pull-off apparatus that measures the coating pull-off stress was used to indicate the coating adhesion strength. Several types of specimen were designed to obtain uniaxial tension, biaxial tension, and tension-compression deformation modes on pre-coated sheet by using a uniaxial tensile tester. Experimental results from two selected polymer <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> metals show that coating adhesion was affected by plastic deformation. An analytical model based on a virtual interface crack concept was developed to indicate the adhesion potential of the coating-substrate interface. From interfacial fracture mechanics, the initial adhesion potential {{is defined as the}} energy release rate characterized by the virtual interface crack and the initial pull-off stress. The analytical model was used to predict coating adhesion loss after deformation in uniaxial tension mode. The analytical model predictions agreed well with experimental results. Finite element analysis tool was applied to simulate more complex deformation modes in stamping of <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> meals. The stress field near the interface crack tip was used to calculate the energy release rate and predict the adhesion loss under different deformation modes. The predictions obtained from numerical method are also in good agreements with the experimental results in biaxial tension and tension-compression modes. The research has led {{to a better understanding of}} the effects of plastic deformation on coating adhesion. The developed adhesion test methods can be used to generate useful information on coating durability for diverse practical use. It is also expected that the results of the research will facilitate the development of better polymer <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> metal to be used in sheet metal forming processes...|$|R

The <b>coated</b> <b>sheets</b> presented a more irregular surface than uncoated samples, which {{was associated with}} the chitosan reticulation. The chitosan coating reduced the water solubility and the water vapor permeability of the sheets due to being less hygroscopic. <b>Coated</b> <b>sheets</b> were more rigid and had higher tensile strength than uncoated sheets, because the cross-linking joins the macromolecules covalently, reducing the mobility of the chains. Higher glycerol concentration in the TPS increased the elongation at break due to the glycerol plasticizing effect.

This fact evidences {{the importance of this}} welding process control, due to its efficiency, productivity speediness and straightforward simple automation. This work aimed to study the weldability of zinc coated and uncoated steel sheets for automotive industry, comparing the performance of two welding equipments with two current outputkinds: alternating current (AC) and medium frequency direct current (DC). The welding parameters were kept constant: 260 kgf (force), 150 ms (time) and 7. 0 kA (welding current), based upon an optimization parameters methodology. The joints were characterized using optical metallography (spot diameter, indentation depth and weld penetration depth), mechanical tensile-shear tests and electrical measurements: contact electrical resistance, dynamic resistance and dynamic energy. The results showed that welding in medium frequency direct current was more efficient in generating heat in zinc <b>coated</b> <b>sheets</b> and uncoated sheets than alternating current equipment. In welding using AC and DC equipments in zinc <b>coated</b> <b>sheets,</b> the spot weld time formation was 25 ms longer than uncoated steel sheets spot weld time. The burn of zinc during welding did not damage the spot weld formation with AC or DC equipments. The electrical contact resistance increased with the roughnessand also presented 52 % higher in uncoated sheets than in zinc <b>coated</b> <b>sheets.</b> Finally, the increase in dynamicresistance and dynamic energy augmented the spot weld diameter for both welding equipments.

The effects on coated paper quality from the impingement drying conditions used at both base paper and coated paper drying stages were studied {{for the light}} weight coated (LWC) paper. A central feature {{of the study was}} the development of the capability to dry coated paper by impingement in superheated steam. The variables investigated were the drying fluid, air or superheated steam, drying fluid temperature, drying time and temperature, and coating-to-drying delay time. The effects of drying on the uncoated paper physical properties and the coated paper physical and printing properties were determined. The drying of the base paper with superheated steam gave higher strength and hydrophobicity but lower optical properties and smoothness than drying in air. When steam-dried base paper was coated and dried in air or steam it gave a rougher, less glossy, less bright coated paper than air-dried base paper. Print mottle remained high when air drying was used subsequently for the <b>coated</b> <b>sheet.</b> The biggest effect on LWC coated paper quality derived from the choice of drying medium, air or superheated steam. Coating-to-drying delay time had no effect. Most of the properties of steam-dried coated paper were fixed by 0. 6 s drying time. Properties the most affected were surface properties: print quality, gloss and roughness, while bulk properties were less sensitive.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} core loss of {{electrical}} steel the vacuum arc ion plating technique {{has been used}} to deposit titanium nitride (TiN) layers on highly grain oriented electrical steel sheets. The layer thickness, the stresses of layers and <b>coated</b> <b>sheets</b> and the achieved reduction in core losses have been measured as functions of coating duration and applied bias voltage. Well adhered layers with high compressive stress up to 6. 8 GPa have been produced. With increasing bias voltage the layer thickness decreases and the intrinsic stress of the layers increase. A further increase of bias voltage leads to a drop in stress due to thermal relaxation.
