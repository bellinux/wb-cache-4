5|$|During 1934 {{and early}} 1935, all feature films {{released}} in the Dutch East Indies had been produced by The Teng Chun, based on Chinese mythology or martial arts, and targeted at low-class audiences, generally ethnic Chinese. This situation {{was created by the}} Great Depression, which had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes, advertisers asking for more money, and cinemas selling <b>tickets</b> <b>at</b> lower prices; this ensured that there was a very low profit margin for local films. During this period cinemas in the country mainly showed Hollywood productions.|$|E

5|$|The U2 360° Tour was the highest-grossing tour of 2009, with {{earnings}} of over $311million for the year's 44 shows, and around 3million ticket sales. Due {{to the high}} costs to operate the tour, U2's profits were minimal. Sales of No Line on the Horizon had been slow, meaning the group was not making much money from that either. Through November 2010, the tour's first 66 shows had grossed $443million and sold 4.3million <b>tickets.</b> <b>At</b> the 2010 Billboard Touring Awards, U2 were honored for the year's Top Tour and Top Draw for U2 360°.|$|E

Skinner agrees, so Alex and Lisa, {{accompanied}} by Sherri, Terri, Janey and Allison visit the mall to purchase party supplies, but the girls detour and begin trying on outfits for the dance, despite Lisa's protests. The group leave the mall, none speaking to each other. Lisa decides not to attend the dance, but changes her mind {{and goes to the}} school to take <b>tickets</b> <b>at</b> the door, but later arrives and discovers the boys and girls are standing on different sides of the room, and explains to Alex that it is like this because they are only children, not adults.|$|E

5|$|Minardi boss Paul Stoddart said {{immediately}} after the race that nine teams– all but Ferrari– agreed not to race, and had Jordan not reversed its decision at the last minute, Minardi would also have boycotted the race. In his later, lengthier, statement, he indicated that although it had been Michelin's failure to provide a reliable tyre which had initiated the events, he laid the full blame for the failure to reach some accommodation (which would have allowed a race to happen, {{for the benefit of}} the many fans who had paid considerable money for travel and <b>tickets)</b> <b>at</b> the feet of Max Mosley and the FIA, with a small share of the blame going to what he characterized as the obstructionist Ferrari team leader, Jean Todt. He furthermore called for Mosley's resignation.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the railways in the mid-19th century made the Lake District, and Keswick in particular, more accessible to visitors of modest means. The original impetus for building the Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway (CKP) line came from heavy industry: the new Bessemer process of steelmaking brought a great demand for the rich iron ore from west Cumberland and the coking coal from Durham {{on the east side}} of the country. The CKP was built to enable ore and coal to be brought together at steel foundries in both counties. The line opened for goods traffic in 1864, and the following year it began to carry passengers. Fares varied, but holidaymakers could buy excursion <b>tickets</b> <b>at</b> discounted prices, such as six shillings for the 170-mile return journey from Preston to Keswick.|$|E

5|$|The {{residency}} received positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Reviewers {{were impressed by}} Gaga's vocals, the choreography, and the overall presentation of the residency. The shows were sold out with ticket prices being above the average costs of <b>tickets</b> <b>at</b> the venue. Billboard revealed that the seven dates had sold a total of 24,532 tickets while grossing a total of $1.5 million. Two performances from the residency were transmitted on the Late Show with David Letterman, while MTV and Logo TV collaborated to show the behind-the-scenes logistics for the residency. The final show on April 7, 2014 was live-streamed by Verizon Communications.|$|E
5|$|The {{tour was}} {{produced}} by Live Nation, and promoted by Absolut Vodka in the United States and O2 in the United Kingdom. Tickets for several shows sold out immediately once available, prompting additional dates. Negative reports about the tour's commercial performance were dismissed by Live Nation chairman Arthur Fogel. Gaga repeatedly placed within the top-ten of the Billboard Boxscore lists for the 2014 tour grosses. At the end, ArtRave: The Artpop Ball grossed a total of $83 million from 920,088 sold <b>tickets</b> <b>at</b> the 74 reported performances. Billboard also listed it as the ninth best concert tour of the year with 76 reported shows. The tour additionally received positive response from reviewers, but some criticized it for being disjointed. On November 24, 2014, the concert was streamed live from Bercy Arena in France.|$|E
5|$|Tickets officially {{went on sale}} December 4, {{and three}} days later, Virginia Tech had sold out its entire initial {{allotment}} of 15,000 tickets. A second allotment of 2,400 tickets was sold out in a few hours, leaving ticketless fans disgruntled. Many fans who were turned away at the Virginia Tech ticket office bought tickets from the secondary market or traveled to New Orleans in hopes of buying <b>tickets</b> <b>at</b> the game. So many Virginia Tech fans traveled to the game that the Montgomery County school district extended its winter break one day to avoid a shortage of teachers and students. The crowds also caused problems at Roanoke Regional Airport, the nearest airport to Virginia Tech. Forty-three aircraft chartered by Virginia Tech fans arrived in New Orleans on a single day.|$|E

5|$|During 1934 {{and early}} 1935, all feature films {{released}} in the Dutch East Indies {{had been made by}} the American-educated Chinese-Indonesian director The Teng Chun. His low budget but popular films were mainly inspired by Chinese mythology or martial arts, and although aimed at ethnic Chinese proved popular among native audiences because of their action sequences. The Teng Chun's dominance was an effect of the Great Depression and changing market trends. The Great Depression had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes and cinemas selling <b>tickets</b> <b>at</b> lower prices, ensuring that there was a very low profit margin for local films. As a result, cinemas in the colony mainly showed Hollywood productions, while the domestic industry decayed. The Teng Chun was able to continue his work only because his films often played to full theatres.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014, Billboard {{released}} the first boxscore {{figures for the}} tour, up to the June 2 date.

Final boxscores were released in December 2014, with the last performance at Paris' Palais Omnisports Bercy grossing $1.2 million and audience of 13,013. In total, ArtRave: The Artpop Ball grossed $83 million from 920,088 sold <b>tickets</b> <b>at</b> the 74 reported performances to Billboard Boxscore. On Pollstars Year-end Top 20 Worldwide Tours list, Gaga ranked at number seven with $88.7 million in gross and 947,852 tickets sold for 84 shows, including the seven shows from Roseland Ballroom. Billboard listed it as the ninth best concert tour of the year with 76 reported shows.|$|E
5|$|The 'Best' and 'Back' {{service was}} highly criticized by analysts and customers. Braathens SAFE {{had a strong}} image, and unlike SAS, that was branded as 'The Businessman's Airline', Braathens SAFE {{was seen as the}} people's airline. It also drew {{goodwill}} from being Norwegian-owned, and that it displayed the Flag of Norway on the tailplane. Prior to the rebranding, no airline in Norway had ever operated a two-class service on domestic flights—including SAS. Professor of Sociology Per Morten Schiefloe commented that the introduction of segregation of passengers offended passengers. Customers who previously had been paying full price, became more aware of the savings on using 'Back' <b>tickets.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, people who wanted to travel with discounted tickets felt that they got better service and were not treated as second-rate customers with SAS. This caused Braathens to lose customers at both ends. The rebranding itself not only cost money to initiate, but also increased operating expenses, because cabin crew needed to move the curtain depending on the number of passengers on each class. Planes were sometimes delayed for hours, particularly {{in the beginning of the}} service, due to the increased work load on the handling and cabin crew.|$|E

5|$|The house {{seems to}} have been rebuilt since the time that Sir Samuel Morland dwelt in it. About the year 1730, Mr. Jonathan Tyers became the {{occupier}} of it, and, there being a large garden belonging to it, planted with a great number of stately trees, and laid out in shady walks, it obtained the name of Spring Gardens; and the house being converted into a tavern, or place of entertainment, was much frequented by the votaries of pleasure. Mr. Tyers opened it with an advertisement of a Ridotto al Fresco, a term which {{the people of this country}} had till that time been strangers to. These entertainments were repeated in the course of the summer, and numbers resorted to partake of them. This encouraged the proprietor to make his garden a place of musical entertainment, for every evening during the summer season. To this end he was at great expense in decorating the gardens with paintings; he engaged a band of excellent musicians; he issued silver <b>tickets</b> <b>at</b> one guinea each for admission, and receiving great encouragement, he set up an organ in the orchestra, and, in a conspicuous part of the garden, erected a fine statue of Mr. Handel.|$|E
