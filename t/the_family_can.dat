5|$|Seeds {{and fruit}} form the major {{component}} of the diets of pigeons and doves. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>can</b> be divided into the seed-eating or granivorous species (subfamily Columbinae) and the fruit-and-mast-eating or frugivorous species (the other four subfamilies). The granivorous species typically feed on seed found on the ground, whereas the frugivorous species tend to feed in trees. There are morphological adaptations {{that can be used}} to distinguish between the two groups: granivores tend to have thick walls in their gizzards, intestines, and esophagi whereas the frugivores tend to have thin walls. In addition, fruit-eating species have short intestines whereas those that eat seeds have longer ones. Frugivores are capable of clinging to branches and even hang upside down to reach fruit.|$|E
5|$|Suffering {{withdrawal}} syndrome from {{the lack of}} cable, Peter straps a television-sized cardboard cutout to himself, making it appear as though his whole world is actually a television programme. When Meg can no longer deal with the public scorn, she reveals that her father is really responsible for Quahog's loss of television, causing the town to turn against him. In an attempt to save Peter from further scorn and verbal attacks, Lois gives a heartfelt speech to the community about how television has kept them all from enjoying one another. Inspired by the speech, Peter drags the family to one outdoor activity after another, which quickly exhausts them. Once <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>can</b> no longer keep up with him, Peter decides to go off with William Shatner, who has appeared on the Griffin family doorstep after experiencing a flat tire, to a nearby festival. Meanwhile, Stewie's weather machine creates a huge rainstorm. The storm's lightning strike destroys Stewie's weather machine and blows Stewie off the roof and on the ground. While Meg is practicing driving with Lois, the storm causes her to accidentally hit Shatner and Peter, killing Shatner and hospitalizing Peter. As her father recovers, in a full-body cast, he is forced to watch television, causing him to become addicted once again, much to his family's relief.|$|E

25|$|The {{surgical}} process {{depends upon}} which organs are being donated. After the surgeons remove the organs, they are transported {{as quickly as}} possible to the recipient, for immediate transplantation. Most organs only survive outside the body for a few hours, so recipients in the same region are usually chosen. In the case of a dead donor, after the organs are removed, the body is normally restored to as normal an appearance as possible, so that <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>can</b> proceed with funeral rites and either cremation or burial.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>can</b> {{be traced back}} to the Ruspoli of Florence in the 13th century and through the family's claimed direct descent from Marius Scotus in the 8th century and the Marescottis of Bologna. In the 17th century the Ruspolis moved to Rome where the last {{descendant}}, Vittoria Ruspoli, Marchioness of Cerveteri, married Sforza Vicino Marescotti Count of Vignanello, a descendant of the Farnese family on both his mother's and father's side. One of Vittoria's sons took the Ruspoli name and coat of arms to guarantee the continuity of the house.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{families}} of graphs may, however, {{have much more}} restrictive bounds on the numbers of maximal independent sets or maximal cliques. If all n-vertex graphs {{in a family of}} graphs have O(n) edges, and if every subgraph of a graph in the family also belongs to the family, then each graph in <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>can</b> have at most O(n) maximal cliques, all of which have size O(1). For instance, these conditions are true for the planar graphs: every n-vertex planar graph has at most 3n6 edges, and a subgraph of a planar graph is always planar, from which it follows that each planar graph has O(n) maximal cliques (of size at most four). Interval graphs and chordal graphs also have at most n maximal cliques, even though they are not always sparse graphs.|$|E

25|$|Balinese Hindu {{dead are}} {{generally}} buried inside the container {{for a period}} of time, which may exceed one month or more, so that the cremation ceremony (Ngaben) can occur on an auspicious day in the Balinese-Javanese Calendar system ("Saka"). Additionally, if the departed was a court servant, member of the court or minor noble, the cremation can be postponed up to several years to coincide with the cremation of their Prince. Balinese funerals are very expensive and the body may be interred until <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>can</b> afford it or until there is a group funeral planned by the village or family when costs will be less. The purpose of burying the corpse is for the decay process to consume the fluids of the corpse, which allows for an easier, more rapid and more complete cremation.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some {{individuals}} may actually {{find it easier}} to escape situations of abuse in the United States than they would have in their countries of origin. Among some immigrants there is much criticism {{of the way in which}} women in particular have been changed by American culture. Women may be seen as too Americanized because of the way they dress or their lack of deference to men. The general support for gender equality within American society can undermine traditional power hierarchies within the family in which men had control over the actions of women. One of the ways that such power is undermined is through the presence of laws against domestic violence. In some patriarchal societies, husbands may have complete control over their wives, including control over their bodies. U.S. laws do not support this sort of arrangement and women who are aware of their rights can utilize formal legal institutions to combat such gender imbalances within the family. The ability of government authorities to intervene in the realm of <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>can</b> undermine the traditional power balance and leave men feeling dispossessed.|$|E
25|$|Arthur's lack of {{employment}} becomes {{a huge problem}} for him in 1986 when his daughter, Michelle, announces her engagement to Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt). Desperate to give his daughter a wedding that <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>can</b> be proud of, Arthur decides to take money from the Walford residents' Christmas Club savings scheme {{that he has been}} running. However, with Christmas fast approaching, Arthur realises that he will have to do something to explain the lack of money in the account to everyone that contributed. Arthur announces to the members that he has withdrawn the money, then stages a fake burglary at his house and tells the police that the Christmas Club money has been stolen. However, Arthur's attempts to make the robbery look legitimate fail, and the police soon realise that Arthur is the culprit. When questioned by the police, he confesses and after his arrest he becomes severely morose, withdrawn and depressed. This culminates in Arthur finally having a nervous breakdown on Christmas Day and smashing his living room in a violent rage. By early 1987, Arthur has become so despondent that he is admitted to hospital. He returns the following spring to stand trial for the theft of the Christmas Club money. Despite Arthur having the whole community behind him, he is sent to prison for 28 days. After his release, he makes things worse by borrowing money from a loan shark.|$|E

25|$|Separators {{have been}} used as part of data {{compression}} algorithms for representing planar graphs and other separable graphs using a small number of bits. The basic principle of these algorithms is to choose a number k and repeatedly subdivide the given planar graph using separators into O(n/k) subgraphs of size at most k, with O(n/√k) vertices in the separators. With an appropriate choice of k (at most proportional to the logarithm of n) the number of non-isomorphic k-vertex planar subgraphs is significantly less than the number of subgraphs in the decomposition, so the graph can be compressed by constructing a table of all the possible non-isomorphic subgraphs and representing each subgraph in the separator decomposition by its index into the table. The remainder of the graph, formed by the separator vertices, may be represented explicitly or by using a recursive version of the same data structure. Using this method, planar graphs and many more restricted families of planar graphs may be encoded using a number of bits that is information-theoretically optimal: if there are Pn n-vertex graphs in the family of graphs to be represented, then an individual graph in <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>can</b> be represented using only (1nbsp&+nbsp&o(n))log2Pn bits. It is also possible to construct representations of this type in which one may test adjacency between vertices, determine the degree of a vertex, and list neighbors of vertices in constant time per query, by augmenting the table of subgraphs with additional tabular information representing the answers to the queries.|$|E
