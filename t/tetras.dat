25|$|Characiformes is {{an order}} of ray-finned fish, {{comprising}} the characins and their allies. Grouped in 18 recognized families, {{there are more than}} two thousand different species, including the well-known piranha and <b>tetras.</b>|$|E
25|$|A few {{characins}} {{become quite}} large, and are important as food or game. Most, however, are small shoaling fish. Many species known as <b>tetras</b> are popular in aquaria {{thanks to their}} bright colors, general hardiness, and tolerance towards other fish in community tanks.|$|E
25|$|One {{variable}} is differences between fish. Smaller fish consume more oxygen per gram {{of body weight}} than larger fish. Labyrinth fish can breathe atmospheric oxygen and do not need as much surface area (however, some of these fish are territorial, and do not appreciate crowding). Barbs also require more surface area than <b>tetras</b> of comparable size.|$|E

25|$|The non-cichlid native fish include African <b>tetras</b> (Brycinus), {{cyprinids}} (Enteromius, Garra, Labeo, Labeobarbus, Rastrineobola and Xenobarbus), airbreathing catfish (Clariallabes, Clarias and Xenoclarias), bagrid catfish (Bagrus), loach catfish (Amphilius and Zaireichthys), silver butter catfish (Schilbe intermedius), Synodontis squeaker catfish, Nothobranchius killifish, poeciliids (Aplocheilichthys and Micropanchax), the spiny eel Mastacembelus frenatus, elephantfish (Gnathonemus, Hippopotamyrus, Marcusenius, Mormyrus, Petrocephalus, and Pollimyrus), {{the climbing}} gourami Ctenopoma muriei and marbled lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus).|$|E
25|$|Brazil {{has over}} 3,000 {{identified}} species {{of freshwater fish}} and over 500 species of amphibians. As elsewhere in South America, {{the majority of the}} freshwater fish species are characiforms (<b>tetras</b> and allies) and siluriforms (catfish), but there are also many species from other groups such as the cyprinodontiforms and cichlids. While the majority of Brazil's fish species are native to the Amazon, the Paraná–Paraguay and the São Francisco river basins, the country also has an unusually high number of troglobitic fish, with 25 species (15% of the total in the world) known so far. The most well-known fish in Brazil is the piranha.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1970s and early and mid-1980s {{there were a}} number of {{groundbreaking}} female punk and rock musicians who later influenced the riot grrrl ethos. These included Siouxsie Sioux, Poly Styrene, The Slits, Au Pairs, The Raincoats, Patti Smith, Chrissie Hynde, The Runaways/Joan Jett, The B-52's, LiLiPUT, Lydia Lunch, Exene Cervenka, Kim Gordon, Ut, Neo Boys, Bush <b>Tetras,</b> Y Pants, ESG, Chalk Circle, Fifth Column, Frightwig, X-Ray Spex, Scrawl, and Anti-Scrunti Faction. The 1980s also featured a number of female folk singers from New York whose lyrics were realistic and socio-political, but also personally intimate.|$|E

25|$|But ASR is {{not limited}} to the {{intertidal}} environment. Most tropical and temperate fish species living in stagnant waters engage in ASR during hypoxia. One study looked at 26 species representing eight families of non-air breathing fishes from the North American great plains, and found that all but four of them performed ASR during hypoxia. Another study looked at 24 species of tropical fish common to the pet trade, from <b>tetras</b> to barbs to cichlids, and found that all of them performed ASR. An unusual situation in which ASR is performed is during winter, in lakes covered by ice, at the interface between water and ice or near air bubbles trapped underneath the ice.|$|E
2500|$|New York City had the {{earliest}} documented punk rock {{scene in the}} United States. Drawing on local influences such as The Velvet Underground, Richard Hell, and the New York Dolls, punk music developed at clubs such as CBGB and Max's Kansas City. Patti Smith, Talking Heads, Blondie, Suicide, Television, The Fleshtones, and other artsy new wave artists were popular in the mid-to-late 1970s, as bands like the Ramones were establishing an American punk rock sound. CBGB and Max's Kansas City opened their doors and became influential venues. No Wave was a short-lived movement in New York and raised James Chance, DNA, Rhys Chatham, Glenn Branca, Lydia Lunch, Rat At Rat R, Swans, Bush <b>Tetras,</b> Live Skull, Band of Susans, Ut, and later Sonic Youth.

2500|$|In {{terms of}} aquatic life, the Congo River Basin {{has a very}} high species richness, and among the highest known {{concentrations}} of endemics. Until now, almost 700 fish species have been recorded from the Congo River Basin, and large sections remain virtually unstudied. This {{is by far the}} highest diversity of any African river system (in comparison, the next richest are the Niger, Volta and Nile with about 210, 140 and 130 fish species, respectively). Due to this and the great ecological differences between the regions in the Congo basin, it is often divided into multiple ecoregions (instead of treating it as a single ecoregion). Among these ecoregions, the Lower Congo Rapids alone has more than 300 fish species, including approximately 80 endemics while the southwestern part (Kasai Basin) alone has more than 200 fish species, of which about a quarter are endemic. The dominant fish families – at least in parts of the river – are Cyprinidae (carp/cyprinids, such as Labeo simpsoni), Mormyridae (elephantfishes), Alestidae (African <b>tetras),</b> Mochokidae (squeaker catfishes), and Cichlidae (cichlids). Among the natives in the river is the huge, highly carnivorous giant tigerfish. Three of the more unusual endemics are the whitish (non-pigmented) and blind Lamprologus lethops, which is believed to live as deep as [...] below the surface, Heterochromis multidens, which appears to be more closely related to cichlids of the Americas than other African cichlids, and Caecobarbus geertsii, the only known cavefish in Central Africa. There are also numerous endemic frogs and snails. Several hydroelectric dams are planned on the river, and these may lead to the extinction of many of the endemics.|$|E
50|$|The green neon <b>tetra</b> (P. simulans) {{and black}} neon <b>tetra</b> (Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi) are {{distinct}} species—the latter belongs to an altogether different genus—and not color varieties. The cardinal <b>tetra</b> (P. axelrodi)—also {{sometimes called the}} red neon—is a very similar species, and is often confused with the true neon <b>tetra.</b> In a domestic aquarium, the two species will school together, especially if numbers {{of one of the}} species are insufficient to form a school. The neon <b>tetra</b> will also school with P. simulans if {{there are only a few}} of each. The cardinal <b>tetra's</b> larger size and greater extent of red coloring distinguishes it from the neon <b>tetra.</b> The term Hyphessobrycon innesi is an obsolete synonym for P. innesi, the neon <b>tetra</b> itself.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Tetra</b> Brik {{package was}} {{introduced}} in 1963, after a long process of development and built on the previous <b>Tetra</b> Classic tetrahedron package that {{laid the foundation for}} <b>Tetra</b> Pak. Despite the revolutionary character of the new retail system, {{by the end of the}} 1950s Ruben Rausing and the <b>Tetra</b> Pak management team realised that the <b>Tetra</b> Pak package portfolio needed to be supplemented by an additional rectangular model to continue to be competitive. Large amounts were spent on development and in 1963 the first <b>Tetra</b> Brik packaging machine was installed in Motala in central Sweden. Due to its effective use of space and materials and the increased efficiency in distribution and storage that resulted from the rectangular shape, the <b>Tetra</b> Brik soon became <b>Tetra</b> Pak's best seller in Sweden and internationally and paved the way for <b>Tetra</b> Pak's enormous success during the 1970s and onwards.|$|R
2500|$|Many {{aboveground}} fish {{may enter}} caves on occasion, but obligate cavefish (fish that require underground habitats) are extremophiles {{with a number}} of unusual adaptations known as troglomorphism. In some species, notably the Mexican tetra, shortfin molly, Oman garra, Indoreonectes evezardi and a few catfish, both [...] "normal" [...] aboveground and cavefish forms exist. Many adaptions seen in cavefish are aimed at surviving in a habitat with little food. Living in darkness, pigmentation and eyes are useless, or an actual disadvantage because of their energy requirements, and therefore typically reduced in cavefish. Other examples of adaptations are larger fins for more energy-efficient swimming, and a loss of scales and swim bladder. The loss can be complete or only partial, for example resulting in small or incomplete (but still existing) eyes, and eyes can be present in the earliest life stages but degenerated by the adult stage. In some cases, [...] "blind" [...] cavefish may still be able to see: Juvenile Mexican <b>tetras</b> of the cave form are able to sense light via certain cells in the pineal gland (pineal eye), and Congo blind barbs are photophobic, despite only having retinas and optical nerves that are rudimentary and located deep inside the head, and completely lacking a lens. In the most extreme cases, the lack of light has changed the circadian rhythm (24-hour internal body clock) of the cavefish. In the Mexican tetra of the cave form and in Phreatichthys andruzzii the circadian rhythm lasts 30 hours and 47 hours, respectively. This may help them to save energy. Without sight, other senses are used and these may be enhanced. Examples include the lateral line for sensing vibrations, mouth suction to sense nearby obstacles (comparable to echolocation), and chemoreception (via smell and taste buds). Although there are cavefish in groups known to have electroreception (catfish and South American knifefish), there is no published evidence that this is enhanced in the cave-dwellers. The level of specialized adaptations in a cavefish is generally considered to be directly correlated to the amount of time it has been restricted to the underground habitat, with species that recently arrived showing few adaptations and species with the largest number of adaptations likely being the ones restricted to the habitat for the longest time.|$|E
50|$|Ornate <b>tetras</b> {{are kept}} in the {{aquarium}} hobby. Most individuals in the aquarium trade are bred commercially over collecting them in the wild. They have been sold as bentos <b>tetras,</b> white tip <b>tetras,</b> or false rosy <b>tetras</b> in certain stores.|$|E
50|$|Silvertip tetra (Hasemania nana) are {{freshwater}} tetra fish {{native to}} blackwater rivers in Brazil. Silvertip <b>tetras</b> are slightly {{more aggressive than}} other comparable smaller <b>tetras,</b> observed occasionally to nip other similarly sized <b>tetras.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The dawn <b>tetra,</b> panda <b>tetra,</b> or Rio Paraguay <b>tetra</b> (Aphyocharax paraguayensis) {{comes from}} the Rio Paraguay basin in Paraguay and Brazil.

It will eat normal aquarium fish food, but much prefers live food. The dawn <b>tetra</b> is an egg-scattering species. [...] This <b>tetra</b> is very active and extremely aggressive towards fish of similar or smaller size or those that are slower moving. Not suitable for the community tank.|$|R

50|$|Like {{the other}} Paracheirodon species, the green neon <b>tetra</b> is kept as an {{aquarium}} fish, {{but it is}} less commonly seen than either the neon <b>tetra</b> or the cardinal <b>tetra.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Because of the {{popularity}} of <b>tetras</b> in the fishkeeping hobby, many unrelated fish {{are commonly known as}} <b>tetras,</b> including species from different families. Even vastly different fish may be called <b>tetras.</b> For example, payara (Hydrolycus scomberoides) is occasionally known as the [...] "sabretooth tetra" [...] or [...] "vampire tetra".|$|E
50|$|Bloodfin <b>tetras</b> are {{typically}} kept in schools {{of five or}} more. They swim mainly in the upper and middle water layers and are highly sociable fishes, mixing well {{with other types of}} <b>tetras</b> and tropical fish in general, so are often kept (like many other <b>tetras)</b> in a community tank. However, they will tend to nip at the fins of fish with long, wavy fins, such as angelfish or guppies. Bloodfin <b>tetras</b> have also been kept in cold-water tanks, provided the temperature does not drop below room temperature. They have been kept in temperatures ranging from 64-83°F. <b>Tetras</b> are adapted to soft, slightly acidic water, and soft water is essential for breeding. Bloodfin <b>tetras</b> can adapt to many water conditions in captivity, if the tap water is dechlorinated.|$|E

50|$|In an {{interview}} in Swedish business monthly Affärsvärlden in 2006, <b>Tetra</b> Pak CEO Dennis Jönsson defined <b>Tetra</b> Pak's current main competitor to be Swiss manufacturer SIG Combibloc, however adding that <b>Tetra</b> Pak's main competition generally no longer comes from companies producing similar packaging but from industries and companies producing other types of packaging with a lower cost of production, like the PET bottle. Indeed, Jönsson perceived the PET bottle as <b>Tetra</b> Pak's biggest threat in the European market at the time. The Norwegian company Elopak/Pure-Pak produces similar style carton packages and has historically been <b>Tetra</b> Pak's principal competitor. The Chinese packaging company Greatview has begun challenging <b>Tetra</b> Pak, both in the Chinese market {{as well as in}} Europe.

5000|$|<b>Tetra</b> Pak {{operates}} globally through 40 market companies, {{which are}} subsidiaries to <b>Tetra</b> Pak International SA, {{doing business in}} over 170 countries. Because of the low relative cost of its end products, the developing world {{has been an important}} market for <b>Tetra</b> Pak from the start. In 2010, <b>Tetra</b> Pak reported a 5.2% increase in sales, with an annual turnover of almost €10 billion. In its 2010/2011 annual report, <b>Tetra</b> Pak announced particularly strong growth in China, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Central and South America. Rising income levels in these markets enabled higher consumption of protein-rich foodstuffs such as dairy products, and <b>Tetra</b> Pak has announced that it will increase investment in the emerging markets by 10% to over €200 million (2009). After investing close to €200 million in new packaging plants in Russia (2007) and China (2008), in 2011 <b>Tetra</b> Pak announced the construction of new packaging plants in India and Pakistan to meet increasing demand. The new plants on the Indian sub-continent are thought to supply the growing demand in the Middle East. The Financial Times reported that the rise in milk consumption in emerging markets particularly regarded UHT milk, facilitating transportation and food safety, something which is favourable for <b>Tetra</b> Pak whose aseptic packages represent two-thirds of its sales. <b>Tetra</b> Pak's most popular product is the <b>Tetra</b> Brik Aseptic, a best-seller since the 1970s.

50|$|In 1981, <b>Tetra</b> Pak {{relocated}} {{its corporate}} headquarters to Lausanne, Switzerland, for tax reasons, however retaining all R&D functions in Lund, Sweden. For {{the equivalent of}} $2.5 billion, <b>Tetra</b> Pak acquired Alfa-Laval AB in 1991, a venerable Swedish company producing industrial and agricultural equipment and milk separators, world-leading in its industry, in what {{was at the time}} Sweden's largest takeover. Since the deal allowed <b>Tetra</b> Pak to integrate the Alfa Laval competence within processing, the merger eventually made it possible for <b>Tetra</b> Pak to offer entire packaging and processing products to its clients. The deal drew anti-competitive scrutiny from the European Commission, but it went through after various concessions from both companies. After the merger with Alfa Laval, <b>Tetra</b> Pak announced plans to return the headquarters to Sweden, and in 1993 <b>Tetra</b> Laval Group was created with joint headquarters in Lund and Lausanne. Alfa Laval's liquid processing unit was absorbed into <b>Tetra</b> Pak and the unit specialising on machinery for dairy production was organised separately in Alfa Laval Agri. Alfa Laval Agri was later renamed DeLaval, after Alfa Laval's founder Gustaf de Laval, and is still a part of the <b>Tetra</b> Laval group. The part of Alfa Laval that was not directly linked to <b>Tetra</b> Pak's activities - heat exchangers and separation equipment among others - was sold in 2000 to Swedish finance group Industri Kapital. In 2001, <b>Tetra</b> Laval acquired the French plastic packaging group Sidel. The merger was prohibited by the European Commission on the grounds that both <b>Tetra</b> Pak and Sidel were market leading in their field and operated in related business areas. The European Court of Justice eventually ruled in favour for <b>Tetra</b> Laval in a high-profile case.
