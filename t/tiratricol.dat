50|$|<b>Tiratricol</b> {{has also}} been widely marketed, under various trade names, as a weight loss aid. In 1999 and 2000, the United States Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada both issued {{warnings}} to the public {{regarding the use of}} dietary supplements containing <b>tiratricol.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Tiratricol</b> is not {{approved}} {{for sale in}} Canada or the United States. It was once an approved drug in Brazil, but its marketing authorization was suspended in 2003, effectively prohibiting its sale. <b>Tiratricol</b> is still available in France for therapy of thyroid hormone resistance and adjuvant therapy of thyroid cancer. It is available as an orphan drug to be prescribed by registered specialists in Europe.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tiratricol</b> (also {{known as}} TRIAC or triiodothyroacetic acid) is a thyroid hormone analogue. Triiodothyroacetic acid {{is also a}} {{physiologic}} thyroid hormone that {{is present in the}} normal organism in low concentrations.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{established}} {{treatment for}} AHDS. Theoretical considerations suggested TRIAC (triiodothyroacetate or <b>tiratricol,</b> a natural non-classical thyroid hormone) to be beneficial. In 2014, a case was demonstrated in which therapy with TRIAC {{in early childhood}} led to significant improvement of cognition and mobility. Currently, the effect of Triac is under investigation.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to evaluate histologically the skin of swines submitted to mesotherapy with <b>tiratricol,</b> caffeine and hyaluronidase. Histological processing was conducted in Hematoxilin and Eosin (HE) of the skin of swines treated being obtained measures of thickness of the hipodermis using a Zeiss ocular micrometer. It was verified that the treatments with <b>tiratricol</b> and caffeine provoked reduction of the thickness of the hipodermis (42. 3 % and 55. 3 %, respectively, p 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{thyroid hormone}} analog with organ-selective effects could have {{therapeutic}} application for {{disorders such as}} hyperlipidemia and osteoporosis. We performed a randomized clinical trial to determine the specific thyromimetic effects of <b>tiratricol.</b> Twenty-four athyreotic patients underwent detailed metabolic and physiological evaluation after a 2 -month baseline period, taking TSH-suppressive doses of L-T 4. They were then randomized to blinded treatment with either <b>tiratricol</b> (24 �g/kg twice daily) or L-T 4 (1. 9 �g/kg daily). The dose of hormone was increased until the TSH level was less than 0. 1 mU/L, and the metabolic and physiological testing was repeated. Comparing the change from baseline to the study drug periods, when serum TSH levels were equivalently suppressed, {{there were no significant}} differences between the two groups in resting metabolic rate, weight, THYROID HORMONES have widespread effects, includin...|$|E
40|$|The {{screening}} of a commercially available library of compounds has proved a successful {{strategy for the}} identification of a lead compound in a drug discovery programme. Here, we analysed 880 off-patent drugs, which initially comprised the Prestwick Chemical library, as sources of bacterial endotoxin neutralizers. We identified 3, 3 ', 5 -triiodo-thyroacetic acid (<b>tiratricol)</b> as a non-antibacterial compound that neutralizes the toxic lipopolysaccharide. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|A simple LC/UV {{method for}} the {{simultaneous}} identification and quantification of Fluoxetine, <b>Tiratricol,</b> Benfluorex and Pseudoephedrine in slimming formulation is proposed. The method demonstrated {{effective in the}} analyses of herbal mixtures marketed in Italy as slimming capsules. Sixteen different herbal mixtures, selected among the most frequently compounded in Italian pharmacies, were tested as matrices. HPLC analyses were performed in a gradient mode on a C 18 stationary phase The method was validated for accuracy, precision, linearity and selectivity. The limits of detection (LOD) were 3. 4 μg/mL for Pseudoephedrine, 1. 1 μg/mL for Triac, 0. 9 μg/mL for Fluoxetine, and 0. 8 μg/mL for Benfluorex. Repeatability and intermediate precision, expressed as percent of relative standard deviation, ranged from 3 to 7 and from 7 to 12, respectively. Given these limits, the developed method is proposed for the simple and cost effective screening of herbal products illegally adulterated with these four drugs known to enhance slimming effects...|$|E
