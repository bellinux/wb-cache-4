40|$|An {{new type}} of {{electric}} field instrumentation was developed for lighting prediction at KSC. Currently, it is being installed at several government laboratories and is being {{made available to the}} public. It has important advantages over the previous method for measuring electric fields with motor driven field mills: (1) it has no moving parts and requires little maintenance compared to rotating machinery; (2) it is unaffected by rain, snow, sand, or insects, all of which can influence field mills; and (3) the lightweight sensor can be mounted easily on a tall mast. By mounting the instrumentation on a tall mast the instrumentation is placed above much of the blanket of point discharge ions that are emitted from objects on the ground during thunderstorms. This space charge limits the ability of any ground based electric field sensor to accurately measure cloud electric fields which produce lightning. The elevated mounting was demonstrated to significantly improve monitoring of thunderstorm electric fields. This instrumentation measures the atmospheric potential relative to earth at a corona needle sensor on top of a mast which normally is mounted on a tower or roof. The needle is kept in corona at all times by a low power high voltage power supply. This produces a small cloud of ions around the needle allowing a current to flow. Measurement of the current provides the atmospheric potential. The potential divided by the height of the needle above the ground is proportional to the average electric field between the needle and earth. The potential on top of a tall pole or above a rooftop is more representative of the intensity of cloud electrification than electric field measurements made at ground level.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe communication industry is clearly {{in a state}} of transition and communication managers faced with decisions about commitments to today's products need to know about possible future changes in the industry. To fulfill this need, this study develops technological forecasts for hard copy and <b>video</b> display communications <b>terminals.</b> Changes in input/output parameters of the terminals, when the changes will occur, and how rapid the changes will be are estimated. These forecasts are determined by first measuring a limited number of performance parameters such as print rate and transmission speed. Then mathematical models are fitted to the performance parameter data and the trend extrapolated into the future to make predictions. The results of the study indicate that print rates will increase significantly in the next ten years to a level of approximately 2000 characters per second and transmission speeds to' a level of approximately 500, 000 bits per second for hard copy <b>terminals.</b> <b>Video</b> display <b>terminals</b> show a steeper increase with transmission speed levels of 1. 5 Mbps predicted in the next five years. Also, the print rate per dollar and transmission speed per dollar for these terminals will show rapid increases in the next ten years.
