5|$|Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson sees Vivienne Michel as {{the best}} {{realised}} female characterisation undertaken by Fleming, partly because <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>told</b> {{in the first person}} narrative. Academic Jeremy Black notes that Michel is the closest Fleming gets to kitchen sink realism in the Bond canon: she has been a victim of life in the past, but is wilful and tough, too.|$|E

5|$|To Kill a Mockingbird is a {{novel by}} Harper Lee {{published}} in 1960. It was immediately successful, winning the Pulitzer Prize, {{and has become a}} classic of modern American literature. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was 10years old. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>told</b> by the six-year-old Jean Louise Finch.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps no {{work of art}} so {{imperfect}} ever announced {{such power}} in the artist—perhaps no artist so powerful ever rested his fame on so imperfect a production—as Thalaba. The author calls it a metrical romance; he might have called it a lyrical one; for <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>told,</b> as in an ode, by implication; not directly, as in an epopoeia. It is a gallery of successive pictures. Each is strikingly descriptive... but the personages, like the figures of landscape-painters, are often almost lost in the scene: they appear as the episodical or accessory objects.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil – Code: Veronica {{features}} traditional survival horror gameplay {{found in}} most early Resident Evil games. This includes the series signature controls, interface, puzzles, as well as zombies and monsters to battle. Unlike previous games in the series which used pre-rendered backgrounds, Code: Veronica uses real-time 3D environments. Because of this, the camera is more dynamic than in previous games. The camera will follow, pan, and zoom as the player navigates their character through the environment, similar to Capcom's own Dino Crisis (1999). <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>told</b> through cinematic CGI sequences and in-game cutscenes.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> in first-person form by Senator Decius Caecilius Metellus the Younger (born c 91-95 BC), {{nephew of}} Metellus Pius {{and member of}} the {{powerful}} Caecilius Metellus family of the Roman Senate. <b>The</b> <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> in flashback-form by the old Decius, writing during the reign of Augustus Caesar. <b>The</b> <b>stories</b> range from 70 BC (The King's Gambit) to 20 BC ("The King of Sacrifices").|$|R
5|$|The Spy Who Loved Me is {{the ninth}} novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series, first {{published}} by Jonathan Cape on 16 April 1962. It {{is the shortest}} and most sexually explicit of Fleming's novels, {{as well as a}} clear departure from previous Bond novels in that <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>told</b> in the first person by a young Canadian woman, Vivienne Michel. Bond himself does not appear until two-thirds of the way through the book. Fleming wrote a prologue to the novel giving Michel credit as a co-author.|$|E
5|$|The {{levels are}} {{displayed}} in an overworld with a branching, tree structure. The player must pursue multiple branches to further the story. Optional, side-story branches do not advance the main plot but have the hardest puzzles. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>told</b> through chains of emails, which are unlocked by completing puzzles. The player assumes {{the role of an}} American Muslim National Security Agency agent who determines whether the hacked emails are pertinent to national security. The ethics of government surveillance are a core theme of the game.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>told</b> in {{the first-person}} through the protagonist, Elspeth Gordie, {{a teenage girl}} who has secret mental powers such as telepathy {{and the ability to}} {{communicate}} with animals. The story begins at Kindraide orphan home, where she and her brother Jes live, before moving briefly through Sutrium, the capital, and the countryside. However the majority of the narrative is set at Obernewtyn, which lies in the northern mountains of the Land, the fictional nation in which the Obernewtyn Chronicles is set.|$|E

5|$|Vampyr was {{challenging}} for Dreyer {{to make as}} {{it was his first}} sound film and had to be recorded in three languages. To overcome this, very little dialogue was used in the film and much of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>told</b> with silent film-styled title cards. The film was shot entirely on location and to enhance the atmospheric content, Dreyer opted for a washed out, soft focus photographic technique. The audio editing was done in Berlin where the character's voices, sound effects, and score were added to the film.|$|E
5|$|After Gasketball 2012 release, Boxleiter and Wohlwend {{planned a}} celebratory road {{trip to a}} game jam in Victoria, British Columbia. The game did not fare as expected, so Boxleiter used the two-day jam to create the core mirror {{reflection}} mechanics of what would become TouchTone, though it would take two years of sporadic work to finalize {{the remainder of the}} game. In TouchTone, the player monitors phone calls as part of a government surveillance program to find public threats. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>told</b> through a series of reflection puzzles wherein the player swipes the screen to reflect a beam around a room to its intended destination.|$|E
5|$|Don't take it {{personally}} is a visual novel, or interactive fiction game {{where the majority of}} <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>told</b> through still images of the speaking characters in front of anime-style backgrounds with text overlaid. The player's viewpoint follows one character, the teacher in a school, with the player seeing his thoughts as well as his and the other characters' statements. The player advances the conversations the teacher is in or witnesses at will, but cannot go backwards and has little control over what any of the characters, including the teacher, are saying except at a few key moments. At these points, the player is presented with two or three choices for what the teacher says; which option is chosen can change what path the plot takes, in either a minor or major way.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy Type-0, {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game developed {{and published by}} Square Enix in 2011, revolves around a war between four {{nations in the world}} of Orience. An episodic companion game, Final Fantasy Agito, was released in 2014. Type-0 was re-released internationally in 2015 as a high-definition remaster for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The main protagonists are Class Zero, a group of students at the magical academy in Rubrum. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>told</b> through two new members of Class Zero: Machina Kunagiri and Rem Tokimiya.

5|$|Final Fantasy XII, a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} released by Square Enix in 2006, {{revolves around the}} attempt to liberate the kingdom of Dalmasca from the Archadian Empire. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>told</b> {{through the eyes of}} Vaan, an orphan who wishes to be a sky pirate, and the cadre of other characters he encounters throughout the adventure. The visuals of the characters were designed by Akihiko Yoshida, while their stories were created by Yasumi Matsuno. The characters were designed to look and behave unlike any that had existed in the Final Fantasy series. Their stories were written to create a script where neither side was truly right or wrong, but instead just had different opinions and interpretations of the events occurring in the game.|$|E
5|$|Genealogy of the Holy War {{takes place}} on the {{continent}} of Jugdral, split between eight different countries founded by the Twelve Crusaders, an ancient group of soldiers who ended {{the rule of the}} ancient dragon Loptyr with divine aid. In the present, a cult working to revive Loptyr stir up war among the countries. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>told</b> over two generations — the first generation follows the Grannvalian prince Sigurd, while the second follows his son Seliph as he works to defeat the cult and avenge his father. Gameplay follows the traditional Fire Emblem system of tactical battles taking place on grid-based maps, while adding the Weapons Triangle and Support systems, which directly impacted both gameplay and story.|$|E

He meets a woman named Trish who takes him on a journey to defeat the demon lord Mundus. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>told</b> primarily through a mixture of cutscenes, which use the game's engine and several pre-rendered full motion videos. The game is very loosely based on the Italian poem Divine Comedy {{by the use of}} allusions, including the game's protagonist Dante (named after Dante Alighieri) and other characters like Vergil (Virgil) and Trish (Beatrice Portinari).|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Dearly Stars {{is similar}} to previous games in the series, but with new elements and differences to the minigames. The gameplay was adjusted to allow the player the option to quickly play through the game's story, but head director Toshihiko Kujioka also wanted to add in gameplay elements that would add another layer of challenge. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>told</b> {{from the perspective of}} Ai Hidaka, Eri Mizutani and Ryō Akizuki—three prospective pop idols introduced in Dearly Stars as they enter the talent agency 876 Production, and deals with their training on their way to stardom. The player has access to the three idols' different scenarios when playing, and each one involves a branching plot line.|$|E

Although the exact origin of the plague is unknown, a young boy from a village in China is identified as the plague's official patient zero. The boy's case marks the point where the Chinese government begins to take measures to cover up the disease, including generating a crisis with Taiwan to mask their activities. Nevertheless, the plague still manages to spread to various nations by human trafficking, refugees and the black market organ trade. Initially, these nations were able to cover up their smaller outbreaks, until a much larger outbreak in South Africa brings the plague to public attention.|$|E
