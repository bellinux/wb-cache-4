40|$|Abstract—This paper {{characterizes the}} sum {{capacity}} of a class of potentially nondegraded Gaussian vector broadcast channels where a single transmitter with multiple <b>transmit</b> <b>terminals</b> sends independent information to multiple receivers. Coordination is allowed among the <b>transmit</b> <b>terminals,</b> but not among the receive terminals. The sum capacity is {{shown to be a}} saddle-point of a Gaussian mutual information game, where a signal player chooses a transmit covariance matrix to maximize the mutual information and a fictitious noise player chooses a noise correlation to minimize the mutual information. The sum capacity is achieved using a precoding strategy for Gaussian channels with additive side information noncausally known at the transmitter. The optimal precoding structure is shown to correspond to a decision-feedback equalizer that decomposes the broadcast channel into a series of single-user channels with interference pre-subtracted at the transmitter.

30|$|Cooperative {{telecommunication}} {{systems can}} effectively {{be used to}} combat fading by exploiting the broadcast nature of the wireless medium [1 – 6]. In a classical cooperative communication system, only unilateral communication is considered: one <b>transmitting</b> <b>terminal</b> communicates to one receiving terminal {{with the help of}} a relaying terminal. Many practical applications however require bilateral communication, in which two terminals both send and receive information to/from each other. Using a classical (one-way) cooperative system in this situation would yield a poor spectral efficiency, as this would require four orthogonal channels, i.e., the two transmitting terminals need one channel each, and the relay transmits over two channels that the data received from the first and second terminal, respectively. The spectral efficiency can be improved using a two-way relaying system, in which the relay uses a single channel to simultaneously assist in the information transfer from the first to the second terminal and from the second to the first terminal.|$|E
