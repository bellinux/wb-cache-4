5000|$|Chief Justice Rehnquist {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion, noting the {{long tradition of}} attorney-client privilege and stating that, [...] "The great body of this case law supports...the position that the privilege does survive in a case such as the present one." [...] In response to Starr's argument that posthumous exceptions had been granted before, and that interest in whether a crime had been committed was sufficient reason to do so, the opinion noted that exceptions had been granted based on an implied waiver {{in order to fulfill}} the client’s <b>testamentary</b> <b>intent</b> (and necessarily implied the posthumous survival of attorney-client privilege), such as in estate disputes among heirs, {{and that there was no}} reason to suppose that [...] "grand jury testimony about confidential communications furthers the client’s intent." [...] Rehnquist wrote that attorney-client privilege cannot be reduced to the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, but is broader, encompassing concerns about reputation and civil liability. Rehnquist noted the potential chilling effect on attorney-client communications if an additional exemption were granted, writing that [...] "uncertain privileges are disfavored." ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{questions}} whether wills law 2 ̆ 7 s disapproval of partial intestacy rests on defensible assumptions about <b>testamentary</b> <b>intent.</b> After examining {{the causes of}} and antidotes to partial intestacy, I make three primary points. First, the presumption against intestacy applies only to wills that contain an ambiguous bequest of the residue. Second, the law 2 ̆ 7 s disapproval of partial intestacy {{is due in part}} to its failure to make an important distinction between testamentary intention and dispositive intention. Third, a theory of passive intention, heretofore barely alluded to in the law of wills, supplies the necessary validation of partially intestate estates...|$|E
40|$|Americans store an {{overwhelming}} amount of sensitive, personal information online. In email accounts, social networking posts, blogs, shared pictures, and private documents, individuals store (perhaps unwittingly) the secrets and {{details of their}} lives in an unprecedented manner. During an individual’s life, these accounts are seemingly under the direct control of an account holder. Privacy is occasionally threatened, but people continue to use online services and pour personal information into their online accounts. When developers created these online services and platforms, it is unlikely that they gave much thought to what would happen to accounts when an account holder died. Yet, the treatment of these accounts after an account holder’s death is an increasingly pressing issue in today’s society as more and more Americans die with active, password-protected accounts in their name. In determining how these assets will be handled at an individual’s death, powerful principles collide—including privacy, contract, property, and freedom of information. This Article discusses how privacy interests are traditionally terminated at death and explores how they should be revived and reshaped in a digital future. It argues that to align posthumous privacy interests with the needs of a digital future, the law must ensure that succession principles apply to privacy as well as property rights, and that decedents’ individual intent for the fate of digital assets is honored. The Article acknowledges that private contracts may be a sufficient tool to protect privacy after death in some instances, but argues that the lodestar in any discussion of posthumous privacy should be <b>testamentary</b> <b>intent.</b> In the absence of <b>testamentary</b> <b>intent,</b> state legislatures should enact default rules of digital asset succession that accord with the family-centered paradigm of inheritance...|$|E

40|$|The formal {{requirements}} of our highly structured succession law frequently frustrate both {{the goals of}} decedents and the basic purposes of the law itself. In this article, Professor Gaubatz reviews the goals of succession law and the ways the law as currently structured fails to satisfy these goals. He discusses {{the ability of the}} Uniform Probate Code to resolve these insufficiencies pointing to the lack of flexibility in the Code to work changes in result where factual deviations indicate change is necessary. Concluding that basic substantive problems remain unresolved. by the Code, the author suggests increasing the flexibility of inheritance laws by providing for investigation into individual cases to ascertain the extent to which underlying succession law policy is fulfilled. In addition, it is argued that many nontraditional forms of expression of <b>testamentary</b> <b>intent</b> be validated where the dispositive act is consistent with succession law policy. Finally, the author outlines how the proposed modifications would work in practice...|$|E
40|$|Succession law, the law {{governing}} trusts and estates, {{is experiencing}} an identity crisis. Similar {{to an individual}} going through a midlife crisis, the laws of succession {{seem to be in}} search of a new purpose or meaning. It seems odd that a legal discipline as old as private property succession law would lack the continuity of some shared jurisprudential image. Yet, despite its historical legacy, succession law appears to have neither a complete descriptive theory (explaining what the law is) nor a complete normative theory (explaining what the law should be), hence the identity crisis. It may seem intuitive that before lawmakers impose a consequence on property owners there should be a unifying normative basis for making the imposition or preferring the selected consequences of the law, or both. However, rule making in succession law seems to be implemented and developed in an ad hoc manner. Although scholars and legislatures tend to pay lip service to succession law 2 ̆ 7 s historical core goal of effectuating a decedent 2 ̆ 7 s <b>testamentary</b> <b>intent,</b> this once-central value has been cast to the periphery of legal relevance. Accordingly, the policy goals of succession laws are largely amorphous, with no consensus built around any particular theory. 2 ̆ 7 This patchwork nature of succession law, though, has proven to be fertile ground for scholarship. Succession law {{has been the subject of}} intensive analysis, debate, and exploration of different theories to justify and advocate the evolution of succession law...|$|E
