5|$|When a USB {{device is}} first {{connected}} to a USB host, the USB device enumeration process is started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device. The data rate of the USB device is determined during the reset signaling. After reset, the USB device's information is read by the host and <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> assigned a unique 7-bit address. If <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> supported by the host, the device drivers needed for communicating with the device are loaded and <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices.|$|E

30|$|The {{electrode}} {{patterns were}} made using an {{electron beam lithography}} (Vistec EBPG 5000 plus ES, Germany), and <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> <b>were</b> annealed in a chemical vapor deposition furnace. After that, the morphologies of <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> <b>were</b> characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM, NOVA Nano SEM 430, USA). The low-temperature electrical transport properties of <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> <b>were</b> measured on a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley- 4200), where <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> <b>were</b> placed in <b>the</b> liquid helium pot of a PPMS (PPMS- 9, Physical Property Measurement System, Quantum Design Inc., USA) instrument.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to limiting the total average power {{used by the}} device, the USB specification limits the inrush current (i.e., the current used to charge decoupling and filter capacitors) when <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> first connected. Otherwise, connecting a device could cause problems with the host's internal power. USB devices are also required to automatically enter ultra low-power suspend mode when the USB host is suspended. Nevertheless, many USB host interfaces do not cut off the power supply to USB devices when they are suspended.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One uses a 4.7 inch, 1080p Super LCD 3 {{touchscreen}} display with a {{pixel density}} of 468 ppi. The backside {{of the device}} houses the camera, the LED flash, and the secondary microphone. At the top of <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> a 0.14-inch (3.6mm) headphone jack and the power/lock key, which also functions as an infrared blaster. At the bottom is the primary microphone and a microUSB port for both data connections and charging; the device can stream HDMI via the microUSB port using MHL.|$|E
5|$|The {{device was}} {{available}} initially with three storage sizes, 16, 32 and 64GB and two varying connectivity options, Wi-Fi only or Wi-Fi and cellular. Each variation of <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> available {{with either a}} black or white front glass panel.

5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and core, and connected only at one end. <b>The</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
5|$|In the US and Canada, nine {{variations}} of the third-generation iPad were offered, compared to six {{in the rest of}} the world, although some countries had only the Wi-Fi only model. Each variation was available with black or white front glass panels, with options for 16, 32, or 64GB of storage. In North America, connectivity options were Wi-Fi only, Wi-Fi + 4G (LTE) on Verizon, AT, Telus, Rogers, or Bell. For the rest of the world outside North America, connectivity options are Wi-Fi only (on the Wi-Fi model) or Wi-Fi + 3G (on the Wi-Fi + Cellular model), with the latter unavailable in some countries, as 4G (LTE) connectivity for <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> not available outside North America. The Wi-Fi + Cellular model includes GPS capability.|$|E
5|$|The {{college is}} {{actively}} involved in the development and use of assistive technology to aid visually impaired people in their everyday lives. For example, working with a United States-based software engineer, RNC produced the T3 (Talking Tactile Tablet), a touch sensitive device for interpreting tactile images such as diagrams, charts and maps. <b>The</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> connected to a computer and run with a programme CD, and has a tactile surface which produces touchable icons that provide audio feedback when they are pressed. The device was originally developed for educational purposes but can be adapted for other uses. In 2005 Hereford Museum and Art Gallery became the first in the United Kingdom to invest in the technology. The T3 was later marketed internationally {{with the help of the}} UK Trade & Investment's passport initiative– a scheme which gives new exporters the training, planning and support they need to succeed in overseas markets.|$|E

5|$|The game's ending changes {{depending}} on whether the player has a radio beacon to call for extraction, and when the nuclear device is set to explode. Forgetting to set the bomb, or setting it to explode at any time past the awakening of the dreaming god, results in Earth's destruction. The device's detonation before the player reaches a minimum safe distance results in a pyrrhic victory. The most favorable endings are achieved by leaving the pyramid with a beacon for evacuation at least twenty game minutes before <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> set to go off; if the game ends with enough time for the player to escape on foot, the player survives without a beacon.|$|E
5|$|The iPad 2 {{supports}} iOS 8 {{which was}} released on September 17, 2014, making it the first iOS device to support 5 major versions of iOS (including iOS 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). While <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> still supported, {{most of the new}} features of the software are not supported due to relatively aged hardware and therefore, is limited in terms of performance. Users have also reported numerous problems after receiving the update including the accessibility features and battery-related issues. Many users predicted that the iPad 2 was going to be dropped from updating to iOS 8 along with the iPhone 4, the same process that happened with the iPhone 3GS and the iPod Touch (fourth generation) and earlier models, considering that it has been supported for more than 3 years.|$|E
5|$|Written by David Banks, {{the writer}} {{proposed}} the story {{around the time}} that he was engaged to play the Cyberleader in Attack of the Cybermen. The story is set in 2006, human scientists in Antarctica race to construct a device which will undo an imminent reversal of the Earth's magnetic field. However, the Cybermen are also present in Antarctica and are plotting to sabotage the device, giving them the opportunity to conquer the planet in the confusion caused by the reversal. <b>The</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> activated prematurely, crippling the Cybermen, and giving the Doctor the opportunity to stop the Cyber forces. Banks later adapted the story as a novel for the Virgin New Adventures range in September 1993 featuring the Seventh Doctor.|$|E

5|$|PlayStation TV, {{known in}} Asia as PlayStation Vita TV, is a microconsole and a non-portable {{variant of the}} PlayStation Vita handheld. It was {{announced}} on September 9, 2013 at a Sony Computer Entertainment Japan presentation. Instead of featuring a display screen, the console connects to a television via HDMI. Users can play using a DualShock 3 controller, although due to the difference in features between the controller and the handheld, certain games are not compatible with PS TV, {{such as those that}} are dependent on the system's touch-screen, rear touchpad, microphone or camera. <b>The</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> said to be compatible with over 100 Vita games, as well as various digital PlayStation Portable, PlayStation and PC Engine titles. The system supports Remote Play compatibility with the PlayStation 4, allowing players to stream games from the PS4 to a separate TV connected to PS TV, and also allows users to stream content from video services such as Hulu and Niconico, as well as access the PlayStation Store. The system was released in Japan on November 14, 2013, in North America on October 14, 2014, and in Europe and Australasia on November 14, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Randolph Chitwood, a cardiothoracic surgeon with East Carolina, {{performed}} the first minimally invasive robotic-assisted mitral-valve heart {{surgery in the}} United States. East Carolina researchers also developed an electronic fluency device called SpeechEasy; <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> designed to improve the fluency {{of a person who}} stutters by changing the sound of the user's voice in his or her ear. Walter Pories, a faculty member at The Brody School of Medicine developed the standard procedure for gastric bypass surgery. Researchers here also first discovered that 80% of obese/type 2 diabetic patients who underwent this surgical procedure had a reversal of the disease. The Biofeedback Lab is currently developing techniques to help service members recover from posttraumatic stress disorders and traumatic brain injuries they received in Afghanistan and Iraq. The in vitro fertilization program is ranked first in North Carolina and fourth overall in the United States. Jason Bond, a former scientist in the Department of Biology, discovered many new species of spiders, including Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi and Aptostichus stephencolberti.|$|E
5|$|USB2.0 devices use {{a special}} {{protocol}} during reset, called chirping, {{to negotiate the}} high bandwidth mode with the host/hub. A device that is USB2.0 High Speed capable first connects as a Full Speed device (D+ pulled high), but upon receiving a USB RESET (both D+ and D− driven LOW by host for 10 to 20ms) it pulls the D− line high, known as chirp K. This indicates to the host that <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> high bandwidth. If the host/hub is also HS capable, it chirps (returns alternating J and K states on D− and D+ lines) letting the device know that the hub operates at high bandwidth. The device has to receive at least three sets of KJ chirps before it changes to high bandwidth terminations and begins high bandwidth signaling. Because USB 3.0 uses wiring separate and additional to that used by USB2.0 and USB1.x, such bandwidth negotiation is not required.|$|E
