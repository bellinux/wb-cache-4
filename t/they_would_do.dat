Notable cut scenes include Jim and the others {{trying to get the}} truck into the warehouse door but getting the truck stuck instead, Dwight trying to use Kevin as a bumper on the oil track, and Phyllis, Toby, and Ryan revealing what <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if they won the lottery.|$|E
5|$|Working as an {{additional}} producer, Don Was helped keep Weiland's {{and the rest of}} the band's separate recording sessions in sync by bringing them together to perform live. When the band performed together, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> so acoustically, so each member could hear the nuances of the songs. Weiland credited Was for helping Stone Temple Pilots re-learn how to play together again. Was also worked closely with Weiland during the recording of the vocals.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} {{that they have}} lost Prestige Direct, Jim, Dwight and Harry retreat outside for a coffee break. They end up having a conversation over what <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> with their lives, {{if they were not}} working for Dunder Mifflin. Jim jokingly says that he would be a beet growing competitor during the national contests while Harry would retire after selling one big item such as an airplane. Before he leaves, Harry says that Robert will be the ruin of the company and says they will not be working for Dunder Mifflin in six months, leaving a look of concern on Dwight and Jim's faces.|$|E

5|$|After their {{experience}} of the perils and obstacles of government, the political figures who had arisen during the 1830s saw the Emperor as providing a fundamental source of authority essential for governing and for national survival. These elder statesmen began to die off or retire from government until, by the 1880s, they had almost entirely {{been replaced by a}} newer generation of politicians who had no experience of the early years of PedroII's reign. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity and saw no reason to uphold and defend the imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation. To them PedroII was merely an old and increasingly sick man who had steadily eroded his position by taking an active role in politics for decades. Before he had been above criticism, but now his every action and inaction prompted meticulous scrutiny and open criticism. Many young politicians had become apathetic toward the monarchic regime and, when the time came, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> nothing to defend it. PedroII's achievements went unremembered and unconsidered by the ruling elites. By his very success, the Emperor had made his position seem unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Alf was a musician, and {{specialised}} in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. He {{played the}} banjo, as did Julia, though neither pursued music professionally (Julia would later teach her son {{how to play}} the banjo). They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and dreaming of what <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> in the future — like opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club. In March 1930, he took a job as bellboy on board the Cunard passenger liner SS Montrose. He kept in touch with Julia, writing to her and meeting her whenever he docked in Liverpool. He was later offered a job on a whaling ship for two years—which could have earned him enough money to buy a house—but turned it down when he found out that Julia's father had arranged the job, so as to keep him as far away from Julia as possible.|$|E
5|$|In December 1843, Smith petitioned Congress to make Nauvoo an {{independent}} territory {{with the right}} to call out federal troops in its defense. Smith then wrote to the leading presidential candidates and asked them what <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> to protect the Mormons. After receiving noncommittal or negative responses, Smith announced his own independent candidacy for President of the United States, suspended regular proselytizing, and sent out the Quorum of the Twelve and hundreds of other political missionaries. In March 1844 — following a dispute with a federal bureaucrat — Smith organized the secret Council of Fifty. Smith said the Council had authority to decide which national or state laws Mormons should obey. The Council was also to select a site for a large Mormon settlement in Texas, California, or Oregon, where Mormons could live under theocratic law beyond other governmental control.|$|E

5|$|In Stage six (universal ethical {{principles}} driven), moral reasoning {{is based on}} abstract reasoning using universal {{ethical principles}}. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, {{and a commitment to}} justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. This involves an individual imagining what <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> in another’s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true. The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{began to}} gain {{prominence}} in the small Democratic caucus by opposing Reconstruction measures. His delaying tactics against fellow Pennsylvanian Thaddeus Stevens's military Reconstruction bill in February 1867 kept the bill from being considered for two weeks—long enough {{to prevent it from}} being voted on until the next session. He likewise spoke against what would become the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Although he opposed the amendment, Randall did favor the idea behind part of it: section 4, which guarantees that Congress may not repudiate the federal debt, nor may it assume debts of the Confederacy, nor debt that the individual Confederate states incurred during the rebellion. Many Republicans claimed that if the Democrats were to regain power, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> exactly that, repudiating federal debt and assuming that of the rebels. Despite disagreement on other facets of Reconstruction, Randall stood firmly with the Republicans (and most Northern Democrats) on the debt.|$|E
5|$|Wetherall {{was one of}} 19 senior first-team {{players to}} be laid off by {{chairman}} Richmond in May 2002, after the club were put into administration and the players unpaid since April. Those players {{went as far as}} taking strike action before a pre-season friendly at Hull City, even though Wetherall, as their Professional Footballers' Association representative, had initially denied <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> so, before the club was saved and players reinstated. Wetherall played in the club's opening game of the season as Bradford drew 0–0 with Wolverhampton Wanderers live on television, but was again ruled out through an injury, this time to his hip. A planned comeback was put off five weeks later, before he sought the advice of a specialist in Denmark. After sitting out another three months through injury, Wetherall made his return as a substitute against Gillingham in December 2002 but was again injured in a reserve team comeback three days later. He again returned in February 2003 against Coventry City and played 15 games during the final three months of the season.|$|E

5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E
5|$|Schneider started Vancouver's {{next game}} against the Calgary Flames. For the second-straight game, Vancouver lost a two-goal lead in a game which {{eventually}} went to a shootout. In contrast to his first start, Schneider had a strong game, making 34 saves {{by the end of}} overtime. In the shootout, he stopped four of the five shooters he faced, earning the Canucks their first win of the season. Two nights later, as they began their first road trip, the Canucks played a rematch with the Ducks in Anaheim. Schneider made the start and earned some redemption, stopping all 30 Anaheim shots, helping the Canucks to the 5–0 win and earning his fifth career shutout. Following the win, Schneider started the next game, a 4–1 loss to the San Jose Sharks. Luongo started the next four games, finishing off the month of January and beginning February. Vigneault joked that he was making his starting goaltender decisions based on coin tosses. He further noted that the two goaltenders were team guys and <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> what was asked of them and never complain. The coin became a running joke for Vigneault and the Canucks in general, as Ryan Kesler stated he flipped it before announcing his return from injury.|$|E

Both Francesa and Russo were coy about their future beyond the summer.
