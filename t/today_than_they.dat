His paintings, which he often worked on {{for ten years}} or more, were built up of layers of paint and varnish applied {{on top of each}} other. He would often paint into wet varnish, or apply a layer of fast-drying paint over a layer of slow-drying paint. The result is that paintings by Ryder remain unstable and become much darker over time; they crack readily, do not fully dry even after decades, and sometimes completely disintegrate. Because of this, and because some Ryder paintings were completed or reworked by others after his death, many Ryder paintings appear very different <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> did when first created. Many of his paintings suffered damage even during Ryder's lifetime, and he tried to restore them in his later years.|$|E

The southern half of the city consists of industrial zones and compact housing designed for early 20th century industrial workers, while the northern half has a suburban feel more typical of later decades. High wages paid to unionized GM employees have meant that these workers could enjoy a relatively high standard of living, although such jobs are much scarcer <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> once were.

[...] Addressing the faster rate at which defenders could reinforce an area than attackers could penetrate it during the First World War, Guderian wrote that [...] "since reserve forces will now be motorized, the building up of new defensive fronts is easier {{than it used to}} be; the chances of an offensive based on the timetable of artillery and infantry co-operation are, as a result, even slighter <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> were in the last war." [...] He continued, [...] "We believe that by attacking with tanks we can achieve a higher rate of movement than has been hitherto obtainable, and—what is perhaps even more important—that we can keep moving once a breakthrough has been made." [...] Guderian additionally required that tactical radios be widely used to facilitate co-ordination and command by having one installed in all tanks.|$|E

This is because many of the winemaking techniques used to make today's darker, more tannic red wines (such as extended maceration and harder pressing) were not widely practiced in ancient winemaking. Both red and white wine grapes were often pressed soon after harvest, with very little maceration time, by hand, feet or even sack cloth creating juice that was only lightly pigmented.|$|R

25|$|The {{choice of}} {{discount}} rate is subjective. A smaller rate values future generations equally {{with the current}} generation. Larger rates (e.g. a market rate of return) reflects humans' attraction to time inconsistency—valuing money that <b>they</b> receive <b>today</b> more <b>than</b> money <b>they</b> get in the future. The choice makes a large difference in assessing interventions with long-term effects. One issue is the equity premium puzzle, in which long-term returns on equities may be rather higher <b>than</b> <b>they</b> should be. If so then arguably market rates of return {{should not be used}} to determine a discount rate, as doing so would have the effect of undervaluing the distant future (e.g. climate change).|$|R
