30|$|In this paper, we {{used the}} option pricing method to {{systematically}} analyze the pricing of an inventory pledge loan and emphasized <b>the</b> <b>pledged</b> loan-to-value ratio. Compared with existing domestic research, the method of this paper has rich theoretical implications. First, each different loan term has its own pledged loan-to-value ratio, thus this method allows us to determine the term structure of <b>the</b> <b>pledged</b> loan-to-value ratio. Second, the method {{can be used to}} analyze the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>pledged</b> loan-to-value ratio and the loan interest rate. Third, volatility influences <b>the</b> <b>pledged</b> loan-to-value ratio, and therefore, this method can be used to analyze the manner in which <b>the</b> <b>pledged</b> loan-to-value ratio varies with different types of metals pledged. Lastly, risk attitude affects the determination of <b>the</b> <b>pledged</b> loan-to-value ratio. <b>The</b> major limitation of this method is that <b>the</b> matter <b>pledged</b> should be tradable. The option pricing method requires that the sales of the underlying assets can be transacted dynamically with a low cost. If <b>the</b> <b>pledged</b> property exists, a dynamic hedge of its corresponding futures product (for example, metal futures) can be achieved by futures trading. For a pledged property with futures that are non-tradable or require expensive transactions, we should introduce risk appetite or use the traditional method for analysis. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to articulate the theoretical framework and analytical method; the concrete conclusion and empirical implications will be offered in follow-up studies. Compared to the previous version, this paper summarizes and analyzes more related literature in recent years.|$|R
30|$|Our results {{indicate}} <b>the</b> following:the <b>pledged</b> loan-to-value ratio is a convex decreasing function ofthe term; and <b>the</b> <b>pledged</b> loan-to-value ratio is a concave decreasing {{function of the}} value volatility of the pledge; and <b>the</b> <b>pledged</b> loan-to-value ratio is a concave increasing function of the risk premium. For floating interest rate circumstances, we should specify the function form between the loan interest and the risk-free rate.|$|R

30|$|The main {{difference}} {{would come from}} the comparison with the cost associated to existing <b>pledges.</b> <b>The</b> market would imply a cost reduction of 65 percent with respect to <b>the</b> voluntary <b>pledges.</b> <b>The</b> reason is that <b>the</b> <b>pledges</b> are very far from the optimal solution implied by the market. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>pledges</b> would {{be very different from}} Member States’ true preferences, if the true preferences are correctly reflected in the Eurobarometer survey. The simulation is run under the assumption that countries’ true cost corresponds to these preferences rather than to the revealed ones from Table  1.|$|R
50|$|For {{a pledge}} to come into {{existence}} as a real security right, {{it is essential that}} delivery occur. Delivery can be actual or constructive, but the pledgee must retain possession of <b>the</b> <b>pledged</b> object. <b>The</b> transfer of possession is intended to publicise the fact that a real security right, {{in the form of a}} pledge, has been established over <b>the</b> <b>pledged</b> object. <b>The</b> transfer serves to protect the pledgee's real security right by preventing the pledgor from alienating <b>the</b> <b>pledged</b> object or pledging it to some other person. This is why constitutum possessorium is not permitted.|$|R

During his time in Iraq, Rice met with Colorado Governor Bill Ritter, Congressman Ed Perlmutter, and Congressional candidate Jared Polis during their trips to the country, and also met with U.S. Marine and Colorado state senator Steve Ward, who was stationed in Iraq at the same time. Rice returned to the legislature on January 28, 2008, and was received with a standing ovation during the morning roll call.|$|E
5|$|Director Sean Penn's <b>The</b> <b>Pledge</b> (2001), though {{adapted from}} a very self-reflexive novel by Friedrich Dürrenmatt, plays noir {{comparatively}} straight, to devastating effect. Screenwriter David Ayer updated the classic noir bad-cop tale, typified by Shield for Murder (1954) and Rogue Cop (1954), with his scripts for Training Day (2001) and, adapting a story by James Ellroy, Dark Blue (2002); he later wrote and directed the even darker Harsh Times (2006). Michael Mann's Collateral (2004) features a performance by Tom Cruise as an assassin in the lineage of Le Samouraï. The torments of The Machinist (2004), directed by Brad Anderson, evoke both Fight Club and Memento. In 2005, Shane Black directed Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, basing his screenplay in part on a crime novel by Brett Halliday, who published his first stories back in the 1920s. The film plays with an awareness not only of classic noir but also of neo-noir reflexivity itself.|$|E
5|$|The Torah {{provides}} four details {{regarding the}} traditions surrounding Joseph’s remains.

In Joshua, Joseph’s bones are said to have been brought from Egypt by the Children of Israel and interred in Shechem.The bones of Joseph, which the Children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, were buried in Shechem in a parcel of land Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver (qeśîṭâ)..|$|E

5|$|With his family, he {{took part}} in the 1764 {{election}} of the new Polish monarch, Stanisław II August. In December 1767, Pulaski and his father became involved with the Bar Confederation, which saw King Stanisław as a Russian puppet and sought to curtail Russian hegemony over the Commonwealth. The confederation was actively opposed by the Russian forces stationed in Poland. Pulaski recruited a unit and on February 29, 1768, signed the act of the confederation, thus declaring himself an official supporter of the movement. On March 6, he received the rank of a pułkownik and commanded a choragiew of cavalry. In March and April he agitated among the Polish military, successfully convincing some forces to join the Confederates. He fought his first battle on April 20 near Pohorełe; it was a victory, as was another on April 23 near Starokostiantyniv. An engagement at Kaczanówka on April 28 resulted in a defeat. In early May he garrisoned Chmielnik, but was forced to retreat when allied reinforcements were defeated. He retreated to a monastery in Berdyczów, which he defended during a siege by royalist forces for over two weeks until June 16. Eventually he was forced to surrender and was taken captive by the Russians. On June 28, he was released in exchange for a pledge that he would not again take up arms with the Confederates, and that he would lobby the Confederates to end hostilities. However, Pulaski considered <b>the</b> <b>pledge</b> to be non-binding, and made a public declaration to that effect upon reaching a camp of the Confederates at the end of July. Agreeing to <b>the</b> <b>pledge</b> in the first place weakened his authority and popularity among the Confederates, and his own father considered whether or not he should be court-martialed; some heated debates followed and Pulaski was reinstated to active duty only in early September.|$|E
5|$|World War I {{had a large}} {{impact on}} the school. A newfound sense of patriotism had the {{administration}} require students to recite <b>the</b> <b>Pledge</b> of Allegiance as an entrance requirement to the school. The war also {{had an effect on}} enrollment as all of the male students gradually left the school to join the war efforts; in 1916 there were 421 total students, 382 in 1917, 172 in 1918 (including only one male student), and in 1919, 147 students. In addition to the students, some of the faculty members joined the military. Due to the decreased student enrollment, the remaining faculty had the opportunity to further their own training. On campus, both students and faculty worked with the Red Cross, organized bond drives, and sent packages to troops overseas.|$|E
5|$|By the {{following}} day, 29 November, the garrison's water supply had been exhausted. The {{walls of the}} fort had also collapsed and the garrison was exposed, leading to further casualties amongst the Nepali troops. Seeing the disheartened state of men, the Captain and other officers asked them to sign a pledge {{to fight to the}} last. Eighty-four soldiers signed. However, that night the Mleccha Kalanala Company, which had arrived as reinforcements and was stationed at a portico east of Nalapani, secretly abandoned their post, taking with them their arms and colours. Seeing this, some of the men who had signed <b>the</b> <b>pledge</b> followed. The 50 or 60 men that remained, overcome by the hopelessness of the situation, felt that instead of confronting certain death by remaining in the fort, it was better to escape to the hills and hold their position there. Perhaps unable to convince their commanders with words, the escaping men caught hold of their Captain and other officers by their arms, and dragged them away from the fort. Learning of this new movement, the British renewed their fire; but the Nepalese managed to cut through and make a successful escape.|$|E
